206,The Marker Hotel hit the mark!,"From the moment I entered the Marker Hotel until I (unfortunately) left, I felt welcome and totally taken care of. This hotel is in a lovely location, perfectly walkable to sites in Dublin and has a unique charm all its own. The concierge were helpful and professional and the room was cleaned and well maintained. Meals at the restaurant were delicious and the servers were attentive. The gem of this hotel is the spa. I couldn't get enough! I will certainly consider staying at the Marker again if I'm ever in Dublin again. What a special oasis! ",5,2024,10,10
206,Beautiful hotel with great staff,"Beautiful hotel with excellent customer service, luxurious rooms and an amazing spa. I would skip the breakfast due to it being overpriced but Herbstreet is a great close option. Benjamin was a true gentleman and very professional. Loved the canal view and proximity to the theatre and a grocery store. The mini fridge was filled with mini bar items, would‚Äôve preferred space for personal items. The cleaning service wasn‚Äôt as expected for a hotel or this caliber but overall we‚Äôd give it a 5.",5,2024,10,08
206,Luxurious Afternoon Tea Experience,"From start to finish, our afternoon tea experience was fantastic. Our waitress, Abbey, explained the concept of the afternoon tea and the flow of it.
The Champagne is absolutely gorgeous üòç
And the sandwiches, scones and desserts are to die for ü•∞

We went for my mother in law's 70th birthday and I'm delighted that we chose The Marker, it was just fab!
2 of pur party don't eat meat, so they made substitutions for us, which were very helpful.
Amazing food and service...",5,2024,10,03
206,5 start luxury at its best,"We just got back from an amazing stay at Anantara The Marker Hotel and I have to say, it was incredible! From the moment we walked in- we were given a proper Irish welcome! The  staff at the desk were super friendly and invited us for a drink at the lounge before we went upstairs. The entire F&B team very courteous, accommodating, attentive & so very efficient. 

It was our anniversary- and the team had some handcrafted petit fours waiting for us in the room with a personal note from the General Manager, welcoming us wholeheartedly. The room was pure luxury‚Äîso comfy and stylish.

As for the food, wow! Every meal was delicious, with a great variety to choose from. Emmanuel in the bar was so nice and showed us around the hotel. Breakfast was a standout, with so many options that I didn‚Äôt know where to start. Our breakfast waiter was amazing as well ( I am forgetting her name) I have to say this was one of the best breakfast spreads I have seen in Europe. 

All in all, my time at Anantara the Marker was fantastic. I can‚Äôt recommend it enough, and I can‚Äôt wait to go back!",5,2024,09,30
206,Memorable Stay in Dublin,"Wonderful facilities and outstanding staff.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a good time in Dublin and beautiful hotel!
Hotel right to the theater and concierge
Got us beautiful seats to Hamilton. 2nd time we saw but better than Broadway!

206,Another Great stay with the marker,"5th time staying with the marker and its just an all round great experience for a weekend away.
Spa is fantastic great breakfast and lovely choice of cocktails. we always make use of the concierge parking which is so hassle free giving its location in dublin.  
one of the comfiest hotel beds i've slept in.",5,2024,09,27
206,How did I not find this hotel sooner !,"Wow what a cracking hotel stayed one night for business and wish I knew about this hotel before, I‚Äôm in dublin a number of times a year and will be returning!

Great check in very welcoming and informative great room 334, lovely massage as well in the soa, great I amenities and a top shower.

Will be returning!",5,2024,09,24
206,modern and calm,"we used to stay at the Gibson however after an oversight on our part and not being able to get a room at the Gibson we found the Marker! best thing we have ever done. This hotel has everything you need for a fantastic time in Dublin. The rooftop bar has a great view, the spar has a beautiful long pool and you feel like you are swimming in a grotto. The main restaurant has a great choice but my favorite is the baked prawns! One great thing is you are just a 15 to 20 minute stroll into Dublin center. Highly recommend!",5,2024,09,20
206,Luxurious,"The professional and friendly staff is what makes this hotel great! Staff on door, reception, spa, restaurant, cleaning and maintenance; Thank you all for the great experience. Go raibh maith agaibh. ",5,2024,09,17
206,Marker hotel Dublin,"We had an excellent stay. Room large and very clean, friendly staff, lovely full Irish breakfast and evening meal. Loved the spa and had fantastic massages. Highly recommend the hotel",5,2024,09,12
206,Overrated and overpriced,"The sad part of my trip was to hear employees at the restaurant also house keepers that you are short of staff because the hotel pays the minimum wage and your salaries are low the reason why people don't want work for the hotel and leave every one or two months, we had to wait longer than usual. You charge sky-high prices to your customers. The food was not bad , the rooms are fine but I would not recommend your hotel at all. Rich people using poor people to get even richer.",2,2024,09,08
206,Great Stay! Portal Perks & Service = Amazing!,"Visited in September '24. I stayed with my family in two separate rooms: one booked through the AMEX Fine Hotels & Resorts portal and the other through the Chase Sapphire Travel portal. I usually feel wary about booking through third-party sites, but it worked incredibly well at this resort.
The hotel staff is exceptionally helpful and goes out of their way to ensure your comfort. The hotel restaurants are good, and the breakfast was delightful. Room service was prompt and delivered by a wonderfully pleasant team member. The pool and spa area features two saunas‚Äîa regular sauna and a eucalyptus steam sauna‚Äîwhich were magnificent, as well as an infinity jacuzzi. It was my first time experiencing an infinity jacuzzi; it was really cool!
When traveling to the touristy or shopping areas, the hotel is not the most convenient to Temple Bar or Grafton Street. However, it was very easy to hop on a bus at the stop next to the hotel, and just a few stops later, you find yourself in the center of many popular sites. This hotel serves as a quiet refuge away from the town, where relaxation and service are the main focuses.",5,2024,09,05
206,Amazing stay in this hotel,"Received complementary room upgrade. Rooms immaculate and spacious. Voya amenities in bathroom. Spa was beautiful. Breakfast fantastic, both buffet and a la carte, also could have sparking wine if wanted. 
Location was fine for me, but I‚Äôd say a little far from city centre. Approx 25-30 min walk to Grafton Street",5,2024,09,02
206,Money stolen,"We had cash stolen from our wallet while we left the room to go to the pool. There were 2 housekeepers in the room at the time. We reported it to the hotel, who said they would investigate. Very disappointing for a hotel of this caliber. We are so disturbed and feel violated. 
The hotel itself is nice and clean. However, with the safety issues here I would look elsewhere.",1,2024,09,01
206,2 cheers for the Marker and Emmanuel,"Emmanuel is new to the hotel's lobby bar. He always makes my visit worthwhile  with his positive attitude, can-do spirit and fab cocktails. I have never seen someone work so quickly to achieve the best customer service while also keeping the quality top-notch.",5,2024,08,31
206,Fantastic hotel but has flaws that need to be fixed,"This is one of the nicest hotels in Dublin.  Great location and very nice rooms.  Clean, modern, comfortable, etc.  Everything you would expect from a premium property.

The lobby bar offers a nice respite from the noise of Temple Bar.  

The bell staff, concierge, housekeeping and front desk staff were very good.  

Where this hotel has stumbled since my first stay is two fold.  

1. The rooftop is not nearly as vibrant as it once was.  The interior furniture is mismatched and the chairs look like they came from the hotel's ballroom.  Seriously dull and uninviting.  The wait staff seems totally disinterested in serving.

2. The lobby bar is still nice but the wait staff there is also aloof and disinterested.  We were there two evenings, neither super busy, but not dead.  The wait staff would look right at your thirsty party and ignore you.  Best bet is to go to the bar where they are actually working hard.

So the theme here is focused on the wait staff.  But be warned that the kitchen closes early.  Roof top deck stops serving around 8:30.  Lobby bar 9:00-ish.  Restaurant stops seating at 8:45.  Room service won't deliver to the lobby.  And room service really closes at 10:30 with a very limited menu after that.  If you call for room service close to (but before) 10:30 they try to tell you the kitchen is closed.  What gives?  The food and beverage leadership needs to fix this.

Breakfast was good and they work hard to make it so.  So, I think they can do better.",4,2024,08,27
206,A perfect stay,"I had high expectations of Anatara. The one I stayed at previously in Thailand was spectacular. I was not disappointed. I knew the property was not originally an Anatara so my expectations of room size was adjusted. I saw the hotel and area in early August but had pre booked a hotel near Stephen Green. I saw that hotel was in an over crowded tourist area so after a busy time in Ireland with family and a wedding I lost my pre book amount to treat myself to the Anatara. They didn‚Äôt disappoint. First, location is quiet but walking distance to attractions and the pedestrian areas, next to the theater and on the water. You can see local people going about their day. The service stands out. They called me by my name at each encounter, looked me in the eye, and offered a smile. If you don‚Äôt want to be bothered put the sign on your door. If not you‚Äôll get treats and a welcome trio of goodies. They came to my door 3-4 times a day including service. I tried the Spa and my therapist was wonderful. The room was perfect and very comfortable. Also I had a great view. The bed was the most comfortable of my trip. The comforter was light, soft and snuggly.üòä Finally, the price was lower than most inner city hotels in the USA. Definitely a 5 star stay. Thank you üôè",5,2024,08,22
206,Great hotel,"My wife and I and son and his partner stayed here one night to attend Wicked in the Bord Gais. Great location as it‚Äôs only a few steps from the theatre. Valet parking was very convenient but check in was very slow, had to queue then seemed to take a long time to allocate the 2 rooms. The room was as expected at this level, spotlessly clean, quality bedding, towels and bathrobes. Big TV. Breakfast buffet has to be about the best I have had in any 5-star hotel with fabulous range of continental and hot options. The Bread and butter pudding with Baileys was delicious. Only issue at breakfast was a delay in hot food order from the menu but staff apologised for the delay and offered Cava which was gratefully accepted. I look forward to staying here again.",5,2024,08,19
206,Poor customer service,Desperately slow checkin.  Room not up to expectation.  Flagged to duty management.  Unsatisfactory outcome‚Ä¶. Will not be staying at another Anantara in my lifetime as there are sooooooo many other hotel brands that do care about their guests satisfaction,1,2024,08,17
206,SHAKEY START...FABULOUS ENDING,"After a very shakey start, we ended up having a fabulous stay.  We chose this hotel to celebrate our sons birthday, and after a bit of a shakey start and a quiet word with a fabulous duty manager, the whole stay turned around.  A good manager works there magic in the background, and she most definitely did her magic, and our stay went up a level.

Our son was treated as special and important as we feel about him and said he had an amazing stay, which means everything to us.  All the staff were great top of their game.  I would definitely stay here again.  I didn't get the name of the duty manager that day, but she enhanced our sons 18th birthday celebrations, so thank you.",5,2024,08,09
206,The Marker,Fantastic Hotel! Location is Perfect! Staff is Excellent! Everyone was So helpful and Kind! Would recommend to Anyone booking for the First time and unsure if they are picking the right Hotel!,5,2024,08,08
206,Breakfast is the best of our Ireland trip,There are a wide variety of fruits with high quality. The homemade juice tastes good. The types of meals ordered are quite diverse.,5,2024,07,31
206,Wonderful stay,We stayed for our anniversary and the service was excellent. The staff and customer service was fantastic from arrival to departure. ,5,2024,07,30
206,Amazing from start to finish!,Brought my wife and child to the Bord Gais Theatre to see a show from the minute we arrived till we left i have to say we have stayed in many hotels but this was just exceptional.  For nice touch with the welcome fizzy drink that was delivered to the room for my child.  Room was amazing check in staff bar restaurant staff so friendly and so helpful there is nothing i could say negative.  Great Hotel will def be back again.,5,2024,07,24
206,Perfect birthday stay,"Booked here for my partners birthday during December and the hotel met all my expectations. Greeted by Kevin, on the door, who was brilliant. He was also really knowledgeable about the area, routes to take and recommendations on places to visit. Check in was quick and easy and we were given some refreshments while we waited. Our room was very spacious and the bathroom very luxurious. Spa and treatments were also 5 star. 
Located close enough to walk into Dublin centre but far away from all the noise. Perfect stay and wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to book another stay here in the future.",5,2024,07,23
206,"Could have been great, except for ""lost"" Switch","The hotel facilities were top notch. Really enjoyed the welcome drink and cookies. However, our child had his Nintendo Switch (with charging cord and converter) go missing from the room. The staff investigated but ultimately did not take responsibility for the disappearance. We watched him put it down in the morning and it was gone when we got back. Disappointing.",3,2024,07,23
206,Very very disappointing. Nothing like a 5 star experience at all.,"Hugely disappointing. We were booked in here by a tour guide who promised it would be wonderful, but it was nothing special at all. Our ""luxury suite"" had dismal views and there was a very noisy Wetherspoons across the street full of loud drunks. The hotel seems to form part of the Boy Racer circuit of downtown Dublin, and we were kept awake by noisy cars racing around the streets outside until late at night. 

Our king bed was much too soft and the pillows wrapped around your neck and face, making it feel like I was being suffocated all night. I woke up with a sore neck after a very poor nights sleep here. The sink drain and the shower tray drain were both blocked, so water escaped all over the bathroom floor when we used them. The toiletries provided were low quality and smelled like Toilet Duck ! It was 50 degrees outside (10F) but some bright spark in housekeeping put on the very noisy air conditioning when we arrived and the room was freezing cold, with cold air blowing on the pillows. 

We had been promised a bottle of champagne in the room as part of the high priced package, but it was cheap Cava, the brand you get at the local Spar. Yuck. 

Breakfast was very ordinary and not anywhere near the quality this hotel advertises. There was only one lift working for the entire hotel, so it was crowded and busy all day long, with long waits to get up and down. 

If you want an authentic Irish experience, this is not the hotel to choose. All the staff are foreign, with a poor grasp of English and very heavy accents. I guess they get them cheaper from the agency that way.  It reminded us of a cheap grey airport hotel on an industrial estate, not a 5 star hotel in a prime location in one of Europe's most colorful cities. We felt ripped off here. Save your money and go elsewhere.",2,2024,07,22
206,Too expensive for the facilities provided,Lift was not working for 4 days. Felt disappointed to pay 350+ euros per night for 4 nights with the services provided. ,3,2024,07,19
206,"Wonderful, fairytale","If I had to imagine from now on a dream hotel where I could stay during my travels I would certainly think of the Anantara in Dublin. 
What was missing? Absolutely nothing. 
I felt pampered in every detail starting from the transfer that they kindly provided me. 
They ""put up with me"" when my plane was 3 hours late and promptly notified the transfer and changed the dinner time. 
I would have gladly moved to the room I was given, it was beautiful and spacious and overlooked the theatre. 
The food is exquisite, whether we are talking about the restaurant or the rooftop and both are absolutely worth trying, because they are different and wonderful things in equal measure. 
At the restaurant I tasted international cuisine, the cooking of the meat was perfect, the grilled cauliflowers were delicious and then the dessert!!
At the rooftop I was able to taste one of the typical Irish whiskeys and many other delicacies, I was even given a blanket since the climate was cold for me.
The staff was super friendly. The spa area is well looked after and very relaxing.
This hotel is perfection. On this trip of mine he gave me a fairy tale where gentlemen apologize to let you enter the elevator first, making you feel like a princess. Next time I return to Dublin I will definitely stay here again!",5,2024,07,17
206,Better than last time ‚Ä¶ but not worth the price,"The feeling is of a hotel impersonating a 5 stars. but delivering a 3. The most friendly staff were footman personable porter Ivo  and attentive Illian at breakfast. The corridors and rooms are in a dark paint that shows too many cracks for a new hotel; the tap for the bathtub was missing, the nespresso machine defective, one of the only two elevators was constantly out of service causing long waits, reception is obsessed about payments‚Ä¶deliver the impression that guests would try to leave without paying. The best thing is the breakfast menu, even if they serve eggs without toast ‚Ä¶ something is overall missing in this hotel that is located out of the way, near a theater, but in a neighborhood without atmosphere: not worth the high tag prices",3,2024,07,11
206,Fantastic service,"I attended the marker with my family last week for drinks and food on the rooftop bar, outstanding service from all the root top staff especially Yasmine on the roof top desk who were so welcoming and attentive. The views were as good as the staff I will definitely be returning. I would also like to mention Kevin on the front door who greeted  us with a friendly smile the customer service was fantastic!",5,2024,07,09
206,Birthday celebrations at the marker,We had booked the lounge for pre theatre drinks and snacks on Saturday 6th July for my sisters birthday. We got a gorgeous seat outside as the sun was shining. We shared a bottle of cava brut enjoyed some lovely tapas and finished with two lemon bon bons.,5,2024,07,08
206,Absolutely amazing,"Just back from a night at the hotel and will defo be back at some stage this year!!! Absolutely gorgeous!!! They sent up chocolates to our room for our anniversary and when we came back they had the room ready for us to sleep for the night. Most amazing hotel we have been too. Thank you for making our anniversary so special. The staff, the drinks, everything was amazing.",5,2024,07,06
206,Should have been 5 star,"Booked 6 months in advance a weekend in Dublin as a big birthday/anniversary trip with my wife and a night at 3arena. Most expensive room I've ever booked but wanted it to be amazing and I guess that's why I ended up a bit disappointed.

It is a fabulous hotel in a perfect spot with a great view , pool, rooftop bar and does feel luxurious. But...
-We arrived and they had no record of our booking. We sat for an hour with a complimentary drink waiting for a room, which knocked back some plans for before the show that evening.
-Told Breakfast not included and must have been my fault at booking somehow but more on that below.
-No mention was made of our celebrations.
-Room beautiful and little things I know but: temperature control knob broken/unadjustable, ornate wall-to-ceiling bedside lamp unadjustable/dangling, charging station not working
-Paid for breakfast both mornings and it was fantastic. But noticed on bill charged 26euros one morning and 32euros the next. E-mailed customer service saying mistake in billing and after several exchanges, no refund/apology but informed we were under-charged one morning and as a gesture of goodwill they will overlook it. (apparently it depends how you book it as to the price...)

It is obvious there are a lot of corporate guests staying here who I'm sure aren't going to see a bill or complain when the company is paying. I can't help but be left with the feeling The Marker doesn't need people like us going and has grown complacent towards them. Never been to a hotel and felt like a bit of an inconvenience before.

I've waited to post a review but have chosen to having spent what for us was a LOT of money on a weekend I expected to be perfect.
And whilst I didn't let it spoil our trip, it really wasn't.
And it so easily could have been.",3,2024,07,02
206,Lil trip,"Was an enjoyable stay, nice spa and bar is great and lively. Will definitely come back as the place was lovely ",5,2024,06,27
206,Absolutely worth every penny.  Our new go-to in Ireland.,"My recent stay at this hotel is one of the best that I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.  So much so that I cancelled a previous hotel stay later in our vacation to come back to this hotel.

The staff is exceptional.  I truly did feel like anything I needed was only a question/call away.  We drove from the airport, about 25 minutes.  We tried parking in the garage around the corner but it was full.  If it is full, when you leave, just ring the assist and let them know there were no spots and they will lift the gate for you so you don't have to pay.  So instead, we drove up to the Valet parking (only 8 Euros more a night).  The moment we pulled up we were greeted by the Valet and then escorted to the front desk for check-in.  Everything was explained, the young lady made sure there were no further questions and showed us to the lift where we would then go to our room.

Our room was decent sized, plenty of room for 2 (or even 3).  We got settled, viewed all the ins and outs and then went down to the restaurant to eat.  While not cheap, it is not super expensive either.  And the food, while a little salty for my taste, was still good.  Honestly, that was probably the worst part of the whole stay (but if that is the worst part -- hey, ill take it).  The sommelier was so helpful in helping me choose a wine to go great with my meal - and it was the perfect choice.

By the time we got back to the room after dinner the bed had been turned down and some little chocolates left for us :-)

Breakfast is OUTSTANDING.  Do not miss it if you can.  It pretty much filled us for the whole day.  They have a menu where you can order a la carte and a buffet.  You can mix and match.  There truly is something for everyone.  It happened to be included in our stay so it was definitely a money saver as we did not need to eat lunch and did not have a heavy dinner.  

Check-out was a breeze.  Any credit we had was immediately applied without even asking and took a total of about 2 minutes.   

As I mentioned before we enjoyed our stay so much we cancelled our hotel we had booked for the night before our flight home and rebooked this hotel.  A week later and everyone that we encountered the first go-round remembered us this time!  We got there a little early so we dropped our bags and went for a walk to the Temple Bar area (about 20-25 minute walk).  When we got back our room was ready and our bags were already brought to our room.  Bonus -- our room this reservation was even bigger :-) Great big bathtub that my wife enjoyed along with a little sitting area, and of course, our little turn down chocolates :-)

If you want to splurge, this is the place to do!  It will be our go-to if (more likely, when) we are back in Dublin.  My wife enjoyed the brand so much she wants to start looking for them when we are visiting other cities.",5,2024,06,20
206,AMAZING!,"I travel a lot for work and this hotel is by far my most favorite. The rooms are very nice, cozy and clean! The hotel staff is so lovely. Especially Derek, he takes the time to talk to you even though he is very busy. He makes each customer experience unique. Everyone welcomes you when you walk into the hotel. I have yet to meet someone here that isn't friendly. They are all so helpful and accommodating. This is my fourth time here and I seriously love it every time I am here. I look forward to coming back each time and I never want to leave. Whether it be for business or pleasure, I HIGHLY recommend the Marker Dublin Hotel. I promise you that you will not be disappointed. One of these days I will be bringing my family back here to experience this wonderful place with wonderful people.",5,2024,06,17
206,Luxurious stay,"We love this hotel and have now made it a yearly tradition. Cannot fault anything. From food to staff, to guest rooms and spa facilities, all are a 10/10.",5,2024,06,11
206,No longer 5 star,"Very sorry to write this review as this hotel was traditionally my favourite in Dublin. In spite of the great location, well appointed rooms and quality of food, service here is severely lacking. If you‚Äôre happy to wait an hour for a drink, an hour for your breakfast, wave like a crazy woman for service from waiting staff - then this is the place for you. 

Wait staff have no interest in working tables that are not in their section, and good look finding the waiter / waitress that was supposed to take care of you. I came away feeling sorry for the excellent managers who are working with staff who have little interest or competency in this industry. It is very frustrating for everyone. This hotel gets the difficult things right and the easy things so very wrong. The waiting staff could care less and appear to have limited experience in hospitality. It must be noted that managers were very kind in offering complimentary services for our bad experience which we appreciated. That said, I would prefer not to complain about basic bad service. It would be much easier for everyone if the waiting staff hired did their job correctly. It should not be such a major problem. 

You won‚Äôt find an Irish welcome at this hotel - unfortunately as a result of basic service. It has certainly lost its appeal. This hotel is far from 5 star as a result. Such a pity.",3,2024,06,03
206,"It's okay, but.....","Pros:
+ Nice staff
+ Good bars (rooftop and lobby)

Cons:
- Windows don't open for fresh air
- Plastic layer on the mattress makes sleeping very uncomfortable

The location in the Docklands is convenient for business but it takes a while to reach popular tourist destinations.",3,2024,06,02
206,"Great hotel and location, not as accommodating as other hotels on our trip","Staying at the Anantara was enjoyable, and most of the staff was lovely, but the front desk staff‚Äôs unwillingness to accommodate changes to our group‚Äôs reservation was a letdown. Their inflexibility detracted from our overall experience",3,2024,06,02
206,Nice but Not American-Friendly / worth the price,"Staying at the Anantara was enjoyable, but the staff‚Äôs unwillingness to accommodate changes to our reservation was a letdown. One person in our party was not able to get an extra room key until demanding it as well due to ‚Äúhotel policy‚Äù.

Their inflexibility detracted from our overall experience. Would not return for the price.",2,2024,06,02
206,"Good quality interiors, but bad inflexible overpriced service and they‚Äôll nickel and dime you like dimwits. Will never c","They initially refused to give me a key to my room and insisted on the needing to wake up sleeping wife in order to get into my room. 

We stayed one night as planned and they didn‚Äôt have our room ready upon arrival at 1pm so we left and returned at night separately. I arrived later in the night from my wife and child. They gave me this room access refusal (same last names and ID) all after having changed in the lobby out of my suitcase and doubling the fees unexpectedly to over $600/night USD. Why they didn‚Äôt even think to ask for proof of payment is beyond me. They also charged my friend $8 for a bottle of water at the bar. 

Good quality interiors, but bad inflexible overpriced service and they‚Äôll nickel and dime you like dimwits. Will never come back again and recommend you stay away!!",1,2024,06,01
206,When you want to splash out on yourself and be treated like a celeb!,We went to The Marker Hotel to celebrate our friend's big achievement at work. We were treated so well from start to finish. We had cocktails downstairs in the lovely outdoor area. Then we had dinner in the restaurant before going to the rooftop bar for more cocktails. The place is immaculate and they think of everything. We were even given gorgeous blankets on the rooftop when the night drew in and became colder. We want to give a special mention to Ricardo in the restaurant and Abbey on the rooftop terrace who looked after us so well and went above and beyond to make sure we had a great celebration. Thank you Ricardo and Abbey.,5,2024,06,01
206,When 5 Stars Isn‚Äôt Enough,"There are almost no words to describe this unbelievable experience.  From the moment we arrived we were treated with exceptional hospitality.  The doorman, conceirge snd reception were all 5 Star level of service. We secured a junior suite corner room and it was spectacular. Spacious and luxgeriois. It must be a nice hotel if the National Football Team just stayed in the same floor as you.  We will definately be coming back. The spa is superb and location is perfect.  They also went above and beyond when they didn‚Äôt have to for us and we are more than grateful.",5,2024,05,28

206,"Beautiful rooms, bar service leaves a lot to be desired","I have stayed here several times over the years and always enjoyed my stay. Rooms are beautiful and very clean. Turn-down service is a nice touch. We were here to celebrate a birthday which the hotel knew and left a gift in our room which was appreciated. However I really felt this time that the bar service let the hotel down. We arrived in just after 11pm and the lady told us they usually close around 12.30 or it would depend how it went, we didn't feel very welcome and got the impression they were looking to close early. It took a long time, around 20 mins for someone to take our order, despite there being plenty of staff and it didn't seem exceptionally busy. When our order was taken, it says as clearly forgotten about as after 25 mins we were told it was last orders if we wanted to order another drink, despite not haven even received our first. No apology was offered for the long delay. We asked could we order another drink and the lady said she would have to ask her manager, which she did and we were told they couldn't serve another drink, even though it wasn't our fault the order was forgotten.
This experience left a lot to be desired and definitely dampened our evening. For what one pays to stay in the Marker I would expect better bar service and it will definitely make me reconsider staying in future.",3,2024,05,20
206,Not great.,"Not 5 stars in my opinion. We stayed here at the beginning and end of a recent trip to Ireland, So two separate stays, two weeks apart. On our first stay the room had to be re-cleaned as the bathroom and carpets were dirty. Not a great first impression. While we were waiting we then ordered some food and it was greasy and inedible - mezze board and buttermilk chicken, not good at all. The following morning we had breakfast......and it was poor. No one inquired why the food had barley been touched, it was just taken away.

We've stayed in many Anantara's and the breakfast has always been a highlight, this time it was cold, uncooked and many staples like brown bread had simply run out - it was 8.30am - very disappointing for an Anantara.

One of the two lifts wasn't working on our first visit and low and behold it wasn't working again on the second stay. We got a sullen look from the doorman when we arrived back and of course no acknowledgement at the front desk that we have already stayed with Anantara many times.

I'd have let this all slip but for the reason that our room had not been cleaned during the entire last stay, even when we asked them to do so.  Upon arriving back to the uncleaned room on our last night, I spoke with a manager about all this and he promised me he would email me to discuss further. He comp'd us two pints for the hassle and as such a week later no email from him has been forthcoming.

All in I believe there to be a big communication disconnect between departments and staff. Wrong opening times for the spa were given by the front desk and overall I'd say this this is more like a 4 star hotel definitely not the 5 star Anantara experience we know and love.",3,2024,05,20
206,Top notch,"What a property and staff. 

From the moment of arrival you are given the five star treatment. From the doormen grabbing your bags, opening doors and greeting you in a professional manor. 

Checkin was seamless and professional. Our room was changed and upgraded because of an odour my attention had noticed when she initially checked in. 

The room we had was spacious, comfortable and five star. We had a great view of the water , an incredibly comfortable bed and a super spacious bathroom with a huge tub and powerful shower.

The pool at the property was excellent, bigger than expected and not busy when we used it. We made the most of the steam room and sauna  to help in relaxing.

Breakfast was excellent with all the trimmings and top service you‚Äôd expect. We also enjoyed a few drinks at the bar which  had a great ambiance and energy with an extensive menu. 

I highly recommend visiting this property for pleasure or business. It‚Äôs a great location and amazing service, amenities and staff. Five star.",5,2024,05,18
206,Meh~,"This was disappointing at best. We had a corner junior suite so the view was lovely. The breakfast was also well done. That was it. It isn‚Äôt really near the city center, is a walk and after a few days that looses its charm.  Not near main attractions. The lighting is awful, bathroom is dark and the mirror lighting was broken. Hair dryer was broken and panel around light switch fell off. It was our anniversary and on day 3 we received a bottle of wine- it was addressed to Mr. McKey only, and that is not our last name. This was a big hotel and that‚Äôs exactly what it felt like. Nothing special. Would not stay here again.",3,2024,05,17
206,Solo trip to Dublin,I had a wonderful time at the Anantara. My room was spacious and well-designed. I loved the deep soaking bath tub and the overall aesthetic of the room and the hotel itself. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was delicious and I was thrilled to find fresh honeycomb which was a nice touch. The concierge and team were super friendly and accessible. I also enjoyed the walk from the hotel to the city center. I found it easy to get around the city from Anantara and it as a great place to have as a homebase. My only wish is that the hours for the hotel spa were a bit longer on weekends--I missed an opportunity during my short visit to use the spa but I look forward to next time. I felt safe and supported as a woman traveling alone. I will be returning.,5,2024,05,11
206,An absolute joy to visit!,"The Marker hotel massively exceeded our expectations for a city centre hotel; combining a handy location with exceptional service from the staff. The room was spacious and had a lovely view of the 'sticks'. The hotel had kindly left a welcome gift for my wife's birthday, which was massively appreciated. 

The spa/pool was compact, but actually really relaxing to use. Overall cleanliness was brilliant throughout the hotel.

The breakfast was frankly extraordinary! A huge range of food, plus A la carte options cooked to order. Absolutely no problem providing gluten free options. And the availability, friendliness and knowledgability of the staff was second to none. In fact, this was true throughout, including reception and the concierge staff who provided great advice for our stay, along with assistance with valet parking.

More generally, we found the Uber/taxi drivers to be great and not too expensive (certainly compared to London!). Just be aware that it's not a fixed price ride. The bus/tram service looked good, but you need to purchase a pre-paid card, which wasn't readily available (they still don't support contactless payments).

We had booked The Marker thinking it would be good, but still a step down from our second hotel. How wrong we were! Plaese pass our appreciation and positive feedback on to all staff.",5,2024,05,10
206,Always a fantastic stay ,"Again, another amazing stay here at the marker. It's our absolute favourite, a gem for escape. The staff are fantastic in every area they can't do enough for you. The room was spotless and spacious with a nice view of the river. The food is good. Not a whole  variety from the menu, but we were fed. I do think their cocktails could be better if I were to be picky. Spa is always a nice chilled area to hang out. Wish they would put the temperature up a bit it's freezing, guys. We are in Ireland, and we need a few more degrees. 
Nice location right beside the board gais. Will absolutely be back again. We love it here. Feels like you're in another country. ",5,2024,05,09
206,Fantastic Hotel Experience,"Anantara The Marker Hotel!  I had never heard of it before and selected it only because our first choice was unavailable.  I thought it might be too modern for our tastes, and wanted a more ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù Irish hotel experience.  What a stroke of good fortune befell us that we stayed here; it was destiny!  This is one of the very best hotel experiences we have ever had.  The staff is genuinely warm and welcoming and will do anything and everything to accommodate your every wish.  I told my family that I suspect their training program must include the direction that they never say ‚Äúno‚Äù to any guest request.  Nothing we asked was too much, and over and over we were asked what else they could do for us.  As our favorite breakfast waiter told us ‚Äúanything is possible‚Äù.  The location was fantastic for strolling and chatting and relaxing and eating in the whole harbor area.  The hotel itself, with the spa and gym and restaurant was exceedingly comfortable, and the service was just STELLAR.  Cannot recommend highly enough.  Kudos to the staff at the Anantara ‚Äì you are amazing and much appreciated.",5,2024,05,08
206,"Slight room for improvement, but loved it and will be back!","First stay in this hotel since it was taken over by ANANTARA, we stayed previous to this when it was under previous owners and loved it. The renovations are lovely and really add an extra level of class. Couldn‚Äôt fault the staff, all really lovely and helpful, room well maintained and cleaned- turndown service is a lovely touch. The door man Kevin was a gent and looked after us for parking and gave good recommendations about the area and other ANANTARA hotels which we have since booked! 

Cocktails from the menu are lovely and food is very good in the bar, we also ate in the restaurant, it was good but not fantastic- food was warm but not hot and we expected a little more given the status of the restaurant and the price. 

Breakfast is great! A small buffet and cooked to order fry, pancakes etc

Spa is nice, staff are lovely and pool is nice but while we were in the pool the staff came and cleaned it as we were in it which I found really off putting and could not relax, had a massage but being honest did not enjoy it.

My only complaint is that I ordered a mimosa in the bar one day and was charged ‚Ç¨21 for essentially orange juice it was not made right and that is not me being picky it genuinely was orange juice that was so thick and not meant for a mimosa, I watched the girl make it and she poured 3/4 orange juice and a dash of Prosecco that just sat at the top of the glass- this is not the correct ingredient proportions for a mimosa- I should have said something and asked for another by it must be an Irish thing as we just accept things and don‚Äôt want to be awkward or complain. Didn‚Äôt ruin the stay and will 100% be back but was just a note, if charging that price for drinks they should be excellent and made correctly by trained bar staff. I have never been anywhere, even less rated star hotels that don‚Äôt know the correct proportions for a mimosa so I really was quite annoyed.

Myself and my husband are experienced travellers of 5 star hotels and holidays as a result of saving and working hard, it is not just handed to use and as a result we expect a certain level maybe more so than someone who is well off and wouldn‚Äôt think to spend ‚Ç¨21 on a drink. 

Overall cannot wait to come back again to visit The Marker :)",4,2024,05,02
206,Fit for royalty,Great place to stay . Has everything you need and want. Close to everything. Not much else to say . Next time will stay in a cottage but this stay was grand,5,2024,04,22
206,Lovely Hotel,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Anantara The Marker. Our room was modern, clean and had a stunning view of the Grand Canal, Grand Canal Square and Bord G√°is Energy Theatre. The hotel itself was contemporary and well-kept. In addition, the staff were polite, friendly and helpful. 

Breakfast was delicious, it has a varied buffet style selection along with a menu to order from. 

When we visited the spa, it had a relaxed and positive atmosphere and was very quiet. We did not get a treatment so cannot comment on that. 

It was our first time visiting Dublin and we both agreed we will be returning to Anantara The Marker.",5,2024,04,22
206,Disappointing response to theft,"Whilst at this hotel, someone was able to steal my boyfriends belongings from the locker at the spa/wellness centre. This included his passport, phone, wallet and clothes. Whilst I appreciate that the staff at The marker cannot control the actions of guests, the service we received in the aftermath felt dismissive, cold and lacked any sense of urgency and compassion. This is not true of all of the staff, as some showed us genuine kindness. The hospitality and support that we received from other Dublin agencies that we sought out, like the Garda, ITAS, and council was nothing short of outstanding which highlighted to us how unhelpful the hotel felt, especially after being robbed on their premises. I have never left a bad review previously, but would be reluctant to recommend anyone stays at this hotel as I do not believe that any lessons have been or will be learned from our experience.",1,2024,04,22
206,Worst 5 star hotel in Ireland.,"I stayed in this hotel about a year ago and enjoyed it. However, on this occasion I was not impressed to say the least. The mattress is full of dips and was very uncomfortable, needs replaced. The room was very dusty (which is unacceptable in any hotel never mind a 5*) and the bathroom tiles and back of the door have not been cleaned for a long time. The carpet looks like it hasn't been hoovered for weeks or months. The carpets in the corridor could also do with being shampooed.
The air con is terrible in the room, it takes a long time to bring the temperature down to 20 degrees.
There was only one lift working to service all the floors, this led to long waiting times and very full lifts.
The receptionist thought it was a good idea to put us in a room with an adjoining door to a family room with 2 young children. 7am every morning we woken out of our sleep by 2 screaming and crying kids. Terrible to say the least.

On a good note, the food is very good and the staff are very friendly and professional. The location is good. 

I will not stay here again under any circumstances. There are much better hotels to stay in Dublin such as the Intercontinental and the Fitzwilliam",1,2024,03,31
206,I expected so much more,"I wish I checked out with ‚Äúthat nice, happy feeling‚Äù. But it was just nothing special about it. Not worth the money. The room was nice, but bad air conditioning. It also had stains on the bathtub from previous guests wine glass. ",4,2024,03,27
206,Gorgeous hotel,"Such a stunning hotel, everything from the staff to the rooms were incredible, I will definitely be back, the location was so convenient, the staff in the bar were so friendly and accommodating, thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2024,03,25
206,A fantastic stay,"Had a fantastic time at the marker, all the staff were friendly. The room was beautiful and one of the most comfortable beds I‚Äôve ever slept on. Breakfast was fabulous. I have to make special reference to Kevin the valet who managed to find us a space without a car park reservation and who managed to get us a taxi very quickly on short notice. Such a warm, friendly gentleman who went above and beyond.",5,2024,03,25
206,"Great place, great service!","This is a well appointed hotel with everything you need.  We came in at about 10 am after a redeye flight hoping to store our luggage until our room was ready.  To our surprise and delight we were out in our room right away.  We were able to shower and get going on our day.  The room was nicely decorated in a dark and moody way.  Bed, pillows, and towels were great.  Location is good,  we would recommend it,

There is a nice strip of food places and a bank just across the courtyard from the front of the hotel.   We got Italian coffee and French pastries at Il Valentino coffee shop at the end of that block.  We were told it was the best coffee in Dublin.  I believe it.  We went there every morning.  We had a decent pizza at the little Italian diner across the street.  We also were able to get snacks at the grocery on the same strip.",5,2024,03,11
206,An Unforgettable Escape - The Marker was 5 stars all round!,"Our stay at the Marker Hotel surpassed all of our expectations, from the moment we arrived, Kevin, a member of their exceptional staff, greeted both my partner and I and welcomed us which set the tone for our entire stay. 
The attention to detail extended beyond the reception desk, as we were pleasantly surprised to find that parking our car was effortlessly taken care of by the attentive valet service. This small but significant touch added to the overall convenience and luxury of our experience.
We were kindly given an upgrade to our room, which was, to say the least, outstanding. 
We enjoyed the spa the next morning which made the stay a perfect relaxing experience. 
Thank you to all of the staff at The Marker, we will definitely be back. If you're looking for a truly exceptional hotel experience in Dublin, The Marker Hotel is the perfect choice.",5,2024,03,10
206,Luxurious stay,"Great hotel, loved the warm reception by Brian and great service. Loved the spa was so relaxing. Thanks to everyone for the warm welcome. The beds were so comfy I didn‚Äôt want to get out of bed. Great pool for swimming and amazing facial treatment.",5,2024,03,07
206,Bar staff ruined our stay,"Arrived back to hotel after having a few drinks in the city. We wanted a quick drink at the hotel bar to have a sneaky bar man take our order, then scurry off to get a manager to refuse us service, to then have two security guards follow us. 

The general manager would not have a face to face meeting to find out about how shocking the treatment we received.

A director of operations still would not admit fault of the staff in creating unneccessry drama.

I looked forward to a relaxing night but I highly recommend you avoid this place at all costs. Staff & Management will let the hotel down facilities drastically.",1,2024,02,23
206,Very nice hotel we really enjoyed our experience from start to finish.,"Hotel is situated in a great location and easy to find, the staff were very friendly and professional, the entire hotel from the lobby,bar,restaurant and Spa were wonderful, our hotel room was really nice good size room and importantly a very comfortable bed.",5,2024,02,19
206,Absolutely exquisite night out.,"We recently had a truly memorable dining experience at Forbes street in the Marker Hotel. The food was exquisite, with carefully prepared dishes and exceptional flavors. The menu offered a variety of options to cater to different tastes. The restaurant had a warm and inviting ambiance, with elegant decor and cozy seating. The staff, led by the attentive and hospitable manager Mathieu, provided impeccable service throughout our visit. I highly recommend Forbes st. for a special dining occasion. Truly unforgettable. Thank you Mathieu and team. Keep up the excellent work.",5,2024,02,19
206,Truly First Class,"Everything about this property is First Class.  From the Receptionists, to the Bellmen, to the rooms, to the spa, to the swimming pool, to the bar, to the restaurant, to the location.  I cannot recommend a stay here when visiting Dublin any more emphatically.  A special ""well done"" is deserving to Kevin who truly personifies the the true ""class"" of The Marker experience.",5,2024,02,14
206,Great hotel but it‚Äôs all about the people!,"The Anantara was the location of our recent company conference.

The location is a bit of a walk from the city centre (15 mins or so) but at the same time it still feels as if you are immersed in Dublin with the views of the canal and quays. 

The rooms were extremely comfortable and mine was generous in its proportions. The level of cleanliness was very high and there were some really nice extras such as chocolates after turndown and very high speed internet connection which unfortunately can be rare if in a hotel of this size. 

The service was exceptional. From the moment I arrived the team at the hotel were so welcoming and warm. A very special mention to two of the team in particular ‚Ä¶

Peter in the business centre looked after my colleagues and myself - it was as if he had a magic skill of being both invisible when we were busy but always there when you needed him. He was so helpful and managed the operation there with incredible skill.

As for Kevin at the front door, wow! He is like the cherry on top when it comes to the Marker. He had some great stories of his years in the business and he was on hand whenever needed. He‚Äôs a very special part of the overall experience.

Overall it was a really nice stay - comfortable, I was well fed, great facilities, amazing team.  Next time I go I hope to use some of the other facilities and I am already looking forward to going back‚Ä¶",5,2024,02,14
206,Beautiful hotel,"A truly beautiful yet not stuffy hotel. Maria on reception was outstanding and the bar tenders made great cocktails.

206,Top Quality Hotel about a mile from the city centre,"This is a high quality 5* hotel located in the docklands/financial district about a mile along the river from the city centre, so it's a bit of walk in but it's along the river so perfectly pleasant. 
The Marker has everything you would expect from a hotel at this price point; modern, comfortable rooms, nice restaurant (we only had breakfast there but it was lovely) and a decent sized indoor pool and gym in the very swish wellness area.
There is a rooftop bar but it's not open in winter - which on one hand I get, but there are plenty of ways to make a rooftop space available in the colder months.",5,2024,02,07
206,A perfect stay,"A perfect stay, I could not find fault it if I tried. Heavenly jacuzzi and you have to try the 'Lemon Bon Bon' at the bar. We were three hours early and we were delighted to be shown to a room straight away. I am already planning my next stay. ",5,2024,02,05

The marker is in a very quite location so no outside sound at all..
The manager Derreck was very friendly and could not do enough for me, the staff in general are the best part of this hotel and recommend heavily for anyone to stay here for a true five star experience!
Also a special mention to Rebecca and Ivan on bar and Julia and Bertha in forbes Street restaurant. ",5,2024,02,05

The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, from Kevin greeting us and taking care of our car, to Pieter and all the front of house staff, who made check in so easy. 

We received a complimentary upgrade, and the room included a lovely note and sweet birthday surprise.

The hotel has been totally modernised and the rooms are very quiet and the furnishings are all top quality. The pool and spa area were all very relaxing, and the sauna and steam room were all functioning very well.

The food was excellent, and check out was easy.

Our room was beautiful, very dark and contemporary with pops of colour, the bed was very comfortable with a choice of pillow types  which we really welcomed.  We loved the bar in the hotel and the staff there were amazing, they remembered our drinks order after one round and for every night after that :).  The icing on the cake, was our trip to Gareth Mullins restaurant in the hotel, Forbes Street.  Our food was spectacular , the service by Julia was perfect and she made our night for us.  We subsequently met Mathew the restaurant Manager who was very professional and ensured everything was how it should be and finally we got to meet the man himself, Gareth Mullins.  We listen to Gareth on the Pat Kenny show every Friday morning and can tell you he is just as down to earth in person as he is on the radio.  The food that Gareth is producing is just spectacular and very good value overall.   I cannot recommend this restaurant or hotel highly enough.

Excellent service from all the staff but particularly Guilliamo (William) when we checked in. 
Standard check out was 12, which is great but we were able to extend until 1pm for no extra charge. 
Nice buzzy atmosphere in the evening, and a 15-20 minute walk to grafton street.

We stayed for 3 nights at the end of December and into January and we actually miss it!
Breakfast was extensive, the Spa great for a few hours' relaxation and the bar area a lovely setting for drinks.
Just on the outskirts of town (about 15-20 minutes walk) but that means it's much quieter than city centre hotels.
An absolute gem of a hotel, I 100% recommend this to everyone. ",5,2024,01,03

206,The Perfect Destination,"Our recent stay at Anantara The Marker Dublin exceeded all expectations, thanks in large part to the impeccable service provided by the doormen, Kevin and Nicholas. Their friendly smiles and eagerness to assist created a welcoming atmosphere right from the entrance. It's rare to encounter such genuine warmth and professionalism, and their presence added a personal touch to our stay.

The attention to detail in our room was exceptional. The carefully curated design elements, plush furnishings, and high-quality amenities showcased the hotel's commitment to providing a luxurious and comfortable experience. From the turn-down service to the well-stocked minibar, every detail was thoughtfully considered, contributing to an overall sense of indulgence.

The seamless service extended beyond our room, with the entire staff demonstrating a commitment to guest satisfaction. Anantara The Marker Dublin stands out not only for its stylish and comfortable accommodations but also for the outstanding hospitality provided by Kevin, Nicholas, Maria, Michael and the entire team. Our stay was truly delightful, and we look forward to returning to this gem in the heart of Dublin.",5,2023,12,29
206,Felt like home,Everyone was very welcoming. Staffs are very warm and friendly. And very helpful. We love that the staffs always have a smile on their face and always asks hows our day. Room condition is excellent. Kids felt safe going around the hotel. We would come back again if we are ever in Dublin next time.  ,5,2023,12,26
206,You can do better Anantara Dublin,"Anantara is a lovely establishment, but was not happy with the hotel room which had no lights at the entrance and alarm kept going off thus brings a disturbance from staff who kept on knocking at the door.",3,2023,12,24
206,Great nights sleep,"Excellent staff and lovely food. beautiful nights sleep. The rooms have everything. Lively bar, perfect for a night cap. Ask for Kevin on the door if you need anything .  The location is excellent and offers parking. Thank you. ",5,2023,12,20
206,Great hotel in Dublin,Just back from a two night stay. Lovely hotel in a good location. Fantastic breakfast and friendly helpful staff. The pool is also great with a gym and spa attached. Would stay again and highly recommend. ,5,2023,12,18
206,Not a 5 star experience,We went in for a coffee before a show at the Bord G√°is Theatre. We were seated in the very corner of the room and ignored for 15 mins. There were plenty of staff floating around but no one came back to take our order so we just got up and left. I had a room booked with them for this summer for myself and my husband but based on this experience I have since cancelled. If you are charging 5 star prices you need to give 5 star service.,2,2023,12,17
206,Fantastic Hotel!,"I stayed two nights and this hotel was one of the highlights to my trip to beautiful Dublin (Baile Atha Cliath). The staff was super kind and helpful, the rooms are top notch and the breakfast is great! No complaints whatsoever and I thank them for the awesome experience ",5,2023,12,15
206,"Poor Check-in Experience, Delayed & Rude","Our company booked four rooms in November to attend a function in Dublin. Upon arrival, we were all due to check in at 3, only one of the rooms was ready for check in, while two of my colleagues had to wait for their rooms. We needed the rooms to work remotely as the lobby was too noisy so this was a big inconvenience. My colleagues ended up waiting close to two hours for their rooms. When I was checking in, the concierge outside was very friendly & helpful with my luggage & car, however the receptionist was very abrupt and not welcoming in the slightest. Very disappointing experience overall due to this, this was not our first time staying at the Marker so I was taken aback by the poor check in experience as my previous experiences were positive. There was no offer of any late check out in lieu of the rooms not being ready for 3pm, nor any other gesture to acknowledge the inconvenience the delay caused. Also, we arrived down for breakfast the following morning to find that it was closed - on the website it says breakfast until 11 but during the week the breakfast finishing at 10.30, we couldn't find this information in our rooms & when I tried to call reception to check I got no answer, so we assumed 11am based on the website information, so we missed breakfast on account of that. The hotel is beautiful, the porters are really kind & welcoming, but the reception & check-in experience, as well as the in-room information could really be improved, very disappointing given that it is a 5 star hotel.",3,2023,12,11
206,Amazing stay at the Marker,This place has vastly improved recently. The welcome outside was warm and friendly. The reception team are incredibly efficient and lovely to chat to whilst they're sorting all the details out. Very comfy bed and a deep bath. Best night's sleep in a long time. Thank you!,5,2023,11,30
206,Best in Class in Dublin,"Hands down - one of the best hotel service experiences I have ever had.  The staff are incredibly knowledgeable and friendly.  They took care of getting me a rlast-minute eservation for a Michelin star restaurant that was on my list; took the time to tell me about the hotel's architecture and design, provide d excellent service in the bar area, etc.  There wasn't anything that I would have suggested be done differently.  Well done, Anantara.",5,2023,11,30
206,Nice BUT‚Ä¶,"It is a nice looking, modern and clean property, staff is polite‚Ä¶BUT eventually lack of training and of service hit the guests. They advertise to offer a  ‚Äúbusiness center‚Äù, but the front desk lady answered that there was none other than a room with a computer without printing or copying facility so documents had to be emailed to the front desk to be printed or copied. At my surprise, a resident manager showed up and led me to the ‚Äúbusiness center‚Äù that they advertise: a room used as storage with a computer,  a wireless printer and a techno wizard by the name of Mr Peter‚Ä¶eventually, after a few tries, he had to concede and admit that the document was not printing. Wait, it gets better: at check in I was asked for a credit card for incidental and told that a charge of 50 euro would apply for incidentals and credit: common practice; I charged dinner to the room and after a few minutes there was an insistent knocking at the door, in spite of the ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù sign: ‚ÄúMaam, I gave the charge at the front desk, but they said that there is no credit on your room, you need to pay‚Äù ‚Ä¶ so I called the front desk and it turned out that they had indeed my card on file, but the young lady forgot to process the charge for incidentals‚Ä¶after some apologies I was told that it would be communicated to the restaurant staff, but obviously the message did not reach the person outside my door that started pounding again, like I would run away without paying the damn overpriced dish of bresaola. Facility wise, they have a good looking Spa with an extra small gym, a pool, and  1 sauna and 1 steam room to accommodate both men and women, but the lady that shows around explains reassuringly :‚Äú you can wrap around a towel if you do not feel comfortable‚Äù; dulcis  in fundo‚Ä¶they do not even have creamers for the in room coffee/tea. I would say that it is going to take a very long time and training before this can be considered ‚Äúa leading hotel‚Äù‚Ä¶good luck guys, you have got long way to go in front of you!",3,2023,11,28
206,Impeccable Service,"We have stayed at almost 40 hotels in our trips, Anantara took the top spot for us because of the customer service of their staff. The quality of food, the amazing rooms and the great location. The staff went above and beyond to make sure we are comfortable and satisfied. ",5,2023,11,28
206,Unforgettable time away.,"Service from start to finish was outstanding, the staff cannot do enough for you, and always with a smile. Special mention to Emelie, she was so friendly, very professional and provided the most amazing service in the restaurant.
Room, spa and all facilities were 5 star. We will sure be back.",5,2023,11,21
206,"The Marker Hotel, Dublin","Staff at front desk could improve, not very friendly. The rest of the hotel and spa staff were great, great location to the Bord G√°is and valet parking was handy. Rooms were lovely, we had the Sunday Spa package which was brilliant!",4,2023,11,15
206,Luxury at its finest!,"The service here is unmatched. Ivo, Iliana and Maria were really really helpful and sweet. Made the bartender made the best drinks. There wasn‚Äôt one bad experience at this hotel. So impressed with everything. Spa services were lovely as well. Highly recommend. Location was central and easy to navigate to everything. Will return.",5,2023,11,14
206,Birthday gift for my wife- Spa and overnight stay,"Had a wonderful time at The Marker. Wonderful room, very clean and accommodating. The spa was great! The staff were kind and very talented. The pool, sauna, and steam room were clean and very available. The staff was kind and helpful. Breakfast was awesome. We really enjoyed our stay",5,2023,11,13
206,Tranquil location in Dublin,"Would stay again absolutely. Friendly, helpful professional staff from the moment you arrive. Easy walking location and lovely spa area on site. Beds super comfortable had great quiet sleep and appreciated the complimentary water in glass bottles. Gorgeous marble bathroom. ",5,2023,11,09
206,Uilhas is an absolute asset to this hotel!,"The best restaurant we have ever dined in! We came here as a birthday celebration during our holiday to Dublin from Newcastle and it couldn‚Äôt have been a better experience. We preordered our food in advance and it couldn‚Äôt have gone more smoothly. Uilhas is an absolute credit to this hotel! So polite, efficient, friendly and welcoming. He is an absolute asset to this hotel. The hotel and restaurant is beautiful and the food matches the environment perfectly. Every course of food we had was absolutely beautiful, the service impeccable and special touches throughout the meal that made it even more special. We couldn‚Äôt rate this restaurant more highly and we already can‚Äôt wait to return on our next trip to Dublin!",5,2023,11,07
206,Amazing Staff,"We stayed here over the bank holiday weekend.
 When we were booking in there was a problem with our booking confirmation, which was my fault as I couldn't find it on my phone.
This process took a bit to sorting out but the girl on reception could see that we were visible upset and gave us an upgrade to a beautiful junior suit and a complimentary breakfast. From start to finish our stay was so luxurious from the spa treatments right through to breakfast. Thanks again to the lovely Spanish girl at reception we will definitely be returning.
     ",5,2023,10,31
206,Wonderful Hotel and Staff,Chose this hotel at random and turned out to be a real gem. Staff are very helpful and professional. Breakfast is excellent and it is in walking distance of the main visitor area . Room was amazing and would definitely use this hotel again and now look at other hotels in this chain,5,2023,10,29
206,Fantastic!,"Loved this hotel! First time visiting Dublin, front desk was so helpful down to getting us cabs to booking train tickets. The breakfast buffet was was fantastic and the coffee..  sigh..  I‚Äôm a coffee connoisseur and wish I knew where to buy that coffee! 
Location, I would say it‚Äôs in the middle of city, needed cab to Trinity College area and one to city center.  All in all a great stay!",5,2023,10,29
206,Great Hotel in Dublin,"I would stay here again.  Staff is top notch, good location within walking distance to tourist attractions.  The hotel is beautiful and well-maintained.  This hotel represents what a 5 star hotel should be.",5,2023,10,20
206,Beautiful hotel experience,"We absolutely loved our two day stay at The Marker Hotel. Will most certainly recommend it to our friends who are planning a visit to Dublin.
The staff were very pleasant and accommodating to our every need. Very helpful with making our stay very nice.",5,2023,10,10
206,"Refined style, great location","The room was incredibly appointed with high-end furnishings and great style (5/5). The 4 meals I had were nothing but delicious (5/5). The staff (restaurant, bellhop, reception) were pleasant, professional, attentive, and warm (5/5). The gym was part of the spa which means it was clean and had nice touches - refrigerator with cold towels and a bowl of whole apples for an after workout snack. All free! High recommend. ",5,2023,10,07
206,Hotel Experience,"Everything was great, and the hotel staff was so kind. I did not know what to expect, as the entire visit was a gift from friends with whom I was traveling. I would hope to travel to Dublin again. I am grateful for the experience and interaction with very welcoming staff.",5,2023,10,07
206,"Fantastic service, incredible hotel, faultless wheelchair access","This hotel was on our bucket list for a while so when Bill turned 40 we were treated to a night there. We both use wheelchairs and in terms of access they simply cannot be faulted. The bed was an easy height for a transfer, there was a lower wardrobe rail and plenty of space to move around. 

The bathroom was also completely accessible with a height-adjustable sink, a wheel in shower (with wall seat) and separate bath with grab rails, additional grab rails also next to the toilet.

When we arrived (wheelchair parking is available), Derek, the concierge/manager, helped us with our bags and gave us bottles of water whilst assisting us to check in. He then gave us a tour of the hotel on the way to our room. He took the time to show us all the facilities in our room. 

As we were approaching the reception desk he asked us if were celebrating anything and when Bill said it was his birthday, Derek arranged for champagne and cake for us on the rooftop terrace. On the way to the rooftop terrace, one of the managers Graham, also asked Bill if we were celebrating and when Bill told him about his birthday, Graham organised for more champagne and cake in the downstairs bar after we had enjoyed the rooftop terrace. The food, drinks, atmosphere and views from the rooftop terrace were incredible. The staff on the rooftop terrace were also very accommodating.

Throughout our stay all the staff,  Derek and Graham particularly, went over and above to look after our every need. After leaving, Bill downloaded the GHA Discovery App and is already planning our next stay!

206,Lovely hotel by the water,"Came to Dublin for a hen weekend 11 of us, hotel is in a lovely spot by the water, about 25min walk to Temple Bar area or plenty of taxi's available if you ask at reception. Very helpful, friendly concierge gave us water on arrival and held our bags as we were too early to check in so we had breakfast in the Wetherspoon next door. Rooms were comfortable, warm and very clean, with lovely toiletries, robes & slippers, lighting was really dim as it seemed to be throughout the hotel. Pool is a great size and gym looked ok, breakfast was very good, lots of self serve choice as well a menu to choose from. I would stay here again.",5,2023,10,03
206,Fabulous hotel ,"Sent my parents to the hotel to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. They had a lovely time. Staff were outstanding, room was fabulous & food was really good. It was walking distance to Bord Gais Theatre. The hotel had a complimentary bottle of champagne plus handmade chocolates in the room for them when they arrived to celebrate their anniversary. Thank you for making their stay very special ",5,2023,10,02
206,Very good service when we arrived at short notice.,"Our flight was canceled and we need a room or actually seven rooms for our group. From Anantara we got corner suites for everyone at very short notice. Not the chepest option but much better than airline first offer which was hostel. 

Anantara service was first class at reception and our late night dinner was very good. Only thing which was annoying was that we had early morning flight so we did not have time to enjoy enough about this fine hotel.

Please tell everyone who were at work in night of 19.9.2023 that your service saved our day.",5,2023,09,28
206,A special occasion ,"The staff and service best I have experienced in a very long time ( Yasmin, Brita, Ivan, Diego). A kitchen issue in the rooftop bar meant we couldn‚Äôt eat there but a table was arranged for us in the lounge. Food and service were exemplary. We look forward to our next visit. ",5,2023,09,24
206,"Nice hotel, service falls a bit short","The hotel is very central and feels luxurious. I've rated it 4 stars because the high price simply isn't justified by the experience that was nowhere near a 5-star hotel. Here are a few examples:
* Reception person told us the spa/pool closed at 9pm. When I went there at 8pm, it was closed.
* I was charged for the room twice, and refunded a slightly different amount two days after checking out.
Doesn't fill me with confidence.
* The breakfast buffet was quite underwhelming
Bland, and with limited vegetarian options.
* We left the room at 10am and when we came back around 4pm, housekeeping hadn't been there.
I think a key problem may be high staff turnover with insufficient training. Several staff I spoke to were polite but very new in their jobs and were unsure how to do it well.

That said, the room we got was comfortable and large, and the bed was really good.",4,2023,09,17
206,Quality service,"Wonderful experience with some of the best service I've had worldwide. I've stayed at equally nice hotels all over the world, from Europe to Asia to South America. This Dublin hotel makes you feel comfortable and makes your stay a lot easier. Staff is very knowledgeable with it's surroundings. They know where the shops and churches and other places of interests are. ",5,2023,09,15
206,"A beautiful hotel, no detail spared","I can‚Äôt recommend this hotel enough. Everything was first class, no detail spared. 

The breakfast buffet was by far the best I‚Äôve ever experienced. You won‚Äôt find many places who serve bowls of fresh strawberries (I always judge breakfast on the fruit availability as it usually sets the standard). The smoothie bowls were a firm favourite. And my husband loved the traditional Irish breakfast. The choice of al a crate or buffet was very generous. 

The drinks were on the expensive side but the accompanying atmosphere was worth it. Especially on the rooftop bar. 

The spa was beautiful. I had a full body massage and the experience was relaxing from start to finish. The sorbet and orange juice at the end was a lovely surprise. The swimming pool was great but there‚Äôs little room to chill and relax in the pool area itself. However this didn‚Äôt dampen the experience. 

Our room was absolutely stunning. I‚Äôm not sure if we were upgraded as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. But it was beyond beautiful! My husband organised some champagne and roses on arrival, which blew me away. The nightly turn down and chocolates was a lovely treat too! 

Thank you for such a wonderful stay. It was everything we needed and more - I‚Äôm hoping we can come back one day! 

",5,2023,09,15
206,Dublin and Belfast,Relax but not service for 5star hotel. Toilet in room very small and dark. Good amenities but the frigo bar is empty not like a deluxe hotel. The spa is very good but not a lot of chairs to relaxing‚Ä¶.,3,2023,09,13
206,Beautiful hotel with excellent service,"Beautiful hotel. Excellent service from the staff. They were always looking to go the extra mile, despite us staying at the hotel over a very busy weekend where the hotel was at full occupancy. We stayed in the hotel for our anniversary and the staff very kindly arranged a bottle of wine and truffles, which was a lovely surprise. Breakfast was delicious - especially the buttermilk pancakes. The hotel is slightly further out of the centre, which is the only reason we have rated it 4 stars. ",4,2023,09,12
206,Perfect ,"What a hotel,  my favourite in Dublin, beautiful room, love the dark bathroom, lovely spa and the rooftop bar is an experience all by itself. 
From start to finish the perfect Dublin escape, close to everything especially the theatre with a Witherspoon just at the front door 
I can't wait to go back ",5,2023,09,11
206,Do not skip breakfast!,"By far the most elegant hotel we stayed at in Dublin. Breakfast each day really made such a huge impact on the start of our day!

International plugs inside the room made it easy no matter where you were coming from. 

Elegant atmosphere and very posh in the best way!",5,2023,09,10
206,Bad service and not clean ,"Its not 5 star hotel service . And its not anantara i knew in UAE.
Room check in very late after 4 pm
Room not cleaned next day till 3.30 and when we come.back at night we found the used hand and face towels still the same and not changed. No coffee or nescafe in the room .
Pillows are yellow in color . Bad experience  . I stayed before 3 days in westbury dublin it was super in their service and amazing staff. ",1,2023,09,10
206,A Very disappointing experience to say the least,"Myself and friends experienced a very rude member of staff, when we enquired about a table for 6. A shame really, we like this place for pre-theatre drinks, we walked away in dismay. I doubt we will ever return. ",3,2023,09,10
206,"Excellent, comfortable hotel with an amazing breakfast and terrific location","What an excellent hotel!  Everything was so pristine, comfortable,  quiet.  Excellent service.  The breakfast was just amazing, among the best we have been offered worldwide.  It would be hard to find fault with this hotel;  everything was pretty much perfect.   Great location in the Docklands area, walking distance to Aviva stadium and close to the EPIC museum, easy access to Temple Bar. ",5,2023,09,04
206,Top-Shelf Experience,"The Marker was wonderful. The dining from breakfast, lunch and dinner all exceeded our expectations. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The bar had anything you could possibly want. And the staff was our favorite part of our stay. They are warm, welcoming and extremely attentive. It was a cab ride away from some of our activities but I would definitely return. ",5,2023,08,28
206,Perfection!,"Everything about the hotel was just wonderful.  From the first member of staff we met, who greeted us at the door before we even went inside, up to the end of our stay - every member of staff was a credit to the hotel.  I was so impressed with the cleanliness and quality of every part of the hotel, and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The buffet breakfast was the best I have ever had.  I especially recommend the Irish bread and butter pudding, their fresh juices and their mushrooms!  I would definitely stay here again.  ",5,2023,08,26
206,Super stylish hotel but kind of impractical,"A highly stylized and stylish hotel. The staff was amazing and the daily breakfast was one the highlights of our trip. The rooms were beautiful with tons of amenities like a heated towel rack if a little bit impractical. For example, the big beautiful sink bowl made it almost impossible to keep anything on the counter. There was no outlet in the bathroom and no mirror over the desk so I had to dry and curl my hair sitting on the floor by the front door. The room is lit by spotlights which makes putting on makeup a challenge. If you don‚Äôt need to do these things, you won‚Äôt notice the problems and can just enjoy the rain shower and the comfy bed and a/c. The most challenging thing was that while the neighborhood was neat, the hotel is about a 20 minute walk from most of the Dublin sights. We didn‚Äôt mind the extra exercise but had to built that into our sightseeing plans.",4,2023,08,24
206,Gem in Dublin,"I had a great time at the Anantara Marker. Very kind staff, great experience in the SPA. There is a price tag, but then you do get the royal treatment here. And I did not even experience the rooftop terrace due to my busy business trip. The swimming pool is very cool and so is the jacuzzi.",5,2023,08,21
206,The marker hotel,"We stayed in this hotel for an overnight stay in Dublin, the staff at this hotel were more than impressive and made our stay very memorable they were helpful and friendly from the moment we arrived until we left. The rooms are very modern with large flat screen TVs and large bathrooms which was perfect for young couple, I‚Äôd suggest visiting the spa facility‚Äôs during your stay as there‚Äôs a large pool, jacuzzi, sauna and a steam room complimentary with your room booking. ",5,2023,08,09
206,A welcome upgrade to an old favourite! ,"You're always a bit afraid when one of your favourite places is taken over, but in the case of the Anantara re-brand of The Marker, there's nothing to worry about and in fact lots to be excited for. The hotel decor has been given a subtle upgrade with the lobby, bar and restaurant all feeling refreshed without losing their original unique style. The bedrooms are still as spacious, quiet and comfy as ever, although the new decor in the room we stayed in was a little darker than I personally prefer. The breakfast and drinks still excellent, good to see Gareth Mullins still helming the kitchen! And the gym has had a welcome investment of some new equipment. The staff were all super professional and friendly as ever, although mostly new faces that I could see as it has been a year since my last visit. Kudos to The Marker and Anantara for investing in continuing to maintain 5 star standards! Can't wait to return. ",5,2023,08,05
206,Treat yourself!,"My wife and I met in Grand Canal Square 11 years ago having worked in restaurants opposite each other. We decided to treat ourselves to a night in the Marker Hotel and it was worth every penny. 

The service is attentive and professional, but still friendly and in no way stuffy. 

We would recommend you treat yourself to a massage if possible. The spa team are incredibly friendly and deliver on a soothing and relaxing experience. Special mention for both Marcia and Lorraina for the wonderful massages we received. 

The breakfast buffet is exquisite. My wife and I indulged (perhaps too much) on the fresh honeycomb that was available. We decided against a cooked breakfast but from what we saw they looked outstanding. Thank you to James for looking after us so well. 

The reception team and the concierge are all fantastic at what they do and went above and beyond where possible. Thank you to Elisabet and Benjamin for looking after us. ",5,2023,08,05

206,A hotel that worked exceptionally well - just a wonderful stay,"This is a hotel that you would be delighted to return to.

It is new - it is well located in the revived dockland area of Dublin - an area that you once avoided but has now been well and truly regenerated.

The hotel worked exceptionally well - I couldn't fault it on any major or minor point. The room was comfortable and very functional. The food was great - breakfast was about as good as you could get anywhere. The staff were friendly and just so willing to help. The location was excellent - right in the docklands but relatively close to the old sites in Dublin.

Would I return - absolutely !",5,2023,07,28

Already looking at booking for next month",5,2023,07,26
206,Good hotel," Very nice hotel with good
Location in Dublin, Ireland.
Hotel with a sauna/steam room
and  a pool. Unfortunately, they close the sauna/pool early so you really have to go in the afternoon verses the night after walking all day.
The theatre is right  across the street, although I noticed that there are set months when plays can be seen at this location.

206,Fantastic stay.,"Had a great 2 night stay. Service was 10/10. Breakfast was very tasty and lots of choice. Asked for vegetarian sausages and got them, nothing was ever too much trouble. Bedrooms were very clean, housekeeping were very good. Great location, 15-20 min walk to the centre but nice to come back and be away from the hustle and bustle. Spa was lovely and never too busy.",5,2023,07,21
206,Our breakaway,Absolutely stunning great part of town staff from the doorman were so friendly drinks were priced well when we went for a walk they gave us an umbrella and thought it was a nice touch will go again asap not for a lads weekend,5,2023,07,20
206,"Great location, food and staff","Great location, food and staff. Such wonderful staff make the experience 5 stars. The food is very good and the location was brilliant. We got to have drinks on the rooftop bar and the platters and cocktails were fab! Beds are very comfy too.",5,2023,07,12
206,Frustrating,"No WiFi in first room then no
Power in the second. Rang and told I would have to wait for techs before it could be fixed. Late for an important meeting and not a care from the hotel. Got another two days but would leave if I could. Not my first experience of bad service here. But on some of the occasions it has been great so balanced out. Frustrating today though. ",3,2023,07,10
206,Yet another amazing stay.,"We have been coming to this hotel now for 13 years.  This stay was just for one night.  It has been the first time we have been back at the hotel since Anantara brand took over The Marker hotel officially .  The changes made are amazing, especially with their new front door and signage.  Def gives you a sense of luxury and class before you even enter the hotel itself and is a talking point.  We were met by Benji who sorted out our luggage and took care of our car before entering the hotel to be greeted by Kenny who had water at the ready.  As we had arrived early our room was not ready and Lee, Grace and Rachel took great care of us as we had a bite to eat and a few beverages,  introduced to new members of staff, had a catch up with Derek (security) and not long after this we where informed our room was ready.  Kenny had already organised for our luggage to be brought to our room.  The rooms in this hotel are the best we have ever stayed in and always get a front facing room with amazing views. 

We then headed into the city for a bit of shopping.  As the weather was amazing we decided to come back to the hotel and make use of the rooftop bar.  A table had previously been reserved for us which we were very thankful for as it was extremely busy.  Again great to see a few familiar faces alongside new ones. 
We then headed back down to the bar area which was less busy and were able to relax and got a chance to speak with staff.  Here Rebecca, Diana and Dieago were on hand to sort us out with a few drinks.  We did enquire about food  in the bar as we were feeling a little peckish however was advised bar menu had stopped at 8pm but could get food in the restaurant.  This is something we did not follow up on..whilst the brassiere  menu looked amazing it was just a few snacks we were after. 
Can‚Äôt comment on turndown service as this was not provided during our stay. 
However a personal message and a lovely plate of macaroons has been left in our room alongside some other goodies. 

Breakfast the next morning was amazing.  We would honestly say The Marker breakfast has always been our favourite from all the hotels we have stayed in.  However this time breakfast is next level and the changes made are a talking point. We always love to see Conor who brings me my breakfast from the kitchen and takes the time to welcome us back and have a chat. 

We availed of a late check out which the team are always very accommodating with as we never want to leave as we are always so well treated and feel like part of the family. Iggy sorted us out with check out as there was a small issue but it was no problem.

Again Benji and Kenny assisted with luggage and getting the car which was filled with bottles of water for the journey home. 

Overall we would def recommend anyone to stay at this hotel.  It is a little pricy but is most definitely worth every penny.  Staff make you feel very welcome from the moment you arrive until you leave. 
Thanks again to Team Marker with special mention to Lee, Rachel, Rebecca, Grace, Benji, Kenny and Iggy who always go that wee bit further and of course to Derek for keeping us in craic with his jokes.
Can‚Äôt wait until our next stay already booked.

206,"If you are in Dublin, be here.","Dublin is an experience in itself. It's not that the city magnetically attracts a traveller, yet the city is special because the people are special. It's the same with this hotel. It looks a bit bulky from the outside, but the rooms are coherently decorated and the people are exceptionally helpful and friendly. Just like all the people in Dublin.",5,2023,07,07
206,Excellent Service ... Employees make it,Our air con unfortunately failed during our stay but the maintenance came during ungodly hours I think his name was GINO and he was a gentleman and I hope he got paid overtime for his services. Of all the hotels I stayed in previously I have never received such a prompt and curtious service. Thank you gino for such a prompt service . ,5,2023,07,04
206,Poor customer service,"Very poor experience. Service was extremely poor. Took an age to get served in the bar by reception, even if they had plenty of staff and it was not busy.  When I politely complained I was pointed to the door, which was very unprofessional and very bad business sense - considering in my party were American relatives who were residents of this hotel, 3 rooms for 2 nights at 500euro per room per night.  Very poor staff customer service. I can't imagine that ownership and senior management of the hotel would approve of this business performance. I'm proud of dublin, but not proud of how tourists are treated by some of our business owners - and this experience reiterated what I see regularly in the city. ",1,2023,06,30
206,Amazing relaxing wonderful hotel,"Beautiful hotel, great service, lovely breakfast buffet, nice pool even it's a bit small. They up graded my room free of charge because it was my birthday which was really kind of them. I will go again, had a great time.",5,2023,06,28
206,Modern functional hotel needs to work on a few things,"Nice modern functional 5 star hotel. Lacks a little character. 
Overall I had a good experience at the hotel. The place is in a good location and is a modern 5 star hotel. I had several colleagues staying there too and we all commented on how friendly the staff were. 
The spa is ok but the steam room wasn‚Äôt very hot. The sauna was better, the pool a good temperature but the spa area quite dark and busy as times.
Our main criticism was the slow service for drinks in the bar ( sometimes took an hour or so and twice we just gave up ) and restaurant. One of the mornings the breakfast area was so packed we had to wait half an hour for a table and then most of the buffet was finished. I asked for green tea and coffee from 5 different members of staff over the course of an hour and when it finally came it was ordinary black tea. Just little things like that are the reason I‚Äôve given it 4 stars",4,2023,06,28
206,Poor,"Room ready At 3pm ?- eh no 5-15pm
A complimentary drink at the bar took 25 minutes to arrive ! 
Room was still being cleaned when we finally got there.
Was told at check in , of fabulous upgrade  Eh no - sorry missus that was the room I booked.
30 minute wait in like for  breakfast both mornings  was like a hostel.
Oh and the roof top was unavailable to guests due to a private party. 

This was a poor 5 star experience 
Staff were run off their feet- shame on the management . 
We stayed here before ‚Ä¶things and ownet have changed
I would not recommend this hotel and it pains me to give a bad review .",1,2023,06,27
206,"Meh, Wasn‚Äôt amazing by any stretch.","Good: quick check in & out
Spa was lovely and relaxing, rooms where relaxing, good location.
Bad: worst breakfast service, 30e parking per night, roof top was closed. Nespresso machine kept over heating in room,could have done with a Kettle.
Overall handy for bord gais but probably wouldn‚Äôt stay again. ",3,2023,06,27
206,Amazing,"One of the best stays I‚Äôve had. Everything was perfect. From the moment we arrived, to the moment we left. It was full of a naturally eager to please attitude from all staff. 
Hotel is stunning, when we return there is only one place that I will be looking to stay. ",5,2023,06,27
206,Gorgeous Rooms but Disappointing Service,"My recent stay at The Marker Hotel in Dublin City left me with mixed feelings. While the hotel boasts beautiful rooms, stunning views, and a range of enticing amenities, the overall service fell short of my expectations.

To begin with, upon entering the room, I was disappointed to discover hairs on the toilet and a black seal in the shower that was hanging off. These cleanliness issues were unpleasant and tarnished my initial impression.

The breakfast experience was another letdown. I patiently waited for 30 minutes, only to be overlooked when it came to receiving tea or coffee. The buffet lacked plates, and the melon provided was disappointingly hard. It seemed that the buffet was not properly stocked, which was quite frustrating. Furthermore, despite requesting a newspaper, it was not provided.

Despite these setbacks, I must acknowledge the hotel's beautiful rooms, especially the corner suite. The lavish decor and the magnificent view of the grand canal dock in Dublin were truly memorable. The hotel also offers a range of desirable amenities, including a pool, rooftop bar, and engaging Dublin experience activities.

However, a significant drawback was the staff's poor English communication skills, both verbally and in written communication. It was challenging to effectively convey my needs and concerns, which led to unnecessary frustrations throughout my stay. On a positive note, I encountered a young man at the concierge desk who was very pleasant and provided excellent assistance.

Considering the issues I faced, I believe that the rate I paid for the hotel was excessively high for the level of service provided. While the rooms and amenities were impressive, the cleanliness issues, breakfast experience, and communication challenges with the staff significantly impacted my overall satisfaction.

In conclusion, if you prioritize luxurious rooms and a prime location, The Marker Hotel may still be worth considering. However, be prepared for potential disappointments in terms of cleanliness, breakfast service, and communication with the staff.",2,2023,06,25
206,Good but not as good as last time,My daughter and I stayed over Easter. Arrival was challenging- there is significant building work going on at the main entrance which was closed and it wasn‚Äôt immediately clear which door we were to use. Room was clean but bath was broken and as a consequence of that we had to move rooms halfway through stay but I felt the way it was handled was poor- there was not communication between maintenance and reception and I had to be the go- between. We are in the hotel and it was fine. Drinks on roof Terrance- again fine. Hotel is just missing some of the sparkle it had on pervious visit.,4,2023,06,25
206,Truly Wonderful Experience,"Warm welcome by all the staff which enhanced the overall ambiance of this hotel. Our room was a premium with a view overlooking the theatre and water front. We made full use of all the facilities and throughout our stay every request was completed politely and efficiently, a truly a wonderful experience!     ",5,2023,06,22
206,Wonderful stay at the Marker Dublin,"Had a business meeting at another 5 star hotel and we stayed a couple more nights after the meeting.  Other hotel had rooms twice the price because they were tightly booked up due to the conference.  We booked the Marker;  excellent decision, much better location, great service, beautiful accommodations, and great attention to detail.  At the 5 star level, both hotels exceeded the bar for quality staff but the Marker, in my opinion was nicer.",5,2023,06,21
206,Beautiful Hotel in a beautiful location,The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was very comfortable and clean. The roof top bar was very nice and relaxing.  The Brasserie served an excellent breakfast and we enjoyed having dinner there as well. We were able to walk to many of the sights we wanted to see. ,5,2023,06,21
206,Outstanding hotel with excellent breakfast,Modern hotel with outstanding concierge service and one of the very best hotel breakfast with top quality food ingredients . We stayed in a standard room that was very quiet and has all amenities that we needed. My only wish list would be more drawers in the room.,5,2023,06,19
206,Great choice for a modern hotel,"The service at the hotel was outstanding. All staff were friendly, attentive and professional. Special shout out for Grace, who was a delightful host working at breakfast. Good location ‚Äî an easy walk to most attractions and nice setting on the canal. ",5,2023,06,19
206,Another incredible property from the Anantara group!,"This is a stunning property, both inside and out. The spa area is one of the best city spa hotels I have ever encountered. The residents only rooftop bar is a great way to enjoy panoramic views of Dublin. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. If you are looking to be in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Dublin, this is not the place. If you are looking for something a little away from the hubbub (15-20 minute walk to the main area), I would not hesitate to book this hotel immediately!",5,2023,06,19
206,Great hotel with brilliant staff.,"If you want a five star hotel, in a perfect location, with spacious bedrooms and bathrooms in wall to wall luxury this is the place. Added to which the staff are welcoming, friendly and helpful - special mention to Graham (one of the excellent Concierge team) who went out of his way to help, support and advise us - an outstanding ambassador for the hotel.
Also, the breakfast was fantastic!
The hotel is ideally located for the city centre and is surrounded by really good restaurants.
Overall a five star hotel that really does live upto its rating. We can‚Äôt wait to return to this hotel in beautiful Dublin.",5,2023,06,17
206,Not enough time to enjoy!,"The Marker is a beautiful modern-style hotel. It is in a prime setting on the Liffey riverfront just south of the Temple Bar area of Dublin, the heart of the entertainment district. I wish we had more time to explore the amenitites of The Marker, but we were only able to stay for 5 hours since our flight out of Dublin had been cancelled and our next flight left at 4:30 a.m. We were able to enjoy the spacious bathroom and the luxurious rainfall shower! This was probably the most expensive hotel of our stay at ‚Ç¨635/night, and it's a shame we couldn't have stayed longer.",4,2023,06,16
206,The best hotel in Dublin,"It was a wonderful experience and I love to repeat it again. The staff did not put a foot wrong, always cheerful and so helpful. The rooms were spacious, especially for a twin which are often small, and the walk-in shower a great bonus. ",5,2023,06,09
206,"Great hotel, thoroughly recommend it for a special weekend away.","Stayed in this hotel for a special family event with our two small children. Check-in was excellent, fast and smooth, and the concierge delighted the children by giving them complimentary Haribo on arrival, so that was them won over. We had a welcome drink on the rooftop bar too.

Room was lovely and spacious; we had a corner room with a sofa bed. Great views over the docks to sit and look out in the evenings.

The rooftop bar was good and popular; we spent more time in the bar and lobby area downstairs (due to the hot sun when we were there) which is a nice area too. The drink selection is good (not too expensive) and the bar food was excellent too (again not as expensive as I expected it to be, and good portion sizes). Very skillful bar staff who can lean and pour drinks while balancing heavy trays - I was impressed.

The breakfast buffet was ideal - not too big a selection, just right, but everything they had was delicious and the hot food was cooked perfectly - the scrambled eggs and good thick bacon were never dry.

We spent a lot of time in the pool too. It's long and narrow, so good for people wanting to swim lengths, and it's a very cool, dark and atmospheric style with a roof light at one end.

All the staff were really helpful, friendly and welcoming. It's an expensive hotel but its setting is fantastic, it's in such a perfect location, and you're well looked after by the staff when you're there so it's worth it. I definitely recommend it for a special treat; it won't let you down!",5,2023,06,08
206,Great experience,The Anantara Marker Hotel was a wonderful hotel filled with many great staff members. They were all extremely helpful and friendly. They made our stay at the hotel accommodating and relaxing. I would definitely stay ther again if I am ever back in Dublin.,5,2023,06,05
206,Magnificent views and the best service!,"We visited the rooftop for a 50th Birthday and had such a wonderful experience. Rachel, the bar manager made us feel so welcome and was super accommodating. Would recommend for a special occasion. Views were the best in Dublin City. Thank you for making the occasion extra special!",5,2023,06,04
206,Incredible ! Take a Bow!,"Probably the best customer service experience I have experienced. My daughter stayed at this hotel and was hugely impressed. But after checking out she lost all her cash, cards, passport and phone. She returned to the hotel stranded where I had sent her boarding pass. 
Derek went way beyond what we expected to help. Many obstacles were encountered trying to repatriate but he refused to give up until passsport was located and retrieved, airport transfer organised and additional care too lengthy to list. A lesson to any in crisis management and customer care. His empathy towards the situaton was incredible.
He even phoned with a ""wrap-up"" once all was done and my daughter safely on her way home.
I truly have never experienced anything as impresive as this master class in care. We are already planning our break to the Marker
  
     ",5,2023,06,02
206,Best hotel In Dublin,Everything was perfect could not recommend it enough. Staff were amazing hotel was spotless facilities were second to none. I booked the hotel as a surprise for my fianc√©‚Äôs birthday so was a bit nervous hoping it would be good.  I shouldn‚Äôt have been. Definitely stay again and definitely got plenty of brownie points!!!,5,2023,05,31
206,"Nice hotel. Bad reservations and front desk‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.,..,,,..,.,,",I had left a card on file to cover breakfast charge for my clients who I had booked 2 rooms for. I communicated multiple times not to discuss payment with them and charge me in stead. Yet they still would not let clients leave until they had paid for breakfast.,2,2023,05,30
206,Not five star,"Stayed overnight in The Marker. Housekeeping staff were lovely, the room was absolutely spotless. The pool area was very nice, clean, very relaxing. The concierge guy/doorman was very helpful. We ate in the restaurant for dinner and the food was beautiful. 

However, there seems to be a lack of customer service in the hotel. 

Service in the restaurant was quite slow. We spent an inordinate amount of time waiting; waiting for someone to take our order, waiting for drinks, waiting for plates to be cleared etc. The two servers looking after the section of the restaurant we were sitting in were very good but they were extremely busy. There seemed to be two Ma√Ætre D' staff on duty, they were quite unaware of what was going on, they didn't manage the restaurant very well, it would have been great if they could have helped out the other staff. We spoke to one of the receptionists about the issue and he very rudely interrupted me as I was explaining the situation. 

The security guard at the rooftop bar was quite abrupt.

I was purchasing a product in the spa and while the therapist was getting the product, she attended to three other customers who arrived after me and left me standing waiting. 

Overall, the customer service could have been a lot better, it definitely was not five star. There's some basics missing; a lack of courtesy. 

It's very disappointing, especially as there were lots of positive points about our stay. However, as a result of the customer service, we wouldn't stay again.",3,2023,05,28
206,The best hotel in Dublin,loved it - outstanding service with a smile from all staff members - great pool - great bar - great breakfast - will have to come back to enjoy/experience the roof top bar which is open only in the weekends ,5,2023,05,25
206,Plan not to stay again,"When the hotel and #Agoda say ‚ÄúCity Center‚Äù, I say it is located in the center of newly developed or extended city. Look well how far the places you want to go to and from the hotel. Otherwise, real five star in the real center can cost the same as this hotel room plus transport fare each day. 

To go to closest corner of the places I need to visit or shopping on weekends is at least more than 1 kilometer. 

Most staff are kind. But the minibar checker staff:
The sign at Mini bar said one thing (see picture) but the bar checker knocked the door #impolitely I said I didn‚Äôt consume anything but he push the door, saying I need to check, even I stood against the door. He came in straight to the fridge door, opened and closed and left; not even look at snacks bar; not saying thank you for cooperation nor apologized for any inconvenience. #remove the sign and train the staff to #workbetter 

The room gives sense on nowhere. Not very comfortable, nothing to feel impressed. The doors bang very noisy every time day and night when housekeeping works near by or guests leave the doors closed carelessly. Water pressure in shower room is poor and the size of the shower room is smaller or much smaller than usual. 

Water in the Pool is totally unclear. 
Bad or uncared changing area. 

Plan not to return",3,2023,05,22
206,THE MARKER ,Went to the marker for lunch yesterday. The staff were friendly and helpful. The food was very nice. The service was quick and efficient. The decor of the foyer and restaurant was lovely. The wheelchair access was great. ,4,2023,05,21
206,Anniversary stay,"My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary and had an amazing time. The room was excellent and the hotel staff were so friendly & welcoming. We didn't try the restaurant but the rooftop bar is fantastic - very nice cocktails with a great view of Dublin.
We are sincerely grateful for making our stay special, thank you!",5,2023,05,17
206,Nice hotel with beautiful spa services and super comfortable beds!,Very nice upscale hotel on the edge of town in Dublin.  I liked most everything about the hotel and chose it because if offered spa services.  The beds and linens with a lightweight comforter were amazingly comfortable.  It is a bit far from the heart of Dublin so it took a solid 15 -20 minutes to walk to pubs and restaurants in the main part of town.  ,5,2023,05,10
206,Average food,Popped into the bar area on Sunday before a concert. Ordered Burger and some sides. Took a long time to arrive. Presentation was nice but for 25 euro Burger was pretty tasteless. Definately not worth that money.,2,2023,05,10
206,Great spot for pre show food,Decided to dine here on a Saturday night before going to a show in an bord gais theatre. Parked nearby. We were served quickly and food was of high quality. Lovely service and atmosphere. Well done to all involved. Not too expensive either. Excited to return.,5,2023,05,07
206,Just superb!,"Superb hotel in every way. 
Would not hesitate to recommend this first class hotel with everything more than meeting our needs from the rooms, to the service with the rooftop bar a real bonus. 
Luxurious with first class staff. Now installed as my go to Dublin hotel. ",5,2023,05,07
206,One night for the price of two!!!,"Booked on the GHA discovery app. Received no pre-arrival emails or personalized upcoming stay reminders. As a result I showed up day after my reservation. I received no refund, just a discounted rate for my stay and a fake smile. (nothing in my spam box either....I checked)",1,2023,05,05
206,Wedding,From start to finish it was an exceptional time. The staff make it they are so friendly and efficient. Food at the wedding was incredible and the chef met us all. The rooftop bar is a must see. Ideal location,5,2023,05,04
206,"Fabulous bathroom, spacious bedroom","Comfortable hotel. Slow service in roof terrace and breakfast and at checkout marred the experience.
Waited 15 minutes for a bowl of olives in roof terrace bar and they didn‚Äôt have a cocktail stick to eat them with! Gluten-free free choice at breakfast poor.",4,2023,05,04
206,Dublin weekend,"Great location just outside the city. Breakfast was excellent, bread and butter pudding at breakfast was genius! My only real negative was the price of the drinks in the bar‚Ä¶ top dollar and more‚Ä¶ Hard not to pay a visit to the Wetherspoons next door at a fraction of the cost.",4,2023,05,03
206,Perfection,The staff Will make you feel like royalty and the food is exquisite all this in a modern themed hotel. The rooftop bar offer a view overlooking the city wich is very nice. On and all i really enjoyed my stay at the Marker ,5,2023,05,03
206,Great if you are not gluten free,"Lovely hotel opposite the theatre . Comfortable room and superb bathroom.  Nice breakfast spread, but gluten free limited to toast.

Just around the corner from the river Liffey, great for taxis.
Will be going back.",5,2023,04,27
206,The place to stay in Dublin,Ideal location - safe area. High quality hotel that sets a standard. Easy walk to Shelbourne Park greyhounds - or the other way into the city. Spa is world class - take your time and savour. Rooftop bar an experience all of its own.,5,2023,04,26
206,The best hotel experience in Dublin,"The Marker Hotel goes to every lengths to make your stay at this hotel the best experience and the most comfortable.

206,Simply Abu Dhabi,"The hotel itself was outstanding and beautiful. The staff, every single member was extremely helpful and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. The spa was absolutely stunning and relaxing. Highly recommended!!!!",5,2023,04,17
206,Staying in Dublin,"We visit Dublin regular to visit friends and family so often only stay for a night or two and this hotel was perfect for us. After picking up our hire car and arriving at the hotel the valet service took it and parked it for us and brought our bags to the room for us.

The lounge area was clean, stylish and had lovely cocktails! The room was very spacious and modern and had good facilities! 

We had drinks up on the rooftop before heading out to dinner and even though it was raining it was still nice to experience! 

The only negative I would say is that we arrived at 2.40pm and were told check in is at 3pm so to go and wait. Whilst we understand we were 20minutes early it seems ridiculous they couldn‚Äôt check whether our room was ready and if so let us know 20mins before check in. I‚Äôve stayed at many exclusive hotels over the years and this is the first time I was told me we needed to wait. I would understand if they had told us the room wasn‚Äôt ready but it appeared the room hadn‚Äôt even been checked we were told to wait just because it was before 3pm.",5,2023,04,17
206,Excellent hotel,"This is our third visit to the marker hotel. Located in a very comfortable location, rooms and public areas of the hotel. A very helpful crew, perfect and rich breakfast, makes our stay great. I recommend to make more place for clothes",5,2023,04,14
206,A long way to go to create a 5 star atmosphere.,"We have stayed a few 5 star hotels but this one was far from 5 star.  We encountered a mixed atmosphere from staff with some very good and others quite rude.  A good business hotel at best, there is a lot of work to bring it to 5 star level.  It lacked coordination from a manager in both bars making long wait for food orders that the on duty manager ended up comping a lot of guests drinks. Again a long wait for breakfast it seemed no manager was orchestrating the staff. The card machines were down on check out.  You should be able to settle your bill from your room as in other 5 stars. Also restricting the pool for children is understandable from a certain time but we wanted to take our 7 month old in for 10 minutes and we told the policy is strict..we went down at 4.55 and nothing was said to us. A certain level of common sense was missing",2,2023,04,13
206,Weekend Stay,"Lovely hotel and facilities. Suitable for short and long stays. Staff friendly and helpful and look to go above and beyond. 
Make use of the spa facilities.
Slight walk into the town centre for restaurants and bars.",4,2023,04,13
206,Incredible hospitality and pet-friendliness,"Great hospitality! We were staying with cats, and all were so attentive. In our room there was even a complimentary litterbox and bowls for cats -- it was so pleasant at night after a long trip, we appreciated it a lot.
Rooms are beautifully designed, with nice flooring and large comfortable bed. It also was great to have separate bath and shower in a big bathroom. Breakfast was pleasure as well with a large selection of fresh products. Unfortunately we didn't have time to attend spa zone -- I'm sure it would be great too.
It was our best experience not only during this diffucult trip with cats, but in general. The hotel is really worth its price. 
Thank you Anantara for great experience! Hope we will be back once!",5,2023,04,11
206,A hidden gem,"Could not fault a thing about this hotel. Beautiful rooms, luxurious and spacious, amazingly clean and beautiful atmosphere. The breakfast was the best quality I have ever had, the chefs are brilliant. All of the hotel staff make you feel looked after and at ease, nothing is too much from the moment you arrive. ",5,2023,04,10
206,Far from a 5 star hotel,"Had a 2 night stay here with my Wife and Baby (8 months). Unfortunately from check In our experience was pretty poor, the receptionist immediately handed me a sheet stating when and where we couldn‚Äôt go with our son. We were both looking forward to taking him for his first swim only to be told the cutoff was less than an hour after we checked in and there were no exceptions or flexibility. That night we dined in the bar and although things didn‚Äôt go smoothly with the service the manager was really nice and even comped a round of drinks and they heated up baby food for us too so no complaints there. The food was very nice too and the bar has a nice setting. The second night we were out all day and decided to have dinner in the room. I popped down to the bar to ask again for the food to be warmed up for baby and get a drink, this wasn‚Äôt well received and the barman I was speaking too wasn‚Äôt to nice about it. It‚Äôs only heating up a bowl in a microwave behind the bar for 2 mins, thought this would be easy for a 5 star hotel. Next morning breakfast was okay but took 45 mins to get the order. 
To sum up, it‚Äôs a nice hotel in a great location and they have some excellent staff but unfortunately most of the staff seem to be untrained in the hospitality sector. Expect a hit and miss experience. 
One point to note, parking is 30 euro a day but the valets are actually the nicest people working at the hotel and have really good tips for eating out so it‚Äôs well worth it. ",2,2023,04,10

206,Modern and great location ,"
It's a lovely hotel, though it feels more like a corporate office than a hotel. The rooms are lovely and spacious and my room is on the 5th floor facing the main entrance.

Breakfast is a typical Irish or English breakfast and continental breakfast.

Staff are attentive and very friendly. Receptionists are always attentive and the hotel is in a great location which can be accessible by walking or getting a cab.

Will definitely come back again.",5,2023,04,09

The rooms were comfy, and we chose a room with a ""view"" - which was a great choice (overlooking the canals). The bed was comfy. We also spent some time in the spa and gym.

The staff always greeted us and would try their best to accommodate our requests and make our stay comfortable.  WIFI connection was a bit weak during our stay which we understand was due to the recent renovation, but the staff really went extra miles to fix the problem.  Breakfast at the hotel was marvellous as always!  Would definitely recommend The Marker to anyone staying at Dublin.",5,2023,03,28
206,Not great.,"Upon arrival I brought cash to pay for my stay along with bank cards & identification, I was told they needed another 250 cash on top of an already 400 priced room. When talking to the front desk I was told it was pay the 250 deposit or they would not let me stay. Also very slow wait on the rooftop bar for 2 drinks (20 mins) while the bar was not particularly busy.",2,2023,03,28
206,Great hotel,A lovely place to stay. Service was excellent. Hotel was clean and they provide a turn down service which is a nice touch! Don‚Äôt wear the slippers the hotel provide beside the pool as it‚Äôs like walking on ice. All staff very friendly! Kenneth the concierge was very attentive and an older gentleman Derrick I think his name was gave us champagne on the sat afternoon. Would return in a heartbeat! ,5,2023,03,28
206,Superb Dublin Hotel,"lovely located modern hotel with all top facilities available for business or pleasure trips. staff are friendly and accomodating, choice of restaurants excellent. spa with massages available, gym & pool a welcome relaxation treat",5,2023,03,28
206,Great Hotel,Lovely hotel with friendly staff. Definitely stay there again. Great spa facilities. Very good breakfast. Made to feel welcome the moment we checked in. The location is just about right to walk to the bars and restaurants of Temple Bar.,5,2023,03,28
206,Brilliant,"Thoroughly enjoyed a 2 night stay with my wife and friends.  The staff are very friendly, professional and attentive.  The rooms are large, clean and very quiet.  The breakfast was amazing.  So much variety on offer.  We used the Spa and Swimming Pool 3 times which was enjoyed by everyone.  The only negatives were that we were questioned about using a toy in the pool for a new born baby but was actually a safety device.  We nearly slipped at the side of the swimming pool as well.  Better signage to remove slippers provided by the hotel or provide slip proof slippers would help.  The concierge/front door staff were so helpful and friendly.  We were offered complimentary Guinness, Champagne and water during our visit.  The staff also provided us with umbrellas.   Best Pillows ever!!!",5,2023,03,27
206,Quality hotel and a great stay ,"I‚Äôve stayed here many times and it‚Äôs always a great stay. The staff are so welcoming and friendly and the rooms are super comfortable and very quiet. The bar and staff are lovely - great cocktails! The breakfast is also really worth getting. We also appreciated the way the staff dealt with a couple of small issues we had with wifi and the tv in our room - Ignacio at reception was quick to rectify these and was really helpful and we also really appreciated Derek, the manager, coming to speak to us directly. It‚Äôs these touches that make the marker such a great place to stay - also really well placed for seeing Dublin without being right in the throng of it all and having a little haven away from the madness! We‚Äôd absolutely stay again",5,2023,03,25
206,Incredible stay!,"Everything about our stay from start to finish was incredible. From check in to check out. Our room was great, love the heated bathroom floor! The rooftop bar and hotel bar were lovely. We highly recommend The Marker. ",5,2023,03,24
206,Overpriced and unaccommodating.,Save your money nothing special about this hotel.  Stayed another evening in Dublin for more than half the price and better service.  Not sure what the hype is for this hotel.  Unimpressed.  Didn‚Äôt even include breakfast for $500 a night what a joke,2,2023,03,23
206,5 Star Staff,"The hotel is as expected - a great lcoation, well appointed common areas and the rooms are well maintained and comfortable.   The real 5 star element is the quality of the staff.  All the staff we encountered were professionla, friendly and proficient.   ",5,2023,03,22
206,Luxurious hotel a bit far from the major attractions,"This was a great hotel. The service was excellent. My flight arrived quite early in the day and they were able to store my bags and then get me checked in early. The rooms are large and luxurious. There is a switch that allows you to heat the bathroom floors. I was there at an incredibly busy time and it was very quiet, which is important for me because I'm a light sleeper. The two things I would warn people about are the internet, which was great in the lobby and bar, but intermittent in my room, and the location. It is a quiet location with several restaurants and pubs very near by. There are also mini marts a short walk away. However, it is quiet a distance from some of the major attractions. It is over two miles to the Guinness Storehouse. As long as you don't mind a lot of walking or taxis, then the location isn't an issue. If you want to be in the thick of things, this hotel is a bit further removed.",4,2023,03,21
206,Spot on,"Concierge are outstanding and can‚Äôt do enough for you. 
Breakfast slightly expensive but on the other hand really good
Rooms are really clean 
Slightly out of the centre but a nice walk nonetheless 

Worth every penny ",5,2023,03,14
206,Very comfortable hotel.,"The hotel located in a very good area where walking around is easy and smooth.
The food and services are excellent and up to high standards.
Just be aware of any work going on during your stay.
The management are friendly and equipped.",4,2023,03,13
206,Lovely hotel with super staff,"Stayed here for 3 nights to visit the city, really nice hotel and would highly recommend. Lovely welcome from Juan on reception, room was immaculately clean and very comfortable. Drinks and food in the bar where we were very well looked after by Rachel, who is a superstar. I‚Äôd also recommend a visit to the roof top bar if you get a chance. Lovely walk along the river into the city centre. I‚Äôm aware the hotel is having some works carried out but we didn‚Äôt notice it all and it made no impact on our visit. All of the staff team seem very committed to doing everything they can and we‚Äôd definitely visit again.",5,2023,03,12
206,nice hotel,"if you stay at this hotel avoid breakfast, otherwise good but not excellent, very polite reception, nice rooms, the pool could have been cleaner.. the restaurant was under construction when we stayed which could have caused some of the inconvenience, but even the drinks for the roof top bar came from the underground kitchen.. no taps open, also inconvenient and very slow.",4,2023,03,10
206,True 5 star!,"The Marker is a fabulous hotel, with fabulous staff. We thoroughly enjoyed 2 nights there, especially the breakfasts and the spa treatments. There is a lovely pool and well equipped gym. We were lucky to have had breakfast on the second day in the new Brasserie restaurant, congratulations to Lee and his team for this very impressive fine dining area. All the staff in the hotel were well trained and very welcoming. 
I'd thoroughly recommend the Marker to anyone visiting Dublin",5,2023,03,09
206,Brilliant except for the TV remote,Newly refurbished.  Very nice indeed all round.  Extremely helpful staff.  Restaurant was closed for renovation (it's open again now) but a good alternative location used.  They are proud of their new smart TVs but I couldn't get it to work properly.  The remote is one of those super-clever ones which you can't actually work out how to operate.,5,2023,03,09
206,Wonderful experience,"The hotel impressed me more than I expected, first time in a 5 star and it set the bar. From entering the hotel and the bags being brought up to the room, to the view we had in our room and the interior design in the room was perfect and the book with all the top hotels was a nice touch for light reading.",5,2023,03,06
206,Business Hotel that needs to fix the WIFI,"Great hotel, extremely friendly and helpful staff and overall great atmosphere. They currently seem to be having issues with their WIFI and are doing some restaurant renovations, other than that it's a great hotel for a business trip (or leisure, if you have the money). ",5,2023,03,03
206,Superb,"Fantastic hotel in every way. Everything here from the minute you arrive till the moment you‚Äôre leaving you just couldn‚Äôt fault anything. Excellent service, food, bed, cocktails and everything between.",5,2023,03,03
206,Girls weekend away,Trip to Dublin group of girls  fantastic location. Super impressive on entry. Staff extremely helpful and nothing was a probably. Rooms spacious and clean ‚Ä¶beds sensational‚Ä¶bathroom was gorgeous with lovely amenities. Loved every bit of our stay. No complaints at all!!!,5,2023,03,03
206,Modern Charm,"The hotel sits near the docks and by the financial district but it is just steps away from the river, pubs, a college and sights. We enjoyed retreating to the modern amenities of the hotel at the end of the night. The bar was open and served snacks and desserts (because the restaurant was under construction). The staff was attentive and helpful and the rooms were spacious and beautiful.",5,2023,02,28
206,Hotel in decline,"While booking the hotel room I checked prices online before calling. I was quoted a much higher price over the phone so I said I would think about it as remembered the price being cheaper online. After confirming the cheaper price online I phoned again. Same story quoting me a higher price, when I pointed out the cheaper price online I was told ‚Äòoh yea‚Äô!
When I got the booking confirmation email I got another new price, after more emails I and another new price I booked. We have stayed multiple times in the past and had a voucher for this stay, which I provided during the email booking, only to be told at check in I needed the physical voucher and would have to go home and get it. I explained I had provided this during booking and was told it was redeemed and what the balance was. Receptionist simply stated it was hotel policy but would phone to room to confirm if I needed to get the voucher. No phone call, 2 emails later, I phoned and was told it was ok but not to try using the redeemed voucher! Left such a bad taste the whole experience and was terribly managed.",2,2023,02,27
206,Fantastic stay in The Marker,"Lovely hotel but the staff are what make it a fantastic experience, so attentive & helpful. A special mention to Graham for organising taxi's etc for us, an absolute gentleman, nothing was too much bother! Loved the rooftop bar with the great views of the city, all in all a great stay!",5,2023,02,25
206,5 Star Hotel?,"Not really sure this hotel is 5 Star quality, no comparison between Merrion Hotel, Westbury Hotel and Sherborne - miles apart! I really feel staff should undergo a training programme in customer relations ",4,2023,02,20
206,Very noisy.,"The noise was deafening with the building work going on. I asked for a quiet room and the noise was never mentioned. It stared at 8.30am and kept going as i was checking out. The guest relations manager apologised and asked me to contact her the next time I was booking the hotel, Sadly I don't think there will be a next time.",2,2023,02,14
206,INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE,"The Marker is undoubtedly one of the best hotels I‚Äôve ever stayed in. Its outstanding facilities and, above all, its extraordinary and professional staff made our stay memorable. Big thanks to all of them!!!",5,2023,02,09
206,Beautiful hotel let down by room service & WiFi quality,"Food and cocktails from the Marker Bar were lovely, room service club sandwich was terrible considering the cost. Rooms are gorgeous and very clean, hotel in general is gorgeous. Staff were friendly but if you order your own takeaway be sure to wait downstairs as they don‚Äôt accept or call you if your food has arrived, even if that was arranged by reception. Rooftop bar was open when we stayed but only a small area was open as a member of staff politely told us when we tried to take a photo as we left. The hotel is in a brilliant location, walking distance to retail shops and it has plenty of lovely restaurants right beside it. The WiFi of tv wasn‚Äôt working until the evening of our second night stay and when the WiFi was fixed it wasn‚Äôt great.",2,2023,02,06
206,A good contemporary style hotel,"As a LHW club member, my preference typically tends to be for Leading Hotels whenever they are available, as they are usually reliable and of a certain standard so make for less of a gamble. Having previously stayed at The Merrion, which was a disaster from start to finish (see separate review), we thought that we'd try somewhere that had been refurbished (or in the Marker's case, built) in the current century.

The slightly out of the centre location - a brisk 15 - 20 minute walk to Temple Bar - appealed to us, and indeed as is usually the case, we discovered new places and areas to explore enroute. If you need to get anywhere in a hurry, the centre is a very short taxi ride away. In short, the location for us was every bit as good, if not better than the more traditional city centre hotels.

The hotel itself is architecturally distinctive with a large cantilever bridge structure meaning the whole lobby and restaurant area is open plan with no columns to interrupt the flow. The room was spacious and had a pleasant water view. That said, there were plenty of signs of wear and tear, so on closer inspection certain areas looked a bit tired and in need of a refresh, although not as tired as some other properties. Despite this, the room was very comfortable, and the Irish brand toiletries were a nice touch to keep things local.

The spa and pool area were particularly large for a city centre hotel, although despite this, felt very busy on both occasions when we used them. The pool area needs a rethink in terms of having more smaller chairs, as on one occasion we had to hang our towels as all of the chairs/loungers were occupied. The water machine by the pool was broken and the jug that was used as an alternative had not been topped on on either day that we were there. It feels with some small tweaks this whole space could work much more effectively.

We enjoyed breakfast in the restaurant each morning which comprised a wide array of high quality produce, including many local items, as well as numerous dishes that one could order a la carte. The service was good and the setting was comfortable.

Overall, The Marker offers a high quality product, but if it wants to stay on top then they need to focus on some of the finer details that are the hallmark of deluxe hotels. All in all we enjoyed our stay and are planning to return on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2023,01,29
206,The Marker - perfect for business trips,"I came to Dublin for a business trip. The location and facilities were great. Connectivity could have been better, but despite that - it was a pleasure and I highly recommend it despite the high price",5,2023,01,26
206,Poor overall,"With booking the rooms at this price point I expected much better, to be greeted with building work and a closed bar area is disappointing however to have building work next to your rooms with no warning is unacceptable. Also staff informing do not disturb signs I find daily rude as despite myself and my colleagues only staying 2 days my sign was ignored on multiple occasions with staff even asking to come into my room to deliver crisps for the mini bar.",2,2023,01,23
206,A great place to stay if the location suits,"In the docklands and not the town centre so not ideal for everyone but the hotel is fantastic. Great spa, nice rooms and two nice bars. Breakfast there is also highly recommended. A great destination hotel!",5,2023,01,19
206,4 star instead of 5,"Felt bar was understaffed‚Ä¶asked 3 times for a glass of water, overheard another member of staff laugh about a guest‚Ä¶wasn‚Äôt child friendly even though on check in had to fill in details of child and ask about a drink of choice‚Ä¶nothing ever came of that ",4,2023,01,09
206,Building work - avoid !!,"Extremely loud noice from building works on-site. 
No pre-warning to advise of current works yet table was booked weeks in advance.
Asked numerous times when works would stop and was told 20 minutes each time. 2 hours into our meal - the noise is still overwhelming! avoid the Brassiere at all costs at the minute ‚Ä¶ surely a hotel of this calibre could move the restaurant to more appropriate space until works are finished, or at least give patrons notice of the disruption!

206,50th Birthday Treat. ,"A most excellent 2-night stay in a part of the city unfamiliar to most people visiting.
Couldn't fault the exemplary service from the friendly staff, and was more than satisfied with the facilities offered too. Thanks particularly to Silas for the welcome and to Derek for the impromptu tour from the rooftop. ",4,2023,01,05
206,Lovely trip,"Had a lovely trip, staff were super friendly and welcoming. The hotel is lovely! The bedrooms are not what I would expect from a 5* as they were basic but bathrooms are lovely. The spa was nice to use but also quite basic. The rooftop bar was busy in the evening and quite difficult to get somewhere to sit inside especially as it was so cold. The location is quite a bit away from everything central, so its around ‚Ç¨10-14 into areas like Temple Bar/Guinness Factory etc. Overall a lovely hotel, bit overpriced for what it was but the staff make it worth it",4,2023,01,05
206,Review,"See previous notes, poor experience being asked to share the table we had with another far larger group, this made us uncomfortable and we ended up leaving the table and had to sit in the rain due to that being the last sheltered table. breakfast was cold the next day and had to ask multiple times for our drinks order.

206,Amazing hotel,"Fabulous stay recently while attending a concert Nearby , from checkin to when we left this hotel is amazing . Room was spotless , lovely  & so comfortable .

206,Must stay at the Marker!,"From the moment we arrived until we departed it was an exceptional experience. All of our needs, and some are odd, were accommodated with grace. The staff is simply incredible and work to ensure your happiness. 
The restaurant, for dinner, was also a treat. My husband and I shared the beef and Beaujolais meal that was wonderful.
From the Dublin we traveled to the coast 3.5 hikes away. Rachel, from the front desk packed us 2 bags of snacks for our journey.",5,2022,12,27
206,A lovely treat,"An extremely pleasant visit . We decided to visit The Marker as part of a Christmas trip to Dublin to see Beauty and the Beast. We ordered food and drinks. The wait for food was a little long but not long enough to complain. Without a word said the maitre d  apologised and offered to look after us. 
We will be visiting again and would highly recommend. 
Little extra touches by the maitre d and staff, talking to our daughter made for a very enjoyable visit.

206,Top class,Highly recommend this hotel. Best one I have stayed at. Staff are awesome from the moment you arrive in the car. Great location. We had a couples massage which was lovely. Good gym and swimming pool..,5,2022,12,21
206,Amazing experience!,"We had our business Christmas Party at The Marker this Dec and it was an absolute pleasure working with everyone involved.
The entire process was super easy and clear. Devon was always prompt to respond to our questions via email and made sure all our requests were accommodated. A special praise goes to the team that worked with us on the day, with a special mention to Stephen who was leading the team. 
Stephen made sure we were on schedule, that everyone was happy with the service and was always prompt to check if we needed anything else from the team who were all extremely friendly and helpful. Top service!
Super recommend.",5,2022,12,20

206,Lovely hotel - great stay,Our stay was a gift from our children and it was a great experience. The staff without exception were all so friendly and helpful. Special thanks to Inez in Reservations. You are incredible. The interior is lovely. Our room was perfect  - very comfortable bed too. We had drinks in the Marker bar- the Mojito Royale was delicious! Lovely food and an exceptional breakfast in the Brassiere restaurant and that includes the delicious chocolate milkshake made especially for the hubby. Thanks for everything. ,5,2022,12,07
206,Great hotel don‚Äôt miss out,"This Hotel is the best in Dublin, l would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for something special, it caters for everyone needs with great staff great location, it‚Äôs a truly great experience without worrying about safety some hotels in town cater for booze weekends this one is more refined and so much more of an experience in quality.",5,2022,12,01
206,Fabulous,"Excellent location, with beautiful rooms a fab pool and friendly staff 

The roof top bar (although closed at the moment) offers fabulous views over the south side of Dublin 

Valet parking is a added bonus ",5,2022,11,29
206,Spacious & Relaxing,"I really enjoyed my stay at this luxury hotel.  My room was on the 2nd floor, and I did not hear any noise from the hallway or neighboring rooms.  The pillowtop bed was amazingly comfortable.  The bathroom was spacious.  It had a shower stall separate from the bathtub.  The heated marble flooring was a nice touch!  The room had floor to ceiling windows and felt very open.  The room comes with a fridge stocked with drinks and snacks.  On day 1, I called the front desk to remove all of the drinks and snacks from my room so that I could make room for the items that I purchased on my own.  Someone came up to the room promptly with an empty basket, and removed all of the minibar items.  When I went to check out, the front desk person said that I consumed 1 bag of M&Ms.  I replied that I didn't and that I specifically asked for all minibar items to be removed from my room.  He took off the charge for the M&Ms and I left the hotel.  A day or so later, I received an email from the hotel stating that I consumed literally every single item at the minibar and asked what card they can charge for it.  Again, I explained that I had the minibar items removed from my room as to not be charged for them and to make room for my own items.  There was a bit of back and forth, but ultimately, my card was not charged.  There was some miscommunication with their staff.  Other than that little mishap, this was a fantastic stay.",4,2022,11,28
206,Pricy and will be looking for value next time,"Having stayed here before I was keen to come back and experience the Marker again - 
One thing that I noted that the staff were stiff perhaps overtrained on rules - Rooms were as what you expected could have done with a painting and a little bland . Breakfast was good but they could have done with a number of other staff as tables were slow to be cleared , it‚Äôs impossible situation for them currently 

We sat in the lobby for drinks and it‚Äôs was clear that there were a family of kids there before us there were crayons everywhere on the floor and despite the stiffness of the young staff member she did bother to clear them and other staff around her

Overall I found it good - seriously pricy and perhaps you could get better value elsewhere which I will be going for next time",3,2022,11,27
206,Beautiful 5 Star Hotel,Amazing hotel . Totally deserves 5 Star status . Staff can‚Äôt do enough for you . Lovely location . Turn down service adds that touch of class . Didn‚Äôt have food but beautiful roof top bar well worth a visit. Definitely worth a visit . Will be back again,5,2022,11,26

206,Just awesome!!,"We absolutely enjoyed our stay at The Marker. The hotel is close to all sorts of shopping and dining locations via a short drive (approximately 10-15minutes). There are also dining, pubs, and stores just a walking distance away, not to mention the fabulous bar, restaurant and the room service at the hotel. The hotel is immaculately clean and we could not ask for a genuinely nicer and more professional staff. They treated us like royalties from the moment we walked in until the last day of our stay. The spa services are also phenomenal. They are all indoor so we were able to enjoy the pool, the steam room and the hot-tub in November and they are very well maintained and super clean. We definitely look forward to going back and highly recommend it to everyone.    ",5,2022,11,23
206,Excellent!,The hotel is very nice but it was the friendliness and professionalism of the staff that was the outstanding feature throughout all areas of the hotel. The best I have ever encountered! Room quiet and really good size. Roll away bed could have been improved upon. Not really suitable for adult use. ( Only negative!),5,2022,11,22
206,Nice Hotel,"Had a great time while staying at the Marker. We arrived very early in the morning around 5:45 am we were told there weren't any available rooms however the front desk made sure we were comfortable; we had breakfast in the bar area while we waited on the spa to open at 7 am. We freshened up in the spa area and then stored our luggage with the hotel, they called us a taxi and we headed off to meet the 9 am tour we scheduled before arriving. When we came back from the tour the room and luggage were ready and waiting on us. The 24hr room service was a nice feature for late-night drinks and food.",5,2022,11,20
206,Do yourself a favor - don‚Äôt stay here,"We stayed at The Marker for a week recently. There are numerous issues with this hotel and I cannot recommend it. First, its location is only workable if you are in Dublin to do business with one of the tech companies located within walking distance. Getting to any other part of Dublin is difficult. It is located in a ‚Äúpublic transportation black hole,‚Äù as my husband and I came to call it. The C1, C2 and C3 bus stop is fairly nearby, but those buses don‚Äôt take you near any parts of central Dublin that would interest tourists. You‚Äôll have to change to another bus. Likewise, the DART and LUAS are a fair walk",2,2022,11,18
206,Disappointing,"Stayed with a few friends and the whole trip was underwhelming and disappointing. Checkin was overly complicated and started the trip off on a bad note. We had dinner in the hotel on the first night and although the food was grand, the dining room was just in the lobby and felt like we‚Äôre were eating in an airport. I would have imagined for a 5* hotel they would have a proper dining room. 

Breakfast was not included and was horrendously overpriced. It was ‚Ç¨26 for a fairly basic continental breakfast, an extra ‚Ç¨10 for a few ‚Äúhot‚Äù food buffet bits which were cold and soggy. Also the breakfast process wasn‚Äôt explained to us when we were seated, we weren‚Äôt asked what we wanted or didn‚Äôt tell a staff member what we were going to have and a bill just appeared which identified which of us had food from the hot buffet and who just had continental. We felt like we were being watched by staff to see if we went near the hot food, it was unnerving and we weren‚Äôt even finished when the bill was put down so we felt like that was it, we couldn‚Äôt get anything else. My friend was charged ‚Ç¨26 and all she had was a banana and some cornflakes before the bill was put down. In fact, because we paid upfront for the rooms, we weren‚Äôt allowed to sign to our rooms (even though there was a credit card on file) so honestly felt like we were being chased by bills all weekend as if the staff thought we were going to ‚Äúdine and dash‚Äù. I felt like we couldn‚Äôt relax and have a drink without being chased by a credit card machine. We were accused of bringing in our own wine when we took the bottle of wine we had with dinner to the bar to finish it. And when we tried to go to the rooftop for a drink, the person who checks you in before you go upstairs wasn‚Äôt standing at the bottom of the lift (and we weren‚Äôt aware of his existence) so we started walking towards the lift and got an actual scolding and marched back to his desk. It was fairly embarrassing and I don‚Äôt think the way residence should be treated. We actually just felt a bit like bold school children all weekend.

There was in issue with our keys as well. There was some tech issue where all our keys stopped working and we had to go to reception several times until the problem was rectified. There was an apology note in our rooms that night with a turn down service, one of the rooms had some sweets and one didn‚Äôt which I found strange. 

The rooms were okay but the shower was not great, I think for what you are paying for the room a more modern shower is what you would expect. 

I just found the whole experience disappointing and I definitely won‚Äôt be back.",1,2022,11,13
206,5 Star,"Really enjoyed our stay, Rooftop bar was amazing. Staff so friendly. Breakfast in bed was Devine. Cleanliness great. Location beautiful and close to city centres. Highly Recommended Hotel for an overnight or weekend treat. ",5,2022,10,26

We enjoyed the most is the breakfast. It has very wide selection and very delicious too. The best that experience throughout my years of travelling. ( I travelled at least 2 times a year for vacation all over the world). Stayed in many hotels from posh to average. The Marker Hotel stands out from all the hote I stayed before. ",5,2022,10,26
206,Top hotel but only if the roof area is open,"Don't bother staying if the roof area isn't open.  This is a big selling point but closed half the week. This wasn't explained when I booked or I wouldn't have stayed there.  Therefore felt overpriced.

However everything else what excellent.  The rooms, breakfast, staff, all great.",3,2022,10,26
206,A brilliant guest experience,"We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. 

From the moment we arrived the staff were attentive, helpful, interested and personable. 

The 4 of us shared a corner room - it was quiet, well-appointed and well-maintained. 

We experienced exemplary service at the bars, breakfast restaurant and the spa. This was also the case with the fantastic concierge team.

I know I will leave people out but the following deserve particular mention for their amazing customer service:

Gabrielle on reception, Grace at breakfast, Daniel at concierge, and Cian and Rapiul at the bar.

Overall the perfect combination of amenity and amazing people.

We will return!

I really liked the room decor with their clever use of colour. Make sure your bring your swimmers as the moodily lit infinity pool is worth a trip in itself. Highly recommended hotel.

206,Dream hotel,The marker hotel is luxurious and comfortable with beautiful views and memorable dining experiences in the restaurant and at the bar with the most professional staff throughout the hotel . I enjoyed everything ,5,2022,10,17
206,The Marker - 15th Oct,"More value for money and more vegan and non-vegetarian food options are required.
Value for money - At 500 euros per night stay, we expected mini-bar to be complimentary at least couple of things.
We asked for bubble bath, nobody came to make a bubble bath so we eventually didn't even call back.

At breakfast, there were less vegan and non-vegetarian options, however, chef did make us a customized chicken sandwich which was great. ",4,2022,10,17
206,Excellent business stay!,"The service was outstanding. Very impressed with the quality of the hotel, location is well situated in the business district and walkable to many of the key tourist spots in Dublin City. Highly recommended!",5,2022,10,05
206,Lovely experience,"The location was great, room was beautiful and staff were very helpful. Myself and my husband loved how close we were to the city centre but also the total relaxation we got from the hotel. Truly lovely experience.",5,2022,10,03
206,Good but not great.,"5 star pricing for 3.5-4 star experience. Some aspect were indeed 5 star but many 'less than' lead to a relatively dissappinting stay. No grab/safety bars in the shower or tub area, each day having to request towels and coffee pods, discolored tile grout. And very pricey!",4,2022,10,03
206,Luxury Hotel Delights in the heart of Dublin,The rooms were spacious and thoughtfully designed. Bed was exceptionally  comfortable. Netspesso machine was perfect. The saline indoor pool and spa were amazing. This hotel was luxury all the way. Breakfast buffet offered plentiful and healthy choices. Conveniently located int he heart of the grand Canal area. Brian and Benjy from the concierge staff were so helpful and knowledgable.,5,2022,10,01
206,"Beautiful, relaxing. Service inconsistent.","I've already stated above. Bar service isn't great with servers disappearing for 20 minutes at a time. Because of our tipping customs, Americans are used to attentive service. Something to consider as you target local tech workers.",4,2022,09,30
206,Awesome!,"Very fancy place. Got the ""Royal Treatment"" from the moment I stepped out of the taxi! Bags were taken, water canned to me before I even got to the concierge desk. Plus, concierge desk was already aware I was here from other staff members. Very efficient and friendly hotel!",5,2022,09,28
206,THE place to stay in Dublin,"The Marker continues to set a world class standard. Everyone there is helpful and delivers. The Spa is a joy and the rooms, food, bars ALL top notch. It's safe, spotless and managed to an impressively high standard. It never disappoints.",5,2022,09,22
206,Over priced for what is a mediocre hotel,"So disappointed with our stay at The Marker.  The hotel guest areas are becoming tired and a little dismal to be honest.  The internal corridors to the bedrooms are tired and knocked about and the rooms themselves are standard with the exception of the bathroom which did actually live up to expectations. The breakfast was not what you should expect - rubber like scrambled eggs and pale bacon/sausages.
The staff were very efficient but it was way to transactional with now warmth or welcome.",2,2022,09,21
206,Not at all what I expected.,"While the room was clean and lovely, we would not recommend this hotel or spa.

The concierge and staff offered to help with reservations for meals and then not only did not make the reservations, kept saying they would get back to us in our room as we sat and waited (and never did), they hung up on us repeatedly claiming to be busy but when we went downstairs, there were no customers at either desk. 
This happened a number of times over a 24 hour period, had we been informed that they could not help, that would have been simple enough and we would have moved on.   However, we were reassured they were working on things for us, after a bad dinner the first night.   
After final losing it with the door man and getting angry, Rachel apologized and sent some treats the room while we were out that we didn't eat, because we had just had dinner. So they just got returned.

The Spa provides each customer one towel, so if you've been in the sauna and don't want to get back into a wet and soggy towel - you have to walk back to reception, which simply is silly.   
The showers in the women;s room are all broken.   The one I used was so clogged in the drain that water filled a large area of space and was a but stressful  Staff were fully aware of the issue.  
There is very limited water in the spa, in devices that are easily knocked over with teeny tiny paper cups.   Of course there are many purchase options!  No water in the women's dressing room and again, when using the steam or sauna, you have to move all over the place just to stay hydrated with teeny tiny paper cups. 
It's not safe or healthy for a spa to offer massage, steam and sauna and not make hydration easily available.
Also, the spa offers a small treat after the massage, but doesn't ask about allergies  - so I was unable to partake in that added pleasure.

A little customer service would have gone a long way in this situation.
Book elsewhere or plan ahead and be prepared!",2,2022,09,20
206,Visit the spa!,I loved this hotel. Stayed here with my partner on a business trip. Room was comfy for two. And the spa was so helpful while recovering from jet lag. This was my favorite hotel of the whole trip. Love it!,5,2022,09,12
206,The Marker Hotel,"This hotel was amazing! Staff was super friendly and the hotel itself was very clean and very comfortable. The location is a little far from the city center but definitely worth it. Amazing experience, 10/10!",5,2022,09,09

206,Fantastic service and hotel,"Stayed at The Marker from 29th Aug till 2nd September and was really pleased with the standard of hotel. The friendly, helpful and knowledgeable concierge and reception staff helped make the stay that bit more special. Special thanks to Mr Brian Sutton and his team including Kenny. Room was spotless and excellent condition. Loved the food, choice of cocktails and facilities. Waiting staff were super friendly too. The rooftop bar didn‚Äôt disappoint.

I would recommend The Celt Pub for traditional atmosphere and great music.",5,2022,09,02
206,Perfect stay in Ireland - recommend to all.,Amazing customer service throughout an aesthetically pleasing hotel.  All facilities were incredible and every aspect of our stay was perfect.

206,I'm sorry but I was terribly let down and left very disappointed.,"I contemplated leaving this review because I've never complained about a hotel in my life but unfortunately I was left with no choice. 

Before booking The Marker Hotel I contacted reservations to explain circumstances. I was offered a deal by their reservations manager which I was very thankful for. 

The next working day I contacted their Front Office Manager and explained matters in greater depth and asked if I could change the dates that was offered to the day before. 

I received a reply the same day and my request to change my date to a day earlier and for a room with a view was assured along with other treats. I was so happy and excited about this. I was asked to reply to the email if I wished to proceed with the booking, so that's what I done, that very same day.

Come the Wednesday when I hadn't heard back from anyone confirming the reservation, I rang the hotel. I was speaking to a lady called Rachel who looked on the system but could not find the reservation. 

She took my details including my mobile number and told me that she would look into this and either she or the front manager would get back to me by the Thursday. 

Come Friday I still did not receive any notification about the reservation. So once again I called the hotel and was speaking to a gentleman. Again, I gave him my details to check on the system but he too could not see any reservation.

He explained to me that the front office manager had gone home but that she would be in the following day and would sort this out and get back to me. Again, I didn't get a phone call or email from anyone and given I had rang twice already, I didn't feel it was my place to call for a third time. 

On the Sunday evening I had no choice but to cancel the trip because we had no reservation. I had tickets bought for a show in the Bord Gais Theatre for the Monday night but unfortunately we could not attend as well as other tickets held over for the Tuesday evening. Unless a show is cancelled or postponed, Ticketmaster won't refund tickets. 

As I'm sure you can understand, this annoyed and upset me for various reasons. I wanted this trip to be so special. Both the reservations manager and front office manager knew why it meant so much. 

On the Monday afternoon (the day we should have been away) I received an email from the reservations department informing me of my booking..for the wrong dates!!

Once again, I rang the hotel and explained the situation. I got speaking to a lady who was very nice and told me she would look into this and get back to me....unfortunately she too didn't get back to me, nobody did!! I again contacted the front office manager about this again...no reply!!

I understand how busy the hotel industry is but I am very let down and upset by this. I had my train ticket booked and our tickets for the shows and I had promised my mum a lovely few nights away only to be let down. Not only was I at a loss for the train and show tickets but this trip meant so much to me 

As I said at the start of this, I have never complained or left a negative review before but I have been badly let down and still don't know why.",1,2022,08,29
206,Mostly really good,"Driving up to the hotel was confusing and no one was out in front or came out in front until I went up to the entry.  Not a great start.  But after that all was good.  The hotel is sexy in today's style including the rooms.  The rooms are great but one can tell a man designed the bathrooms (I am a man but have built many properties and I notice things like this) because there is no counter space for a woman's items (let alone my small kit).  We did not eat breakfast in the hotel and cannot speak about it; but they were charging enough and we are light eaters at breakfast, as well as explorers, so my preference would be to eat out.  But all the staff were great including making recommendations of restaurants and sites in the City.  A visitor also has to recognize that this is at the east end of the City and creates a hefty walk to the center of the heart of old town Dublin.",4,2022,08,23
206,Fantastic hotel ‚Ä¶,"We stayed for two nights in The Marker hotel and loved every minute of our stay. We had a deluxe room with a floor to ceiling view of the canal and square, the bathroom was huge and the bed really comfy. We had breakfast - one of the best we‚Äôve ever had - and dinner in the restaurant on one night that we also really enjoyed.",5,2022,08,22
206,Excellent birthday weekend 10/10,"Came for my birthday and had an incredible long weekend at the Marker. 

Incredible service from Elise on the rooftop‚Ä¶. 
Absolutely recommend the roof top terrace at night and in the day as the views and service are exceptional. 

Brian is an amazing concierge who made my birthday, along with Grace (food and beverages manager) thank you both so much. 

Wonderful breakfasts and main meals during our stay in the Brasserie. 

Very comfortable room. Very clean and well designed. 

Massive thanks to all of the staff who have gone out of their way to make our stay as brilliant as it has been. 

Really enjoyed the spa and had a great massage and facial from Katie. 

Would absolutely recommend. 

Great location and great hospitality.",5,2022,08,22
206,A Docklands Gem,"A beautiful hotel in the up and coming docklands area. A short walk over the river into downtown Dublin.
Beautifully maintained, super helpful staff. There is a serenity about this hotel that offers you downtime after busy days in Dublin City. Great food options in the hotel and in the surrounding area.
A magnificent hotel that welcomes children ( I traveled with my 14 year old grandson) is hard to find.
Would return again in a heartbeat.",5,2022,08,22
206,Amazing stay,Stayed here in august for a gift. The hotel was amazing. We arrived and two guys came out to park our car they where really lovely. Top class. Every single employee we dealt with went over and beyond for us. Spa was lovely and very peaceful. Room was amazing. The layout of breakfast was lovely especially the cooked to order items. The manager on breakfast was lovely. Overall unbelievable stay would 100% stay again,5,2022,08,19
206,Well worth a visit,"Fantastic hotel, faultless. Excellent staff, courteous,helpful, professional.

206,Excellent Experience,"The Marker Hotel catered to everything I needed to have a restorative and productive business trip. From a highly attentive concierge to a state-of-the-art pool and spa facility I was able to take advantage of all that the Marker offered while being walking distance to my office. I even treated myself to a glass of Rose during a rare, clear, sunny Dublin day on their beautiful rooftop. I will definitely stay again if I return for business or vacation. ",5,2022,08,11
206,Birthday celebrations!,"Wow!! May I just say we absolutely loved our stay at The Marker with my sons. From the initial booking with Aisling to the very last minute with Brian the head conserge! Plus every member of staff! They couldn't do enough for us. The beautiful personal touches in the room for my birthday to drinks on the rooftop terrace. Breakfast was absolutely outstanding! Best night sleep ever in the most comfortable beds ever! And as for the spa and pool, well second to none! Absolutely stunning!! Cannot fault it! We've stayed before and we are definitely going to stay again! We didn't want to leave.
Thank you so much to every member of staff who went above and beyond to help make our stay fabulous!

206,Surprising success,"We took refuge at the Marker when another expensive hotel failed miserably.  We had a junior suite corner room, but could have done just as well with a regular king bedded room.  The rooms are generously sized for a Dublin hotel.  They are about to do a room refresh as the hotel rebrands (to something called Antantara), but other than a little tiredness on the cheap wooden furniture, the room and the bathroom were fine.  ONLY GAP:  no piece of furniture with drawers so you can unpack properly.  --- Buffet breakfast excellent, staff truly excellent, location is out of the most crowded center, but the residential neighborhood is VERY well served by FRESH grocery and Valentino's sandwich shoppe as well as numerous other cafes, and the canal dock area is a delight to hang out in, very unlike the hypercrowded center city from Stephen's Green to O'Connell Street, where the other major hotels are.  Five minutes' walk from the Convention Center, if that's relevant.  If you think every hotel in Dublin wants to imitate the Shelbourne, which is having a hard time imitating itself these days, this is the exception.",5,2022,08,09
206,The reception staff is not suitable for a 5* hotel,"The rooms were clean, very comfortable and SPA area as well.

Unfortunately, the wonderful weekend spend in the hotel had a very unpleasant ending. When we arrived at the hotel, the receptionist asked to reserve the accommodation cost for the room on my bank card, which is completely normal. At the checkout time I had to pay for accommodation and unfortunately instead of deducting it from my reserved amount, the receptionist charged me for the stay from the new. This meant that I paid for the night and still had a deposit reserved on my bank account. At the end of the checkout process, I checked my bank account and saw that something was wrong, because the price of the stay was booked twice. When I returned to the reception desk, I asked why this happened and got the answer that the employee who did the checkout is new and she is still learning. It caused me great inconvenience, because the price of the hotel is not very cheap, and it will take 3-5 working days for the reserved amount to return to the bank account. I asked if I could talk with the hotel manager and to check if there is no solution to fix it. And to my surprise, the ""manager or assistant manager"" was a girl who is new and made this mistake and she was not able to advice anything. So, I didn't get a normal explanation or even a simple apology for the inconvenience caused. The hotel is wonderful, but the unprofessionalism of the staff was very surprising. Also, when asked for an explanation, there was a very rude whisper between staff. This is definitely not a 5* service and employees should be trained properly especially when it comes to bigger money transactions. This causes me a lot of inconvenience.",1,2022,08,08
206,Location is perfect. Attention to detail is superb. ,"From walking into the lobby to the well attentive staff, we highly recommend this hotel. The room was beautiful, spacious and super comfortable.  The bellmen were fantastic as well. There is a rooftop bar that has a great view of the city. Location is perfection!",5,2022,08,07
206,Made this meeting planner look like a super star,"The Marker Hotel staff, location, and venue itself could not have been better. The onsite team was wonderful to work the event manager assisted with all our last-minute updates and requests. Natalia, the sales& event manager made the entire process efficient and easy. It was nerve-wracking picking a hotel for all our executive leaders, especially when I could not be onsite, but The Marker made me look like a super star. I am grateful.",5,2022,08,03
206,A Fantastic place to stay,The Marker is the most amazing place to stay and the Staff in all areas are excellent. I felt so pampered the whole time. Thought I'd died and gone to Heaven. Just wonderful . I am singing it's praises to everyone I speak to ,5,2022,08,03
206,"Exceptional service, perfect breakfast and an all round incredible hotel","Incredible hotel, from the moment we stepped out of the taxi the service was exceptional. The room was lovely with a nice view, Spa area was great to use and very relaxing. Breakfast was by far the best I have ever had in a hotel. The staff every single one we came across could not have been more helpful. The only disappointment was when we arrived back after dinner on the Sat night around 10pm we were told the rooftop bar was closed and we had to get the last table left at the bar downstairs which was right beside the door. I got the feeling the majority of people in the bar weren‚Äôt actually residents given that a lot of them left the building after finishing so it would be good if those staying in the hotel would have a private area to have a drink, we stayed for one and went to the room probably would have stayed for more if this was the case. Thankfully on the last day the lovely Irish man looking after the rooftop let us have a quick look before we left. Good service is so hard to come by nowadays so I would highly recommend staying here if your after a special time.",5,2022,08,02
206,Excellent Anniversary weekend in Dublin,"The Marker hotel helped facilitate our 25th Wedding Anniversary party held in Dublin providing accommodation for all our guests from the UK. Nothing was too much trouble, and it went really well in large part because of the quality of the accommodation and service all our guests received at the Marker Hotel. Everyone commented on the quality of the hotel and everything offered from the spa, the Marker bar, the Roof top bar and of course the great rooms.",5,2022,07,31
206,City break,"What a stunning hotel! A fantastic experience beginning with a welcome from the front staff, parking our hire car, receptionist most welcoming checking us in earlier, explaining everything and offering extras.  We felt totally spoilt. On top of that the highlights of our stay in the hotel were the visits to the roof top bar and the spa. One of the best swimming pools, jacuzzis and saunas ‚Ä¶ heaven!",5,2022,07,30
206,Extended Stay at the Marker Hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for 10 nights on our 30th anniversary trip this month.  The stay was first class from beginning to end.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the hotel was quiet at night which is important to recharge after a day full of activities.  The staff was top notch, friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend and will definitely stay here again. ",5,2022,07,30
206,Premiere Stay,"What a lovely hotel at a convenient location. Staff and service are truly five star. We paid a bit more than we usually would to stay here, but splurged because it was our first stop after an international flight. It was more than worth it! Excellent view from the roof bar. ",5,2022,07,28
206,Dave Lowther,"Excellent  Stay. Arrival in car park underneath OK - Beware spaces are tight and you really need a centre space with out adjacent columns/walls. Couldn't find my booking but resolved quickly - had printed off my room confirmation before arrival. Room was modern, clean and tidy particularly bathroom/shower. No view but I didn't need one. Convenience in that on canal front and just 20 mins walk takes you to Trinity College and Temple Bar.  Service was good and breakfast was good with very good hot and cold options..",5,2022,07,27
206,Weekend trip,"A great hotel to stay in and worth the money. Service and food were excellent. Staff were friendly and very professional, they couldn't do enough for you.
The gym and spa facilities were also very good.",5,2022,07,27
206,Corporate Client Night- July,"To say that the team at the Marker are amazing would somehow understate their ability to continuously deliver. 

We recently held a corporate event at the Marker for 150 people and from start to finish, the process was seamless. Attention to detail is something that is so important in the event space, and the Marker ensures that standard is met head on with each event we put towards them. 

Fantastic Team and a fantastic experience, would highly recommend hosting any events in this venue. 

Notable mentions; 

Natalia, our point of contact for setting up the night, was always on hand, very professional, very approachable and an absolute pleasure to deal with. 

Peter, our operations manager for the night was never out of sight, he was always present and attentive to the requirements of our delegates. His experience speaks for itself with his attention to detail and his great attitude. 

The waiting staff and bar staff; The staff were really something else; very adaptable to different parts of the evening and very cognizant of our delegates on the night. This team runs as a well oiled machine and we were very happy with them. The bar staff on hand were very capable of dealing with large influxes of people at one time and made the night run very smoothly on that end. 

Thanks Guys, we will surely be back. ",5,2022,07,22
206,Upmarket hotel in center of Dublin corporate hub,"Upmarket hotel in the heart of a corporate hub in Dublin. Walking distance from all major corporations, few restaurants and pubs as well. There are stores like Spar and Fresh which are just 100 meters away. Their roof top bar has some stunning views and food is also a plus point. Staff is courteous and pro active in responding to all your queries
Rooms are well furnished and interiors go well with the overall hotel theme. Room service is there with a charge of 6 euros and is available for 24 hours. ",5,2022,07,21
206,July Wedding 2022,"We recently had a small wedding in the Marker Hotel in July 2022. To say we are satisified is an understatement. Jesse our wedding coordinator and Gareth the Head chef, plus all the staff on duty for our special day ensured that everything ran smoothly. We had excellent food and service throughout our stay, the terrace was amazing where we had our pre-dinner drinks and canapes, then followed by dinner in the bistro where the atmosphere was incredible. We really cant wait to return and have another weekend getaway. If you want high standards of service and excellent food then the marker is the place to go. Exceptional location for a wedding venue,  all our expectations where met and more.
Big congrats to all the staff for making our wedding experience truly exceptional.

From the Happy Couple Gav & lou",5,2022,07,18

206,Wedding June 24th 2022,"We got married on June 24th 2022 and we had such a wonderful experience in the Marker hotel. The staff, service, and hotel as a venue were all spectacular. We would like to thank everyone for making our experience such a wonderful one with memories that will last a lifetime. All of our guests commented on what a beautiful day it was and in particular to the food, drinks and service in the Marker hotel. Thank you Jesse, our wedding coordinator. You were lovely to deal with and all came together with such ease. We look forward to visiting you again another time, we will aim for our 1 year anniversary! Thank you once again from Sheila & Tom",5,2022,07,11
206,Fantastic family stay,"This is by far our favourite hotel in Ireland and can‚Äôt recommend it enough.  We recently stayed to celebrate a special occasion with our daughter and hotel staff went over and beyond as usual.  From the minute we pulled up greeted by door staff, quick check in and sitting enjoying a drink in the bar within 10 minutes of arrival. 

We also dined at the hotel that evening and having a very picky eater Chef Gareth Mullins accommodated requests without any hesitation. Bar staff very attentive to all of us making sure everything was to our satisfaction.  Security then arranged for a table on the rooftop and again the service continued to be impeccable.

In the room staff went out of their way again to ensure the room was decorated for the special occasion including a personalised welcome back card, personalised well done card from the staff and a congratulations welcome plate. All of this helping us make everlasting memories and keepsakes. 

Breakfast here is one of the best in all the hotels we have stayed in and the salmon and pancakes where our fav. 

Finally before a late checkout we managed to get to the spa for a swim in the pool (child times 10-12) which the child throughly enjoyed. 

Overall a fantastic stay and would recommend the hotel to anyone looking a unique, modern 5 star hotel. 

Thanks to all Team Marker and can‚Äôt wait to see you all again soon.",5,2022,07,09
206,Truly underwhelmed ,"There was some things about the Marker that was very good. But unfortunately when you're a 5 star you have to be a lot better than they were in a few areas. 

We stayed towards the end of June and were underwhelmed with a few things but must start with a few of the positives. Check in and valet parking on arrival was good but as our room wasn't ready when we arrived early we went off walking around Dublin as was our plan, we were awaiting a call that never came to tell us our room was ready. After enjoying the sights of Dublin we headed back around 5pm to find out if indeed our room was actually ready, thankfully it was. 

The room was nice and spacious and overall a nice enough hotel room but as a 5 star I expect it to be amazing. I've stayed in several world class 5 star hotels around the world and this wasn't up to scratch. The bed wasn't very comfortable and the pillows were way too soft, no alternative pillows were available. The plug hole in the sink in our bathroom was broken and the shower leaked all over the floor. Maybe in a 3 or 4 star you let that kind of thing slide but it can't be allowed it what is meant to be a leading hotel of the world. 

The overall cleanliness of the lobby bar was lacking. The sofa on which we sat for evening cocktails was stained badly and was quite off putting. Upon check in we were told that we couldn't access the roof top bar as there was a private function I would have liked some form of notification of this as we had planned to go up for a night cap. We sat and had a few cocktails after we came back from dinner out but unfortunately the waiting staff were clueless. I'm not sure if they were new or just having a very bad day but we almost had to go to the bar ourselves to order drinks and the bar was not busy. Even then there was a language barrier when trying to order. I ordered the same cocktail 3 times and got 3 different versions, none of them were bad but surely consistency should be there.

The carpets on our floor between the lift and our room were also badly stained and worn. I really think that this should be better if you truly are expecting to offer a 5 star luxury experience.

Overall we left a little underwhelmed by what was meant to be a lovely romantic break away from our kids. The breakfast was lovely and Javier was most attentive to us, so not all bad. But too many things that should not be missed were sadly found wanting. I was in too much of a rush to speak to anyone at check out as we had to make our way home. For the amount it costs there are much better options around Dublin. ",2,2022,07,05
206,Abysmal service.,"Returning to the hotel at 11mins past midnight on a Friday night I decided to have a drink in the residents bar.
I was prevented from entering the bar area even though a number of people were present ,all with drinks in front of them.
I was informed that the till was locked but that I could have a drink charged to my room but would have to drink it in my room.
So at 00:15 on a Friday night in a 5 star hotel I had to go to a  Weatherspoons pub next door to get a drink in comfort.
520 Euro a night to be treated like this.
Disgracefull",1,2022,07,04
206,Lovely atmosphere nice food and drink,"Enjoyed a steak dinner with my wife. Nice surroundings, food was delicious & cocktails excellent. Well done to Scott a manager there. Very attentive & customer focused. A great representative for the hotel.

Will definitely return for food again",4,2022,06,28
206,Very bad experience and poor customer service,"1. My daughter emailed 10 months in advance that I was disabled and required a walk in shower. While our room had grabrail, the shower was in the bath. When we rang down to reception we were told that we had an accessible room. When I pointed out that the shower was in the  bath, they conceded, that it wasn't accessible, stating it was ""mostly"" accessible. After a few more calls to reception, the put us in another room. While the room had a walk in shower, it also had several problems.
The bed in the room was two high and was not suitable for a transfer from wheelchair to bed.
2.The member of staff apologised and told us to go to the bar after the concert and have any drink we wanted, we didn't do that.
When we returned to our room, there were two drink voucher which excluded certain spirits and cocktail. I would have been embarrassed and annoyed if I had ordered a cocktail, not having read the small print and taking the member of staff at his word. 
3. We decided to treat ourselves and have breakfast in our rooms at the cost of  30 euros each. The breakfast consisted of one of each of the following, sausage, mushroom, pudding and egg. It was not 5 star quality.
4. Just a simple thing that may sound picky but shows that lack of detail that is required for a 5 star experience. I rang down to reception and asked for a jug of water with lemon and two pint glassed full of ice. A jug of water with lemon arrived and no pint glasses with ice.
5. our original booking was for a twin room, our second room had a double bed which meant my daughter slept on a pull out cot bed.
6.. on check out I asked to speak to the manager. She listened and agreed the ""mostly"" accessible wasn't accessible after some back and forth. I really fely she did not hear me. I felt she just wanted to get me out the door.
7. When I returned home, I wrote a detailed message to Aisling Byrne, Guest Relations Manager and to date have not received a reply.
NOT A 5 STAR EXPERIENCE",1,2022,06,28
206,The Best Customer Service - Ever!,"We stayed at The Marker as a family of five with two kids (10/10/7).  Our luggage did not arrive from Amsterdam with us (thanks BA) for 2.5 days.  The staff at the hotel went out of their way to make shopping recommendations for us and even offered to drop us off at the department store so we could buy what we needed.
When our tour company called the next morning to say that our privately-chartered trip to the Cliffs of Moher was canceled due to the guide testing positive to COVID-19, we were defeated.  My wife and I thought this was it, our first trip to Ireland was ruined by things we simply had no control over.  That was until our hero came by our table at breakfast. 
The hotel's executive chef, Gareth Mullins, had heard about the family with no luggage and a canceled tour.  He came by our table at breakfast and recommended that we visit the Dublin Zoo.  We took him up on that and without even having to ask, he made us the best picnic lunch backpack to take along with us!  This backpack had sandwiches, bags of chips, drinks, fruit, snack desserts, and large bottle of still water inside!  The hotel didn't ask for payment, nor was it charged back to our room, it was just an extremely kind gesture.  I cannot tell you the impact this had on our trip - it made our day and we had a fantastic time at the Dublin Zoo/Phoenix Park!
Gareth, along with the hotel GM and bell man, recommended that we take the train  the next day to Howth.  This was another perfect idea, our kids loved it there as there was a nice playground, coffee shops, ice cream stores, and beautiful scenery along the coast.  We spent a good portion of the day in the town catching the train back to Dublin around 5:30p. (If in Dublin and looking for something to do - visit this town, it's so easy and the trains are safe)
I know some prior reviews state the Docklands area may not be ideal for tourists, but I would disagree.  We originally planned to stay at a hotel on Stephen's Green, but switched to The Marker after reading the hotel's positive reviews on TA.  When in the city, we found Stephen's Green to be congested, loud, and a bit claustrophobic.  The Docklands is quiet and VERY open.  It's loaded with tech companies like Google and Meta.  There's an open area just below the hotel where some of locals hang out.  There's music, dancing, studying, yoga, napping going on, it's great people-watching and they're all gone by dark, so there are no issues with noise.  If you're without kids, there are several bars within a 2-5 minute walk.  We found it easy to get to the train station and the overall area in general very clean - our kids loved it!  You can always have the car ride service, Free Now, take you to the shopping/tourist areas and then walk back.  We did and it's about a 20 minute journey (with kids).
In all, The Marker is a hotel that I have absolutely no problem recommending.  Thanks to everyone there who helped us forget about the issues we were having and reminded us to enjoy Dublin.  You made our first trip to Ireland special - GM Michael, Gareth, Rachel, Mario, Daniel, the bell service, front desk staff, and the breakfast dining service team!",5,2022,06,27
206,Marker for Dublin,"Very well appointed hotel, great spa and indoor pool with hot tub. Slightly larger and more modern rooms than Conrad or Westbury. It might be better suited to business people  visting offices in Grand Canal, than tourists as its 15-20 minutes walk to central Dublin (i.e. Grafton Street).",5,2022,06,27
206,Rip off price euro 780 for one night,On booking sites euro 380 but direct check in euro 780. Total rip off. As we did not have internet on arrival in Dublin and our original hotel had mixed up our arrival date we were forced to find a hotel at midnight.only available was the marker. How do you justify this price?,1,2022,06,25
206,Lovely Hotel adjacent to the former Odlums mill canal dock area,"Lovely Hotel, clean and mostly very efficient staff.   Not crazy about the dining area - fine for breakfast but atmosphere-less for dinner - go elsewhere.   Lovely pool and well equipped gym.  Located in a buzzy area a bit removed from the very centre of town but very walkable or a quick taxi ride. ",4,2022,06,21

206,My Brilliant Experience at The Marker,"From moment of arrival to my sad departure, I loved every minute of my stay. My bed was so comfortable that I ignored my breakfast the first day. Wish I didn't as the food was fab! I always stay in luxury hotels across Europe and this one really stood out for me. At one point I wanted to extend my stay at the last minute.  I will make this an annual event. I want to be able to a legend in the hotel! ;-)",5,2022,06,13
206,Great hotel with great staff,"We stayed here on our last day in Ireland and really enjoyed our stay!

Location - really great!  There are great places to eat nearby and a nice pedestrian area along the water in front of hotel.

Rooms - Our room was large and spacious with comfortable bed.  Bottle of water was provided for us.

Service - The staff was really great!  They assisted us with storing our car while we went for our covid test.  Knowing that we were leaving for a very early morning flight and would miss our breakfast, they provided a real feast for us very early that morning along with a box to put to go food in.  The food was great and made us regret not getting to taste their regular breakfast.  That was above and beyond and we really appreciated and enjoyed it.

We would definitely stay there again",5,2022,06,12

206,Disappointed,"I don‚Äôt normally like to give really negative reviews but I have to say that I was really disappointed with the Marker. Stayed with my husband on Friday 20th May. Tried to check in at 18.00 and told the room was not ready ???? Asked to wait in the bar and have a drink. We did , and were charged for the drink which was unexpected given our room was not ready ‚Ä¶arrived for breakfast next morning at 10.35 and greeting with no clean tables available and no employees on the floor. Got a table and waited almost 20 minutes for coffee . Overall not the experience we were expecting. We responded to the survey giving feedback and received an automated response. I called the hotel to ask to speak to a manager for guest relations. Was told to call back when they were less busy and ‚Äú no, sorry‚Äù they couldn‚Äôt take my number and call me.I understand the hotel was busy and they said they were understaffed but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the hotel as the price paid does not equate to the service.",2,2022,06,03

206,A few days away for my Birthday.,"I always read these reviews prior to booking anywhere to get a feel for a place, and hopefully find out a little more than the glossy brochures tell you. I also write them to try and answer the questions that i wish id had answers to before I booked. 

The hotel is lovely, the staff attentive and the overall finish is outstanding, a few niggles that may or may not bother you; 

The staff taking drinks orders at breakfast - they got them wrong every time!!

Kids in the SPA - Its rather less relaxing with shrieking kids practicing their dive bombing. 

The windows don't open, we were with another couple and none of us manged to get a temperature that we were happy with.

The hotel is lovely, its well positioned and the roof bar is very cool.",4,2022,03,21

Overall the experience was great, the room was spacious and comfy, the bathroom amazing.
Staff overall were friendly and welcoming except Grace in the Brasserie. As the welcoming face at breakfast we did not find her welcoming at all, a bit abrupt on both mornings and not one smile.
The roof top terrace although a little chilly despite heaters and blankets was a great experience, the views were amazing, drinks reasonable and tasty snacks.
Reception team were wonderful.
Derek was friendly and very Informative of the hotel and local history was fascinating.
The corridors were too dark for my liking but just a personal opinion.

The bed was incredibly comfortable and the room was lovely and roomy. We ate in the Brasserie and really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.

206,Hits the Mark!,"This is my third trip to The Marker hotel and it really is one of the best if you are visiting Bord Gais - however it is (in my opinion) slightly overpriced. The staff are amazing - extremely attentive and welcoming and there are lots of fantastic little extras - chocolates in your room on arrival and a brilliant turn down service, all of these little extras make the stay special and memorable.  However, on this occasion I had booked a room for myself, my mum and my son (aged 9) as we were visiting Bord Gais to see a show and I paid just under ‚Ç¨400 for Bed and Breakfast. When dividing this between 3 I thought this was quite reasonable for the convenience to the Theatre and having experienced The Marker before I thought it was be a nice treat. However, was extremely disappointed to find that the room was really only for 2 people - a pretty flimsy make shift camp bed set up in the room for the third person. Whilst my son is only 9, he is a big growing boy at 5 foot 5 and after alot of jumping around and unable to get comfortable it ended up 3 in the bed around 2am which was absolutely not ideal.

Breakfast was absolutely gorgeous. Service was first class and couldn't be faulted (staff really are this hotels biggest attribute).

The hotel itself is outstanding. Beautifully designed, tranquil spaces and an overall feel of calm with a very well trained team that made you feel at home on every level 
The staff were all fantastic. Starting from the reception through to the back of house services.  The food was brilliant (in particular the breakfast) and the bar offered a great variety of cocktails and other drinks and not at inflated prices.

One of the few hotels that will always go that one step further to ensure the best experience for their customers. You won‚Äôt regret booking.,5,2022,01,16
206,Overnight break away,We just had a wonderful stay at the Marker and once again it didn't disappoint. From the time we pulled up outside the front door to having our car delivered to us for our journey home the service was exceptional. The rooms are gorgeous and you would sink into the softest pillows ever. Couldn't fault anything with this hotel and the staff go over and above to make sure your stay is as comfortable as possible. Breakfast was lovely with a great selection of food to choose from. Well done to the Marker once again. I  can't wait to return.,5,2022,01,16
206,Dublin City Visit,"Ideally situated extremely comfortable modern hotel with service second to none.   Most attentive staff, excellent food and drinks and super spa facility.  Would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to avail of a break in the centre of Dublin",5,2022,01,11
206,Ticked all the boxes,I booked a night away for my hubby for Christmas and boy did it not disappoint. Attention to detail from all the staff is second to none. Our room was beautiful and the bed so comfortable and the nespresso machine was a big hit. The food for dinner and breakfast was outstanding and I no longer drink so to have such an array of non alcoholic wines & cocktails it really made my night. We tried out the rooftop bar it was a bit chilly but plenty of blankets available if you want to try it out. We never got to check out the spa but I hear it‚Äôs great we will definitely be back to the Marker soon.,5,2022,01,09
206,Our experience,"We had a wonderful experience with you, staff were so nice and very professional in there work, lovely room and great food, would definitely recommend this hotel to others and ideal if you were going to the theatre longside",5,2022,01,07

206,"Wonderful service, great for a family stay","Adjoining rooms with a view worked well. Staff very friendly and accommodating. Pool/spa facilitates excellent (kids loved the pool). Food in restaurants and room service was great. 

Rooftop was closed for winter but have been there in summer and it is a good spot!",5,2022,01,05
206,Exceptional family break,"Absolutely exceptional hotel. Loved everything about it. We stayed during my daughter‚Äôs 18th birthday and the happy birthday letter and dessert where a very nice touch. Staff, facilities and food where excellent. Spa facilities where very good. Will definitely be back",5,2022,01,04
206,The best place possible NOT to relax after Xmas,"Unlike so many hotels that claim to have such a focus on customer service (and really don't care), staff here actually behave as if it's their role in life to make customers glad to stay. It's really quite remarkable that a 5 star hotels in Dublin actually delivers a 5 star service. Not just give the marketing PR which is forgotten about as soon as it is put on the web site but actually deliver what they promise

Well done The Marker",5,2022,01,03
206,Nice & stylish hotel,"Modern and comfortable hotel. Probably the best hotel in Dublin. 
Quiet and no traffic noise. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast was wonderful. 
Hotel parking available.
There are bicycles for rent outside in the street.",5,2022,01,02
206,Some spot,"Group of us treated ourselves to a pre xmas night away in the big smoke, great spot. Service spot on, no messing about with Covid restrictions. Early cut off and sent packing to bed but nice night to recharge the batteries.",5,2021,12,26
206,"Lovely hotel, relaxing stay","Staff very attentive and welcoming. Room was modern with a great view of grand canal and the mountains. Spa facilities were first class, very relaxing. 

Room service food quality was the only thing I could fault. Everything I ordered was tasty but nothing special.",5,2021,12,18
206,Weekend stay,"I had a fabulous time at the marker hotel, however as stated in my review I was deeply upset that the minibar in the room which I selected as a deluxe room was not stocked due to Covid measures. Although I was able to get room service drinks to my room and pay for them. It didn‚Äôt make any sense at all and I had to order more drinks to the room as I had told my partner there was one stocked when there wasn‚Äôt.",4,2021,12,17
206,10/10,We‚Äôll all I can say is an absolutely fabulous stay. The hotel is so clean and all the staff are absolutely fantastic. A big shoutout to Derek working downstairs a lovely man and a gentleman ready to help and make you‚Äôre stay as good as it can be! Breakfast was fab and the dinner was yum too in the brasserie. The spa is so clean and the ladies we had giving our massages were lovely. Will definitely be back again.,5,2021,12,13
206,Our new favourite place! ,"100% you need to book this hotel! The service was excellent and the hotel itself was beautiful!! My partner proposed to me on the stunning roof top bar arranged by the hotel manager Nutu which we are both so grateful for... was a last min change due to his original plan being cancelled! Definitely a 5* experience from start to finish! Food and cocktails were amazing in the bar area and restaurant! Also the spa treatments were 10/10 very professional and the spa itself is relaxing and has everything you need! We will definitely be back! Thankyou again, Kayleigh & Terry :)",5,2021,12,11
206,Elena,"We had a wonderful experience. The staff was exceptionally friendly and accommodating. We had dinner and breakfast, both were great. The room was spotlessly clean and specious. Even though the rooftop bar was closed, Aisling, the manager, brought us to see the amazing view. Highly recommend it!",5,2021,12,11
206,Loved every minute,We stayed here for a 40th Birthday and the attention to detail was amazing. The hotel itself is beautiful and the pool area is so relaxing. We ate and drank both in the bar and on the rooftop and both were excellent. I think the most outstanding part of this hotel is the staff throughout. They couldn‚Äôt do enough for us without being over bearing and they were attentive. We have already booked to stay again,5,2021,11,30
206,Excellent,"Stayed in the Marker hotel in June, all staff were very professional. Valet parking is available and super convenient given the location. Rooms are cozy and cleaned to the highest standard. The spa and pool area are well organized (booking in advance is highly recommended).",5,2021,11,25
206,Perfect night getaway.  I would highly recommend.  Ideal for electric car owners,"My wife and I stayed at the Marker for 1 night as we were attending a concert in the EE arena which is conveniently located nearby.

On arrival staff were very welcoming, we parked at the lobby and were treated like VIP's from the moment we walked through the door.
Our baggage was taken care of and car parked.  It was very convenient that they were able charge my Tesla overnight so I didn't have to worry about finding a charger the following day.

We received a room upgrade which was a nice plus.  The room was spacious, I wasn't a massive fan of the decor of the room but the bed was comfortable and the Nespresso machine was great.
The bathroom was amazing.  I've stayed in a lot of hotels throughout the world and this was one of my favourites.  Lovely Malin & Goetz toiletries, plush robes and towels and a heated floor was such a nice touch.

I would've liked to have tried the brasserie restaurant however we had to dine early in the kitchen bar which had a similar menu.  
Eating dinner at an area which is mainly intended on lounging and having drinks wasn't the most comfortable but the food was good and overall we enjoyed the experience.

Unfortunately we didn't get a chance to check out the spa facilities or breakfast as it was a short stay but we will definitely return in the future.",5,2021,11,24
206,Fantastic! We'll definitely do it again:),"Spent two nights in The Marker in November 2021 and had an absolutely fantastic experience. Staff were all lovely, attention to detail is superb. Food is beautiful. Kenneth the concierge is just so good at his job and worth his weight in gold. I don't remember names of other employees however they are all superb! There seems to be a slight issue with chefs and kitchen professionals which is a common problem at the moment. I'm sure the people working in catering are under pressure and are doing a fantastic job. I certainly appreciate them. The hotel is so clean and well maintained it's a credit to all who work there.",5,2021,11,21
206,5‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê from start to finish,"Absolutely  Fabulous  5‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê in The Marker  from once we stepped through the doors to driving off home we were so well treated. Brilliant staff especially Leon who we  checked in with, he was pleasant, courteous  and so welcoming. our room was spotless  the toiletries beautiful, the pool and spa luxurious and the food and drinks  delicious. Can't wait to return. Thank you to all in The Marker üíñ",5,2021,11,20
206,Amazing night away for my partner's 50th birthday.,"I booked a quiet night at The Marker for my partner who was turning 50 the day after checking in.  I wanted to wake up at The Marker and have a quiet morning in bed.

From the moment I booked the room, the response was fab. Catriona  booked us in for drinks at the roof bar, booked us in for a swim the following morning... nothing was a problem.  The correspondence was seriously on point.

Two days before we checked in, I arrived from London with a carry-on bag full of presents for my partner, which needed to be kept safely until our arrival.  I had the pleasure of meeting Barry White who is The Marker's Guest Relations Manager... he epitomises the word SERVICE.

The day we checked in, I was having something delivered to the room, from a local suppler, for my partner's pre birthday supper in the room.  Not only did concierge take the delivery in my absence, they kept it refrigerated for me, and brought it the room with plates and cutlery.  WOW!!!  Nothing was a problem.

We actually hibernated in the room the entire time we were there and sadly didn't sample the restaurant, the pool or the roof terrace, but we had THE BEST TIME EVER.  The room was beautiful and spacious, the breakfast was great.  

I can't thank you enough.  Can't wait to come back.
Alison and Adam",5,2021,11,16
206,Lovely stay,"Lovely hotel, nice decor and atmosphere. The only suggestion I have is to have a kettle in the room - there is a coffee machine but I prefer tea! I small detail, otherwise a very nice stay with my wife",5,2021,11,16
206,Excellent !,"Everything was excellent, i needed a little break from work and the marker hotel made my vacation enjoyable. Although I have not tried the spa or pool but i am sure that it was clean, and relaxing. I liked the breakfast and the menu had most of things i wanted, dinner was amazing as well for having friendly staff and delicious food served. i would really recommend the marker to my friends and family , it really did help me clear my mind and sort my work out while enjoying the stay. Keep up the good work i would defiantly visit again",5,2021,11,03
206,Clean friendly place to stay,"Good location, room was very clean, quiet and had everything we needed. Spa experience was excellent and staff were very helpful and friendly. We were greeted at arrival and car parked for us and taken care of for the night. Room was amazing with a nice view.",5,2021,11,03
206,Theatre stay at the Marker,"Had a wonderful nights stay at the Marker, booked a night as was going to see a show and wanted to stay near by especially due to all the COVID restrictions and will definitely stay again! 
Hotel was beautiful, food was fabulous in the rooftop restaurant and great cocktails in the main bar. My daughter and I used the leisure facilities which were spotless and  we generally just had a great time. All the Staff we interacted with were so friendly and really we couldn‚Äôt ask for anything more! 
We opted for breakfast in our room and it was glorious and my teenage daughter loved the top rated room service, kitchen even made her a breakfast which was not on the room service menu, honestly can not rate the service high enough! It was our first show and night away since restrictions were lifted and the Marker made sure we had a great trip! Can‚Äôt wait to visit again xx",5,2021,11,02
206,Superb hotel,"Had a 5 night stay at The Marker, the service was excellent. We were given a room upgrade and breakfast included. The room was huge and the bed so comfortable. The bathroom was huge and the underfloor heating a wonderful surprise. 
We used the pool, jacuzzi and sauna which was clean and restricted to 8 people due to Covid but this helped me to feel safe. 
The breakfast was delicious, some buffet but also table service, we have to recommend the pancakes which we‚Äôre light and fluffy. Our table server Francesco was so friendly and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us every morning. 
We also visited the rooftop bar to watch the sunset over Dublin, drinks reasonably priced and we were supplied with blankets to keep us warm on an October evening. 
We cannot recommend this hotel any more highly - an amazing stay.",5,2021,11,01
206,Cocktails then dinner at the Marker Brasserie,"My family and I went to the Marker hotel on Thursday 28th October. We relaxed in the bar and ordered cocktails before dinner. The staff were friendly and professional. ‚Ä¨

‚Ä™Dinner in their brasserie was absolutely divine. The ambience, relaxed pace and service were faultless. Thank you to Tom, our waiter from the Netherlands (who is currently on an internship at the Marker) for your good service and friendly conversation.‚Ä¨",5,2021,11,01
206,Outstanding Hotel- Best in Dublin,"Beautiful Hotel with fantastic staff, fabulous rooms, excellent spa and outstanding service. A minor issue on our last night when there was a leak in the bathroom from the room upstairs; staff arrived within 1 minute, offered an alternative room right away, but no need. When checking out, one of the Managers stepped up and apologised for the inconvenience which was a very nice touch. I will definitely be back.",5,2021,10,29
206,Great stay!,"Really nice overnight stay with family. The hotel is in a very central location for Dublin, so it was easy to walk around the city and docks from there as a base. I found that the staff were lovely and attentive and food was great!",5,2021,10,28
206,Great staff. Great venue. Can't fault it.,"Family stayed recently. Excellent. Staff were helpful. Rooms were great. Food was probably the only let down. Cooked breakfast wasn't great but the snacks and fruit were lovely.  
There was a Dublin guy working there as ""concierge"" and give the man a raise. Absolute gent, helpful. Made us feel at home. And I'm from Dublin!",5,2021,10,19
206,Fabulous,"Fabulous Hotel 

Expensive but fabulous 

Just for the cocktails i would return !

If it wasnt for the Covid restrictions it would have been a five star but tue hotel couldnt do anything about that, a gem in the centre of Dublin. highly recommended",4,2021,10,18
206,Sat nite outing,"Lovely hotel to stay in .. staff ,service all incredible .. highly recommended.. especially rooftop bar . Room very comfortable and everything you needed was in place  lovely area with places to eat and drink",5,2021,10,10
206,Awesome Hotel with Great Service!,"This hotel has top-notch service - arranging every detail of things I needed from restaurant reservations, porter service, arranging a taxi and scheduling for a COVID19 test to be performed at the hotel.  The rooms were spacious and very modern. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable.   I was also able to use the Business Center for a quiet place to work.  I would recommend this hotel as a great place to stay but it's the way I was treated that will be the reason I return!",5,2021,10,04
206,Our go to in Dublin!!,"Although it is just a tad out of the tourist part of Dublin, that‚Äôs what we like about it.  It‚Äôs in a vibrant part of Dublin, but quiet at night.  The room too bar is wonderful.  The rooms are large with nice views - the bathrooms are unbeatable.  Lovely large shower and deep separate bath.  Heated floors.  And everyone is so nice and accommodating.  

COVID has limited their breakfast and I would not recommend it.  It‚Äôs good -  it was at over priced right now.  Our three adults worth coffee and eggs and toast was over $50.  Pre-COVID I recall you could buy the breakfast and the full bar as well as hot food was available for about $25 a person.  If you can avoid having a car, do.  Valet is a bit expensive,  but that‚Äôs true of the whole town.",5,2021,10,03
206,Excellent location and friendly staff but food not up to expectations,My wife and I visited The Marker hotel this weekend for the first time .  The accommodation and location is excellent including the rooftop bar and  the Spa area which is exceptional . Staff were very friendly and helpful. The only disappointment was the food and in particular the breakfast. I choose a full Irish with myself and my wide both having tea. Tea and the full Irish breakfast were both lukewarm. Breakfast seemed to have been kept too long under  a hot plate or heat lamp as it seemed over cooked. I pointed this out to the serving staff who apologized. Having taken a number of short breaks this year I would rank the cooked breakfast  offering as poor  and it took away from the overall experience.,3,2021,09,28
206,Birthday visit,"I recently stayed at The Marker Hotel with my daughter for my birthday. We had the most wonderful time from the second we arrived to when we left. Staff are so attentive and  we were extremely well looked after. We visited the spa and had booked massages and we left feeling  completely relaxed and thoroughly pampered.

I am a coeliac with numerous food allergies and dining out can be a challenging experience. This is the safest I have ever felt. Every staff member that I met with knew about all my allergies in advance and were so extremely mindful of them. From lunch after the spa, to the stunning rooftop bar to breakfast the following morning, food was delicious and, more importantly for me, safe to eat. They even checked any drinks that I ordered.
The spa was a similar experience. All products were checked and adjusted to ensure that they were completely safe for me. This enhanced my experience and I could enjoy my time there without any concerns for my health. 

Our entire stay was wonderful. Our room was lovely too, comfy beds and complete silence ensured a peaceful night's sleep. There is quite simply nothing to fault.
I was also surprised by a gift from the hotel in my room upon arrival, a tray of tasty desserts for my birthday, which were again safe for me to eat.  Such a thoughtful touch which added to my whole experience. I do not hesitate to recommend The Marker Hotel. Thank you to all staff who made our stay so memorable. We are already planning our return visit.",5,2021,09,28
206,So good to be back !,"My husband and I visited The Marker hotel this weekend for the first time post Covid ( we had previously stayed a few times and love it there !) my husband was caught up in the unfortunate situation in Kabul recently so this was our first weekend away together in a long time . We just wanted to say Thank you so much for another incredible weekend . Everything was absolutely perfect , for parking our car upon arrival , for a lovely view from our suite , for delightful drinks and cocktails on the rooftop bar , the Spa area is exceptional and so relaxing ! Just thank you for helping us to make more lovely memories in the time we get to spend together . We would in particular like to mention the lovely Alexander and Derek who took the time to check that we were ok and enjoying our stay . The beautiful sunny weather also just made the weekend as an added bonus ! We will most certainly be back soon x",5,2021,09,26
206,Excellent,"The Marker Hotel is absolutely amazing. The professionalism, the service,  the food and the quality of the rooms are unmatched. Perfect for a couple getaway. I would highly highly recommend The Marker Hotel to anyone! Thank ye for an unforgettable few days!",5,2021,09,25
206,Amazing Birthday,"Thank you to all the staff of the Marker hotel, especially the waiter at the Brasserie, gave us an exceptional service for the dinner as well as the reception team Ines and the receptionist who took care of us from start to finish so lovely. Thanks to you I had a wonderful birthday, you managed and were there for us all the time. We are totally satisfied and thank you again for keeping our Rolex cakeüéÇ Fredo, Julie, Nora 24 sept 2021.",5,2021,09,24
206,On the Mark(er) again,"Our second visit to the Marker was just as memorable as our first. The leisure pool area is first class, the residents lounge on the rooftop gives a panoramic view of the area, the location is close to the city, the breakfast is one of the best I‚Äôve ever eaten. Most impressive is the level of service from all the staff - real 5 star stuff, without the stuffiness. We will be back.",5,2021,09,22
206,What a pleasant surprise !!!!!!,"Before Covid I used to be a very regular traveller to Dublin and my preferred hotel in the city has been The Merrion.  Stayed in a few others, but always returned to The Merrion.  This time, my Dublin colleagues and my Assistant suggested that I should try The Marker. First reason for this was that it is located around 5 mins walk from my office, what would make things simpler.  Price was competitive too I must say.  

Stayed 3 nights earlier in the week, and all in all the experience was really good.   Friendly staff, nice room, spotless clean spacious, well equipped, good working wifi, nice espresso machine, comfortable bed. From a dining point of view, had breakfast twice and it was very good. Maybe a bit overpriced but good quality. Also one night had drinks at the bar and all went very well.  One thing to note though is that hotel seemed to be quite empty.  The 2 days I had breakfast, there were just one or two more people at the restaurant and you could hardly see anybody walking around.  I will definitely return in the coming weeks, and hope that they manage to keep the good service and personal attention with higher occupancy levels.

Hotel is located across the street of a square where lots of young people meet to socialize (= drink and listen to music). On two of the nights it was a bit noisy. I had a room on the first floor, so next time will be mindful of asking for a room on a higher floor.   Second minor detail is that coffee capsules for the espresso machine were not replace on my first and third day.  Just minor details, easy to adjust.

In summary, very good experience, nice surprise for me because was my first stay at The Marker and if on my next stays the hotel shows consistency on quality and service I might add it to my list of preferred hotels in Dublin.",5,2021,09,19
206,25th anniversary,"My wife and I have had another unbelievable stay at the Marker Hotel in Dublin. The whole experience was fantastic, from the relaxed atmosphere, great food and drink, the coffee and cocktails at the rooftop bar but most of all the friendly and helpful staff throughout the hotel made this our best break ever. Thank you staff at the Marker",5,2021,09,18
206,Honeymoon,We had a wonderful time at the marker celebrating our honeymoon. The staff were amazing and so accommodating and the room was gorgeous. We had breakfast both mornings and dinner in the hotel bar on the first evening and all were fantastic.,5,2021,09,18
206,Good but could be better,"I PREVIOUSLY WROTE A REVIEW FOR THE MARKER BUT THEY WITTINGLY MOVED THE REVIEW TO A REVIEW OF THE ROOFTOP TERRACE. 

Superb location. The marker is eye catching on the outset. A Porter is ready and waiting to take your bags and greet you with a warm welcome.

Reception team are very professional and friendly, special mention for Gabriele.

The bar was great, well trained and outgoing staff. Bedrooms I found quite underwhelming and generic to be perfectly honest. I have stayed in some lesser ranked hotels whose bedrooms have a lot more character.

The spa and pool areas were wonderfully clean, inviting and well managed in the sense of not becoming overly busy. The spa treatment in particular was knockout- I think the therapists name was Lavina, superstar and very good at her job - thank you !

Dinner the first evening was in the bar - well executed bar food for sure, thank you. Chowder in particular was very good, I requested a lemon wedge to aid the seasoning, what I received was half of a dirty mouldy lemon that was untrimmed. Not even as much as a muslin cover over it - this is not a leading hotel of the world standard.. not even close.

What really disappointed me was that on the Monday evening there was no alternative dining option. Bar food once again was all that was on offer. Honestly in hindsight this is unacceptable. Empathy may be granted to many properties suffering with staff shortages etc after the pandemic, but this is a leading hotel of the world folks - they charge for that plaque outside the door alone! And only bar food on offer ?! Quite simply not good enough. The club sandwich looked fantastic‚Ä¶

Upon the departure I had half and hour to burn whilst waiting for a taxi. A manager of some description kindly offered me a complimentary coffee on the terrace, which I had not yet visited. I obliged and I was shown the way via the lift. Superb spot overlooking Dublin, would of been much nicer with a coffee though, there was no staff member present. I waited 10 minutes or so before heading back down to the lobby and grabbing a coffee there. I had paid my bill, it seems I wasn‚Äôt much important in terms of service after that.

I have stayed at quite a few Leading hotels of the world, and worked with one also. Genuinely I have always thought they are worth it. Here, I would certainly raise an eyebrow to the virtue of the accolade. 

Breakfast both mornings were efficient and well cooked - thank you.

Overall my stay was fine, the staff were great. Would I stay again ? Go spend similar money elsewhere and watch it go further. There are 5 or 6 LHWs in Ireland.. this is bottom of the barrel.",3,2021,09,13
206,Perfect,"When your expectations are high - and after several previous visits here they were - it can be all too easy to be disappointed, even if only slightly.

No way.  It has been perfect. Arrived Friday  for three nights - Staff, food, room, spa, courtesy . . . all top notch.  It has been some two years since getting 'home' to Ireland due to Covid. So pleased to be back. 

I cannot recommend enough. In fact, maybe I should say nothing and keep the secret!

Many thanks to ALL the staff.  Jim",5,2021,09,13
206,Can‚Äôt wait to go back to the Marker!,"Got back from Dublin last week and didn‚Äôt have the chance to write my review about The Marker Hotel.
I would like to take my time and write our experience at The Marker.

ALL staff were very professional and kind. I would like to give a shout-out to the reception attendants during my checkin. Andrea and Viola were exceptional; greeted me with so much love, professionalism and respect and then we had the pleasure to meet Aman and Ines that were also very attentive to our needs. 
Grace at the breakfast restaurant was exceptional!! I had asked her if I can order a loaf of soda bread to take back with me to Canada; she made sure that I got it the day before we travelled. Thank you Grace!

Derek, the security that ushered us to the rooftop was amazing. My husband and I were very happy when we had forgotten to reserve our table on the rooftop and asked Derek if it was possible to get a table and apologize; he made us feel so much at ease and said as guests at the hotel, you always have a spot. Thank you Dereküëèüèª

I would like to give a shout-out to Laszlo and Kenneth were exceptional as well; thank you for all you did for us 
As well as the staff on the rooftop.

My husband and I look forward to going back and build even better memories together.
I congratulate the management at the Marker to have hired such amazing staff. 
Sincerely 
Mrs. A",5,2021,09,12
206,Weekend away,"I‚Äôve been waiting years to experience this hotel! I feel it is is highly overrated for the prices . The room (411) was very conferencey with a poor view so I rang reception and asked for an upgrade. I was given an identical room with a slightly better view. We were here for the all Ireland and  I was shocked that there was no showing of it in the bar, there was , however a TV set up In a small conference room that seated maybe 6. I feel that a 5 star in Dublin should have a better facility on all Ireland weekend. 
Dinner was delicious, the prawn ü¶ê starter was the nicest I‚Äôve ever tasted! Hats off to the chef , and to all the staff , each one was above and beyond attentive. The restaurant was closed ‚Äúdue to covid‚Äù so we had to eat dinner in the reception area which really lacks atmosphere . I don‚Äôt understand why the restaurant is closed due to covid but we could eat breakfast in that area? 
The en suite is beautiful , the service is excellent. But the room and general facilities are lacking bigtime. And my big bugbear is an Irish coffee - any decent Dublin hotel should have their staff well trained  to make a delicious Irish coffee.",3,2021,09,11
206,Exceptional,"Spent bank holiday weekend here. Very impressed. Good communication prior to arrival with regard to special requests etc for our daughters 13th birthday. Everything went exactly as we had requested. Room was lovely. Ample space for family of 4 and nice touches - champagne (for us!) and brownie etc for daughters birthday. Teepee was lovely. Rooftop bar is special- we had drinks on both evenings. Pool area spotlessly clean and relaxing. What made this place exceptional was the staff. From the doorman to check in to waiting staff to the guy who checked us in for the rooftop bar, everyone was happy and chatty and helpful. They had shared info about the birthday and that shows a high performing team. They went the extra mile. Even charged my ecar for going home! We will be back.",5,2021,09,10
206,Fantastic stay!,"This hotel really is 5 star in every aspect. The service was just out of this world from start to finish - would love to give a special mention to Gabriele at the front desk who went out of her way to make sure we were taken care of! The entire hotel was extremely clean, felt very safe (in all aspects) with a spacious corner suite and beautiful breakfast. I will highly recommend this hotel to all friends and family and can't wait to return in future! ",5,2021,09,08
206,1st class service and experience,"We had a great experience from the moment we arrived at the hotel. We had let them know in advance that we had just gotten married, and upon welcome staff congratulated us. Also at dinner this evening a different member of staff Scott also congratulated us aswell. We were treated so well, and had received complimentary glasses of bubbles with our dinner and also had sweet treats left in our room. This thoughtfulness was very appreciated. Staff couldn‚Äôt have been more courteous, and we would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2021,09,08
206,Can't wait to return,"Excellent experience overall and the staff are a credit to the Hotel. 
Myself and my husband had a lovely stay and we look forward to returning to The Marker in Dublin.

206,Luxury Hotel,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this hotel.  We loved the extremely comfortable bed and pillows.  It was like sleeping on a cloud!  Plus, the room was super quiet.  The rooftop terrace was lovely except for the chain smokers beside us.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The messages at the spa were fantastic.  Make sure you book well in advance.  Most importantly, they took extra measures to keep everyone safe during this pandemic.",5,2021,09,07
206,The hotel is SUPERB but phone ahead to see if there are any functions on midweek if you‚Äôre on business trip,"Hotel- Stunning. Staff- attentive and professional. Facilities- excellent. So what went wrong? Other guests. There was a sort of wedding happening - this was Wednesday. What I could decipher amidst the clouds of cigarette smoke and swearing this was a covid wedding that had been cancelled many times so I thought ah what the heck they deserve they‚Äôre night of fun. I didn‚Äôt feel this way at 1am when the party moved from the verandas into the bedrooms. Screaming, swearing, slamming doors and music could be heard throughout my floor. I complained to the front desk numerous times - but the staff can really only ask you to pipe down so many times 
Upon checkout the next day I complained again, but it‚Äôs not the hotels fault. I was discounted some of the cost of my stay which was very generous- you can‚Äôt really predict the behavior of guests. I would definitely try stay here again - but I might just call ahead to make sure there are no midweek weddings or whatever that was! üòÇ",4,2021,09,02
206,Nice Hotel,"Lovely hotel, food is fabulous, plenty of options and nice outdoor seating available. Good adherence to covid guidelines, we felt safe and secure. Convenient parking however would have liked a valet service which wasn't offered. Felt the staff were very cold and unwelcoming.",5,2021,09,02
206,"Wow, service at another level! 28th-30th August","We have been lucky enough to stay in some fabulous Hotels and the Marker is up there with the best. From arrival to departure the staff made us feel at home and nothing too much trouble. We visited some of the other 5 star Hotels in Dublin and felt we had made the right choice, the Marker felt more modern with a greater feeling of space.  Highlights:
(a) Rooftop bar - we ate here the first night expecting to eat somewhere else the second night but the service, food, value for money and overall experience ensured we rebooked the 2nd night. It also appears drinks for guests are FOC  (certainly coffee and soft drinks) until 3pm, an added special touch
(b) Service Level. The Hotel is modern and had a feel of Dubai about it (we even had the sun over the weekend!). Niceties such as remembering your name made the stay feel so special and welcoming. All the staff looked and felt happy and nothing too much trouble. We experienced a slight glitch but was rectified in an unbelievable manner by Nutu and his staff (a special thanks to Nutu who is the Senior Hotel Manager, exemplary service level whose attitude seems to permeate through all the staff)
(c) Spa - Pool and facilities amazing 
(d) Breakfast - fantastic choice and service
(e) Bedroom - the bed is so comfy and large room
(f) Concierge - great team, right from arrival when they park your car until they bring it to the front when you leave. A great, knowledgeable and helpful team
(g) Location - 15 minute walk to Grafton Street and right on the waterfront gives it a continental feel, also the size of the Hotel gives a feeling of space but also intimacy
(h) Lift operators, they even have guys to press the buttons in the elevator for you!

Look forward to staying again next time we visit Dublin, thank you for making our stay so welcoming.

206,Birthday celebration,"Just returned from a most memorable  stay  with our family in this exquisite hotel. We were celebrating our daughter‚Äòs birthday and prior to our stay I had made contact  saying we were celebrating her birthday. From the moment we set foot the hospitality was outstanding and made such a fuss of the birthday girl. The room was so luxurious and spacious and a beautiful surprise of macarons and bottle of a beautiful sparkling wine and a beautiful cake awaited us. The level of  professionalism and hospitality was outstanding. We had booked cocktails on the rooftop  but alas it was not to be due to torrential rain , but again the staff  rose to the challenge and had cocktails downstairs. Did I mention the cocktails were to die for ü•≥ The icing on the cake was meeting  Garrett Mullins the  head chef of the hotel (I have been a fan of his cuisine for ages).  He took time out and gave us a guided tour of the rooftop bar and more cakes for the birthday girl Thank you Garrett for making the birthday girl  feel so special . Without hesitation I would highly recommend staying at this  amazing hotel. I  so look forward to returning and soaking up  the great vibe and buzz. To all the wonderful staff , Go raibh mile Maith agat",5,2021,08,26
206,"Amazing experience, would highly recommend staying in the hotel!","Amazing stay in a beautiful hotel. Every single staff member was so friendly and helpful. Barbara in the spa was super and the complimentary OJ and sorbet in the relaxation area was a nice surprise. We had a lovely dinner in the bar,  the rooftop terrace was stunning and breakfast was great. The room was excellent and the chocolates in the room were delicious. The entire hotel adhered to all covid-19 hygiene practices. I would 100% recommend the hotel to anyone thinking of staying!",5,2021,08,20
206,40th Birthday Treat,"Took my husband here as part of his 40th Birthday Celebrations.
The hotel did not disappoint.
Everything was very smooth from check in-check out. 
Room was Spacious and had lovely views over the Grand Canal in The Docklands.
Staff so attentive and felt very safe with Covid precautions in place. 
Breakfast was a real treat. Cannot wait to return hopefully in the not to distant future. ",5,2021,08,19
206,Amazing experience,"We visited the hotel on Saturday for food and drinks. We had a reservation for the roof top but due to the weather we were offered seating in the outdoor bar at the front of the hotel. 
We were slightly disappointed as we booked this several weeks ago but this wasn‚Äôt the fault of the hotel. 

From the moment we arrived, our waitress, Keimberly was very attentive. The service we received was flawless. She was enthusiastic, kind and considerate. I feel like she added to our experience. 

The food was gorgeous. We had the prawn starter and the Beef and Bordeaux. Everything was full of flavour and mouth watering. 
We can‚Äôt wait to return. 

Highly recommend :)",5,2021,08,16
206,"A symbiosis of good service, friendliness, modern design and comfort","An excellent hotel. I never do reviews but in this case I had to as it was so perfect! You really get spoilt. I would recommend this to everyone who wants to visit Dublin - either for sightseeing or for business. I will definitely choose it the next time. 
",5,2021,08,15
206,Perfection in the middle of Dublin,From the moment we arrived until we left we were made to feel special. It's the attention to detail that set this hotel apart from others we have stayed in. The staff were helpful.and friendly from the front desk to restaurants to the lift operator. I booked this for my wife's 40th and it didn't disappoint,5,2021,08,10
206,Extraordianry home away from home experience,"The staff of the Marker Hotel treated us like family from arrival to the moment of our departure. We are experienced travelers and this was the best hotel experience ever! The entire staff was courteous and competent. Made us feel like we were the only guests in the hotel and always greeted us by name. The lead concierge, Lazlo  especially made sure we were well taken care of each day with lovely restaurant recommendations. He arranged for a day long private tour guide with Brian O'Reilly who was an incredibly  warm and knowledgeable fellow (highly recommend him). The day tour with Brian was one of the true highlights of our trip. The staff even made arrangements for convenient  Covid  travel testing right in the hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Marker and when we return to Dublin, we will be sure to stay there again.",5,2021,08,08
206,Nice hotel,This was a nice hotel with lovely staff and great food and fabulous bedrooms. Just a couple of things they need to improve on. There was no proper smoking area only outside the door of the hotel. In my opinion that looks bad for a 5 star hotel even though I am a smoker myself. The next thing was 17 euro for a glass of prosecco. That in my opinion was shocking. I did mention to one of the staff they need to get a middle of the road prosecco for 8 or 9 euro a glass. I understand its 5 star but you should have the choice like you would have with whiskeys etc. It was beautiful brut sparkling in a tall glass but I don't agree with that price. Everything else was lovely.,4,2021,08,08
206,Amazing hotel with friendly Staff,Amazing hotel with friendly helpful Staff who couldnt do enough for you. Nice experience definitely would return and would recommend a trip to the Spa. Cleanliness of room bathroom and hotel was 10/10.,5,2021,08,03
206,Beautiful stay for couples,"Just an overall amazing stay. Right from the moment you enter the hotel, you are greeted with true 5 star service. Every member of staff has a real eagerness to make you feel welcome and taken care of. From the concierge to the bar staff right the way to management. We could not have asked for a better stay. We had booked the rooftop bar for drinks, but unfortunately due to weather it was closed. We then were told by the restaurant manager that if we asked the night security ""Derek"", that he would love to show us the bar later that night. This did not dissappoint and was arguably the highlight of our whole weekend. Dereks love for his city and his job was just a breath of fresh air. He explained the history of the hotel and surrounding areas, all while engaging with us and bringing my girlfriend a blanket. 

The food, drink, staff, spa and room were all truly magnificent. We will definitely be returning at some stage.",5,2021,08,03
206,"Amazing stay, will be returning","Stayed in the Marker for one night with family. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we had a five star experience. I loved the location, the architecture and the design of the hotel. The rooms were great and the bathroom in particular was fabulous - the underfloor heating was a lovely touch. The food at breakfast and lunch were both great and the bar had a good drinks selection. We all thought the spa was top class - our massages were amazing, the pool area  was very nice and spotless as were the spa changing rooms. 
The best part of our trip was definitely the staff - they were so attentive, efficient and friendly. The doormen in particular were very welcoming and helpful. Unfortunately the rooftop bar was closed the evening we were staying but the security guard kindly brought us up to show us the views of Dublin at night and told us about the architecture of the hotel and history of the Docklands area. The next day after checkout another doorman brought us up to the rooftop bar again where we had complimentary tea and coffee and were able to see the amazing views during the day. I thought this was a great touch as we were still treated as guests even after checkout. 
We had a great stay and will be returning. Kudos to the staff!",5,2021,08,02
206,Good Hotel but poor allergen accommodation in restaurant.,"We stayed overnight in The Marker as we had a late afternoon meeting locally and decided to treat ourselves with something special.
The Hotel is a Tier One accommodation in a relatively new part of the city, but still only a 20 min walk to Grafton St shopping. The area its situated in is young, dynamic and a mixture of modern online business and modern apartments with plenty of infrastructure to support it. Its adjacent to a new Theatre showing big productions.
Inside the Hotel the reception lobby is modern, stylish and has a light / airy feel about it.
The room we stayed in on Level 4 was also modern, plush, funky, with a luxurious bathroom. Lots of new types of charging points and an well stocked coffee machine.
The corridors are very quiet and stylish with a dark theme.
We didn‚Äôt get to see the spa or pool area as it was 9.30 pm and was closing for the evening.
We dined on the roof terrace and were not disappointed with its setting and views. Although many ants enjoy the terrace too.
Breakfast was served on the ground floor and again it has a lovely contemporary feel about it.
Staff at Reception are very security conscious and Covid compliance aware, and are well trained in marshalling and shepherding guests to their restaurant, spa  or room. This may create an edge of discomfort though as it may feel if one is being watched almost.
Staff in general terms are more than helpful and polite.
Parking is by Valet at the front door, although if it‚Äôs raining outside you will need an umbrella to get back to your vehicle even if its parked near the front door for you on departure.
Breakfast was a nice experience served by a lovely waitress Caroline. 
It was disappointing though to read that Eggs Benidict are and additional 8 Euro charge to the Bed and Breakfast rate. Not too sure if the description of freshly squeezed orange juice was in fact true.
Dinner the evening before was served for us on the chilled out terrace area. A wonderful setting.
If one is gluten intolerant this may not be the place to expect a wide choice from the menu.
Despite the best efforts from our servers Beibhinn and Scott who are a credit to the Hotel, it was a surprisingly disappointing outcome. The terrace restaurant menu, the allergen menu and even the bar menu from downstairs were presented for a GF choice. The chef was contacted and even that could not resolve the lack of available dishes to suit a customer whom is Gluten Intolerant. In the end a compromise was reached by removing parts of each course dish that had gluten in it. Surely there has got to be more than Salad, Steak, and Seafood for GF choices. No effort or imagination was used for GF choices. No dessert was GF that evening. The food that was presented was delicious and well prepared.
I don‚Äôt think I am being fussy when mentioning the above allergan issues experienced as we have been in Hotels and Restaurants where the whole menu was GF. One hotel is less the 100m away from this location. For a tier one  5 star hotel, it is not acceptable to not have reasonable dietary alternatives. For this reason we cannot return or recommend and I can only state the hotel is only very good, but not excellent.",4,2021,07,31
206,Excellent Hotel,"Service from the first second to the last was as good as it gets. Old world charm and elegance didn‚Äôt prevent them installing rooms with more usb sockets than I‚Äôve seen in the most high tech hotels. Also euro plug as well as standard Irish ones and usb at desk. Food in the lounge bar better than at lot of restaurants and not overly expensive. Do try espresso martini...Vegan breakfast a delight as was the service that went with it. Would like to mention 3 people who I have personally dealt with on my stay, Karoline, Andrea and Derek....stars of the hotel...good city centre location and mins walk from liffey...highly recommended.",5,2021,07,16
206,Brilliant,"Friendliest staff, amazing service. 

Food and drinks were delicious and the view of the rooftop bar was beautiful.

Exquisite breakfast, best scrambled eggs ive had in a hotel. 

Valet service worth it due to location 

Gym and spa are very well equiped ",5,2021,07,14
206,Friendly staff and efficient management!,"One of the finest hotels in Dublin. Very efficient staff and the management team. Delighted with my stay there. All the amenities were spotless as is expected from a 5 star property. 
The staff were aware of all the covid protocols which put us at ease. The breakfast chef offered to make us a vegan breakfast. Absolutely delightful! Highly recommend!",5,2021,07,13
206,Excellent service all round - truly 5*!,"Recently, we were fortunate enough to secure a booking in the rooftop bar of the Marker Hotel. Having arrived in sunshine, we were greeted at the rooftop host desk by the amazing Derek. He made us feel most welcome, which made our journey to the rooftop seamless, pleasant and definitely memorable. During our wait for the lift, Derek made use aware of the delights that awaited us on the rooftop in regards to ambiance, service and sights we would see as it was our first time to come to the rooftop! and by god did he not disappoint. 
Upon reaching the rooftop, we received excellent service, particularly by Aisling. She was ever so attentive, we never had to look for the attention of any other members of the team as Aisling was on the ball and anticipated our needs before we even knew what we needed! Her kindness and talents are Truly out of this world. 
We had beautiful cocktails and sumptious foods. 
Rachel the manager checked on us constantly to ensure we were being looked after. As we were enjoying ourselves so much, we stayed late into the evening and it started to get a bit nippy out, however Rachel and her team were well prepared and had some blankets on standby to give to us which I thought was a really nice touch. 
I can‚Äôt commend Rachel and her staff enough for the amazing job they are doing on the rooftop. It‚Äôs Truly a 5* experience and we will definitely return!

206,Great stay,"Stayed in the Marker with friends last night and from Orla on reception to Caroline our server we were treated with 5 star service.

The pool is fab and with the roof top bar and restaurant you would think you were anywhere in the world.

Loved our stay and definitely will be back.",4,2021,06,28
206,"Great hotel, friendly and helpful staff!","Myself and my boyfriend stayed in the marker hotel last night, from start to finish the service provided by the staff was amazing. Every single person we talked to was so helpful and attentive, especially Klarissa our waitress- she was amazing!!! The only thing we were let down with was being unable to order more than one drink at last orders (11pm) to bring back to the room. Other than this, breakfast, dinner and drinks were fab & we had a great stay. The room was immaculate including the bathroom, pool and jacuzzi were gorgeous. Thanks so much for a great well needed break!",4,2021,06,19
206,Incredible service,"Had such a great experience this past week.

The food, the drinks and especially the service. The staff were the best part of this great experience, would like to highlight Adam, our server, and his contributions - he made the night. His cocktail recommendations were spot on. 

I will most certainly be returning. ",5,2021,06,12
206,Fab,"Stayed for one night with dinner package. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The spa was really nice and clean, had a massage which was excellent. Rooms were average, disappointed there was no bath. Over all lovely hotel but a little exspencive. ",4,2021,06,12
206,Excellent stay. Would highly recommend,"Everything about a stay in the marker was perfect. You can pick holes in anything if you want but for me this is a wonderful hotel. The staff are top class. So helpful and respectful of guests. Was disappointed the rooftop bar was not open but we visited in December and I had been previously informed at booking.
Would certainly recommendand and re-visit",5,2020,12,18
206,Business Trip,Very good is a little bit expensive but you get what you pay for and this is one of the best Hotels in Ireland. Rooms are very big and the bathrooms are amazing. If you want a fantastic surprise for your other half this hotel would give you the wow factor,5,2020,12,18
206,Very helpful Morning Staff ,"I didn't like leaving a previous negative review but I felt it had to be done, in saying that a positive review needs to be left for the Morning staff especially Fernando who was very considerate and empathetic and extremely professional.My girlfriend had to go to work straight from hotel and instead of paying for taxi Fernando organised a courtesy car for her. Also he did leave us feeling valued customers by giving us a lovely wrapped Christmas Pudding.He knew I was going to gym and told me to enjoy my time there. That sounds small but it makes you feel good when you hear it. I'm sure if Fernando knew about Katies birthday yesterday evening things might have been different. ",4,2020,12,16
206,The Great Escape!,"Just home from fabulous 24 hour stay in The Marker.
Such an oasis in the current climate. From the warm, professional welcome upon arrival through to tasty lunch, pre dinner cocktails on the Rooftop Terrace and delicious dinner in Restaurant - Bliss! Every member of staff was friendly and attentive, down to providing small details like warm blankets and outdoor heaters. Didn‚Äôt have time to enjoy the Spa and Pool area but saving that for next visit. Very high levels of COVID compliance throughout.
Dara, Franco & entire team thank you !!",5,2020,12,13
206,Another excellent stay,"Stayed for the 2nd time just city escape after the 2nd lockdown. I have to stay they really deliver an exceptional experience! Staff are very friendly and amazing facilities in the spa, though they are busy but the staff were really helpful to find us a slot. Book in advance if you want to go to the pool. Stunning views of Dublin from the rooftop and the doorman gives you a true taste of the area and always up for a chat, truly Irish! There is always someone to look after you at reception and nothing is ever a hassle. Will definitely return here soon. ",5,2020,12,09
206,Superb location for Dublin City break ,"The location is incredible just 1km from Trinity College and 2km from main shopping areas.
Rooftop bar is a cool feature but was absolutely freezing, worth going up for a drink and the view.
Breakfast was fantastic with great service from staff throughout stay. ",5,2020,12,07
206,Good Stay spoilt with not being able to order a Glass of wine with lunch.,"We recently stayed in the Marker Hotel, in fact we were the second guest to arrive after the covid lockdown. In total we spent near on 2,000 euros over our time with the hotel. 

 I have now just checked out and I am currently in the restaurant, ordering soup and chips for lunch along with a glass of wine, I have been told this is not a substantial¬†enough meal to order a wine.¬†Now I am a small person, who says that isn't enough food for me. Its two items of the menu ! 

My complaint here is that on arrival we were served wine, throughout our time here we have been served alcohol. I¬†am still following guidelines by ordering food of 9 euros, however I am now told I can't have a glass of wine as the meal is not enough not in terms of money but in terms of the amount of food.¬†

You can understand my frustration¬†at this situation, the fact we have spent a lot of money over our time here and to then to checkout and be treated this way obviously puts distaste on the whole stay here at The Marker Hotel.¬†¬†

Ordering a more substantial¬†meal does not stop the spread of covid and¬†I feel after staying in the hotel there should be a level of flexibility, I was happy enough to follow guidelines and order food but just not a full meal as this would have been wasteful. 

We would have returned if this had not been the case, but now after being treated this way it makes you think are you really a valued guest!?  I think not!!",1,2020,12,04
206,The best in Dublin,"I have been visiting the Marker for several years now (and I am local!!) for several reasons: the fabulous property itself, the Rooftop, the wine dinners, the food and drink are sublime AND of course the wonderful staff. It‚Äôs easy to get to know the staff, who are as friendly and fun as they are professional and polished. They are beyond warm and lovely. The rooms and public areas are stunningly appointed and the pool area is a perfect escape from the bustle of the City. My favourite summer retreat in Dublin is the rooftop bar - it is honestly the best spot In Dublin when the sun shines. Hope to enjoy many more happy memories at The Marker.",5,2020,11,06
206,Really wonderful,"This hotel is amazing, definitely the best in Dublin.The room was spacious and spotlessly clean. The pool area was great, especially the huge jacuzzi. Breakfast was fantastic, probably the best I remember in any hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful without being too intrusive. Nikki at reception was wonderful, she really made me feel welcome, first impressions are always important and I knew I had made a great choice to stay here, when Nikki checked me in. I also have to mention Grace who worked in the spectacular roof top restaurant, she was so friendly, efficient and even took the time to point out some landmarks.",5,2020,10,12
206,Amazing hotel,"Marker Hotel
I just wanted to write a quick note to say Thank you very much for a fabulous evening. My self and my partner stayed with you on Saturday night and your staff were truly amazing. It really made my birthday celebrations.  Service was above and beyond. All the staff were lovely and attentive. And I enjoyed the late check out on Sunday. 

Your covid precautions, preventatives and social distancing where implanted very well and put our mind at ease through out our stay, the food and cocktails were devine . We finished our night on the roof top bar. 

The Best thing about our stay were the staff and their personal touch. Friendly, accommodating, sociable, courteous, generous. I can‚Äôt stress highly enough how much they made our night. I hope this is recognised by management of the hotel. Your staff will be the  reason my self and my partner continue to come back to your hotel. One stand out is Fernando. He really did everything he could to make sure our stay was comfortable and secure. I'd like to thank Fernando for making our first trip away in a long time one to remember. He is a credit to the hotel.

206,Best of Dublin you'll find there,"Went in The Marker long time before Covid happened and enyojed fabolous views from the rooftop terrace garden, great meal and delicious cocktails. Never stayed in hotel, as I'm Dublin's  resident, but for modern, quirky and stylish 5* tourist - this is a place to go. Firstly it's built in the most beautiful part of Dublin (Docklands), secondly it has the most beautiful design (indoor, outdoor), thirdly their service, quality and taste of food & cocktails, extraordinary trained staff - will blow your mind. Location is Dublin2 -  between 3Arena and Dublin convention centre from one and City centre (Grafton, Coledge Green, Temple Bar from the other side. When booking always go through hotel website, never use the ota, as you'll get the best rate. For theatre lovers, one of the Dublin's best theater venues is next door. Enjoy Marker. ",5,2020,10,10
206,City retreat,"Spent our anniversary here and loved the hotel. Very clean, staff very accommodating and polite. Rooms were lovely and the baths are great for a relaxing soak!

Only downfall is we found the service at dinner and breakfast a little slow. We were waiting awhile for our drinks order at dinner and at breakfast my partner was offered extra breakfast as a substitute twice and it never arrived.

I wouldn't let that put you off though, we would stay again.",4,2020,10,10
206,Perfect stay,"Thank you guys for everything.
We stayed with my husband there and we had the most amazing time ever.

Well done guys!",5,2020,10,06
206,"Clean, great location & honest, attentive and friendly staff","Strict precautions for Covid-19 are practiced at The Marker Hotel with sanitizing stations everywhere, face coverings required to enter. Me husband had a fantastic 60 minute massage with Magda at the spa Monday. He forgot his wedding band in the robe, realized 4 hours after the service. Contacted the hotel and spoke to Christina whom said she'd get right back to him - 10 minutes later she advised the laundry had been taken yet it is done in house so she'd check bac with him. 45 minutes later she said they found the gold band.  Above board service. Great atmosphere and phenomenal massage as well as a sweet treat at the end in a relaxing station - yes a relaxing station after a super relaxing massage!! Thanks you Christina and staff of The Marker Hotel Dublin!!",5,2020,10,01
206,Amazing as per usual,"This was our third visit at the hotel and each and every stay was just as nice.
Our room was very clean and sanitized, with great views and a beautiful bathroom.
We enjoyed a lovely dinner and delicious breakfast in our room.
On our last day we enjoyed a late check out which was great after the time spent at the spa and health club. Diana and Alejandra's massages were very nice and relaxing, would highly recommend both!
Would like to say thank you to Tony who looked after our reservation and helped me with booking everything prior to our stay.
All the staff that looked after us from reception, restaurant and spa were very helpful and welcoming, thank you to all!:)
I am so pleased that my partner had such a nice birthday, despite the current situation, and will definitely return soon!",5,2020,09,29
206,Outstanding,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay in The Marker. Best thing about it was the staff. Friendly, accommodating, sociable, courteous, generous and engaging is only tipping the iceberg on how lovely everyone in the hotel was to us. Big thank you to Rachel for looking after us so well in the upstairs bar, as well as Fernando for the lovely table and service. All the staff up there were 100% lovely and attentive. Thanks to Monica for her time and management of our requests. We had a perfect check in with Orla, check out with Aaron and tailoring of our requests to pool and spa by Darragh and Fernando again. There are so many other lovely staff and the hotel is testimony to their hard work. Not forgetting Thalia and the recommendation on the cinnamon whiskey cocktails. 

The hotel is a unique design and for a narrow building it is immaculately appointed with all the elegance, modernity and charm expected from a 5 star experience. The food was very good, the only feedback is that the ‚Äòbutchers surprise‚Äô cut of beef was the weakest meal we had there. This purely because we did not like the cut of meat. The chicken satay, mozzarella salad, lamb kofta, fish and chips, prawn linguini, beef burger and breakfast are delicious. 

COVID-19 supports, preventatives and social distancing are immaculately executed. 

We throughly recommend the hotel to anyone looking to escape for a period of time. We had a late check out with 2 nights stay and felt completely relaxed after. We don‚Äôt live too far away so we will be back soon for a day visit and would only love to be guests again. Thank you Team Marker! ",5,2020,09,21
206,Fantastic!!,"I rang The Marker last Friday to arrange a room for 2 adults, 2 children and a baby and spoke to Nicky who was lovely, so helpful.  She arrange an upgrade for us for a corner suite with a large double bed and sofa bed for the kids. It was simple, booked in about 5 mins! On arrival then we meet a lovely guy who parked our car for us.  We were early so we went to the terrace for some bar food for lunch,. It was just lovely. Fab food and very reasonably priced for a 5 star hotel in Dublin. The staff again were lovely. 

After a walk around the city we checked into our amazing corner suite! Just loved it.  The views of Grand Canal Quay square were amazing! The sun was shinning, all was good.  The bed was so comfy. Bathroom and toiletries were fab. The room was quiet. Just lovely. 

We had booked for swimming at 8:15 slot for an hour. The swimming pool is amazing as well. Just loved it.  There was a jacuzzi too.  Then we had a fantastic breakfast served at our table in the restaurant beside the lobby.  Staff there were just lovely as well. Loads of excellent food.  The chef even came over to our table to say hello. They were all so nice to our children as well :) 

Overall, a lovely time and we all can't wait to go back.. Thank you to Nicky, Kenneth, Orla and the rest of the staff there.  It's the people who make a place. Fantastic staff. A credit to The Marker Hotel :)",5,2020,09,16
206,This is Different Class,"Outside and inside, the hotel is an aesthetic masterpiece. It perfectly balances contemporary luxury with its abstract designs.   

The staff are second to none. Competent, knowledgeable and extremely helpful with a warm demeanor.

I had a corner suite for the night. Beautiful room with an amazing view of the docks. The black marble in the bathrooms is a stunning touch. 

We had reservations on the rooftop bar. Absolutely beautiful views and we were lucky enough to catch the sunset. Very comfortable seating and were spotlessly maintained along with the tables. I had a particular drink for the night in mind, but noticed it was not on the menu. I asked the bartenders if they could make a Vodka Martini. Not only did they make it, they were probably the nicest Martinis I've ever had! 

A truly unique experience.",5,2020,09,15
206,Lovely stay,"We had a lovely stay here for three nights. The room was great and had a lovely design. The service service really good from beginning to end. Really made the whole trip so much better. When we come back, we will definitely stay here again. ",5,2020,09,15

Never have I found that every member of staff to be so naturally pleasant and helpful. 
The room was airy spacious and everything you need is there for you. 
The weather was so beautiful during our stay so sitting outside having a pint was sublime. 
We had dinner on the roof terrace. What a incredible view. Heaters were above our table which made it so comfortable as the night went on. 
Food was simple in structure and delicious. 
Well priced and efficiently served with care and warmth. 
Breakfast the next morning was brilliant. Wonderful selection of traditional full Irish. Yoghurt granola, fresh fruit, homemade breads and pastries. Coffee was excellent. 
This was a very Special experience. 
One I will not forget. 
I thank the team for all of your attention.

206,Amazing 5* hotel!,"Stayed here two nights, the night before and of our wedding. We were so impressed with the hotel from the moment we walked in, it is most definitely a 5 star hotel. Staff were lovely and very helpful. The door had a sticker on it to say the room had been cleaned and disinfected, it is definitely the cleanest hotel I‚Äôve ever been to. I was so impressed with the carpet especially, it was one solid colour which usually shows up dirt easily but it was absolutely spotless. There was a sweet treat waiting for us in the room to celebrate our marriage which was lovely. Bed was super comfy and the bathroom was huge, it was fabulous and had lots of counter space. We ordered breakfast to the room and it was delicious both mornings, I wish I got the name of the young Middle Eastern man who brought our breakfast to the room on the second morning as he went above and beyond checking that we had everything we could need for breakfast. We had dinner in the hotel both nights, very attentive staff and great food. Special mention to Monika who was very attentive and pleasant, she brought us out a dessert to celebrate our marriage which was lovely and unexpected. Salich actually served us both evenings, once in the bar and the other on the rooftop, he was lovely too. We asked for a bucket of ice both nights and we received them within 10 mins each time. We parked our car in the underground car park which was only accessible via a door around the corner outside the hotel but it was easy to get the ticket validated by reception and then just paid on checkout. On checkout Caitriona was very friendly and ensured to check on how our stay was. We‚Äôll definitely be back for our first anniversary, if not before!",5,2020,09,14
206,Best hotel in Dublin!,"Stayed 2 nights in Sep 2020. Service was outstanding from start to finish. We were greeted at the door who kindly brought our bags to our room. We arrived early as we had a spa booking and were allowed check in to our room early. We were upgraded to a beautiful room with king bed and a stunning bathroom. All staff went above and beyond to make our stay as enjoyable as possible and all Covid restrictions were handled with ease. We could not fault the location, everything is on your doorstep while being away from the madness of central Dublin City. We ate in Charlotte quay across the canal and the supermarket fresh was also very useful. We have no complaints and can‚Äôt wait to return to the marker!",5,2020,09,13
206,Relaxing weekend,"Highly recommended this hotel. The design of the hotel is fabulous.
All staff excellent.
Food excellent.
Cleaning services excellent.
Spa excellent highly recommended the massages any of them.
Rooms were spotless.
Rooftop bar has class views and food lovely.
Can't wait to return.
Plus felt safe in regards to COVID19.
",5,2020,09,09
206,Excellent Visit in the heart of Dublin,Myself and my partner stayed before Christmas in the Marker hotel and from arrival we were greeted with friendly and extremely helpful staff. They went above and beyond for every request we had and their manager Leon was so accommodating we‚Äôre already looking at returning to the hotel. The rooftop bar has the best views in Dublin and the food in the hotel was 10/10 for both of us. Thank you to all the staff at the marker for making our stay so easy and enjoyable.,5,2020,09,06
206,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed for my son‚Äôs birthday at The Marker and the whole experience from start to finish was true 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è, the staff were so attentive and professional with a genuine warmth to ensure we enjoying our stay. They heard it was our son‚Äôs birthday and made such a big fuss and made him feel so special. The hotel offers an amazing product as you‚Äôd expect from a 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è but it‚Äôs also great value too that you always don‚Äôt get with a 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è experience.
Can‚Äôt wait to return and special thanks to Andrea Duty Manager who made us feel so welcome üòÅ",5,2020,09,05
206,Amazing,"The Marker hotel truly delivers exceptional service. The hotel is not so far from town, it took us 10 minutes on foot to get to O‚ÄôConnell bridge. The decor and design is amazing with rooftop being the best place to have a drink. We will certainly be back.
",5,2020,09,04
206,Friendliest staff ever!,"The hotel really is amazing, I‚Äôve stayed in many places and I have to say The Marker is up at the top of my list to go back to. The staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for us and our children, I was slightly concerned it may not be ‚Äòfamily friendly‚Äô as such but I was totally wrong. My babies enjoyed it as much as I did!",5,2020,09,04
206,A Lovely One Night Stay ,"I was so glad that the Marker lived up to its reputation. Everything is spotlessly clean, service is professional and welcoming and food/drinks were all lovely. We used the Spa facilities before dinner, unfortunately it was too windy to eat at the rooftop bar but we got to venture up the next morning. Would totally recommend for a one night staycation treat. ",5,2020,08,31
206,The Marker never lets us down. 10‚≠êÔ∏è,"We have stayed at the marker several times and it never fails us. From booking the hotel maintained excellent communication and organised car parking at the hotel. Throughout the hotel they have went above expectation on covid controls with floor markings, sanitiser and screens throughout. Staff are wearing masks or visors which makes you feel safe. I thought the individual guest packs of masks and sanitiser a fantastic idea.
The room had a seal sticker on the door post sanitising. We had a lovely upgrade with a view over grand canal square. The spa was well organised and you need to book your time slot. The max occupancy was well planned and we felt comfortable in the area.
We had dinner in the hotel both evenings and service was great. The prawn and chilli pasta could have had more chilli and lemon and the curry could have had more spice. Just personal preference perhaps but would make these really delicious. 
We had room service breakfast and service was wonderful with staff in PPE coming to the room.
We enjoyed our late checkout and we look forward to returning to the marker really soon. Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2020,08,29
206,Absolutely Lovely,"I have stayed a couple of times at the Marker earlier this month as we decided not to go abroad this year. We went once as a couple for 2 nights and then we went for another 2 night visit with our child. I was nervous about Covid and increasing cases but The Marker has put in place very possible measure to ensure guest safety and I felt completely at ease. It is spacious, well organised and rooms are sealed once they have been cleaned until occupants arrive. Dining tables are thoroughly sanitised when occupants leave. Food at the bar was lovely and breakfast was excellent. Most especially, it was a real pleasure to enjoy the hospitality of each and every one of the staff we interacted with from the moment we arrived. They were friendly, professional and worked very hard to ensure everything was perfect - and it was. Well done and thank you.",5,2020,08,27
206,Hospitality in This place is amazing !,"This hotel is amazing from star to finish ‚ù§Ô∏è Beautiful Rooms, amazing Service, Spa is good and relaxing , tasty food and cocktails ... would recommend to everybody. Looking forward to come back üíØ. Thanks to everyone in Marker hotel, You made as feel special üçíü§©",5,2020,08,22
206,The perfect escape!,"'Whatever you do, do it well.  Do it so well that they will want to come back and see you do it again and they will want to bring others and show them how well you do what you do"" Walt Disney- I recently stayed for a mid week break with my two daughters. The staff at this spotlessly clean hotel managed to create the most relaxing atmosphere while implementing extremely hygienic processes ensuring the safety of all.  Within minutes of arriving at the hotel we started to relax.  Check in was seamless and we were provided with all the information we needed to make sure our stay was memorable.  We were shown to our stunning room (again spotless with hygiene seals), settled in and then headed to the spa. It was hard to believe that we were in the city centre - the world outside drifted by, while we emmersed ourselves into total relaxation.  We dined in the Marker Bar and sampled some sensational cocktails!  The menu was perfect for us and the addition of the Equilibrium menu (tasty healthy options) we were all very happy!   We headed  to our room where housekeeping had provided a turn down service.  We sunk into the most comfortable beds and slept soundly with the added luxury of 'fresh air' air conditioning.  While we normally love a hotel buffet breakfast, the table service of all the delicious options did not disappoint. The staff here are exceptional and created a memorable experience for us. We will be back and because they did it so well, we will bring others with us!  ",5,2020,08,20
206,Service sets it apart,"We stayed for a one night getaway as a couple. The location is really lovely in Dublin- it is by the docks with a view out to sea in a very modern rejuvenated area. Decoration is modern and minimal and very nicely done. The staff throughout the hotel were excellent- from the receptionists, concierges, waiters etc. The breakfast was a real treat and our server was so obliging. Beautiful quality of food. Rooftop bar is a fabulous asset to the hotel- particularly if you are lucky with weather like we were. Again food and service were of a very high standard. The pool area is gorgeous with a jacuzzi , sauna and steam room- a real oasis in the middle of the city. My only suggestion would be to add loungers poolside as there were only 2- 4/5 more are needed and there is space. We had a premium view room and it was lovely- very spacious, great view and lots of nice amenities in it. Overall a real treat of a stay and thoroughly recommended. ",5,2020,08,07
206,Perfect for drinks with friends,"We recently had drinks and food in the rooftop bar of the Marker Hotel. The rooftop bar is fabulous with views over the grand canal dock and Dublin City. It is perfect for drinks with friends or pre theatre drinks, as the Bord Gais theatre is right beside the hotel. The cocktail are also delicious. The only thing that let the experience down, ever so slight was the food. While the food was very tasty, the presentation lacked imagination and for the price point the portions were on the small side. Overall tho I'd definitely go back with friends for drinks and enjoy the sun(when we get it).",4,2020,08,02
206,Brilliant stay! ,"Really enjoyed our stay at The Marker. The staff were incredible. At a time when people are unsure if they should travel in their own country, the staff went out of their way to make the experience really enjoyable. From the room service staff, the rooftop bar and check in. It'll be each of those staff that'll help the hotel survive in a time of uncertainty. I hope this is recognised by the owners and management of the hotel. Your staff are the reason you'll continue to have guests come back. One stand out Darragh really done everything he could to make sure our stay was comfortable and secure. I'd like to thank Darragh for making our first trip away in a long time one to remember. You're a credit to the hotel. It had been our first time out since March and his patience and guidance to help with the procedures gave a seamless transition to the """" New normal"". The sanitizer stations were frequent and staff very well practiced with visors and you could see too they made frequent use of the sanitisation which was great to see. Food in the rooftop bar was excellent with everybody well spaced out. The pool is large and well kept with a great time slot space. This actually works really well as you can plan your day knowing the time you can go down. Booking process was simple and well explained by staff. The only thing we'd ask if there could be a way to leave gratituity for staff like the porters, in room service and cleaning staff. We've not used cash in a few months but wanted to thank them. Thank you again to the Marker for our great stay. We will be back again! ",5,2020,08,02
206,Absolutely fabulous!!,"Myself and my sister recently visited The Marker Hotel. We would give it 10 stars if we could! On hearing that my sister was working for the Frontline, the Hotel very kindly upgraded us for our three night staff. We couldn‚Äôt fault a thing (apart from the fact we had to leave)! The staff truly went above and beyond in every regard. A special mention must go to Orla at the Front Desk and Sandra who greeted and served us breakfast every day. They really delivered superb customer service along with the rest of the staff at The Marker and were more than happy to go the extra mile. 

The food was delicious at breakfast every morning and we loved going to the Spa which provided a tranquil escape from the bustle of the city. We went to the Rooftop Terrace where we took in beautiful views of Dublin city while enjoying complimentary refreshments. The room was cleaned to perfection every day. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and I will certainly be recommending it to friends and family. I hope we will be back to visit again in the near future. Relaxing, indulgent and stunning service!",5,2020,08,01
206,So impressed - staff are a credit to the hotel!,"I stayed in The Marker on a Saturday in July. It was my first hotel stay since Covid and I was so impressed with the coherent and reassuring policy the hotel had in place. 
We were warmly welcomed by Darragh on reception who was so helpful throughout our stay and could not have done more to assist us. Gino was also fantastic and helped assist us upon arrival as we weren‚Äôt sure about queuing etc, he was so friendly also. 
We had a bite to eat and drinks on the rooftop (absolutely stunning - best views of the city) and also used the spa on Sunday which was such a treat after a manic and uncertain few months as a result of the pandemic. 
I can not recommend this hotel enough, I am living in Dublin and not far from the city centre but this felt like I was on my holidays (if only for one night!)
I hope to book in again next month and will be recommending to friends / family. 
The staff, facilities and overall experience are superb and after the crazy few months, it was great to feel a sense of normality and comfort in such a beautiful location.",5,2020,07,21
206,Great Experience!,"I stayed here with my partner in November when we came to Dublin on a mini break.

I loved the hotel and couldn‚Äôt find fault in anything. The staff were very polite, the place is immaculate and there are great facilities such as the pool, spa, gym and rooftop bar. There was also a very large menu at breakfast to cater for absolutely everyone.

I felt the price we paid was fair and I‚Äôd certainly recommend it to others - especially if you have the time to enjoy the pool area and make the most of your stay.

Hotels in Dublin command a certain price based on how popular the city is with tourists. The cost of staying here vs staying at a 3* with less amenities isn‚Äôt often so much. If you are in need of a treat, this is a great option.",5,2020,06,11
206,Excellent quality hotel ..but don‚Äôt expect a late check out ,"We visit Dublin regularly and decided to use the Marker for the first time due to its location in the harbour area. 
The hotel is modern and high quality fittings and furnishings 
Nice and open and bright 
Our room of 35m2 is really nice with a view and comfortable furnishings 
Lovely breakfast with good a la carte choices plus an extensive buffet selection. 
Staff are all pleasant and professional- obviously well trained 
Considering the breakfast included the room prices are quite reasonable. 
Only quibble was in a half empty hotel due to the virus situation they want to charge us E40 an hour for a late check out.  Lost a few points with that.  We will check out tomorrow on time ...

",4,2020,03,09
206,Nice Treat,"Popped in here before attending a show in Bord Gais. We got a table quite near the door, it was starting to fill up so we were lucky to get one. There was a cold breeze hitting us every time the door opened and that was regularly. There was a very relaxed atmosphere here with people also attending the show. Dinner was lovely, reasonably priced and the complimentary nuts they serve are a lovely extra touch. Drink is quite dear, ‚Ç¨8 for the cheapest class of wine. Called back in after the show, it wasn‚Äôt as busy but again nice & cost, we got a seat away from the door this time ! Staff were efficient, table service is handy. Wasn‚Äôt our first time here and certainly won‚Äôt be the last. ",5,2020,03,08
206,Marker Hotel experience,"Fabulous overnight stay, with late check out privilege...Friendly, warm, welcoming staff with genuine concern. The food/drinks was first class... Room & bed ‚Äúso comfortable‚Äù with bright, airy, quiet environment... The Spa & pool added to the relaxing dimension of our stay which has a very high standard of comfort & hygiene... Unforgettable excellent experience... Can‚Äôt wait to come back again.. . From special ladies",5,2020,03,02
206,Breakfast poor and stay was booked through the NH rewards scheme but was then informed my points were invalid,Breakfast was poor and isn‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt warrant price point. I booked this hotel as it is supposedly in the NH hotel group as I am a silver member. However the staff would not accept my membership of this rewards scheme as they said ‚Äúthey are a new hotel to the group and could not do anything‚Äù. Not worth the money and I wouldn‚Äôt agree with the 5 star status. I have also stayed in the Gibson across the river and it is far nicer and only holds 4 stars and is cheaper.,2,2020,03,02
206,Pre Theatre Meal,"Met the most amazing staff,  guided by an equally impressive manager whilst out for a pre theatre meal. Whilst the quality of the food was super , the efforts and attention  of the staff on what was a very busy Friday night was second to none.  Long story short, thank you for making our evening such a pleasant experience and one that I will remember and tell friends and family about for some time to come. Well done and thank you",5,2020,02,29
206,"Wonderful hotel, delightful stay","Off the bat I‚Äôll start by saying the only negative thing about this hotel is that it‚Äôs a bit far away from central Dublin (Grafton St is a good 25 mins walk away) but we did walk it a couple of times in dry weather.

Aside from this, what an absolutely lovely hotel. We arrived mid to late morning on Friday and had a super warm welcome from the doorman Kevin. Our room was already ready for us which was brilliant so we could check in immediately. Throughout our stay everyone we encountered was unfailingly polite and helpful.

The room was spacious, the bathroom amazing. One point about the bathroom was the under floor heating was almost scaldingly hot so we had to be mindful to turn it down or it ended up being far too hot in there! The shower was great, bath likewise. All lovely. In room iron and hairdryer (and normally in hotels the hairdryer is always rubbish but this was a proper one). Turn down service was lovely, in the evening the room was left beautifully tidy and chocolates left on the bed.

Breakfast was one of the best I‚Äôve ever seen in a hotel - the buffet was fresh and plentiful plus you had a range of a la Carte options to choose from too. Really impressed.

We used the spa when the weather drove us indoors and that was also one of the best I‚Äôve visited. We didn‚Äôt have any treatments as they were fully booked but we used the pool, jacuzzi etc and it was clean and had a touch of luxury about it. 

I would strongly recommend anyone to stay here - locally there‚Äôs not much around other than offices (Facebook, Google, various banks) but if you don‚Äôt mind a long walk or a 10 minute cab ride (which varied between ‚Ç¨6-12) then this is definitely the best option...even the taxi drivers remarked what a lovely hotel it is!",5,2020,02,16
206,"Good, but could be improved ","I stayed for a few nights in a nice corner suite room for a combined business / pleasure trip to Dublin. While the standard of the room is good and the service seems to be fine ( I didn‚Äôt eat in the restaurant or bar, only had room service which was good ) the room ( and hotel?? ) suffers a bit from ‚Äústyle over substance‚Äù. For example, 

1. The air conditioning vents are right above the top end of the bed - blowing cold air down right on your head, so you can‚Äôt leave on when sleeping. 
2. Really no storage other than very limited hanging space in a narrow wardrobe - so you‚Äôll be living out of your suitcase. 
3. The room lighting is poor, especially you‚Äôre trying to do hair and make/up. 
4. Shaving mirror is nowhere near the sink! It‚Äôs above the toilet. Don‚Äôt know about anyone else, but I normally rinse my razor in under the tap, not in the toilet üòÇ
5. I could add more, but I won‚Äôt ....

Overall the hotel is clean and vibrant and is located in a very nice part of the city, handy for Aviva etc. 

I‚Äôd stay again, as I liked the ambiance, but I might try a different ( lower priced? ) room to see if it was better equipped. ",4,2020,02,16
206,Not great,"Always wanted to stay here but they never reduced their prices but on Black Friday I got a deal.
Overall not impressed they rooms are just okay, very dark corridors leading to the rooms, came back at night after the show bar is awful poor service and uncomfortable.
Breakfast was not great when we went to Breakfast at 9 everything appeared to be cooked at 7 am not good.
Sorry I won‚Äôt be going back.",3,2020,02,13
206,Marker stands out,"Serene, plush and lovely spacious rooms.  The decor is real quality, and the rooms are well-appointed.  The en-suite was very pleasant.  The room was quiet.  The meeting area in the lobby and the breakfast area was very welcoming, neat and smart.",5,2020,02,13
206,A hotel stands on its breakfast and boy does the Marker.,"Myself and my friend were over nighting in Dublin as we were going to Riverdance in the 3 Arena. The Ireland Wales Rugby Match was also on at the AVIVA. Despite that, and with all the usual tourist, we were dealt with in an efficient way by friendly staff. One of the stand outs for us was when our taxi arrived, one of the Receptionists went outside to check that it was the taxi ordered for us and returned to confirm that it was ours and we were on our way. It was a wild night out (weather wise) so no standing on the pavement. Our twin bedroom was fab with a super bathroom. For me a hotel stands on its breakfast and boy does the Marker it was amazing with lovely engaging staff and no one rushing you on.",5,2020,02,11
206,Good rooms but the bar and restaurant let it down,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Marker early February 2020. I cannot fault the room, very clean, comfortable and accommodating. The part that lets it down is the restaurant. On the first evening I had the Crab and Prawn linguini and it was tasteless with no seasoning or flavour at all. The next morning I ordered a ‚Äúprotein hit‚Äù omelette and again this was tasteless with no flavour at all. I decided to eat elsewhere for the remainder of my stay. Also, the bartender added an extra ingredient to my Old Fashioned, so it wasn‚Äôt really an Old Fashioned. A lot could be done to improve the overall experience. Lots of work needed in the restaurant and the bar may need a little cocktail training.",3,2020,02,09
206,Far from 5* experience,"Things didn't go well from the start at this hotel. Firstly we had to lap the hotel to get a space at the front for the valet to collect the car. Check in was slow but as the receptionist was a trainee this was fine. Went to our room to await our luggage - 30 minutes later no signof our bags and I didn't have much time to get ready for a show we were to see. Tried to ring reception only to be placed on hold for over 5minutes. Gave up and went down to be told the luggage was on the way, which we knew was a lie as ours was on the same cart as my parents luggage which they had received some time before. On the way back to our room we meet another guest carrying our bag down to reception- it had been put in the wrong room, luckily of somebody trustworthy. At dinner our party were seated at a low coffee table for dinner in the bar area which made for a very uncomfortable experience. Food was ok but not 5 star standard. After the show we come back to the bar and order a round of drinks from the waitress. After 20 minutes we had to enquire where these drinks were. Myself and my mother ordered 2 Hendricks gin. When it arrived we could taste that it was not Hendricks but drank it anyway as it had taken so long to arrive in the first place. Waitress takes another half hour to come back with the bill for the round at which time the gins were drank and we discover to our shock that they had taken it upon themselves to give us 2 monkey 47 gins at a total of ‚Ç¨35 for the 2 drinks. Disgusting carry on and left an extremely sour taste at the end of the night. Out of a party of 6 that stayed not one of us would return, there are far better hotels in Dublin than this ""5*"" establishment. The extremely comfy bed and beautiful bathroom were the only saving graces of what otherwise was comedy of errors from start to finish.",1,2020,02,08
206,Credit card authorization form,"I have recently booked a room for two in The Marker Hotel.
Although I wish to prepay for the room and other extras by visa debit card over the phone before arrival they have insisted that I need to sign a credit card authorization form, which I‚Äôm asked for the full card number, my CVV code and expiration date on paper to send to them. That also want a picture of my card front and back and a second ID to prove I‚Äôm the card holder.

Never in all my years have I been asked to provide any of these. Especially not for a one night stay. I‚Äôm willing to pay with my own card over the phone without going to the hassle of all they want. Bank of Ireland have also recommended I don‚Äôt send pictures of my card to anyone. 

Also, when I asked for an explanation they say ‚Äúit‚Äôs hotel policy‚Äù. If they gave me a logical reason I would understand.

I certainly won‚Äôt be booking here again.",1,2020,02,07
206,Outstanding views and attention to detail,"We stayed at the Marker for four nights this past September, and found it to be a wonderful place from which to explore Dublin.  The staff is accommodating, polite, and quite international (which matches Dublin's dynamic vibe perfectly).  We had a corner room with a view of the water and it was a delightful way to spend the mornings and evenings after exploring the city.

The beds and amenities in the corner suite are excellent, and the maid service quite good which is fortunate as purple carpet shows every bit of lint imaginable.

Although this is an obvious high-end business traveler destination (Facebook is just a few doors down), our family of four was made to feel welcome.  A thoughtful birthday surprise was waiting for us in our room when we arrived, and our teenage kids loved the candy jars in the lobby.

The restaurant, though quite good, is certainly on the pricey side, but this isn't surprising given the nature of the property.

We would certainly come back to this hotel if we ever find ourselves in Dublin again.",5,2020,02,06
206,The Marker Hotel,"The weather outside is frieghtful, but inside its delightful. It has a modern decor, a friently, excellent staff. They have a beach, pool, gym, roof top dining ( I didn't use any of them). I also didn't use the orange balls and go golfing; but I enjoyed the bar, the locals, the restaurant. I took a trip to the Blarney Stone and one to Cliffs of Molher.",5,2020,02,06
206,Fantastic hotel & great attention to detail ,"Stayed here for the rugby , from the valet parking to the complimentary bottles water coming in at 12am the level of service is 5 star . Lovely breakfast and will be counting the days until I return again ",5,2020,02,02
206,Luxury and great customer focus,"From the moment we arrived very great staff attention and attitude. We had a corner suite just superb. Room is spacious and luxurious. The lounge is a fold out bed, surprisingly a very poor quality and therefore very uncomfortable to sit on. Very odd.

Lots of connections for power and USB, excellent wifi.

Room service again excellent, highly recommend the club sandwich.

Also I tested the Guinness in the bar on main floor, passed the test with flying colours 

Will stay again, worth the time and the dollars",5,2020,02,02
206,A perfect long weekend ,"Wow! What a stay we had at this fabulous hotel. So many hotels sell themselves on ‚Äúauthentic hospitality‚Äù and ‚Äúlocal knowledge‚Äù but The Marker team really have this down to a T. From our first welcome from the doorman to our early AM check out with the night porter, the warm and friendly service was incredible. 

Highlights include the beautiful spa, definitely book a treatment of you have time, I see why the spa have won so many awards, my massage and facial we‚Äôre among the best I‚Äôve had. We used the gym and swam daily too, so nice to have state of the art facilities on your doorstep. Breakfast was also lovely, every morning the staff were warm and attentive and service for items ordered from the kitchen was very slick. The rooms themselves are very spacious, especially the bathroom which had a separate bath and shower (we booked an entry level room). Nice to have much needed touches like usb charging points by the bed and a well stocked mini bar. The only tiny improvement I could suggest is a Bluetooth speaker (although the TV had a good library of music).

The ground floor bar served excellent food and drinks, service was also impeccable and the fact it was so busy with locals was also testament to its quality.

The local area is lovely, some really nice bars/restaurants right on your doorstep or you can easily walk (20 mins) or taxi into the city centre (about 12 euros). 

Finally, we have to thank the wonderful concierge team. We arrived in Dublin with no plans and trusted them work our dinner reservations which were on point every night. I work in the luxury hotel industry myself and can be lovely hard to please but I cannot stop talking about our amazing stay. Thank you so much for helping these burnt out parents relax and re-charge, we are already planning our next trip! ",5,2020,01,30
206,5 Star all the way,"I had a breakfast meeting here this week. Super well groomed staff with a wonderful Lobby. The food was exceptional overseen by Executive Head Chef Gareth Mullins.
Behind the scenes is as spotless as front of house.
I couldn't speak more highly of this 5 Star Hotel",5,2020,01,30
206,Wonderful trip to Dublin!,"The Marker was a great place to stay, walking distance to everything Dublin has to offer. The room was comfortable and the amenities are chic and plentiful. Robes and slippers were lovely. Turndown service was wonderful. What really made this experience special was the staff at the hotel. They went out of their way to be warm, welcoming and hospitable. Particular mentions: Kush, who was helpful and patient; Catriona, who was personable and friendly; Kenneth, who always remembered us coming/going and who always looked incredibly dapper and charming; and Vladimir, who was just the most kind and caring. Thank you to this hotel for making us feel welcomed and taken care of!",5,2020,01,29
206,Great Hotel,"Cannot fault this place. The staff were absolutely fantastic. The vibe from all the staff is ultra friendly and all about making your stay as comfortable as possible. If this is the impression the hotel wants to portray, congratulations you have succeeded. Would recommend to all.",5,2020,01,29
206,Nice hotel but not 5 star,A nice modern hotel which is well located for local bars and access into Dublin city centre. Not sure how it has a 5 star rating as the breakfast service was poor and rooms quite bare. Enjoyed my stay here but the are much better hotels for the money.,3,2020,01,28
206,Amazing hotel,"This hotel is a notch above the rest. The service was excellent. The room was comfortable. Clean. The hotel itself is lovely. We visited the spa for massages and enjoyed this incredible pool, sauna and steam room. 
The restaurants are pricey, like in every hotel, but really good quality. 
I was really impressed with this hotel as well as all the employees who were professional and friendly. ",5,2020,01,27
206,Business Trip,"Very nice hotel and nice employee.
The food at the marker bar was delicious and the room service personal was also great.
The nice warm welcome at the reception at the check in and check out was a good start or end for the day.",5,2020,01,27
206,The best place to stay in in Dublin,"Everyone is so nice in this hotel. 
Perfect place to sleep or to spend relaxing time in Dublin. The room was perfect and the bathroom stunning. The view from the room we had in the 6th floor was so nice ! Breakfast is also really amazing. And the services are perfect. Not to mention the access to a gym and a pool is always a plus. ",5,2020,01,27
206,Great Spa,"We stayed for one night in the hotel.

The spa was lovely, great pool, sauna etc. I availed of a treatment whilst there and it was perfect. I would highly recommend having one if you have the time when you are there. 

We had dinner in the brasserie, the food was delicious and it was a reasonable price for this standard hotel. We availed of breakfast and it had a good selection.

We didn‚Äôt know about the Valet parking prior to arrival and had to park in the nearby Grand Canal car park. We would recommend getting in touch with the hotel prior to arriving in relation to their parking service as the adjacent car park is extremely overpriced.",5,2020,01,25
206,A very bitter aftertaste at check out,We were a delegation of 10 people who stayed for about 6 nights each. When I asked to do a late check out to 2pm the management insisted to bill me 40 euros for those 2 extra hours. I am an experienced traveller and have never seen such petty behaviour in a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù hotel.,3,2020,01,24
206,Going to the Sound of Music in the Bord Gais Theatre.,"An absolutely brilliant place to stay. The hotel is ideal but it is the staff that make it. Could not do enough for us. Thank You to all of the staff of The Marker. Cleaners, Doormen, Bar Staff, Breakfast Staff, all were very professional and nothing was a problem.",5,2020,01,22
206,Fabulous,"We booked this stay to have a break away after a tough week. This hotel was excellent.

The room and beds were very comfortable with black out curtains. The heated floor in the bathroom was lovely. There was a HUGE bath and walk in shower in our room.

Breakfast was delicious especially the eggs benedict that was served with crispy bacon - back to normal bacon the next morning that wasn't as tasty. The staff in the restaurant were helpful and excellent at their jobs. Availability of non-dairy milks and green juices was great! 

I struggled to get a booking at the spa which was disappointing to be honest. I hope these weren't take up by non-hotel guests.

Traffic can be an issue around the hotel due to the theatre nearby so i would plan around that. The valet parking was an excellent service.

We would definitely stay here again.",5,2020,01,21
206,The is a first class hotel in great location,"This was my first time at the hotel and thought the hotel facilities and staff were absolutely first class. I stay 10-12 times a year in 5 star hotels and this had the best service from reception to housekeeping. The breakfast was beautiful, you could have buffet along with any fresh produce you wanted. The staff at breakfast were the best I have ever encountered. Thank you and will bring my wife next time! ",5,2020,01,21
206,Short City Stay,"Great Location for the hotel and room was very nice. Bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spotless, and great decor throughout, but it was a little dark, lack of lighting.  Breakfast was good and a great choice.",4,2020,01,21
206,Brilliant Hotel - 10/10 would recommend,"One of the best hotels I've stayed in, everything was great, from the facilities to the service to the location of the hotel. When we first arrived me and my partner were greeted straight away and our bags were taken for us, which was lovely, and we got to check into our room early (bonus). All the staff were very friendly and welcoming, and throughout the entirety of my stay here I couldn't fault the service. The rooms were spacious and clean, with nice touches (such as the complimentary coffee machine), the toiletries and amenities in the room were constantly topped up,  and the bed was so comfy!  
The hotel spa was great as well, very quiet and relaxing. 
I thought the location of the hotel was very good too as there was plenty to explore within the area, and it looked out onto the dock with was pretty. It wasn't too far of a walk to the closest tram stop (about 10 mins), and the bus stop was even closer. If you were ever stuck with anything (like transport or things to do) then the Reception Team and Concierge Team were always there to help. 
 There's only positive things to say about The Marker Hotel! It was excellent and I would definitely come back again!",5,2020,01,21
206,"One the best hotels in the world, A+ 1st class service!","An extraordinary hotel. 

I've stayed all over the world in the greatest hotels the world has to offer and this one is up there with the very best, not because the facility itself is GREAT, whilst it is very good, shiny, modern, new, full featured & carefully thought out - it's the people that make this place work so well. 

It's pricy, you can see that but nobody ever made me feel anything less than fully properly welcome. Whoever's running this place is terrific at getting the best out of their people, they all seem to honestly care about service and they have achieved something truly special. From the guy who welcomed us at the door and took our car, to the check in lady, to the guy who took us to our room, the girl who brought room service, the waiters at breakfast, then the guy who, at check out, got us takeaway coffee to go, I never felt anything less than wholly cared for by everyone I interacted with. This is powerful, worth the money & something that even the best hotels frequently get wrong. If the folks working there don't really care, then it doesn't matter how much marble you put in the bathroom, your stay will be compromised. Not here. 

We had a night to kill between shows and needed a quiet, relaxing night off and that's what we got. The room has everything, it was a good size, the bathroom was spectacular, great coffee machine. 

I would probably say they could use bigger towels, but they do provide dressing gowns which is ace. Another request would be firmer pillows, but I never asked and my guess is that if we had, they would have sent us what we needed, so I feel a bit bad complaining, which i'm not, really - just suggesting that in Asia, top flight hotels provide a pillow menu which i reckon is a thing the Marker could bring to Dublin! 

We intended to use the spa but never did, we had to work anyway and ran out of time, but i'm certain it would be spectacular too like the rest of the place. It's in the middle of Dublin, there's loads of great pubs & places to eat nearby and I would jump at the chance to go back, if I can afford it. 

Whoever is the manager of the staff I mentioned, please thank those people for me, they do you proud and I hope you can continue to provide such a high quality service. Thanks!",5,2020,01,18
206,"Fabulous hotel, but quite pricey for what its is.","Great, but ground-floor bar has absolutely no atmosphere,  and very expensive if there is a show on.

Fabulous hotel, but possibly over priced?  I paid for 2 rooms at over 500 Euro, and the breakfast and parking pushed the cost to over this price by quite a lot.  I would have though the price  was okay if it had included this, because it was my birthday, personal trip, not corporate. ",4,2020,01,14
206,5* ++++ Amazing Stay,"We stayed for a saturday night in January to celebrate a birthday - first of all Kenneth on the door gave us such a warm friendly welcome he helped us organise our luggage, took our car away, showed us to our room and even hung up our coats he was such a star and set such a high standard of service within the first few minutes it was clear he is great at his job, he seemed to remember alot of people by name wishing them a good morning and good evening each time they passed.

when checking in we were told we had access to the spa until 3pm the next day, which is a huge plus! most hotels dont allow for this! we opted for an upgrade to 4th floor which was well worth it- we had a floor to ceiling window with great views! the room was cosey with under floor heating and the bathroom was massive with a rain shower and huge big bath tub. the dressing gowns were fluffy and cosey, we had a bottle of fresh ""Oscar Wilde"" bottled water and a fantastic choice of teas and coffees, especially decaff as I cannot overdo it on the caffeine. 

After check in we went to the bar for drinks and some casual food, all were of fantastic standard and again the service of staff was exceptional. 

The next morning we did not opt for breakfast but hit the spa - it was quite, tranquil and absolutley spotless! it was a real dream and I will consider returning for the spa alone! 

",5,2020,01,13
206,Perfect getaway in the middle of the city,"Great location, service and overall experience. The hotel provides you with a stay that feels like you are somewhere in the middle of nowhere to come to peace. I would highly recommend the hotel and spa.",5,2020,01,12
206,True Five Star Hotel,"A proper five star hotel with great service (staff well trained and attentive), stylish rooms (always nice and quiet) and great attention to detail , lovely modern building, nice art on walls but also comfortable and cosy. Lovely pool area. I have not been disappointed there yet. ",5,2020,01,11
206,Make sure you stay at The Marker if your in Dublin,Only stayed here for 1 night but was amazing. I had one of the best sleeps in years. The bathroom is huge with heated tiled flooring and a deep sunk bath. I tried the gym and had all the equipment for a decent workout. They had free weights and good resistance machines. The hotel is top quality and will come back again when I am in Dublin.,5,2020,01,10
206,04 January 2020,Very good hotel. Service is excellent. Breakfast is the best I‚Äôve had in a hotel. So much too choose from. The bedrooms are very big and the bathrooms are so luxurious. The heated floors are a nice touch. Spa is fab too! Really clean and relaxing down there.  ,4,2020,01,08
206,Quality stay in Dublin,"From the staff parking the car for us, to the great service at check in, the marker is one of the best hotels in Ireland. Rooms clean, big, with great views, and the spa is something else. Will certainly return. ",5,2020,01,08
206,Excellent start to 2020,"Stayed here from the 1st to the 4th Jan. Staff at the front desk were polite and friendly. More than happy to help. Room was very good, great bed and powerful shower. Breakfast was superb. An extensive selection of breakfast options. The hotel is opposite the theatre so great for that. About 20-30 mins walk into town but an enjoyable walk along the river. Taxi‚Äôs into town cost about ‚Ç¨10-15 and arrive at the hotel quickly. Would certainly stay here again if we‚Äôre in Dublin. Very impressed by this hotel.",5,2020,01,07
206,Excellent City Centre Hotel,"A peaceful and modern hotel, with muted decor and excellently appointed rooms.  Brasserie was superb, and staff excellent throughout.  The Spa an Swimming pool are top-notch - and a great way to relax before dinner in the brasserie. ",5,2020,01,07
206,Perfect weekend stay,"The hotel is about a 15 minute walk from central Dublin, but there‚Äôs still plenty around to see/do/eat/drink etc. 
The hotel is modern but still classy and all of the staff we met were friendly, helpful and attentive. 
Check in was quick and our room (corner suite) was perfect for a few nights stay. It felt modern, but warm and comfortable. 
Great amenities and big bathroom. 
Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2020,01,07
206,"A 4.5 Great stay, but the food could be better","My partner and I stayed at The Marker Hotel for a two night staycation for their New Year's Eve party and New Year's Day recovery. We actually extended to stay that extra day after NYE as we were having such a great time. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a modern five star hotel in Dublin. 

Service: I will start off by saying that the service throughout our entire stay was excellent. We did not encounter one sour face of those having to work NYE. From the rooftop bar, we were able to see the midnight firework displays from all over the Dublin region, and it was overall a nice time. I also appreciated that it wasn't a pretentious setting despite being a 5 star hotel.

The spa: My partner had a massage at the spa from Justine (I believe that was her name), and she told me it was the best massage in her entire life. 

I used the pool and jacuzzi room. I will make one mention that I found having children under 12 there to not mesh with the ambiance the pool area is trying to put on. This is a rare complaint from me, because I personally love kids and have no issue if they are running around anywhere i.e. a restaurant making noise or just being kids. But there were four kids in pool making quite a scene, and it just didn't fit with the vibe of the spa at all. I am chill, but I could imagine this wouldn't be great for other guests. I think they should probably consider a pool area for children in the future that is separate or a specific area of that long ranging pool length that could be roped off for them. I won't knock the rating down for this though as everything else about the spa experience was perfect, but just an observation for improvement. 

The room: The room was comfy and the bathtub was awesome. The TV channels were lacking though. Also, there weren't enough outlets in the bathroom (or I believe there weren't any other than for shavers). All in all loved the room though. 

The food: We ate at The Marker Bar, the room service menu, and the restaurant Brasserie. The food was really a let down for me, and the main reason I am not able to give it a full 5. I struggled with this, because we had 5/5 for our time there, but the food issue I think has to be noted. The room service cheeseburger and fries were really bad. For 20 euro and being a 5 star hotel, I would expect a lot better. 

We also had the NYE multi-course dinner at Brasserie, which I wasn't terribly impressed with. The amuse bouche and dessert were terrible -- there just isn't a lighter way to put it. I don't understand the point of doing all these fancy things with dessert and then it tastes disgusting. A simple chocolate cake or mousse sometimes will do. The starter and mains were fine, but very tiny. The only thing that was of a wow-level was the champagne sorbet. I am going to hope that this was maybe just an issue with the menu for this particular day. I would give Brasserie another try at some other time as it's an acclaimed restaurant. 

The breakfast was good, and probably the best meal I felt I ate at the hotel. 

Overall aside from the disappointing food -- the hotel was excellent, the service and spa treatment superb, rooms are nice, and we will be back in the future.",4,2020,01,06
206,Great Hotel,"The hotel is well located and in a nice modern neighborhood. It has a lovely Spa!  The rooms are clean and comfortable.  Good continental breakfast with a lot of choice. The staff is very friendly and helpful.  
I highly recommend this Hotel if you plan to visit Dublin.",5,2020,01,05
206,Second wonderful stay,"We stayed at the marker in August of 2016 and returned for two nights after visiting family in Cork.  Once again an excellent stay - room was excellent with a very comfortable bed and well stocked bathroom and honor bar, we used the pool with our daughter, breakfast was excellent and staff was very helpful in dinner recommendations.",5,2020,01,05
206,"Great Break, but could be more child friendly","Super service and great atmosphere....less child friendly than advertised. Spa/Pool/Gym access very restricted for under 18, rules should be for under 12-14 year olds, not for under 18s....
archtecture makes the stay really calm and relaxing",4,2020,01,04
206,Average,"Stayed here before in the past and really rated the hotel but this time has put me off. 

When we first got to check in desk at the hotel the woman on the desk told us we had to wait to check in as the room wasn‚Äôt available, fine by me. But then few minutes later the staff was taking our stuff to our room as it was ready, yet we couldn‚Äôt go yet.. not sure why this was but we took ourselves out and came back to avoid the hassle.

We got put in a room with air con that didn‚Äôt work, surprisingly the rooms were hot and it was really needed. First night the staff gave us a fan and next day we requested it was fixed which they did and gave us drink vouchers which was nice. That evening got back to the room and the air con was making very loud noises and the staff were unable to fix it after having to listen to a load of racket for about an hour. Also the staff failed to come back and tell us it wasn‚Äôt working after he said he would try once more and let us know. We were offered to move to another room but it was late at night and we were checking out early so passed on it. Had a terrible nights sleep and waking up sweating, not great when had early start for the airport. 

Two other things: the spa was full of children, splashing around shouting, hardly relaxing and I really don‚Äôt get why children are allowed into a spa it ruins the experience for adults and turns it into a playground! 

Also we had a meal the second night in the bar and the staff were terrible! They were all so unhappy and literally had the grumpiest faces I have ever seen. One woman abruptly shouted at someone who simply asked if it was self seating as no one would attend to them patiently waiting by a ‚Äòplease wait to be seated‚Äô sign.

Overall I won‚Äôt be back in future, I have stayed in many hotels in Dublin above this standard and the price does not reflect the quality. I came for a relaxing break and it was far from it! Also a long walk to the centre so make sure you are prepared.

206,Great service and the best pillows ever,My family stayed here for several days and after the first night we all brought up the fact that we LOVED the pillows We travel often and never found pillows like these.  Wish we knew where to get them.  The hotel was wonderful. Staff friendly and accommodating! The food and drinks were excellent ! Location is a bit out of the way but it didn‚Äôt matter. It was nice to walk to the center. We loved the cookies they left in our room and roof top and spa was fantastic !  There is a theatre right out side the door and if a show is on. It‚Äôs very convenient!! Also Lazlo the concierge was terrific!!,5,2020,01,02
206,"Excellent hotel ,","Very pleasant stay here, excellent hotel , room service very good , Expensive but you pay for what you get , will stay again here . Car park attendant really good, will recommend this Hotel to friends,",4,2019,12,31
206,Beautiful & accommodating hotel in great location with great views of water and theater next door,This hotel was just gorgeous. Our room was fabulous and comfortable. Slept great. Huge bathroom with great huge glass shower and separate tub. Plenty of space to stretch out and great views of water below and theater next door. Lots of pretty lighted sculptures that glow at night on the courtyard below. Saw lots of swans in the waters outside. Food here was excellent. Great location and wonderful staff. Be sure to make it to the rooftop bar while you are here. The views are amazing. ,5,2019,12,30
206,Christmas at The Marker,"My daughter and I stayed at The Marker Hotel, as we were going to a show in Bord Gais. Our overnight stay was really enjoyable. We will definitely be back, hopefully next time we will have the whole family with us. ",5,2019,12,30
206,Excellent Stay - Highly recommend,Hotel and staff were exceptional.  Breakfast was amazing and plentiful.  Spa was great and facilities were extremely clean and refreshing.  Our room was lovely but I wouldn't recommend the in room coffee. ,5,2019,12,29
206,Great service,This is a lovely modern hotel where I spent a few hours yesterday catching up with visiting family members in the ground floor bar/reception area. The service was great and I want to particularly call out the gentleman who made a big effort to chat with my young children who were clearly getting bored with their formal surroundings. I didn‚Äôt catch his name but he mentioned he had recently moved to Ireland from London. In hospitality it‚Äôs the small things that make a difference.,5,2019,12,29
206,Hotel Dublin,Stayed one night for a show in Bord Gais two minutes walk. Check hotel website for prices as they came out the best of all other sites. Lots of restaurants around the area. 20 minute walk into Dublin great to see the sites.,5,2019,12,28
206,Great hotel in wonderful location,"The Marker is a very modern hotel staffed with enthusiastic professionals. The bedrooms are quiet and have excellent ensuites.  My only slight criticism is the lack of good light for applying makeup. 
The lobby is a very convivial meeting place where  food and drinks are available. There‚Äôs lots of choice on the breakfast buffet and also a good selection of cooked to order food.",5,2019,12,28
206,Excellent,"Excellent hotel not far from city centre, very friendly staff at reception, rooftop bar and restaurant, very comfy beds and pillows with turn down service. Very nice spa area. I would recommend and would definitely book again ",5,2019,12,27
206,Theatre night,"We stayed in this Hotel 20 December. From the moment we arrived by car were so well looked after by the welcoming Concierge and Reception. Our car taken and parked for us /what a relief we did not have to do it! 
Bar service excellent /we had a Croatian who could not be more helpful /after the theatre he was still on duty /all smiles and welcomed us back. 
Dinner  was very good in Brasserie  As was the Breakfast. Again excellent caring service.
Our room was most comfortable and a terrific turn down service was given. We had not requested it . So thank you for that.
We will certainly return again.",5,2019,12,21
206,Nice stay away,"Had another lovely stay at the marker. Happy to return again. Cannot say anything but good things about this hotel. Thank you for a great time. 

Next time we will stay longer and enjoy the spa, which I heard was excellent. ",5,2019,12,19
206,One of the best in Dublin,"A wonderful weekend greatly helped by the Marker Hotel and staff for providing a top of the range service, very comfortable room and bed. Saturday evening meal at the Brasserie was amazing , relaxing with quality food .Will definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2019,12,17
206,Can't wait to return,"We stayed overnight whilst in town for a concert.

The Good.

1. The service was superb throughout from valet parking to check in to room and bar service. Friendly and helpful.

2. The public areas look great and glamorous from the reception to the bar. 

3. The location is pretty good for the city centre and the 3 Arena and Bord Gais theatre but it is a reasonable walk to most places. 

4. The rooms are well equipped with spacious beds and full length window with nice views over the city. Good aircon.

5. The bathrooms are really good with underfloor heating and large baths and showers.

6. The bar had a great range of drinks and interesting cocktails. Service was good but the prices were a bit steep.

7. We had breakfast in the room and everything was superb.

8. Great value with a Black Friday deal including breakfast, welcome pastries and a free cocktail each.

The Bad.

1. The lighting in the room was a little inadequate making the room dark.

2.We had evening room service. Most of it was good but the club sandwich was soggy and had far too much tomato.

Overall

An excellent first stay but want to return as we had limited time so we would love to use the spa and rooftop bar on a future visit.",5,2019,12,16

206,Fabulous modern hotel,Another great stay at the Marker. This is a fabulous hotel with a great atmosphere. Rooms are spacious with very comfortable beds and luxurious bathrooms. Everyone we dealt with was efficient and very friendly. Will certainly choose again when visiting our son in Dublin.,5,2019,12,13

206,Great Base To Explore Dublin,"Stayed for a couple of nights for a Winter break. First visit to Dublin and to The Marker and will be back.

Not cheap - but nothing in Dublin is! Not pretentious in any way though. Staff were attentive but not over bearing. Facilities in the hotel are great - nice bar and lounge area with a good range of cocktails and nice pj t of Guinness. A fifteen minute walk into the centre - but a nice walk with lots to see along the way.

Breakfast was fantastic!! Overall - a great experience and we‚Äôll be back.",5,2019,12,05
206,"Wonderful, world-class service, average rooms!","The amenities of the room were a disappointment and did not match up with the wonderful service we enjoyed during our 6 night stay at the Marker. A lack of storage in the room, coupled with lack of outlets in the bathroom, and poor lighting left much to be desired.  The bed, the coffee, and the service were FIRST RATE, though!",4,2019,12,04
206,Beautiful stay,"Decor was beautiful, room was so lovely and comfortable. Staff always there to help and always happy . Spa treatments well priced and very relaxin, the pool was lovely. Location of the hotel very nice and the valet parking was brilliant and inexpensive ",5,2019,12,03

206,"Very comfortable hotel, disappointing breakfast","This is an extremely well appointed hotel. The rooms are extremely comfortable and well equipped. The hotel reception was very efficient. The hotel is very well located close to the river.
The only disappointment was the breakfast. If you want Irish breakfast it is very good. The was a distinct lack of choice for the more health conscious. There was a menu of alternatives but there was quite a long wait, not something that is usually an option at breakfast time !",4,2019,11,23
206,Superb hotel,"The staff make this hotel a five-star experience - they are truly attentive and helpful. The public areas of the hotel are well designed and comfortable. I was only staying for one night and the room was very comfortable, though a bit bare and the lighting was quite dim. It was convenient for the convention centre and close to good public transport links to the rest of the city, but it is a short walk to the shops of the city centre - the area around the hotel is more aimed at the businesses in the docks than visitors. The hotel bathroom was stunning and they had many thoughtful touches like a dedicated card for the power switch in the hotel room, so you didn't have to use your key to put the lights on. The welcome was very warm and I think anyone would enjoy a stay at The Marker. ",5,2019,11,23
206,Excellent hotel,"I visited Dublin for five days and i had the luck to stay to this hotel. Not far from the city center, with wonderful spacious rooms. The staff was very helpful and kind.

206,Close to tech offices,I recently stayed here while visiting Dublin for work. The Marker is very close to the many technology companies in the nearby area. If you're visiting make sure to pack your bathing suit because the spa/pool is a great way to wind down after a day of work.,5,2019,11,15
206,Excellent property with refined service,Very nice hotel on the edge off Dublin. Service is top notch and refined. Rooms were huge especially the bathrooms. Only drawback is a lot (including the one I had) have a view of courtyard. I was on business so didn‚Äôt really matter...if you are vacation perhaps requesting a bit of a view would be nice. Rooftop bar was closed but others commented how nice it is outside of winter. Mainly a business crowd and 15-20 minute walk into the centre of Dublin.,5,2019,11,13

206,Well worth it,Met with friends for the weekend in Dublin and booked The Marker on recommendation from a friend. So worth it. One of the nicest hotels I‚Äôve stayed in for a while. Great facilities and the most friendly helpful staff. Good food served. Will be back,4,2019,11,13
206,Great views nice staff,We were going to a show in the Bord g√°is theatre and this hotel is directly opposite. Our room had a view of grand canal Square and the grand canal basin so a fantastic view. The room was nice with tea and coffee and biscuits supplied as well as water. We ate in the restaurant for dinner. The main was delicious and the starter just OK. We had a bottle of wine with the meal. The cheapest bottle was 35 euros. This was the one we had. It was malbec and nice but I thought the wine other than this to be very expensive. The food was reasonably priced. Breakfast is OK. There is hot and cold choices. I have had better though and the Marker is quite expensive so I think breakfast could be a bit better. Overall though I really like the Marker. Staff are very nice and I love the view. ,4,2019,11,10
206,Very good experience ,"Great stay at the marker hotel. Modern, clean and comfortable rooms (corner suite). The service was friendly. Really enjoyed breakfast- great choice at the buffet and tasty a la carte options.
The only thing is the lightning in the w.c that could be stronger. 
Would come back!",5,2019,11,09
206,A birthday celebration,The hotel is lovely and is ideally placed for us to visit Bord Gais Theatre to see We Will Rock You for my husbands special birthday. The hotel gave us an up grade and chocolate cake with birthday wishes.,4,2019,11,07
206,Birthday Treat,"My husband booked an overnight stay for my birthday.  Hotel is well presented and modern.  Staff are lovely, welcoming and attentive. We didnt eat in the hotel so I cant comment on the food.  We did eat breakfast in a nearby cafe overlooking the canal which was gorgeous in the autumn sun. The bed was very comfortable and there is a great range of channels on the tv.  The shower is soo gorgeous I didnt want to get out.  We did get taxis into the Temple bar area rather than walk due to the rain but he wasnt that expensive. Would recommend.",5,2019,11,05
206,Great location,Great location for a show in the Bord Gais theatre or the 3 arena. Staff are really nice and helpful and the service as very good. The room was a lovely size  and very comfortable. The valet car park is a great service too.,5,2019,11,05
206,High end ultra luxury hotel,"Spent a week here in October. The Marker has a spa and indoor pool. It has top of the line service and amenities.
 There is a lobby bar and service was really very good, there is also a rooftop bar which has some outstanding views .
The hotel hallways are very dark and quiet (a very spa like experience) also seem to be scented in a subtle way that was noticeable but not overpowering. 

Our room was a fair size with a comfortable king bed and pillows. The bathroom was quite nice with heated tile floors, tub and shower . My one complaint here was the lack of towels in the bathroom - one per adult  is the norm here . Even after requesting it was not noted and you had to continually ask.

We had a complimentary breakfast included with our stay and it was  perfection. You had buffet choices as well as menu options. Coffee, tea , juice,  toast were offered immediately upon seating and staff was efficient, polite and pleasant.
The bellman and bar staff were also very helpful.  
Front  desk staff was being trained and although pleasant enough still a green and at times bit condescending . They also gave another couple we were traveling with incorrect train information - if not for a local hearing the conversation they would have ended up quite far from their destination. And for those not familiar with Irish rail in order to get on or off the train you must push a button for the doors to open.

206,"Fantastic hotel, great location ","This hotel is just wonderful. I was part of a large group booking. From the minute you arrive the staff are very helpful and welcoming. My room was really nice, very well maintained and spotlessly clean. The hotel has a really nice bar with a huge variety of choice. Breakfast was excellent - lots of choice. We also had a group meal in the function room. This exceeded my expectations. The food was delicious and the staff were so well organised and pleasant. I will always stay here when visiting Dublin. ",5,2019,10,30
206,A fantastic experience!,"My husband and I stayed for 3 nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We were blown away by the professionalism of all staff from start to finish! A beautiful hotel with great food, beautiful spa (great jacuzzi!) Amazing massage too! Lovely views from the rooftop terrace where we enjoyed a lovely sharing board and cocktail and staff were very attentive! 
Everyone helped us with any questions we had regarding getting to and from places etc.
Reception staff always had a smile and happy to help! 
All hotels should take a leaf out of the Markers book! They really set the standard for 5 star hotels so well done to all the team! We will definitely be returning one day! 
Thank you 

",5,2019,10,29
206,Stay @ Marker,"I got to know about Marker from a reference . Got to know it is one of the best hotels at Dublin. No Doubt it is that was my experience. The stay and food was comfortable. The best part about Marker is the excellent customer support the staff extend , Kudos to the team, keep up the good job.
Only one adverse comment - the hotel should have designated smoking area in-house.",5,2019,10,28
206,Awesome hotel!,"Simply stated - this is a great place to stay in Dublin.  Nice location along the canal, but quiet and has many amenities.  Nice fitness centre, terrific spa, rooms are spacious and clean and the on-premise food options are terrific (the breakfast was great!).",5,2019,10,26
206,Lovely Stay,"Perfect welcoming luxury in the middle of Dublin City.  Really lovely actual Irish staff to welcome us and great culture. Food was delightful. Sleep was peaceful and if ever you want to ruin a good hotel stay, there is plenty of work facilities....",5,2019,10,26
206,Great,Was here for a seminar. The location is perfect. Easy access from Dublin City centre. The seminar room was specious with all equipment working perfectly. The staff were polite and helpful finding your way in the big space.,5,2019,10,24
206,"Amazing hotel, poor breakfast.","Amazing hotel, can‚Äôt fault it. I spent an amazing weekend there with my partner. Spa was very relaxing, room excellent. Breakfast really poor in comparison. I would stay there again, but have breakfast elsewhere. ",5,2019,10,22
206,What a bad attitude,"Recently stayed here for a show in Bord Gais, initially our stay was fine, until the eruption in the corridor/rooms near us. Seems like there was a stag party and it got out of hand. Not one to spoil the party, we tried to get back to sleep, after approx another hour of what sounded like a riot, we rang reception. I'm still in shock, we were told there wasn't really anything they could do, as they had no security on, we just couldn't believe the reply. I again complained on checkout, to which I received a polite apology but nothing else. For the price we paid I would expect a different attitude towards paying guests. Would not recommend and will not be staying again",1,2019,10,21
206,Lovely hotel in a great area!,"The Marker is a beautiful modern hotel on Grand Canal Square. The rooms are spotless and very quiet, so you can get a good night's sleep. They have a very nice gym, pool and spa. The staff was friendly, efficient and helpful. They worked hard to make certain that we had an enjoyable stay. ",4,2019,10,17
206,Our Stay,"Stunning hotel with great customer service- just a couple of issues during our stay.
Hotel gave us an upgrade room however air con not working making room very warm overnight and an unpleasant stagnant odour in the room that both contributed to lack of sleep",4,2019,10,16
206,Amazing stay in an amazing city,The Marker Hotel spoiled us and raised our expectations of the service a hotel should provide. I tasted some of the finest meals in this hotel and our room service calls were attended to in mere minutes. Loved every day of my stay and looked forward to every meal we had at the hotel. ,5,2019,10,15
206,Lovely rooms,"Room was fabulous, bed really comfortable and bathroom amazing.  Surrounding area not great for bars/restaurants.    The rooftop bar is stunning but weather was unfortunately not good. Overall a good stay, but incredibly expensive (breakfast 29euros each).  Would probably choose to stay elsewhere next time based on location.",4,2019,10,14
206,Best Hotel,"Fantastic Hotel. Has it all. Friendly helpful staff, a credit to this hotel. The room was impressive with beautiful views over the river and the square. Quietest hotel room I have ever stayed in, no noise from the corridor or from outside.",5,2019,10,14
206,Perfect ,I stayed here October 2019 the place is perfect the staff are brilliant very professional. My room was huge with floor to ceiling windows a big bath and separate shower. The food in the restaurant was absolutely delicious. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone ,5,2019,10,11
206,A blissful weekend,"I stayed at The Marker on a Saturday night as had come to Dublin for the weekend with a friend to celebrate a birthday and see a show at the Bord Gais Theatre.  The hotel couldn't have been better placed for the theatre (just a walk across the square) and the whole area around Grand Canal Docks was beautiful with a few shops and restaurants overlooking the water.  It was very peaceful yet easily accessible to more central parts of Dublin.
The beds and pillows in the rooms were bliss - I very rarely sleep well at hotels but I did here!  The  bathroom was very luxurious with separate bath and shower and underfloor heating.
The Rooftop Bar is a must - it was cold but we were brought warm blankets!
The breakfast was one of the best hotel breakfasts I have ever had with a real range of items available at a buffet and a selection of different cooked options available to order.
We used the spa on Sunday - the treatment was quite expensive but really very good.
The staff were friendly and helpful and we had a great stay.",5,2019,10,10
206,Great stay ,"I was treated to a weekend at the Marker hotel from my partner for my birthday and what a lovely hotel it was! From the minute we checked in the customer service was 100%. 
This continued when we discovered that my partner had booked a twin room as opposed to a double room. We went to reception to see if there was any chance of getting the beds pushed together and to our great surprise the manager (Zeus I think he‚Äôs called, I apologise if I‚Äôm wrong) upgraded us to a larger room with a king bed. The room was spotless and made our stay 10 times better. The rooftop bar was amazing at night. Definitely worth a visit. We also used the pool which was pretty cool as it was very dark. We would definitely return! ",5,2019,10,09
206,Excellent stay,"Marker is a 5 star hotel in Dublin, Ireland awesome rooms, service and amenities. It also has a rooftop bar. City center from here is at a walking distance. Very apt for business travellers as the IT and financial services offices are close by",5,2019,10,09
206,Outstanding,"Amazing, modern, perfectly located, perfect for business and leisure trips, extremely helpful and professional staff, comfortable and spacious room, clean... espresso machine with a variety of coffee selection in the room. One of the best hotels worldwide I have stayed! :)",5,2019,10,09
206,Great Hotel But Off Center,"This is a relative new hotel in the now burgeoning dock lands area of Dublin.  The hotel architecture  is attractively modern both externally and internally. 

Location ***:  As noted, the Marker is located in the burgeoning dock lands area.  The city center is a good 20+ minute walk to Trinity College.  Unfortunately, when I was looking at the map, it appeared much closer.  We continually took taxis or when available, the Hop On/Off bus.  However, if you are staying in the dock lands area, this hotel is perfect.  

Room *****:  The room is nicely sized and our room faced the the water and the Bord Gais Energy Theatre.  At night the square is beautifully lit up.  The bathroom is a good size with a stall shower and tub; and it has a heated floor.

Service ****:  The staff was friendly and professional, and we only had one mis-step.  We requested turn-down service while we were out to dinner, but were disappointed to find they never showed up.

Food ****:  We only had breakfast at the hotel.  The buffet was good and the options off the menu were also very good.  The staff was very friendly.

Overall ****:  I would have given this hotel  ***** if it had been better located for our purpose.  
",4,2019,10,08
206,Excellent food and service but expensive wine.,"Booked for a meal before taking in a show. The service was excellent and very efficient especially if you were time limited like us. We each had three courses along with a couple of side orders, all of which were very good.
The only criticism we have is seventeen euro for one glass of average wine. This won't stop us visiting again but we will just stick to the water!",4,2019,10,07
206,A night to remember,Had a night away that coincided with a theatre visit. Loved the experience. Very impressed from the front door onwards. Had a quick drink and headed off. We had three rooms booked and they were really nice and very comfortable. We ate in the bar and we're all happy with our food. Went to the rooftop bar for a cocktail before we headed to bed. Wonderful views from there and it would be amazing in the summer months. Everyone slept well. My only complaint was I felt the breakfast buffet could be hotter. Staff were very helpful and attentive.,5,2019,10,06
206,New & Beautiful,"Just spent three nights at The Marker.  It is a wonderful new hotel near all the high tech companies. The room was very comfortable, the service superior, and they also have a great spa.Everyone we encounted was very helpful, and they include a great breakfast.",5,2019,10,05
206,A very nice hotel with one major problem,"The hotel overall is very nice, our room was well laid out and efficient and comfortable.  Of note was the very nice pool, Jacuzzi, steam room and sauna located on the M level that is coed allowing my wife and I to spend a lot of time there.   The concierge was very good at making restaurant suggestions and reservations.  Overall the hotel staff is polite yet a bit timid.  They can't seem to make decisions by themselves and always have to escalate to a ""manager.""

The one huge problem was that at 7:00 AM, in the hotel utility room adjacent to our guest room, they started to do construction work.  At first it sounded like demolition work and instantly woke us up.  We tried to ignore it but it was right next door so we quickly went to breakfast.   Upon returning to the room the work was still going on but now they were drilling/screwing thru the wall separating our room and actually punched thru the wall in several places, raining plaster down on the TV and my computer.   Of course we called the hotel staff and they went to find a ""manager"", and several people came to the room.  Eventually we were moved to another room but this took some work/time as we had already spend 4 nights in that room.   After all of this the management didn't offer anything to make things right for the massive inconvenience they put us thru, and even the hotel staff thought management was being ridiculous.   But we don't complain, we get even, hence this post.   So the hotel blew it on several accounts.   They should have control over when/where they do construction in their utility areas, they should not have guests in the adjacent room at the time, they should have at least warned us the construction was happening, and after wasting half our day they should have offered some compensation of some sort, at least a couple free drinks?   

So a very nice hotel that doesn't have their act together.   You can stay there if you wish but watch out for construction noises...",2,2019,10,01
206,Nearly perfect,Beautiful hotel but service is brassiere was very slow not very helpful either. Was very expensive so expected more from the staff. Food was nice as were drinks. Room was beautiful spa is outstanding loved it. ,4,2019,09,30
206,"Amazing, not to be missed","I was simply blown away by the level of professionalism from the entire team from arrival to restaurant and bar.
Darragh and Vladimir in particular have gone out of their way to make sure I had a wonderful stay.
The Roof top manager was very accommodating and served me the Brasserie menu which was full as an alternative in the bar! 
Exceptional service, customer attention and care.
Food was excellent served by professional individuals always very attentive to your needs.
Rooms are very large and clean, and offer an exceptional comfort
Thank you to the entire team.",5,2019,09,30
206,Post meal drink,"The Marker Hotel has a great location in D4 at the Docklands and close to the city Centre. Bord Gais Theatre is across the street.
We had a relaxing drink here after dinner in their Brasserie Restaurant. I nice comfortable spot for a quiet drink.",5,2019,09,29
206,Contemporary Dublin,"We greatly enjoyed our three nights at the Marker. The room was specious with a lovely view of the courtyard and the water. Very quiet, with very comfortable bed. They were very accommodating and made the room available at 1pm although check in was for 3pm. It is about a 25 minute walk to the center of town.",5,2019,09,28
206,Perfect hotel & visit,"This is a beautiful hotel and great location in Dublin. The service is outstanding, the rooms modern, hip and clean. The location is nice for walking around Dublin and seeing the sights. The food and bar is great too. We loved our stay here! ",5,2019,09,28
206,"Fab hotel, great location.","Fab hotel with an amazing spa. Great location. Staff were absolutely lovely, friendly and engaging. 
OMG the most comfortable bed ever, had an amazing sleep. 
Would definitely recommend this hotel. 
The ONLY thing which disappointed was the bar food. I didn‚Äôt make a complaint at the time as everything else was so nice.",5,2019,09,26
206,LOVED this place,"This is the best hotel I've ever stayed at. The staff were amazing, the pool was amazing, breakfast was amazing. We arrived a little early, luckily our room was available. The rooms are spacious and well decorated. We had a view of the square, which was lit up at night. Pretty cool. Breakfast is included, and delicious. We ate downstairs at the restaurant once, the food was very good and the service exceptional. The pool is very nice, with a sauna, a steam room, and a hot tub also available in the same area. One suggestion, and this has nothing to do with the hotel, the fastest walking route to downtown via google maps will take you along a road which is quite covered with dog poo. I suggest going just a little out of the way and walking along the water. Anyway, if you have the option to stay here, do it! The hotel really is outstanding.",5,2019,09,25
206,Premier league comfort and style,Staff and facilities outstanding. Spa a treat. Everything slick and comfortable. Feels very safe. Totally relaxing stay and nothing ever too much for the team. You will not be disappointed from them moment you come through the door.,5,2019,09,24

206,Friendly and efficient,Excellent service from start to finish. Unfortunately it was a very short business trip so I couldn't enjoy all the facilities on offer but everything I did experience was to a very high standard. I look forward to a return visit in the near future.,5,2019,09,23
206,Tres swell,"All the positive reviews are accurate, all the negatives were clearly written by the sort of curmudgeons who are only happy when others aren‚Äôt. 

That is to say the hotel is a gem. The food indeed (lunch and dinner) was only above average. But I think that‚Äôs life in Ireland. It ain‚Äôt France or Italy. 

A very swell place.",5,2019,09,22
206,Corner room,"Outstanding establishment, with beautiful river view location and an excellent staff. All hotel personnel were very helpful, the breakfast are excellent, and the bars are well stocked and serviced by professionals",5,2019,09,19
206,Wonderful hotel with fabulous service by concierge and desk staff! Beautiful new modern area of town with great pubs and,Great newish modern area of town with great modern architecture and high tech companies making their foray into Ireland. Fun pubs and restaurants in area and hotel itself offers great information for yours and sightseeing and had loads of helpful ideas. Had a wonderful holiday for 5 days at The Marker and would definitely return.,5,2019,09,19
206,Fantastic hotel,"The Marker was a very high quality hotel with great services and amenities. The staff were very knowledgeable and if we asked for something we didn't have to ask again, they all just got it! I was paying for 7 rooms and they made this process very easy as well. The spa and gym are next level, highly recommended. I will be staying at the Marker again if we come back to Dublin",5,2019,09,18
206,Race & Stay in Dublin,"The Marker Hotel was excellent  the staff, the location and facilities all extremely high quality with easy access to the main streets in Dublin, the local business area and its modern facilities clean and safe.",5,2019,09,18
206,5 Star excellence.,"Well located and very new. 
Superb modern well equipped  bedrooms. Comfortable beds and good size bathroom. Quality toiletries included. 
The real stars are the staff. Without exception all were friendly, knowledgeable and smiling, could not do enough for you. 
Local produce used in the restaurant. Breakfast is self service, again all good.",5,2019,09,16
206,Fantastic Hotel with a bit to average food.,"The Marker is a fantastic hotel with beautiful rooms and a fantastic service level.

The service you get from the moment you step out of the taxi outside until you step back into the taxi on departure is simply fantastic. Wonderful rooms, nice bar, very very nice staff.

Sorry to say that the food in the hotel at best is average, with such a fantastic service, fantastic rooms and more or less perfect stay in all other areas it is very disappointing to get average food you can buy in any restaurant. ",4,2019,09,16
206,Great Location,"A lovely modern hotel built on the quays so you are not surrounded by crowds of tourist,which we where glad about.
The room was spacious nice bathroom with walk in shower and all that you can need or want.
There are lots of lively bars and restaurants close by and the roof bar at the hotel is great 
A good place to stay for business or pleasure",4,2019,09,11
206,A fine example for all hotels!,"My husband and I visited Ireland and stayed in 3 different cities. We had the pleasure of staying at the Marker for 4 nights, and it is by far the best in Ireland. The view is waterfront at Hanover Quay, with a modern lighted landscape. Walking along the river Liffey was in our daily plan. Convenient stores and food are a block away. The Marker has hospitality like no other, down to fine details of a mat for the tub, Malin & Goetz products, Baby Bliss hair dryers. They even organized my personal products for me. Amenities such as the pool, Jacuzzi, Rooftop Bar, and spa are all beautiful and serene. The bell hop and valet were extremely helpful in daily itinerary and directions. The rooms are modern and elegant with a very comfortable bed/pillows. The bathroom is unlike any hotel I‚Äôve stayed in, with unusually high water pressure for achy muscles after long days. The bathroom was my favorite. My only advice would be to bring electric socket converters, as there‚Äôs only one American outlet in the room. I would absolutely recommend this hotel for your entire Ireland stay, which is what I wish we had done. Thank you to everyone at the Marker who made our trip extra memorable! ",5,2019,09,10
206,Best Hotel!!!,"Great location, quiet, clean and modern! Rooftop yoga was amazing in the morning and Rooftop bar at night is a must! Even the downstairs bar is very classy! The rooms are spacious, clean and modern - one of the BEST hotels I have stayed  at in a long time!!!",5,2019,09,10
206,Weekend stay at The Marker,"Excellent Service and Quality for Check in to Check out. We had a great experience. Breakfast was nice and dry with food being replenished often. The waiters were on hand and offered a great service both at the bar, Brassiere and indeed room service. Will certainly be back  ",5,2019,09,10
206,Marker hotel,"Had a bad experience here with some staff. I complained to the management and it was resolved immediately the staff removed and totally managed properly. The marker is happy and so am I which is brilliant Sandra Murphy is an absolute legend and I was delighted to meet her. Well done the marker hotel and staff

206,Lovely hotel,"Start in the Marker Hotel for the 1st time last weekend . What a beautiful hotel. 
Very friendly staff, great service, great location.
The bed in the hotel room was fabulous which I believe is the vital to any hotel
Highly recommend this hotel 
",5,2019,09,05
206,High end hotel that meets every expectation you might have,"Starting from the first second as I was greeted by doorman, everything was perfect. Staff is friendly and helpful (it was my first time in Dublin so I had a few questions and everything was covered with ease). There's not much to say about The Marker besides that it was worth it and I would choose this place again.",5,2019,09,02
206,Incredible,"The Marker is by far the best hotel I've ever stayed in. The staff was very welcoming and attentive, the rooms were immaculate, and the food was delicious. The staff at The Marker helped me prepare the perfect wedding proposal on their rooftop bar. 5 stars all around!",5,2019,08,28
206,Lovely Stay in this Beautiful Hotel,"Outstanding hotel!  Beautiful, clean and spacious room,  Very friendly and efficient staff.  Loved the buffet breakfast at the Brasserie, enjoyed drinks and food at the Bar and had fun gazing at the views at the Rooftop Bar.  Quiet location, away from the center of town.",5,2019,08,26
206,Pure Luxury,"I can't find superlatives enough for The Marker Hotel. From the minute we arrived where we were greeted by a very friendly Doorman who took our car from us and brought us in to check in to the moment we left sent on our way with complimentary water for the journey by the same friendly Doorman - we felt totally welcome and at home.

The staff without exception were all brilliant to us, nothing was too much trouble and everything was carried out with a smile.

The rooftop bar is exceptional. We went up for afternoon drinks and also were able to prebook a table for after the show we were attending - and finished the night off with a nightcap looking out over the city lights.

We had a lovely meal in the Hotel Brasserie. For a pre-theatre menu it was perfect, served in ample time and the dishes were really well presented and cooked to perfection. 

There was a huge range of drinks, a wide diversity of food options and a really good breakfast too - we couldn't fault any of the food or drink we were served.

The rooms were very comfortable - a well stocked mini bar and a Nespresso machine. A 32 inch telly, gorgeous bathroom and very comfortable pillows and beds. When we returned from the show for the night there were slippers left out for us and the next morning a newspaper awaited, hung on the front door for us.

In all I can't say a single bad word about the Marker, nor would I try. You completely get what you pay for - granted it's not cheap, it's a 5 star Hotel, but - it is without doubt as another reviewer said - the most 5 star experience I've ever had in any Hotel I've stayed in. 

Can't wait for our next visit, we will 100% be back and wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hotel without reservation to anybody looking for a luxury getaway - especially if you are combining it with a show in the Bord Gais theatre.",5,2019,08,25
206,Amazing Stay!,"Amazing stay at the Marker for my birthday. Room, food and staff were brilliant. Great attention to detail, lovely decor, super modern, highly recommend. 
Went to the rooftop bar and it was unfortunately rainy so there were not many people there but they still have blankets and created a cozy atmosphere.
Am yet to visit the spa but will be back !",5,2019,08,25
206,Lovely night in the Marker,"We stayed in the Marker at short notice and everything was faultless.  The concierge knew how to direct us to teh restaurant, umbreallas were provided for the rain, the staff were great and whilst it was literally just bed and breakfast, hard to fault it.",5,2019,08,24
206,Wonderful stay for our wedding anniversary,"The hotel was beautiful, the service was flawless and the staff could not have been more helpful. My wife and I were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary and our first night away from our children in literally years. We were greeted with complementary wine and on our return to our room after dinner, the beds had been turned down and rose petals and chocolates arranged in the shape of a heart on the bed. It really made our day.

 

We are by no means globetrotters, spending 99% of our time raising our young family but we have been lucky to spend a night or two in some really nice hotels over the years.  I have to say that our stay at The Marker was the most 5 star experience I‚Äôve ever felt at a hotel. ",5,2019,08,23
206,A very good address in Dublin,"It is a very nice modern hotel, a little out of town but very quiet. The staff is cordial and attentive. Spacious rooms with exceptional bedding.
This hotel was my last stop on a 3 week trip to Ireland and I will keep a positive review on this one",4,2019,08,21
206,"Great Hotel in a brilliant, quiet location!","Great hotel, great service from the team, rooms very good, very clean and also a very good size. Although a relatively large hotel, it doesn‚Äôt feel it. Staff are knowledgeable and friendly and the location in the Grand Canal Dock is perfect for the Boird Gais Theatre or about a 15-20min walk into town. Easy access to walk down the canal or river from the hotel.",5,2019,08,20
206,"""When in Dublin""","The Marker is the perfect Hotel in the perfect location, close enough to town to walk, yet far enough out to be quiet. I stay in a lot of Hotels around the world and this is one of my favourite, I just love this Hotel",5,2019,08,20

206,Spectacular Experience! ,"My wife and I loved this hotel. They have thought of everything: valet, room service, turndown service, heated floors in the bathroom, private car service and the concierge is extremely knowledgeable. Actually, Vladimir (from Concierge) was one of the highlights of our experience. Highly recommend a drink on the rooftop and a walk around the harbor. ",5,2019,08,19
206,Great hotel,"Nice spacious rooms in a new hotel, close to city center (walking distance), quiet, nice spa with large swimming pool and Jacuzzi, friendly staff at reception and dining area, nice rooftop bar and extensive breakfast.",5,2019,08,19
206,Best night sleep ever,"You really won‚Äôt want to get out of the bed it is that comfortable.  Breakfast was amazing with a great selection to choose from.  Food in the bar was also very appetizing. All staff are so friendly, courteous and welcoming.  This is my 2nd time staying at the Marker and certainly won‚Äôt be the last. ",5,2019,08,18
206,Top marks for the Marker,"This hotel sets the bar pretty high in all departments. Excellent rooms, smart ,friendly but very professional staff  coupled with a breakfast menu to suit all tastes and a rooftop bar giving views over Dublin. We all enjoyed our stay thoroughly.",5,2019,08,18
206,"Good location, expensive, lacked attention to detail","Nice hotel with a great location and friendly staff. However I stayed in a room with a shower which was part of a bath rather than a separate shower. The shower pressure was very weak and I believe the plug may have been clogged as the water just kept gathering submerging my feet in water.

I also found a ladies flip flop and used fake eyelash next to my bed which was from a previous guest staying in the room - not what I would have expected from this premier hotel.",3,2019,08,18
206,Good location for our needs,Had a wonderful stay at the Marker. Nice hotel location was great if like my husband you use the Wakedock on the Grand Canal. You are treated very well here and always in a friendly manner. We look forward to returning ,4,2019,08,18
206,Nothing special,Very overpriced. Definitely better deals out their. Service in some areas could be better. Phone reception was very poor. Roof top bar staff was nice. I would not recommend this to a friend. Very disappointed ,2,2019,08,16
206,Good business hotel,I always book here during business trips to IFSC. Far nicer than other hotels offered through my business booking option. SPA is very good and beds are wonderfully comfortable. Restaurant is rather pricey.,4,2019,08,16
206,Service acceptable but not exceptional!,"Facilities not available late on weekend.

Beautiful rooms but heating/air conditioning system made for a very warm or very cool room despite calling front desk! 
The concierge as however very helpful and sympathetic 

",3,2019,08,15
206,Weekend rugby stay,"The hotel is about 20 min walk to avia rugby / footy stadium.or the same to walk to city center ,the area as cafe bars food shops places to eat and the theater is next door .we stayed in room 501 which was quite this was my second stay in this hotel so that speaks for it self ,hope you enjoy Dublin plenty to do and the crack is good ",4,2019,08,14
206,A 5 star weekend break,"A perfectly located Hotel in the heart of Dublin City, that provides a high quality service in a very relaxing environment. All staff are well trained and mannerly.
Would highly recommend for a weekend break",5,2019,08,13
206,Exceeded all my expectations,"From arrival to departure, our stay at the Marker hotel couldn‚Äôt have been more wonderful. They made us feel like royalty! My kids never wanted to leave. They set up a teepee in the suite and had book and toys along with it. We can‚Äôt wait to return again!",5,2019,08,13
206,Superb hotel in great location,"I've never stayed in the Grand Dock area before - usually driven straight through!! However, because of availability issues with usual hotels, I stayed at the Marker. What a find - it will definitely be my hotel of choice for future visits to Dublin. Great central location with lots around for entertainment - bars, restaurants, theatre, not forgetting its own rooftop bar. The hotel itself is new but exudes luxury and comfort. Breakfast service was a bit ad hoc - there is a hot and cold buffet but you have to order if you want eggs other than scrambled, which took a long time and arrived duplicated! However, the food quality was excellent, so worth the wait. I thoroughly recommend this for anyone visiting Dublin. ",5,2019,08,13
206,Marker Hotel,"Stayed here for a business trip, so the location was ideal for what I needed it for. The hotel was really good quality, it has a lot of good facilities that were very good and the quality of service and food was excellent.",5,2019,08,12
206,Elegant Hotel with Highest Levels of Guest Service,"I had the pleasure of staying here for business and was greeted the most friendly doorman as I pulled up in my taxi.  He naturally conversed with me and took me to reception, introducing me to his colleague and making the hand over seamless.  Check in was friendly and easy.
The room was well appointed and there are so many plug points with multiple UK & Euro options.
Rooftop bar has a beautiful outlook and the service is very attentive.  Even received blankets as the evening cooled.
Breakfast is great with a wide selection and yet more great service. 
I can't wait to come back to this hotel again soon.",5,2019,08,11
206,Stunning and modern hotel.,"Great location, great service, upscale style and sleek design. Amenities abound - rooftop lounge, spa and pool, superior rooms. We went with another couple touring Ireland, Dublin was our last stop. This hotel was a delightful end for our trip.",5,2019,08,11
206,Good spot,I was going to a show in An Bord Gais theatre recently so we decided to go to the Marker hotel to have a bite before the show. We got a table in the bar area assisted by a very nice waitress. They have a good bar menu which is great if you want food but not a 3 course meal. We shared a lovely charcuterie board . A good mix of hot and cold food accompanied by lots of bread. We also had some sweet potato fries which were good. It was ideal for us and we found the standard very good.We also found the staff extremely friendly and charming.,4,2019,08,11
206,Upmarket and Groovy Dublin Marker !!,"Stayed 2 nights recently on my 1st ever visit to Dublin and it‚Äôs a decision that made my Dublin visit much more enjoyable. Marker occupies a wonderful location adjoining the grand canal waterfront. Loved the room - it was spacious, modern and well decorated. Rooftop bar was super cool and convenient, enjoyed the food at their Brasserie restaurant and more importantly, huge thanks to the lady at concierge (sorry forgot her name) who helped book for me a VIP ticket for the Riverdance show one evening. Absolutely mesmerising show and overall hotel stay combined! ",5,2019,08,10
206,Surbooking,Arrived at 7pm after having called to confirm the room at 3pm and were told to go to another h√¥tel outside of Dublin because of a ¬´¬†¬´water leak¬†¬ª. √Ä water leak in Dublin :-). Very disapointing as it was our highlight h√¥tel r√©servation of our trip. You should not be exposed to surbooking for a 329 euros room,1,2019,08,10
206,Amazing Roof-Top lounge,A great well appointed hotel in a great location with excellent staff members.  The concierge helps us plan out plenty of wonderful days trips in Ireland during our stay.  We were able to take in a show at theater located directly next door to the hotel.,5,2019,08,09
206,Fabulous hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and had a fabulous time , hotel, staff and everything about this hotel was spot on. Will certainly recommend to friends and family and if we come back to Dublin we will be staying here again.",5,2019,08,09
206,Wonder stay in Dublin.,"We spent two nights here while wrapping up our first trip to Ireland. We loved everything about The Marker Hotel. The rooftop bar is spectacular and our room was gorgeous. The staff is very helpful and attentive any obviously well trained. In our rush to catch an early flight, we left our purchased gift items behind. A call from the airport was all that was needed to be sure that our purchases will be shipped to us immediately. First Class Service.",5,2019,08,08
206,Mr Joe,"Mid week visit following s prior business Dinner a week ago.Pre -theatre dinner 

Well delivered good quality food.Expensive for the area and the restaurant was pretty empty but I was a Monday 

I liked it but not for the folk on a budget 

",3,2019,08,07
206,Why?,"Can‚Äôt figure out why (unless they had business in one of the many office buildings located near the Marker) any tourist would opt for this location. Why did we? Part of a Race and Stay package; but, earlier in our trip we stayed at the Westbury, which made more sense geographically. The hotel itself is modern and clean- rooms are large and comfy. Absence of a concierge for 2 of our 3 days there wasn‚Äôt desirable, but perhaps this was an exception. Breakfasts were decent. Bottom line, we‚Äôre I to return to Dublin I would never choose this location again.",3,2019,08,07
206,The most wonderful hotel,"I was a director of a major Irish public company for the past 6years visiting the Marker 8-10 times pa.

Wonderful location, great modern very comfortable rooms with latest in mod cons.     A terrific indoor pool/spa and fantastic roof top bars. Great atmosphere. So much nicer than the other 5 star stuffy overpriced Dublin hotels. The staff are lovely too. Highly recommended",5,2019,08,07
206,Wonderful stay at the Marker,"Lovely weekend in Dublin staying at the Marker. The hotel and very comfortable and provides everything you need to relax and have the best stay.
The room was perfect, really good breakfast and super relaxing time in the Spa.",5,2019,08,07

206,Wonderful Professional Staff,"Had a fantastic experience at the Marker Hotel Rooftop Bar last weekend. Such a wonderful atmosphere. They seem to have a policy which doesn‚Äôt allow over crowding, so it means everyone has enough space to really enjoy the venue. It was the staff that really impressed me ....such professionalism...like I haven‚Äôt seen in a while..in particular, Ray, Jamie and Derek. I will definitely be back. 

Thank you!

206,"The best spa massage ever - thank you, Ayu!","I have stayed in numerous of best hotels in the world and I am certain that the best massage I ever got was from Ayu at the Marker spa. It was also far better quality than any other physiotherapy deep tissue massage I ever received too. Ayu is simply the highest class massage professional I ever met. Her ability to ease shoulders and neck tension in just 30 minutes of sessions is outstanding. I visit Marker spa regularly now because each time Ayu carries out massage I get a priceless feeling of relaxation comparable perhaps to one week holidays. 
Thank you, Ayu for your outstanding quality service and Marker spa for attracting such high-quality professionals. ",5,2019,07,27
206,A real treat!,"I was given a gift voucher for my 60th birthday and what a treat it was....I couldn't fault anything. The pool is fantastic....so relaxing and staff were par excellence throughout. Would recommend this hotel for the location and the facilities but even more for the friendliness of the staff....fair dues to them!
",5,2019,07,26
206,Lovely Short Break,"We have just enjoyed a lovely short break at the Marker. 
The staff, location, room & facilities exceeded our expectations.
We would highly recommend the Marker for anybody wanting to enjoy Dublin, but avoid the noise, hussle & bussle of other city hotels. - 5 stars",5,2019,07,25
206,Roof Top Bar,"Just went for a cocktail on the rooftop bar.   Great experience, lovely staff and wonderful cocktail.  Blankets if you not lucky enough to be by heater.  Prices pretty good for the hotel and in Dublin.  Just check if any private functions going on. We were not staying at this hotel.  Thank you.",4,2019,07,25
206,The Most Fantastic Experience!,In all my life I have never experienced such attentive and pleasant staff. I always find the service is what makes The Marker special. I have been before to the restaurant and rooftop bar but never stayed nor been to the spa. I cannot speak highly enough of my stay there and I cannot wait to be back! ,5,2019,07,23
206,Excellent stay,"From start to finish a great hotel and it is obvious that it is a very professionally managed hotel. Happy and engaged staff who were knowledgeable and professional combined with an exceptional product and facilities to provide an outstanding  customer experience.

",5,2019,07,23
206,Fabulous,It's pricey but worth it.  Terrific staff and will accommodate early check in for transatlantic travelers. Its 10 minutes to Trinity/Grafton street and there is a Fresh Market right by the hotel for provisions.  Outstanding.,5,2019,07,23
206,New Job + First time visit to Ireland!,"Overall I had an amazing experience at the Marker. This was my first time visiting Dublin and first week in a new job. The hotel staff was incredibly kind, accommodating and warm. The rooms were tasteful and the food was delicious. Although I had one hiccup with the terrace doorman this was quickly rectified. I will definitely like to stay again. ",5,2019,07,21
206,Mid-week break,"This hotel is fabulous, in a great location and very friendly staff. Rooms are top notch. I will certainly stay again. We were made to feel so welcome and the staff each morning always greeted you with a smile.",5,2019,07,20
206,Bollinger Champagne Dinner,"Went to the Bollinger Champagne Dinner on the 11th of July. It was a brilliant evening. The food was amazing and now I know, I can drink champagne with each course. The staff were lovely. Thank you for a brilliant evening and I hope I'll be at your next Champagne Dinner.",5,2019,07,20
206,Beautiful Hotel in a great location,"The hotel is in a great location, not a far taxi ride or walk from the main areas. We were able to walk to Temple Bar district and Trinity college area with no issues. The hotel rooms were grand, clean, and comfortable. We enjoyed our stay very much!",5,2019,07,19
206,Overnight stay,"Stayed one night as we were attending a concert in the three arena. 
Quite small functional room in a contemporary design. The air conditioning worked well as the windows could not be opened. The tea and coffee making facilities were great with a well stocked Nespresso machine, but the honesty mini bar/snack prices were horrendous! But I suppose you have to expect this in a city centre hotel.
The bathroom was amazing though, almost as big as the bedroom. Beautifullly designed and decorated with  a big shower, lovely toiletries and adjustable underfloor heating. Bliss!
I hated the black corridors , I felt like I was traveling down to Hades, it gave me the creeps!
The bar food was lovely. Bar very busy just got in before the pre theatre rush. Service was good but the area was freezing cold as the front door was open all the time and the wind blew in. They really must put a revolving door in as this would kill the draft completely.
Check in and out was swift and pleasant and the concierge service was excellent. Quite expensive overall but it‚Äôs a Dublin city hotel so you can‚Äôt expect to pay much less. I‚Äôd go back if someone else paid the bill!",4,2019,07,18
206,Marvellous ,"What a lovely Hotel and what a location in the redeveloped Docklands south of the ‚Äúsniffey‚Äù. Fabulous amenities from pool to the roof top bar, what else could you ask for aside from friendly yet professional conduct of the staff. The room was spacious and the essential air conditioning was well received to ensure a good nights sleep in a comfortable bed. The pool and hot tub helped to relax and prepare myself and my wife for a few cocktails in the roof tap, which offers great views of the immediate city and the Wicklow Hills beyond. I highly recommend this Hotel as a base to explore Dublin. ",5,2019,07,17
206,Marker hotel,Beautiful hotel in Dublin City centre. Brassiere restaurant was delicious and breakfast the next morning was excellent with a very good selection. Room was spacious and clean which was appreciated especially when traveling with a baby,5,2019,07,15
206,An excellent place to recover from jet lag.,"We booked the Marker Hotel through our air miles program, and had no expectations other than it had a sauna. We were pleasantly surprised to find it also had a pool, steamroom, hot tub, and rooftop bar. We arrived at the Marker in a debilitated condition after an nine hour  over-night flight, that was preceded by sitting in the plane for 3 hours prior to take off.  After an hour in the pool, sauna, steam room, and hot tub we were back to normal. 
The Marker concierge got us a table at an excellent restaurant that normally has a six month waiting list, and the next day she provided us with a sightseeing itinerary that  impressed us. That afternoon she booked us a reservation for dinner at another popular restaurant. The rest of the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.
The Marker Hotel building itself is an architectural marvel.The lobby area is very bright and there are a lot of black surfaces within the hotel as well. I soon noticed that this had a very relaxing effect. We will stay there again. The only change I'd make would be to give the recorded voice in the elevators an Irish accent.",5,2019,07,14
206,"Great position, noisy rooms","PRO: The location is in the new part of Dublin, close to the Convention Centre.
The staff is very professional and friendly and Mr Amatore was extremely helpful

CONS: The rooms are not soundproof.
I couldn't sleep well as the person in the room next to mine snored the first night, and had the TV at a very high volume on the second.
No plugs close to the bed.",3,2019,07,13
206,Short Business trip,"Very Good hotel, in a great location. Excellent staff and service from the staff as you would expect of a hotel of this quality.

Would certainly return again 
Make sure you go and visit yamamori as the sushi and service were amazing there too ",5,2019,07,09
206,Fabulous experience,"I can wholeheartedly recommend the Marker Hotel from the first experience being the Valet parking, then the Concierge, the Reception and check-in, the Rooms, the Bar, the Rooftop Bar, it's Location, then the car being brought back by the Valet. All perfect.",5,2019,07,09
206,FANTASTIC 5* HOTEL ,"We have just returned from another stay at The Marker Hotel in Dublin. We last stayed here a few years ago,  when we were going to watch The Eagles at 3Arena. Last night, we returned to the 3Arena to see The Eagles again and booked another stay at The Marker Hotel.
This is a beautiful hotel, ideally located in the rejuvenated Docklands area. It is adjacent to Bord G√°is Theatre in Grand Canal Square, but just a short walk to the 3Arena. We love this hotel, the staff are amazing. Highly trained, pleasant and friendly and cannot do enough for you. The hotel has many outstanding features, the Rooftop Bar is a real asset with fabulous views serving wonderful drinks and cocktails and food. There is also a lovely downstairs bar, also serving food. The staff provide excellent complimentary nibbles whilst you enjoy your drinks. We had reserved a table in the Brasserie, for pre theatre dinner for 5.30pm. The menu was very good, 2 courses for ‚Ç¨32 or 3 courses for ‚Ç¨36. I wish I could have made room for the 3rd course, but after a delicious meal....no way. Both my husbands and my own meal were exceptional. Fresh ingredients, filling flavour and beautifully presented. Faultless. Breakfast this morning was also served in the Brasserie. Fantastic choice of cooked items along with a very very good continental buffet. A la carte was also available. Staff here were kept extremely busy but once again, nothing was too much trouble. (Coffee was very good)
All in all we really rate this hotel. It thoroughly deserves its 5 star rating, the professionalism of staff shone and it has a huge team. The hotel itself is modern and trendy. Our bedroom was impressive, the bathroom was huge, containing both a massive bath and an equally massive walk in shower. The room was immaculate, complimentary plate left for us welcoming us back to the hotel. ( pic) 
Complimentary bottle of water, tea, coffee milk etc and a very tempting mini bar. Slippers, Malin & Goetz toiletries. We would most definitely recommend The Marker and look forward to returning again soon. Hopefully The Eagles will also return.",5,2019,07,07
206,Beautiful hotel!,The Marker is a beautiful hotel about 15 minutes from the central Dublin attractions and I chose it for being close to 3Arena. Great spot for anything in the area. Luxurious beds & wonderful staff who are friendly & willing to help at any time. ,5,2019,07,06
206,Weekend break for birthday,"Excellent location, clean and bright rooms, lovely breakfast selection. Great service and rooftop bar with great views. Staff were very friendly fast check in and we arrived early and were given an early check in.",5,2019,07,03
206,Great Hotel,Great hotel with friendly helpful staff. Easy to get into central Dublin. Roof top bar well worth a visit for early evening cocktails. Very good spa and pool. Look forward to returning in the near future.,4,2019,07,03
206,A fantastic hotel in a great location,"Went for a mum and daughter spa weekend.

Great location in a really up and coming area of Dublin right near the water.

A nice 15 minute stroll into the centre with the bars abc shopping.

Roof top bar really pleasant and the choice of drinks excellent.

The spa was nice but I would ask for more information on the treatments as it was not forthcoming however really good products used 

Brassiere very nice food and the bar was good atmosphere.

We had a superior twin room which was lovely and the bathroom even had underfloor heating.

Definitely return   ",5,2019,07,02
206,Top class,"The hotel itself is superb, but the best thing about the experience is the staff. The tone was set by the team member who parked our car and introduced us to the reception staff. Everyone we met after that was equally friendly and helpful",5,2019,07,02
206,First class stay at the Marker,"Amazing stay at the Marker Hotel, property is first class and we were made to feel special from check in right through to check out.  All staff were friendly, professional and went above and beyond to make our stay a memorable one!  Lovely stay, will be back!",5,2019,07,02
206,Best weekend ever,"I asked my partner to marry me at this hotel. It could not have gone better, the staff (Tony, Louise and catriona) were amazing in helping me pop the perfect proposal. So attentive and helpful, thank you all. The rooftop bar was the perfect setting afterwards where we had more amazing service and spectacular views! An amazing hotel for any occasion ",5,2019,07,02
206,All fabulous until Rooftop restaurant being closed to Residents and double charge on checkout. Not explained clearly.,no access to rooftop terrace as a resident just before closing time for last orders. I had three good friends with me. Two cards debited on departure. Not explained properly to me on checkout. Still waiting on hold to lift on my Visa Card - so it appears I spent over 800 for one nights stay....,5,2019,07,02
206,Amazing Stay,"Stayed for business recently. Amazing Hotel and staff. Check In was efficient and professional. Loved The Decor, Room was Spotless, Bathroom had lovely touches. Breakfast had a great selection of hot and cold food. Again service was very efficient. Darragh Corcoran and Orla McAndrew were amazing, made the stay very special. Nothing was too much trouble. ",5,2019,07,01
206,As vibrant and fun as the city its in.,"A very modern hotel inside and out. The Marker is located in the area of Dublin called Dockland. It is right on the river in and area of town that in architecturally interesting with a very hip and vibrant feel to it. It is about a fifteen minute easy walk to the historic area of the city. However, I highly recommend a cab ride. Every one of the Dublin cabbies we met were our idea of what an Irishman  should be: fun, great story teller, great sense of humor.

We were celebrating our thirty fifth anniversary and we were upgraded to a luxury corner suite room. The room was huge, with modern electronics, great views, comfortable bed, great bathroom and colorfully and nicely furnished.

All of the staff from reception, porters, waitstaff, spa staff etc. were truly nice folks who knew the hotel business and how to relate to guests. 

The roof top lounge was beyond cool. Great service, great views of the city in a comfortable out door venue. Also, the bartender knew how to mix a drink.No cheap pours he.

They had a great gym which we took full advantage of. Modern, well conditioned equipment.

The buffet/ a la cart breakfast was top class. Huge choices of fresh fruit, bake goods etc. The waitstaff at breakfast were very pleasant and helpful.

We want to thank the staff for helping to make our stay in Dublin and our anniversary so special. We highly recommend this great hotel.

206,Skip it and stay somewhere else,"Because it's near the Facebook and Google workplaces in Dublin, this high-tech hotel aspires to a five-star and modern experience, but it does not succeed.  The prices for sure are five-star but the staff is not ready for prime time.  Everything is overpriced for what it is; the room has beautiful big windows that do not open and fresh air is not possible; the bathrooms are poorly designed with no towel bars, no grab bars in the shower nor the awkwardly high tub; the room is poorly lit for work or reading; the room price of bed and breakfast is not honored and we were charged for breakfast anyway, etc.  The ""concierge"" was not local and not very well trained.",1,2019,06,28
206,Fabulous hotel with wonderful staff,"Have just returned from a nights stay at The Marker - wow wow wow wow!

The rooms are stunning!  We stayed in the Presidential Suite which was truly amazing! 2 beautiful bedrooms, living room and dining room.

From the minute we checked in until we left the staff were amazing - To name just a few Chloe & Nicole at check-in.  Lyndsey in the restaurant on Wednesday night - great customer service from these three lovely ladies - sorry everyone else I didn‚Äôt get your names!!

Rooftop bar was amazing, we were fortunate the weather was so good, it felt like the Costa Del Dublin!!

Spa facilities are great, lovely big pool, jacuzzi and steam/sauna rooms.

Area surrounding the hotel is lovely as well - not that we went out during our stay - we didn‚Äôt need to.

Well done The Marker and Thank-you!!",5,2019,06,28
206,Great stay at Marker Hotel,Great stay at Marker Hotel. Excellent room and amenities but a bit far from the downtown to walk. A few restaurants in the area and a nice pub but in order to get downtown it was a 20 minute walk. That‚Äôs ok if it‚Äôs not raining. ,5,2019,06,27
206,"Superb business hotel, walking distance to town but away from the tourist buzz ","This was one of my favorite hotels in Dublin. You are about 20 to 30 minutes walking from the central tourist areas in this incredibly welcoming walking town. Yet you are in the heart of buzzing business district populated by companies like Google and Facebook. The rooms are great, with comfortable beds, great WiFi and nice extra amenities - including a terrific spa area and great service. ",5,2019,06,27
206,Perfection!,"Based on it‚Äôs rating, we chose this hotel for a quick visit to Dublin. I prefer modern, boutique hotels, and though the Marker is not a small hotel, if was perfect!  We did a pay-ahead, no-refund booking which afforded us breakfast and preferred access to the Rooftop bar.  This was well worth it as we were able to take advantage of both.  After an overnight flight from the US, we arrived very early, at 8:00 am, well before the 3:00 check in time, but were accommodated by having access to the Spa until our room was ready.  We were thrilled to get a call by 10:30  that our room was ready!  We also were easily accommodated with a last minute request for an extra bed. The bed was ready upon our arrival, complete with robe and slippers!  Though this hotel is not in the heart of tourist attractions, it is an easy walk to all of them and in a desirable location with great views.  ",5,2019,06,27

206,A Class Act,"Our first trip to Ireland, and how fortunate to begin it at The Marker. Cab from airport to The Marker, hours before check-in, and still they had our room ready to go. Staff delightful, room airy and modern and comfortable with just the view we requested, over Canal Square. The lights out the window at night were just a joy. The food, breakfasts and dinner, at the Brasserie sumptuous and graciously served. The bathroom was warmly heated underfoot, large and lovely. The pool was a particular joy. We checked out on Rooftop Bar opening night. Bad planning on my part! Next time, I hope. Thanks for all at The Marker. A true class act.",5,2019,06,24

206,work trip,"the hotel is located a little bit out of the way of the main attractions in the Grafton street/Temple Bar area but it has its charms.  close to the IFSC and the Liffey.  Nice, well appointed rooms that are beginning to show some wear and tear, great big bathrooms and nice amentieis.  the Rooftop bar is a draw, if you can brave the Irish weather.  ",5,2019,06,19

206,Clean but expensive.,"very clean hotel, great staff. Overpriced though unless it was a business trip. A good twenty minute walk into the city centre. However, all of the staff were very good and polite and couldn't be faulted.",3,2019,06,19
206,Marks for The Marker,"The Marker Hotel has a good reputation in Ireland. It's location is excellent, on the edge of the Grand Canal Basin, next door to the Bord Gais Theatre & close enough to the city centre. The DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) can be accessed at Grand Canal Station nearby. However, guests of the hotel, which is expensive, will more likely be using taxis.
            The hotel has a rather unusual geometric design which may not be to everyone's liking. The corridors are black with very dim lighting.
            The Rooftop Bar (open when weather conditions permit) is stunning with superb views. It has proved to be a very popular spot, which has led to the unusual feature that if you are staying in the hotel, one has to go to the ground floor to access a separate lift (operated only by staff) to reach it.
             The rooms are fine, but nothing extraordinary. A good bathroom with an excellent shower.
             Staff are uniformly excellent with great attention being paid to guests at all times.",5,2019,06,18

206,Excellent stay again at The Marker,"I think this hotel was even better than when I stayed the last time 2 years ago.  The room, location, and food were all very good.

206,Exceptional service,"Good location, exceptional service but our bathroom shower was the only disappointment.  Beds are very comfortable.  Tiny bathroom has a shower design problem, door opened into the shower and one has to step under the running water which caused water on the bathroom floor.   Concierge Vladimir was very friendly and very competent in getting restaurant reservations and giving us needed information.  Front desk was also very helpful and friendly.  The roof top bar is a must, good cocktails and the view of city is a must.  Ana gave me a very good massage in spa.  ",5,2019,06,14

206,Lovely Stay,"For a short stay, The Marker was perfect for work. The hotel was upscale and modern, close to many amenities and staff was very nice. I was near to the office which made it very handy. I loved the heated bathroom floor feature the most. I came during a bank holiday so I had a hard time booking a spa treatment. I would recommend booking in advance. ",5,2019,06,06
206,Excellent hotel,"This is an excellent hotel - great location, good facilities and service but it‚Äôs the staff that sets it apart. Everyone we met was friendly, attentive and genuinely interested in how they could help us enjoy our stay. Nothing was a problem and the attention to detail was impressive.

",5,2019,06,05
206,Excellent hotel ,"Truly deserves 5 stars. Very nice hotel in every respect- service, rooms, restaurants and bars, spa. All true luxury. The location is off the center and a 20 minute walk to Grafton Street area. It was nice being away from the mad tourist center but it did require quite a few taxis. ",5,2019,06,04
206,Great location and outstanding service for theatre and concert breaks in the heart of Dublin,The Marker is superbly located on the River Liffey next to the Bord Gais Theatre and a short stroll from the 3Arena for concerts and theatre breaks. It‚Äôs funky design elements compliment the five star service levels and ambience that permeate throughout the property. The Brasserie offers super quality food and efficient yet personal service for the ideal pre theatre meal. The lobby bar is a great chill out area. Rooms are exquisitely furnished and are spacious and comfortable. 5/5 for The Marker.  ,5,2019,06,04
206,simply wonderful hotel,"We stayed at the Marker the first weekend in Dublin. Great experience---beautiful room, welcoming and professional staff (thank you Fernando) and just a great hotel. A true five star  hotel.  We had a room with a view of the water. We liked it so much that we cancelled our planned return hotel to Dublin the following weekend and stayed at the Marker.

206,Perfection,"I visit Dublin frequently for business, and I have never had a more welcoming experience than at the Marker. The staff from beginning to end made my time at the hotel a pleasurable one, from checkin to the night at the Marker Bar.

The only negative was a bit of nonfunctional thermostat on my first night, which the Marker apologized for and fixed for the remainder of my stay.",5,2019,06,02
206,Luxurious property- ,Very grand and luxurious from the room amenities to the heated floor in the marble floored bathroom.  Rooftop bar is gorgeous- really nice cocktails.  The only complaint is room is too warm- coolest it gets is 16...for us too warm.  Would‚Äôve liked a little cooler.  It‚Äôs about a mile from temple bar area to walk.  ,5,2019,06,02
206,Absolutely excellent,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the experience was amazing. The most comfortable beds in Dublin. The facilities in the room were superb.

206,Relaxing night at The Marker Hotel,"We recently stayed at The Marker for one night, prior to a cruise.  The hotel was well-situated near the water, with a moderate walk to Trinity College and Temple Bar.  The room and bathroom were spacious and clean, and the bathroom had a heated floor.  The bed was very comfortable and was perfect to allow us to get some rest after our overnight flight, prior to getting out to explore the city and have dinner.  All staff members were friendly and helpful, and the breakfast buffet provided a good start to the day.",5,2019,05,29
206,wonderfull experience,"very good and confortable hotel Warm wellcome and very polite service. All was perfect and clean.

206,Amazing hotel ,"Stayed at the Marker Hotel for the Bank Holiday. As has been noted in other reviews the place is amazing. 

All the staff are so friendly and helpful. Nothing seems too much trouble for them. When I say ""all the staff"" I am of course including the staff that we do not see, without whom the Hotel would not run so smoothly. Special mention should be made for the Ladies on the front desk. Message to management look after them they are good. 

The Hotel is right opposite the Bord Gais theatre. Before the show starts the bar at the Hotel is packed it is impossible to find a seat. The Barman gave me a great tip when he told me to wait until the show starts then I should be OK.  The food in the bar is delicious. 

The bedrooms are nice and spacious. The bathroom even has underfloor heating. There is also a nespresso machine in the room. The beds are so comfy. 

The Hotel also has a lovely big pool which I think is longer than 'Olympic Size"". 

I will definitely be thinking of staying there again.

206,amazing hotel,"We stayed as a couple in The Marker for 2 nights
The hotel is beautiful, rooms are bright and modern
The pool and steam room are great after a day out
Staff is friendly and attentive but check-out took ages and should be improved
The hotel is a bit on the side of the city but the walk along the Liffey is great (not so great is you have mobility problems as the footpath can be a bit tricky) - we had no issue with it
We will definitely come back!!!",5,2019,05,24

Big bathrooms a bonus.

206,Exceptional Amenities & Stfaff,"The Marker is truly an exceptional hotel.  The amenities, the staff, and the service you get are wonderful and everything is 5-stars. Location-wise, it's a bit far from the hotspots of Dublin City Centre, but the infinity pool and the heated bathroom floors make up for some of it! Would definitely recommend.",5,2019,05,20

The breakfast is vast with a great choice of, well, everything! The restaurant is also nice for lunch - the arancini balls are delicious.

We‚Äôll be back. ",5,2019,05,12
206,Beautiful hotel but unfortunate service experience.,"Lovely accommodations. One of the reasons that we booked the hotel was for the spa services. It tuns out that the spa was closed during our stay. When we checked in, the lady at the front desk went through the available spa services and told us that we had access to the pool, etc during our stay. We also went into the spa area and asked another young lady for a brochure, which she gave us. Neither of them ever mentioned that the spa was closed. We only found out when we called to book services later that day. When we complained they comped us our bar tab which consisted of two glasses of wine. They also offered to put us up in the honeymoon suite with a view...but this offer happened late on our last night at the hotel. It was not worth packing all our gear as we were ready to go to bed at that point. ",3,2019,05,12
206,Pure Luxury,"Was here for more than a week on official vsiist to Dublin. One of the best hotels I have stayed in.

206,Fantastic Hotel,"The Marker Hotel is too fabulous for words. The room was spacious, quiet, and we were able to check in early which was very convenient. The hotel has an amazing spa with a 50 meter indoor pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna. The restaurant is lovely. The bar, especially the rooftop bar is magnificent. And the location away from the hustle and bustle of the temple Bar area ( but only a shortwalking distance away) was ideal. A great weekend at a great property.",5,2019,05,07

206,Disappointing,"The Marker Hotel, albeit modern and beautiful, didn't come close to the level of service we received at other Leading Hotels of the World. Service was not up to par.  No turn down service, even!  Coming from other excellent hotels and castles throughout Ireland, we were sorely disappointed in The Marker.  ",3,2019,05,01

206,Great Family Trip to Ireland,"We booked a trip to Ireland for March.  We decided to stay at the Marker due to the great reviews we saw on Trip Advisor and other sites.  We arrived at 5:30 Ireland time, not expecting our rooms to be ready and they were, we were able to take a much needed 3 hour nap to set our stay off right.  The Marker is a very pretty, chic hotel, great staff.  We loved the bar for nice nightcaps after our day's visiting Dublin City.  I did not visit the pool but my daughter did and she enjoyed it very much.  I recommend the Marker for anyone visiting Ireland.  It is not far from all the fun places and sights that Dublin has to offer just a quick cab ride.  ",5,2019,04,30

206,Great stay at the Marker,"Couldn't recommend highly enough. I visited for one night and it was great.

206,Luxurious ,"Neat chic hotel in an upcoming city neighborhood. Room was very modern, heated bathroom floors and great bath products made this feel very luxurious. Spa with lap pool, eucalyptus steam room and jacuzzi made it very relaxing. We didn‚Äôt eat here, opted instead for a high end grocery store less than a block away",4,2019,04,28
206,Memories are made of this,"Went here last weekend for my husbands birthday.
Even before our visit, the concierge has been on to finalize the finer details of our overnight stay - suggesting a teepee for our daughter. 
From checkin to checkout, we had a magical experience.  The marker fairy Aoife moved into our room with her fairy door. She left coins, sweets and lollies to greet us when we arrived and before bed left milk and cookies. 
We had a swim on both days - fab. 
Food in the restaurant was ok - there was a problem but quickly rectified.
We saw Dublin from the rooftop by day and by night. 
All in all, a total treat - staff were fab - not just friendly but over and above, with great ideas to make our visit better. 
A huge thumbs up from us üëç",5,2019,04,27
206,The Marker Hotel - the only upsetting thing that happened,"My trip to Ireland was absolutely amazing - my boyfriend surprised me by proposing! As if that wasn't the best surprise, he then followed up the weekend with friends and family surprising me over the next few days. He had chosen this hotel because we ""hadn't been away together for over a year"" (secretly I now know it was because he was proposing). The room was nice and very clean but cleaning supplies were left in the bathroom for two days. My biggest complaint was the service we received in the restaurant/bar and lobby. When one of my friends surprised me, we were in the hotel lobby enjoying a cocktail when she walked in. I immediately began to cry happy tears. The hotel staff immediately began to ask that we sign our check. After my now fiance let them know what the surprise was and why she had come they continued to push and it became VERY uncomfortable. Perhaps because we were not dressed in a suit? Feeling unwanted in the space and as if we were judged to not be able to afford the bill, we decided that we would head to our room. 3 lobby attendants and/or staff/security came running the the elevator bank aggressively to let us know that we were not allowed up with guests who were not staying in the hotel. all of this was very disappointing and such a let down. We decided to leave and hang out with our friend elsewhere for the remainder of the night. Upon returning and every time after, the doorman from that night left us so uncomfortable we barely wanted to go back to our room most days. All in all Ireland was absolutely amazing and I would go back 100000 times. It is on of the most welcoming cities I have every been to. However, I would not stay at The Marker Hotel. It was a very disappointing feature to our unforgettable weekend that my now fiance had planned for almost a year. It was the only bad part of our trip.",2,2019,04,24
206,Excellent but pricey,"Excellent but pricey; plus they charge extra for parking, room service etc. Beautiful food, room, service etc. 2 negatives; its all mechanically ventilated (beside the sea! I think thats a pity) and there is no unlimited water in the rooms (you have to request water apparently)",4,2019,04,23
206,Another amazing break!!,"Yet again the best stay in one of the finest hotels in the world, this was our second stay and I truly cannot fault anything about the hotel and its warm friendly staff ! The spa and pool facilities were very nice, rooms were immaculate, food fantastic and the roof top bar has the most amazing views, we will definitely be back again in 6 months, perfect base to explore such a lovely city... thank you !",5,2019,04,23
206,"again simply superb - personalised, responsive, delightful service","4th stay - as usual amazing. love this hotel - why? the staff are simply superb.
the hotel is well built, and in a great location - 10 min brisk walk to Trinity College and 15 min to Stephens Green, nice area and groovy coffee shops nearby and some nice restaurants. 
the hotel has all the usual mod cons.
the staff are simply superb - responsive. warm  and friendly 
its like coming home 
after a long haul flight ( think 23hrs from SYDNEY ) its a pleasure to come here.
will be back of course in 2020",5,2019,04,22
206,Lovely Birthday City Break,"We found the The Marker Hotel after a little search online and looking for somewhere with a pool. Our first impressions of the hotel were great and they stayed this way throughout. 
The rooms are a great size although the lights are pretty dim if the curtains are closed. There is a mini bar which you can use at an extra cost. I would suggest a trip to Euro Spar down the road or fresh rather than the high cost of this. But then again this is the same for any hotel mini bar. The beds are comfy.
The gym looked good however we didn‚Äôt use this. The pool was lovely although a little too cool. The hot tub was hard to get comfy in as risk that you would float off the seat. Steam room lovely too.
The rooftop bar was lovely. You get priority if you are staying in the hotel. They did try and tell us that the couple next to us would get priority as they are staying in the hotel assuming we were not which felt a little rude. 
Cocktails are lovely. We didn‚Äôt have the food but it looked good.
We would stay again. Only issue is it‚Äôs not close enough to the centre to walk in each day really. But the bus isn‚Äôt too far away. 
Thank you for the lovely birthday treat too.",5,2019,04,22
206,"Wonderful High-End Hotel, about a mile from Temple Bar","5 star stay, from location to linens, staff to amenities, facilities and food, this is a wonderful place to relax after a long day of exploring Dublin.  Bar can be a tad loud, but you won't hear that in your room.",5,2019,04,19
206,Amazing,"Gorgeous hotel. Clean, quiet and with incredibly comfy beds. Bathroom is amazing with walk in shower and bath! Spa is beautiful with one of the best steam rooms I have used. Treatments pricey but good, not sure they are worth the cost but probably a presumption of those who stays means. On the contrary the cost of the room is very competitive considering the quality thus very good value. ",5,2019,04,17

206,A delight!,"If the Marker hotel has a fault my family and I got nowhere near it.  From the moment of arrival being greeted and having my car valet parking organised by a friendly Doorman - the receptionists, waiting staff, bar staff, concierge, chamber staff and spa staff seemed like they might be the same friendly helpful, courteous person dressed in varying uniform disguises. The service standard here has been set high and honed into a seamless excellence. The attention to detail in our room and it‚Äôs general comfort was easily the best I‚Äôve ever experienced and I‚Äôve stayed in many. An absolute delight.",5,2019,04,16
206,What can I say but sensational experience!,"Pros: Stayed for 2 nights. Staff amazing, hotel spotless oozing luxury.
Spa amazing and wins annual awards. Great atmosphere in the bar. Weather not good enough for rooftop bar...next time!

cons: For a 5* hotel, hot breakfasts should come from the kitchen with each order, not from heated containers!!

I will defo be back, loved this hotel.",5,2019,04,15
206,Perfect,"In Dublin for a week long conference, and the Marker is just a great hotel. The location is perfect, just a 5 minute walk from the convention centre. The staff are all wonderful. I couldn't have asked for more.",5,2019,04,15

206,First choice for any type of stay in Dublin,"The marker is almost the perfect hotel. Don't judge this review by the first line, this is a fantastic hotel! The staff are brilliant and are very friendly. The food is amazing and the stay as a whole is a premium experience. The building itself feels like a haven of tranquility. only small things that bothered me, like no plugs at the bedside. An extra hour at breakfast would be ideal. The marker is without a doubt my first choice for any type of stay in Dublin! ",4,2019,04,11
206,Fantastic Family Break in Dublin,"The Marker Hotel is a hidden gem a modern oasis a Dublin experience. I do not use experience lightly but when you factor in the location, the people, the rooms, the bar , the food this is what a hotel is made of.It is simply quality if you stay there once it will be extremely hard not to return.",5,2019,04,08
206,Le Drunch experience,Very nice Sunday afternoon in The Brassiere in Marker Hotel. We had a sharing starter a main and a sharing dessert. The food was very good. The staff were attentive and friendly. They had a DJ  playing some good laid back tunes in the background. Nice way to spend the day.,5,2019,04,08
206,Exceptional Staff,"I visited the hotel on Saturday April 6th with some friends. We were keen to have drinks in the rooftop bar and terrace. On arrival we were welcomed by Raymond who was very a pleasant gentleman, he seated us while we were waiting for a table to become free. Once there was we were escorted to lift. Dermot greeted us upstairs and brought us to our seats. It was a lovely evening and the table service was excellent. We enjoyed a relaxing view of the city while being looked after by Gary who kept checking in with us ensuring that we were enjoying our evening. Overall a great experience in the Marker Hotel and looking forward to returning soon.",5,2019,04,07
206,Sewage,The bathrooms smelled like sewage. The smell went through the room and never left. The staff did not know but it was cleaned earlier by housekeeping. The smell permitted throughout the entire room and it was nauseating. ,1,2019,04,05
206,Fantastic hotel in Dublin,"We chose the Marker Hotel because it is close to Trinity College where my niece is studying. Upon arrival we enjoyed the spa/pool and a massage. It was the perfect way to rid oneself of travel stress. Every time we needed help, someone was there to assist us. We had a memorable trip and hope to return to the Marker Hotel in the future.",5,2019,04,03
206,Fabulous,"I‚Äôve been meaning to write this review for a few months now and could not let it go as my partner and I absolutely loved staying here. My partner travels to Dublin a few times a year on business and always stays at The Marker and this time I joined him.
A luxury modern hotel in a great location with the Bord Gais theatre directly opposite.  The spa with swimming pool was   luxurious and a lovely treat. Our room was very comfortable and spotlessly clean. 
The buffet breakfast was excellent and such a wide choice. We had lunch at the hotel which was just as good.  Staff attentive and friendly. 
Would I stay here again - most definitely! ",5,2019,04,03
206,great stay,"had a great stay looking forward to staying again , this was my second visit and i must say i had a great time , i was dissapointed that the resturant wasnt available but i left it late so that didnt help. On my next visit i will be sure to eat there",5,2019,04,03
206,Fabulous Hotel,"Excellent service. Great staff, very friend and professional. Such an enjoyable time will definitely be back. Spa is great, does not feel like you are in the middle of dublin city, so peaceful & relaxing",5,2019,04,02
206,Amazing!,"Very pleasant and enjoyable stay, staff are excellent! We stayed at the Marker as we we're attending a concert in the 3 Arena, the location is perfect and within walking distance. Did not eat in the award winning Brasserie but food in the Bar is excellent....along with the service! Would most certainly return. The interconecting rooms are ideal for familys, staff went above and beyond for my 6 year old! :-) He loved the turn down service with cookies and milk!",5,2019,04,02
206,Sisters stopover,"We had a sister stopover in the Marker hotel.  Our stay was Excellent from start to finish.  We ate in the bar and the food was delicious.
Our rooms were lovely 
We all had breakfast together as room service which was excellent ",5,2019,04,01
206,Amazing Experience,"Great stay, def recommend - great location - very friendly staff that is always willing to help at a moments notice. 
Great location, key to all very nice restaurants and tech industries.  Would recommend staying ",4,2019,04,01
206,"5 Stars, shame about the lighting!","This was my first time staying at the Marker, and it superseded my expectations.  Outstanding service and staff, wonderful food quality, impeccable setting and excellent location for Dublin city. The only point to raise, is the almost total absence of light in the bedrooms. Lights are at best dim, windows are narrow. No possibility to work or read in the rooms unless using one's phone as a torch. Make up application had to take place standing at a window using a handheld mirror! Not what I'd expect from a hotel of this calibre. Sort this out and the hotel will be beyond perfect.  5 stars given regardless, but 3 stars for an otherwise roomy, spacious and well appointed bedroom.",5,2019,04,01
206,Another Excellent Experience,"An outstanding hotel.  All staff responsive - clearly they enjoy their status as a fine hotel and contribute to it hugely.
It is expensive but I have never known Dublin to be anything else!  However if you pay up you will have an excellent experience.",5,2019,03,31
206,The Marker,Love staying here! The staff was super nice and they all had a smile. Can‚Äôt wait to come back and stay! The pool side service is great. I enjoyed the view! It is also in a great location. The Marker offers something for everyone,5,2019,03,31
206,Midweek stay,"Polite, professional and enjoyable stay. Staff were great,room was excellent, and good proximity to areas of interest. Will definitely return again when staying in Dublin, and would highly recommend The Marker if planning a visit to Dublin.",4,2019,03,31
206,Modern hotel in good location,This is a good modern hotel in the docklands area of Dublin. The facilities are excellent and the rooms of a high standard and very comfortable.Breakfast was excellent if a little overpriced and staff all helpful and considerate. Walk into the centre is quite far so if you don‚Äôt want to take a taxi go over the river and take a tram. There are some great shops there as well. Excellent base if you are going to the Point or the conference centre and right beside a theatre and restaurants,4,2019,03,31
206,Ok place,I wouldn't consider The Marker as very luxurious or central hotel. A lot of construction surrounding the area. Main attractions 15 minutes away.  Only redeeming qualities are the pool abd sauna facilities. ,3,2019,03,31
206,"Brilliant weekend at The Marker, as always!","Thanks again to all staff at The Marker hotel, we had a fantastic time there, as always! Everything was perfect, room, spa, food, location ... really looking forward to going back again soon. Paul and Maria Groves ",5,2019,03,29
206,"AMAZING HOTEL, AMAZING STAFF IT HAS THE WOW FACTOR","Just back from an overnight stay at this hotel , everything from check in to check out was fantastic we were lucky enough to get an upgrade and the rooms are all gorgeous.  Staff go out of their way to ensure you are having a nice time special thanks to the concierge guys they were soooo friendly and very professional",5,2019,03,27
206,Great hotel,"I have come twice to the marker and it has been perfect both times. The building is stunning, the service is very attentionate and the room is extremely clean, quiet and beautifull. What can I ask more ?",5,2019,03,26
206,Another great trip and stay in The Marker Hotel,"Hotel is exceptional. Staff are so pleasant and welcoming. Spa and pool area are top standard and the room offers a fantastic view and modern design, with a good quality bath and shower too.

We had a stay on the Saturday at a slightly cheaper than usual, but still expensive, rate of ‚Ç¨224. We also used the spa and had drinks in the bar. Exceptional hotel, we are always so impressed by the quality.",5,2019,03,26
206,The excellent staff & Management of the  Marker Hotel,"Absolutely excellent , we loved every bit of our stay. Totally professional and totally welcoming. Staff and Management  so professional. Our room was amazing and the special touches too, excellent in every way. ",5,2019,03,26

206,Very good location and quality,"I spent several business trips in this hotel between November 2018 and January 2019. 
The rooms are huge and very well furnished in a contemporary but cosy style. 
The location is perfect just by the dock and the personnel is welcoming.",4,2019,03,25
206,Marker Hotel weekend,"everything 10/10! From the check in process, to the parking, and sowing us to our room, the trip was very relaxing. The pool is brilliant and the rooms are just amazing, the bathrooms are lovely. Would recommend. ",5,2019,03,25
206,The best hotel in Dublin,"Quiet, modern, clean and only 20 minutes walk to th main areas of the city. 
  The room was spacious and comfortable with a good size warm bed .The room was quiet , in fact we never heard a sound from outside or another room during the four day stay. I doubt there can be any street noise anywhere in the hotel as it is such a quiet area . 
  Really handy for the restaurants around Charlotte Quay and Bord Gais Theatre which is a 2 minute walk. The bathroom complete with bath and shower(that depends on room standard) was just superb.
   We didn't eat in the hotel except for breakfast , but that was excellent with plenty of choice of cereals and fruit .
 The staff counldn't do enough and were extremely attentive when required  without overdoing it. The check in area with concierge servive came in really handy and helped us avoid a pointless trip to an attraction that had to be boked in advance (Kilmainham Jail) . ",5,2019,03,21
206,Fantastic hotel with outstanding staff,"I can not recommend this hotel enough. A fantastic location, brilliant facilities and outstanding staff and customer service. The rooms are outstanding, the spa and the rooftop bar make this hotel incredible. ",5,2019,03,21
206,Beautiful hotel,"From arrival to departure we had a wonderful stay with great food, delightful staff and relaxing spa area. The location is perfect for shopping, restaurants and the theatre within yards of the entrance. The complete experience is as always evident from arrival as the front desk reception are helpful and professional. I would highly recommend this hotel for a wonderful stay both business and pleasure. ",5,2019,03,18
206,Completely overpriced,"Stayed in the Marker Hotel on Saturday 16th March 2019, 450e for room only, no breakfast included.  Totally overpriced, expected more, no bath in room, just shower, a glass of sparkling wine 17e. We were not allowed access to the rooftop bar as they said not until April yet there was a private function on in the rooftop bar that night.  That is the reason we booked, to enjoy the rooftop bar.  The whole trip was overpriced for what it was. There was no access to open the window in the bedroom...Parking fee of 24 euro per night on top of room only fee of 450e is scandalous...",2,2019,03,18
206,Lads n Dads,Fantastic hotel. Great breakfast and great service. Very modern style and great decor. The waiters and the breakfast are brilliant. Only flaw in the hotel is the rooms are very well designed but not very practical. Powerpoints in the wrong places...no desks or worktops in the bathroom. In spite of this very luxurious and would stay here again.,4,2019,03,18
206,Nice hotel with great spa facilities and quite central.,Good hotel with very friendly and attending staff. Price a bit on the high side for a room w/o breakfast included. Also has a nice pool with spa facilities and a small gym. It is convenient next to shops and restaurants as well as offices in Grand canal dock side. ,4,2019,03,15
206,GREAT EXPERIENCE IN DUBLIN,"Oustdanding hotel with nice sport facilities and swimming pool, located at the heart of the Docks and not far from City Centre. Very modern and updated, large room with nice view, excellent bath room. Nice building architecture and roof top with an amazing view of the town.",5,2019,03,13
206,Wonderful hotel,We really enjoyed our stay in the Marker hotel. It has a great location and the staff could not have been more helpful or lovely. The rooms and decor are amazing and the rooftop bar is a lovely place to spend an evening. The spa and pool are first class. They even have a pic and mix section in the foyer. Can‚Äôt wait to go back! ,5,2019,03,12
206,The marker hotel ,"A quick walk to everywhere we wanted to go: the temple bar, ha penny bridge, trinity college, and much more! The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful! They park your car for you and give suggestions based on what you like to do. A little pricey; however, worth it. We would highly recommend! ",4,2019,03,12
206,Another wonderful stay,"Third stay at The Marker.  Such a lovely hotel.  Very much a 5 star but very relaxed and lovely, friendly staff. . Rooms overlooking the canal square are wonderful. Amazing, large bathrooms with heated floors.  Excellent breakfast with lots of choice. Will definitely be back again.",5,2019,03,11
206,Nice hotel,"Really enjoyed staying at the Marker, hotel
was beautiful and modern and the room was gorgeous. The bathroom was spectacular with underfloor heating and completely air conditioned. The only let down was it was just a little too far away from the main shopping area in Dublin, but a quick taxi ride and your there! The spa was also beautiful, very clean and modern! All interactions with staff were grand! Would definitely recommend with a note that it could be closer to the hussle and bussle!",5,2019,03,11
206,A night at theater,"This is our second visit ideal location for show at the Bord G√°is Energy Theatre. Staff friendly, fab pool and spa  the young guy from Split at front of house very helpful with luggage and taking cases to our car.  Rooms to side of building overlooking childrens' play are very quite. We stayed in room 229 Breakfast self service.. had a great selection Will be back.",5,2019,03,11
206,Meh,"Rooms were nice if a bit expensive for their value. Had several disappointing interactions with staff including when trying to get to the roof bar where several members of our party were interrogated on both ends of the elevator ride at different arrival times. Why not just ask for a name or room key? Very uneven meal in the brasserie. Two meals were put in wrong and another one we could not eat due to over cooked, dry fish and dry, unflavorful dish overall. Had to repeatedly ask for water refills, dishes to be cleared, etc. The restaraunt was not at all busy, and seemed well staffed, so I‚Äôm not sure why the service was so spotty. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend and won‚Äôt come back. ",3,2019,03,09
206,Great hotel for docklands,"Stayed here recently for business. Very lively bar in great location for docklands and excellent breakfast. 
Didn‚Äôt even get to see pool which is said to be fantastic. Next time I‚Äôm back I‚Äôm determined to get to see the pool. 
Not very convenient for main city centre and shopping areas. ",5,2019,03,06
206,A rare night away!,"As this was a rare night away with my, some would say, better half, price wasn‚Äôt the main value point. The level of service and friendly disposition of staff makes for a very enjoyable stay. One night was not enough! :-(",5,2019,03,06
206,Stay at the Marker March 2019,"I have been staying at the Marker for over 5 years now.  It has always been a wonderful place to stay with excellent rooms, very clean and contemporary finished.  The beds are very comfy and offer an excellent quality of sleep.  The hotel has a lovely pool and spa facilities although the gym is a little on the small side.  The staff are friendly particularly at breakfast where Sandra, Kristina or Simone will look after your needs.  The bar area is always busy and staff attentive to your needs.  I would, however, like to see the bar menu change regularly with some additional seasonal fare.  Overall I am very satisfied with the hotel otherwise I would have gone somewhere else.",5,2019,03,06
206,A romantic getaway to remember in the heart of Dublin,"My wife and I stayed in the Marker after the Fat boy Slim gig in the 3 Arena on Saturday night and we loved it, from the minute we checked in til the (much appreciated!) late checkout on Sunday, we were treated so well by the staff and enjoyed the fantastic rooftop bar and spa. Can't recommend this place highly enough whether you're visiting Dublin on a stopover or indeed a local looking for a nice break in your hometown!",5,2019,03,05
206,Luxurious city hotel with fabulous service,"This is a fantastic hotel, modern, airy and luxurious. My room was spacious bright and modern, with excellent toiletries a very comfortable bed and all mod cons. The wi-fi worked perfectly throughout the hotel. The food was delicious and the chef even came out to say hello which was a lovely touch. The bar by the entrance do get very busy especially as the hotel is right across from the theatre, but I am not surprised as the cocktails are as tasty as they are pretty (and lethal). There is also a swimming pool and a steam room and sauna for those of you who have some spare time. But what impressed me most was the friendly and attentive service throughout. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,03,05
206,Excellent!!!!,This hotel provided top class customer service with every staff member from the concierge to bar staff were very helpful and friendly. We stayed at the hotel for my partner's birthday and the hotel went above and beyond to make this a special occasion. The bar has a great atmosphere and buzz about it and the cocktails were amazing. The room was beautiful and spacious with great views and the spa was the perfect place to relax. Overall an excellent hotel!,5,2019,03,05
206,Great service and facilities,"Beautiful and well maintained hotel in Dublin.  Rooms and baths are lovely, spacious and very clean.  Facility is great with pool, suana and hot tub.  Service is excellent.  Probably would skip eating at the restaurant- was a bit odd, but otherwise a great stay. ",5,2019,03,04
206,Fantastic property - cannot recommend enough!,"Absolutely perfect place to spend a weekend in Dublin. The surrounding area is quiet yet close enough to all the amenities and has bord gais theatre right beside for a great evening, the property itself is stunning with great architecture and d√©cor within, both kept to a very high standard. The service is second to none and the food is amazing. You will not be disappointed staying here!",5,2019,03,02
206,Hard to think how to improve on this.,It is an excellent city hotel in every way. Very good service and excellent facilities. Unfortunately I have to make the review up to 200 characters but there really is no point. It is everything a sane person could want from a modern hotel in an excellent location.,5,2019,02,28
206,No roof top bar open..,"Nice Hotel, seems to be based on teather visitors. Desappointing to find out the Roof Top bar was closed. Did not use Brasseria. Nice service in the bar. All the appointed service did not fit the surroundings. Comforable room",3,2019,02,28
206,Lovely stay,"An excellent hotel, very efficient and courteous staff.  Room was beautiful and a real comfortable bed resulting in a great nights sleep.  Valet parking a real treat.  Lovely atmosphere in the hotel.  Excellent location, close to all transport.",5,2019,02,26

206,"Modern, well located hotel with excellent service","This was my second stay on business in the last three months. Received a very warm welcome, good hospitality and great service on request. Getting taxis and telling them about the hotel was an issue as one of the drivers did not know of this hotel.

Nice room size, good decor, outstanding tea and coffee facilities with newspaper made this a great hotel to stay in. TV had all the business channels plus access to modern streaming, Netflix etc. 

Will return if I am back for business in Dublin as it is very proximate to our office location too. 

AR,",5,2019,02,23
206,Five star hotels should do better than this,"Bathrooms without enough lights.
Turn down service didn‚Äôt work automatically. Cigarette smoke in room trough ventilation system. Hygiene products one pice for two persons. Top roof with no protecion,  to cold to be opend in winter.",3,2019,02,19
206,Nice but not in the same league as the other luxury hotels in Dublin,"Excellent rooms in a nice location. Clean and beautiful building. The service was grand but not at the levels you would see in the Westbury, Merrion or Shelbourne. Just misses that touch of class. I'm sure they will get better over time. Breakfast ok, nothing special. Bar packed with nowhere to sit. ",4,2019,02,19
206,Great Location,"Lovely hotel, great location, staff very friendly. Great location for a night out in Dublin. Rooms modern, clean, very comfortable. Sweet table in lobby area was a nice touch. Bar was very busy but nice food and drinks",5,2019,02,18
206,Mid week break,"My wife and I had a midweek break to the city. We found this hotel on the website by searching the best hotel in Dublin and we weren‚Äôt disappointed. The spa and wellness facility completely relaxes you from busy days strolling the city and shopping.
The bar and brassiere from staff to food and drinks is the best experience we have had. Room and other hotel areas are spotless and the staff are very attentive. Seriously can‚Äôt find fault, excellent hotel. ",5,2019,02,18
206,Excellent hotel ,"Excellent friendly staff 

Excellent check in service 

Excellent front door staff very polite and helpful 

Excellent room that is very clean and bright

206,Magical valentines,"My wife and I have stayed in the Marker on many occasions so we decided to avail of the exclusive valentines night package.  

Reasonably priced at just under ‚Ç¨450 for a nights stay in a double room with breakfast and a four course taster menu which included a complementary cocktail on the rooftop bar we jumped in the car and headed down.

Upon arrival we were greeted and my car parked for me by the helpful staff member.  The Marker have an extremely high standard and all of their staff are very knowledgeable, can hold an interesting intellectual conversation and genuinely are so helpful and fantastic, polite and all go above and beyond their role.  I have always found the management fantastic too and as regular visitors we are very well looked after.

Each time I visit the Marker I am blown away by something special - every time it is something different.

Upon arrival we used the gym facilities and health suite which of course are amazing, the dinner was exquisite and the rooftop bar is also Magical.  I could write a thesis on the Marker but you need to stay there to experience the magic.  From I walk in the door until I leave again, I am so relaxed and so well looked after.

The Marker is undoubtedly one of the best hotels in the world and I absolutely recommend the valentines or any package or stay.",5,2019,02,15
206,Fun location and incredible facitlity.,The rooms are so comfortable with great bathrooms.  Wow.  The pool and spa facilities are the best ever.  We loved everything.

The restaurant was great and even had a pre theater menu for people in a rush.  I would definitely come back.,5,2019,02,15
206,Home from home,There is something really nice about staying in a quality hotel in your home town. An excellent location particularity if you are going to the theatre opposite. The facilities are first class and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable. The style is contemporary and the architecture is pretty impressive     ,5,2019,02,14
206,Fantastic hotel!,"Consistently friendly service, well equipped spacious room, great guest amenities provided from the Nespresso machine in the room, to the fresh fruit and teas provided in the wellness area which in itself was so enjoyable with a fab pool, jacuzzi, steam and sauna areas. The hotel was spotless throughout, its obvious that high standards are valued here! Had room service which was also excellent.We were even treated to a pretty anniversary plate in our room as we were celebrating with a night away.

There is literally not one thing I can fault about our overnight stay! Thank you to everyone who made our stay memorable and so perfect!",5,2019,02,10
206,"Espetacular decoration, great rooms, great service","We stayed here for one night, the hotel is absolutely stunning the decoration is beautiful. The swimming pool is amazing. We had dinner in the room which we found to be not that expensive and food was amazing. The WiFi was super fast and you could even control the tv with your phone. Suberb in all aspects!!! Would definitely recommend this hotel!!!",5,2019,02,08
206,A great place to stay in Dublin,"Efficient, quiet, spotless, dedicated knowledgeable staff and good food. The rooms are fist class and all around tip top! They handled the madness and general mayhem of a Rugby Weekend with great wit and aplomb! Well done! It's a little further out than some but even that has it's own compensation, if you want to sleep, it is quiet enough to be able do so!",5,2019,02,05
206,Gem of a hotel,"Everything about this hotel is exceptional, from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave all the staff make you feel special.Would I recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of travelling to Dublin - Defiantly ",5,2019,02,05
206,Fantastic Hotel With Superior Service,"This was our second stay at The Marker Hotel. The hotel is very beautiful. But even more important to me is the service. Each and every employee we met was exceptional. We felt cared about and cared for....from morning till night. I've traveled around the world for business and pleasure. The Marker stands out for its service....bravo to its hiring department!  Don't think twice, do yourself a favor and stay there. You will love the experience.",5,2019,02,05
206,Brilliant Hotel and Beautiful Spa,"We had a great time in Dublin and a big part of it was the hotel. The staff were great and the spa was small but everything you need. 

It‚Äôs expensive, two G&Ts ordered to the room came to over ¬£40 but it‚Äôs mostly worth it.

Would highly recommend!",5,2019,02,04
206,Great hotel,"The Marker was a great place to stay for a weekend in Dublin. Bar and restaurant service were both great. It‚Äôs a bit of a walk into the city centre, but I didn‚Äôt mind. 

The indoor pool is also a definite plus. Overall it carries its 5 stars well.

",5,2019,02,01
206,Incredible Hotel,A wonderful experience from start to finish. The service was second to none and the room was lovely. Breakfast was beautiful and the bar service was prompt.  Only issue was they didn't have Gordons gin for my mum!! Highly recommend!,5,2019,01,29
206,Superb stay,If you want to really experience a top class hotel this is the place. Everything from the staff to the rooms to the spa to the furnishings is pure luxury. Not cheap! But you really get the best of everything.,5,2019,01,28
206,Good for a business trip,"This second experience was definitely better than my first visit. I am still confused by the 5-star rating. This is DEFINITELY not a 5 star property. The restaurant was closed every night this week forcing people to dine in the drafty lobby. The service is good however and the staff friendly. The atmosphere remains rather cold and impersonal; it feels more like a convention type of place than a ""classy"" 5 star property. My room was large and comfortable. I will stay there again for a quick business trip but not for a vacation or a special occasion as it feels like this hotel could be in any major city around the world.",4,2019,01,23
206,Lovely stay,"We stayed here for a night for my Birthday, for people who don‚Äôt know their way about Dublin, the hotel is a bit far out from the touristy places I.e Temple bar area etc, it will cost you approximately ‚Ç¨10-‚Ç¨15 in a taxi one way. But we didn‚Äôt mind. Any way on arrival the jeep was pre booked in to the car park so there was someone at the door waiting to take our car to the car park which was really handy. The hotel is super modern so if you are in to architecture I think you would like it.
 Reception staff are all lovely, We had our room already paid for but on check in they take a ‚Ç¨50 of your credit or debit card just incase you forget to pay for mini bar consumed items, which of course goes back on your card if you don‚Äôt. 
The room was lovely, quite big, very modern, good view, and had all the normal amenities and a coffee machine. Also waiting for me in the room was a Birthday gesture, which was really thoughtful. Though one thing I didn‚Äôt really like was the lighting at night was quite dark. Check in at 3pm check out is at noon. But they don‚Äôt be rushing you out and cleaners don‚Äôt be knocking on the doors 10 minutes prior like some hotels, which I liked. 
We didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel but we had a few cocktails which were really nice, there are a few really nice eats close by, HQ was one we went to for brunch it was delicious. 
The spa is beautiful and very relaxing. 
The roof top bar was closed.. it closes January to March,, So I was disappointed with that, but I had been pre warned by staff when they rang a few days before hand to confirm our booking, Over all we had a lovely time and we would stay again.",4,2019,01,19
206,Stylish & comfortable ,"My wife & I visited for one night at the start of January.

Pros

- stylish
- friendly and helpful staff
- clean & comfortable 
- waterside location close to the city centre
- tasty and varied breakfast
- easy parking

Cons 

- the restaurant food felt a little like style was winning over quality 

This is based on our own subjective & unique experience. To really know, pay a visit!",5,2019,01,17
206,Excellent Stay with excellent service,Stayed as part of the Pendulum Summit in the Dublin Convention Centre - while the stay was short everything was perfect. Stayed in a 1st floor room - no noise issues and the buffet breakfast was excellent while you could get items to order.,5,2019,01,16
206,best hotel in dublin,"My wife and I had booked into the Marker again after a previous stay.  We had tickets to see Les Miserables at the theatre and the hotel is ideally placed for a theatre break.Staff, rooms, food, pool all first class.  We are already talking about returning.",5,2019,01,15
206,superb,Can't fault this place. The service is excellent. The room was spacious and very comfortable. Really enjoyed the spa and the restaurant..The closeness to the Bord Gais Theatre is a plus.Even changing the bed linen to non allergic at short notice was done swiftly and professionally.,5,2019,01,15
206,Relaxation,"Absolutely brilliant time at this hotel.staff were very friendly and the food is beautiful!view from the room overlooking the canal and bord gais is stunning. Bed and pillows were the most comfortable ive ever slept on..loved the infinity pool and Jaquizzi. Would recommend to anyone.a massive thank you to Darragh and Leon for everything. 
Sharon",4,2019,01,15
206,Highly Recommend- on the Marker,"I stayed in the Presidential Suite for several days. Having always stayed in the middle of Temple Bar, or near the Train Station I thought it would be interesting to stay in this new part of Dublin and it was. Unfortunately we were not able to get tickets to the show at the Bord Gais (which is worth planning in advance as it is right in front of the hotel), but our concierge Jolanda did an excellent and caring job of helping me with somewhat last minute plans for the three boys who were traveling with me, including going outside in the cold to figure out how to rent the city bikes right across the street (which everyone really enjoyed). Her restaurant recommendations were spot on.

The views from our room were spectacular, the amenities great, the pool beautiful and the spa appears to be fantastic although unfortunately i had to cancel my spa appointment at the last minute (i definitely will go back and back to the spa).

A memorable time in Dublin and thank you to the Marker.",5,2019,01,13
206,Marker Above,"Visited hotel for a show nearby. Attentive staff. So welcoming, always pleasant. Food good and breakfast excellent. It would be a bit above what we would normally visit as it was for elderly in-laws Xmas present. They were bowled over by the whole experience, the rooms, the food etc but it was the staff who made the visit. Always on hand but never in your face. Would return",5,2019,01,12
206,Simply perfect,"Totally amazing!!!!Location - perfectThe Hotel - StunningThe staff - consistently super amazingThe food - greatSo cleanSo coolSo chilledSo accommodatingSo professional,yet warm,friendly,and casual too - wow what a perfect mix",5,2019,01,10
206,Would love to stay longer,"We stayed here overnight while attend a night time showing in the Bord Gais theatre
Parking can be difficult we are based in Carlow so we decided to treat ourselves with an overnight in a hotel
I will admit that I didn‚Äôt have high hopes but I was totally wrong 
They have a valet service that were very friendly no tipping required.  The receptionist was friendly and efficient and while offered assistance with our bags we decided to carry our own
Our room was lovely spacious and airy no bad smells.  The bathroom was large and to my delight had underfloor heating.  The heat in the room was the best - we have encountered so many hotel rooms where the heating is oppressive at best - this room was perfect and had a working thermostat which you‚Äôd be surprised at how rare that is.  The bed was so comfortable, there is a pillow menu and I suffer from asthma but had no problem with their soft down pillows.  The bed is the comfiest I‚Äôve experienced 
Also a lovely touch on our car being returned we were given complimentary bottles of water
Now the cons 
Breakfast is over at 10 personally I think this a little early and I heard quite a few customers complaining that breakfast had finished - I understand that it is a city based hotel but maybe at weekends breakfast could a bit later
The hotel itself was extremely warm while is was cool enough outside you need to start stripping layers while in the lobby
Also we would have liked to have a drink in the bar but by six o‚Äôclock every available table was occupied while I understand busy times I do think residents in the hotel should be able to reserve space of be given some kind of priority 
All said I would love to stay here again and try the food and the spa and also to stay a bit longer ",4,2019,01,10
206,Impressive Hotel with wonderful customer service!,"The hotel is situated in an upmarket, very well-maintained area of the Docklands, We were there primarily to see the wonderful 'Les Miserables' and we stayed for two nights in a superior room, just a short stroll across from the Theatre. 
Our bedroom was very large, modern and clean with a nice view and the bed, with quality bedding, was probably the most comfortable I have EVER slept in!!!!!  We found the room to be well sound-proofed and so quiet that, combined with such a comfy bed, made for an excellent night's sleep!
I also loved our gorgeous, very spacious bathroom, which had under-floor heating.
For the duration of our stay we found every single staff member to be pleasant and attentive, without being intrusive.
My only moan was just as I read from another recent review. There were fruit-flies on the fresh-fruit salad yesterday morning (Weds), so clearly nothing had been done to address the problem. Why on earth can the fruit not be displayed with see- through covers over the dishes? 
Also, the cooked breakfast (which had fairly limited choice for vegetarians incidentally) was barely warm.
Finally, I found the coffee extremely bitter, as if it had been maybe sitting for a long time?
This was the only area we found lacking- everything else about this hotel is wonderful, so please sort out your breakfast standard and become amazing!! Thank-you for looking after us so well.",4,2019,01,10
206,Theatre stay!!,This hotel is very comfortable but very pricey for the location !!! It‚Äôs very handy for the Bird G√°is theatre though and the valet parking is great!! There‚Äôs very little else in the area though but it‚Äôs a nice treat if going to the theatre!!,4,2019,01,09
206,"Great hotel, relaxing experience","I have stayed at the Marker multiple times and it never disappoints.  I always sleep well here, rooms are solid, quiet and beds are quite comfortable.  The lobby is nice, with a good bar/coffee area and the breakfast buffet is quite good.  The location is quite good if you are there on business with various companies, tech firms in the area and close walk to other areas of Dublin.",5,2019,01,09
206,The best hotel!,"Everything about this hotel exemplifies what a top class hotel should be. Every single member of staff are friendly, engaging and helpful. Rooms are fabulous, food is out of this world, and the gym, spa and pool are stunning. This is by far the best hotel we've ever stayed at!",5,2019,01,08
206,Wonderful relaxing break,"From the entrance with door staff and valet parking - to reception with Lavinia and her extreme attendance to us- to the beautiful room with a view to die for- to The Brasserie, absolutely mouthwatering meal from start to finish, served excellently by Mark and Collette (and colleague). Lunch the next day where Gary was so accommodating and food fab too. The entire experience was just so accomadating towards our overall stay in Dublin with car and luggage situation being catered for subsequent to our check out. Excellent service from start to finish . ",5,2019,01,08
206,"Great location, quiet at night.","The Marker is a lovely hotel.  The facilities in the room are great and much in keeping with the hotels star rating.  Only problem I had was with the breakfast.  There is alot to improve there.  There were fruit flies on the fruit, the potatoes at the hot section were luke warm, there were alot of supplements to pay for a decent hot breakfast.  The coffee wasn't great either that came with the breakfast.",4,2019,01,08
206,A wonderful Weekend venue,"I booked a stay as a Christmas gift for my wife along with tickets for a show in the Bord Gais and I can not be more thrilled to have done so. The location is second to none, as is the quality of the hotel itself. From the moment we entered to the moment we left the level of service was exemplary; friendly and efficient check in, warm and hospitable bar and dining staff and an even more friendly and efficient check out. A great lively bar and restaurant made for a great atmosphere post and pre show and the room for the night was very clean and inviting. I would recommend the Marker to anyone looking for a romantic weekend break in Dublin and especially to anyone taking in a show in the Bord Gais.",5,2019,01,08
206,Excellent hotel but a fair walk from city centre,"I stayed here for 2 nights recently and thought it was excellent. The room was a very generous size as was the bathroom. It looks as if all the bathrooms are wheelchair accessible without looking in any way ugly. It was extremely quiet, so very well insulated and the rooftop bar was a delight. The only downside is it's about a 15 minute brisk walk to the city centre but if you want to go to a play/musical, it is just across the road from the Bord Gais Theatre. ",5,2019,01,07
206,Pre Theatre drink,"Arrived early for Le Miserables at the Bord Gais Energy Theatre and decided to have a drink in The Marker. It‚Äôs a beautiful hotel, very modern and elegant with fabulous staff. The surroundings and seating are top quality five star. We have a very pleasant pre Theatre drink before heading over to see Le Miserables. It‚Äôs popular spot for a drink with folks going to a show.
Well worth a visit if you‚Äôre in the area.",4,2019,01,07
206,Comfortable Luxury,We stayed in the Marker on a Friday night and went to a show in the Bord Gais Theatre across the square from the hotel. The hotel is ideal for that purpose. The hotel is really very nice. We had a lovely room and breakfast. Great shower. Staff really friendly. Top marks.,5,2019,01,07
206,A luxury treat in Dublin ,"A fabulous hotel with brilliant customer service. 
The spa is really relaxing and well worth a visit. It was a shame that the rooftop bar was closed for the majority of our stay (4 nights) due to private parties.
The hallways are dark but at no point did I feel
Unsafe. 
The food in the bar was delicious. We didn‚Äôt have breakfast as it was ‚Ç¨28 per day and there is a lovely shop across the quay called ‚Äòfresh‚Äô who literally have fresh bread/ food for really reasonable prices. 
The cost is very high but worth it once in your lifetime üòä",4,2019,01,06
206,The Best Hotel ever,"From the moment we stopped the car in ""the set down area"" we were met by wonderful friendly helpful staff .   Hotel facilities out of this world .  Rooms super comfy bathrooms spacious bright .. finishing touches excellent .. petit fours to greet us in room ..names on tv screen with welcome message .... 
we slept so well never heard a sound around us like one always hears ..
Breakfast fantastic so healthy and plentiful. Staff so professional..all smiling faces chatty and so so helpful ...... sad to say no Irish working there",5,2019,01,06
206,Outstanding,"I was blown away by the staff, accommodations, and quality of the hotel. Its a bit far to walk to places on the other side of Dublin. The staff will help you with a taxi if desired. Bicycles are across the street to rent. Pool, bar, and rooftop are all worth your time. Quite, off to the side of Dublin in a safe place.",5,2019,01,05
206,An Excellent Hotel,"Before visiting the hotel I had read the reviews on Tripadvisor and didn't quite know exactly what to expect after some quite critical reviews. All I can say now is that those critics must not have been in the same hotel as I was.
The hotel well deserves its 5* rating. the building, rooms, restaurants and bar were very good and the staff from conceirge to reception to restaurant staff to bar staff, could not have been better. Its bar & restaurant charges were in line with similar costs in top Dublin hotels ( if not, in fact, a little cheaper) I would highly recommend it",5,2019,01,05
206,A lovely midweek break,"Stayed in January as we were going to see a musical in the Bord Gais. Could not get any closer to the venue, it‚Äôs an ideal base. The rooms were lovely with very comfortable beds and nice views. Underfloor heating in the bathroom, and a nespresso machine in the room were very nice additions! ",5,2019,01,05
206,Fantastic bedrooms and spa - a great place to relax,"The Marker is a beautiful hotel, situated about a 15/20 minute walk from the main sights in Dublin (although you'll need a taxi for Jameson and Guinness tours and they are easily available outside the hotel and are inexpensive). The highlights are most definitely the size and quality of the bedrooms and bathrooms. A real luxurious feel, yet contemporary with nice extras such as Nespresso and bathroom underfloor heating. The standard of housekeeping is outstanding, both in the room and the main areas of the hotel. The spa area is also lovely - it's not huge but was never crowded during our stay and the jacuzzi is amazing - it's really warm! We stayed over the New Year break and were lucky to get tickets for Les Miserables which was at the theatre next door, so I would recommend checking what's on at the Bord Gais Theatre before you travel to the Marker as they have lots of big shows and it's about a 30 second walk from the hotel. Seeing Les Mis really made our weekend. The reason I have given this hotel 4 stars (not 5) is partly based on my expectations for a 5 star hotel in terms of service (the staff are great but it did seem very busy in terms of being able to order drinks and also wait times for items ordered off the breakfast menu) and also I felt that the New Year's Eve activities could have had more impact. The main event was on the rooftop bar (which is gorgeous) but it was too packed and too cold to really enter into the party spirit. The main lobby bar had a DJ and there was an opportunity to have had more of an atmosphere here as it's a really nice space but of course everyone wanted to be on the rooftop at midnight! But these are very small issues - above all it's a great hotel in a great location if you like being a bit out of the main hustle and bustle with a really nice river walk each day and I thought the price, given the high quality of the accommodation and standard  of the spa facilities was excellent. We had a very relaxing time at The Marker (alongside some great Guinness!). ",4,2019,01,05
206,The Rooftop on a Hot Summer's Day (in 2018) was the place to be. NB* Must remember to visit again.,"On more than one occasion I frequented the rooftop of the Marker hotel for a little finger food and some cold bevages, both of which they do very well. 

Of course these were work related or business events and the service was excellent. 

Even attend again in late September or early October when the summer heat was gone and the service was equally good.

The views are rather amazing both during the day and at night.

The selection of finger food was very good indeed, seem to recall black pudding sausage rolls!
Also served sliders,  fish & chips and a curry.

Well worth a visit if you get an opportunity. ",5,2019,01,04
206,Fab hotel but the staff really make it extra special ,"Stayed here in early jan for a catch up with college friends! It was just fantastic from start to finish! The staff were without a doubt the best service staff I‚Äôve encountered in a long time. They were incredibly helpful, friendly and excellent at their jobs. The room was lovely very comfy bed and fab bathroom.... I just loved every minute. My one negative was that the rooftop bar wasn‚Äôt open as it only opens fri / sat in jan/ feb. When booking a selling point of theirs is the rooftop bar and there was no mention that this wasn‚Äôt going to be open. It was actually the readier originally went with hotel! Having said that I loved the whole experience! Will def be back! ",5,2019,01,04
206,First-Rate Hotel,"This review is long overdue. My husband and I stayed at The Marker during our honeymoon in Oct 2018.

Some of the highlights were:
1. The Staff. Incredibly friendly and helpful. They made our trip special with all their finishing touches (e.g., chocolates, faux rose petals, champagne, etc).
2. The Amenities. Infinity pool, jacuzzi, sauna, and eucalyptus steam room. Need I say more!
3. Accommodations. We had a corner suite with a great view. Everything was modern and clean. Loved the bathroom tub and shower.
4. Breakfast. We had breakfast included in our package. Large selection of eggs, bacon, sausage, pastries, juices, yoghurt, fruit, etc. We love starting the day with a big breakfast!
5. Restaurant. Had a delicious dinner at the hotel restaurant. I really wish we could have tried the rooftop bar, but it was closed during our stay.

This was by far the best hotel experience I've had thus far and I constantly rave about it when I discuss it with friends and family. If you're considering staying at The Marker, do yourself a favour and do it! I definitely plan to visit Dublin again in the future and will make it a point to stay here.",5,2019,01,03
206,NYE,"The staff were very lovely, shout-out especially to the  receptionist, Daniel, Sandra and Kevin and the manager Charlie. They were very good to us. The room was very lovely and comfortable. The view was very nice. We had a great New Years Experience while staying at The Marker and we hope to return. ",5,2019,01,03
206,Christmas Treat,"My husband and I have stayed here for the past four years. It is still a pleasure. Staff are all very politeand have a excellent work ethic. Breakfast is plentiful, sets you up for a day of exploring.The make wonderful Side Car Cocktails. ",5,2019,01,03
206,Excellent Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Marker over the New Year and its an excellent hotel and I would highly recommend it. The staff at the Marker really are at the top of their game and nothing was too much trouble. The hotel is beautifully designed, modern and bright and set in a great location. Its far enough away from the madness of the centre, set in the docklands in a nicely developed Quay around 20 mins walk from Temple Bar. The hotel also hires out bikes if you fancy a ride around the area!
The bedrooms were large, very clean and really comfortable (best pillows ever & great products in the bathroom). The spa was also good with large infinity pool, treatments, sauna etc and comfy loungers to relax after a dip.
Darragh from Guest Relations is a credit to the team - he managed to secure us some great dinner reservations at a very busy time of year! 
We attended the NYE party for guests on the Roof Top bar and it was buzzing with a great DJ and some very glam guests!  An excellent hotel all round.",5,2019,01,03
206,overall great experience,"If I come back to Dublin I would stay again. Very friendly check in. Great rooms with big bath room and very big shower. Good walls, so you wouldn`t here the other rooms. Special, modern atmosphere. Thank you",5,2019,01,03
206,Amazing dinner!,"We visited the Marker for dinner before attending a show in the theatre across the square.  This was our second visit to this wonderful hotel.  We had booked a table, and had a drink in the bar first.  The service was good.  I have given my review a 5 star rating, it would have been less, (due to a staff member in the restaurant) but a Manager redeemed the situation.  We had been seated at a table right under the air conditioning. (I was suffering from an ear infection)  I asked if we could move, the waiter told us we had to pick between a table beside a serving station or near the door (he added, ""you won't like that one either""), even though the Restaurant was practically empty and I am not sure why we couldn't sit at one of the other tables.  I didn't expect that in a 5 star, I think he may have forgot where he worked & thought he was seating us in a fast food joint,  Thankfully, after standing, wondering what to do, and a bit annoyed with the waiter's attitude, a Manager came over and brought us to a table.  He was polite, professional and a credit to the Hotel, I didn't catch his name.  After that, the service from all the other staff members, food & atmosphere was wonderful.  I would recommend the restaurant in the Marker,",5,2019,01,02
206,Great Hotel,Great Staff and great service from the minute you arrive to the minute you leave.The Valet parking is excellent and all the staff are cheerful and helpful.The rooftop bar is well worth a visit with fantastic views over the city.,5,2019,01,02
206,Sean McCaffrey,overall experience was very goodlocation good bus and taxis all close byif going to the theatre could not be any handieras it is just seconds away from hotel doorhotel its self is very spacious and spotlessand all staff are doth friendly and helpful.had a nice pleasant stay,4,2019,01,02
206,Finally a hotel with a healthy room service menu!! Also housekeeping is A+,"The hotel is nice. The room was spacious. Bathroom was all marble, very spacious bath tub and nice shower. The room service menu was impressive in that it catered for healthy conscious eaters, with gluten free and dairy free options. I really enjoyed the food!! The housekeeping was superb, very impressed with the cleaning of the rooms, it was spotless each time. The spa area was also lovely. Nicely located in the business side of Dublin with a 15 minute walk to the centre. 

Negatives: 

1. room didn't have windows which could open, the air got stuffy and the air con was not particularly effective.
2. there was a charge of 5 euros labelled as 'tray charge' which accompanied every room service charge 9when i got the bill) when food was delivered which i thought was odd.
3. the lighting in the room was dull and not bright enough.

All in all a nice hotel.",4,2019,01,01
206,Honeymoon at the Marker,"Excellent service and accommodation. The Marker really delivered for us! Couldn't fault the room, the spa or the restaurant. So many little touches that made our stay feel special. We shall be staying again.",5,2018,12,31
206,Great bar for pre theatre drinks,"Loved the bar here for pre-theatre drinks. Great, friendly service. Lovely big pot of tea for two for my mother and her friend. I had a nice gin and tonic and when i asked for an alcohol free cocktail for my teenage daughter, the barman said he would make something special. And he did!
Good atmosphere too. ",5,2018,12,30
206,Weekend Getaway in Dublin,"Away from the hustle and bustle but still a quick walk on the the River Liffey to central Dublin.  Lovely. modern hotel off Grand Canal Square.  Great location if seeing a show at Bois Gard.  Stayed over St. Patrick's Day weekend, the hotel was sold out but you wouldn't know.  The hotel staff was very accommodating and friendly.  Rooms are a good size for European standards and very comfortable, the bathroom was on the smaller side but love the heated floors and towel rack.  Wish they choose a brighter color though for the tiles--never been a fan of dark tiles in a bathroom.  Breakfast selection was good and very tasty.  Ill be back.",5,2018,12,29
206,Gem of a hotel in Dublin ,"Beautiful, modern and luxurious hotel with a real 5* feel. Location ideal. Worth every penny. You will not be disappointed staying here if you enjoy luxury. 
The bar menu is fantastic, cocktails are to die for and the root tip bar is amazing in summer! 
Also has a pretty great spa! ",5,2018,12,29
206,Enjoyable stay,Everything was great. Aall of the staff were very firindly and profesiional in their work. Spa was excellent.  Location was great for us as we were going to a show in the Bord Gais Energy Theatre and the hotel is just across the street from the theatre,5,2018,12,27
206,Horrendous,"Booked this hotel as a special treat for my husbands birthday. We have never been so disappointed and have no idea how this hotel received a 5* rating! The hotel was dark and dingy, we had to use our mobile telephone torches to walk the corridors to the equally dark and dingy room with no mirror and awful facilities. Breakfast was inadequate with many items showing on the menu unavailable. Couldn‚Äôt make a restaurant reservation and after begging we dined in the bar with a gale force wind blowing through. Food was cold as were the plates. We have stayed in many leading 5* hotels, this hotel does not deserve this rating. Terrible experience.",1,2018,12,25
206,Terrific experience,"This review is way overdue, but the wife and I had an excellent stay here. Breakfast was included for us and is of amazingly high quality (fwiw we tried a Full Irish at 2 other places out in the country and this was definitely the best). Staff was very courteous. Highly recommended!",5,2018,12,24
206,Wonderful hotel and staff,"A very stylish hotel with great food, bars, pool and spa.  The rooms were a good size.  Bathroom was lovely too.  Very nice shampoos and body wash. I will definitely be returning on future visits.  5 star hotel without the stuffiness. ",5,2018,12,20
206,Nice Treat,Stayed here in conjunction with a visit to the Bord Gais theatre.   Very nice....fairly expensive.   You also have to add on the cost of car parking.  But thoroughly enjoyable.  Will definitely consider a return visit.,5,2018,12,19
206,Great place to stay,"Beautiful room, much space, good WiFi, cleaned every day and new towels and soap. Great bed and view over the docklands. Gym had good equipment. Very nice employees who Will help and advise when necessary. Nice walk to town (20minutes). ",5,2018,12,18
206,Superb,Stayed here for one night for a show in the Bord G√°is Energy Theatre. The hotel was fabulous. The staff were so lovely and really helpful. The food was fantastic both in the bar and the restaurant. The breakfast was a feast.,5,2018,12,17
206,The Marker Hotel consistently wins my vote in Dublin,"I have stayed at this hotel and each time have been highly satisfied.  Great service and lovely modern venue.  It's an easy walk to the IFSC, so suits my need when traveling there on business.  When the weather is warmer (summer), the rooftop bar is lovely!",5,2018,12,17
206,Wonderful Experience,Great facility and staff. I was in town for a 2 day meeting and this hotel was recommended to me by an associate. Looking forward to returning as the level of service in all areas was impeccable.If only they could fix the weather.......,5,2018,12,17
206,Superlative experience ,"I spent one amazing night before Christmas and the hotel - modern and located in the business heart of the city - offers a luxury spot. I really enjoyed the joga class which is something unique in the city.
On top of that special mention for Mo the best concierge ever who suggested me lovely place to eat  while he was bringing luggage to our room.he is amazing one of the best concierge ever! ",5,2018,12,16
206,Super expensive not much included,"I stayed here to attend my companies Christmas party.  

The cost of the room was excessive and was disappointed to find that breakfast wasn't included and also an extra ‚Ç¨24 per night to park your car. 

I think it's insane to pay nearly ‚Ç¨300 for a room for one night with no breakfast included and no parking included.

My room was nice but not fantastic, I've stayed in much nicer hotels and paid a lot less. You're basically paying for the location and it is a good location.

I found the hallways and the room itself very dark, as I was attempting to get ready for my Christmas party it was a bit off putting to be trying to get ready in dim lighting.

Don't get me wrong, the hotel is nice, I had a great night sleep I just thought it was extremely over priced.  Like the staff offer to help you a lot in unnecessary ways ha I would of gladly done without the help to pay less.

The Christmas party itself I thought was a disaster!

The dinner was delayed for some weird reason and we were all plied with wine (not really complaining about that) however when we finally did get our meal everyone was completely inebriated (I wasn't drinking much I only had one glass of wine) we were still eating dinner after 22:00.

I found the meal to be weird art deco dinner after waiting for hours for food....I'm handed a big ball of mozzarella and tomatoes?? what is that? Maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough for this venue. The meal wasn't great then served freezing cold coffee at the end.

Then after all of that, I found the security staff quite rude and it's not because I was drunk I found them genuinely rude the agreement was the bar should have been open until 1:30am but the lights went on at about 1:15am and the ushering out began.  

It was quite frustrating that some of my drunk colleagues were being pushed around even though all the delays contributed to the whole situation. I'm not excusing their behaviour but they weren't entirely to blame. 

I don't mean to be so negative here, I'm aware that I chose to pay the money to stay here. The staff in general were very polite and helpful and everything was lovely and clean with nice plush carpets and a nice bathroom.

Overall, I did like this hotel but probably wouldn't stay here again. I guess it's a bit too rich for my blood. 

So what I've said is sort of provoked by how hard I would need to work to afford to stay here.  I think most of the people who stay in this hotel are very well off.",3,2018,12,15
206,Best Hotel in Dublin,"Have stayed a few times at this property as well as most of the hotels in Dublin. The Marker is the best in my opinion. It‚Äôs in the centre of Dublin but yet easily and quickly accessible from the airport through the tunnel. Located in the newly developed area around Grand Canal quay and right next door to the Bord Gais theatre and Aviva stadium it is easy to see instantly how well placed it is. However the two key elements that single The Marker out from the rest is the staff and the rooms. It‚Äôs impossible in my opinion to find better, friendlier and more capable staff than the guys at this hotel. The level of service is exemplary. The rooms, standard rooms, are the largest I‚Äôve been in. Loads of space, modern and the bathrooms are amazing. Heated flooring too. In other properties these would be sold as suites! Really looking forward to an opportunity to go back, specially in summer to enjoy the offerings at the rooftop bar",5,2018,12,15
206,Stunning views and superb food!,"Highly recommend this hotel. Staff are wonderful, food is sensational and the views are incredible. Only stayed one night but we were treated like royalty! Bathroom was like something from a movie and the bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever come across!",5,2018,12,13
206,"Loved it, loved it, loved it!","We stayed here for 3 night upon arriving in Ireland as part of a tour and we were greeted quickly and warmly by the staff. The room was great, comfortable with nice contemporary furnishings and comfortable beds and towels etc.
The restaurant was very nice, a full breakfast with too much to choose from, and all well prepared and fresh.
We returned at the end of the tour for our last night before departure and we were treated exactly the same way, all the staff were great and very helpful and friendly.
We would stay here again.",5,2018,12,11
206,Quality accomodation,"Great hotel in a great location just outside the hustle and bustle , an up and coming location. Service from all the staff was first class, great variety of choice for breakfast using quality produce.",5,2018,12,11
206,A perfect weekend,"We had a lovely weekend in the Marker Hotel. From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel welcome.  Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. We had a lovely room for three adults.  The facilities are excellent.  This is an ideal location for sight-seeing and theatre trips",5,2018,12,11
206,"Young Love, n Mature Heads...","There are time in your life that just any hotel won‚Äôt cut it and, for me, Romance is one of them.To enjoy a Special Moment in time, with my Beautiful Lady, my choice of Hotel was critical.I required styles, location, luxury rooms, and a ‚ÄúSpecial‚Äù touch to make it all come togetherThe Marker delivered on all that and more.Who ever said their Romance was dead hasn't stay a night in The Marker with the person they Love.We‚Äôll be plan to be back, many times, in the not to distance future.",5,2018,12,10
206,One night not enough - loved this hotel...,Stayed one night as attending Les Mis in Bord Gais Theatre across the road.  Could not find fault with this luxurious hotel.  Room -  very good design - adequate size with large comfortable bathroom. Extremely comfortable large bed and bedding.  Staff are exceptional - special mention to Jolanda and Dundalk Security staff member at roof top bar.. Extremely helpful and friendly.  Brasserie was booked out with private party and the Hotel Restaurant was booked out so did not sample dinner.  Breakfast was top class.  We loved everything about this hotel.  Unfortunately our stay was too short - would highly recommended - we will return..,5,2018,12,10
206,Absolutely fantastic,"Stayed here for two nights for my partner‚Äôs birthday, and from the moment we arrived we knew we were somewhere special.

The hotel is immaculate, modern, and the staff go out of their way to assist you in any way they can. 

Our double room was excellent - a good size, well equipped and had a large bathroom with bath and separate shower.

The pool and spa area is also one of the nicest I‚Äôve seen in any hotel.

Breakfast was also fantastic.

One of the best hotels we have ever stayed at anywhere in the world.",5,2018,12,10
206,Great Location - Professional Stuff,Location of the hotel is excellend for business travelers. Very close to many major tech company offices. Easy to access from airport.Like 20 min by taxi. Rooms are big and clean. Stuff are very kind and professional.,4,2018,12,09
206,Nice and quiet modern hotel,"Just as the title says, this is a nice and quiet modern hotel in a great location. For those on business it's right across the bridge from the Dublin Convention Centre and for anyone doing business with Facebook it's just next door to their HQ. A short walk of 20 minutes would bring you to the nice downtown attractions. Buses and taxis are plentiful but for that short distance and depending on the traffic it would for sure be faster to walk. Getting in and back to the airport is a breeze with the Airlink Express with the stations on the other side of the bridge.
Due to the short nature of the visit we did not utilize any of the full amenities offered by the hotel so we cannot really review them. Our room was nicely furnished with large bed and firm comfortable mattress. The bathroom was very nice and the heated floor was a welcome treat coming in from the rain outside.

We did ask for a room with a view of the canal and we got such a room but really there was not much to see in that direction.
Finally I'm glad more hotels are now giving us mixed outlet to charge UK, US, EU devices as well as straight out USB.

Would definitely stay here again and if we get to use the gym swimming pool and the restaurants we will update our review.

Oh and Dublin and Ireland in general is amazing with will wonderful friendly people just as the staff of the hotel were. Definitely worth a visit",4,2018,12,09
206,nice simple and elegant,"I found the Marker to be nice and simple with discreet and efficient service and with elegant and spacious spaces be they collective or in private, both bedroom and bathroom. Original and good products in the bathroom too !",5,2018,12,07
206,great hotel and fantastic staff,Really great hotel in a central location in Dublin. Staff are fantastic and food is very good. Great breakfast and rooms are nice and the carpets are rich and luxurious. I really like this hotel and a very central location ,5,2018,12,06
206,Great location and service,"We stayed at the Marker for our 5 year anniversary and could not have had a better time. The staff was great and very helpful with any questions we had about the city, restaurants, etc.  I would highly recommend The Marker for anyone looking for a stay in Dublin.",5,2018,12,06
206,A fantastic weekend break.,Everything about the hotel was great and the staff were truly excellent.They were very helpful and probably the most friendly we have ever come across in the many hotels we have stayed in. The food in the bistro was very good.Would reccomend the tomahawk steak on the rib for two. ,5,2018,12,05
206,A new favourite in Dublin,"I've stayed in many excellent hotels and the Marker is definitely among them, with one edge: the Marker's staff. Friendly, knowledgable, charming and international, they turned a good trip into a great one! ",5,2018,12,05
206,A luxurious home from home,"A wonderful hotel which combines excellent facilities, beautiful decor along with very friendly staff and a relaxed atmosphere.  This hotel will definitely be top of my list for any future visits to Dublin.",5,2018,11,27
206,Simply the best ,"I cannot say enough good things about this hotel - it is simply outstanding. We arrived early and asked to drop our luggage in- we were found a room that was available and given the key at 10am. The room was beautiful - large and very comfortable bed, a very luxurious bathroom and not a sound heard throughout our stay.  We used the spa facilities which again were fantastic. On Friday night we visited the rooftop bar. It was busy early on due to a function but we could sit outside ... in November. However this was the highlight. Very effective heaters, lovely warm blankets and very attentive service all made for a great experience overlooking Dublin sipping wine and enjoying the lovely vibe that is felt everywhere in this hotel. Thank you to Raymond the lovely chap we spoke to on the rooftop bar for his service and offers of help. The sense of pride in being part of this hotel was evident in every single member of staff - thank you! A memorable stay we will recommend to others and return to ourselves. ",5,2018,11,26
206,Modern hotel close to convention center,"We stayed here for a convention at the CCD. The hotel is just across the river, 10 minutes walk. Next door to Facebook HQ. The area is still being built up but has several restaurants, coffee shops, and a grocery store within walking distance. Walk to downtown or Temple Bar area was 20-30 minutes.

The lobby is always busy in a good way. The food was pretty good, a slight upgrade on traditional bar menus.

The staff was friendly and helpful but not overly intrusive.

The room was clean and spacious with no lingering carpet odors found in many older hotels. Has safe and honesty bar with room to store a few water bottles of your own if needed. 

Bathroom was big enough with stand up rainforest shower and separate tub. Heated floor and night lights were a nice touch. Not enough light in our opinion.

Desk has US, UK, and EU plugs. TV has ability to stream content from your device if you download an app (didn‚Äôt try)

Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2018,11,22
206,Great Hotel,"I recently stayed here while on a very brief business trip. I arrived very late and left very early but the whole experience was great. The doorman came to help me with my bags before i'd even got out the taxi, check-in took under 3 mins and my room was beautifully clean and tidy. Breakfast was hot (key!) and there was a good selection. Everyone i came across had a big smile on their face. My only regret was that i didn't have time to use the spa! I'll be back again in the future.",5,2018,11,20
206,Amazing.Amazing.Amazing!!,"Wow.Just back from this fantastic hotel in Dublin.We had 2 nights there and apart from a little problem with a lunch booking,Which was sorted pretty quickly,I have to say having stayed at many worldwide hotels The Marker ranks right up at the top.Attention to detail was awesome, the staff , no matter what their role,were so welcoming and friendly,great food and an overall wonderful experience .Would really love to visit again in the future.",5,2018,11,19
206,Wonderful Hotel,The Marker is beautiful and within walking distance to everything.  The staff are very friendly and helpful. My room was comfortable and very relaxing.  I would absolutely recommend staying here on your next trip. ,5,2018,11,19
206,Brilliant hotel with amazing staff,We had a lovely stay at the Marker. We were staying for a concert so didn‚Äôt get a lot of use of the hotel which is a shame when the price is quite high for a 1 night stay. The roof top bar is lovely and the staff really make your stay. They are so friendly and accommodating. ,5,2018,11,19
206,Excellent hotel,"I have been lucky enough to stay at this hotel on 4 different occasions  
This weekend I went with my wife and we could not of asked for any better service. 
On arrival we had been allocated a corner suite wow ! And also when  we got to the room a lovely plate of fruit with welcome back to the marker written in chocolate on the plate. Lovely touch. 
Check in fast as they have 4 people checking in. 

Bar service excellent lots of staff and they remember your drinks after first round. 

Will definitely be back as this is the best customer service we have found in Dublin. 

Huge bonus this weekend üòÄ
When we were using the pool and spa facilities on the Friday afternoon the All Blacks just wandered in to the pool and sauna and they were the most polite guys you could ever hope to meet, they just chatting away to myself and my wife ( when she could stop smiling ) 

Great weekend 
Well done the marker",5,2018,11,18
206,Impeccable service!,"Quite impressed with this hotel. Facilities are excellent, including very nice rooms (received an upgrade to a corner deluxe room) with comfortable beds, radiant floor heating in the bathrooms and excellent shower with a high water pressure. What impressed me the most is the service. Every staff member showed some remarkable personal attention. I arrived very early in AM after a red eye from USA and in most of the smaller hotels, this would end up with some empty promises that they would get the room ready as soon as possible...probably around 2p. But not here, they were almost apologetic that they did not have the room available, got me a free breakfast and promised to call me as soon as the room is clean, but no later than in 2 hours. 2 hours passed and the room was ready with my luggage already taken there and everything neatly arranged. And if you ask the receptionist anything they are not just helpful, they personally take you to wherever you need to be - for example show you the business center or personally arranging the cab and making sure that they accept credit cards if you do not have cash (most cabs in Dublin are cash only). Pool, restaurants, general atmosphere, location in the close proximity to the convention center, all of this is a nice bonus. ",5,2018,11,17
206,PURE ELEGANCE in Dublin!!!,"I stayed here for 3 nights while visiting Dublin and I was extremely impressed. From the moment we walked in (doorman present at all hours) we we're greeted with great hospitality and treated like royalty. Service is superb!!! The hotel is absolutely beautiful, checking out the rooftop bar is a must, spectacular views of Dublin! I thoroughly enjoyed our room, very luxurious, and also had great city views!",5,2018,11,17
206,Will definitely go back!,"I stayed here on a business trip and every aspect of my stay was faultless.  I received a 1st class service all round.  I certainly plan to go back in the near future for a leisure trip. Would highly recommend you visit, you won't be disappointed.",5,2018,11,15
206,Great place to stay in Dublin,Just very good.  Hotel and facilities were clean and tidy.  Staff polite and knowledgeable.  Trip Advisor requires me to write 200 words so now I am just wasting words because I have nothing more to say - it was good - OK ,5,2018,11,14
206,Mid week stay,Brilliant hotel would highly recommend a stay in the Marker. Staff were brilliant very warm and helpful. The hotel was fantastic food was brilliant and rooms were spacious and comfortable. The location is perfect ,5,2018,11,14
206,AMAZING,"This was probably the best hotel experience I've ever had! We had such a warm welcome, the staff could not help you enough, very clean rooms, delicious breakfast and a lovely wellness and spa area. Absolutely perfect!",5,2018,11,13
206,Fantastic Spa Hotel,"The Marker is known in Dublin for its buzzy rooftop bar, but it's well worth a visit to use the beautiful spa  with its infinity pool. I like a hotel with a proper gym, and this one delivered. Lovely breakfast too!",5,2018,11,13
206,Staying at the Marker,"Nice hotel to base yourself in Dublin if on Business, rooms are very clean and the Bar very vibrant due to the theatre situated across the road.  Would recommend, it is not cheap but I always stay here when on business.",4,2018,11,13
206,U2 weekender,"Stayed at The Marker as we wanted a top hotel for our stay to catch U2 at their final Dublin show at the 3Arena - a short walk away. 
Hotel service was excellent. Rooms comfortable. 
Breakfast fab. 
We wish we could have made use of all the facilities; we‚Äôll just have to return.",5,2018,11,12
206,Perfect,"My husband booked this hotel as a treat after a long October. In the vibrant dock area of Dublin. Think this is the up and coming area of Dublin. Hotel was just beautiful. Everything and more. Staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for you. Weather on the day we arrived was awful, so spent the afternoon in the hotel. We had a beautiful lunch in the bar area and we were treated so well, staff really couldn‚Äôt do enough for you. Hotel room was modern, finished to a high standard. Coffee machine, was a lovely touch. Bottled water. Bathroom with a bath and a shower. Bed was super comfy and a/c to boot. We checked out on the Sunday and were able to leave our bags with reception and they booked a taxi for us to the airport. Could not recommend this hotel enough. Really do go the extra mile.",5,2018,11,12
206,Perfect hotel for a short stay,"Excellent room with fabulously comfortable bed. Perfect location- short walk to city centre and easy to get to the 3arena. Spa facilities, pool and gym are a rare treat in a Dublin hotel. Lovely staff, clean, comfortable and will definitely be back.",5,2018,11,11
206,"A great hotel, fun area","Dublin has a big selection of places to stay; the Marker is in the tech area. It's just enough off the beaten path to give you a respite from the city action, but its easy walking distance to many good sights throughout Dublin. The hotel is very international so it's a great place to first arrive to when visiting Dublin from the States. Very clean, sleek hotel. Our room was big and super comfortable. We were thrilled with our stay. ",5,2018,11,08
206,One night stay,"Stayed at hotel for one night as attending gig in 3 arena.Location was ideal with only a short walk to venue.
Have stayed here on a few occasions and have never been disappointed.Cannot fault the hotel as they consistently meet the high standards they have set.
Staff very courteous,professional,and knowledgeable. Did not have dinner in hotel on this occasion but did have breakfast which was cooked perfectly.
Unfortunately I did not get to use any of the leisure facilities due to lack of time.
Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel,the operation of which is like a well oiled machine.",5,2018,11,08
206,a very enjoyable 48 hour stay,a wonderful experience in a top hotel. All staff were friendly and very courteous and efficient. The room was on the top floor with wonderful view. The cleanliness of room and toiletries are top quality and so are the catering facilities. It is a joy to stay at this hotel,5,2018,11,08
206,Memorable one night stay to mark 65th Birthday,"Exceptional attention to detail combined with friendly and attentive staff - very fine dining and a great and always improving location make The Marker spot on for a short break. As on  two previous occasions my wife and I took the train from Belfast to Connelly station. On a dry day the best connection is a half hour walk crossing the new bridge over the  Liffey to The Marker. We arranged an early Saturday check in then, apart from a stroll around the canal, spent the rest of our time in the hotel before returning to Belfast on Sunday afternoon. The swimming  pool, SPA and a very cosy bed filled our time. The Saturday lunch and Sunday breakfast were up to the usual Marker high standards. The Saturday night meal was exceptional. I have yet to master the method of including photos, but at the risk of boring readers with too much detail  the menu for two persons sharing euro 120!  was "" Beef & Bordeaux""  Starter Flamed Salmon - rollmops,Chamomile Jelly, smoked shiitake,and Rye Crumble. Next a small sorbet. Main -"" John Stone"" Tomahawk Rib Eye steak with Forest Mushrooms, shallots and Marrow Jus. Dessert - Pastachio & White Chocolate Cake with Baileys Foam and Coffee Ice Cream. All accompanied with a bottle of excellent Chateau Langrange, St Julien , Bordeaux. 2013. Never had a Tomahawk Rib Eye before cooked to order med rare. Stunning One stop hotel for a great condensed experience.",5,2018,11,07
206,Amazing experience!,"This hotel is a treat to stay in! If you're looking for outstanding service and beautiful rooms, then this is the place. We were only staying for 1 night so unfortunately we ran out of time to use the Spa and Wellness centre but it's an excuse to go back. We will absolutely be booking again.",5,2018,11,07
206,Great contemporary hotel.,"Good large room with views of the river, long pool and well equipped gym...right in the heart of town, quick walk to just about all. Easy nice breakfast selection and very friendly attentive staff ...i'd go back for sure.",5,2018,11,07
206,"Very pleasant, room for improvements","Stayed just the one night. Turned up in our car, the staff were very professional and pleasant, they took my car from us at the front and parked it up for the night, check in was again very professional. We had a delux room on the 5th floor. 
The room was a good size with on-suite bathroom. The bathroom had a slight damp smell, also the shower nor the bath had a hose, it was all fixed head and simple tap in the bath. It was obvious from the shower that they could have done with a hose as the shower floor was stained where they hadn‚Äôt kept on top of the cleaning. I also find it hard to shower properly without a hose. 
The bar and food area all worked, we had the chicken curry which was delicious. The bar/table service could have been a bit more attentive later on. 
In the morning we had a very early departure as we had a ferry to catch. The breakfast opens at 6.30am however the manager accommodated us slightly earlier which we greatly appreciated. The breakfast was fresh and a good selection. 
It wasn‚Äôt a cheap stay at around ¬£500 for the room, however apart from the bathroom facilities and smell it all worked very well. Would definitely go back. ",4,2018,11,06
206,Roof Top Bar is a must..Gem !,"We had a lovely stay at The Marker Food was nice but the highlight was the Roof Top Bar and the views of the city.

Our room was beautiful with grand door scaling from roof to floor and a beautiful bathroom with huge bath and separate glass shower",5,2018,11,05
206,Exceptional Hotel,Hotel was perfectly located for the concert we attended in the 3 arenaThe food in all areas was exceptional especially thebrasserie Our room was fabulous with great amenitiesAll the staff we encountered were so friendly to our children,5,2018,11,04
206,Swanky and swish but expensive,"The Marker Hotel is a fine hotel which is located right beside the Bord G√°is theatre in a very up and coming trendy area of Dublin City. It boasts a rooftop bar with amazing 360 degree views of Dublin but beware it only opens Thursday-Sunday during the winter months which was a major disappointment to me as it was not clearly highlighted at the time of booking through the hotel website. Didn't get my rooftop cocktail  I had food and drinks in The Marker Bar and while the food was adequate it didn't set the world on fire either. To be honest the bar area is right in the foyer and is a bit soulless. The rooms are lovely and the views of the Bord Gais theatre and surrounding area are impressive. The staff are generally very efficient and polite without being over friendly.  I arrived by car and had to pay for parking in the hotel parking area which did not sit well with me. The swimming pool area was pleasant and sauna and steam rooms also. However, the general lighting in the hotel was very poor. The lights were very dim or low and it was difficult to see where you were going at times in the corridors. Overall a very good hotel but very expensive and just something missing in terms of soul . ",4,2018,11,03
206,Brilliant Service,"The service of the reception was indeed responsive and efficient,brilliant food,
And especially the amenities were nice. I enjoyed my stay here, the location relatively close to other recreational areas which makes it convenient to use with Uber. Would recommend!",5,2018,11,03
206,Amazing ,Started our trip here jet lagged and tired. Bed was so comfortable and everything was perfect. The pool and hot tub may have been the best part so don‚Äôt miss it. Rooftop bar was fun however would of been better in summer a little cold in November but they did have blankets out for is to use which was such an amazing little touch. ,5,2018,11,01
206,"Location, location","Ideal hotel for some pampering and treating yourself to a fine hotel. Food is excellent with good choices, service with a bit of chat,. friendly staff. Easily accessible by car or dart it's a great base to get out in Dublin",5,2018,10,31
206,Perfect,My husband and I stayed in this outstanding hotel for one night for our anniversary.  We enjoyed a perfect experience from start to finish.  The staff treated us like royalty and their attention to detail was exceptional.  I would highly recommend a stay in the Marker.,5,2018,10,30
206,"A gem of a hotel in a beautiful location, can recommend this hotel enough.",It has been a long time since my wife and I have been blown away by an Irish hotel. The helpfulness and attention from the staff were second to none. Excellent restaurant and bar. The cleanliness of the room and facilities was amazing. We can‚Äôt recommend this hotel enough.,5,2018,10,30
206,Overall a very good hotel,"Beautiful hotel, water views, staff is impeccable- above and beyond every interaction, rooms are clean and modern. My only gripe is the lighting in the rooms. I know dim is the trend but for business travelers, particularly those wishing to wear make up, this is a challenge. A separate mirror is provided in the room and I just took this over to the window to make sure my make up was on ok- it is serious mood lighting! ",4,2018,10,30
206,Beautiful contemporary hotel,"Stayed here this weekend.  Fabulous luxurious hotel with amazing attentive staff.  On checking in we were rushing to a concert in the 3 Arena.  The receptionist told me to leave my case with her and she would have it placed in our room.  On returning as stated case was in room.  Rooms are large, relaxing and silent - not a sound to be heard.  Breakfast was perfect with all you could wish for.  The pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna are all very tranquil.  Staff in restaurant and in spa attend to your every request.  Very impressed",5,2018,10,30
206,Outstanding,"Just returned home from a weekend at the marker. What a fantastic hotel. Check in staff were great, very friendly and professional. Our room Was on the 4th floor and was bright and airy. Floor to ceiling windows are fabulous. The bathroom was beautiful with underfloor heating and little lights along the bottom of the bath for night time. The toiletries were beautiful. We visited the pool three times... Each time it was very quiet and relaxing. The pool is beautiful and the hot tub just gorgeous.
We visited the roof top bar twice and each time had fantastic service and gorgeous drinks, along with lovely, complimentary nibbles. 
 I loved the fact you could order different types of pillows.... I asked for a memory foam pillow and it arrived in about 5 minutes. The complimentary nespresso machine and papers delivered to the room was lovely. 
We absolutely loved our stay at the Marker. We would love to go back some day. I actually don't think I would stay anywhere else in Dublin now!",5,2018,10,29
206,Flawless,"We had a one night stay here at the end of October and couldn‚Äôt be more impressed.
From check in to check out every member of staff we came in to contact with was pleasant and more than happy to help if needs be.
We arrived slightly early so our room wasn‚Äôt fully ready however, the receptionist Discel was very pleasant and helpful and then Silvie came to greet us and offered us a coffee. Out of all the hotels I‚Äôve stayed in I‚Äôve never seen anyone at Management level as good at their job as Silvie. Sne honestly went ‚Äúabove and beyond‚Äù in every sense of the phrase, it was a pleasure to deal with her and thanks again Silvie for your generous hospitality.
That‚Äôs the sort of service you expect in a leading 5 star hotel and Silvie certainly lived up to that.

The whole property is absolutely spotless, beautifully designed and smells fresh in every area. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a Deluxe King room and we can have no complaints. The bathroom in particular was stunning.
The staff here are very attentive and the couple of extra touches we got for our anniversary were lovely and very much appreciated.

Location wise the Marker is also a fantastic choice. The rooftop bar is amazing. The pool and wellness area is very nice and the setting makes it a great place to relax.
The only complaint I could have is that I didn‚Äôt stay for longer.

We will definitely be back to stay in The Marker again and can only hope that we have a similar experience and deal with staff as good at their job as Silvie.

Thanks to everyone at the Marker for a brilliant experience!",5,2018,10,29
206,Beautiful Hotel in a Great Location,"My other half booked this as a birthday treat and wow what a treat it was. From the moment we arrived at the Main Entrance, the staff were extremely helpful; didn‚Äôt feel rushed at check in and we were escorted to our room...even given the option of which floor we preferred. The hotel is extremely luxurious and the hotel rooms are perfect! 

We spent both of our evenings of the rooftop bar. And I would have happily stayed up there. I had the Solero cocktail which was delicious! The staff were great even on the slightly rainy Saturday evening. I wanted to take a blanket home! Even if you aren‚Äôt staying at the hotel, the rooftop bar is definitely worth a visit! 

Can‚Äôt wait to go back :-) ",5,2018,10,27
206,Excellent!,"The hotel is very well located in the docks of Dublin, just a stone's throw from the centre. From the reception to the breakfast room, the staff is exemplary. The rooms are spacious and the beds offer a wonderful sleeping comfort. I had a room facing Grand Canal Square on the 4th floor. It was very quiet and you couldn't hear anything from outside. The bathrooms on this side of the hotel are in light grey marble and also very spacious with bathtub and shower. Only the washbasin is mounted extremely low, which looks very nice but is not very comfortable.",5,2018,10,26
206,Lovely Stay with The Marker (but one small hiccup),"From the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by the lovely staff. The doorman Mo left a lasting impression as he greeted us at our early morning arrival. Arriving before 8 am after a flight from Morocco, we weren't sure if we would be able to get into our room right away. Fortunately, the front desk staff made sure we could get our room right away. The room was very clean and bright and being a member of the Leading Hotels, we were welcomed with a plate of fresh fruit and nuts. 

Having traveled to Dublin for a close friends wedding, we wanted to stay somewhere central to be close to many of the wedding festivities but also close to the attractions of Dublin. We found The Market to be perfectly located in what appeared to be a new area of town with a lot of new development. Our stay was comfortable and the hotel was pleasant all around. During our 5-night stay, we made use of the gym, spa, rooftop and on-site restaurants. All amentiies were fantastic. 

My only issue with the hotel would be the spa scheduling and staff. When I first arrived, I had made an early morning spa booking for 3 days following as they were completely booked until the coming Sunday. Having made the booking on a Thursday morning, I was advised that I would receive the booking confirmation within the hour. Well, a confirmation was never received and come Sunday after a weekend of wedding festivities (aka. late nights and drinking in Ireland) I forgot about my 10am treatment. Only at 1015 did I receive a call from the spa asking if I was coming. Of course, I told them I had forgotten and didn't receive confirmation and that we would be right down. By the time we filled out the forms and got changed, it was now 1040am and we were advised right before heading into our treatment that we would be paying FULL PRICE (250 Euros) for ONLY 20 minutes of treatment. Being somewhat my fault for forgetting about the appointment, I ended up paying but I was very displeased with the lack of coordination on the spa's behalf and that they only decided to call me after I was already 15 minutes late. When you typically should be at a spa 15 minutes before a treatment, I think I should have received a courtesy call at 9:55 am or 10 am at the latest to remind me of my appointment, let alone the day before like many luxury hotels will do for you as a courtesy. Anyway, a minor hiccup but certainly took away from being the perfect stay. 

Overall I had an excellent time in Dublin and a comfortable stay at the Market",4,2018,10,26
206,2nd Time Even Better,"This was my second stay at the Marker Hotel and they actually surpassed the first visit. The staff is amazing in that they treat you like a VIP, from the moment you pull up, through check-in, personally taking you to your room to the food and bar service. I really can't say enough about this place - the only place I'll ever stay in Dublin.",5,2018,10,25

206,Wonderful stay at this fabulous hotel,"Just returned this morning from a weekend stay with my friend and wanted to write my review quickly to let people know what a wonderful hotel this is.
Greeted by smiling, helpful, courteous, friendly staff on reception when we arrived quite late on Friday night. could not have wished for a better start and then.....the room.....fabulous. Spacious, luxurious, marvellous bathroom with cozy underfloor heating, bathrobe, slippers, ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...everything needed for a perfect stay.
Breakfast was scrummy, so much choice hot, continental etc etc etc
We only had room service for Pizza but it was delicious too.
The bar area was really welcoming and the roof terrace...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..stunning.
If you want a bit of class for your stay then look no further.
Every member of staff that we met and spoke with were just super. Nothing too much trouble.
The hotel is not right in the centre but that was one of the reasons I chose it, it is still easy to walk into the centre of Dublin if wanted, I have issues with my mobility and still managed to walk in 20 minutes and the hop on hop off bus stops just round the corner.
Did not have time to sample the lovely spa due to time but will do when we stay again.

Thank you to all for making our stay one to remember, cannot recommend enough.",5,2018,10,22
206,Excellent hotel,"Very good hotel with very helpful staff, luxurious rooms, nice bathroom with floor heating, great beds and everything that you could imagine. Nice bar. Bit pricey. Nicely located in the docks area. Close to the conference center. ",5,2018,10,19
206,Amazing and THE place to stay in Dublin - The Marker Hotel,"I stayed at The Marker Hotel for 6 nights while on a business trip to Dublin.  The hotel really is an amazing property and probably one of the, if not the best hotel in Dublin.

Rooms & Beds
- I stayed in Superior room for 5 nights and then was upgraded to Corner Suite for one night due to an issue with my room (generous upgrade my the hotel manager)
- The beds were extremely comfortable and I slept really well.  
- Pillows were soft and comfortable
- Both rooms were very spacious, but Corner Suite is absolutely stunning with 3 large windows for amazing city views
- Bathroom have heated tile floors which is a nice touch and really comfortable to walk around on
- Bathrooms were large, big tub, excellent shower and great water pressure

Amenities
- I used the gym, pool, sauna, and steam rooms - all excellent.  The gym is a smaller and can get a bit crowded, but I was able to get a great workout during my entire stay
- Pool is amazing and I enjoyed swimming a few nights

Service and Staff
- The service was really good overall, easy check-in/check-out
- Ordered food to the room, which was excellent, hot, and less than 30 min from time to order

Overall, this is a really good hotel and I had a really pleasant stay and would definitely stay here again.  One note is that the hotel is about 20 min walk from city center, so consider that if you plan on exploring the old part of the city.",5,2018,10,18
206,The place to stay in Dublin,Great location at the Grand Canal. Only a 20 min walk to the city centre and the bus stop 702/703 from the airport is just around the corner. Alot of very good resaturants at the Grand Canal Square. The staff at the hotel makes you fell very welcome and at home. ,5,2018,10,18
206,Excellent overnight stay.,"First time in this hotel. I had to attend a day course early Saturday in the conference centre of the hotel and stayed over on Friday night.
Excellent location and a lovely walk on the canal with eating and drinking places close by.
I had a meal in the Brasserie which was wonderful and great service as well as breakfast.
Very clean and quiet room with a great view.
Can highly recommend a stay here, but next time a few more nights.",5,2018,10,17
206,A perfect stay,"First stay at the The MARKER for our wedding anniversary.  The room, restaurant, the service, the spa and treatment were just perfect ! L'ap√©ritif on the roof top highly recommended ! We sure come back ! A modern hotel with an efficient team ! Quite close to the town center , 15 mn walk !",5,2018,10,16
206,Great Hotel and Location,"Couldn't recommend enough the food, staff and the bed were amazing, plus had the best massage ever from Sinead, location is ideal if going to 3Arena the Bord Gais Centre, or City Centre. While not the cheapest I felt we got value for money as Dublin itself can be quite expensive!",5,2018,10,16
206,The place to stay in Dublin,"I stay in a hotel about 100 nights a year.  It rates at the top of my choices.  From outstanding check in to the help from lobby staff.  Too many people to thank, one in particular was Raymond.  He was assisted by many wonderful staff members.",5,2018,10,16
206,Lovely stay,"Mostly fabulous from start to finish beds are comfy rooms are very nicely decorated, floor to ceiling windows and lovely views, coffee machine was great although everything else in the room (snacks etc) came at a cost. Valet parking is very nice touch and handy too.. the only 2 issues I had during the stay are small and does not in any way ruin our stay. We ordered room service for breakfast and the yogurt was very well out of date- not something to expect from such a high end hotel you would think their food safety would be more on point, made me wonder what else we did not notice about the rest of the food, secondly the staff at the hotel always addressed my parter instead of me when it came to everything even though the booking was in my name everything that needed to be signed was motioned toward him as well as that when it came to pay I presented the card and they handed the card machine then to him even though it was clearly from my purse and that I was paying although small and probably inadvertent it bothered me as I got the feeling that they presumed that he was paying because he was a man? It got uncomfortable sometimes as it was a repeat occurrence. Having said that both small incidents and will definitely be returning.",4,2018,10,15
206,"Leisure, attending concert is Bord g√°is theatre",I was attending a concert in Bord g√°is theatre Hotel is so close. Staff friendly only problem was booked taxi it never showed and no follow from reception. Concierge got me taxi. I did feel staff could me more helpful when leaving hotel,5,2018,10,15
206,Outstanding hotel in Dublin,"I recently stayed at The Marker for business for 3 nights.  The hotel has an outstanding location near the center of the city with plenty of options for dining and entertainment nearby.

The service at the hotel was first rate.  All the staff were courteous and helpful.  They were always ready to provide information and assist.

My room was a nice size with a great bathroom (love the heated floors), separate shower and tub with good water pressure.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the climate control functioned perfectly.  

The room was very functional for a three day stay and never felt like I didn‚Äôt have enough room or it wasn‚Äôt comfortable enough.  I appreciated the handwritten note from the manager and the gift which was a very welcome touch.

I travel a lot on business and always looking for a hotel that feels like a home away from home, The Marker will be mine in Dublin for sure",5,2018,10,12
206,Exceptional comfort and service,"Superb accommodations and comfort. Professional and cordial interaction with the staff, ease of access and a great location.

206,"Nice property, clean and quiet","Nice property, clean and quietVery good hotel, the only downside is the main restaurant is closed Sunday and Monday which is a negative for full service hotel. You can eat in the bar, but it‚Äôs very noisy if there‚Äôs theater going on next-door. And the menu is more limited. Other than that Issue, a very fine hotel",4,2018,10,11
206,Good hotel super staff and lovely location only gripe is breakfast,The Marker is a lovely hotel it‚Äôs clean well staffed and has a great buzz any time of the day. The rooms are a good size and so peaceful. I really enjoyed the feel of the place and would return. However I really did not enjoy the breakfast ... pretty awful really,4,2018,10,10

206,Absolutely excellent stay!,"We stayed at The Marker based on multiple reviews and recommendations from sites as well as hotel critics. I can safely say that the hotel lived up to its prestigious reputation. 

Location

The hotel is located in the Grand Canal Square at the Docklands. It‚Äôs 20 minutes walking from Dublin‚Äôs city center. There are literally dozens of pubs, restaurants and shops within walking distance of the property. 

Lobby

The hotel‚Äôs architecture is beautiful. The lobby is stylish and modern. It has a fantastic bar and and the hotel‚Äôs restaurant.  The restaurant offers breakfast, lunch and dinner. The breakfast included a full buffet, which was great. 

Room

The room was spacious. The bed was truly comfortable. The bathroom was also large with both a nice shower, a bathtub, heated floor and double sinks. 

Amenities 

The hotel has an indoor pool and a rooftop bar, which is a must for one to visit! The view from the rooftop is breathtaking.  

Service 

The service was TOP NOTCH. We were traveling in a large group. The hotel arranged transportation from and to the airport. They had our rooms ready and within minutes of arriving our luggage was brought up to our room. The concierges were tremendously helpful and super friendly. At the bar, (lobby and rooftop) the staff was fantastic. I want to openly commend Gary for his 5 star service and his magnificent efforts to make our stay enjoyable. 

Overall, this hotel is 5 stars and it shows. It absolutely recommend it and will definitely stay there again!

",5,2018,10,07
206,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed for two nights.

A very modern hotel with a lovely ambience. The rooms were well appointed and the breakfast was quite substantial. Staff were very friendly and obliging.

The surrounding area is quite well built up with a number of very good restaurants. A short walk around the corner brings you to the bus stop where you can get the green hop on, hop off service.",5,2018,10,07
206,Superb,"Superb in every way, an extremely high standard throughout and a very special experience, we were very well looked after by staff, nothing was too much trouble for them, from the initial arrival and valet parking service to our bags being promptly brought to our room the service was superb.  Staff are very knowledgable and also polite and discrete- I will definately return.",5,2018,10,04
206,Great way to end a long trip,"We decided to use some credit card rewards to pay for our weekend stay at the Marker and it was probably the best decision of the whole trip! The hotel is situated by the ""Silicon Docks"" of Ireland with Facebook and Ancestry.com around the corner. Every time you get to walk into the hotel, you most likely are walking past a beautiful view of the water and landscape outside of the hotel. Our room was incredibly nice. The bathroom had underfloor heating and a heated towel rack which was AMAZING to use and the tub was big enough for my fiance and I to comfortable fit in it. The housekeeping team would do the bathroom, make the bed, and tidied up which was a nice surprise to come home to. We also ordered a box of cronuts since we were arriving at 10 am from a 7 am flight and those were simply a fantastic welcome to the hotel. They were able to accommodate an early check-in too! The pool and spa areas seemed immaculate. The pool is incredibly nice and the perfect temperature. The jacuzzi was great to dip into, but the jets were a tad weak. I was hoping I could get some pressure on my back but c'est la vie. The sauna was great to use as well. Clearly posted instruction, nearby facilities, and clean. Overall, I absolutely look forward to the opportunity to stay here again. This was a wonderful pampering experience that had been long over due for us. ",5,2018,10,03
206,Great break to unwind,"Great break in lovely hotel with friendly 5* service. Not pretentious at all, warm and friendly just how I like it!  I would definitely recommend this hotel. We really enjoyed the break just to relax & unwind.",5,2018,10,03
206,Fantastic hotel in the heart of Dublin's dock area,"I have stayed here 25+ times over the last couple of years and never had a bad experience.  The staff are excellent, extremely helpful and professional.  The hotel rooms are excellent, well maintained, clean and comfortable.  The gym is small but good quality and the pool is lovely.",5,2018,10,03
206,Just one night but !!!,"We only stayed one night, but it was enough to assess that this was not a hotel that leaves anything to chance. Staff were friendly but courteous and not overpowering, the ambiance was pleasant and from arrival to departure it was an enjoyable experience. Happy to recommend.",5,2018,10,02
206,Very pleasant stay,"Very large and clean room.Location is good but not the best, we still had to walk around 20' to get to the city center. The good part is that it is away from all  the fuss.Breakfast could be richer.Overall very good.",5,2018,10,02
206,Amazing,"What can you say about this place. It's just class, staff are amazing as soon as you walk in they make you feel welcome and will go out of the way for you.  Rooms are amazing. Food and drink are perfect and rooftop bar amazing views ",5,2018,10,01
206,A Friday night in Dublin,"Spent a night in the marker. It‚Äôs a good location but traffic for the last few hundred metros was very heavy / Friday‚Äôs rush hour to be avoided
Our room was very nice and breakfast the next morning was very good 
Staff were friendly and helpful
We had room service when we arrived but needed to explain our simple requirements a few times and they still got it wrong 
Would I go back - ..., maybe !",4,2018,10,01
206,week with large group,"The Marker is great for business, not for fun. I would not think the location is good for a fun weekend as you have to add the cost of transport to the downtown area, also the breakfast is crap for the price",4,2018,09,28
206,Fabulous Weekend,Brilliant Overall stay.Great Service & amazing food had a lovely stay.loved the view from the Roof Top Bar & the coziness of the area.The hotel has beautiful modern design.Hope to make another visit soon!,5,2018,09,27

206,Chris and Bob's Ireland Vacation,"We arrived at the Marker shortly after noon on Sunday, September 23rd. Our rental car GPS made the location easy to find. The Marker was  impressive. The attendant upon arrival had a great sense of humor and was very helpful. We vale parked.A porter approached us offering to take our bags but we had only light carries. No pressure.The decor throughout the hotel, including the rooms was very tasteful and sparkingly clean.We were definitely pleased.",5,2018,09,26
206,DUBLIN'S BEST KEPT SECRET,"After 15 years of business in Dublin, I definitely chose The Marker as the best hotel in Dublin. Having stayed in 5 different venues this is, without any doubt, the best one. So awesome, so cool, such fabulous service, great location and checks every box you could ever want!",5,2018,09,24
206,"this is a great property ,we enjoyed every aspect of our stay","I would gladly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Ireland  , The staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay was enjoyable . Is there a Marker Hotel in Belfast  . Room service was excellent, the room was always clean and orderly . We really enjoyed the coffee selection in the mornings  ",5,2018,09,24
206,Upscale hotel with impeccable service,"The Marker is an upscale, well decorated hotel with good amenities. My only complaint is that it is VERY dark inside, especially the hallways and guest rooms. The service was impeccable and the concierge desk was extremely helpful in booking tours and arranging for taxis. It is a bit of walk to most of the tourist attractions.",5,2018,09,24
206,Making a Mark!,"Short and sweet... the Hotel is a quality place to stay in Dublin - Food was superb, The Staff couldn't do enough for you - Breafast served to the room was a real winner and the room was excellent - great views of Dublin.- the eucalyptus steam room really clears the head and a dip in 23mtr infinity pool is a must - dark interior colour scheme gives a sense of calm amidst all the hustle and bustle of a city centre hotel - very different and i loved it - the rooftop terrace bar is worth the room cost alone - amazing 360degree views of Dublin   nothing was too much trouble for the staff and we look forward to going back vey soon - the Marker definitely made a lasting mark on us!",5,2018,09,24
206,Beautiful hotel,"Absolutely stunning hotel in a beautiful part of Dublin. 
Located in front of Grand Canal Dock, there are plenty of eateries and bars within 3/4 mins from the hotel and then just another 10/15 min walk into the city centre. 
The hotel itself has an amazing rooftop bar, on the ground floor there is an open planned bar / restaurant also. 
Staff are extremely welcoming. 
The king deluxe room was very spacious, bed was very comfortable, beautiful modern bathroom with heated towels. All mod cons in the hotel room with a nice minibar and some nice snacks. 
Really enjoyable visit. ",5,2018,09,23
206,Great modern hotel,"Very nice hotel located next to the grand canal. Didn‚Äôt get the chance to explore the immediate area around the hotel, but walking into the centre of Dublin was a good 10-15 minute walk.Excellent attentive staff, the room and facilities were nipping clean and of a very high standard. I was travelling with my wife and 18 month old daughter. The staff were great with my daughter even when she was getting a bit rowdy when we went for what was quite an expensive breakfast. Would defo stay again. I did spend some time filling the loyalty card application out at check out but have not received any further correspondence, would like to know what happened there. Defo worth consideration if you can get a decent rate. ",4,2018,09,21
206,40th Birthday celebrations ,"We stayed at the Marker Hotel for 2 nights to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday.  We couldn't of picked a better hotel.  Perfect location, beautiful hotel, very helpful staff.  Nothing was to much trouble.  Would definitely recommend ",5,2018,09,21
206,Lovely stay,"A lovely hotel with attentive staff.  We will return.  Modern, a great location, although not in the ""heart"" of Dublin, it's in a vibrant location.  Rooftop bar is a must if the sun is shining,   Depending on the day and occupancy, it can be a bit pricey but is worth it (to us)",5,2018,09,19
206,Small thing took shine off what could of been an amazing stay,"We stayed recently for 3 nights . We arrived around 4pm and room was ready and we checked in very quickly . Room was lovely and much larger than expected . Bathroom was beautiful and under floor heating was lovely . 
Staff through our whole stay were on the whole very accomadating . Rooftop bar is worth a visit and blankets kindly supplied on a cooler night . 
Only complaint I really have was breakfast . First morning hot buffet was far from hot in fact it was lukewarm at best and I ended up only having fruit . Tea , coffee and juice was plentiful . Second morning I had eggs from menu and husband had pancakes both very very good and hot . Third morning we unfortunately came into breakfast after a huge American bus load and only table set up was beside the station were staff stand or go on computer beside a whole load of wire and beside the window where all the bus load of Americans were waiting on coaches to collect them which isn‚Äôt ideal . 
Food was again hot as we ordered straight from menu . 
Think hotel need to look at ways to keep hot food buffet hotter .",4,2018,09,19
206,Great Hotel Central Location,"Visited the hotel on business and it was a fantastic hotel in a great location. Staff were very helpful, rooms were to a very high standard and extremely comfotable. The facilities available were excellent.",5,2018,09,19
206,Nice Hotel,"Satisfied but expected more for the price. I spoke to staff about the lack of power outlets in the bathroom and also the lighting, but there was no interest shown in my communication. Also as mentioned when I compare it to other 5 star hotels, the Marker perhaps falls short for me.",3,2018,09,17

206,Great long weekend in Dublin!,"We had a great time in Dublin, and the Marker Hotel was a big part of the experience.  We arrived early after a long overnight trip from the US.  The hotel greeted us and made a room available right away.  The rooms are great.  Very big, very modern and very comfortable.  We also had the chance to enjoy the fabulous rooftop bar where you have fantastic views of the city.  Location was a big plus as well.  Within walking distance to many of the cities good sites.  We walked over to Trinity College and visited many great pubs along the way.  I would definitely recommend The Marker Hotel!",5,2018,09,11
206,An exciting and superb way to exprience Dublin in the highest standard of accomodation,10/10 all round review. one huge thumbs up and a must to experience whilst having the pleasure of visiting Dublin.

We had a corner suite which was large and airy, the bathroom was spacious and the bath itself was lovely! Never stayed in this part of Dublin before but it‚Äôs only a 15/20 minute walk up to the city centre & Temple Bar. Will definitely stay here again.

206,The most comfortable beds!!,"Our room was very clean with an amazing bathroom (we enjoyed the heated floors) and comfortable bed.

206,Superbly appointed rooms,Just finished a marvelous short mid-week stay at the Marker. I was very impressed with the rooms (stayed in a Deluxe King). The finish and standard of the fixtures and fittings was sensational and the spa area is one of the finest I have seen for a city hotel. Well done Marker!,5,2018,09,03
206,Standard business traveller hotel,"Nice location, standard service as expected at this level of hotel. No positive surprises, no differentiator. Staff was nice. 
Negative: not enough electricity sockets in the apartment. No socket for 220V in the bathroom. 
Small wardrobe, filled with additional duvet and pillows... noisy floors. The cleaning staff was overly active when offering turndown service and I am wondering if this is still required in current world, but little effort was maid to clean the apartment in time convenient to me, not to their schedule. Their gym is small and the aircon is insufficient, gym closes down at 20:00 on weekends... one would expect 24/7 access.
Positive:
Nice restaurant. Very nice wellness and choice of massages. Mango sorbet and fresh orange juice as a small but very nice treat after massage. 
Overall: Very friendly and helpful customer facing personnel. Not worth in terms of value received for the money spent.",3,2018,09,03
206,Absolutely the best!,"Our stay at the Marker hotel was amazing! This is one of best hotels I've ever stayed in. It's located close to the downtown, yet is in a very quite area. The hotel staff was courteous and friendly. We've arrived at the hotel at around 8:00 am, but our room was ready for us even though the original check-in time was 3:00 pm. The check-in process was simply a breeze. We stayed 2 nights at the beginning of our trip to Ireland, and came back after 5 days traveling through the country side. When we cam back for our 3rd night stay, the receptionist Andrea and other hotel staff have recognized us. The check in process was even faster. than the first time. The hotel and our room was impeccably clean. Our room was spacious and cozy. the toiletries very exceptional. The bathroom had heated floors! I'm very happy with my hotel choice!",5,2018,09,03
206,Excellent stay,We just enjoyed a fabulous stay at the Marker - the service was exceptionally food at breakfast/check in and check out. The facilities are gorgeous especially the rooftop bar and the lovely pool/spa area. Would thoroughly recommend.,5,2018,09,02
206,good hotel for business visitors,"the title of my review summarizes my feelings. very good - modern,clean, in the business area. given that it was our first visit to dublin it was the wrong choice for us since the neighbourhood felt like it could be in any city in the world. so we will have to go back to experience historic dublin. the marker was bustling with sleek business sorts of people. the rooms were nice - we had a suite that was bright and cheery. my only grouse is that all the doors - to and within the suite - are very heavy wooden doors that are hard to push so clearly for a young-ish demographic or a strong-backed demographic. had i been in dublin on work in the neighborhood of the marker i would give it five stars.",4,2018,09,01
206,"Lovely hotel, great anniversary treat","Our stay at the Marker Hotel was extremely enjoyable and we would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Dublin. The only issue we experienced was during check in and check out, we decided to book a spa package for our first night and then just the standard room rate for our remaining two nights on the Marker website. Despite calling in advance to explain what we had done and being assured we would be in the same room (we didn‚Äôt want a 3 night spa package) it still caused quite a few issues at check in and we were initially told that we would have to change rooms in the morning. In the end though the reception staff sorted it so we managed to stay in the same room. But this did cause quite a bit of frustration and during the rest of our stay also confusion to be on separate packages, so I would recommend making your life easier and just booking one. Despite this we still had a thoroughly enjoyable stay. We loved the hotel, it‚Äôs location, the spa (treatments were excellent), the roof top bar (fab views), the room (lovely views and massive bathroom, extremely comfortable beds too), and the staff were lovely. We will definitely be returning again.",4,2018,09,01
206,Pampered to the limit,"Our stay at The Marker during our vacation to Ireland was FANTASTIC!  Every staff member we encountered was attentive to our needs, even the housekeeping of our room.  We couldn't have asked for a better experience.  I would, without hesitation, highly recommend staying at this fabulous hotel!!",5,2018,08,30
206,Modern Luxury in downtown Dublin,"You get the type of experience you expect with the price tag. Decent location, loved using the pool/spa facilities after the long flight/jetlag.

Our room was ready early which was a huge help in taking a quick nap right off the plane. Staff was helpful and roomservice was tasty and on time.",5,2018,08,30
206,Amazing !!!!,"A fabulous hotel, with prime location.  The staff without exception are wonderful representatives for The Marker, so helpful and knowledgeable .  We had a light meal in the Marker Bar and it was excellent, the breakfast is also fantastic with so much  choice and comfort.  No feeling of being rushed  which is sometimes the case.  The accommodation is also of the highest standard - we will continue to go to the Marker when travelling to Dublin .  ",5,2018,08,29
206,BEST HOTEL IN DUBLIN.....,"This hotel is just stunning.  Service was great, rooms amazing and soo quiet.  Spa and pool are out of this world.  The rooftop bar is a great location and the food in the restaurant looked lovely.  We had the breakfast which was first class.Booked again for January.  Perfect location for the Theatre",5,2018,08,29
206,Fab hotel,Highly recommend this hotel.  We were here on business and it was great.  Staff very professional very attentive.  Food great for our rooftop party.  Breakfast selection excellent.  Hotel room very spacious and comfortable. ,5,2018,08,29
206,"Great hotel, good location, and perfect service","We spent two nights at this really great hotel. The service was perfect, we even could check-in very early. I definitely can recommend the rooftop bar and the breakfast. The city center and many of the main points of interest are in walking distance.",5,2018,08,28
206,Saturday night,"breakfast was cold. some staff not up to 5 star standards. location was good, and a new age vibe about the hotel. the beds were comfortable, but the rooms were not that big. overall the hotel is not worth the high cost",3,2018,08,28
206,Very good hotel with almost no faults,"Everything in this hotel was excellent. The only two things I was not very fond of were the shower (super low pressure) and the scrambled eggs for breakfast were still runny (I prefer my scrambled eggs cooked well, so it‚Äôs a personal opinion)",5,2018,08,28
206,family trip in dublin,excellent hotel and personalized service. the staff shows great attention to the customer. proactive and kind.  a luxury service and a great location for travel and sightseeing. I highly recommend this hotel,5,2018,08,28
206,great spot,"Terrific staff all round at a very busy time. Nice location especially for those who enjoy walking to justify some rather nice Dublin food adventures, Fully priced but it was a very busy time in Dublin with some combo of hurling final and then the Pope's visit!",5,2018,08,28
206,An amazing stay,From start to finish our stay was fantastic. The staff are superb and could not do enough to make your stay special. The extra touch of wishing my husband happy birthday and sending a little treat to the room was just the icing on the cake. We will definitely be back and this is the best hotel we have stayed in so far!,5,2018,08,27
206,Great hotel,Stunning hotel with a great restaurant and roof top bar. We stayed for a couple of nights to end a Ireland holiday & it was very luxurious. The staff really could not do more for us. Borrowed the bikes for a quick cycle down to the coast after checking out before we needed to head off to the airport.,5,2018,08,27
206,First class in excellent location,Top class hotel in a great location. Took bus from airport to Convention Centre and walked over bridge so ~20 minutes. Concierge easy flagged taxis for going out. Room was very large and lovely and clean with crisp white linen. ,5,2018,08,24
206,A lovely stay,I was originally thinking of staying somewhere in Temple Bar but after having read that some guests in some hotels couldn‚Äôt get to sleep until 3am due to noise from revellers I thought I would try a little further afield.   We thought we would go for an upmarket hotel and we weren‚Äôt disappointed.   I won‚Äôt list everything we liked because it was indeed everything.  The beautiful bathroom we had was around the size of one of our bedrooms at home and the basin almost as big as our bath!  Almost.   You could get four people in to the bed but as in a previous post my wife said no.  There was a small gap next to the curtain that let a little light in but just a little.  There were just two tea bags in the room and four would be more suitable.   Instructions for the coffee machine/hot water dispenser would be an idea too.   It took us around twenty minutes to walk in to the main tourist area and it wasn‚Äôt until the last day that we found that we could walk five minutes to the train station and go a couple of stops in to town for just a few pounds.  At least we were burning off the lovely breakfasts!,5,2018,08,22
206,Special !!!!,"From the moment you pull up at The Marker, you are greeted by warm welcoming staff , who will automatically make your check in as smooth as possible . On this occasion, we were greeted by Ruan , who informed us that as the hotel wasn‚Äôt very busy they could offer us an upgrade ,for a minimal charge and we got the presidential suite . Wow doesn‚Äôt quite cut it . It was simply stunning and the views were amazing. It uses the same decor and finishes used in the rest of the hotel but just so much more  . We spent the rest of the day in the swimming pool and spa area , which we had all to ourselves and then ordered room service for dinner , which was beautiful . The breakfast the next morning was excellent and probably the best eggs benedict I‚Äôve ever had . All of the staff are charming , friendly and have a bit of craic about them . I simply cannot fault this hotel in any way and look forward to returning many times",5,2018,08,21
206,The best cocktails on the rooftop,Amazing cocktails and beautiful view on the rooftop of the hotel:) Nice friendly staff.. I spent so nice time with my friends there. Cocktails are a little bit expensive but it‚Äôs worth it:) I can recommend.,5,2018,08,19
206,"Excellent hotel but even so, prices are cheeky!","We went to a show at the Bord Gais Theatre so location was brilliant. The hotel was stylish and well kept. Staff were very pleasant and helpful. The room was average size, clean and very comfortable. The sound of voices carries in the halls. 
Breakfast (full irish, toast, tea, oj) was ‚Ç¨57 for two of us and parking was ‚Ç¨24 for one night. 
The cost of the room for two guests for one night was ‚Ç¨399. I mistakenly thought this price included breakfast and that parking was free.... for that i would not have minded the price, however the experience was not worth ‚Ç¨490!!
While I can not complain about the experience, it was great, they seriously need a reality check on prices.",4,2018,08,19
206,Best hotel in Ireland!,"Not only is the hotel stunning, but the service and friendliness of the staff is above and beyond. Will be coming back many more times. I highly recommend checking out the rooftop bar for a cocktail. The food is also superb!",5,2018,08,19
206,Simply wonderful ,"I haven't stayed at every hotel in Dublin, but this is easily my favourite. Gorgeous rooms, lovely decor and very attentive and friendly service which never feels forced or affected. We stayed here as a family for a family member's birthday and I'd go back there in a heartbeat.
If you're staying here, make sure you use the swimming pool/sauna, too- I didn't get enough time to take full advantage of those facilities but I'll be back! ",5,2018,08,18
206,Mixed Bag,The room was nice though the bathroom not all that functional due to the modern design.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The lobby a bit too modern for my taste.  The roof top bar was cold in June and the view so so nothing to rave about in my mind.  The biggest problem from a tourist standpoint too far removed from the center on the other hand the price was more reasonable than those in the center.  If I had a do over I would pay more and stay more in the city.  Last thought not enough restaurants in the area to serve the folks out there we had a difficult time finding one that could take us for dinner.  So those are my thoughts.  Not bad but other factors made it not so desirable.,3,2018,08,18
206,Great hotel with wonderful staff,"We had a wonderful time at The Marker hotel, everything about our stay was fantastic. The staff were extremely pleasant and could not do enough for us; a special thanks to Tony in reservations for all his help. We will be back.",5,2018,08,17
206,Excellent stay with a beautiful view !!,The marker hotel is located by the canal and it offers a very good view over it.The rooms are very spacious.The staff is very warm and hospitable.The  breakfast spread is very good and the bar offers some fablous cocktails.We stayed for 2 nights from april 27-29th and even got to witness a fashion event over there.,5,2018,08,17
206,Spring Break - Outstanding Last Night!,"Wow! Great Welcome when you walk in the door and are greeted with a Guinness! I came with my son to Ireland and we decided to stay at The Marker Hotel for our final night in Ireland.  This was the perfect location - plus it was St. Patrick's Day. The front desk staff were warm and welcoming - even though we were there well before check in - they had us check-in and sent us up to our room with an outstanding view and amazing bathroom!! The room itself is roomy - We each had our own space for our luggage and ""stuff"" from 10 days touring across Ireland.  We then went out to tour for our final day - after all we wanted to go to the parade and be back for dinner. My son remained out to take photos and I returned to check out the rooftop bar - OUTSTANDING! Amazing view. I expected the rain - but it began to hail and then snow - watching it come in over the water was so unique. The service was outstanding and so was my martini. My son arrived as I finished my second and we went downstairs to the lobby bar and reserved a table for dinner.  There is a duo playing and singing ""trad"".  Again, wonderful Irish food - my son got a burger and there were a number of vegetarian choices for me.  Next time we are back in Dublin, we will definitely stay here again!! This is a definite 5 STARS!!!",5,2018,08,16
206,Orlaith OBrien,"Have stayed here twice now and amazing each time (once leisure and once business). Easy walk into Grafton Street from Pearce Street.If you're staying in Grand Canal - Herbstreet, HQ and Fresh are great places for food",5,2018,08,16
206,"5 star all the way, fantastic staff & great location","I have been The Marker many times for dinner, drinks and meetings. This was just the second time that I booked in for a weekend stay. We had a fantastic time.  The staff are incredible. It is beyond me how they can remember everyone's name, especially considering the hotel was fully booked! Special thanks to Vladimir (concierge / porter / valet parking) who made our stay extra special. I booked directly with the hotel several months ago and also requested reservations for the rooftop terrace on both evenings; our table was reserved and waiting for us on both occasions. The new rooftop menu is delicious (thanks Gar Mullins!) and breakfast is always a lovely start to the day. The rooms are spacious and immaculate, no shortage of amenities, or fluffy towels in the sizeable plush ensuite! The underfloor heating is lovely in the bathroom & the beds are just so comfortable. Can't wait to return again soon.",5,2018,08,15
206,Wonderful and friendly,"Great experience staying at this hotel. Friendly staff, pleasant surroundings, comfortable rooms with great amenities.  Rooftop bar was exceptional. Would recommend this hotel for travelers and business events.",5,2018,08,14
206,Company trip to Ireland,"The rooms were very spacious and the heated bathroom floor was nice.  The roof top bar doesn't stay open late enough.  We came back from shopping later than expected and we couldn't get served by the restaurant downstairs, since they close at 10pm.  You can order room service 24 hours a day though.  Everything else was great!",4,2018,08,14
206,Nice hotel!,We stayed at The Marker as a part of big group and very happy with our stay. Room was big and clean. The maid made our bed twice a day. All personal was very nice and helpful. Great place and great location!,5,2018,08,14
206,Fantastic Hotel,Beautiful rooms and superior service.  During a recent family vacation we were treated to a great stay at the Marker.  A fantastic hotel.  Don't miss the rooftop bar.  All the necessary amenities and great location.,5,2018,08,14
206,Awesome hotel,The Marker is in a part of the city where it is easy to walk just about anywhere.  If you can't walk you can take the Hop On Hop Off bus around the city.  The staff is so willing to help.  The rooms are cleaned daily and they have turn down service.  Can't think of anything negative to say.  Would definitely stay there again if I were in Dublin.,5,2018,08,14
206,Amazing first time in Dublin....all thanks to the wonderful staff at The Marker Hotel!,"Words cannot express my thanks to the AMAZING STAFF at The Marker Hotel, namely - Silvie Ujjobbadova, Leon Ashmore, Fernando Amatore and lest I forget, Deidre Dwyer.   I booked this trip for my boyfriend's birthday and crammed a lot of activity into a long weekend, and am VERY thankful for the staff at the hotel for making this memorable. 

I booked the corner suite for my boyfriend's birthday, but due to a couple mechanical issues with the room, we had to switch out rooms on the first night, but the hotel staff all quickly worked to fix the issue, and ensure that we were enjoying our stay.  Leon and Fernando made sure that we enjoyed our first day, after sensing we were extremely tired from all the travel.

The rooms are definitely well appointed, and sumptuous, to say in the least.  I really did NOT to want to leave!  

After our quick three day trip to Ireland, and stay at The Marker Hotel, we left with fond memories of the people, the culture and the truly fantastic hospitality.  We cannot wait to return!   Thank you to the wonderful staff at the hotel --- Silvie, Diedre, Leon and Fernando.   You made our trip truly special!!!

206,Luxury at its best!,"We stayed 10 nights in Ireland, 9 of which were in B&Bs and we decided to spoil ourselves on our last night with a stay at The Marker. We were not disappointed! Beautiful, spacious room, insane bathroom, great pool, hot tub, delicious room service, I could go on and on!! Loved our stay!",5,2018,08,12
206,Superb stay at this lovely hotel with impeccable service.,"My husband and I had a glorious nine day stay at The Marker in July. We have traveled all over the world and have enjoyed many excellent hotels, however, never has the personal service, care, and attention to our needs and wishes matched that of The Marker.",5,2018,08,11
206,Consistently excellent ,Popped into the bar area in the foyer for a bite before the theatre. Once again l was so impressed with the friendly professional staff. Great menu selection and food delicious. They go the extra mile with little details such as the homemade cookies served with coffee. Highly recommend. ,5,2018,08,11
206,Superior,Wonderful hotel...best in Dublin.  Down by the hip docks area.  U2 recording studio one block away.  Theatre is steps from hotel as is 3 concert hall.  About 1-2 miles from City center..short cab ride or make the walk,5,2018,08,10
206,Beautiful & 1st Class,What an amazing place. The staff is so attentive and kind. The whole hotel is so beautiful. The breakfast buffet is so well stocked and you can order of the menus as well. The rooms are superior. The pool is Olympic size and heated to 90. Location is perfect to the city.,5,2018,08,09
206,"Stay Sunday, Spa Monday","We booked the Stay Sunday, Spa Monday package it was a very good deal. The staff is very accommodating and friendly. The room is so stylish and we have a good view of the river and Bord Gaise Theatre. They have a superb housekeeping staff. Went to the Rooftop Bar you can see the beautiful landmarks of  Dublin city, look for Kevin he is awesome. The lounge Bar staff was very nice. Breakfast is very good as well as their service staff. The spa treatment is the icing in the cake, it‚Äôs was so relaxing and the therapists is very good. Surely will be back again.",5,2018,08,09
206,Phenomenal experience,"I only stayed here for one night as part of the business visit but what a stay it was! From convenient location, to decor and quality of rooms, on-site facilities and service, the overall hotel experience was superb. Staff couldn't be more welcoming and professional, rooms were very comfortable and stylish, top-class hotel bar serving excellent cocktails- anything you expect from a high-end hotel- The Marker Hotel delivered effortlessly.",5,2018,08,09
206,Phenomenal hotel just 25 mins walk / 5 minute taxi into town,"Basically a perfect hotel experience: the service, the rooms (quiet, great climate control, comfortable), the rooftop lounge, all of it just plain perfect. I have literally nothing negative to write. Even the minor fly in the ointment -- we were placed in an Accessible room upon check-in which is suboptimal if only because the open shower splashes water all over the bathroom floors (making it slippery to the point of being dangerous) but were promptly moved the next day.

Although the hotel is 25 min walk / 5 min taxi from the center of Dublin (it's located in the Grand Canal area, a sort of London's Canary Wharf district), I was tempted to leave 4 dots for ",5,2018,08,08

Excellent location, very friendly staff, lovely rooms, great cocktails.

Pool/steam room and spa were very relaxing.

Breakfast was very nice but prosecco/cava would have been very welcome in an hotel of this quality
  

",5,2018,08,08
206,Liked it!,"Beds super comfortable, no problem getting a lighter duvet. Would agree with a previous reviewer that there isn't quite enough drawer space. Bathroom spacious, excellent shower. 

Couldn't fault the breakfast buffet and freshly cooked eggs, or the service which was so friendly. Some of the reception staff were very straight faced. The rooftop bar, once we finally gained admittance, was great - such views.",4,2018,08,07
206,great views,"came here to the rooftops for drinks in July and was so impressed with the views and service was exceptional..
on arrival we thought we could go straight up in the lift to the rooftop but we were told that it was full and we could have a drink in the lobby if we wanted to wait. there is also a nice seating area out the front so we ordered a drink at  the bar and by the time we paid the hostess came over and told us there was an available seat upstairs.
all the staff were so friendly, offering us different seats/blankets etc",5,2018,08,07
206,Business/ Leisure Trip,As soon as I entered The Marker Hotel to checking out the whole experience was 5 star and would recommend The Marker to anyone for a great relaxing hotel and staff are excellent and very professional - the rooftop bar is a great addition also and a must visit when you stay,5,2018,08,07
206,Staff and food,"Went to the bar for food before seeing a show and was very pleased. Staff were friendly and food was quick , presentation and taste was amazing children‚Äôs option was delicious and healthy with sides of plenty of vegetables presented in a way my 5 year old loved it all. 
Asked to see roof top and a young lady Aoife brought us up and showed  us the view and asked if we would like photos taken so friendly and professional I was very impressed. Have heard mixed reviews so felt I had to share me experience. It was excellent.",5,2018,08,07
206,A wonderful hotel with outstanding Service,Great visit although a fair walk to many sites.  Doormen were especially helpful.  The rooms and room services were exceptionally well done.  Suggestions for dinners in local area were fantastic.  Part of a meeting but better than I would usually expect..,5,2018,08,06
206,Where to put your clothes ?,"I stayed recently in June for a week at the Marker Hotel in Dublin. The location of the hotel is excellent, in particular if you attend a congress at the nearby congress center. Not too far outside from the city center either, you can do it by walking if the weather allows. The employees are all great, kind, helpful, spreading a pleasant atmosphere around. The concierge very efficient. Breakfast is perfect, nice service. The rooms are quite OK, BUT; where to put your clothes?, coats, suits, shoes etc. There is just available space enough to depose a tooth brush. If you travel a s a couple and each of you bring more than one suit or coat and more than three shirts and pullovers, you run in a serious trouble. I wonder if the architect who had conceived the inner outfit of the room has ever traveled with more than one piece of luggage? Beside this criticism, the Marker should be highly recommended.",4,2018,08,05
206,Great Hotel in Downtown Dublin,Wonderful hotel with a very accommodating staff.  Eager to give suggestions or directions when needed.  The rooftop bar had an amazing view of the city and a great selection of beers and wines  with spiced nuts for snacking.  Would stay again for sure!,5,2018,08,04
206,Seriously great service - well done,Popped in here for food in advance of the Wicked show in the Bord Gais and despite it being really busy with guests and parties .. the food and service given to us was really top class .. its a great art to make people feel wanted and a great art to do it when your busy .. I guess they just want everyone to feel good .. food was great and well prepared and all the serving staff were smiling and attentive .. then when they personalise the goodbye .. they had me .. cannot wait to be back to try this impressive emporium.,5,2018,08,03
206,Excellent hotel,Very well appointed hotel with excellent staff in all areas . Room is modern and very well equipped . Breakfast very good . Rooftop bar excellent . The staff are the key ingredient . Obviously well managed,5,2018,08,03

Staff are v friendly and extremely helpful 
You will yearn to get back here....
Location is perfect for relaxation with the buzz off Dublin and temple bar on your doorstep ",5,2018,07,31
206,Weekend break,Excellent weekend break at this modern hotel which is in an excellent location with several bars and restaurants nearby. Hopped on the tour bus round the corner at bus stop 7 on both days and our trip into the centre was both informative and hilarious. Worth a try!! Staff all extremely friendly and helpful particularly Nicole on reception when we checked in. Visited rooftop bar on Friday evening and were accommodated by all staff here with no issues. Hotel is rather pricey however it is in line with other similar properties in the city. Temple bar area within walking distance but far enough away for to enjoy a wander about and a few drinks then retreat back to this relaxing haven. Bar and restaurant still have a good vibe during the evening particularly due to proximity theatre area. Would return.,5,2018,07,31
206,Just perfect,"We stayed here for just one night (would happily have stayed a month) during a quick trip to Dublin. 

The hotel was beautiful. Clean, modern, grand, it felt very special. 

Huge floor to ceiling windows along two sides of our room and a lovely view. The huge thick curtains and soft bed (with about 8 choices of pillows) made for a luxurious nights sleep. 

Staff were all very courteous and helpful. All smiles too which makes a huge difference. 

Very easy little stroll into the city centre or a few euros in an Uber. 

We are planning on coming back in November and we will stay here again- usually we like to try different hotels but this place made for some lovely memories and we will return. 

Bath and shower (separate) both great too. 

Thank you very much staff.",5,2018,07,31
206,Lovely stay,Really enjoyed our stay on Saturday. We stayed for one night for a bridal party and we couldn't recommend it enough. The staff were so friendly and helpful. The rooms were great. Beds are so comfortable. Our dinner that night was so nice too. Was a great stay ,5,2018,07,31
206,Amazing from start to finish!,I cant thank the staff at the marker hotel enough.. since me and my partner arrived they were amazing.. the dinner and breakfast was outstanding we couldn't fault anything. They helped me so much on planning my proposal on rooftop bar which all ran just how i wanted it to.. special thanks to Tony and Fernando for making this a fabulous stay for me and my now fiance!  ,5,2018,07,31
206,Excellent hotel - Dublin's shining jewel!,"I stayed here for a week and was very well taken care of. 

I was in a King Deluxe room. It was immaculate and equipped with nice amenities.

The Marker has one of the nicest spa/ pool areas I have ever had the privilege of indulging in. The pool is very large, perfect for swimming laps. There is also a sauna, jacuzzi, and steam room. Plenty of bean bag chairs and lounge chairs to relax on ... I may have fallen asleep on one, and I apologize to fellow guests if I snored!

I had breakfast and dinner at The Marker. Both are nothing short of delightful. The breakfast buffet has a generous selection for all diets. Coffee and tea both tasted very good. For dinner I had a cocktail and a small plate of food. It was evening and the lounge was full of other guests, but they weren't too loud and I still got to read and do some writing while sipping my cocktail. 

The location is perfect. Next door neighbors with the Bord Gais Energy Theater, right in the heart of the scenic Grand Canal Docks. The River Liffey is a short stroll away, and just another 20 minutes walk and you're at O'Connell Bridge. 

The staff are all courteous and professional. The Marker is an excellent hotel. I recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing, warm, refined experience in Dublin.",5,2018,07,30
206,Business Trip,Stayed at The Marker during a business trip to Dublin. The property was fantastic and I highly recommend! The service from every employee was very friendly and the hotel was immaculate. Also the beds were very comfortable.,5,2018,07,30
206,Spectacular Hosting!,"We had the best wedding celebration - Our Daughters wedding at the Marker Hotel, Dublin on 7th July 2018. The Marker was the best place to Host the wedding carefully selected by the couple almost a year in advance! The Staff in particular were so courteous, friendly, obliging and Professional. We were treated like celebrities on the wedding day. The ambiance of the hotel is like no other, the setting- spectacular, the food - gourmet . The roof top experience was breath taking with clear blue skies and fantastic views all around. This is the perfect place for an special ocassion. It was worth ever dime we spent, and will remain in our hearts forever!. Great Job to the Staff   of the Marker, Dublin, Ireland.",5,2018,07,29
206,Pre theatre ,"Want to say a big thank you to all the staff at The Marker.

Especially Aiofe the host of the rooftop bar.
A big smile on entry and a big thank you on exit.

We walked up on opening night of a show at the theatre and thought we would chance our arm at sampling some of the cocktails on offer 

Not disappointed at all from atmosphere and great views, to friendly staff and great drinks 

Keep up the good work!",5,2018,07,29
206,Business trip,"Overall, my stay was great except for unbending policies. That's why 4 stars.

I mistake was made booking and extra night and I was told the charge would be removed but it wasn't. I understand it is a policy but to have continues relationships with customers this request should have been accommodated.  I will stay in a different hotel during my business trips to Dublin.",4,2018,07,29

206,Wonderful Hotel with Fabulous staff,"From the time you enter the hotel you are treated wonderfully.  The rooms are lovely, the Spa area has a great jacuzzi and a 23 meter pool along with sauna and steam room.  The staff is unbelievably kind and friendly.  A great place to go to be pampered.  It‚Äôs about a 20 minute walk to town but there is also plenty of restaurants, pubs and shops nearby.  I loved it!",5,2018,07,27
206,Excellent service and location,"When booking our hotel for a recent stay in Dublin, I really struggled with deciding between the Marker and a hotel more centrally located in the downtown area - I am so glad we decided to stay at the Marker. We loved the location - easy access to downtown, but away from the crowds and noise. Add to that, the Marker was great - excellent service, nice rooms and the breakfast was delicious. My only negative would be to say  the the hallways are quite dark which I found odd, but that's really quibbling. Lovely hotel, I would highly recommend.",5,2018,07,26
206,The most amazing hotel we have ever stayed in.,We just got back from a night away at the Marker Hotel. It was a very special occasion for us and every single member of the staff at the Marker made us feel so welcome. Our room was beautiful and the food was delicious. The roof terrace was excellent with incredible views of the city. We can‚Äôt wait to visit again. Thanks to the Marker Hotel staff for such an unforgettable stay.,5,2018,07,26
206,Excellent property,"This hotel was a very great surprise!
The facilities, accommodation, staffs, food and bevereges are very good! Also has a great location near the Convention Center and the business district. And you can walk around 20 minutes to get some of the main city atractions.
Thanks for the Chef, I had the best pepper sauce ever on my steak!!
I do recommend it!",5,2018,07,26
206,Quick drink ,"Popped in for a drink before going to see Wicked.  Very busy lunch trade , only seats were near the bar . Drinks were served promptly,  will be back to try the food offerings.  Nicely air conditioned area in a top hotel .",5,2018,07,25
206,Anniversary trip,"What an outstanding hotel. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left it was perfect. The service was exceptional. Every single member of staff who walked by said hello and asked if we were ok.
The breakfast was really good.
The swimming pool was pretty cool. The spa was very relaxing and so were the treatments, and even though there was a little mix up the staff sorted it immediately and were very good about it.
The rooftop bar had an awesome view and good service and cocktails.
Overall, a really enjoyable stay. If you don't want to stay too close to the city centre but are happy to walk 15 to 20mins or get a taxi then this is thw prefect retreat for you.",5,2018,07,24
206,Weekend break with the kids,"Hotel and staff were amazing from the moment we stepped out of the taxi till the time we left. We came to watch Riverdance with my two little girls (aged 10 and 12) and they absolutely adored the hotel and the facilities. 

I did have some issues with my luggage which had been lost by air lingus and the concierge was absolutely brilliant took all the details and contacted the airline directly to get updates and promptly advised me of the status. This meant i could still spend quality time with the kids without worrying or spending time away from them trying to chase things up. 

All the staff from the doorman, special mention to the concierge (cant remember is name) to the chap who bought the children extra goodies for room service (got our initial order slightly wrong), to the checking in staff,  the staff at breakfast and all at the roof bar were fantastic. The kids want to come again as do I!!",5,2018,07,24
206,Marker Hotel,Very clean and a comfortable room. Bathroom was huge with  a walk in shower. Nice touch from the hotel setting out a plate of sweet treats for my fiancee birthday. Location ideal for a great night out.,5,2018,07,24
206,Good location near the Convention Center,"The hotel is very comfortable, clean and people receive you in a very kind way. Breakfast is delicious, with natural ingredients. The hotel is located close to the Convention Center, so it's a good option for people attending a meeting there. The only thing that had disappointed me was the lack of attention to the environment. Even hanging the towels as indicated, they were changed daily.",4,2018,07,23
206,Excellent hotel ,Great Hotel with excellent facilities and restaurant. Not very far from the city centre. Outstanding breakfast and service from the staff at the restaurant. Very helpful staff at the front desk. Will definitely go back when next time in Ireland ,5,2018,07,23
206,Weekend Stay,Our stay at The Marker was fantastic. From check in the staff could not do enough for us. We ate in the hotel and then had drink on the rooftop which was stunning.  The hotels attention to detail was amazing. I would definitely recommend and would most certainly stay again.,5,2018,07,23
206,Good but not extraordinary,"I stayed here for a weekend with my boyfriend. To be honest I was expecting a bit more because I had read so many good reviews.
The room was nice, not spacious also but not small. The bathroom though, seemed totally outdated with a sort of old shower, and very few towels. 
Breakfast was very nice, however I was disappointed to see that they still charge you extra for some dishes. I mean, I paid more than 400 euros per night, and you want to get a few extra euros for serving me eggs benedict? Not cool.
The pool was very small with only a few lounge chairs to relax. There were three other couples there, so they were all taken.
Luckily the massage I had was really good. I think this made the whole review go from 2 to 3 stars. I would definitely recommend to get at least one treatment here, it was a total delight!
The definite downside was the fact that on saturday night there was a wedding party in the ground floor. The music was loud and it was extremely noisy, making it impossible to sleep until the party was over. So if you are planning on staying here, I would definitely recommend asking beforehand if they have an event scheduled or not.
I think that when you go over a certain price range, you expect to be ensured a good night sleep. In this case, the hotel should hace notified guests about this party. If I had known, I would have stayed somewhere else. Oh well, next time I am in Dublin, I definitely will.",3,2018,07,22
206,"QUIET hotel, wonderful staff & delightful breakfast","We traveled to Ireland & Scotland from the US during the first week of July. Our first stop was Dublin and a stay at this hotel. This hotel is really quiet and the beds are very comfortable. We did not hear anyone at night. The doors are very heavy and tall and seemed soundproof. I would stay here again but I would book a basic King room and save the $$. 

Food: The breakfast included in the pre-pay rate is WORTH IT! They have a buffet and then you can order off the menu in addition to the buffet, all included. The omelettes and the pancakes were really good. The girl who worked breakfast- Tuathe (pronounced TWO-LA) was amazing. She remembered us and was super friendly each day. 
There is a roof top bar. It has a wonderful view but pricy drinks and the food is snack like and not worth it. $60 bill for two drinks and some hummus dip and they gave us like 4 tiny pieces of bread. Concierge will get you a table if you stay at hotel. This is where the peeps from FB & Google go after work so expect a trendy 20-something crowd.It is worth it for the view, but you can go up to just look around and not drink.  

Rooms:We had upgraded our room to a luxury corner suite but when we arrived we had the basic corner suite- as they had no record of our upgrade- and it was ok, but not the cleanest. I will warn you, none of the rooms about a King room have enough storage! We peeked into one that was being cleaned and saw a dresser, which is missing in the corner suites. The upgraded rooms did not have any drawers - just a tiny closet. We lived out of our suitcases. They moved us a to a one bedroom suite the next evening- with TWO bathrooms- but again, no storage! We had suitcases all over the living room. The old room and new room had very clean tubs but they are not jacuzzi, they are soaking tubs. Still nice to have! I am not sure I would upgrade again... I feel like I would have preferred more storage to more space. We only went to the hotel to shower and sleep.The cleaning people did a great job each day!
There is a nespresso in the room, it is a great pick me up each day. They provide waters but the fridge is not really on. Weirdest thing about Dublin is that finding a cold bottled still water is difficult. Everything is room temp. 
Remember when you travel to check the sunrise & set. Since there is so much sun in July, the suites were hot from the all day sun from 4am-10PM. Tough to get cool enough when there is a heat wave - rare, but happened during our stay. Also, to sleep you have to pull the drapes as that sun comes up at like 4. 

Location:  This hotel is a 20 minute walk to Temple bar area, 30 min walk to Jameson & Guiness, etc. We walked about 8 miles a day to get to Temple Bar area and walk around and get back to the hotel. Uber is a cab that takes credit cards but is super easy to use as many cabs do not take cards! I thought the Temple bar was a single bar, but in reality it is a large area of lots of restaurants, pubs, live music, and was really fun. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance from the Marker. It was a quiet location and most of the people in that area are working professionals (Google & Facebook are nearby). At night walking back it was very long and very quiet and no cabs came by so if you decide to walk back- commit- and do not do it alone. Was a little shady with some shady characters out at night in that area. It does not get dark until 10-11PM which was really cool. 

Staff: the staff worked quickly to rectify our situation with the room. They were all friendly, especially the valet & concierge. Front desk was hit or miss - but they call the manager on duty if you need him really quickly. The valet area awesome at hailing cabs and getting one that fits your golf equipment or takes credit cards- whatever you need. 

Overall- great place to rest up, a little far from the fun stuff, but plenty to do if you do not mind ubering or taking those on off busses. Tons of construction in area but as one guy said- we are building our future!",4,2018,07,22
206,Superb again,"We were returning guests, this time with family and were delighted to be welcomed with wine and a beautifully presented dessert platter in our corner suite.  This hotel cannot be faulted.  Every single member of staff gives superb service.  Spa amazing, rooftop terrace and cocktails fab, evening meal top class, breakfast top notch.  Cleanliness of room fantastic.  This hotel is worth every penny.  Will definitely return.  Thank you Marker Hotel.",5,2018,07,21
206,Five-Star Hotel,This is a five-star property that makes you feel like you are staying at one. Everything is absolutely first class in every respect. The rooms are relatively spacious with all the amenities you would want. The only possible negative is that it is not near any of the major Dublin attractions (a 20+ minute walk) but if you don't mind that it's a great choice.,5,2018,07,20
206,A delight,Great service with most staff really attentive and referencing us by name. Went above and beyond to find us a place on the roof  bar out of the rain. Concierge very helpful when I had a shopping bag with a broken bottle. ,5,2018,07,18
206,Short breat in Dublin,"Lovely hotel, Godfrey was fantastic member of staff and extremely helpful.  Rooftop bar was nice, drinks especially grey goose expensive....  Gets very busy at weekends.  Could do with being open through the day.",5,2018,07,18
206,Dublin2018,"A busy hotel, great for work and  next to the theatre. Nice roof top bar but a little out of the way.  Did not feel luxurious ! We where unable to stay in the room booked and had to move. This was a special occasion and did not meet our expectations.",2,2018,07,18
206,Excellent in every way,"My wife and I arrived at the Marker on a sunny Saturday morning and were checked in by a very polite young lady. Our car was valet parked for us and we were shown to a lovely executive king room. The Nespresso machine was a lovely touch and the room was perfectly prepared in every way. 
We spent some time strolling around the area and that evening attended a family birthday party on the roof top bar which still remains one of Dublin's best bars. Standards of service were excellent and we were incredibly well taken care of for our entire stay. The breakfast buffet the next morning was fabulous. ",5,2018,07,17
206,business trip,"it was great - and I would stay again and again at this hotel - at any time! the location, the view, the atmosphere - it was just great! thanks very much! 
but thiese 200 characters are just stupid!...",5,2018,07,17
206,Ideal dock location hotel,"A very neat, clean, modern hotel. Located in Dublin's rejuvenated docks area. Easy walks into town with views up and down the Liffey. All the staff I encountered were wonderfully polite and helpful. The room is spacious and very comfortable. Huge bed. Slept like a baby - no city noise. ",5,2018,07,17
206,Lovely Dublin,"It was my first time in Dublin: the hotel is modern, nice, clean, in a perfect position. Very good the food (breakfast, bar, rooftop). The concierge very helpful and printed my boarding card, booked me a taxi... everything was perfect",5,2018,07,17
206,Greatest Hotel in Dublin,"I highly recommend this great Hotel
Greatest Hotel in Dublin
I rented a nice corner suite very comfortable and very clean
Everything was available in the room
The staff of the hotel is so kind and very professional
We spent a pleasant stay in this great hotel with my girlfriend
So nice souvenir of Dublin
",5,2018,07,16
206,"Zero Atmosphere, Underwhelming.","The building is beautiful and situated in a great location. However, the bar has no music or atmosphere whatsoever, even some nice classical musical playing in the background would have changed the ambience. 

The service was great, the food was average and it was a pretty boring experience overall (I have never said that about anywhere else I have ever reviewed).  I love class, beautiful surroundings - but this feels cold and that reminds me, it was literally cold and we had to be moved as the ‚Äúsmokers door‚Äù kept being left open and it was letting a draft in. 

Staff very accommodating and I can‚Äôt fault them at all, there is just something missing from this beautiful place.",3,2018,07,15
206,Rooftop Bar,"My Fiance and I approached the Marker Hotel about organising a small Engagement party on their beautiful rooftop bar. In typial fashion we left things a little last minute, however the team at the Marker Hotel turned the whole thing around for us so fast it was amazing! 
Right from the start Lee and Chef Gar Mullins made us feel like our party was the most important event to ever happen in the hotel. We were treated like royalty from check in with a lovely gift awaiting us in our room. The evening itself ran as smootly as possibe with the rooftop staff constantly on hand with welcoming drinks and food and to ensure everyone felt comfortable and happy.
The rooftop bar didn't let us down and we had the most amazing and memorable night. We highly recommend it and look forward to visiting again soon. 
Adrienne and John",5,2018,07,15
206,One of the best hotels,"The Marker Hotel is truly amazing I was advised it was a good hotel and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. From arrival to leaving this was a truly exceptional hotel with fantastic staff.

Of particular mention have to be Karmella and Kristina in the restaurant who was kind, caring and provided truly amazing service.

The hotel to clean, well appointed with excellent furniture and fittings,  very large comfortable beds and first class products in the bathrooms.

The rooftop bar provides great views over the city, whilst expensive the hotel was worth every penny..",5,2018,07,15
206,Nice stay,Always a very friendly welcome. Helpful staff. Clean and nice rooms. Locstion was fine for business meeting but slso a short walk to centre of Dublin.  Been here before and everything was just as expected.,5,2018,07,14
206,One of the best hotels I've stayed in,"The Marker is truly an exceptional hotel. The room was outstanding, the bathroom was spacious and well maintained. The bed and furniture were quite comfortable. The WiFi speeds were fast, and quite fast for most European hotels. The staff really made the stay quite pleasant, very warm and helpful.",5,2018,07,13
206,Purrrfect!!,WOW.!!  .. My husband is not easily impressed... but he used almost every superlative to describe his experience at this hotel!! Unfortunately or fortunately.... this was our first stopover in Ireland and presented a high bar for other accommodation to live up to.... The Spa & Indoor Pool area... Awesome!!!  The divine decor of our room.... Fabulous!!  The rooftop bar & dining area..... Amazing!!  Thank You Thank You....!!,5,2018,07,13
206,Superb from Start to Finish,"The Marker Hotel was superb from start to finish. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful from reception to waitstaff to housekeeping to concierge. They make you feel valued, appreciated and at home. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are tasteful, clean and spacious. I personally cannot day enough good things about The Marker Hotel. ",5,2018,07,12
206,Dublin's best stay!,"We found the Marker Hotel via a travel site and booked via AMEX. They offered a room upgrade, free breakfast, and a hotel credit during our three day stay. The hotel was recently built, very modern and included several conveniences for American Travelers (USB charging, 1 @ US plug, iron/board, hair dryer). Food was excellent at breakfast and my wife said the fish and chips were the best. We did not get to experience the rooftop bar or spa but I would bet they're top notch too. Highly recommend this hotel in Dublin.",5,2018,07,11
206,Pristine Clean Hotel,"Arrived for a two night stay with friends.  We were greeted by the doorman and guided to the reception.  Very friendly welcoming staff who explained everything perfectly.  Went up to our room on floor two....wow....what a spacious room with a huge bed, the bathroom was incredible, marble floors underfloor heating walk in shower and huge bath.  The breakfast room in the morning was lovely and the staff were so pleasant and attentive, they couldn't do enough for you. The Roof top Bar is a must especially on a beautiful sunny day, be aware though that you are better of booking as it obviously has maximum numbers. The Hotel is in walking distance to the main areas, Temple Bar and Grafton steet....about 15 mins.",5,2018,07,10
206,Stands out from the crowd......,"Having booked a weekend break with my wife and friends, from the moment we arrived at The Marker to leaving, our every need was attended to by an exceptional staff, who couldn't do enough for us. It really is another world experience, every other hotelier in the country should take the time to stay and study how its done..... Well done Charlie and the team ",5,2018,07,10
206,"Nice, new hotel. A little out of the way.","This is a nice, new hotel in an up-and-coming part of Dublin. It is a bit of a walk to the major sights, and I generally like to be more centrally located when on vacation. The room was large and comfortable, service was good, and overall we enjoyed our stay. ",4,2018,07,09
206,Wonderful Hotel!,"WOW, this hotel was impressive. I travel a ton for work so I stay at many hotels all year. This stay was for vacation and I had a wonderful experience. From the moment we were greeted upon arrival to the ease of check-in everything was perfect. It was my birthday and they sent up a complimentary glass of champagne. Gabriel who checked us in was so lovely and had great customer service skills! We visited the rooftop bar for a drink which had amazing views. The rooms were modern decor, Nespresso machines and most importantly was extremely clean. We stayed over near Temple Bar at the beginning of our trip but preferred this area for the end of our trip. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2018,07,09
206,A+ Dublin Hotel,"The hotel: This was my second time visiting Dublin and I really enjoyed the Docklands part of this region. It seems very up and coming. Upon arriving you'll most notice the checkerboard design. The bell staff were phenomenal, always opening doors and greeting each guest. While the front-desk staff could not accommodate my early check-in with a room, they were nice enough to allow me to freshen up in their spa. This was greatly appreciated after a long flight. The ground level has some beautiful seating areas, a restaurant, bar, spa, and exercise area. The guest room was impeccably clean. Beds were neatly made and carpets vacuumed. My only two issues with the room were the cool air was hard to control and the coffee machine was louder than usual. I also requested a few more toiletries for the room, but housekeeping was not very liberal with that request hah.

The spa: If you stay at this hotel, the spa is a must! Great bath products and again very clean. The staff were very friendly and professional. I had the opportunity to book a massage and while it was somewhat pricey, I couldn't ask for a better massage. The massage never felt rushed and every so often I was asked if the pressure applied was fine or if I'm ok.

The rooftop: Also a must if you're visiting during a warmer day. Drinks on average are around 15 euros and are crafted very well. The views are beautiful from here.

The area: This hotel is located directly across the street from the Bord G√°is Energy Theatre. It also is around the corner from Facebook's Dublin office. The river is close by if you decide to take a stroll. Venturing around the immediate area at night solo can make one feel a little uneasy, but I didn't have any issues. The hotel is about a 25 minute walk to Temple Bar and O'Connell Street. Taxis are plentiful.

Summary:
+ Modern design
+ Good staff
+ Awesome spa and rooftop
- Can be pricey
- Not as close to main Dublin attractions",4,2018,07,09
206,5 Star Service,"Visited the Marker hotel a few weeks ago for one night. We were immediately greeted by extremely helpful reception staff who checked us in quickly. 
Our room was very nice, very comfortable bed and had a nice view of Grand Canal Square. The rooms had robes, slippers and a safe. The only downfall (which is very small - but something you would expect in a 5star) is that there was only one small shampoo, one small conditioner and one small shower wash. This was not enough for two people however we made do. I forgot a comb and phoned reception to see if they had spare disposable combs but they didn‚Äôt and informed me there is a spar down the road! 

We ate in the bar, steak and curry and it was gorgeous. By far one of the nicest steaks I had in a long time. Must mention Joannis who was extremely helpful to us and is an asset to the hotel! 
The rooftop bar is out of this world, we had a bit of a wait as it was so busy but was worth it. 

So overall it was a lovely night, really friendly staff and a gorgeous location. Food and service was amazing. It‚Äôs definitely on the expensive side but nice for a treat or special occasion. ",5,2018,07,07
206,Fantastic,"We got of the dublin coach and didn't have a clue how to get to the hotel. I was told it's only a 10 min walk from where the bus leaves you of. We walked a good 45 mins to an hour to find the hotel lol. When we got there we where greated by friendly staff. The room was amazing every thing you need. Mini bar and snacks you do pay for. The bed is super big and so comfortable. The bathroom is great all marble. Spotlessly clean. 

I highly recommend this hotel oh and breakfast is beautiful not only can you get so much food that is sitting there on offer hot and cold but you can order from the kitchen as well. 

I was on the 5th floor with a great view. Also there is shops handy.

O'connal street is a good half hour walk. You can hire bikes but we decided to walk take in the views along the way 

You have to go. I want to go back it was amazing they have roof top bar as well I didn't make it up there but maybe next time üòä",5,2018,07,05
206,First impressions count.,"My friend & I booked three rooms for a treat for ourselves and the kids. We usually stay at The Spencer or Hilton Kilmanham, both excellent 4 star hotels. This time we wanted to experience the 5 star treatment Dublin had to offer. My friend and family arrived ahead of myself and young son. two rooms for 4 of our party were ready and she paid for them in cash, over ‚Ç¨600. She was then asked for photographic ID as she did not have a credit card and the debit card she used to book the room was unacceptable for some reason.No one in our party had any photographic ID as we only travelled by train from Co Down, the 2 student ID cards our girls had did not qualify as photographic ID. We were baffled and by this stage very annoyed. No explaination was forthcoming as to why we needed phographic ID or why a debit card was not acceptable. We did ask to speak to the manager but they didn't appear. The receptionist informed us that we would have to pay an extra ‚Ç¨25 each, this ‚Ç¨150 we would get back at the end of our stay. So I put the ‚Ç¨350 for my room plus the ‚Ç¨150 on my credit card. I had to pay this extra fee also (‚Ç¨50) even though I used my credit card, doesn't add up. At no time were we offered an explanation, we were not offered help with our bags and did not get directions to our rooms. Only for a nice gent called Fernando who found us wandering around and escorted us to the lifts, we may never have been found again. This really was very bad service and we were super annoyed.
On a positive note, The Marker is a lovely modern hotel in a lovely relaxing area. It was meticulously clean and I loved the dark interior of the hallways. The bathroom was really very nice, large with a great shower and deep bath. AIR CON was a life saver in a beautiful but very hot Dublin, that, coupled with great sound proofing gave me the best nights sleep I have had in some time.
The best bit was the Spa and pool, very, very nice. Excellent staff.
Breakfast was a bit of a dolly mixture. The buffet breakfast was just ok, the croissant were not very good, Hilton Kilmanham have lovely fluffy buttery full size croisants and proper pastries. Yours were Premier Inn standard. Inital service was good, coffee and orange juice promtly served and then no one for a good 20 minutes to take my order from the menu. When it did arrive it was excellent. First time staying at a 5 star hotel and the smoked salmon & eggs benidict had an extra supplement, the steak I can understand. 
I loved The Marker and the spa was fab but our stay was marred by our inital contact with your front of house. We didn't get our 5 star treatment. First impressions count.",2,2018,07,05
206,A great hotel with fantastic staff,"I stayed at the Marker with my mum and we both loved it. The bedroom was so nice and the bed was excellent. Lovely bath salts and hand cream. I especially liked the Dental kit as id forgotten my toothpaste!
Would thoroughly recommend The Marker",5,2018,07,04
206,A little off the mark,"Been to Dublin 3 times, two times at the Westin and my last trip was here. I wanted to try something different, but it was a little off the Mark. Maybe three years from now it will be more vibrant, but the area was a bit dead but for a few restaurants. I much prefer the hip scene of temple bar of fade street. The westin or the westbury are better high end hotels in better central locations. Additionally, the hotel was so dark. Dark hallways, deep purple carpet and black marble tile in bathrooms are just not my thing. I prefer the class and tradition and friendliness of the other high end hotels. The door man who worked the rooftop bar was such a snob and told me I couldn‚Äôt go up to the rooftop bar because there was a private party starting on 30 min. I told him my husband and daughter were up there. He told me I was mistaken and was only for hotel guests from 5-7 and everyone was down and i could not go up. I reminded him I was a hotel guest and it was only 630, he said well doesn‚Äôt matter no one can go up. Well I tried for 30 minutes to track my family down and sure enough they were on the roof top bar. Bad form mr. doorman. ",2,2018,07,04
206,Incredible,"This hotel is top notch. Every staff member I interacted with was very courteous and accommodating. When we first arrived my wife was feeing under the weather and they were quickly able to check us in early and immediately sent up hot tea for her. Incredible service and great amenities. 

The hotel is located in a great area and steps away from the Liffey River as well as the Hop On Hop a Off Dublin bus. I would definitely recommend this hotel to all visitors.  ",5,2018,07,04
206,Flawless.,"Kudos to the management team at this hotel for their superb training of the staff. Everyone, from the doormen, to the reception, to the people who service the room, were pleasant and professional. The wait staff at breakfast in the mornings deserve a special recognition. The king size bedroom was more than spacious and the bathroom gorgeous and huge. The hotel's location is ideal if you don't want to be right in the noisy Temple Bar area, but close enough to walk there. We've been to many hotels around the world, and this one is up there with the very best. A true pleasure to stay there. ",5,2018,07,03
206,"Outstanding Hotel, Amazing Vibe","We stayed at The Marker for 2 Nights over the weekend. The Hotel is impeccable. From Check in to Check Out the service was First Class....We are in the Hotel both Nights. Firstly in the Brasserie and Second in the Bar. The Food was Faultless.
We had drinks on the Roof Terrace Both Nights, the Cocktails were lovely, and the views and overall vibe up there was beautiful.
We loved the Chilled Music throughout the Hotel, and the Spa was so good, we even had it to ourselves at one point.
Cant wait to return soon. Thankyou @TheMarker for
the ultimate in Weekend Luxury.

206,Not quite hitting the Mark,Front of house excellent but behind the scenes the experience was let down by a broken tap and dirty toilet. Some problems with the quality of draft drinks served in the Bar but the breakfast and staff could not have been better. I would love to have given five stars as I have admired this hotel for a long time.,3,2018,07,03
206,"Perfect, Perfect, Perfect","This was probably one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. Their customer service is superb! Everyone at the front desk,spa, door, bar, room service, etc were wonderful. They were so prompt to fulfill all of my inquiries (and I had a lot). The rooms are gorgeous and huge! They provide non-toxic toiletries which is a huge plus. They have a yummy nespresso machine in the room and there are little creamers in the mini-fridge. There is a lot of natural light and a full length mirror to get ready. The beds are super comfy- they even have a little table card giving you the option to request other types of pillows (down, memory foam, etc). 

 I felt very safe in the hotel. Everyone was so helpful and really strived to give great service. I could not recommend this hotel enough! ",5,2018,07,02
206,Great hotel in central Dublin,"The Marker is a modern hotel reflecting Dublin's resurgence as a hip, young European capital. The hotel is located on the Grand Canal near much of the tech offices in Dublin (Facebook, Ancestry.com, etc.). For those who don't mind a short walk, you can walk fairly easily to most locations in central Dublin. While the hotel is lacking in charm, the staff are friendly and helpful. No issues at all. The rooms are clean and nice, although nothing particularly memorable or charming. The bed was comfortable, bathroom functional, little to no noise from the hallway or other rooms. The hotel has a fairly up-to-date gym. Our rate included breakfast in Brasserie in the hotel, and it is a nice buffet with many hot and cold choices. The wait staff at breakfast were generally very nice and helpful with coffee, tea, toast.",5,2018,07,02
206,Nice Stay at Marker,"Really nice hotel 20 mins walk form Grafton St. Very busy spot.
Modern rooms and great roof top bar. Plenty of selection for breakfast.

206,Excellent Hotel,We will be back! Seemless & fantastic stay at The Marker Hotel. Nothing was too much trouble. Excellent location and you could easily walk into the City centre. Really enjoyed our stay at this fashionable City Hotel! Only downfall (but not really one!) Not enough art!!!!,5,2018,07,01
206,Shut out from the roof top bar,"The hotel had a private event on the roof top bar and didn‚Äôt allow guests up there at all. A major attraction to this hotel is the bar and yet it‚Äôs paying guests are not permitted up there even on a limited basis. When I was there it was the hottest day Dublin has experienced in 46 years and the staff turned us away from going up there. To top it off, the hotel staff didn‚Äôt even offer complementary drinks at the lobby bar for the inconvenience they placed on their paying guests.  Just imagine if the spa was taken for a private event! Why should the guests be turned away and suffer. ",4,2018,07,01
206,Interesting Ultra Modern Concepts,"This hotel has a youthful modern ambiance.  Overall, my guest room was exceptional with a bathroom that was spacious and spotless.  The service in the restaurant/bar area was professional and efficient.  The cucumber martini was superb!  I was sorry to learn the rooftop bar was closed for a private function.  Since this particular bar is such a drawing card for the hotel, I would hope that there could be some type of limitation on private affairs.  The hotel hallways are spacious.  However, that being said, the ultra dark chocolate brown color is depressing.  Good breakfast buffet.  Great location.",5,2018,06,30
206,Excellent Hotel,"If you want a hotel that is welcoming, beautifully finished in the smartest part of Dublin then look no further! The Marker looks and feels opulent and has a range of Superb food and leisure facilities too!
The rooftop bar is a must for fantastic views across the city.",5,2018,06,29
206,Great hotel great location,"I stayed here for work for one night in June. It was a lovely stay - friendly staff, clean facilities, good breakfast spread, good room service choice (as I arrived quite late and needed dinner).

The rooms was very very spacious with lots of amenities, like an iron, mini bar, all the usual appliances.

Only need more plug sockets!

206,Amazing Customer Service!,"Our stay at The Marker Hotel in Dublin was fantastic.  It was our first time in Dublin and we are so thankful that we chose this hotel for our stay.  All of the staff we encountered were first rate, the rooms were great, and it was a wonderful location.  We will definitely stay here when we visit again!",5,2018,06,27
206,Concert weekend in Dublin,Stayed the weekend as part of a tour through Ireland and a concert weekend in Dublin. Good up and coming location in Dublin. Just close enough to walk into the city but avoid the noise and hustle of the night time economy. ,4,2018,06,27
206,"Best Service, Great Rooftop Deck","We loved the Marker Hotel for our June stay there, walking distance to everything, the best service ever (thank you Fernando), nice rooms, but rooms a bit smallish, and the shower spray/head wasn't the best.  Otherwise, I would give it 5 stars.",4,2018,06,26
206,great location if your conference is in the theatre next door!,"big bathrooms, restaurants nearby (but not loud at night), conveniently located. breakfast that comes with the stay is a full Irish breakfast spread with fresh fruits, pastries and cheeses.  roof top has a great view on a nice day in Dublin... ",4,2018,06,26
206,Excellent Dublin Stay,"Cannot say enough things about this wonderful Dublin hotel.  The location in the more modern side of Dublin is great and conveniently close to major attractions (the National Gallery and Trinity College are only a 15 minute walk away).  The hotel itself is modern and lovely, with large, clean, comfortable rooms.  They have a great on-site restaurant and the rooftop bar is a hit on a beautiful evening like the one we experienced during our stay.  The staff, as in most of Ireland, is welcoming and helpful.  The hotel is also extremely accommodating to kids.  Our ",5,2018,06,26
206,Amazing time,"Had a fantastic one night trip to Dublin at the Marker. Friendly staff beautiful room great food,  Great location as well in close proximity to the city center but far enough from the hustle and bustle of the crowd. search no where else. ",5,2018,06,25
206,Overpriced and underwhelmed,"Had heard good reviews of this place and the was expecting to be blown away. Unfortunately, it never happened.
Ok, it's not all bad. Very attentive valet parking. I hadn't even stopped and they were on hand to take my luggage and park my car. Secondly, the reception staff were helpful and very engaging. So far so good. Unfortunately, that's where it stops. A hotel that calls itself 5 star lost it all once you walk away from reception. Rooms are no better than a three star hotel. I don't want to come across as snobbish but if you are staying at a 5 star hotel, the room needs to blow you away. The best part of the room was the bathroom; shower and bath in what was a pretty spacious bathroom. The rest was meh. Furniture and finish in the rooms was similar to that of homes built in the room. Definitely rushed job.

So, one of its selling points is the roof top bar. There is a member of staff in the lobby to direct you to where the access is for the roof top bar. At the access, there is another member of staff to ""greet"" you and communicate with their counterpart up at the bar to see if there is room. So we waited for a few minutes at the access point, nobody presented themselves at the point. Two separate groups of people came down from the roof bar via the elevator. So after waiting and not being attended I pressed the button to call the lift again. An elderly man, dressed in a suit approached us and said come back over here and I talk to ya for a minute(5‚òÜ service), no excuse me or I beg your pardon...Just general down talking to us. After a few moments and once his security checks were done we were allowed access to the roof bar and to be honest it sure wasn't worth it. On one side you look down onto the grand canal dock and building sites and from the other side you could see the convention centre and more building sites. 

I could go on but why bother. All in all a very unimpressive hotel. Some members of staff make it but it is a hotel that has if not one, definitely 2 stars too many after it's name",1,2018,06,25
206,Weekend visit,"Lovely hotel. Nice room, spacious and good bathroom with shower and bath. Had dinner in restaurant Friday night...food not particularly exciting but pleasant. Lee, our waiter, was excellent. Good breakfast buffet. Couldn‚Äôt get a treatment in the spa as it was booked out but really enjoyed the pool. I would stay again.",5,2018,06,24
206,Excellent Accommodations,Excellent service with very friendly staff. The hotel is beautiful and centrally located. Rooftop restaurant with beautiful view. Our room with plenty of space and well equipped.  Would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends and family.,5,2018,06,24
206,Great Hotel,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Marker.  The room was spacious and the bathroom had a great tub and an awesome shower with heated flooring. 

The only complaint about the room would be that the early morning sun came through our windows even though there were blackout curtains.  It seeped in above the rod.  But we had early morning activities so it really didn't matter.

The restaurant had an excellent hot and cold buffet and the staff was very attentive.  It is really a business hotel during the week and quite busy.  But felt very cared you despite the crowds.

The hotel is situated about a 30 minute walk from Grafton Street and Trinity College and only a few steps from Facebook.  I felt it was a great location and we enjoyed the walk into the center of the city.",5,2018,06,24
206,They made mistakes but had excellent service recovery,"This hotel is a little out of the way in Dublin, but was a delight. Our room was not available when we arrived due to a ""glich."" They went out of their way to make things right. They offered free drinks or free breakfast.  When the air conditioning in the room wasn't functioning they immediately moved us to another room and put a fruit basket in it. They didn't make excuses. They took care of the problems immediately, which is all one can ask for. The room was beautiful and they have a spa and pool with an exercise facility which we enjoyed. The tall ships were visiting for the bank holiday while we were there and the atmosphere was festive.",5,2018,06,22
206,Pretty good although expected amazing for the price,"I stayed for 7 nights for a conference in town. Reception staff varied from being friendly and helpful to somewhat indifferent and apathetic. Room was excellent in size, cleanliness and design. Breakfast was good, although the spread was the same for the entire duration of my stay...a little variation in the buffet or a la carte menu would be nice. Brasserie staff extremely friendly. Location is great if you want to be close to the convention centre, otherwise, this is about 20-25 minutes walk into the centre of Dublin.",4,2018,06,20
206,Wonderful Stay,"Not knowing much about Dublin, I was concerned that the location would be a bit out of the way.  I was wrong.  The hotel is close to a hop on/hop off bus stop (maybe a bit cheesy but great way to get the lay of the land) and easily walking distance to many of the sites we wanted to visit.  

The service was wonderfully attentive and the rooms were very clean/comfortable.  I was especially impressed with the bathrooms.  So often the room will be lovely but the bathroom will be tiny.  Not here.  The huge, deep tub was a joy after a long red eye flight or a day of sight seeing.  

If I had a criticism it would be breakfast.  While the buffet was comprehensive, I think it was a bit expensive and service was inconsistent. Some mornings I had difficulty getting a cup of coffee.  I think it was due to the fact that some guests pre-booked the breakfast buffet and others were ordering from a menu, leaving the serving staff a bit confused.  All told, though, I'd probably book the buffet again because of convenience, as there aren't many breakfast spot in the immediate neighborhood.    

I've already mentioned this hotel to a few folks planning trips to Dublin and would happily  book here again.",5,2018,06,19
206,Great weekend,"We stayed there for three days. We had a great room and we were amazed by the room, a great view and luxerous. The breakfast buffet could be a little bit more, but the breakfast menu had a lot of choice. The employees where very friendly and helpfull when needit. Even at 3 o'clock in the morning, to bring tea for my sick boyfriend. ",4,2018,06,19
206,Highly Recommended,"Service is always top notch - the staff make you feel really welcome and special.
Food is lovely and it's a great location - always a pleasure to stay there. Valet parking and a lovely pool - bedrooms are always clean and spacious",5,2018,06,19

206,Very nice hotel with great service,"The Marker is very nice, modern and the service is excellent and friendly.  Shout out to Vladimir,  the concierge,  for his incredible service.  The rooms are spacious and well appointed.  The hallways are too dark though! Food at the Brasserie is excellent,,  not so much at the Marker Bar (I had an overcooked burger that arrived late and was flavorless), but my husband's chowder was very good). Hotel location is great for business,  so-so for touring Dublin (we were there for both).",5,2018,06,16
206,My new hotel in Dublin - It‚Äôs perfect,"Everything was perfect, the staff were really really nice. The room was modern, well kept, comfortable and high quality. Breakfast buffet was excellent, we went to the spa and pool. Really nice facilities, gym is good too. Close to the centre of town and a real gem of a hotel. What hotels should be. ",5,2018,06,15

206,Great Hotel service was fantastic.,Stayed for a couple of days service was spot on. Breakfast was especially good.Heated floors in Bath was also a plus.Indoor pool was wonderful.Location was good being within walking distance to city center but not overly crowded.

206,Great Hotel Away From City Center,"May be it is a 8 euro taxi ride to City Shopping concentration, but this is worth of it.

Thank you.",5,2018,06,10
206,Excellent hotel and staff,"We recently stayed at the Marker with our family of 5 in two separate rooms. The hotel is very luxurious, with clean, modern, comfortable rooms, and very professional and courteous staff. The location is great if you have meetings in the financial district, are going to a show at the theater next door, or simply want to relax/spa out of the hustle and bustle of the city, but it‚Äôs not really in the center of Dublin action. It‚Äôs a 20-25 minute walk to Grafton Street, for example. For us, with 3 teenage girls, it was a little out of the way of the activities they like (i.e. shopping and eating), but it is an excellent hotel nonetheless. ",5,2018,06,09
206,‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,"We stayed here for a night as we were going to see Michael McIntyre. This hotel is one of the best I've stayed in and this is because of the staff. Every little detail makes a difference to your stay and it's rare to find this customer service in a hotel. The doorman greeted us and directed us to reception and this instantly put us at ease. Another member of staff showed us to our room and went through everything in detail. This was very impressive. The check in staff were very professional and polite. We were delighted with our room, very clean and luxurious. The bathroom had underfloor heating which was really nice. The hotel has so much to offer we can't wait to come back and stay again! Thanks to all the staff at the marker üòä",5,2018,06,09
206,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for a few nights after my wedding and it was lovely and new.  I would have given the hotel 5 stars however they overcharged my husband and I by 1,000 euros but eventually refunded the amount back once I managed to prove they had guaranteed our room rates in an email.  The rooftop bar is lovely and worth visiting.",4,2018,06,07
206,Modern and elegant hotel,"My husband and I celebrated our 50th anniversary with a 6night stay at the Marker Hotel.  The rooms are large, clean and beautifully decorated.  A heated bathroom floor was an unexpected pleasure.  The hotel is located in the Grand Canal section of Dublin,close to the international offices of Facebook and google.  The on-off bus stop is close by and taxis are readily available. The consierge was most helpful in booking visits to several historic sites.  On the roof is a fabulous bar with great views.  The manager of the bar was most helpful and took good care of us during our visit to the roof.  The hotel rates 5 stars and deserves everyone.  I think most guests are in Dublin on business but the staff took good care of our tourist needs.  Our room had a wonderful view of the canal and while we were there, a regatta of tall ships were docked in the canal. What a treat.  I wouldn't change a thing about our stay. Excellent!.",5,2018,06,06
206,AMAZING from start to finish üòä,Such a fab night away in the marker hotel gorgeous food ..highly recommend the sea food chowder and prawn linguine .amazing setting .Thoroughly enjoyed the roof top bar and as for the spa it was truly tranquil.Cannot wait to return,5,2018,06,06
206,Five Stars,"Great location away from the crowds of Temple Bar , but still within walking distance. Five star all the way, you have to try the rooftop bar great views and drinks but dress warm . Service for breakfast was a little slow but delicious ",5,2018,06,06
206,Heaven,"went to the  Theatre, stayed in the Marker , what can I say, is that looking forward to
staying again , cannot fault it in anyway, From start, dropping off my car to having it dropped outside the hotel when leaving, pure class all the way",5,2018,06,05
206,"The Marker Hotel is in the Docklands area of Dublin, home to a lot of international tech companies","I loved the Marker as it combined all the creature comforts of an upscale, big city hotel but was a boutique establishment with friendliness and great access to all of Dublin.  The from door opens onto the Grand Canal Square.  There was a lot of ""buzz"" at lunchtime as all of the workers at the tech offices came outside for lunch and enjoyed the good amount of public space.  We had a corner room on the top floor with a 180 degree view.  The only crazy thing was that taxis were scarce and Ubers were even more scarce.  Book a car ahead of time.",5,2018,06,02
206,"Great Hotel, great location","Really good facilities, rooms are very comfortable (esp. the bathroom was amazing). The location is also very handy. Very friendly staff and also although I haven't used it myself, I've heard the rooftop is very good.",5,2018,06,02
206,Rooftop bar - fantastic views and a great atmos,"If you like a bar with a great Vista this is the place to come - sandwiched in between the River Liffey and the Grand Canal. You have good views of the Dublin or Wicklow Mountains, the Aviva Stadium, the barges on the Grand Canal. In the distance you can see Dun Laoghaire and the magnificent Dublin Bay. 
The bar has a good atmosphere and would be great for a date night. the staff are friendly and accommodating, blankets are provided should it become a bit nippy! A place I would definitely return. As I write this a group of men have just broke out singing in Acapella such is the place - you could almost say very evocatively. ",5,2018,06,01
206,"Terrific staff, good room",The Marker is a modern hotel on Canal Square. It is really well situated for the convention centre and there are quite a few reasonable restaurants nearby though it is a bit of a hike to the old city centre where most of the shops and pubs are. The staff are outstanding and helpful. Absolutely delightful. It has a really excellent pool - big enough for laps at 23 m at the perfect temperature. I would strongly recommend it.,5,2018,06,01
206,Top Marks for Marker,"Great Hotel professional and very attentive to every need , the Concierges are brilliant along with reception desk and Bar staff very efficient overall when in Dublin we would book again great Canal view as well from our Room ",5,2018,05,31
206,Amazing Hotel,"I never write reviews. This is an AMAZING hotel. Stayed last Saturday in May. It's a toss up between the Marker and the Westbury (also Dublin) which I've also stayed at as the best hotel I've ever experienced. The Marker definitely edges it. From when we arrived to when we left the service was quite frankly amazing. My GF said she wanted sushi to eat something different, the receptionist (red haired girl glasses) insisted she would look for a local restaurant and spent five minutes searching for local sushi restaurants for us. Couldn't be more helpful. I love modern minimal design and this hotel oozes modernism, class and elegance and is matched by exceptional, meticulous service by staff. I needed to polish my boots before I went out for the night, (scuffed to bits) I had asked would they leave cleaning materials up as er, I feel funny asking anyone to polish my boots. A phone call came back - reception insisted they do it. A concierge came up with a specific Marker branded bag for shoes and they were done within minutes. Room was fantastic and the marble bathroom is about the size of a small living room. The staff couldn't be more efficient, friendlier. Can't wait to get back. Also breakfast was again amazing with a huge selection of continental foods and cooked breakfast and even actual honeycomb if you wanted it. Plus I noticed some girls were in for breakfast at 10.30 a.m. and eating off the A La Carte menu - champagne with lobster and avocado...next time!",5,2018,05,30
206,beautiful hotel,"I travel a lot and this is the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in. Unfortunately I had the flu while there, but I would rather be sick at this hotel than at my own home. Upon check in, the front desk clerk noticed my cold/laryngitis and asked if I would like tea delivered to my room. Also:
1) the hotel is brand new and the rooms are extremely clea.
2) the bathroom is huge and the bed very comfortable
3) the spa is out of this world and saunas and steam rooms are complimentary to guests.
Blanca at reception was so helpful.
4) the staff is very accommodating without being intrusive. I have stayed at other five star hotels where they follow you around which I hate. 
5) A/C and heat systems are  perfect, probably because they are new.
It really does feel like you are being treated like royalty. I would come back to Dublin just to stay at this hotel. 
But if you do, go around the corner to great bakery Lolly and Cooks for breakfast. I didn't buy the breakfast included and the price at the hotel is just silly expensive",5,2018,05,30
206,top maarks for The Marker,"If you want to be treated like Royalty,  go no further than The Marker in Dublins Grand Canal Dock. Everything about this hotel is top notch, but the quality of service,  and the friendly and very professional staff, bring this hotel to a different level.",5,2018,05,29
206,Excellent and friendly staff.,"The staff went over the top accommodating us. When our flight was cancelled at 6 am in the morning the day we were on our way out the door, they immediately accommodated us with an additional day stay. My only disappointment is the ",5,2018,05,29
206,booking offers that aren't honored!!,"The hotel is very lovely but they don't honor offers they present on website! We booked directly with hotel and the pop up stated free breakfast for doing so. When we arrived they said it wasn't included ( and at over 25 euros a person we weren't eating there)!! We showed the staff a screen shot of the offer, but they still wouldn't honor it! We, more than likely would have still stayed there, but don't offer what you won't deliver!! A hotel with great customer service would realize a couple free breakfasts for people that could prove it was offered wouldn't hurt the bottom line for them-it's a buffet after all!!",2,2018,05,28
206,Amazing from start to finish!,"I booked this hotel as part of a surprise trip for my boyfriends 21st birthday. From the minute we arrived at the hotel we were so impressed. The lady that checked us in was very helpful and efficient. We arrived around 10am and check in to our room wasn't until 3pm. The hotel said they would ring us when our room was ready. We decided we would get the hop on and hop off bus by recommendation of the hotel, to the Guinness Storehouse for the day. We had only been on the bus for about 30 mins before my phone rang to let us know our room was ready and we just had to pick our keys up from reception when we were ready. Once we had finished at the Guinness Storehouse we got the hop on hop off bus back to the hotel. Our room was gorgeous, so spacious and very clean. Couldn't fault it at all! The staff bought my boyfriend a lovely dessert wishing him a happy birthday. This was a lovely touch and not expected, so thank you. We ate in the hotel a couple of times. Our favourite was the camembert off the bar menu! This was amazing! We went up to the rooftop bar for cocktails which I would definitely recommend. Staff so attentive and polite, bought over blankets if you were cold. Nothing was too much trouble! I cannot wait to return to Dublin and we will definitely be staying here again.
Thank you to all the staff at The Marker for our unforgettable trip :)",5,2018,05,26
206,The Only Place to Stay in Dublin,"I stayed at the Marker and the clontarf castle hotel last week in Dublin. I have to say a Wow to the Marker. It is definitely a world class, a real luxury hotel. Very clean and spacious room, very modern, all facilities are awesome, heated floor bathroom makes you feel in heaven, and for me the most important things are new and quiet. A good hotel is hard and easy. To meet all customers's needs is easy and hard. But Marker achieves it. The breakfast was great too. I was worried based on many reviews, but turned out to be very good quality and variety. Way way better than the clontarf castle hotel, which is too outdated (not clean enough, room smells) for me, but it may be a personel preferece. Location wise, Marker is a bit far from city centre, but i walk everyday along the river to get to city centre, no problem, and you won't feel it's a long walk. Very easy access to the city. Plus taxi is everywhere, easy to catch one. Dublin is a lovely city with rich culture, and Marker hotel makes my trip even better, really enjoyed my stay there, and want to say thank you to all the staff, they are all very friendly, and trying to take care of you in every way. Highly recommend this hotel to whoever wants to travel to Dublin. You will not regret and will regret staying at other places.",5,2018,05,25
206,Wow,A modern hotel in the centre city near the harbor with east access to regular buses and the on and off bus. Great rooms and showers. Lovely restaurant and bar. Great staff and porters. Easy to get a cab. 15 minutes from the airport via the tunnel. Downtown in a flash. The best hotel we stayed in during our 10 days in Ireland,5,2018,05,25
206,The Marker,"Lovely modern hotel with very friendly staff, I will definitely stay at The Marker again. Great location and beautiful at night time with all of the buildings lit up. The night time room service menu is a little limited but the breakfast more than makes up for it.",5,2018,05,24
206,Stylish hotel near the docks,"Elegant hotel. Excellent service. Excellent breakfast. Located a little away from the main sights, but within walking distance (about 15 minutes to Trinity). Tea and coffee making facilities in room much appreciated.",5,2018,05,24
206,Night at the spa!,"Nice room, could have had a better view but was lovely, great breakfast, the real honey comb is a lovely touch, stayed as part of the stay Sunday spa Monday package, the treatment was lovely the therapist was lovely and very knowledgeable, the spa facilities were lovely just a pool sauna and steam but all very nice, hotel gym could be better but was big enough for a proper workout, would definitely stay again",4,2018,05,23
206,World class hotel,Don‚Äôt think twice...just stay here...it‚Äôs away from the pub scene so it‚Äôs quiet but close to everything.  Worth every penny.  We came for tourism so it was perfect to sleep soundly but grab the tram or the hop on/hop off to see the sights!,5,2018,05,23
206,Great place to stay when you visit Dublin,"The staff at The Marker are outstanding. They were extremely helpful in all respects, especially in recommending excellent restaurants.  The rooms were clean and very nice.  The rooftop bar was also a great spot to relax.   We would definitely stay here again.",4,2018,05,23
206,"Great rooms, Poor food service","We stayed on vacation for 6 days.  The room, our was a deluxe twin, was great with an exceptional room cleaning staff.  The Brasserie service staff was terrible.  For the buffet breakfast, we waited for drinks and never got any refills.  We had to walk over to our server, who was chatting with other staff, to get our check.  The Marker bar was hit or miss on service.  We found out that it's best to ask for a drink and thereafter the server is more attentive.  The roof bar is great but they let the public access and guests just get priority access.  Go early or it's a long wait.  Views are definitely worth the ride (if the elevator is working).",3,2018,05,23
206,Not so relaxing maternity spa treatment,"Being 38 weeks pregnant, I was really looking forward to a top to toe maternity treatment in the spa as I had heard so many good things about it.  I was particularly looking forward to the facial part of the treatment as it is difficult to get one when pregnant (typically you need to be lying flat, which isn‚Äôt possible at 38 weeks)! The experience however wasn‚Äôt as comfortable as it could be and I ultimately had to stop the treatment twice to ask the therapist to put the bed in an upright position.  When she finally did, the treatment was great, just a pity the bed couldn‚Äôt have been upright all along (I asked from the very start but told it wasn‚Äôt possible so she placed pillows under me which didn‚Äôt do the job!). Spoke to the girls at the front desk afterwards and was given 20% off the price of the treatment.  Would ask that all maternity treatments are reviewed to ensure that they can be provided in a comfortable manner for the mum to be!",3,2018,05,22
206,Slightly Disappointing,"The staff at the hotel were lovely and our room was available when we arrived which is always nice. 
I had mentioned that it was sister's birthday and staff pointed out they were aware upon our arrival and a gesture was left in our room.
For a 5 star hotel - the lobby, lobby bar and breakfast area were not as grand as I have experienced in other 5 star hotels, in fact it was quite plain. 
Part of the breakfast area could be seen from the front door when anyone could be walking in to have a coffee or business meeting in the main bar/coffee area.

If your planning a stay in Dublin City Centre - please note a taxi from here is around 10 euro each way so going out in the day time and night time exploring will cost a small bit. ",4,2018,05,22
206,Amazing birthday weekend!,Treated like a VIP in the nicest but also most informal and relaxed atmosphere... amazing place... special memories... and lots of special touches organised by my fabulous partner with the hotel staff ... thanks ,5,2018,05,22
206,Amazing hotel with fabulous Staff,"Couldn‚Äôt fault this hotel, from start to finish amazing service. The rooms were spacious, clean and luxurious. The food and drink amazing and the staff couldn‚Äôt do enough to help you they were brilliant. ",5,2018,05,22
206,good stay,"Good hotel 
centre of IFSC 
close to major entertainment venues
access little awkward 
staff very friendly and helpful 
Rooms very clean and tidy 
minimal disruption as rooms well insulated 
I would stay here again ",4,2018,05,20
206,Truly Remarkable,"For me, the attention to details and cleanliness was what most notably set The Marker apart from other hotels. I would arrive daily to a very clean room, even my mobile charger's cable would be folded nicely, every single time without fail.

The rooms are spacious and the finishing of the rooms left little more to be desired. I would definitely visit again for business or pleasure.",5,2018,05,20
206,"Top class hotel, great location","Really enjoyed our stay in the Marker,
Great base for visiting the Bord G√°is Theater & the city. We visited on what was probably one of the five hot & sunny weekends in Ireland and had drinks on the roof top bar, great service and great to get another view point of the city. Rooms were immaculate. Only issues were at check-in some of the options (breakfast) was not included even though I had the email confirmation. This was easily sorted by front of house. Also the corner suite room was a twin bed which I wouldn't have booked so I went bay to front of house who moved our room to another suite, not as nice view but the hotel was busy so no major issue.

We had drinks in bar after the show, great table service very attentive and never had to wait on orders.
Breakfast was on par with everything else very good, only small issue I had was surcharge on eggs benedict (I know poached eggs are a pain to get perfect).
Over all, really enjoyed our stay and we will be back for a long weekend in the near future.
",5,2018,05,20
206,Great Surprise,We loved every part of the stay and this was our second time.  The facilities are beautiful an the staff well trained. The food was terrific and and the service great.  We will stay there again on our next trip. ,5,2018,05,16
206,Roof with a view,"It had been a long time since we‚Äôd visited Dublin & we decided to stay at The Marker based on tripadvisor etc. The location was great, well within strolling distance of the city centre sites but in a great place to explore the upcoming ‚Äòsilicon docks‚Äô.  Loved our corner room, great spacious bathroom. With the huge selection of places to eat in Dublin we didn‚Äôt eat in but breakfast was good, Bircher muesli off the menu was delicious. One of the big appeals was the rooftop bar which is the place to be seen in Dublin at the moment it seems. It is disappointing that residents aren‚Äôt guaranteed tables at busy times (it wasn‚Äôt surprising it was busy the weekend we were there as the weather was stunning) but with a little help from front desk, we had a lovely table for pre-dinner drinks on both nights we stayed.",5,2018,05,16
206,Not worth the money,"The hotel is nice- Vladimir on concierge was lovely and welcoming. However, at almost ‚Ç¨200 per night, we were disappointed that we were unable to have dinner as the restaurant closes at 5pm on a Sunday and also the roof top bar was closed all day. I would expect that you are able to use all facilities at a 5 star hotel or that it is at least communicated and reflected in the price when certain aspects are not available.
The room was nice but smell of sewers when shower was on ruined it.
TV only had about 12 channels too - not even freeview. Odd for a 5 star hotel.

Personally, I wouldn't return and would opt for a hotel closer to the centre next time at a lower price.",3,2018,05,16
206,Wonderful hotel in Dublin,My wife and I recently enjoyed a flawless stay at the Marker in Dublin. The staff was wonderful and inviting and helpful. The property is beautiful and nicely located. Food and beverage well priced and delicious. We will return. Great place to stay.,5,2018,05,15
206,Superb stay,"Everything about our stay here was fabulous from the charming staff at check in, to the fantastic room, relaxing spa, super cool rooftop bar, amazing breakfast choice and lovely brasserie. Couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough. Would definitely stay again. Well worth the miney. Great stay. Thank you.",5,2018,05,15
206,Wonderful stay and simply perfect for the Bord Gais Theatre.,"Modern hotel with super service, valet parking etc. Excellent bar food and top class breakfast.

206,Honeymoon stay,"

I just want to express my thanks to all the staff in The Marker, for making our stay unforgettable from beginning to end.
Thank you again for the room upgrade and all the fabulous treats left in store for us. It really was a memorble homeymoon stay!¬†
The food was delicious both the lunch and dinner in the bar and the roof top bar with cocktails were amazing!!¬†
The staff went above and beyond to help and make us welcome.

I highly recommend The Marker if you are staying in Dublin. It was luxury from the moment we arrived!! ",5,2018,05,14
206,Bank holiday bliss,"My husband and I had the most fabulous night away. From the moment you arrive and your car is parked for you the end, every whole is catered too. I cannot wait to go back again.  The roof top bar was amazing. The service was fantastic.",5,2018,05,14
206,A wonderful stay,"Modern, clean hotel with very engaged service team. Loved the rooftop bar and location was easy to walk from.  Rooms are spacious and we had a wonderful corner view of the Quay. Robert in Concierge Services was exceptional with recommendations for dining and shopping. Will be back!",5,2018,05,14
206,Exceptional service. Catered to professionals.,"Booked 2 days before our stay so didn‚Äôt do much research and was blown away by the exceptional service. The staff in every department are attentive and really work to ensure you have a great experience. Particular shoutout to Alex and Gab who were so professional and attentive during our stay. The rooms are new and nice and the washroom is very large. It‚Äôs definitely a 5 star experience because you feel pampered the entire time. Please note that if you‚Äôre looking for a hotel that‚Äôs within walking distance of the craziness of Temple Bar, this is not your hotel. They‚Äôre more catered to business clients and a mile away from the central activities. The only thing that I recommend to mgmt is for there to be places for usb charging in the rooms. So many international visitors forget to bring a converter and being able to charge with your usb is just vital now.",5,2018,05,13
206,Really nice hotel in a great location,Went to Dublin and stayed at the Marker. It was a great hotel and reasonably priced. Only complaint is bathroom is dark but spacious. I‚Äôd definitely stay again. The front desk personnel were terrific. ,4,2018,05,13
206,Brilliant place to stay in Dublin,"The Marker Hotel exceeded our expectations. It is modern, luxurious and located in a great part of town. All staffers were friendly, helpful and service oriented. The roof top bar is a lovely place to enjoy a drink and take in the view. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this place to friends and family spending time in Dublin.",5,2018,05,13
206,Almost Perfect,"Dublin's newest hotel, in the new docklands area. Great location, although some distance from the city centre (within walking distance). The hotel is very modern. Staff are very friendly and attentive (remembering my preference during our 6 nights stay). 

Room is spacious. Has all the utilities to make a stay away from home feels like home. The bed is so so comfortable. Only negative is the lighting in the room, it would be great if the room lighting is improved. 

The pool is amazing. Fitness centre is good too. The hotel offers complimentary bicycle hire. 

The breakfast has lots of variety. The rooftop bar is worth a visit (limited opening days when we were there). The Brasserie has nice food. 

Concierge are vey knowledgable. Booked a very early tour, and staff helped us pack breakfast for our trip with a coffee- which is a very nice touch so early in the morning. A great start to our tour.",4,2018,05,13
206,Wonderful stay,"VERY high speed internet, bathroom lovely with HEATED floorboards (soooo nice), bathtub long enough for me to sit down with both of my knees straight (I am 1.7 metres tall) and a tiny bit more room to spare, bed was very comfortable, the aircon could be turned off completely (I am very very sensitive to noise) which helped me to achieve very high quality sleep (that I don't normally get when away from home). The baguette for breakfast was amazing, better than what I am now having in Paris. The room service was fantastic. They folded my clothes everyday after cleaning my room. The laundry they did for me came back perfectly ironed and hanged including undergarments. Difficult to fault them - only wish they had some leafy greens for breakfast as I am vegetarian and a health food fanatic, but that is really a very small thing. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel, and wouldn't really seriously consider staying elsewhere in Dublin if ever I was to visit again. ",5,2018,05,09
206,It‚Äôs Okay!,"Nice modern hotel (2008) but not friendly nor well located unless your on business for a tech giant.  All the tourist stuff is 20 plus minute walk.

Pool hours are very restricted for kids.

Food in hotel is mediocre at best!

Other choices for the same euro so we won‚Äôt be back!",4,2018,05,09

please check out the rooftop bar - amazing !
location is superb - middle of tech city and regeneration docklands. old Dublin 15 -20min away by walking.",5,2018,05,06
206,Simply excellent,"My wife and I stayed for a long weekend break and we were so glad we did! The beds are extremely comfortable, the food served in the Brasserie & Bar is both delicious and was service was very quick. The drink selection was excellent.
The spa & pool was perfect to relax in on a Sunday morning and the terrace & rooftop bar areas were a great way to chill and pass the time in the sun. The hotel is set in a great area with easy links into the city and to the airport buss links. And if you are seeing a show at the Bord Gais you won‚Äôt find anywhere closer!

But what really made this experience excellent was the hotel staff. From the doorman to the guest relation managers, everyone was friendly, highly competent & professional and had a real drive to ensure our stay was as enjoyable as possible. We were honestly reluctant to check out when our holiday was over and will definitely stay again!",5,2018,05,05
206,"Perfect Location, great room, fantastic breakfast","Combo of business and pleasure brought me to Dublin and the Marker. It was the perfect hotel for me. Location by the Canal was both central enough to walk everywhere, and quiet enough not to be bothered by the crowds. Staff were service-oriented, but not intrusive. Room was roomy and comfy. Great bathtub and shower with radiant heat in the marble floor. Just walking in made me go: ",5,2018,05,04
206,Very comfortable stay at a modern & friendly place in the heart of Dublin‚Äôs docklands,"Pleasant comfortable room, lovely bathroom.
Very good food in the bar & brasserie. The staff were very 
efficient with a friendly service. 
Thoroughly enjoyed it & will definitely return and next time visit the popular roof bar which looks like a great place to chill",5,2018,05,04
206,Amazing Hotel,Absolutely loved my stay at the marker. My fianc√© and I were here for a few nights and the staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. The hotel itself is a sleek modern design and easy to navigate. The location is just enough out of the city that it‚Äôs quiet at night but walkable to all the main areas of town. Would absolutely stay here again. ,5,2018,05,02
206,The Best Hotel in Dublin,"OMG - it's is the Best of the Best! Very modern, in a great location with amazing service and facilities. I wish I could live in that hotel. It has everything you need - a swimming pool, gym, spa, roof top bar, spacious rooms. I'll definetly stay in this hotel again.",5,2018,05,02
206,Fabulous weekend away,"We travelled to Dublin for a 3 day weekend and booked the hotel based on reviews - we were not disappointed! Our room was lovely, well equipped and spacious and the staff could not have been more warm, friendly or accommodating. We didn't eat in the hotel (we prefer to explore city restaurants) but the bars and restaurants were always full and with a great atmosphere. We did enjoy the rooftop bar on both evenings that we stayed - sunny, blue sky with gorgeous views of Dublin. The area is spacious and very easy to walk into the ""tourist centre"" if you prefer - we actually rented the Dublin bikes that you pick up and drop off at various sites across the city - great fun. Wonderful stay - can recommend the hotel highly.",5,2018,05,01
206,Luxury,"Very comfortable luxury hotel located outside the city centre. Rooms were very well appointed with modern bathrooms. All the staff we encountered were very efficient and friendly. We did not include breakfast as it was quite expensive, but there are many options nearby. There's free wifi in all areas. Concierge was very useful in suggesting activities.",4,2018,04,30
206,Great Hotel,"Stayed here for a birthday treat and took in a show at Bord Gais, we had a lovely dinner and drinks in the bar area. Fab room with great view and enjoyed a swim, bed was comfortable and you cannot beat this location. The manager on duty was particularly lovely as we asked could we get a seat (we had reserved one but it seemed to have been taken) she organised a table but at that stage we just had time for drinks, they brought over a lovely birthday treat for my husband and it was a really nice touch. Would definitely stay again",5,2018,04,30
206,Good but dont think i would return,"We went th the Marker for our Anniversary weekend.  It was lovely with a nice added touch in our bedroom of an anniversary dessert! This hotel is nice but it is expensive for what you get... nothing wrong with it but i did expect more for the price.
Badly designed rooms, no socket close to a mirror to dry my hair was a big pain, the room aside from that was very comfortable and quiet.
I thought breakfast very overpriced, the food was only warm, i ordered poached eggs both mornings under cooked on one of the days.  Good service and cannot fault the staff as they were very helpful & courteous.
The spa was amazing really enjoyed my treatment, the pool area is too dark... i did not enjoy it, i know the hotel had a dark painted theme but some more natural light would really help.",4,2018,04,30
206,St Patrick‚Äôs Day - Fantastic Effort with lots to do,"I was excited to come stay in Dublin for St Patrick‚Äôs day and what a great choice. We were greeted at reception by the general manager Charlie Sheil who amazingly remembered us from a previous stay amongst probably thousands of customers. 

Yulia on reception offered the best check-in I have experienced yet, full of enthusiasm and interest and got us off to a great start. 

We were greeted with a complimentary Guinness (St Patrick‚Äôs day special) and Galway oysters with full show cooking and commentary. Not to forget the shamrocks to pin on our jackets. 

A 4 piece band set the atmosphere with traditional Irish music whilst we enjoyed top class cocktails (perhaps a little too much!) We made use of the roof top bar and it is an experience in itself with world class service, great views of the city and canal and plenty of fun!

We‚Äôd like to thank Johnny, Gabriel, Andrei, Andrea, Vladimir and Derek for making us feel so welcome. 

My wife had a hot shell massage from the spa the next day which she says is the best she‚Äôs had, in comparison to other top class spas including Galgorm Resort. I enjoyed the infinity pool and jacuzzi which has a unique ‚Äòdark‚Äô setting. 

Rooms are unique and ultra modern with marble bathrooms and underfloor heating. Room service was prompt and personal. 

We finished our stay with the John Stone steak and the cooking was on par with everything else in the hotel. 

I hope to see you all again soon and enjoy the top class standards you are setting.

Roof top bar at night with cocktails then Breakfast in bed AMAZING!Felt like a rockstar. Thanks Guys!",5,2018,04,29
206,Business Trip Dublin,"The Marker is an excellent hotel overall and very clean with some good facilities particularly the pool.  It is not a cheap hotel, however, I do think it could improve on its service in a few areas even though I regularly stay here on my trips to Dublin.  Overall the staff are friendly and will try and accommodate guest requests for food that may not be on the menu.",4,2018,04,27
206,Business stay,Very friendly and helpful staff. Perfect location for business in and around the IFSC. Unfortunately the rooftop bar was not open. Would highly recommend as the rooms are very comfortable and clean. Excellent. ,5,2018,04,27
206,A gem,"Can‚Äôt fault the marker so comfortable and friendly 
The rooftop bar is a must v relaxing the pool is just pure relaxation 
It‚Äôs home from home with a touch off class...it‚Äôs only 10 min walk to the hussle off shops ",5,2018,04,24
206,Weekend Break at The Marker Hotel Dublin,"5 star contemporary style hotel in the Dublin's financial district area.
The property is well connected to the city center and rooms are wonderful. I I will definitively be back again for enjoying the city and the hotel's spa.",5,2018,04,24
206,Modern Luxury,"This was our first stay, and the Marker is exactly the type of hotel we seek for a weekend break. The room decor and finish is crisp and modern, and the hotel service prompt and friendly. Services like valet parking were delivered quickly, and typically in a shorter time period than quoted by the concierge. The room was well attended and provisioned.

From a location perspective, the hotel is well placed around a modern square with several dining and night-life options to suit different budgets, with the city centre a short taxi ride away (8-15 euro depending on traffic).

This was also a good value stay vs the older 5 star hotels around Dublin, and even some of the more central 4 star offerings. I would strongly recommend paying the small additional fee for a room overlooking grand canal square, or even a corner suite.",5,2018,04,24
206,Anniversary weekend ,"This is not a budget hotel by any means - everything about it is quality: the staff greeted us on arrival and looked after us really well throughout our stay. There was a problem with our room (smell of drains) which was sorted out instantly we raised it with the front desk by upgrading us to a canal-side room. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I would have preferred no problems but customer service is about how you sort out problems and they dealt with it well. 
Food at breakfast and dinner was good and the spa amazing. 
Pricey but a most excellent way to spend an anniversary weekend ",4,2018,04,23
206,A luxurious stay,"Wow, I was incredibly impressed with the Marker. The staff, facilities, food, and spa were all superb. It was a luxurious trip at a fantastic price. When you arrive there is someone there immediately to help you out of the taxi and take you to the concierge. The rooms were spacious and comfortable, and my favorite was the heated marble floors in the bathroom! I had a phenomenal dinner at the hotel restaurant (starter, main course, dessert, and wine for just 54 euros). I had a fantastic facial at their spa, which includes unlimited time in a relaxation room afterwards where you are provided a very comfortable seat & blanket in addition to orange juice and mango sorbet. I honestly preferred spending my free time enjoying the hotel rather than sightseeing. I haven't been able to stop raving about the hotel and staff since I left. ",5,2018,04,23
206,The real 5 star experience,"We received a genuine 5* experience from the outset. All our needs were met; from hair straightener being provided, to the lovely spa, and fantastic drinks on the roof top bar (recommendation; Watermelon Martini). Our room was spacious and modern. The service top quality. And the starting the day in the Spa before a long day in Dublin was ideal.",5,2018,04,23
206,Hotel review,This hotel was lovely to stay in.we loved the area all around the hotel. The only quibble would be is that dublin hotels are very expensive .would stay there again if I need a weekend in dublin.would recommend to friends.,4,2018,04,23
206,Great location with access to high tech companies in the docklands,"The Marker was a wonderful upscale stay near my office. I got in on the red eye and checked in early which was wonderful. They had wonderful linens and bath amenities. Their turndown service was always welcome. 

They are close to a small grocer which is nice for small things. 

The view on the canal is beautiful on a sunny day. 

Also they had a baby bliss hair dryer which is always a sign of a nice hotel. 

My only complaint is the location of power outlets. There isn‚Äôt an outlet for a hair dryer in the bathroom or near a mirror. Seems like design by a man not a woman. 

",5,2018,04,22
206,Luxury and Comfort,"Outstanding luxury services. Everything from Tomasz(sp), our Valet, the outstanding room, the pool and sauna, to the relaxing comfortable beds. This establishment is top notch, and a must stay for us, from now on.",5,2018,04,22
206,Perfect retreat for 2!,"Went to the marker for an overnight stay. Staff made us so welcome. The amenities were outstanding and you could tell you were in an upmarket and cutting-edge hotel. Food at the breakfast the following day was excellent. 

It was my wife‚Äôs birthday and they placed some very nice sweet treats in the room for her and a very nice card wishing her happy birthday, thank you for that it was great. 

The room was great v quiet and bed was very comfortable. The WiFi was quick and secure to each room. Staff were always helpful. Pool area was stunning. 

Area in which hotel situated was a leisurely 15 mins walk to Grafton street. The only reason for the 4 rather than 5 stars is 1 the cost of the valet parking ‚Ç¨24 was a bit much but nice of them to place bottled water in the car on return of the car. 

Number 2 is that the menu in the bar meals area could be a bit more down to earth. The food in the brasserie is haute cuisine and cutting edge foody which reflects the hotel stature. But. The Bar food could have been more plainer simple burger meals etc to cater for simpler needs. 

All in all though a superb stay and will be back. Thank you to all the staff",4,2018,04,22
206,Decent hotel but lacks 5 star quality. Poor for a '5 star'. Average for a hotel in general.,"For my anniversary, I stayed in the Marker in January 2018. We wanted a 5 star experience and chose The Marker after we had read generally positive reviews on TripAdvisor. However, we were both very disappointed with the stay and will be going elsewhere in future. We were most disappointed with the hospitality and responsiveness of staff. 

The hotel lacked five star quality throughout. In hindsight, we should have went elsewhere at check in where staff insisted that we were required to pay for our room in advance if we did not have a credit card. It is exceptionally poor policy on their behalf. Secondly, we were not informed that the rooftop bar was closed. The Marker are well aware that this is one of their hotel's main attractions. It is not unreasonable for a customer paying a premium price for a hotel to be informed that one of the main selling points of the hotel is closed. Maybe (obviously) this explains why we were not informed at check in. On a rare positive note, the hotel did allow us to check in early and the room was clean.

The room was clean, comfortable albeit fairly standard and basic. As we were celebrating, we decided to treat ourselves to a glass of wine. I rang the reception and was informed that I needed to ring the bar instead. At the time, I thought this was poor enough customer service but left it go. Generally if you ring a hotel reception to order anything, the receptionist will go above and beyond to cater for your needs and arrange any service themselves, if possible. I know this is a small thing but it is an example of the lack of quality hospitality  prevalent throughout, in all the finer details. Surely after ordering the wine from the bar it should not take 45 minutes to deliver it to the room? 

Another small item to note was the turn down service. Turn down service is a fairly standard perk to most quality hotels but not The Marker. You have to specifically ask for this service to be provided. Normally, it is the other way around where you indicate to staff that you would prefer this service to not be provided. Whereas with The Marker, you felt like an inconvenience by having to request 'special treatment' by ordering turn down service. 5 star quality? No. 

On to the bar. I would not recommend The Marker bar if you are looking for somewhere with atmosphere. I would expect (hope) the rooftop bar is a better experience. It was a Sunday night so maybe that would explain the lack of atmosphere as the bar was quiet. But that cannot explain why the hospitality was so poor. Firstly, I decided to order an Apple Martini. A fairly standard cocktail. Well, you would think so anyway. But the barman did not know how to make it. Fair enough? I decided to order a beer instead and thankfully that was fine. We were peckish and noticed other tables had nuts provided to them so when it came to our second round of drinks we asked for nuts to be provided. Again, you would think this would just be standard for a 5 star hotel but we had to ask. Fair enough? It would have been great if the bar man actually provided the nuts at that stage but maybe that was too much to ask. Two requests later the nuts did eventually make it to the table. 

The spa was fine but maybe we were expecting too much. The pool was too cold on our first day but was nice on the second day. The seating provided was not comfortable at all. No flip flops were provided. I did not expect to have to bring my own flip flops as other this is a fairly basic provision in other hotel spas. 

Overall, as you can tell from the above, our stay was very disappointing. We paid a premium to stay there and expected five star treatment, especially for our anniversary. It was all the finer details adding up to give a poor impression. We felt like an inconvenience to staff and did not enjoy the stay. We aired our disappointment to the hotel manager and to be fair he did offer us a half price stay. However, it goes as no surprise that we rejected this offer. I would not stay there again for free. 

The alternative four and five star options in Dublin and beyond are far superior, and more deserving of your custom.",2,2018,04,22
206,An excellent hotel,"Staff is very friendly.  Nice contemporary design of the hotel and rooms.  Great location near the water and close to most major tech companies.  Rooms are very comfortable, good noise insulation and bed.  Reasonably fast wi-fi internet.",5,2018,04,22
206,"Decent hotel, facilities and food failed to deliver. ","Had a very pleasant stay here, staff very friendly and accommodating. Nice rooms. Had 2 evening meals which failed to impress. Both were average and costly... Spa facilities are nice but basic. Steam room practically steam less and jacuzzi jets very weak. ",3,2018,04,20
206,"Comfortable, stylish, expensive","I had a large comfortable stylish room. My view was over the Grand Canal docks area and the Bord Gais theatre.
A high standard of fitting, although some niggles related to design taking precedence over usability.
For example, the bath taps need an instruction sign on the wall - but it's in English only.
The bathroom has adjustable underfloor heating.
Very quiet sleep and a very good breakfast choice. I had porridge both days and my request for a softer result on the second day was met. 
The staff are well trained, responsive, and attentive. Unfortunately the bar stops serving food after 10 pm and my companion relaxing before driving on home could not get even a sandwich. You'd think it wouldn't be hard to have a cold cabinet with sandwiches or a plate of crackers and cheese, which don't require a kitchen.
The bedroom niggle for me is that although most hotels have power sockets at the bedside, here they are too far away to be able to both charge my phone and have it within reach on the bedside table.

206,Mark,"From the heated marble floors in the hotel rooms to the infinity-styled indoor pool and adjacent whirlpool, steam room and gym (all included with your hotel room), to the roof top bar (not perfect in the rain, but there are other indoor options at the hotel), to the decent, if uninspired Brassiere Restaurant at the hotel, which offers a range of entrees from fresh sea foods to several red meats, this hotel is a true keeper if you are heading to Dublin. From the doormen, to the front desk staff and concierge, the staff is professional, warm, friendly, and exceedingly helpful. Located in the trendy Docks section, just south of the river dividing the city, within easy walking distance to the Grafton St. area with Trinity College and numerous restaurants and bars, the hotel is on a plaza featuring the city's big theatre and more restaurants and bars. Also handy just across the plaza is Fresh market (sort of a European version of Whole Foods, with groceries and fresh prepared foods for takeout. Really, mark ",5,2018,04,19

206,"Exceptional Service, superb hotel !","I will keep this short. 
Dublin tends to be fairly expensive for hotels, and you would be crazy not to pay the difference and stay at The Marker. The hotel is exceptional and that is all down to the bespoke service. We received a lovely email before our stay, we got a great reception when we landed extremely early in the morning and  they were helpful throughout. Its just the nice touches of them arranging us access to a room early, the concierge parking and then them leaving some water in our car for our long onward journey. 
We were at a gig on the Friday night, down at Three Arena/The Point and this hotel is great for access to there. It isn't far from the centre either. 
Superb stuff. 
",5,2018,04,16
206,Prices from hell ..great bathrooms and rooftop bar its redeeming features!,"Stayed here for one night, prices highly exorbitant mainly its food (Breakfast) and drink prices.Our room was also overpriced for what it was only to be redeemed by a great bathroom,particularly its shower facility.

I had not booked a treatment in the spa however the place looked lovely and the pool area in general is vert relaxing as no children are allowed after 5 pm so adults can have quiet time ,5,2018,04,12
206,Easter Break at the Marker,Had a great stay at the Marker - the room was lovely and the beds so comfortable.  Very easy to walk to the centre of Dublin and there was a shuttle bus to the centre on weekends.  The breakfast was gorgeous.  Didn't want to leave the hotel.,5,2018,04,11
206,Great Stay at this Luxury Hotel,"We spent a long weekend at the Marker and it was a wonderful experience. Check in and check out went smoothly (they even had our room ready 5 hours early to accommodate our early flight arrival). The staff were always attentive and ready to help.  We were on the top floor (6th floor) and the room had a great view.  The room itself had plenty of space, great amenities, heated floors in the bathroom, etc.  Highly recommend this place.  

We didn't spend much time in the restaurant or the bar but both seemed popular.  Prices for food/drinks might be a little on the high side but they don't lack in quality.  We did check out the rooftop bar which offers a great view of the city and the hills in the distance.  Nice selection of drinks.

While this hotel is not right in the city center, everything is still conveniently accessible. Guinness storehouse (which is on the opposite end of the city) was a 17 euro cab ride and the city center is a 10-12 euro ride. Walking is also possible.  We didn't find out until the last day but the hotel even offers a couple free bicycles for guests to use.

Stay here!",5,2018,04,10
206,Fantastic Hotel,"Great stay at the Marker Hotel. Staff were outstanding , very professional and polite. The Spa facilities are lovely. We had two treatments at the spa, both excellent, even if a little expensive. Room temperature was temperamental and the heating in the bathroom floor never got warm. Overall very happy with our stay.",5,2018,04,10
206,Weekend break,A fantastic and luxurious stay.  Great attentive service from all staff whilst there and amazing facilities to enjoy. Highlights were the spa and the rooftop bar (gets busy on a sunny Friday night though!) ,5,2018,04,10
206,Lovely weekend stay,"Picked the marker based on other reviews and it‚Äôs location near the 3 arena. Everything is nearby after a short walk, the do Dublin bus circuit is right on our doorstep and the hotel itself is fantastic, modern and the spa is so relaxing. Staff are very helpful and friendly. Only bad thing would say the beds are soft so it‚Äôs not what we are used to and so we didn‚Äôt sleep very comfortably but all in all was perfect for a weekend break :) thank you :)",5,2018,04,10
206,Fabulous comfort and convenience,Stayed for business - hotel is adjacent our EU HQ and I‚Äôve steered away in the past due to slightly higher prices.  I thoroughly get the difference now - and will quite happily stay again given the opportunity.,5,2018,04,09
206,Fantastic Stay,"We had a fantastic stay at the Marker for our wedding day. The staff were extremely friendly, informative and on hand to help with anything. The room was impeccable with a fantastic view of Grand Canal",5,2018,04,09

206,Modern hotel with great amenities,"Modern hotel with distinctive design and in a great location. Staff was very courteous and helpful. Great rooms and big kudos for the rooftop bar, which offers expansive views of Dublin, though you have to be lucky with the weather. Thankfully the staff is always well prepared and offer blankets and heaters. ",5,2018,04,08
206,Excellent ,Popped in with no booking for a pre theatre bite. Place was buzzing but they were all over it. Table within 5 mins. Professional friendly efficient service. Excellent food. Loved the prawn pasta and proper food on the kids menu. Highly recommend before a visit to the Bord Gais ,5,2018,04,06
206,Fabulous day of Spa and Food,"My sister and I visited The Marker today. We had an amazing pedicure in the spa, followed by lunch in the bar. Service was amazing from start to finish. Dylan, our waiter, went above and beyond to look after us even suggesting we finish our lunch with the banoffee (‚Äúthe best in Dublin‚Äù we were told!!) Thanks for the advice, we will be back again!! An afternoon well spent!ü•Ç",5,2018,04,05
206,Good but out of the way,"About a 25 minute walk to city center. So great for business and during the week but a cab ride at night to an from. The pool, sauna and steam are awesome. breakfast is wonderful too.  Our room was a corner suite so super quiet.  I was surprised there was no turn down service. ",4,2018,04,05
206,Wow!!! You guys have it together!!!,"Spent 3 nights end of March and couldn‚Äôt have been more pleased with The Marker!!! From arrival to check out everything was perfect, it was my partners birthday so they had a HB plater on the room upon arrival, nice touch!!! The room was modern, elegant and beautiful overlooking the canal, the bathroom was luxurious and spotless, I liked the warm flooring feature!!! The hotel lobby bar was always bustling and had great small food menu!!! Breakfast was delicious!!! The spa and pool area was so peaceful!!! Front desk recommended a great restaurant for dinner our first night and was delicious!!! Location was great, packed with modern buildings and some restaurants, 20 minutes walk from major tourist sites including Temple Bar!!! I can‚Äôt recommend thus hotel enough!!! My thanks to All personnel that made this a memorable stay at The Marker!!! Loved Dublin all together!!!",5,2018,04,05
206,The Marker,"An amazing hotel, the staff, facilities and hotel itself were totally flawless. They went over and above for the children as well as the adults. Food was beautiful in the Bar area and the roof top bar had scenic view over the city, although obviously not the Hotels fault  - it was freezing cold but nice to see all the same.",5,2018,04,05
206,Ric and Heather Craig,No better place to stay on a rainy day in Dublin!  It is a very relaxing place to stay and perfect for a short break. The Concierge was especially helpful and attentive.  Excellent Hotel - feels like a real treat to stay in it!  Looking forward to the next trip!,5,2018,04,05
206,Nice Hotel with room for improvements,"The Hotel is a great place to spend a weekend in Dublin. It‚Äôs a little far from the center, but we really liked the location. 
The rooms are nice with comfy beds. Breakfast is great. They have a huge buffet. 
So where is the room for improvements?
We had 2 issues in our room. Nothing big but on my opinion in a five star Hotel everything should work. Unfortunately they where not able to fix it during our 4 night stay. Also they forgot to order our Taxi twice. 
Other then that we had a great stay and certainly might come back to this place. ",4,2018,04,04
206,A great place to stay in the city,Spent a lovely night in the Marker  hotel. We were attending a show in the Bord Gais theater and decided to stay overnight in the adjacent hotel as it was a birthday and anniversary celebration. As a result we were offered a room upgrade and glass of champagne. A lovely thought. The room was very big and had all the amenities you expect with excellent service. The highlight was the visit to the rooftop bar-A cold and damp night but with blankets and hot water bottles beautiful and probably better than a warm night as there were very few people there. The staff were excellent and nothing was too much trouble. Not a cheap night out but a lovely treat.,5,2018,04,04
206,Excellent as always,"Fantastic trip to one of our favourite Dublin hotels,  Everything met our expectations and thank you for the birthday attention that was awaiting me in my bedroom on arrival... I'm just looking forward to my next stay in June now....",5,2018,04,04
206,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed for 5 days over Easter, the staff all went above and beyond to assist in any thing we asked. We had a Luxury Corner suite which had great views over the river. Breakfast was served quickly and food was of a high standard. Doorman always managed to get taxis quickly. Barrie on reception spent a long time with us when we checked in to make sure we had restaurants  booked and we knew where we were going. Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2018,04,04
206,"Kind of like a W, but even better seevxe","Very cool hotel, inside and out.    It has that swanky feel of a W,  but not as pricey.   The location is so-so.   We mostly took taxis to Temple Bar and other spots around the city.   Inside, the rooms are modern with large windows.    The staff is friendly and responsive.   The inside downstairs bar is a great place for drinks and bites.    The rooftop bar service was lacking, the only time we found service lacking in the 4 days we stayed at the Marker.    Concierge and check in staff was very helpful.    Gym is well appointed and adequately sized.   It can get a little crowded in there, but could have been coincidence.   I rarely see 8 people in most hotel gyms at the same time.   On this stay, we shared the gym with 4-8 people on 3 different days.    It‚Äôs a bonus that the gym/spa are connected so you have access to the large pool and the spa facilities sauna, steam room etc.   Good hours, open early and late.

Overall, loved it and would definitely consider staying here again.",5,2018,04,03
206,Fantastic Service,This was our first time staying at The Marker and we will definitely return.   The staff could not do enough for us and made us feel extremely welcome.    Lots of little touches like putting bottles of water into our car for our journey home -  first class.,5,2018,04,03
206,Luxurious and welcoming hotel,"Would highly recommend. 
The excellent 5 star service from staff really made our stay fantastic. 
Spacious, clean, comfortable and luxurious hotel. 
Bedroom was perfect and the bathroom with the heated floor was amazing! 
Enjoyed the breakfast and spa also. Would stay again.",5,2018,04,02
206,First class experience in Dublin,"We stayed at the Marker over Easter weekend, and it was a joy to be a guest of the hotel.  The staff was terrific, the accommodations both lovely and a good value and the whole experience helped make our stay a real pleasure.  The hotel cafe and restaurant are great for breakfast and late night, and you can walk everywhere from where it is located.",5,2018,04,02
206,Dublin Trip,Booked the Marker for ourselves & another couple over Easter for girls to go to Sam Smith concert. Great service & a great location for concert. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. My only criticism would be the shower cubicles were a little small but certainly not enough to stop us using the Marker again,5,2018,04,02
206,Best Hotel in Dublin!,"High quality services, amazing food, spectacular people. The hotel is beautiful and everyone is really kind and professional. It is a pleasure to stay at your hotel. I can guarantee you that when plan my next time in Dublin, I will choose you :) ",5,2018,04,02
206,"Sloppy, dirty, amateur ... Can I have my money back?","For 275 Euros per night, this hotel should be providing more of a clean, upscale , quality environment. Clogged shower drains, rooms not cleaned on schedule, and a silent untrained staff make it a 1-star...but I gave it 2 because it was close to the 3Arena (we had tickets to a show which was a convenient 10 minute walk along the river). Other than that, nothing else for which to commend this establishment. 
So sad.",2,2018,04,01
206,"One word, exceptional","One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Very subtle, understated class but it is the staff that shine. They are thoroughly engaging and empowered to deliver a consistently exceptional service. Fantastic location surrounded by great restaurants bars and the Bord Gais theatre. ",5,2018,03,31
206,A nice hotel,"The hotel is a very nice design hotel situate d  in the financial Quarter of Dublin.
It is a bit far from the City Center, about 20 minutes walk. Fortunately the taxis are cheap.
The rooms are very clean, comfortable and full of amenities.

Negative point: the buffet breakfast is not a 5star hotel, very poor Choice. 

",4,2018,03,31
206,"Great city hotel in a lovely area - ideal for business, leisure and family","Excellent hotel in a good location - close to city centre and idea for Bord Gais Energy Theatre. Large and spacious rooms, well appointed and very peaceful.  Excellent staff and a wonderful breakfastGreat city hotel in a lovely area - ideal for business, leisure and family",5,2018,03,31
206,Fantastic!,"I absolutely loved my weekend at the Marker, everything was just top notch. 

The suite we were in was huge and beautifully decorated. It was spotless and the turn down service was great.

The bar area was a lovely modern place to relax before of after a meal and have a nice wine or cocktail.

It is without doubt the best hotel I've stayed in.

I loved It!",5,2018,03,29
206,SPRING VISIT,"Well it was nearly spring and we did have a bit of sunshine.

The hotel is modern and part of the Dublin Docklands development. Really nice and well located 

My wife had stayed here previously 3 years ago and we returned based on that good experience

We were not disappointed. 

The staff  are friendly, courteous, knowledgeable  and anxious to please you the customer. What a breath of fresh air to a lot of London hotels

But this is Dublin!!

The rooms are spacious with COMFORTABLE beds. The public areas are spacious and airy. Breakfast is well presented and quite sufficient for the start  of the day.

Definitely recommended !!!",5,2018,03,28
206,Wow - great hotel,By far the best hotel I have stayed at for a long while. Good sized room with great facilities in the room. Excellent staff who were all very friendly and helpful. The food (especially breakfast) was superb.,5,2018,03,27
206,Fantastic!,"We stayed in the Marker for one night recently, from start to finish we had a fantastic stay. Our room was fab, spotlessly clean, the staff were so attentive and polite, they really could not have done enough.
I would highly recommend the Marker!",5,2018,03,26
206,Romance in the Marker ,"My life partner and I stayed two nights in the marvellous  Marker hotel. We found the staff and facilities to be absolutely wonderful. The service was exemplary,  in particular Sandra who looked after us so well in the restaurant. The atmosphere throughout the hotel left one feeling calm , relaxed and pampered. 

We ordered room service one night and was served by a delightful young man who provides a delicious meal in the surroundings of out opulent room.

In summary if you want a restful stay with every detail considered the Marker is a must. ",5,2018,03,25
206,St Paddy's Day,"Stayed a couple of nights over the weekend and especially chose the hotel to be out of the middle of town as the celebrations took place. It might have been the cold and the snow but it did feel more than a mile away from the festivities and the surrounding area is fairly dead at the weekend except for the theater. Hotel was modern, clean and comfortable.",4,2018,03,22
206,No complaints,No complaints at all on this hotel. Service very friendly and professional and the room was immaculate. About a 15-20 minute walk to where all the bars and restaurants are so nicely located for 'not-too-far -but-far-enough' for the best of both type people. We got taxi back a couple of times which was around ‚Ç¨5.,5,2018,03,22
206,Perfect location,My friend and I stayed in The Marker recently when we were attending a show in the Bord GaisTheatre. Everything aboutour stay was perfect.The hotel was luxurious and the staff were very pleasant and helpful.  There are lotsofnice restaurants near thehoteland it is right beside the Theatre.  It couldn't have been better.,5,2018,03,21
206,Marker for St. Patty's Day,"Nice hotel... clean and modern.  Staff are exceptional and always looking to please.  The rooms themselves are relatively average compared to North American standards, although still nice.  We booked the corner suite and it really wasn't a suite at all.  There was a small room between ours and the adjoining room that had no furniture and was pretty much useless.  However, having said that, the actual room itself was nice and the bed very comfortable.  The washroom and shower area is very nice as well.  We were fortunate to have a housekeeper that was meticulous and looked after us very well the entire time we were there.  The bar lounge area is well done and always lively.  A great place to relax with a drink at the end of the day.",5,2018,03,21
206,Another great stay,"This was our second stay at the Marker and we enjoyed it just as much as the first time. All the staff are so friendly and helpful. You are made to feel very welcome and nothing is too much trouble.. The rooms are lovely, and the addition of the Nespresso machine is great.. Breakfast is excellent with lots of choices.  It was my birthday whilst there. The staff in the bar made it very special and  I was given a complimentary desert with a birthday message..  The spa is very nice and worth a visit.. A special mention to Zoltan and Sylvia who went out of their way to deal with a very small problem we had.  We will definitely be back.",5,2018,03,20
206,Absolutely fantastic hotel!,"This hotel oh my I don't even know where to start! I loved everything! I stayed here with a friend from 16 Mar '18 until 19 Mar '18 for St. Patrick's day weekend and from start to finish the service was impeccable! We had a room (624) which looked out over Grand Canal Dock which was a plus. The room itself was impeccable, we only had a slight issue with the plug on our desk but this was sorted out as fast as possible. The beds were so comfortable and the airco meant there was a constant temperature in the room and it wasn't freezing in the morning! The bathroom tiled in all black is quite impressive and there was a nice selection of toiletries to use. I must credit the cleaning crew because our room was always impeccable, something I haven't always experienced in even some of the most expensive hotels. We also ordered room service a couple of times and again here the service was outstanding, the food was absolutely delicious and the portion sizes are huge! Speaking of food, the breakfast buffet is absolutely amazing, I've never had a selection this huge and all so fresh before, and again the waitress who served us each morning was really friendly and really added a plus to the experience. Sadly I can't remember her name but she has long brown hair with a blunt fringe that she carried in a braid or a bun. The friendliness of all the staff really added that little extra to our stay, I only once encountered a rude/uninterested employee at the desk when we asked for a reservation at their brasserie and she bluntly told us no because of their 'first come first serve' policy, but other than that everyone was super friendly and always on hand to assist with even the smallest insignificant request.
I cannot recommend this hotel enough! Will definitely visit again!",5,2018,03,20
206,Luxury ,"Stayed here over St. Patrick day weekend. We were wowed by the total experience here. We were welcomed immediately, shown to the front desk. Offered a beverage, my wife had a hot tea. The lobby was abuzz , a table set up for oyster sampling, and free half pints of Guinness. 
The room was very luxurious. They brought up a complementary bottle of red wine and later a Irish pound/fruit cake. Both were very good. There‚Äôs a nespresso machine in the room. 
The weather was cold and inclement , we didn‚Äôt want to venture out. We ate at the hotel restaurant and it was very good.
Unfortunately the weather was not very good , but the hotel was great.",5,2018,03,19
206,Visiting family & going to concert,Everybody in our family enjoyed their stay in this beautiful hotel. Central location make it easy to visit anywhere in Dublin and enjoy concerts. Excellent breakfast with gluten free options & we love your staff.,5,2018,03,19
206,Another great stay at The Marker,"Back again for another wonderful time at The Marker, the staff were incredibly helpful and went out of their way to ensure everything was right.
Nice spa facilities and the view from the rooftop bar is stunning",5,2018,03,17
206,Business trip,"A Nice h√¥tel and even if I experienced several issues (leak in the bedroom due to rain on the rooftop, shower broken the 1sr day ...) I have to say that staff has very helpful, efficient and professional offering me an upgraded Bedroom. ",4,2018,03,17
206,Outstanding ,"From the moment we checked until our check out everything was fantastic. 

We were on a hens weekend and we were looked after very well. A complimentary bottle of wine was sent to the bride to be room once they found out the purpose of our stay. 

They kindly gave us a late checkout upon request. The reception and concierge are outstanding and show much attention to detail. A special thanks to Gabriele who was very welcoming and helpful. 

The rooms are clean and modern with large bathrooms. The mini bar could be better stocked with some basic spirits and a wine that is not Chardonnay - I didn‚Äôt think people still drank that lol.

We had treatments in the spa which were all amazing and never with the feeling of being rushed. It‚Äôs finished off with orange juice and mango sorbet in private recovery areas - much better than the cucumber water one usually gets in spas.

The only area I felt let the hotel down was the lobby bar. We never once got served at our table, always having to order from the bar despite there being many staff on duty - they seemed more interested to stand around chatting with each other rather than serve customers. Despite this I still gave a 5 star review because the other areas in the hotel go above and beyond.

An amazing stay and I will definitely stay here again. ",5,2018,03,17
206,Quality Marker,"Excellent room, lovely meal at the bar and a superb breakfast. The Marker is a top class hotel in an excellent location. Staff are professional and attentive and the overall feeling is one of luxury and quality",5,2018,03,15
206,One of our top 3 Hotels in the world,"Service, Service Service!!!!
There is an expectation that a 5/6 star hotel will have excellent amenities, clean and modern rooms, excellent food and a great location. The Marker has all of these spades  But the real difference is the professionalism of the staff. Amazing team of committed hospitality professionals. 
From the ever helpful reception staff, one of the world's best concierge teams, the amazing management team, the ever patient room service teams and the food and beverage staff.
Thank you to all for making our family visit back to Dublin stress free and so enjoyable.",5,2018,03,14
206,Girls' weekend,"Only issue we had was to find previous guest's take away food still in our mini-bar - yeuch!!  Otherwise I couldn't fault anything and as soon as we complained, this was removed and we received an apology along with a complementary bottle of wine.",5,2018,03,14
206,Chilled out comfort,"great service, room, shower food and spa - what more do you need. I will definitely be back. I live in Dublin and was taking my Mum and niece shopping for Mother's Day. We had interconnecting rooms which were great. They both truly enjoyed the experience and are looking forward to returning as am I.",5,2018,03,14
206,Marker,"Beautifully designed throughout, excellent service and one of the best cocktails bars in the city. This, on top of the pool and spa means there's nothing else like it in Dublin. Situated in a lively and vibrant area too.",5,2018,03,13
206,5 star from start to finish,"Mother's day started with the fabulous Le Drunch menu, really couldn't fault a menu that had something for everyone, and that's not just the food. Music played by their fabulous dj had everyone's foot tapping under their table while we ate.The evening finished with gorgeous cocktails in the bar. What more could you want . The Marker Hotel and Staff, great  job well done, especially Sylvia who was so accommodating. ",5,2018,03,11
206,A nice hotel marred by disappointing service,I‚Äôve just arrived home from a weekend stay with friends and family from the Marker. The hotel is very impressive with a spacious lobby area with bar and brasserie. We booked a twin room which was a good size with lovely large beds which were bigger than standard singles. There isn‚Äôt a huge amount of space for clothes just a smallish wardrobe with no shelving and the bathrooms are on the small side with not a lot of space to put any toiletries and no towel rail. Eating in the bar was a nice experience the food was good but pricey. Service throughout the hotel was slow and not great. We booked a table in the rooftop bar with reception this wasn‚Äôt followed through and upon arrival we were told we didn‚Äôt have a table and couldn‚Äôt be accommodated. We then went to the bar downstairs and waited 40 minutes for our drinks to be ordered and made. We had booked a cab with reception to go to our restaurant which didn‚Äôt get booked and therefore made us later than we wanted to be. Dinner in the hotel Brasserie was mediocre for the hefty price tag ‚Ç¨28 for a main course. Overall I think for a 5* hotel it was slightly disappointing the hotel is nice but the service definitely let‚Äôs it down.,3,2018,03,11
206,Great hotel,"The staff is extremely helpful and friendly, rooms are comfortable and spa is a great place to relax after a hard work day. Food is delicious. I lost my earring with a diamond and the cleaning ladies found it and gave it back to me even if I was already checked out. I would totally recommend this hotel. ",5,2018,03,11
206,Very Nice,"Stayed at The Marker for a business trip. Very nice hotel, love the huge bathroom with heated tiles. The bed and bedding were comfortable and I didn't notice any noise problems. Unfortunately we were there when the Beast from the East storm was rolling in, so we didn't get a chance to walk around the area much. Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2018,03,08
206,One Day Stay at The Marker Hotel,I checked in on Monday night. The receptionist provided excellent service and was quick to check me in. I asked about leaving my luggage after check out and was informed that it was certainly possible. Rooms were great. Breakfast was excellent,5,2018,03,08
206,Wonderful service at The Marker in Dublin,"Thank goodness we were staying at The Marker during a snow storm in Dublin.  The Marker team provided exceptional service during our stay, even during the storm.  They knew getting taxis to the airport was going to be difficult and so they organized a shuttle to he airport for their guests.  They had staff stay on property during the snow to ensure they could maintain their level of service.  Really great experience despite the snow!",5,2018,03,06
206,Fabulous Property to Host Clients When Visiting the Silicon Docks,"Brought my clients from the U.S. to visit the Silicon Docks.  The Marker was highly recommended - it delivered as promised.  Perfect location, excellent accommodations and exceptional service.   My clients repeatedly complimented our choice (the large bathrooms with heated floors were a huge hit).  Our trip coincided with the historic winter storm aka ""beast from the east"".  The staff exhibited the utmost professionalism in adjusting our plans to return home safely.   Many thanks to The Marker!",5,2018,03,05
206,GREAT HOTEL BUT SLIGHTLY OVER VALUED,Very good location and very comfy rooms. We had the corner suite and it was quite spacious. The bathroom is the highlight - excellent standard. Overall we felt the price we paid didn‚Äôt reflect the room we got. ,3,2018,03,05
206,Curious customer service,"Good hotel for sure but I had a bad experience which was so strange because it was so easy for them to fix but they chose not to. On checking in, I was welcomed back and asked if I would join the loyalty scheme. Among the advertised benefits was free breakfast and while this benefit wasn‚Äôt available on that stay, the man at the check in counter compelled me to sign up with the offer of free breakfast the next day, 5-star treatment that made me feel special, no doubt!

I don‚Äôt usually do hotel breakfasts and was running a little late the next morning but thought it would be rude not to take advantage of my special free breakfast so I had a little something and checked out confirming I‚Äôd had breakfast and taking a moment to mention that the breakfast had been comped. I paid and they offered an email receipt (good policy). When I got the email receipt I saw I‚Äôd been charged about ‚Ç¨30 for the breakfast plus the tip (which I had voluntarily put on so of course the top was fine). 

I asked for the breakfast charge to be removed and was denied, I protested once or twice all on email and was just straight denied each time. I was amazed and still am.

206,Great hotel,"3 nightbreak in Dublin, 10 min walk or so to city centre but in a great area with amnesties around, gym and spa great, never overly busy, great facilities. Bar and food also great quality. Pricey but that's what you pay if you want quality. Can't have everything for nothing! ",5,2018,03,01
206,"Brilliant hotel in good, quiet location","Cannot fault this hotel.  Perfect for the 6 Nations rugby match we came to see (only 15 minutes walk to the stadium). All the staff were friendly, welcoming and willing to chat. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable, with one of the best bathrooms we have encountered. Although we ate out in the evenings, breakfast was excellent, and the food and cocktails in the bar were enjoyable.  Dublin centre is walkable (just follow the River Liffey), although we tended to use a taxi (around ‚Ç¨8) as the weather was extremely cold.",5,2018,02,28
206,Very nice Hotel,Nice retro hotel in Docklands. Would recommend a cab as it was a challenge to navigate the tiny streets. Good service and buffet was terrific. Found the room a tad small. Dark corridors seem a bit outdated. Rooftop Bar was a lot of fun. ,4,2018,02,28
206,Irish hospitality at its best,"You know of Irish hospitality ? well that's it a thousand times. it's  a great hotel in a central position with a buzzing feel, where you feel at home. Another great member of The Leading H√¥tels of the World. The pool in winter is just soo heartwarming, you feel really relaxed after a time there. Thank you again and I'll be back ",5,2018,02,27
206,Just coffee ,"Pit stop on match day morning whilst we were waiting on our table next door at herbstreet.  Coffee, tea & hot choc for our daughter  . Really cute presentation on the hot choc served with little malt balls & marshmallows.  She loved it with her little portion  of hot frothed milk ! 3 little cookies served as well. Just had 1 as didn't want to ruin breakfast. Staff very friendly and efficienct.  
Would love to try the food menu. Looks delish. ",4,2018,02,26
206,Rugby weekend,"I stayed in this hotel for Ireland Wales Rugby match, great room with a comfy bed. The location was central and ease of access to the city. Bar food good. Loved the burger, fresh and tasty. Love the rooftop bar overlooking g Dublin City",5,2018,02,25
206,Wonderful but way too formal hotel,We went there to celebrate my husband's birthday and the room was faboulus so tidy and clean the decoration as well is so modern. Toilet was big and its floor has a heating system. I go to so many fancy 5 stars hotels but I was quite uncomfortable as I felt the staff were way too formal. If you want to celebrate at your room by bringing balloons like i did this is not the place to do so.I brought some helium balloons wanted them to float up to the sealing but the hotel management didn't allow it and made me tie them to a chair in the room because as they say the fire alarm is too sensitive and will go on if the balloon touched it. Otherwise the place was really nice and I'll go again. The rooftop bar is a nice place for a drink especially in summer.,4,2018,02,22
206,Superb Breakfast!,HOTEL in a great location for walking around town - rooms lovely - nice bathrooms - staff very helpful - room service breakfast a must - comes in its own oven to keep warm - never had that before - even hot toast - fabulous! Mini bar a bit extortionate but that's Dublin !,5,2018,02,22
206,What a wonderful stay...,"I stayed over last night in The Marker hotel in Dublin.  This was an amazing experience.  The rooms were perfectly clean, every detail was looked after.
The friendliness of the personnel is remarkable.  This is a true 5 stars hotel on all points of view!",5,2018,02,21
206,#trulyfivestar :),"Extremely pleasant, courteous and professional staff. Facility amenities are truly 5 star! Concierge services are simply one of the best I have experienced at any hotel. The location was also perfect for me as it was walking distance for business and to the city center.  ",5,2018,02,20
206,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel with nice sized rooms, elegant bathrooms & great amenities such as the pool & sauna.  Quiet, comfortable, good service. The only thing is that the shower is very small and the pillows on the bed were not as high quality as the rest of the bedding. ",5,2018,02,20
206,Best hotel in Dublin ,Visited here for Valentine's but the weekend before it. We stayed in a Sunday night.  We had such a lovely time. By far my favourite hotel in Dublin.  The roof top bar want open as it was too cold but i think she said it opened in April. But id you  wanted pics they would allow access to it. The restaurant closed at 5.pm which was a bit of a let down. But we are in the bar which was nice. Great atmosphere. Excellent customer service. Spa was nice the only downfall wad there wasn't enough loungers to chill out on. But i enjoyed it was very relaxing.  Our room was spacious and comfy with lovely interior. Nice added bonus of underfloor heating with a nespresso coffee bar. We had complimentary champagne waiting in our room as part of the package. Not a lot around the hotel but all that we needed and nothing is too far away. The theatre is right across from the hotel. Will definitely stay here again perhaps in the summer when the rooftop bar is open. ,4,2018,02,20
206,"Classy hotel, great service.","Very attentive staff.  Bright, spacious and luxurious rooms with superbly comfortable beds! Impressive breakfast food and service - seated, self service buffet or a bit of both.  The pool and spa area are brilliant, the pictures didn‚Äôt do it justice. ",5,2018,02,19
206,Excellent Stay,"Just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel as we visited Dublin for our wedding anniversary. The service was excellent from every member of staff encountered from the time of arrival to when we left; each staff member was polite and friendly, and nothing was ever too much trouble. We were upgraded to a corner suite, which was furnished and equipped to a high standard, and no issues with cleanliness. The only slight  disappointments with the room were a lack of any bright lighting for reading and limited storage space. A lovely touch was the plate left in the room on our return from an afternoon out with some cakes and ""Happy Anniversary"" piped in chocolate. The pool was large compared to most hotels stayed in previously and the gym was well-equipped. The hotel was well-situated,  within about a 20/25 minute walk from the city centre.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,02,18
206,Great hotel and staff,"I surprised my now fianc√©e by taking her to the spa at the Marker which was fantastic and then booking a room without her knowing. The staff were fantastic, we felt very well looked after and would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2018,02,18
206,Great hotel when travelling on business,"The marker is conveniently located near all major tech companies HQs in Dublin. I always stay here when travelling for work. Great comfy rooms, amazing breakfast and excellent service overall. No hustle stay. ",5,2018,02,18
206,A bit too modern for me,Modern 4 star hotel- far too open the restaurants and foyer is - lacks a clear Irish welcome - however staff well trained and doing all they can - really looking fwd to this but was disappointed slightly - perhaps we will look for alternatives- but may well be back,4,2018,02,17
206,Absolutley Exceptional,"I recently stayed at the Marker on business. Both the friendly man with an umbrella outside and at reception made an excellent first impression, immediately making me feel at home. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The real highlight was the spa with steam room, sauna, jacuzzi, and pool accessible to all guests. Next time I'll be sure to book a treatment in advance. I've heard great things about the rooftop bar but wasn't able to check it out due to February weather. I travel to Dublin on business frequently and cannot imagine staying anywhere else.  ",5,2018,02,16
206,Hotel moderno e molto accogliente,"Hotel located in the new district not far from the white Calatrava bridge. Next to the concert hall. Very professional, kind staff. Very quick check-in, excellent non-smoking room on the second floor. Surprise very welcome: the marble bathroom floor  heated , with the winter weather in Dublin was very welcome. Fast room service for both lunch and breakfast. Clean, and fast chek out. I will definitely return to this hotel in Dublin.",5,2018,02,15
206,Mid-week break,Excellent hotel. Excellent throughout in all aspects. Spa facilities were extremely nice. It was also quite a quiet stay which we enjoyed. I would recommend staying here to anyone. Could not fault anything. It is a decent walk to the city centre but other than that...perfect.,5,2018,02,15
206,Gorgeous hotel with a great view,"One of the nicest hotels I‚Äôve stayed in,there was a wonderful view looking over the river as well as a less than 5 minute walk to get to the heart of the city centre, the staff were very friendly and accommodating as well as our room being very spacious and comfortable.",5,2018,02,14
206,The Marker Hotel,"Everyone was really nice and friendly, nothing was too much trouble, from when I arrived to when I left, Very close to the theatre and close to the centre, not too much traffic going passed, mainly taxis",5,2018,02,14
206,"Nice hotel, great location","The hotel was very nice and clean. The beds, shower and spa were fine. The location was great and the bus from the airport stops very close to it (at the corner of the street). The only thing I missed were hooks for towels and clothes in the bathroom. We had frontview so a bathroom with a shower only. The shower is great but I never like to put my towel on the toilet seat. A powerpoint next to the bed would make the room perfect.",4,2018,02,13
206,Weekend trip,"The Marker is extremely easy to get to and is beautifully positioned. It is within walking distance of Dublin City centre and a stones throw from the 3 Arena. This hotel oozes class. From the warm welcome and ease of check-in, it ranks along with some of the best hotels in which I‚Äôve ever stayed. The room was exemplary and although the Braserie was fully booked during our stay, the room service was excellent. We pre-booked the valet parking, and for the price, found it very worth while. When checking out, we were able to leave the car and check our bags so that we could explore the city further. Special mention must go to Vladimir who was so helpful every time we encountered him. Overall an exceptional weekend break made all the better by our surroundings.",5,2018,02,13
206,Fabulous hotel and location,This hotel is a real treat. The lobby and bar area are open spaces but comfortable. Dinner in the brasserie was tasty and reasonably priced and the room was very comfortable. Staff are very friendly and helpful ,5,2018,02,13

Highly recommend The Marker as a place to stay and this time we did get the service for the price. Well done to all the staff, felt very welcome.",5,2018,02,13
206,breakfast,we had a lovely Saturday staying at the marker however the breakfast was very disappointing paying ‚Ç¨ 57.00euro for breakfast and it was less than average avoid paying for this there are coffee shops just across the square the marker could take a lesson on breakfast from these shops,4,2018,02,13
206,Perfect business stay,"The Marker is the best hotel located in the business area at the docks of Dublin. The service is outstanding and remarkable, especially during breakfast time.

Hotel is modern but still has atmosphere and style.

Brasserie was closed due to refurbishment. Room service was ok; not remarkably good, but solid.",5,2018,02,11
206,Delightful,"What's not to like? Attentive team, great Architecture in a cool central location. Rooms are a good size with enough treats to make it feel like home. Under floor heating in marble bathroom was better than home & that's the buzz we want when away on a work trip. 
Artwork mediocre but everything else a five üåü

206,Fantastic stay at the Marker,I booked a surprise treat for my wife directly with the hotel. We received a complimentary upgrade to a corner suite which was absolutely fabulous. I had ordered some treats for the room which were there awaiting us on arrival. The bed was super comfie and the bathroom was incredible underfloor heating deep bath and separate shower. Room must have been soundproof as we didn‚Äôt hear a peep during our stay. Highly highly recommend The Marker for a bit of luxury for your getaway!,5,2018,02,07
206,Not a wow,An enjoyable weekend stay with a friend. Staff were accommodating and attentive. Breakfast was the only let down. Plates should be heated and the buffet was luke warm. It wasn‚Äôt a 5 star worthy breakfast. ,4,2018,02,06
206,"Excellent Accomnodations, Bar, and Satff","Checked in for a two-night day trip after reading Tripadvisor reviews.  20-minutes from Dublin Airport (30 Euro Cab for two - tip included).  Hotel was impressive.  Staff was efficient with no more than 5-min to register us ad wisk us away with the bellan who provided us with a guided-tour of the room and it's amenities.  Room was large, bathroom was luxurious with well-appointed soaps shampoos, cr√®mes, and lotions.

206,Modern hotel with old time courtesy,"The Marker is modern, stylish hotel set in the Docklands area, around 20 minutes walk from the city centre. It has all the amenities and comforts of an upscale hotel but the staff are exceptionally friendly and warm.
The rooms are spacious and well-fitted out, as are the bathrooms, and we were lucky enough to get a very early check in  when we arrived from an early flight..

That, was even better. The view out to the canal was lovely and the soaking tub in the room was appreciated. I was visiting on a busy weekend and when there was a line up to see the concierge the front desk staff jumped in to help and gave me exactly the information I needed with a great restaurant recommendation. The roof top bar was a scene with a wait but I also appreciated that as hotel guests they made way for us and found a table.",5,2018,01,26

206,AMAZING LaDrunch at The Marker,"On a recent visit to Dublin we hit The Marker Hotel for LaDrunch. This is a new concept, a cross between brunch and dinner.
On walking into The Marker there was a real WOW amazing decoration and a fantastic buzz.
All six of us sat down in the lobby and had the most amazing gin and tonics and also alcohol free cocktails.
We then moved to the restaurant for the main event......IT WAS SUPER. 
A great big table was eyecatching with drinks, ice sculptures and a DJ spinning the vinyl!!!
We had a great table, excellent service by cheery staff and the food was top class.
We ranged from stunning pancakes to fish of the day.  Top marks for everything.
Quiet pricey....but 5star hotel. We will be back!!!",5,2018,01,21

206,Best Dublin Hotel I've ever stayed in,I was in Dublin for a business conference - the Marker rate was higher than my budget but I decided to stay there for convenience. I'm so glad that I did. From the moment I arrived the staff were exceptionally friendly and well trained. I was told that my room wasn't ready but was given an upgrade to the most fabulous suite I've ever stayed in. I didn't want to leave it!!  I paid a visit to the Spa which was really quiet and relaxing. I ate in the Bar that evening and the food and service were really good. Buffet breakfast : great variety of hot and cold food. Conference ran off very smoothly and my pre booked taxi was waiting as arranged. For a 5 star hotel I can honestly say that the staff made my stay really special - they were friendly and professional. I would not hesitate to recommend the Marker  - it's was blowing the budget for the 5 star experience!!,5,2018,01,17
206,Fantastic Hotel,This is the best hotel we have ever stayed in. All the extra details make the hotel absolutely excellent- the staff are fantastic and we have stayed here twice and have already booked our next night- would definitely recommend ,5,2018,01,17
206,Perfectly situated for the perfect stay,The marker hotel has been the best experience from comfort to friendliness off staff it‚Äôs location gives you the freedom to have the haven off luxury and with a short walk the centre off Dublin‚Äôs hub off shopping and night life,5,2018,01,16
206,A treat if visiting the Bord Gais,"Couldn't get a better location for the Bord Gais:  Buses close by too / ‚Ç¨10 taxi ride to Grafton street. Very comfy beds.  We ate in the bar area - service was excellent, as was the food.  Drinks were a bit pricey;  Breakfast was good / above average - excellent service all round.",5,2018,01,16
206,Staff very attentive,"Staff very attentive, hotel clean and nice, spa a little lacking. Rooms were clean spacious and had plenty of facilities. Spa didn‚Äôt have enough seating area for no of users to hotel. And the area itself is lacking slightly compared to standard of hotel. ",4,2018,01,16
206,A Very Pleasant Stay,Stayed here about 2 weeks ago after a show in Bord Gais Theatre. Staff were exceptionally pleasant and room was very comfortable and modern. What a pity a nights stay is so expensive or else I would be attending the theatre night time shows much more often.  Would be great if they did a pre theatre dinner and overnight deal to suit people travelling up to Dublin from the country.,5,2018,01,14
206,Excellent,"I stayed at this hotel for an interview and it was an absolute pleasure. They were incredibly accommodating, plus the food at the Brasserie was exceptional. Very convenient location - short walk to Temple Bar too. Highly recommend. ",5,2018,01,14
206,2 nights,"The best thing about the Marker is it‚Äôs people. Dorian the waiter there was a true gent, authentic and helpful. It was lovely to see the friendship among the bar staff there also which is a great sign that the people running the Marker care enough about their customers to care for their staff. Hotel facilities, food, spa and service level were simply impeccable. Thank you for a memorable stay.",5,2018,01,13
206,Fantastic hotel!,It was a lovely break and a holiday that felt like a break. Fantastic facilities and lovely staff to help. We really enjoyed going down to the bar on an evening and enjoying the drinks and free snacks. Would love to go back during the summer to experience the Rooftop bar! ,5,2018,01,12
206,Fab hotel,"Had a fab 1 night stay for my husbands birthday, its the most beautiful hotel ever! They had birthday treats in our room for him.  The attention to detail is unreal. Loved everything about this hotel!!",5,2018,01,11
206,40th birthday stay,"We stayed for 2 nights for my husband's 40th and had a lovely weekend in Dublin. Check in was quick and efficient and we were upgraded to a larger room which was a nice gesture. The room was spacious and clean with a very comfortable bed. The bar area is the reason for 4 stars and not 5. As hotel guests I felt we should be able to have a drink in the bar easily however on return from our day in Dublin we struggled to get a table due to tables being reserved for guests having pre theatre drinks. We did manage to get a table and had a drink before the other people had arrived, meanwhile others were waiting for a table. This then happened again as we tried to have a drink before leaving the next night for our evening meal at Chapter One. 
Breakfast was good with a varied buffet but we did have to ask twice for juice as the waitress forgot the first time.
The walk into town took around 20minutes.",4,2018,01,11
206,Best weekend ever,"I hope heaven is as good as the hotel, it was one of the best places i have ever stayed at. The spa is really nice and clean, staff is perfect, room service just cant get any better. Will go back there for sure",5,2018,01,10
206,Nice touch!,"My wife and I rarely stay at any hotel more than once - apart from our favourite - Hotel Bon Sol - in Illetas, Majorca. However, having enjoyed a weekend break at The Marker in January 2017 we decided to return again this year. We were not disappointed. It was a nice touch that on arrival in our room we found a ""Welcome Back to the Marker"" plate of pastry and a note from the Management acknowledging our return. The staff are professional and courteous, the rooms quiet and comfortable, the quality and choice of food for breakfast is outstanding. The location is impressive and just a healthy walk from the centre of Dublin. I don't think this will be our last visit!",5,2018,01,10
206,A premium hotel but TOTALLY worth it,"This has got to be one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed at. The service is exceptional, rooms are beautiful and you really do get treated in a special, unique way.

Let's be honest, this hotel isn't cheap. It's a premium hotel. That being said, I've stayed in plenty of hotels that charge premium prices but don't deliver, which is when it really hurts you've paid top dollar. Not this one though, you pay a premium price but you will get an amazing stay.

Concierge when you first arrive - brilliant; check-in attentiveness and politeness - amazing; room size, cleanliness and appearance - sublime.

I stayed for 2 nights and it's the small things that really make a stay special; house-keeping being discreet but efficient. Hotel staff greeting you and wanting to help whenever they can. A clean and quiet corridor.   Etc.

I didn't get the chance to try the spa - I wish I had, I'm sure it is amazing! - and we ate out rather than in the hotel, so I can't comment on food. But the bar area is reasonably priced and spacious; open late too. We went for a ""superior room"" and it had a coffee machine, minibar, superking bed and massive bathroom (the heated floor is particularly nice), complete with separate bath and separate shower.

The walk to Temple Bar is about 20 minutes and along roads that are fine to walk along. If you get a taxi to Temple Bar / Trinity College then it would probably be about ‚Ç¨12-13, there is a taxi rank right outside too, which is handy. Taxi to the airport was ‚Ç¨26 (and I paid ‚Ç¨36 for airport pickup i.e. someone meeting you at arrivals).

As a side point, Dublin isn't somewhere that is cheap to go if converting Sterling to Euros; average pint ‚Ç¨6 and most things are 20% more expensive that they would be in a town in England. They're probably comparable to near-London prices, so I suppose that is to be expected.

A great stay - a big thank you to all the staff at the hotel for making it exactly that.",5,2018,01,09
206,Amazing,Amazing hotel with amazing staff everyone is so friendly and helpful from accommodation. .Spa. . Front desk .. bar. .and special from Brasserie. The treatment was fantastic and hotel deserves 6‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜüòÜ,5,2018,01,08
206,Wonderful city hotel,I would highly recommend a visit to The Marker Hotel and in particular the spa. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and the staff were so welcoming. A visit to the rooftop bar for cocktails is a must!,5,2018,01,08
206,The Marker,"Wonderful hotel, great location, helpful staff. Our 5th time to stay at The MArker and we enjoy it every time. The rooms are clean, great views of the Docks, love the bathroom, huge tub, great shower and heated floors.",5,2018,01,08
206,Fabulos,"I cannot recommend this hotel enough.  All of the staff were so nice.  A special mention to Hani.  The attention to detail is brilliant. The location is beautiful, we had a lovely view of the square from our room.   We look forward to our next stay at The Marker Hotel.  If you get an opportunity to stay here, grab it with both hands.  You won't be disappointed. ",5,2018,01,08
206,Pure Luxury,"Completely exceeded expectations from the modern hallways right through to the high end spa. All food, be it brasserie, room service or the bar was all delicious. I can't wait to stay again! Room was finished to a high end and heated bathroom floor is such a treat for cold winter toes! A home away from home!",5,2018,01,08

Massages were fantastic and the rooms are suitable for 5 stars
Thank you marker for spoiling us!
",5,2018,01,06
206,A lovely stay,"A nice room with a lovely bathroom, great facilities including a spa which is accessible to guests free of charge. Staff were amazing and were friendly, polite and helpful at every opportunity. Whilst the hotel is a walk from town it‚Äôs nice to be out of the hustle and bustle; 20 min walk or short cab ride to the centre or a 5 min walk to a train station. ",5,2018,01,06
206,Fantastic staff ,"The Marker has some of the best staff I‚Äôve ever encountered.   In particular, Barry and Robert went to great lengths to make sure we had an enjoyable stay, checking to make sure that sights were open (it was Christmas week when we visited) and making sure all our logistics were worked out.  Hotel itself has very nice roof bar and spacious, well appointed rooms.  One star off because the location is a bit off the beaten path ‚Äî a 20-30 minute walk or cab ride to the sights.   ",4,2018,01,06
206,Wonderful experience,We arrived on New Year's Day at 15.10.  Our room was not quite ready but the receptionist explained that was because of New Year's Eve and offered a complimentary drink while we waited for our room. After about 10 minutes the room was ready and we were handed our keys and was informed our luggage had already been brought to our room. Everything about the hotel for the two days stay was perfect. ,5,2018,01,05
206,A truly delightful stay,"We stayed for two nights across the New Year and had a really fantastic time. The service was impeccable, the room was wonderfully comfortable, breakfast was everything you could want (and more!) and the spa was excellent. Thank you everyone at The Marker for such an enjoyable weekend.",5,2018,01,05
206,"Modern, slick and relaxed atmosphere","We could not fault the stay, impressive service, rooms, food and location. Altogether slick. The only downside was the availability of decent local restaurants but this not a criticism since we are relaxed and could easily walk the 10-15 mins into the city for vast selection of pubs / restaurants.",5,2018,01,05
206,Modern stylish hotel in the new business area,Very comfortable modern hotel.  Close to the new business area and convention centre.  20 min walk into the main city restaurant/shopping area.  Helpful efficient service.  Good breakfast in the hotel restaurant.,5,2018,01,04
206,Fantastic Christmas Break,"We recently spent a night at the Marker over Christmas as part of a birthday celebration. On arrival we were greeted by a very pleasant concierge who swiftly took our bags and dealt with the car. The check-in staff were extremely helpful and informed us we had been upgraded as it was my birthday, within five minutes of arriving in the room a member of staff arrived with a birthday platter. 

The room was tastefully furnished with all the amenities one could ask for, not to mention a splendid view of the canal. At breakfast there were a wide variety of items available, each one as tasty as the next. 

We had a great time at the Marker and look forward to our return.  ",5,2018,01,04
206,New Years Day Break,Amazing hotel. One of the best I‚Äôve ever stayed in! The staff are a credit to the hotel and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Can not wait to return and stay again! I didn‚Äôt want to leave! ,5,2018,01,04
206,Night away break,"The hotel has excellent service and facilities. The only draw back was the pool and spa area. It is advertised as a place of tranquillity for adults, however it was full of very loud families ,cannon balls into the pool, men wrestling and toddlers in the jacuzzi. ",4,2018,01,04
206,Best Hotel in Deblin,"I have stayed in this hotel for the last 4 years over New Years Eve and I cannot fault the hotel at all. The service is impeccable, there when you need them but obtrusive at all. The Quality of hotel and the staff is the best I have experienced anywhere, if you are travelling to Dublin and looking for a top quality hotel look no further. It is a 10 minute walk from the center of Dublin but because of that, it is lovely and quiet",5,2018,01,04
206,New Years Eve - Spectacular ,"We first stayed here back in 2015 for the first and have returned on numerous with our last stay to celebrate New Years Eve. I described this hotel then as Sheer Utopia and my opinion hasn't changed if anything it's been enhanced on every occasion. 
To read a review below on 1st Jan which in any way questions the service this hotel provides is laughable. Never have I experienced a more professional friendly staff and that's across the whole hotel. They are superb. Right from my first email from reservations agent Dierdre who not only promptly responded but dealt with and reserved me into a fabulous corner suite. The breakfast is superb with so many continental and cooked options and you also have choice of ordering of menu. I couldn't fault one aspect of it. I would also like to highlight Karina who has waited on us now on numerous occasions and is an absolute asset to the hotel. She is so helpful friendly and truly delivers world class service with a smile. 
The hotel had a special reception on new years eve and offered all guests free champagne and canopes and it was a nice opportunity to meet and be greeted by Hotel manager Charlie Shiel. He can be extemly proud of the team he is managing and the positive professional mentality off all the staff in this wonderful hotel. 
 I also feel a special mention needs to go the rooftop security/manager - Derek. An absolute gentleman who truly nothing is too much trouble for and constantly going out of his way to ensure everyone enjoys their experience on the rooftop. 
The marker is always my preference of where to stay in Dublin and truly I haven't stayed in a hotel anywhere in the world that delivers not only a true 5 star experience but also delivers world class service consistently. 
I can't thank you enough for making New Years Eve celebrations so special and our stay such a wonderful experience. I just cant wait to return here. ",5,2018,01,03
206,Over priced,"Paid extra for a corner suite. There was a door that led to nowhere - I'm guessing it was somebody else's room on the other side. The view from the room was of the side of a building. Just completely over priced and I wouldn't recommend. Also, 30 euro to park your car for the night. Ridiculous. Staff were excellent though I must admit. ",2,2018,01,03
206,Sylvester in Dublin,we stay at the marker f√ºr NYE. It is a very relaxed and nice hotel. A little walkdistance to the temple bar and other Attractions. The room was big and very nice and clean. All Employees in the hotel are nice and friendly. I loved the cheddar cheese for breakfast ;-),5,2018,01,03
206,NYE in Dublin,What a wonderful hotel. The staff can not do enough for you and make it so personal. Never before has a hotel put on free champagne and nibbles meet and greet where all staff come and say hello and have a drink with you. ,5,2018,01,03
206,"Modern hotel with great food, service and atmosphere","Set in the new docklands redeveloped area, a 20 minute walk from the centre, this hotel is exceptionally well run with superb food and hugely attentive service. Stayed over the New Year and had an excellent tasting menu dinner in the Brasserie and consistently tasty and varied breakfasts. The gym is very well equipped and pleasant and the pool/sauna/jacuzzi area was very nice. Also offers a good spa, albeit we didn't use it ourselves.",5,2018,01,03
206,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel. Accommodating staff, welcoming arrival. Nice sauna / stream room. Pool area was unexpectedly noisy with children playing / jumping around, which unfortunately hindered a relaxing swim. But otherwise nice spa.",4,2018,01,03
206,New Year stay at The Marker,"The Marker is a top quality hotel.  We stayed for four nights, from 29th Dec to 2nd Jan, and every aspect was first rate. The quality of the rooms, the service, the food, everything.  The roof top bar and the spa are stunning.  It‚Äôs not cheap, but it‚Äôs difficult to fault. ",5,2018,01,02
206,Nice hotel,"Had a one night break here.  All really nice, spa treatments were excellent, dinner in the restaurant was very tasty.  Rooftop bar is great.
Disappointing experience at breakfast but overall a nice getaway.
",4,2018,01,02
206,Best Hotel in Dublin !,"We have stayed at many top hotels around the world. The Marker is the best hotel we have ever stayed at. All of the staff were so friendly and caring, truly impressive. Well done !! We will definitely return !!",5,2018,01,02
206,Excellent stay,"Fabulous Hotel in a lovely location which suited a we went to see a show.
I had a small gripe about the price of drinks but such is Dublin.
The Hotel, service and all the amenities etc.. were second to none.",5,2018,01,02
206,Festive break,"My husband and I have stayed in the Marker, for a number of years-always at the same time of year.
It never disappoints. Breakfast Staff, Concierge and Front Desk always very friendly.
They all seem to be very happy in their roles  They go the extra mile to make you feel like number one 
guest.",5,2018,01,02
206,Weekend break,"The restaurant was over priced as was most things in the hotel. The food was not great and cold.  The breakfast was good with a good offer.
My wife enjoyed the spa and the pool area was very relaxing. The rooftop bar was nice, but the cocktails where very strong. We found better cocktails in Dublin. ",4,2018,01,02
206,First class hotel,This is one of the best hotels in Dublin.  The staff were first class professionals.  The hotel is located near to the tech office headquarters (ex Facebook).  You are also a 10 min walk from the night life in Dublin.  There is a great roof top bar and a fabulous pool and gym.  I will definitely be staying at the Marker hotel upon my return visit to Dublin!,5,2018,01,01
206,"Poor Service, Long waits for food ordered at Lunchtime and Cold Coffee at Breakfast in the mornings",Overall the service level at this Hotel is very disappointing and one to avoid if you are looking for a pleasant stay. There are many other hotels in the city which provide a far superior experience at keener prices - try the Shelbourne. The saving grace for this Hotel is the location adjacent to the Bird Gais Theatre  if you're going to a show. However if you are going to a show at the Theatre I'd recommend staying at the Shelbourne and getting a taxi which overall will cost you less and much superior and enjoyable experience.,2,2018,01,01
206,Fabulous two nights!,"I loved this hotel the minute we pulled up. The location is cool and the architecture modern and hip. The lobby has a vibrant and lively feel without anyvpretention. Our room overlooked the canals and had a great view during the day and at night when the lights came on. The rooms are well designed and spacious. My favorite detail was the heated floor in the luxurious bathroom. We were in the pool/spa 3 Times and loved the eucalyptus steam room. We ate breakfast, lunch and dinner and enjoyed them all. We walked into city center and along the River Liffey. A wonderful stay and the only negative was that we had to leave. I hope to stay again someday. ",5,2017,12,31
206,City break Dublin,"A truly perfect hotel . The service from hotel staff was outstanding 
Room perfect with beautiful views across the dockland 
A visit to the roof top bar a must 
Within a 3 minute walk a selection of coffee brasserie s mini supermarkets and easy access to taxi and local hop on hop off buses
Easy to see why, The Marker has such a high standard reputation .",5,2017,12,31
206,Birthday trip to Dublin," Lovely hotel in new docklands area which is good but its proximity to new theatre means many non residents use bar and brassiere causing problems for residents gaining access or decent service.
Rooms fabulous but 2 big minus points are lack of wardrobe space and no USB port for charging phones tablets etc. Staff helpful and friendly. For sightseeing its about 25 mins walk from centre",5,2017,12,31
206,They treat you like a rock star,"My husband and I decided to really treat ourselves this Christmas, and had a night in the Marker, complete with overnight valet parking. Okay, this is an expensive treat, but the Marker is the place to have it. The rooms are quiet, big, and comfortable, and they treated us like rock stars. Room service after midnight was delivered with a smile (and the chicken curry was really very good, a far cry from the frozen pizza you normally get from room service after the kitchen closes). We didn't have to check out till noon the next day, and when we got back from our day in Dublin to collect our car, a very smiley young man escorted us to the car, sheltering us with a massive umbrella. We will definitely be repeating this experience.",5,2017,12,30
206,Loved it ‚ù§,Had a wonderful first stay at the Marker . Service was exceptional from all staff we met !  Our room was gorgeous and the bathroom amazing . We had an early evening drink on the rooftop bar which was lovely tho a tad chilly ....it is  Ireland after all !! blankets and heaters provided . Will definitely be back ,5,2017,12,30
206,midweek break,In general I found the hotel stay very enjoyable the staff were helpful and courteous. I very much enjoyed the food and the excellent manner in which it was served. I would also like to compliment the staff for the manner in which the rooms are presented.       ,5,2017,12,29
206,One Night Escape,"Delightful stay, lovely room, spa and treatments were amazing, rooftop and lobby bar were nice. 
On the flip side, pool could have been warmer and breakfast was ok, felt like it was an inconvenience and need more emphasis on gluten free.",5,2017,12,28
206,Christmas Getaway,"From start to finish it was a great stay.

The Valet Parking is a great service and reasonably priced at ‚Ç¨24 for the convenience of the service received. 
A complimentary upgrade to a Corner Sweet is always welcome although it was the first time that we didn't have a view of Grand Canal Dock - a pity -  but thats just personal preference. 
We were slightly aggrieved by the fact that the minibar was poorly stocked. Only two bottles of beer (and Peroni at that!) and two bottles of wine. Every other time we've stayed at The Marker, the minibar has been bursting at the seams with shorts, mixers, beers etc. 

The Spa, as always, was fantastic. The massage you get here is as good if not better than anything you'll get elsewhere. Never disappointing. Marta looked after me and was excellent. 

Room service was efficient, tasty and most importantly - still hot when it arrived.

Dinner at The Brasserie was excellent and we were happy to take recommendations from the staff for dessert. 

After dinner we went up to the Rooftop Bar for a nightcap where we were well looked after by Derek. It's a beautiful location with amazing views of the city. 
I did notice that one of my glasses had a bad crack and was sharp on the inside. The waiter seemed genuinely apologetic - although it wasn't comped. 

We had breakfast included in our room rate. I do feel that something like Eggs Benedict should be included in the selection available to us. Instead we were only afforded a Continental Breakfast or Full Irish Cooked Breakfast so as a result had to pay extra to have Eggs Benedict. 

Check out was quick and efficient and my car was waiting outside with a couple of bottles of water left for us. 
",5,2017,12,27
206,Marker,"Very nice hotel. Rooms are really nice. Staff are friendly.
Pool and treatment area is really nice. Rooftop bar has really nice views of Dublin.
Only problem we had on our visit was the breakfast was extremely slow and wrong orders twice. 

",4,2017,12,27
206,40th Stay,"Stunning hotel. Lovely rooms, spa pool could do with some extra decent  lounge beds. The pool water was cold!!
Most of the staff were lovely, apart from snooty female bar manager in the rooftop bar. She was rude and condescending towards us! ",4,2017,12,26
206,Proposal,Everything was perfect. The staff were so helpful when planning the proposal to my girlfriend and when it came to the visit they bent over backwards to make it special. Could not ask for more really. The whole staff were a well oiled machine and nothing was ever too much trouble. The food at the brasserie was the best we‚Äôve had and the rooftop terrace was romantic and a great experience. We received a complimentary upgrade to a Corner Suite which was stunning and well kept. Can‚Äôt wait to stay again,5,2017,12,25
206,Modern Convenience,"We enjoyed a 4-night stay at The Marker in December. The staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were well appointed and maintained, and the Basserie restaurant was convenient and delicious (we especially enjoyed the breakfast buffet)!",5,2017,12,23
206,Lovely stay after our wedding,"A bit of a walk from the city centre but surrounded by good bars and eateries. Staff pleasant and accommodating in general. Breakfast can be very busy however, and often difficult to get attention from staff. Overall a lovely break - despite bad weather.",5,2017,12,23
206,Excellent location,The hotel staff and facilities are fantastic. On the pricey side but Dublin is expensive. We would have liked to use the rooftop bar and wasn't made aware on booking that it was only open at the weekend,4,2017,12,22
206,CHRISTMAS,The Marker hotel is very modern and different. It is very clean and the service is good. Nothing is to much troutlets and the staff are very friendly.  Myself and my husband would stay here again it is ideally placed for Dublin City and the 3 arena!!!,4,2017,12,22
206,An experience!!,"My husband and I had tickets for the Christmas Concert in The Bord Gais Theatre. Our daughter treated us to a stay at The Marker. The hotel could not be faulted!!
The building was warm and welcoming. There was a buzz in the reception area. Our room was large, bed very comfortable. We noticed how quiet the bedroom area and corridors were. Plush carpet in the corridor meant we were only conscious of how quiet it was.
We had dinner prior to the concert. It was very reasonably priced. We had breakfast the following morning. What a feast!! All members of staff on both occasions were excellent, attentive but not fussing. They kept an eye on each table and were aware when extra coffee/tea was needed. Nothing was too much trouble.
Our daughter had occasion to request room service, which was prompt and excellent in general. 
I would highly recommend this hotel. It is very convenient to the Bord Gais and The Point concert venues. The area around the hotel is pedestrianized and lovely for a walk, or a rest on one of the many benches beside the canal to watch the world go by.",5,2017,12,21
206,I love everything about this hotel,"My most recent visit to the Marker was for a mid week lunch with my friend. The food was fantastic, the drinks went down well and the service was fabulous - attentive without being overbearing. I have eaten in the hotel previously and stayed over on one occasion. The room we had had was beautiful. I especially loved the underfloor heating in the bathrooms. Cost wise the food is reasonable, drinks aren't any more expensive than in other pubs and although the hotel is a little pricey (it is five star) it's better value than other hotels I have stayed in.",5,2017,12,21
206,Amazing Hotel in Ideal Location,This is a hotel I will definitely be returning to. Everything about the experience was exceptional from my parking up for valet to check-in. We were up for the Ireland game and the proximity to Aviva Stadium was perfect. Breakfast is also amazing there with a wide variety of choice.,5,2017,12,21
206,Fantastic location,"If you want to stay in the heart of the 'New' Dublin this is the place . The area is full of architectural gems and the hotel is one of them ! It's also walking distance to the historical centre and for those that want to cycle , dublin bicycles is at your door step !!",5,2017,12,21
206,Excellent,"Booked a room through hotel's own website ans we got upgraded with breakfast each morning. Had the corner suite and was so plush and comfortable. We had views of Bord Gais which was a real treat. Staff were amazing, food delicious and cocktails at the bar were delightful! Would highly recommend staying here. Also only a short work into the city centre, 3Arena or Bord Gais.",5,2017,12,20
206,The marker hotel -  5 star experience,"Amazing hotel, service, localization. 
The staff very accomodating and also we were very well received.
The room was very clean, the environment is great.
Restaurant with amazing food.
Roof top bar has a great view of Dublin.

Outstanding place, highly reccommend.",5,2017,12,20
206,Fantastic hotel,"A great stay at The Marker Hotel. Staff were friendly and welcoming and couldn't do enough for us. The spa was clean and tranquil. The roof top bar is very much worth a visit.We will definitely return!
",5,2017,12,19
206,Wonderful break,"Beautiful rooms. Comfy bed and pillows. Excellent staff. I was treated like a rock star. They added lovely personal touches to make our stay better. Very expensive for my normal budget, but it was worth it and I would stay again for a special occasion.",5,2017,12,19
206,Great,"Great hotel, staff really nice and friendly only the neighborhood is a bit quiet over the weekend. Our room was nice and spacious. But the best part is the pool!! Quiet and nice. so overal we had a great stay! we will definitely go back ",5,2017,12,19
206,21st Century Hotel Amidst the Old Feel of Dublin,"The Marker is a very modern, 4.5 star, vibrant and stylish place to stay and a welcome differentiator after touring old-style Dublin all day. 

It sort of sticks out among the rest of the city, and is located in a seaport area that seems to have a lot of newish buildings and tech companies moving in; basically a whole new part of the city being built. It is also near a performing arts and conference center, so is likely there to draw in business people.

I was there solo and just for fun, and having just stayed in a castle in Donegal, the newish feel of The Marker was perfect. As an American, this feels like a modern, boutique style place you'd find in NYC or San Francisco. It is very large and has a restaurant and rooftop bar, as well as a chic and bustling hotel lobby bar. 

It's kind of set away from the ""action"" so-to-speak of Temple Bar and Trinity, but I walked to each countless times in about 10-minutes. A cab ride would be 5. I actually liked this aspect of it being in a more modern area and one without too much of the riff-raff further into the city center. 

I enjoyed the pool and hot tub area the most. It is absolutely beautiful and relaxing...feel like your in some Japanese spa within a dark temple. I would go as far to say that it is not really appropriate for children; this is more like an adult style lounge, not where kids run around with beach balls, etc. 

The rooms were alright, nothing to plain about but nothing too impressive. Not really great views from where I am, and doubtful anywhere would have them aside from the rooftop bar. Service was good; I called ahead and told them I needed my car (all valet) at 5am and when I came down the next morning it was all ready for me. 

I would absolutely stay here again - no question.",4,2017,12,18
206,ALL the stars!,"A wonderful slice of luxury right around the corner - so it suited me just fine. Service is exemplary and spa facilities are perfect for relaxing after a hard day.
Very spacious room with an excellent view. Will definitely return.",5,2017,12,18
206,Excellent standard just outside the city centre,"Stayed two nights in the Marker. Modern, spacious room maintained to the highest standard. Excellent staff in all areas.  Enjoyed the Brasserie restaurant. All staff were friendly, courteous and professional with no hint of ‚Äòsmile training‚Äô.  
The location is a little removed from the city centre but it is a terrific place to stay or to eat if you‚Äôre attending the (Bord Gais Energy) Theatre next door. 
We‚Äôll definitely stay here again. Not cheap (where is in Dublin?!) but very good value given the high standards of facilities and people. 

",5,2017,12,18
206,Awesome ,"Great location near Facebook office. Spacious, comfortable rooms. Modern, clean feel. Very friendly service. Nice and quiet! The bathroom floors and towel rack are heated, which is a nice touch. Had a great view of the city. Free wifi. ",5,2017,12,18
206,"AMAZING,,,","I have stayed in the marker twice including this weekend .  On arrival your car is taken and parked . Booking in at reception is smooth . Staff are very polite and friendly . We stay in one of the corner suites . The bathroom floor is heated , bathroom is immaculate . The room has tea/coffee machine .

Thank you to all the lovely staff , see you soon xo",5,2017,12,17
206,Business stay,"I have travelled the world and staid in many top hotels over the years.this was my first time in Ireland and the hotel and both were fabulous. Great location. The staff were extremely helpful. I am not a big drinker, but I do have a favourite, but I can only usually find it in the Far East so was delighted to find it on draft in the bar (1664 blanc) this was one of a great choice on offer. ",5,2017,12,16
206,A very nice hotel,"Overall we were very pleased with our weekend stay. The location is not in the centre of Dublin but well within waling distance, but we neede to take a taxi back in the evenings. The taxi trips were slowed Down in the centre due to all the trafic lights.",4,2017,12,16
206,Perfect,Stayed here in December on business. Everything was perfect. Great staff. Great gym. Great room. It‚Äôs near enough to most stuff. For me it was close to work. I‚Äôd definitely stay here again on my next trip ,5,2017,12,16
206,Beautiful Hotel but Poor Breakfast ,"As soon as we got in the Taxi at Dublin Airport and said to the driver that we where going to the Marker Hotel his comment said it ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit special that Hotel‚Äù, I expected it to be a lovely hotel and it certainly lived up to the expectations!

Upon arrival we where greeted by a well dressed bell boy who helped us to checkin.

The hotel surrounding and decor was beautifully modern with plenty of sitting areas.

The hotel room was lovely too with a big bathroom with both a shower and a bath.

What didn‚Äôt make this hotel a 5 star for me was the breakfast.

It was a buffet type and whilst they had other options that you could order that where priced as extras, most people opt for the buffet.

In all reality there wasn‚Äôt a great choice and it‚Äôs probably the smallest selection that was on offer than virtually all the hotels I stay in.

The one thing that really gets me down is how chefs in hotels do bacon. It looks so un appetising and it‚Äôs all stuck together looking un cooked and looking like a good cobbler could make a decent pair of shoes out of them!

It was that bad that I had to pay for a different option. I did raise it with one of the managers and although helpful didn‚Äôt really make me feel my complaint was justified?

I opted for the eggs Benedict and it gave the impression in the menu that the products used where freshly made by the chef, but when I asked the manager she said that it‚Äôs the same bacon they used from the buffet? A bit of false advertising in my opinion.

When I get back to Dublin I would certainly stay in this hotel but would not opt for the breakfast and as there are plenty of eateries local to the hotel, it would make sense because this wasn‚Äôt the quality you would expect from a hotel of this quality!! 
",4,2017,12,15
206,Very well presented and staff are very good but just a few flaws,"Happy with my stay but found a few issues using the spa and getting comfortable in my room, expected more for the price I paid, would travel a lot and where I have been more than happy with the staff I just found the hotel just not have that finishing touches eg hypoallergenic pillows, bathrobes that are for men, less over priced item in rooms bar, and tv that didn‚Äôt crash if you tried to do anything other than watching normal telly eg YouTube would give it a 6 out of 10",3,2017,12,14
206,Stay in December 2017,"at $215 euros, things were getting high. Was told for my Feb trip there, rate is 259. I am cancelling my stay since I cannot have the 215 rate- which is already somewhat high. If you reduce my rate to 215, I would be back in Feb",5,2017,12,13
206,Great hotel... great service,"Thank you Marker.. wonderful hotel and stay! Staff exceptional... from check in to check out. Top marks. Stefan was so helpful, much appreciated. The breakfast was great and tastefully laid out. Love looking out at the nicely lit courtyard.. very pretty. Would recommend as a great spot ",5,2017,12,12
206,"Lovely hotel, Helpful staff","We stayed here for 1 night. We got back to the hotel late, we got soaked wet. The hotel provided fresh towels and toiletries to our room and we got room service. Was really appreciated! he floor in the bathroom is heated and there is a decent selection of music on the tv in the room.",5,2017,12,12
206,Spotless & Fantastic service,"From valet, door man to check in, it was a warm welcome. The members of the staff at the rooftop bar were making personal connections & they were knowledgeble about the menu. We were really looked after & the food tasted great. Sparkling Clean rooms and housekeeping did a great job in refreshing the room & turn down. However our used cutlery was not taken away. Lady at the Spa remembered me from the day before, & made personal connection. Fast & efficient check out by the night team. ",5,2017,12,12
206,Weekend break.,"Excellent hotel, excellent staff, need a little mote attention to vegetarian options in the restaurant..the spar and treatments where very enjoyable, nothing to much trouble in a fabulous atmosphere. The roof bar even in December was worth a visit.",5,2017,12,12
206,Hotel Review,"The service was excellent, staff were very friendly and helpful. I was staying in a deluxe room which I found ver basic. Also thought the car park was very expensive as we were staying as guests and there's a lot of free parking around the area.",4,2017,12,12
206,One of my all time favorite hotels,"Service and quality at The Marker is always amazing. The have such a great staff who's willing to go above and beyond. I especially love the rooms and the bathrooms - everything is in marble, and the heated bathroom floor is unmatched to any other hotel I've been in (though my experience is a little limited). Room service is great, and the housekeeping staff go out of their way to organize your items. Would recommend 1000% to anyone. ",5,2017,12,11
206,Marker  - good experience,Great and friendly staff. Felt very welcomed. Couldnt do enoigh for you. Great service. Good breakfast. Nice hotel. Room quiet so can get good dsleep. Fab location. Drinks ridiculously pricey. Will stay again. ,4,2017,12,10
206,Beautiful stay and easy working,It was an amazing time in Dublin in this hotel. I am looking forward to visit you again! The service was absolut outstanding and breakfast and lunch more than delicious. Thanks for a wonderful and sucessful time in lovely Ireland! ,5,2017,12,10
206,Midweek break,Excellent service from extremely friendly staff who were helpful throughout our stay. The location is fabulous we walked to town for shopping but then were near enough to walk to our show that night also! ,4,2017,12,09
206,A good stay,I chose this hotel based on proximity to the office.  I was there for three nights.  The service was good and the staff friendly.  I liked the decor and the room had everything I needed.  The bed was very comfortable.  Room service food was ok but not anything special - probably better options outside the hotel.  I would definitely stay here again.,4,2017,12,09
206,LOCATED IN THE OLD DOCK AREA BUT IT IS A FIND AND  MODERN,"We booked this even thought it looked off the beaten path from downtown Dublin but it was the right choice. Right from the numerous contacts the hotel made with us 2-3 months prior to our stay:  our experience  was even better. One of the best staffs of any hotel. Young and energetic. Great rooms and location. We could go outside and sit on the canal benches and watch. Food was great, the help by each staff member was genuine. All seemed like they wanted you to have a good time.  We did. From the f rooftop cafe to the sidewalk bar. When we return to Ireland and we will. We will be at the Marker.",5,2017,12,08
206,Very Enjoyable Trip,Great experience in a top of the range hotel. Very peaceful at night in the room and the spa and pool area were very relaxing. May not be the cheapest but worth the money to treat yourself in modern luxurious surroundings ,5,2017,12,08
206,I love this hotel,"I love this hotel - they don‚Äôt cut any corners on service, food quality or interior design. As a resident, I was in and out of this hotel almost every day. Here is a list of my pros and cons for future visitors. 

Pros
- Clean, modern and high spec. 
- Located in a quieter corporate area of Dublin, yet still in walkable distance to the city center.
- The spa is wonderful and private.
- They serve drinks in all the appropriate glass wear. I also liked their use of large wine glasses.
- Their roof terrace bar is the best in Dublin. I‚Äôve celebrated my Birthday up there.
- Staff are attentive.

Cons
- It‚Äôs not a guarantee that you‚Äôll be able to get up to the roof terrace bar, so phone in advance to avoid disappointment. Note: the lack of guarantee is because it‚Äôs regularly booked out for private parties, or else the bad weather and time of year can cause it to be closed.
- The swimming pool is quite small (for swimming enthusiasts) and sometimes there are swim instructors doing private lessons in there.
- Drinks are on the expensive side so be aware that it‚Äôs easy to spend a lot of money, during a short period of time, at this bar. The bottom line is not to come here if you‚Äôre sensitive to price. ",5,2017,12,08
206,A Great Stay in Dublin,"Our experience at the Marker was fantastic from check in to check out. 
The location is within walking distance of all of Dublin, and we managed to 
see most of what we intended. 
We will definitely be booking again!",5,2017,12,07
206,Incredible!,"The staff were amazing, hotel facilities were fantastic, I couldn‚Äôt recommend the hotel enough! Everywhere was clean, the bed was comfy, the spa was amazing and I highly recommend the rooftop bar, the views were incredible. ",5,2017,12,05
206,Weekend trip to Dublin,"We stayed at the Marker at the start of December and while certain aspects of the hotel were very nice such as the spa area and rooftop bar I feel as a hotel in general it is highly over rated and the price point at certain times of year does not match the value for money , especially when compared to some five star hotels in County Kerry. Breakfast is mediocre at best , a rushed experience where our plates were removed before we were finished. Tea& coffee and toast were brought immediately and were cold by the time we had finished our cereal. The cooked breakfast was very poor to say the least. The pool area sauna and steam room is one of the highlights of the hotel . ",3,2017,12,04
206,Fabulous ,"Stayed here for one night while attending a show in Bord Gais. Parking is hassle free as the concierge parks for you. Check in was excellent with staff being so professional, helpful and chatty as all staff were throughout our entire stay. Rooms are spotless, spacious and luxurious. Bathrooms are fab with a huge shower. A trip to the rooftop bar on the 7th floor is a must, a little pricey but what would you expect for where you are and the exceptional views! Ate bar food after the show which we enjoyed immensely washed down with a bottle of Chardonnay. Beds were so comfy and no noise the next morning ensuring we had a lovely rest. Definitely will visit again should we attend another show forgetting to mention that the hotel is located about two minutes walk away from the theatre. ",5,2017,12,04
206,A Birthday treat,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Marker hotel.The staff were all so friendly and helpful and the room was spotlessly clean and comfortable.We were celebrating my birthday and it was a lovely surprise to get birthday greetings written on a plate with brownies .We had not prebooked a table in the roof top bar but the staff made every effort to accommodate us and we thoroughly enjoyed our drinks there before our early bird meal which was delicious.All in all it was a very pleasant experience which we hope to repeat again in the near future.,5,2017,12,04
206,Nothing is a problem !! ,Just returned from 2 nights in the hotel as the caption says nothing‚Äôs is a problem from reception to Bar to room service to the doorman and to top it off Fernando he‚Äôs the biggest asset to the hotel top class service from him any requests will be dealt with ASAP thank you so much for relaxing break before Christmas we will be back room 233 ,5,2017,12,04
206,Excellent mini break,"We had a lovely Corner Deluxe Suite - it gave us lovely views over the square and water.  Very quiet, comfortable and beautifully maintained. The staff were welcoming, friendly, helpful and well informed.  Nothing was too much trouble.  They even left cake for my husband's birthday",5,2017,12,04
206,Contemporary well situated hotel,"Friendly staff, fun ambiance, good location. The hotel rooms were quiet and the staff very helpful. The location is a bit out of the way but an easy walk. The rooms were clean and well presented. It was a nice place to come back to!",5,2017,12,04
206,Rock Solid,"I stay at a hotel like this for the service, cleanliness and comfort. The Marker did not disappoint. The stay wasn‚Äôt perfect but I don‚Äôt really expect perfection. Any issues were addressed promptly and with a smile. What more do you want? ",5,2017,12,03
206,Drinks ,Popped in with friends for drinks after a show. Bar service and ordered pink gin which was brought to our table along with some fancy tasty nibbles. Drinks delish but were pricey but we were treating ourselves! Hotel is lovely modern and is chic.,5,2017,12,03
206,Love love love,"This is my favourite hotel to stay in Dublin! The rooms are bright and fresh and modern. I love the Malin and Goetz products in the bathroom.. breakfast is perfect. The highlights being the wonderful spa and rooftop terrace with a gorgeous view of Dublin on a sunny day. It‚Äôs subject to weather so not always luck to get a chance to go there. They outdo themselves with service! 
I wish I could give it 6 stars   üåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü",5,2017,12,02
206,"This is complicated. It's the ""Hollywood"" hotel in Dublin.","There's no doubt this is a high-end hotel, BUT...

The Marker is considered a ""5-star"" hotel, and as such, has a significant standard to live up to. It is not inexpensive. It is not in the most convenient part of the city, therefore it better be good. 

Well, turns out it is. Good. Quite good in fact. Unfortunately, I was expecting better.  

The big plus at the Marker is the service. Extremely attentive. From the moment you arrive to the moment you depart. Exquisite service. Unparalleled in the city, in my opinion. The spa is fantastic as well. Gorgeous.

After that, you have an open-architecture hotel with decent food, decent rooms, and a decent location. Nothing remarkable at all. The bathrooms are very nice (I would hope so), and there's a nespresso machine in the room (as well a noteworthy rhubarb soda in the minibar), but beyond that, the rooms are reasonably small, there are are no USB charging ports, and the corporate-like views are typically pretty mediocre. 

The biggest thing about The Marker is that it's missing the quintessential Irish charm that Dublin oozes everywhere else I've stayed. It reminds me of many hotels in Los Angeles. The Standard. The Viceroy. Young and trendy, dark hallways, house music in the elevator. 

Fine indeed if you're in LA, or Miami Beach.  And maybe for YOU, it's perfect.  For me, I really appreciated the service, but expect a luxury hotel in Dublin to have more Irish charm.",4,2017,12,02
206,Very stylish... good service ,"Stayed here for one night on a business trip. Was upgraded on arrival which is always nice. Room was great, especially the bathroom. Comfy bed. Sleek decor in the hotel. Breakfast was fantastic. Only slight downside was the spa but after making a complaint they resolved the matter in a fair way. Would definitely stay again. Great hotel!",5,2017,12,02
206,Fantastic hotel ,"You are made to feel welcome on walking through the door.  The hotel is well designed and bedrooms are lovely.  Very comfortable bed.  Staff very pleasant and looking to take care of your every need.

Myself and the other guests will definitely be returning a really gem of a hotel right in the heart of the city

206,By far the best hotel experience I have had in Dublin,"Great hotel, amazing staff, location is a tiny bit outside if city center but you can be easily on any major street within a 15min walk. My second time staying and it will not be my last. Amazing check in and check out. ",5,2017,11,28

206,Pity about the breakfast,"This is our second stay in the Marker and for the second time the breakfast was practically cold, which is a pity because the hotel apart from that is fabulous. Everything about the hotel is class, the staff, the cleanliness and the level of service are as good as any hotel I've ever stayed in so please sort out the breakfast!",5,2017,11,28
206,"Marker Hotel, Dublin","If you are looking for comfort and something a little bit different when staying in Dublin, try the Marker Hotel. Yes, it is a little bit pricier than other hotels, but it is worth it for the room and especially the bathroom....they're amazing. Fantastic breakfast too and a great location to walk into the centre of Dublin, but be far enough away to be away from the crowds.",5,2017,11,28

The rooms are large with great view, WiFi and good shower/bath.

We used the spa and pool which were excellent.

I would definitely recommend and we'll likely be returning. Booking directly through the hotel website gains extras in their deal, including breakfast and room upgrade.",5,2017,11,27
206,Wonderful hotel,We loved the Marker hotel!  Staff amazing and rooftop bar was wonderful!  The room was large and well appointed.  A special plus was the heated bathroom floor.  Every member of the staff made us feel welcomed.  We will return!,5,2017,11,27
206,Earlybird,"I had eaten in The Marker several times previously but never before in the restaurant. This was a pre-concert (3 Arena) dinner with my wife. We were one if the first in at 17.15pm, but it soon filled up with other pre-theatre eaters (Bord Gais Theatre is right next door).

We chose from the a la carte menu, but there was very little difference between it & the early bird. A great variety was on offer. I can‚Äôt remember now exactly what we had but I clearly recall the quality of taste and presentation of both of our meals. Super. The deserts I wasn‚Äôt so fond of, mainly on appearance, as they appeared bland in color. My wife thought that they both appeared & tasted superb. Just goes to show that taste is individual.

Service excellent & very personable and unobtrusive. Pricing is good value. Location, decor & ambience is really good.

One of our favourite  eating & drinking locations in Dublin. 

You you must try the roof top bar on a summers afternoon or evening too. ",5,2017,11,27
206,Business trip to Dublin,"Very good hotel with great stuff. The buildling itself is very modern and the athmosphere is somewaht 'cold'. Rooms are well equipped, impaeccably clean and rather big. The floor heating in the bathroom is very nice. Only negative point about the rooms: the airco is quite noisy. I have not tried the spa, but heard it is quite nice. The gym in not big but has pretty much everything one needs for a workout after work. The best about the Marker is the staff. They are extremely friendly and helpful. 
 ",5,2017,11,25
206,First rate stay,"The Marker is a great hotel, in a new, trendy part of Dublin (Docklands), very convenient to the Dublin Convention Center (5 minute walk).  Also next door to the theatre. Really enjoyed my stay--definitely will return!",5,2017,11,24

206,Top class hotel,"Easily the best hotel I've stayed in and well worth its 5 star status. Gorgeous place and well situated in a nice part of Dublin city, with an incredible spa and pool. Main thing that made me write the review were the terrific staff across the board. Checked in by Sabine who was extremely pleasant, professional and helpful with everything. We had dinner there and service again was brilliant by Mario and also Diana who we both fell in love with! I think it was Natana who served us for breakfast and she was also brilliant. All in all an excellent spot that was even further improved by the amazing staff!",5,2017,11,24

Would definitely stay here again for business or pleasure.",5,2017,11,23
206,Marker Hotel Dublin,"Second time at the Marker. Overall very good, as usual. Excellent location for Docklands area and attractions. Short walk into town (around 20 minutes) for town centre locations and attractions. But if you can't walk too well then reliant on taxis/public transport etc.",4,2017,11,23
206,Respite,"Excellent opportunity to have a rest.  Very quiet.  Staff excellent.

206,A fabulous stay!,"The Marker Hotel didn't disappoint in terms of the staff, the service and the food. Everyone was so friendly without being over friendly. The food was fabulous in the bar and the breakfast was amazing. The starters in the bar were probably a little pricey for what they are but they were very tasty. The bedroom was perhaps a little bare but was so clean and very well maintained. The bathroom was fabulous! I loved the under floor heating and the shower. The pool was magnificent but a little cold for me! I also felt the bar area was a little cold. The rooftop bar is worth a look and Kevin was a fantastic host!",4,2017,11,22
206,Dirty Bedding,Dirty Bedding and was not cleaned even when this was highlighted to the staff. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and for the price I expect a lot better standard. Other than that I did enjoy my weekend in Dublin ,2,2017,11,22

Our room was extremely comfortable with all the necessary facilities and every member of the hotel staff that we dealt with were professional, courteous and accommodating.  Would highly recommend this hotel together with its great location in Dublin city.",5,2017,11,21
206,Lovely weekend away,Fab stay in The Marker. Lovely Docklands area and great service. I recommend the valet parking and the roof top bar was lovely too. I think during the summer months it would be absolutely amazing. I recommend this lovely modern hotel to everyone!,5,2017,11,21
206,Lovely stay!,This hotel was a lovely experience from start to finish. Every employee that we encountered was friendly yet professional. Rooms are beautiful and very comfortable. Bathrooms are huge and gorgeously designer.  We had food in the Bar and it was really nice. I would say that the rooftop bar wasn‚Äôt as fantastic as it‚Äôs promoted to be but it was at night so might be beautiful during the day. Overall highly recommend and would definitely stay again! ,5,2017,11,21

206,"Good location (for business), but Form Over Function and noisy rooms","If you are in the area for business, or a conference, then this is decent place to stay, but keep in mind that the Temple Bar area is a stiff walk.

Regardless, the hotel looks a bit cold and clinical, but that is down to personal taste. The staff was very friendly and we didn't use the bar or restaurants. The wifi is included in the price and works well, something that other hotels can learn from.

There were some problems with the room. There was very little storage space for clothes (we were there for 5 days), there are no power outlets near the bed (to charge devices) and the room was extremely noisy. We could sing along with our neighbours' Barbara Streisand marathon, wake up with their 6am alarm, listen in to conference calls and follow 'other activities' like they were in our room. The culprit - I am sure - was the connecting door between the rooms, it had no sound insulation at all.

So yeah, it is what it is. Not bad, not great, but fine.",3,2017,11,20
206,Fantastic 5 star experience,"Wonderful weekend stay for my fianc√© and I. Great food, service and facilities. Sauna and steam room highlight if the spa, not busy at all and the concierge team bent over backward to accommodate us, including some cake on arrival for my fianc√©s 30th! Would recommend, great base to explore Dublin! ",5,2017,11,20
206,Comfort and style,This docklands hotel has an energy and buzz while offering all the comforts of a good five star hotel. Staff are friendly and helpful and the pool and rooftop bar are unexpected treats. Position is excellent for a visit to Dublin for work or play.  ,5,2017,11,20
206,Perfection ,"Stayed at the Marker while visiting Dublin recently and was thrilled with the overall experience. The attention to detail at this hotel was excellent, from the quality of the wonderful drinks served by Gary and Dev in the bar (both absolute gents) to the beautifully equipped bedrooms to the excellent massage from Lorena in the spa which included hot towels and heated slippers! The room service breakfast was also top notch. Scrambled eggs cooked to perfection, everything beautifully presented and spotlessly clean. There was even two bottles of water sitting in our car when it was delivered back to us! Hats of the the team at this super hotel. They think of everything. Book this hotel, it's  excellent in every way. ",5,2017,11,19
206,Jetlag compensation,"Arriving from a USA trip we were all happy to stay in this comfortable Hotel.
The staff was very helpful and quick in the actions. No Long lines at check in or out.
All over a perfect hotel for business and Holidays.
",5,2017,11,19
206,"At last, the perfect hotel!","I‚Äôve traveled around for decades now and stayed on nice hotels and not so nice. Almost every time it‚Äôs been something or other that is not to my expectations. But the quest is over! The Marker hotel in Dublin is just perfect! Everything was to or over my expectations! From the friendly welcome at the door to the manager wanting to know if we were satisfied when I left the hotel.

The lobby is big and spacious. The check in fast and friendly. The room was big and well equipped, the bathroom with a tub and a big walk in shower, and with heat in the floor, just like at home. 

You could choose between a Wi Fi all over the hotel, or an encrypted one in the room. And of course a newspaper at our door in the morning.

The concierge was very helpful. He found us a nice restaurant for our farewell dinner (Shanahan's on the Green) and of course made the necessary reservation for us.

The breakfast was very plentiful and tasty (as usual in this part of the world you pay extra for the breakfast - ‚Ç¨15 per person per day).

The hotel has a big spa with a swimming pool. We did not try it, but it looked very nice. There‚Äôs also a roof terrace, but it was too cold to try it out.

The hotel‚Äôs location is great. A short walking distance from everything, and the airport express bus stopping 300 meters from the hotel.

A very nice experience that I would not hesitate to recommend to my friends!

PS: In many ways the Marker hotel reminded me of the Mark hotel in New York. Maybe some connection here?",5,2017,11,18
206,A great theatre hotel,"This is a fantastic hotel with staff very friendly and helpful. Situated about 50 metres from the Bord G√†is Theatre if a theatre break is what you are after. The hotel has a 44 metre swimming pool, large Jacuzzi, steam room and sauna plus treatments are available in the spa area. Food is served in the restaurant or in the bar in the evening along with a rooftop bar.  This hotel is within a 15 minute walk from Connelly Street train station and is about 1 mile from Grafton Street, the main shopping area. Taxis are always close by for transport and can be arranged through the hotel. This is one of the best hotels that my wife and I have stayed in and we are returning next summer with our family. Already looking forward to this.",5,2017,11,17
206,Great Experience,We had a very enjoyable stay in this hotel while we were in Dublin.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  The whole hotel was very clean.  The location was ideal.  We would recommend this hotel for anyone to stay at. ,5,2017,11,17
206,Great for a couples night / birthday treat,"Hotel was amazing with amazing views from our room. Everything from check in to check out was smooth. We arrived and parked outside hotel and concierge was straight over to take our bags and then park the car for us. Room was very clean and staff were a credit to the hotel. The little details all about the hotel were great added touches. The rooftop bar looked awesome but unfortunately we didn't get going to the rooftop bar which we would have loved to but didn't get the opportunity. We will make a point to go again. Thanks to the staff and The Marker Hotel, highly recommend!",5,2017,11,16
206,Great Hotel,"Excellent hotel - very repeatable experience!  Staff are friendly and efficient!  Facilities are excellent!  You won‚Äôt be disappointed!

Try the rooftop bar no matter the weather.  The pool is gorgeous.

You are never just a number in this hotel!",5,2017,11,15
206,Two couples overnight in the Marker Hotel before attending a show,An amazing hotel from the first step we took inside the door. The reception greeting at check in was so friendly and efficient. . The rooms are really lovely and so upmarket with all you would need to enjoy a lovely night here. The bar food and ambience in the hotel is really nice. The breakfast the next morning was delicious with an amazing selection to choose from. Would definitely recommend The Marker Hotel for anyone looking for a special place to stay in Dublin and within easy walking distance to the city.,5,2017,11,15
206,Marker Hits the Mark,"Not only is the Marker a well designed hotel, it is maintained to near perfection in terms of appearance and sound organization by knowledgeable and helpful staff who really understand the essence of attentive, top class service. There is an ease and comfort here, indeed a calmness that is conducive to a relaxing break.  The staff also know the City and their suggestions were all on target. Yes it is pricey but you get real quality. We spent four busy days in Dublin and the Marker proved to be a super base of operations during that time. After events and darting around the city, we'd return to the oasis that is the Marker. ",5,2017,11,15
206,excellent luxury hotel,"beautiful rooms, great location - a marvellous hotel. Absolute 5 star service - wonderful staff.
The pool and spa area is magnificent. Situated near the Grand canal dock - quiet at night for a good night's sleep, yet only 5 minutes by cab or 15 minute walk into the city. Our favourite hotel in Dublin.",5,2017,11,15
206,Fabulous Hotel,I was lucky enough to win an overnight stay at the Marker Hotel. Hotel and staff were amazing. Drink prices a bit too pricey. Rooftop bar is lovely. Pretty central to city centre. Overall a lovely experience. ,5,2017,11,14
206,Marker hits the mark,"Highly recommend, well-appointed stylish rooms with plenty of space. The food was superb, we ate from the pre-theatre menu which was excellently priced. Wine list was decent and the bar delivered some lovely cocktail, the Marshmallow Martini was a favourite of my wife‚Äôs. The Pool was really stylish, and the gym had all the equipment you would expect in a 5 star hotel. From the moment we arrived the staff were very professional and welcoming. The hotel is well situated about a 10 min walk from the hustle of the centre of town. Next time I‚Äôm in Dublin the Marker will get my business.",5,2017,11,14
206,Weekend trip to Dublin,"I'd been given tickets for the Ireland V South Africa game as a present for Father's Day and we used this as an excuse to book a night in The Marker. This wasn't our first trip to the hotel, and while it's certainly not the cheapest hotel to pick, in my opinion it is one of the best. My wife and I live this hotel and the attention received and standard of service from we arrived at the front door until we left could only be described as excellent. The food in the restaurant both for dinner, and breakfast the following morning was as good as we expected it to be, and the cocktails on the Saturday night weren't bad either. The hotels facilities, gym and spa are well appointed and spotlessly clean - just a shame we hadn't a bit more time to stay around a bit longer. We will be back again! ",5,2017,11,14
206,Mrs M,"An amazing hotel, the staff were all so helpful and welcoming, the food was amazing especially the breakfast, The rooftop bar and spa facilities were great. I will definitely be returning for another weekend break",5,2017,11,14

206,Excellent hotel with great service,"Great service and hotel, a bit on the expensive side, but well worth it. Especially good for business trips and visiting Google and Facebook that is just in the neighborhood. Good breakfast and very nice rooms",5,2017,11,13
206,Great Stay!,"I had a great stay at The Marker Hotel in Dublin.  Very efficient and friendly and nothing too much trouble.  Great room, great food, great night's sleep.  The spa looked fantastic but I didn't get to use it - hopefully, I will next time!",5,2017,11,13
206,Amazing stay,Loved our stay in the Marker. From the moment we came in we got top class service from the staff. The room was lovely and bed was very comfortable. We got an upgrade on arrival which was nice. We used the spa and it is brilliant and a really nice place the relax. The setting is lovely. The rooftop bar is also a nice spot for a few drinks and they give you blankets when it's cold. The cocktails were very tasty. We had breakfast and there was lots of choice. It's a short walk or cheap taxi in to the centre. Tip - book direct with the marker as it's as cheap and you get a complimentary upgrade if available and breakfast included. ,5,2017,11,13
206,Great experience,"The Marker is in an amazing location with great service from the employees. I'd highly recommend staying here. The best part? Their bathroom floor heater, especially for someone who is not used to the cold in Ireland. ",5,2017,11,13
206,"very modern, friendly and service oriented hotel","my stay was for business reasons, so the location was perfect (i.e. quick access to airport and business). For visiting Dublin I can imagine other alternatives. The hotel being new has large comfortable rooms with good facilities. If I really ""nitpick"" I would ask the hotel to make the steam room hotter in the SPA. I was very positively surprised by the general quality of service and attentiveness. I had no expectation of the food in the Bar but it was actually quite ok. The staff and management know what they are doing. ",5,2017,11,13
206,Pre-theatre visit,"Every time we have visited The Marker for dinner before the theatre, its been absolutely delicious. Our most recent visit, before Miss Saigon, did not disappoint; the curated cocktail was fabulous and the menu amazing. I recommend here to everyone for a wonderful meal before a show.",5,2017,11,12
206,superb,"from arrival to the check out customer service reception team food and beverage team all very professional. Our room very spacious bathroom complet marble and heated floor complimentary of very good quality coffe and tea in the room. 
We met GM Mr. Charlie shiel a true professional gentelman. He certainly leading a brilliant team and a great product. Superb food in the restaurant compliment to the chef he bring some great flavours together and create some beautiful dishes. Pity in Dublin no one eat in the hotel, I certainly would recommend to eat in the hotel restaurant you won't be disappointed. Also their wine list is not expensive as any other fine dining restaurants. 
we will be definitely back.
Just to describe with one word... it is SUPERB!!!
Thank you to all the team to make our stay so enjoyable.

206,Top Top Hotel,great room in a superb location for anyone looking to explore Dublin City Centre. Its reputation is merited as the overall service is of an outstanding level throughout the hotel. Wifi is great and room service was delivered in a timely fashion.,5,2017,11,10
206,A great place for a stopover in Dublin,"We experienced a warm welcome from the second we stepped onto the property - from the doorman who led us directly to the front desk, the front desk staff who showed us the amenities of the room right on to our easy check out and the hailing of a cab. We ate in the restaurant for both breakfast and dinner - everything quite good. 

Beds were comfortable, good wifi, lots of tv channels, huge (HUGE) bathroom, I really loved the peppermint shampoo. Great all around.",5,2017,11,09
206,Super service at the Marker,"Wonderful Saturday night stay.  There was a little delay in getting our room but the hotel delivered us to our dinner engagement in the courtesy car to make up for it.  Excellent service!  Everything else; room, breakfast, swimming pool was fab.",5,2017,11,09
206,Fabulous 6 days at the Marker.,"A fabulous 5 star hotel that deserves its fine reputation.  We found the staff to be particularly helpful on issues of sight seeing and the best ways to get around Dublin.  We particularly enjoyed a side trip to Howth, made so convenient by the train from Grand Canal station.",5,2017,11,09
206,"If you only stay at one hotel in your life, this is the one!!","The Marker is PERFECTION every sense of the word ~ from the simplest detail to the most complex. Staff, service, food, kindness ~ it was all above expectations. This hotel sets a new standard for customer-centered thoughtfulness and professionalism. Please understand, we are an average retired couple so we are prudent in paying 5 star prices. But we will NEVER hesitate to spend our hard-earned money at The Marker. It's simply the best of the best ~",5,2017,11,09
206,One of the best hotels in the world,"We‚Äôve stayed at a few hotels in our time for work and pleasure, but The Marker has all of the favourite features in one fantastic hotel. 

The warmest of welcomes greets you from the front of house team and from any staff member that you see during your stay. A check in that is really focused on its customers needs and not the check in process and where nothing is too much trouble. 

Our room (superior double) was really big. Very high ceilings, best and most comfortable bed ever, modem facilities and a large and well equipped bathroom. A real highlight. 

The hotel spa was another highlight. A long and narrow pool, steam room (with a lot of steam!), sauna and a large walk-in jacuzzi. The whole of the mezzanine floor is dedicated to the spa and treatment rooms. Highly recommended. 

We also used the bar as well as roof terrace that were well maintained and reasonably priced. 

Loved the hotel and look forward to returning. ",5,2017,11,08
206,Five star amenities and treatment,A wonderful hotel in great location with superlative staff and service. Beautifully appointed rooms with one or two things requiring tweaking like main lighting and bathroom accessories. Mini bar expensive.,5,2017,11,08
206,Nice break,"My wife and I stayed two nights over the October Bank Holiday weekend. enjoyed it very much. statf are very attentive. very contemporary hotel. rooms are excellent, very quiet. rooftop bar is very funky.

206,Modern Hotel in Dublin,I really enjoyed my 4 night stay at the Marker.  The location was convenient and the room was well decorated.  My favorite was the bathroom was large and like a spa.  I would highly recommend.  All amenities of a elite hotel.,5,2017,11,07
206,Top marks for The Marker,"This is a beautiful hotel, very modern but with real style and old fashioned excellent service. All staff we came in contact with greeted us in a professional, friendly manner and dealt with any queries efficiently.  Only 2 regrets, we didn't book a treatment and didn't eat in the Brasserie due to other commitments but we fully intend to return to this fabulous hotel so will do both these things. ",5,2017,11,07
206,"Convenient Location, Excellent Facility","I spent a week at the Marker while on business in Dublin.  
The staff was excellent, even accommodated me with an early check-in because my flight arrived in the early morning.
The location was great and we were able to walk to a different pub and restaurant each evening for dinner.  
The huge tub and separate shower were a plus.",5,2017,11,06
206,"Beautiful hotel, luxurious rooms","Our stay at The Marker Hotel was wonderful. The hotel is stylish with a great roof top bar serving tasty cocktails. The rooms are luxurious and so comfortable. This hotel is exquisite and clean. The spa was relaxing with an excellent sized pool. 
Breakfast was lovely however strange not to have sparkling and still water available. I was also given incorrect information at check in. I was told breakfast was till 11am which is correct for weekends but not weekdays. 
Overall brilliant stay and great location and views. ",4,2017,11,06
206,5 stars in every aspect!,"From the moment we arrived to the hotel, every staff member from the doorman to the receptionist to the cleaners were so courteous and pleasant. It is clear that the staff have been trained so well to provide such a professional service. We visited here for the Eventbrite Jo Malone event which was equally as fantastic and well organised. The rooms are gorgeous, the hotel is spotless and the food was like nothing we've ever experienced before. This hotel really is remarkable and its location couldn't be any better no matter what you are doing in Dublin. Already waiting for the second visit.",5,2017,11,06
206,Wow.. Top Notch,"This was by far one of the top 5 best hotels IÔ∏è have ever been to... In the world...

Every aspect of my time there was wonderful. The staff, the building, the bar, the restaurant. IÔ∏è will stay here again for sure in the future.

IÔ∏è haven‚Äôt stayed at many hotels this nice in The States.. Just saying..",5,2017,11,06
206,"Nice hotel - stayed in better, stayed in worse! ","Staff - lovely attentive very friendly.  Reception and concierge very friendly.  A little over bearing at breakfast, my husband and I were having a conversation and the waitress came dashing over asking if I wanted Americano coffee as she thought she had heard me say that.  Nice intention - but then felt like we couldn‚Äôt really talk.

Room - lovely clean spacious room.  We were given a free upgrade which was a nice touch.  There was a lovely little cake left in our room, for my husbands birthday, which was very thoughtful and unexpected.  Bathroom was lovely, great bath!  Nespresso machine in room.  Turn down service was lovely touch too. Good hairdryer and proper iron in room. 
 
Spa - we didn‚Äôt visit. 

Rooftop bar - we didn‚Äôt visit. 

Breakfast - below par for the class of hotel.  Standard let‚Äôs the hotel down, given that it is ‚Ç¨26.  Very disappointed in the quality of the breakfast.  

Location - not as central as some hotels but we didn‚Äôt mind the walk into town. Less than ‚Ç¨10 for a cab.  

Overall a lovely enjoyable stay at the Marker.  Room for improvement (breakfast).  There are some better hotels (in my opinion) in Dublin for the same price range. ",4,2017,11,05
206,Excellent,"An excellent Hotel with a great design. 
The location is well chosen and gives nice views by day and night. 
The hotel staff is forthcoming and efficient.
Breakfast and bar are well stuffed with almost local products.",5,2017,11,05
206,Outstanding hotel,"The amenities, the service, and the food are all outstanding. The room was spacious and‚Äîvery important to me‚Äîquiet. The bathroom was extremely well-equipped (right down to the heated tile floor).  The Marker is within walking distance of the Convention Center but, just as important, it's a quick cab ride (or a 20-minute walk) to the center of Dublin. Outstanding hotel.",5,2017,11,05
206,Fantastic stay,Brilliant hotel to stay in amazing staff a round had a very relaxing stay and would highly recommend this beautiful hotel to anyone. It's in a good location and not far from the city centre also staff are very helpful ,5,2017,11,05
206,A top hotel,"Just excellent  - and the perfect location in the most modern and intense part of the city makes it a good choice for us next time we will go to Dublin. The Marker hotel gives you really high value for money
      ",5,2017,11,05
206,Fabulous stay,"We stayed at this superb hotel for a theatre visit.  We were Upgraded to a deluxe room for booking directly with the hotel.  The hotel is spotless and the room amazing in every way we ate at the bar which was excellent, had cocktails at the rooftop lounge .. amazing.  Fantastic spa area and outstanding breakfast.  Levels of service from every member of staff was superior.  Enjoyed the stay so much we booked for a family trip in the summer before leaving the hotel. Expensive but definitely money well spent.

",5,2017,11,04
206,Great Experience in New Dublin - Hippest District!,"We enjoyed our stay very much. Would come back again if going to Dublin. Great Location and not too far to all sights. Good connection to rail and buses. Breakfast very good, but too expensive. Rooms very large and comfortable. ",5,2017,11,04
206,Excellent hotel,"This hotel is absolutely excellent! The staff, facilities, location, food! It quite literally ticks every single box! Especially if you are looking for somewhere to relax in the hustle and bustle of Dublin City. Ideal location for two theatre buffs like myself and my partner",5,2017,11,04
206,Some aspects of staying here need looking at,"I stayed here for one night while attending a concert ,we paid over two hundred euro for one night with no breakfast,The hotel is spotless the rooms were lovely the staff were really good .We went to the bar at 6 to have some food but it was packed and there were no seats ,just as we got there for a table became available and we sat down ,A manager approached us and said I‚Äôm sorry you can‚Äôt sit there ,I asked why and he pointed to the door and said there are people waiting ,to come in for a seat,I said I‚Äôm a resident here and he said you will have to wait,I left the hotel to go to another bar,When we returned the man came up and said he was sorry for what happened ,and look it wasn‚Äôt his fault the place was busy ,but if I had been told when booking that the roof top bar was closed the dining room was closed and I would have to wait in line for food I would not have booked it,We did tell the reception staff the next morning and a manager came to us to apologize,they didn‚Äôt charge us for the mini bar,they were very apologetic,But I thought it was terrible to be honest and I don‚Äôt know if I would use it again,",4,2017,11,03
206,"Wonderful stay, ideal for business and leisure","Stay was quite short, but still had time for some drinks at the bar as well as for a regenerating swim at the pool early in the morning (perfect the fact that opens really early). Would recommend both for business trips as well as for leisure (short distance from main city sightseeing treasures).",5,2017,11,02
206,My stay at The Marker Hotel,"From the staff to the rooms, everything was exceptional.  Breakfast buffet was great - so much to choose from.  Kamela always took care of us with a smile.  Rooms were clean and spacious.  Front desk was always willing to help.",5,2017,11,02
206,Overnight stay for gig,"We stayed at The Marker as we were attending a gig at the 3 Arena. The hotel is great, service is excellent all the staff were very professional and helpful. The room was really nice. We ate in the Brassiere and went back for cocktails after the gig which were both of a high standard. The only draw back is the price, it is a very expensive treat ",5,2017,11,02
206,It's not 5 star for nothing,"Huuuuge bathroom and bedroom. We had a corner room with a great view. Staff were all very friendly and helped us with everything. The Rooftop bar and Jacuzzi pool were the main reason I booked this and they did not disappoint. Drinks were reasonably priced and it's definitely the best hotel I have ever been to. Great location, I wish I could go back!!!",5,2017,11,01
206,Disappointing,"Hotel is lovely - in a great setting and has an urban luxury vibe.  However, first night, we were advised to eat in the bar and it was absolutely dreadful. Food well below average and vastly overpriced - meals were cold and tasteless. Service was amongst the worst I've ever seen - we were told to eat after 7.30pm as the pre-theatre crowd would have gone - this was the case but there were around 6 waiters walking round seemingly ignoring us.  When we did get to plae our order, items were forgotten, meals arrived one after the other with 5 minute waits between, drinks orders were not delivered. We spent around 300 euros (1 child, 3 adults) and would have been better and more cheaply served by going to a nearby bar!
Next evening, we ordered room service and food was significantly better.
However, we left the dishes in the room assuming the room would be cleaned next day. Spent the next day in the city and returned around 6pm to find our room stinking of food, bed unmade etc etc - room hadn't been cleaned at all. Rang the concierge and then had to go wait around buying expensive drinks whilst we waited for our room to be fit for use - no complimentary drinks offered and no explanation BUT when I mentioned it at checkout, we were subsequently emailed with an apology and offer of a discount on a future stay. This could be a great hotel but think we'll go back to The Merrion for future visits",2,2017,11,01
206,Laughter & Luxury!,"My Wife & I stayed at The Marker whilst seeing Micky Flanagan in late October. The Hotel is pure luxury! The rooms are really spacious and the room service is 2nd to none. The staff all have the 'nothing's ever a problem' attitude which made for a really relaxing, stress free weekend. On our last day, we spent the afternoon in the marvellous Spa at The Marker. After a steam, some more relaxation in the Jacuzzi and a quick bite to eat, we made our way to the airport. It's arguably the best hotel we've stayed in and can't wait to go back! A little pricey but well worth it..",5,2017,11,01
206,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent stay in the heart of Dublin.  New and chic with excellent amenities and friendly staff.  Walking distance to most attractions.  The pool, steam room and spa were the perfect touch after a long flight.  ",5,2017,11,01
206,Beautiful hotel,"
Beautiful modern hotel great location about 2min taxi journey into city centre the staff are extremely helpful and friendly would love to return and spend time in the spa and experience the roof top bar ",5,2017,11,01
206,Relaxing stay,"Stayed one night, really lovely relaxing break, and perfect for seeing Miss Saigon in the Bord Gais theatre. Rooftop bar is a wonderful end to an evening. We ate in the Marker Bar, which for bar food was excellent. Breakfast was super too, spent an hour with the morning papers.",5,2017,10,31
206,Expensive but worth it.,Every encounter with staff was welcoming and courteous. Total relaxation in fabulous surroundings from the moment we arrived. We thoroughly enjoyed every moment of ‚ÄòThe marker experience‚Äô and left feeling like we‚Äôd been on holiday rather than just a night away.  Expensive but worth it for a special occasion. ,5,2017,10,31
206,Wonderful!,"Excellent in ever way..great location in the heart of Dublin,staff couldn't do enough for you,room was spot on,clean and quite,the pool so delightful and peaceful,breakfast amazing....can't wait to return!!",5,2017,10,31
206,Fab hotel.,"Fabulous hotel. Perfect for a night out in town or for a gig a the three arena. 
Reception, bar, room all exceptional. 
May be geared a little more towards business than leisure, nonetheless, brilliant. ",5,2017,10,30
206,weekend with concert break,Just returned from our stay Sat 28 & Sun 29th. First time to stay at this hotel with purpose of going to Hall n Oates concert in 3 Arena last night. Met on arrival in our taxi & assisted with our bags to our room by true gentleman called Alex. Such a warm welcome at reception too with full information about hotel facilities etc. Our room was spacious; clean & well presented in every way. We overlooked the Canal with Bord G√°s Theatre across the street. Breakfast at the hotel was wonderful-an abundance of choice with constant service from the staff. This morning we were warmly greeted by Shane on arrival & attentively served by Karmela (a lovely lady); likewise by the previous morning‚Äôs young lady. Manners of staff & helpfulness impeccable! Then we also met Robert who willingly assisted me in booking return bus tickets home (we had a disappointing start to our journey via Translink for our trip to Dublin without pre-booked tickets). Robert also booked our taxi to Busaras this morning. We will return again ‚ù§Ô∏è,5,2017,10,30
206,Not very welcoming,"I had high hopes when I booked this hotel but I have to say - I didn't experience much Irish charm. I was asked more often than any hotel I've ever stayed in (and I stay in a lot in my job as a media executive) if I was a guest, probably because we were younger and more casual than the rest of the clientele. 
It has great facilities and we were prepared to use them but the hotel didn't seem to want to make them available to guests. we tried to walk into the brasserie at 5 for pre-theatre menu but it was full - no problem but the guy who we spoke too was extremely snotty which was uncalled for! We were asked if we were guests, not that this made a difference to us getting a booking. We headed to the roof terrace but were told it was full - we were then asked if we were guests (again) and we were told to have a drink at the bar - as soon as we bought cocktails mysteriously a table upstairs was available - when we went upstairs there were loads of free tables. We then tried again for the brasserie for another night and were asked again if we were guests - this time following booking the guy followed us into the lifts until we reached our floor. The only exception to all this was the spa who treated us kindly and had fantastic treatments though I have to say they yet again asked us if we were staying in the hotel - despite me pre-booking a 145 pound treatment. All-in-all - ok hotel - but should make facilities more available to guests and please, stop asking guests if they are staying - it's your job to know!",2,2017,10,30
206,The Marker Dublin,"I stayed at the Marker in Dublin while attending a conference. The property was amazing. From the time I arrived the service was 5 star. I used the gym during my stay, but unfortunately did not get to the sauna or pool. Don't make the same mistake.",5,2017,10,30
206,Affordable Luxury,"We spent a weekend at The Marker Hotel and we really enjoyed it! The Hotel is a real 5 stars, but is not as expensive as you may imagine. The Hotel is pretty new with extremely refined interiors. Rooms are very comfortable with breathtaking view from the all height windows. SPA is really cool with a stylish swimming pool (water a little cold). Breakfast has a lot of fresh products. Brasserie is not overpriced. So all in all an affordable luxury only slightly more expensive than a 4 stars.",5,2017,10,30
206,"Excellent hotel, great vibe","Location down in the revitalised waterfront area, modern, great vibe and bar area. Staff were excellent, knowledgeable and welcoming. Room was fine, not much natural light, not much of a view but given was there for meetings this did not matter but would have bothered me more if on a personal trip. Nice touches throughout the hotel, attention to detail with bottle of water in room, very popular bar and meeting place. Got excellent room rate by searching online. Top tip would be to pay slightly extra and take waterfront tunnel route to airport from this hotel and avoid delays in Dublin city centre. ",4,2017,10,30
206,"Stay here, you won't regret it.","I stayed a week for business and have stayed in many hotels across the world. This one is exceptional. Fantastic staff, great food and location, spacious, luxurious rooms and one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. The french toast and berries was an excellent breakfast choice! ",5,2017,10,29
206,"Great hotel, location and staff","Great hotel with convenient, but quiet location.  The staff was very friendly and helpful and the room itself was luxurious, very clean and large.  Enjoyed the location - not too far from the center of town, but quiet.",5,2017,10,29
206,Terrific hotel and staff,"This was my first (and hopefully first of many!) trips to Ireland. Such a great welcome, unfailingly friendly staff, and genuinely helpful. The staff are knowledgeable of everything around the area, to help you find just the right restaurant to how to finding what you want just within walking distance.",5,2017,10,29
206,Nice modern hotel,"Nice modern hotel. Spacious and clean room. Nice staff and good services. A little bit of distance from city centre which is the only shortfall. Beyond that, excellent experience and will definitely consider for next trip as well",4,2017,10,29
206,Nice and shiny,"I can't really fault the Marker. It's nice and feels new and the staff couldn't be more helpful. I was initially shown a twin room and they moved me to a double with minimal hassle. The room service was good - in particular the Marker burger. 

It was a pleasant stay but I would just say that if you have an opportunity to stay at the Merrion; do. It has a certain intangible special experience which you don't get at the Marker. ",4,2017,10,28

206,Best hotel in Dublin!!,"Absolutely gorgeous hotel and great staff, very helpful and such a nice stay, not too far from city centre or  Stephan's green and  would be a nice walk on a nice day. Rooms were exceptional above all else, very clean, quiet, very modern, comfortable, and have all you would need. Concierge and valet parking was very efficient, friendly and helpful. Front desk were great. The breakfast was very good with a lot on offer. The rooftop bar was beautiful and drinks were very good value for money. Overall a great stay and would definitely stay again. Highly recommend it, especially if you were attending the Bord Gais Theatre for a show, as we were, as it across from the entrance. 10 out of 10 stars and they earned every one.",5,2017,10,24
206,Excellent,Stylish and comfortable; very well organized and efficient in a warm and friendly environment. Suitable for business and pleasure stays. The bed is super and the breakfast perfect. The hotel is located in a modern part of town next door to a theatre and quite a few restaurants. It is easy to walk into town or very close to bus-stops and train stations.,5,2017,10,24
206,Weekend break,"Fantastic location and great service, home away from home.  We attended a show in the Bord Gais which is outside the front door and ate in one of the nearby restaurants....and our walk in to town only took about 10 mins....we will be back ",5,2017,10,24
206,First Class,"This hotel is perhaps the epitome of the word first class.  The second we arrived by cab in the rain, we were met with umbrellas!  The lobby area is spectacular and it appears even locals find it the place to be, especially on a Friday night.  The rooms have spectacular views and are absolutely beautiful and comfortable.  Highly recommend it if you want a first class stay in Dublin.",5,2017,10,23
206,Weekend in Dublin,"Very welcoming hotel and staff. Bar area very lively in a good way. Breakfast was lovely too. 15 min walk to city centre a little far in the rain! Easy access to the airport. All staff couldn‚Äôt do enough to help, faultless",5,2017,10,23
206,We Want To Stay Longer!,"From the time we arrived we received kind and caring service of an excellent level. 

We were given a corner suite which is probably bigger than some apartments. Beautiful fittings, huge bathroom and everything in excellent order and a like new condition. The bed was very comfortable and pillows great not the usual soft almost no pillow you get used to at lessor Hotels. 

Excellent amenities and coffee maker.

Wifi is free and with a very strong connection. Very important in this day and age. A large desk which enables plenty of room for a laptop.

Had one of the best breakfast meals we have had in the world from real Italian tomato juice and beautifully hot buffet to toast if ordered delivered to your table. 

No standing in front of a toaster  that never seems to toast or a conveyer toaster which requires three or four trips through like most Hotels. 

As for the dinner menu. It was also excellent with a range of outstanding dishes.

The Marker is also located centrally with any amount of quality eating establishments close by.

It is the small things that make the difference and make standout and The Marker has done that in our eyes.

Where will we stay if ever back in a Dublin the Marker without doubt.",5,2017,10,20
206,Ams,"Excellent staff, great hotel. Nothing is to much trouble for the staff at this lovely Dublin hotel.  Warm and friendly, without being intrusive. Amenities in the hotel are also excellent, and the spa treatments very worthwhile.",5,2017,10,20

206,Excellence,"Wonderful weekend break. well worth the extra spend and will definitely be back and recommend to others. The staff were super helpful and very obliging. The room was spacious, excellent view over the docks.",5,2017,10,18
206,"Great, modern style hotel with price add-on breakfast and fantastic pool with too early closing hours","The rooms and overall architecture are beautiful and modern styled, everyone was very polite and comforting. Complimentary coffee on the rooms included. Add-on breakfast prices are quite high at ~25‚Ç¨ per person. (Just go out and get some snacks in the nearby supermarket or explore cafes around the city, for 50‚Ç¨ you can get a lot a la carte as a couple instead.)
The pool area features a beautiful infinite 36m pool which is perfect for swimming, a relaxing jacuzzi, sauna and steam chamber are also there. Unfortunately this area closes much too early at around 8pm ‚Äì esp. for a 5 star hotel it would be great to be able to end the day there after an exhausting shopping day or sightseeing tour in the spa area until at least midnight, esp. when there is not  so much else to do in Dublin on a Sunday night.",5,2017,10,18

206,Great Services and amazing food,I've stayed at the Marker Hotel only for 3 days and it was a great experience. The food is amazing and the service is even better. The staff pays a lot of attention on your needs and it gives you the feeling that they read your mind which is great!,5,2017,10,16
206,Marker,"We stayed in the Marker on the last night of our honey moon. The staff were very friendly and helpful, they put lovely half bottle of red wine in our room with some chocolates to help us celebrate our wedding which was a nice touch. We unfortunately discovered on arrival that the rooftop bar is only open at the weekend during the colder months. Over all a very nice stay but not good value for money.",4,2017,10,15
206,Largely positive but not Four rather than Five star,"Stayed here on business.
Hotel is located in the docks area close to the convention centre.
Staff are ok but more four star than five star level. More Crowne Plaza than Four Seasons.
The whole feel of the hotel is also more four star than five star.

I was asked if I wanted my bags taken to my room and if would like to be shown my room. A five star would just do both these things. 
Similarly you had to phone for an evening turn down service instead of it just being done.

The room lighting and whole hotel lighting is extremely dim/trendy. I often needed to use my phone as a torch in my room even with all the lights on. I am not old.

No plugs to charge iPad or phone by the bed is irritating these days particularly when many hotels are even moving away from plugs to USB points. To not have either is not good for a hotel of this standard.

Strange lack of storage in the room with no bedside drawers or indeed hardly any drawers at all and one small wardrobe.

Bathroom products an unknown make. No L‚Äôocitane, Moulton Brown or Hermes here regrettably.

The room service staffs grasp of English was so poor (on multiple occasions) that I had to repeat orders several times.

Only one Spa/pool receptionist was on duty who was engaged in a long phone call when I entered the Spa. Aside from being proffered the book to sign in, I was otherwise not verbally acknowledge or given a towel or slippers despite waiting for over a minute.
I had to go back to the spa reception to get them when I realised they weren‚Äôt available around the pool / changing area. The receptionist appeared unbothered I was having to do this. 

Cocktails in the hotel lobby bar were good as was breakfast.

The signature roof top bar is only open on Friday and Saturday evenings in Oct-Dec so I was unable to try this which was a shame considering the evenings were warm and the hotel was completely full.
I believe there are plans to enclose this area so perhaps it will be useable for more if the year in future.

Overall definitely a Four not five star experience. So disappointing if you were expecting the latter not the former.

This is not a bad hotel but the staffing levels and training are not sufficient for it to be a five star.

Adjust your expectations accordingly.",4,2017,10,14
206,Luxurious weekend,"We had a great stay at the Marker. We had a fantastic room, the staff was so friendly and knowledgeable and the spa was breathtaking. The breakfast was unbelievably fresh. I would recommend the Marker to everyone! ",5,2017,10,14
206,Visited for Spanish Wine Fayre,"Very attentive staff. Function room was well laid out. Staff at front door to direct you to correct location.
Gents wash room spotless. Very impressed with the set up.We visited as a small group
to taste Spanish Wines and as this event was held in a different hotel last year we were keen to do a comparison and were not disappointed. Would consider staying over on our next visit to Dublin. Well done to the staff.",5,2017,10,13
206,John Bishop,Lovely hotel. Bedrooms were so quiet which was brilliant. Must say it was the best nights sleep I ever had in a hotelüòä Location a bit far from city centre but very convenient for 3 arena &John Bishop concert. Inconvenient that there is no car park.  Staff did park our car for us e24 per night üò•. Met John Bishop in the hotel which was an added bonus!,4,2017,10,12
206,Perfect End to 10-Day European Vacation,Perfect stay while in Dublin. The hotel is conveniently located to public transportation to and from the Dublin airport.  15-20 minute walk and short taxi ride to Temple Bar. We got breakfast included and the buffet bar was above average for hotel buffet breakfast. ,5,2017,10,12
206,Girlie night away,"Stayed with my friend for a night away from the children and this place was pure luxury. Check in was great, room was perfect, rooftop bar was fantastic and breakfast next morning couldn‚Äôt have been better. I just wished I could have stayed longer to indulge in a longer breakfast. Expensive but well worth the money if you‚Äôre looking for a great hotel, in a great new location. ",5,2017,10,12
206,Great hotel - everything was effortless ,"From the moment we pulled up everything was easy.  The bellman came right to the door to get our stuff.  The woman at the front desk made check in easy.  There was another gentleman working at the front desk, noticed I had a bottle of champagne.  He offered to have it put on ice and sent up to our room.  We were leaving too early the next morning for the start of breakfast so they offered it to go.  The room was very spacious and clean.  The bathroom had heated floors.  The hotel is walking distance to quite a few restaurants and even a grocery store.  Great location if you want to be away from the city center.  It is only a $7-8‚Ç¨ cab ride to Grafton St.  I would stay here again.",5,2017,10,12
206,Charming hotel for business travelers,"The Marker is a lovely hotel in Dublin, perfect for the business traveler.  The rooms are very efficiently designed, making good use of the space.  The rooms are are clean, the bathrooms are pristine, and the beds are very comfortable.  Each room is equipped with its own wi-fi.  The staff is also very friendly and helpful.",5,2017,10,11

206,WOW,"I booked the hotel for my wife‚Äôs birthday weekend away treat, it was everything and more in our expectations. The attention to detail was above and beyond in each interaction we had with staff. There was always an electric buzz in the hotel bar and the rooftop bar was a lovely experience. The food in the restaurant was out of this world, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and highly recommend the hotel. ",5,2017,10,10
206,Great room,"I stayed in this hotel twice in the last month on business for the first time. It's a great hotel. Very friendly and fast check in. Very professional and friendly staff. Nice little touches. Walked to the elevator etc. My room on both stays faced the water. The room had all you could want. Great shower, great bed and plenty of room. Had dinner one night and it was great. Breakfast too was super. 
I stayed here on business and came to the conclusion that it wouldn't be a hotel for my three children. It's nice and busy and I just figured that it's prefect for the business traveler. ",5,2017,10,10
206,Dublin Vacation,"We booked The Marker on recommendation from a previous visit by our children and other family members on a previous visit. The experience was worth it. The room was clean, presentable and comfortable.  Excellent central location with very good views of the surrounding canal and downtown.",5,2017,10,10
206,first time in Dublin,The rooftop bar was terrific.  Loved the blankets and neck warmers.  We had a waitress from the Holland who was very kind and friendly as was the gentleman who was there.  I wish it hadn't been smoking but the breeze took care of most of the smoke.,5,2017,10,10
206,"Excellent, Worth Every Penny!","My husband and I stayed at The Marker on our recent trip to Dublin.  There are so many wonderful things to compliment, that I am not quite sure where to start! First, the staff was spectacular; they were welcoming, helpful and full of fantastic information to make our stay more enjoyable.  The rooms were large, clean and well appointed.  The spa was amazing after a transatlantic flight, arriving much earlier then check in time, the staff kindly gave us complimentary access to the sauna, hot tub, lap pool and steam room!

In addition to our generally wonderful stay, we ended up missing our flight back to the states (whole different issue) and had to stay another night in Dublin.  We called The Marker from the airport about extending our stay and they could not have been more gracious.  They took an extremely upsetting situation and turned it into an opportunity to enjoy Dublin for one more night.  We would not stay anywhere else while in Dublin and recommend The Marker wholeheartedly.",5,2017,10,10
206,Amazing stay!,"Can‚Äôt fault the hotel at all, all staff so friendly and helpful and made us feel welcome! Had an amazing stay from start to finish and the rooftop bar just topped it for us what a view! Would love to come back!",5,2017,10,10
206,Excellent hotel close to 3Arena,"Booked in here for some luxury for our over-night to see a show in the 3Arena. The hotel was super comfortable, but the outstanding memory would be the staff - they couldn't do enough for us. Water bottles in the car when the valet parking attendant dropped it back was a nice touch and representative of the ""little extras"" that we found here. I will 100% be coming back to the Marker.",5,2017,10,10
206,Marker Hotel,"Outstanding hotel, great location, extremely courteous and professional staff. This is the second time that I have stayed there in the past year, and they matched the last time. The rooms are spacious, which is a-typical of many hotel rooms that I have experienced in Europe. ",5,2017,10,08
206,Lovely 5 * hotel,"We liked the The Marker very much! It lived up to the 5* hotel standards big time. The hotel is beautifully designed, high investment in the design and decor that makes you feel relaxed immediately. The rooms are large and beautiful, the bath is huge and lovely with floor heating.
We also liked the breakfast although it seemed that the vegetables are some kind of national treasure- so few and we‚Äôll hidden üòÅ
Great service everywhere, we loved Yulia at front dear, she has been great help and very kind .
Last, SPA - you must visit!!! Amazingly beautiful pool , nice sauna and the design is again well thought and most relaxing.",5,2017,10,08
206,"Excellent hotel - great staff, very welcoming.",A wonderful experience.  The staff were exceptional.   The service was great.  The location down by the water yet a short walk to city centre and to the stadium is terrific.  The good was excellent - lots of healthy options.  We had a reception on the rooftop which has lovely views and a very cool ambiance.,5,2017,10,08
206,Delightful stay in Dublin,"The hotel is quiet and strategically located near the river and close to the conference center. The staff are helpful and friendly. The service is impeccable. The breakfast, with its fresh and healthy choices, was a great way to start the day. The best hotel in Dublin if you swim and exercise on your business trips.",5,2017,10,07
206,The Marvelous Marker!,"We stayed at The Marker in August 2017 for two nights to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary.  It was a last minute booking and from beginning to end we were so well looked after.  We visit Dublin often and like to try the many different hotels in the city however the Marker really has left its mark on us!  The setting is lovely and yes it may seem a little away from the city centre but is a very pleasant 15 - 20 minutes walk.  There is also a lot to explore around the area and we also walked in a different direction along the canal to the Aviva Stadium (just for a walk not to attend an event).  There are coffee shops and restaurants close by to the hotel and of course the Bord Gais Theatre, also close to the 3Arena .  The exterior of the building is modern and quite stunning.  

We arrived on a Sunday afternoon and had booked Le Drunch in the main restaurant on arrival (as is closed on Sunday evenings).  Le Drunch is highly recommended and great value especially for this category of hotel - there were a few Dublin folks spending a relaxed afternoon in the restaurant.  Food was lovely.  Afterwards we had a cocktail in the rooftop bar - it is amazing after all these years visiting Dublin to see the city from a totally different perspective, fabulous views and lovely bar.  

We were upgraded to a corner suite which was fantastic and spotlessly clean with the most amazing black marble bathroom (loved the Malin+Goetz toiletries).  There was a lovely welcome gift of choccie cookies and special message card. The room has all the amenities you need including a proper hairdryer with plenty of plugs and IT sockets.  Breakfast was fabulous a great choice including a proper honeycomb, we had the full Irish breakfast which was so tasty.  We also had drinks in the main bar which was relaxed, yes expensive but is a 5 star hotel.  

The atmosphere in the whole hotel is relaxed, friendly and not at all pretentious.  We had a fabulous memorable anniversary.  I normally do not name a particular member of staff, everyone was lovely however Laura Garcia was our contact before arriving and the arrangements she made were all first class - thank you!.  We highly recommend The Marker for business or leisure and hope to return some day soon.",5,2017,10,07
206,The Marker Hotel Dublin,"The hotel is in the business district of Dublin, the staff are very polite and courteous.  Food is pretty good although I only eat off the brasserie menu, the fruit berry platter is great!  The hotel is a bit pricey as I stay in similar hotels in Frankfurt such as the Sofitel & Hilton and both have pools.  Overall the hotel is very clean, I enjoy staying there and it is my preferred hotel in Dublin.

 ",4,2017,10,06
206,Dublin at its best,First class services and accommodation catering to both the business and casual traveler. Located in a preferred and quiet setting surrounded by dining and bar options within accessible proximity to the city centre,5,2017,10,05
206,Perfection,"From check out to check out it was a true five star expierence!!!!!!! Every staff member we came across were friendly, positive, knowledgeable and every request was dealt with in a can do hassle free manor.",5,2017,10,04
206,Undecided üòû,"I stayed here with my friend and it was really nice. The staff were nice, the rooms were clean and spacious & the bathroom was really large.
There is also a spa in the Marker which is very clean and not too crowded (or at least when I was there) .
The bonus of staying here however was the rooftop bar as all night long it just had that 'Wow' value! Though I believe over the winter months it maybe closed - not totally sure. 

The hotel was 'nice' the only thing I'd say is I wouldn't consider it a boutique hotel or a 5 star üòî beside the rooftop it was slightly ordinary, nice but ordinary and the price your paying you would really expect a little something else on offer to make it just that slightly bit more exciting & unfortunately in my opinion The Marker didn't have it.",4,2017,10,04
206,Dublin Getaway,"Our trip and stay were wonderful! Great location and high quality service! The sunset from the Rooftop is so beautiful. The spa, pool and steam room are a great place to relax. The Brassiere is good and very accommodating. And there are good restaurants nearby, plus a Fresh market.",5,2017,10,04
206,Wonderful Stay,"Wonderful stay at the Marker, located in the tech hub of the city it's a quick walk to the heart of Dublin. The modern hotel had amazing beds and amentities including the break taking rooftop bar which looks over the whole city.",5,2017,10,04
206,Special 30th Birthday Treat,"We enjoyed a really fantastic overnight here in September and cannot fault this hotel at all.  The room was large and clean with a beautiful view!  All staff provided a really fantastic service and were very courteous and friendly.  The breakfast was absolutely to die for and probably one of the best spreads we have experienced in city hotels, absolutely delicious!  We didn't get the chance to enjoy the rooftop bar on our stay but enjoyed a cocktail & Guinness in the lobby bar which were very tasty and the staff again, were lovely.  It was my 30th birthday so it was lovely to receive a personalised card and birthday cheesecake in the room.  We loved everything about this hotel and it's location to the sights of Dublin City!

206,Exceptional Service,My husband and I visited Dublin for the first time in 13 years and the Marker was recommended to me by colleagues who used it for business trips to the city. It did not disappoint!! Apart from being ideally located and incredibly luxurious the service is outstanding and a reason in itself to return. ,5,2017,10,03
206,Excellent stay in Dublin,"Probably the best hotel in Dublin: excellent location, good stay and above all a very good sleep! Beds are so soft and comfortable and you can really relax yourself.
Breakfast is excellent and each service is like a 5-stars hotel has to be.",5,2017,10,03
206,Great roof terrace for cocktails,Beautiful afternoon in Dublin when we visited so decided to go to the Marker Hotels fab roof garden.  Enjoyed a wide variety of well made cocktails great fun atmosphere and chilled sounds worth a visit on a sunny day,5,2017,10,03
206,disappointed,"door and reception staff were very attentive, helpful and pleasant.  The roof top restaurant was the only attraction for us to stay to eat at the hotel, food was nice but the service is very lacking.  Should be much better for the cost.",3,2017,10,03
206,Long threatening comes at last,The brassiere excellent food good value and a waiter who actually believed the customer was important hope he made it back to Finglas on his bike. Disappointed the roof top bar wasn't open but definitely  go back for an appetitive in the rooftop and another meal in the brassiere,5,2017,10,02
206,First class from arrival to departure,"Wonderful stay at the Marker Hotel, pure luxury and excellent service from all the attentive staff made this a wonderful overnight stay. Looking forward to returning. Highly recommend a stay here and especially a visit to the rooftop bar.",5,2017,10,02
206,Superb venue for a celebration,Great place for a celebration . We had a big family event last weekend. Topped off with drinks on the rooftop terrace. The surrounding area is spectacular with lights shining on the grand canal and many good restaurants to choose from,5,2017,10,02
206,European Charm,"The Marker hotel is lovely. The staff  is exceptional, courteous and they take customer service to the next level. I've visited Dublin more than a dozen times for business and I keep coming back to The Marker not because of the location (which is great) or the hotel room (which is great also) - it's because the staff. The restaurant isn't my favorite but you will enjoy it if are a fan of up-scale dining. That doesn't deter me from returning either as there are several restaurant options available in the immediate area, as well as room service. The rooftop bar is also fun and exciting with a 360 view of the dock area. I am already booked to return for business in the coming months and my room is already reserved - look forward to see my extended family every time I get an opportunity to return.
",4,2017,10,02
206,Pleasant stay,"Highly recommend this hotel. It was an enjoyable stay and loved the facilities and the wonderful spa. Didn't like that they increased the prices for the week, because they knew there are some big conferences going on at the same time. ",5,2017,10,02
206,Great Hotel,"Great hotel, efficient welcoming staff, lovely atmosphere, very relaxing, great views from canal side rooms, breakfast great, large spacious rooms, great side bathrooms, have recommended many times, never disappoints.",5,2017,10,02
206,Short trip to Dublin,"Very comfortable stay albeit only for the one night. Hotel is well positioned for the Dock area where I was working. The Hotel is modern, well appointed with pleasant staff. I would recommend it and stay there next time I am in Dublin",4,2017,10,02
206,A+  Amazing!,"I have stayed twice at the Marker. I will stay again. The hotel is upscale and luxury average. It is a 5 star for sure....But the service made me and my family feel like rockstars on two different stays. The service was the best I've had ever. The made us feel spectacular. I can not sing their praises loudly enough. You will not be disappointed in the accommodation, it is solidly a nice hotel, but you will come back for the service. Well done to The Marker for making your guests feel important and very special!",5,2017,10,01
206,Modern Hotel with lovely staff,"Nice location, great ambience and lovely staff.  The location is not very central but the area is very hip and fun. The hotel is new and modern and makes it very desirable for business as well as pleasure.",4,2017,10,01
206,Fabulous,"Did not stay here, had kids performing at Bord Gais so we had a lot of time to pass at this hotel before show. Such lovely staff so friendly and welcoming I was a bit hesitant whilst walking but they made us so welcome. Food was delicious. Kids arrived later absolutely no problem to get them what they wanted to eat. And staff made them feel so welcome too. Well done and keep up the good work we are already planning a night here as the ambience, food and relaxing atmosphere makes us want to return ASAP ",5,2017,10,01
206,First stay at Marker Hotel. Will definitely not be my last.,"I travel frequently for business and have stayed in hundreds of hotels, the Marker is up there as one of the best. It was recommended to me by colleagues so I was expecting it to be acceptable, was not expecting it to be as good as it is. I would happily stay here every business trip if I could. From first impressions, through check-in, the quality of my room, the professionalism of all the staff I can into contact with to the room service menu, cannot think of one thing that wasn't perfect.",5,2017,09,30
206,"Luxurious rooms, Great Service","I've stayed here for work a few times and just had another wonderful stay. The room service was great, wonderful food options--and arrived so quickly! 

The rooms are well appointed & spacious. The bathroom is huge and the tub is practically a swimming pool. The location is very close to my office so this is my preferred location for work travel.",5,2017,09,29
206,"Quick Trip, Great Stay","My husband and I only had one night to spend at the Marker, but the hotel still exceeded all of our reservations.  The Concierge secured a last-minute reservation at a perfect restaurant after a quick discussion of our preferences.  The room was spacious and comfortable and modern, with a great view of a nearby plaza and waterway.  My only regret is that we didn't have more time to check out the restaurants and bar (particularly the rooftop!)",5,2017,09,28
206,Excellent address,"Stayed a few nights at the Marker last week - Excellent stay! From the minute I got out of the cab the staff was above excellent. Great architecture and quality finishes in a great location to the city!  Excellent rooms and hotel amenities/features etc... Only have a couple MINOR points to pass on to management - bathroom..there were some replaced tiles.. shoddy install and mismatched grout wasn't in keeping especially for the high hotel price point; high end elegant rain style glass shower had a cheap non-rain style showerhead that aimed out the door, felt like a poorly thought out replacement; was a bit disappointed by the charcuterie board ! Felt like it could have been better.. Just wasn't very good in an otherwise perfect place with good food drink staff amenities etc. That said this in no way changes my opinion.. the Marker is  an EXCELLENT choice for a Dublin address and I will return! ",4,2017,09,27
206,top class hotel,"the marker is a beautiful hotel situated with a great location to Dublin City centre shops and tourist attractions, lovely staff great buzz all through the hotel. rooms are spacious and comfortable, five star experience",5,2017,09,27
206,Night at the Marker,"Fabulous night stay at the Marker.  Was attending a show in the Bord Gais Theatre. Perfect location to stay for visit to the Theatre. Lovely room ,staff very friendly and helpful. Lovely food in the Marker Bar. The spa facilities are excellent.  Cannot fault this fabulous hotel.  ",5,2017,09,27
206,Ireland,"Excellent! Loved the hotel. I will recommend it to anyone staying in Dublin.It is close to everything in Dublin, the staff was wonderful and very helpful.  Room was beautiful. The shower could be a little bigger though. ",5,2017,09,25
206,Good Hotel,"The Marker is a very cool, modern hotel, in a great part of town. It is close to the centre, without being in the middle of the tourist traps. It has a fun bar, and a great roof terrace bar with fantastic views. The rooms are big and comfortable.",4,2017,09,25
206,Slick offering,"Very fine hotel - staff operating at a 5* level, great pool / sauna / steam room; rooms nice, clean, good size, good toiletries. Location mightn't be to everyone's taste, but if that's not a problem then crack on. modern, glassy... very different from other 5* in Dublin but perfectly good",5,2017,09,25
206,"Overpriced, Hot and poor breakfast plus no roof top bar!","I find it really hard to write this review as we were invited to Dublin with friends who have been 3 times before. They couldn't praise this hotel enough before arrival especially the roof top bar. We booked months in advance so we were looking forward to it and got a deal with breakfast.

On arrival the rooms were not ready. We came back later and got a room right near the lifts. We had a deluxe room. We had no internet, no working TV and the mini bar was not stocked up from the previous people. Looks like a nice room but it is rather jaded in parts, varnish missing from bathroom door, parts of bed valance falling apart. The engineers came t fix the TV and we then got our code for internet. Half an hour later the missing bits from the mini bar were replaced. The whole group agreed to meet for a drink at the roof top bar. To our horror we were told that for both nights the bar was not available until 6pm. We were not even allowed to go up and see. Really disappointed with this as all week we had a generic message from the front desk saying they couldn't do more for us before we arrived but then never mentioned the roop top bar being leased out. When mentioned to the staff we were told there is a foyer bar. Not the same thing if you ask me. 

The rooms are really hot and uncomfortable and sleeping is a nightmare unless you like AC, which even when it's at it's lowest temp doesn't work properly. The hotel corridors are really dark and stuffy and not very appealing at all.

Now for the morning after. We were so happy to get a deal with this hotel which included breakfast. For such an expensive hotel which came with a side order of staff having an answer for everything, you would have thought the breakfast was going to be good. Oh no, the cold part was ok with your usual cereals and breads and cheese, but the hot breakfast was awful. Luke warm food, been sitting around for ages. The bacon had no taste, as well as the potato dish which was so dry. It was disgusting really and again we felt cheated. It was the food temperature and quality which was the worst I've had. The end it, the coffee was cold when it arrived and the tea is poured out after a few seconds of brewing  so it was like dish water. They need to taste their own food and refine this service. Other hotels get this so right.

Would I stay again, no. Is it overpriced - yes. Do I feel cheated - very much so and I have to say it did spoilt our weekend. We are looking at other hotels for next year.",1,2017,09,25
206,Great Docks hotel,"Excellent service at this high end hotel!  Staff was extremely attentive, food was excellent, accommodations were clean bed was awesome, and decor very modern.  
We held a company reception and service, food and drink were perfect. Waitstaff couldn't be more friendly.  

",5,2017,09,24
206,Great stay,"Highly recommend. Beautiful hotel,  excellent service, location in a modern area, fantastic room. Concierge service was of great contribution to get to know better Dublin and Ireland. Not a walking distance to main city tourism points but easy and not expensive by taxi. ",5,2017,09,24
206,Overpriced and hot,"We stayed at the Marker Hotel on our last night in Ireland at the end of August. We wanted to stay somewhere comfortable to get a good night's sleep and breakfast prior to our early flight back to NYC. Although our room was upgraded and was very modern and nice, we had a few problems that turned out to be pretty major, and therefore can't give the hotel more than 3 stars.

First, the room is hot.  The end of August in Ireland isn't particularly warm - it was rather chilly when we were there - but it was SWELTERING in our room.  There is no way to open the windows and there is no A/C, which made it unreasonably uncomfortable (and we live in NYC with no central air).  When we asked about the temperature, we were pointed to a fan in the corner of the room.  Of course, circulating hot air did nothing for us.  For ~$300/night in a hotel that appears to be newly built, this is inexcusable.  I'll add that we spent our first night in Dublin at the Fitzwilliam, a similarly ranked hotel, where there was air conditioning and climate control.

Second, our sink did not drain.  The Marker was responsive and sent someone up to examine it, but they said they couldn't do anything.  The manager on duty that night said he'd leave a note for the morning manager, but the morning manager said nothing to us about the situation when we checked out, and I wasn't keen on having to remind her or raise it again.  She should have proactively discussed it with us and given us a discount as a matter of good faith.

Third, the morning breakfast was pretty subpar.  It's just not very good.  Once again, the Fitzwilliam's breakfast surpassed the Marker's by quite a bit.

The Marker sent us a survey after our stay, where I explained these issues, and in response offered us a discount on any future stay - not very useful unless we fly back to Dublin again.  Having worked in the service industry myself, I'm not sure why they thought that would be helpful to us.

All-in-all, given the cost of this hotel, I would recommend staying elsewhere.",3,2017,09,24
206,Great hotel.,Not been to any other hotel in Dublin but this one - but definitely compares to the comfort one is after and finds around the world in different hotels. Would definitely go back to The Marker on my next visit.,5,2017,09,24
206,Fantastic place.,"In a very new place across the river a wonterful hotel for our visit in Dublin.
The staff always ready to help you with a nice smile .
Very clean brand new with a nice atmosfaire.
You can swim if you like to relax but also to expore the city.
Absloutly recomented.",5,2017,09,23
206,Can really recommend the Marker!,"Fantastic service, very nice rooms and food was great. Maybe not walking distance to everything but very nice location if you want to sleep in the nights. Beds are really nice as well! Everything just went smooth from checking in ro checking out!",5,2017,09,23
206,"Superb, beautiful, convenient","We just completed a week's stay at The Marker.  Wonderful place--- beautiful, modern, great staff and service, immaculate rooms and very quiet.  The breakfast is amazing, and the bar area is always buzzing.  The service throughout the hotel is excellent.  We had several particular things we needed help with from the staff, and they were all eager to help.  The breakfast staff is particularly great.

The Marker is an easy 20-30 minute walk from all of the major sightseeing areas in central Dublin, but it's also tucked away from the crowds and noise on the new and very modern Grand Canal.  So we felt we got the best of both worlds.  If you're a runner, there are 5k and 10k routes mapped out from the hotel through the area so it's easy to get around.

All in all, we had a fantastic stay.  We'd definitely return.",5,2017,09,22
206,Great days in The Marker Hotel,"Never had such an easy check in and out. Really well trained staff and very helpful. Next time in Dublin we would again choose "" The Marker ""
The Concierge was a great help and always very friendly, even when it came to confirm our flights, which took him more than half an hour. Lufthansa was really difficult. 
Breakfast very good and fresh. Rooftop Bar wonderful. There was nothing missing. 

",5,2017,09,21
206,What a hotel!,We were on tour in Dublin and only got to spend a night at The Marker. Gorgeous hotel. Breakfast was great and breakfast room was lovely. Pool was nice and water was a nice temperature. I can't wait to return. ,5,2017,09,20
206,Weekend Break ,The Marker is an excellent hotel. The staff are fantastic and cant do enough for you. Rooms are stylish and comfortable. The beds are most comfortable ive ever been in. Great location and lovely restaraunts near by but be sure to make reservations early. Overall great experience and i will be back!! ,5,2017,09,20
206,Great Dublin Weekend,"Guest room was great, valet service may the drive in and drive out very easy. The valet even went to the car to retrieve my glasses. The room service breakfast was of very good quality and variety -  and between us we ordered a sample of a few things. Fruit, yogurt, waffles, egg white omelettes. Super corner room with great people and canal watching throughout our stay. ",5,2017,09,20
206,Fantastic in every way,"Great room, great food and bar, incredible staff. Really can't think of a single thing I would change. Would happily recommend and return anytime - we were blown away by the level of service we received.",5,2017,09,20
206,Modern luxury but not cheap,"Modern business hotel.  No cosy hotel but correct for business meetings.  However not cheap.   Eating is also not the main attraction here, since all is quite well but not exciting.    Poolside nicely kept but limited area.",3,2017,09,20
206,Relaxing Stay,"Wonderful stay, excellent staff, beautiful Hotel. 
Don't be like us and lose track of time and miss out on having a drink in the roof top bar which closes at 11 o'clock !    Ah well, will just have to go back again.",5,2017,09,20
206,``Marker Hotel on the Grand Canal,``````We had a wonderful 3 days in Du blin and really enjoyed the location of the Marker.  It was a top-notch hotel. The heated bathroom floors were a bonus.  The maid service was quick to respond.  Everyone working there was committed to making it a delightful stay.,5,2017,09,20
206,Excellent,"Really have nothing to complain about. Breakfast was the best I've had out of all my stays throughout the world and the set up/service was very good throughout. 
In the room itself it's very spacious with free excellent amenities in the shampoo, moisturiser, chocolate cake (always a winner :) ) etc ",5,2017,09,20
206,Great Hotel and fantastic service,"Beautiful hotel, great area and fantastic service. Loved being away from the crazy Temple Bar scene but within walking distance to it and many other Dublin highlights.  From the moment we pulled up until we drove away, everyone was so friendly and professional. Hotel is immaculate. Pool and spa are delightful and soothing. Rooms are spacious, well appointed and bed is comfy. After traveling for 12+ hours we were quite pleased with the hotel location and amneties . Fitness center met my needs. Hop On/Hop Off bus is a block away. Town a short walk. Taxis are easy to grab, especially when Evignly is on duty at the door. He and receptionist Yulie made our trip even better especially after our long flights. We traveled with another couple who were equally pleased. We will definitely stay at The Marker on our next excursion to Dublin.
",5,2017,09,20
206,Great hotel - comfortable and convenient,"Spacious room, super clean, very convenient/walking distance to office. Food in the bar area was tasty and available later in the evening than the main restaurant.  Staff was very nice and helpful.  Great amenities.",5,2017,09,17
206,Superb Hotel ,Just had the pleasure of a one night stay in the hotel. The staff don't simply aim to serve they aim to satisfy and they succeed. Attention to customers and detail really shines through. The rooms are spacious and the under heating in the bathroom floors is a nice touch. Food in the restaurant was delicious. If you are going to splash out and enjoy yourself in Dublin then the Marker Hotel is the place to do it. ,5,2017,09,17
206,Marker Hotel,This is an outstanding hotel.The rooms are lovely and the decor of the lobby and surrounding area was sleek and modern.  The dining facility is exceptional.  The breakfast is a buffet with many choices and the dinner has many wonderful options.   The hotel is in a lovey location with interesting restaurants in the area.  There is also a gorgeous spa and infinity pool. It is really a very relaxing venue ,5,2017,09,16
206,Great modern hotel,"We stayed here for 4 nights in september 2017. Everything about the hotel was great:
-The staff was super friendly and helpful. i talked to front desk, concierge and doormen on numerous occasions and they were all fantastic.
-Hotel is very modern and clean
-Room was spacious and well-appointed. Loved the shower. We were only one door from the elevator and never heard a peep. It is really quiet and great for sleeping.
-Pool and spa area was great after a long day of being a tourist.
-Rooftop bar is really cool. Had my best irish coffee of the trip up there. 
-Lobby bar was surprisingly lively most nights as well.
-Free coffee and tea in the mornings is a really nice touch.

The only slightly negative thing i'd say: be aware of the location. It's a bit of a hike to the main core of Dublin. This normally isn't a problem, but at night, with no dinner plans, there's not a ton around.

As for food: Osteria Lucio about 5-10 minutes walk was really good. make a reservation. Fresh market right across the plaza is fantastic for breakfast. We grabbed a sausage and egg sandwich on a roll every day.",5,2017,09,16
206,Modern 5 Star Hotel in a modern developing area,"If you like a modern high class hotel in a newly developed area outside the city center, this is a great hotel for you. An excellent Spa/Pool. All the other amenities. Next to a new arts theater. On a new plaza. Everything around is new.",4,2017,09,16
206,Perfect!!!,"Stayed for 4 nights in september. Booked a delux room which was not ready as I arrived very early I upgraded to a corner suite which was exellent. Staff was very friendly, always smilling and willing to help however they could. I recommend this hotel to everyone and if I will come back to Dublin I will definatly stay at The Marker again.",5,2017,09,16
206,"Excellent, affordable hotel","Given its reasonable price, we were not expecting this hotel to be as wonderful as it is.  The concierge is very helpful, and the room is large and inviting with a bathroom that is one of the best I have seen in a hotel.  The area around the hotel is very walkable and near major sightseeing locations.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,09,15
206,A week in Dublin,"The Marker did not miss a beat.  Everything was perfect.  The front desk staff and doormen are exceptional.  I used the restaurant, bar and spa and enjoyed them all. The Marker does it all right.  They even packed a breakfast for me when going on early excursions.",5,2017,09,15
206,Very Impressive Hotel,"The service, hotel wide, was excellent.  There were eight of us with 16 bags.  Three or four bellmen were attending to us immediately.  The hotel was spotless.  Breakfast was fantastic. The hotel is nicely decorated and has a great vibe.

",5,2017,09,13
206,Perfect modern hotel,"I only stayed for 1 night but I wish I'd been there longer. Check-in was easy. The room has the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. I slept for 10 hours! Buffer breakfast was incredible. Staff were delightful. Rooms were quiet, didn't hear any noise.",5,2017,09,13
206,Excellent Hotel,"Best Hotel I've been to for business travel.  The rate is reasonable, the service is fantastic, and location in the middle of Financial district is great.  Not overbearing, does not come across as a hotel, a bit more homey",5,2017,09,13
206,Overnight stay,"We stayed here overnight as a treat for my sister before she gets married, everything was perfect from start to finish. There was even a little extra treat put in the room for my sister. This place is just amazing and I would totally recommend and stay her again. The staff couldn't be more helpful and nice.",5,2017,09,13
206,Great Location,"We had booked this through a package with Orbitz and hotel room was paid for.  The hotel is in a great new area.  We arrived at 1 pm and the checkin was not supposed to be until 3 pm.  we sat and had lunch and still had not gotten our rooms.  I went right after 3 pm and room was not ready and after complaining they came back and took us to our deluxe room facing quay.  I think because this was a pre paid package deal we had to wait for our room, otherwise I've never had that issue with other luxury hotels that we stay at.  I had also mentioned in booking that this was our 5 year wedding anniversary but no mention from hotel etc.  Very disappointing.  The room was nice and clean and bathroom was great with Malin & Goetz amenities.  heated floor as well which was great.  Karina in the Brasserie restaurant was fantastic and shout out should go to her from management.  Other than the annnoying check in process we were happy with our stay,",4,2017,09,12
206,"Nice hotel, give the location a while?","We stayed in the Marker on a Wednesday night as we were attending a concert in the Bord G√°is Energy Theatre.  It certainly a good place to stay for this venue as it is across the courtyard from it.

We booked late, just four days in advance and were quoted ¬£340GBP for a Superior Room with king size bed.  Thankfully we had some BA Air miles (Avios) which brought the cost down to ¬£80GBP.

I live in Belfast NI and although Dublin is just 100 miles away we rarely visit.  I was quite taken aback by the room cost and then was told by family members that Dublin hotels are pretty expensive.

The Marker is a lovely hotel; modern and well run.  I was impressed that it ticked the box in relation to the venue of the concert I was attending but I wasn't that thrilled by the area in general.  Dublin Docklands has that generic regenerated docklands feel that Canary Wharf could pull off but it just kind of felt that it needed a bit more developing.  The hotel is a taxi ride or a good 30 minute walk from Dublin centre and Grafton Street.  I shouldn't however judge the hotel on its location alone.

We were checked in by Stefan, a guy that had the perfect balance of professionalism and friendliness.  He He had recently visited our hometown and was quite excited to talk to me about it.

We were allocated room 510 which has a view over the quay and I cannot complain about the room.  It was big and airy and well appointed.  There was air-conditioning, controlled underfloor heating in the very large bathroom and had the usual facilities such as a minibar, espresso machine (Nespresso?) and free Wifi.

The bed was big and very comfortable and the curtains and blinds fully blacked out the room to allow for a comfortable night's sleep.

The bathroom is unusually large.  As I have already noted there is controllable underfloor heating and there is a bath and separate shower.  When I stepped into the shower I suddenly felt that I was in the movie 'Honey I shrunk the kids.'  Any tall Americans including NBA players will not have to bend down in this shower!

We used the foyer bar prior to the concert for drinks.  We  also ordered bar snacks (club sandwich type food) which to be honest was pretty poor quality but in fairness was not that expensive.

The Marker boasts a rooftop bar and as it was a surprisingly nice day in Ireland we were excited to try it.  The rooftop bar is accessible only through the foyer bar on the ground floor by a dedicated elevator but it was closed for a private party! We also noticed that it was due to be closed for a private party on the following day as well.  Bit disappointing.

Stefan checked us out again on Thursday morning and was as pleasant and helpful as the previous day.

Look, I like this hotel but ¬£340 per night?  I'd prefer to spend that in London or NYC.",4,2017,09,12
206,Amazing!,"First experience in Ireland and THIS hotel set the tone and it was SUPERB! Friendly staff, clean rooms, location is a bit out from many things, but I didn't mind walking. Two blocks from the oldest pub in Dublin and I slept like a baby. Perfect!",5,2017,09,12
206,Great Experince,"From Check In to Check Out everything is carried on with great professionalism. Hotel is situated in one of my favorite spot in Dublin city. I had the steak and salads it was very tasty and drink wise the whisky i wanted was out of stock but the waiter recommended  me to a similar one and was actually nice. I will definitely recommend my friends and close ones to stay at the Marker Hotel.
Keep on the good work, Best of luck to the whole team. ",5,2017,09,12
206,Roof Top Bar for Unbelievable Views of the City,"Stayed for a long weekend for my daughters 21st, all 8 of us were impressed by the The Marker Hotel. The staff and service are faultless, would definitely recommend. The 
rooms were very comfortable and very clean. The Spa, pool and facilities are excellent. And finally the rooftop bar is a must! Blankets given out when chilly and great banter with the staff. The centre of Dublin is an easy walk along the banks of the Liffey and lovely restaurants nearby if you want to eat out.",5,2017,09,12
206,Pure Bliss,"I spent a Saturday night with my friends in the hotel. We got there early in order to make the most of our overnight stay. Check in staff were mega friendly upon arrival. We had cocktails and food on the roof terrace. Beautiful views of Dublin and luckily the weather was on our side. A BIG thank you to Gary our friendly waiter who looked after us so well. The cocktails were really good and the food was tasty too albeit a little on the expensive side, but this was to be expected from a hotel of this standard with gorgeous views. This was my 4th time to stay at the hotel and I wasn't disappointed. I particularly like that the hotel is not pretentious. We all felt very welcomed. I love the dark and moody corridoor to the bedrooms. The rooms are beautiful decorated with the best quality of furnishings and decor. They certainly don't cut corners when it comes to kitting out the rooms. The beds are so comfortable, particularly the luxurious King Koil mattresses (yes I did check what make they were because I am buying a new one!!!). Even the little touches of sending a ''welcome back'' treat to the room make you feel appreciated. All in all we agreed we can't wait to book another night and treat ourselves.",5,2017,09,12
206,Short mid-week stay.,"Can't say enough about the outstanding time we had at the Marker. Right from check-in we were made to feel welcome. Thank you for the room upgrade! We had quality time in lovely surroundings and great food from the new menu in the Brasserie. Attentive and helpful staff, everything spot on!",5,2017,09,12
206,10/10,Such an enjoyable stay in the marker hotel. A little over priced but with all the little extras it makes it worth while for a romantic weekend break. Breakfast was gorgeous. Bed was very comfortable abd staff were all excellent ,5,2017,09,12
206,Enjoyable stay,Our dining experience was most enjoyable and the rooftop bar is spectacular. The rooms are not really that special for the price. The staff are very friendly and helpful in general. The cost of parking is very steep considering there is free on street parking. ,4,2017,09,12
206,Fantastic birthday weekend,My fiance's birthday weekend.  Fabulous hotel in a quiet area of Dublin with very attentive and courteous staff.  Thank you for a very memorable experience.  will definitely recommend and will be returning in the future.,5,2017,09,12
206,The best hotel I have ever stayed at,"I was so pleasantly surprised at the quality of this hotel. I have stayed at other five star hotels before, but could always pick something wrong. With The Marker, I was impressed with the friendly and knowledgeable staff, the amazing sharing board we had twice in four days, and the stunning room and architecture of the building. I only wish the rooftop bar was open. ",5,2017,09,12
206,Marker Hotel Dublin,"A delightful short stay at a quality hotel.  Hotel staff most friendly and welcoming.  Rooftop bar a must and food excellent and reasonably priced.
Located a 10-15 minute walk from city centre along a scenic view of the river Liffey",5,2017,09,12
206,A perfect escape in the city of Dublin,"The Marker Hotel is situated in the up and coming area of the Dublin Docklands. With trendy bars, restaurants, micro breweries, theatres and museums all within walking distance, it's a wonderful city escape to show you a different side to Dublin. The staff, food, rooftop bar, spa, pool and bedrooms are all 10/10. Very urban, funky vibes and extremely good value in comparison to other Dublin city 5 star hotels. We can't wait to return. Staycation at it's finest. ",5,2017,09,12
206,Superb!,"I stayed at the Marker last week and wow, absolutely fantastic in every way,our stay was perfect from start to finish, I wil definitely be back, the only thing I would change would be to give the chef at least 1 Michellin star ‚≠êÔ∏è ",5,2017,09,12
206,"Nice, new, quiet","If you are looking for a break from the busy tourist attractions, you will be comfortable at the Marker, but you will need a cab from city centre. You might also need to allow for additional time during checkin and checkout as they were extremely slow. But maybe that was just because we had booked 8 rooms under the same name. Other hotels have managed this much much faster.
The room was very nice and very clean, although the aircon was set to 16 degrees - not very cosy. I was not sure if the water in the Nespresso machine was fresh, if yes, a small notice would have been nice. The shower was difficult to adjust to warm, it was either hot or cold and took a while to find the correct temperature.
Overall a good experience but if these details would have been up to the standard this hotel should have, it would have been an excellent stay
",3,2017,09,11
206,Incredible,"Impeccable customer service and attention to detail. From the second we arrived with our car the doorman was welcoming, filled with information and very friendly. Check-in was a dream and the rooftop bar is an absolute must for a night cap. The room was spacious and luxurious. We only wish we could have stayed longer. A fabulous property!",5,2017,09,11
206,Perfect stay!,"We stayed for 2 weeks and everything about our room is fantastic! The room we got has a view of the quay and every morning, I enjoyed watching passersby from my window. I was impressed by the heated marble bathroom floor and towel rack, it was our first time to enjoy this amenity. Our coffee machine was a Nespresso and I couldn't be happier, I don't think all the rooms have this though so please check before booking if this is important for you.
The bed is comfortable, and even though the weather was cool and there is an A/C (not available in all Dublin hotels), we were provided a dyson fan upon our request.
All the staff were polite and helpful.
Internet was fast, and I was able to work with no network issues at all.
I was also able to use their pool all to myself one afternoon. I noticed a hot tub too but I did not use it. For those who want peace and quiet, don't fret because they have blocked some pool hours where children are not allowed. I absolutely love this about them, but take note they still set aside reasonable time where children can enjoy the pool too!
We tried their Irish breakfast buffet, and there was an ample selection of delicious food. Price was on the steep side (about 25EUR) but the attention and service from the staff makes up for it.
Overall, the price tag for our stay is worth it and we will stay here again when we go back to Dublin.",5,2017,09,10
206,Couldn't fault it,"Would highly recommend. Excellent staff, excellent facilities. Short walk into Dublin City centre along the river. Didn't get to use the spa but overheard other saying it was really impressive. I'll definitely come back. ",5,2017,09,10
206,Modern hotel great location,"Loved this hotel!  Well appointed rooms, beautiful roof top bar and a great location.  Not right downtown near Temple Bar, etc but close enough for a 15 minute walk if you wanted to.  We loved the area around the Grand Canal.  The breakfast buffet was unbelievable with lots of creative food ideas...and delicious.  Definitely a highlight of our stay.",5,2017,09,09
206,Excellence at it's Finest!,"This hotel deserves 5 stars, perhaps 10. My husband was there on business, I explored Dublin. The staff here are THE BEST, and every person went the extra mile to ensure our stay was lovely. There is nothing like the breakfast buffet anywhere, I'm sure! The attention to detail there is exquisite. This is THE place to stay in Dublin. ",5,2017,09,09
206,Very nice hotel,Great hotel with very kind service. Had a lot of fun staying here and taking advantage of the facilities. Great food and comfortable rooms made for a very pleasant trip in Dublin. Hope to be able to reccomend this hotel in the future,4,2017,09,07
206,Stop over,"Last minute booking due to flight changes.Booke 1 bedroom suite as travelling with 2 young children (fold up beds were to be put in the living room).When we opened the room door(520), found 2 bedrooms! Nice upgrade with a very late check out.Thanks to all at the hotel for arranging cars to the airport.We be back next year.",5,2017,09,07
206,Marker Hotel,"All good. Excellent location and very helpful staff. Food is ok but room for some improvement although I am  hard to please on this front. Room was very good, clean, good size and excellent bed. Would recommend",4,2017,09,07
206,Yeah...No.,"Okay so let me start off with the positives. Love the comfy bed, large bathroom with heated floors, great air conditioner and pool facilities. 

Now to my biggest pet peeves. Since the windows are so large you can hear EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING. 
For instance, there is a loose pot hole in the street and we knew every time someone drove over it. Also, there is construction almost everywhere in Dublin so be prepared to hear it all. We had to make sure we were in bed by 9 just to get enough sleep bc they WILL wake you up at 630 in the morning.

I am currently writing this from my bed because I have spent the last two hours trying to sleep in on my last day here. Talk about irritating.

Also, one of the reasons why I booked this hotel was the rooftop bar. (Mind you we booked this hotel for 5 nights.) When we got here there was a sign in front of the entrance that is was closed for three of the nights and then closed again for a private party for two nights. It would have been nice to know that the option wasn't going to be available when we booked.

Oh, I almost forgot. If you're wanting to be in the city centre with quick access to restaurants and shops this hotel is not for you. It's about a 15 min walk to the centre. We learned quickly to enjoy the grocery store across the street and taxi cabs were our friends. 

I hate to say it but I doubt we will be back.
",3,2017,09,07
206,Excellent Dublin Hotel,"The Marker hotel is fantastic.  The location, facilities, and staff were all beyond expectation.  The view over the water is beautiful, the location is very convenient, and the sleep was amazing!  I will gladly stay there the next time I visit Dublin.",5,2017,09,06
206,Not to far,My husband and I stayed in this hotel for the third time last weekend. The hotel itself is a bit futuristic in feel. Staff couldn't do enough for us room stunning food great will definitely be back the sooner the better,5,2017,09,06
206,Easily the best hotel of the trip,"Great stay.  Rivals top hotels in London and Paris.  Great rooftop bar and terrific overall service.  Tasteful contemporary design.  Even though it's not in the City center, everything was accessible.  Great spa as well.  Easily the best hotel we saw in Ireland",5,2017,09,05
206,Lap of luxury,"Everything about this hotel was fantastic. We had a snack on the rooftop deck with sweeping views of Dublin and the canal. Swam in the infinity pool in the spa and relaxed in the hot tub. The pool area was an oasis of calm. Then we ordered room service (pizza with fresh mozzarella, salad, greens, club sandwich). The room was a great design and the bed was extremely comfy. Honestly we were blown away by everything (and we travel a lot). Already recommended this place to friends!",5,2017,09,05
206,Great 5 Star all the way,"Beautiful modern luxury hotel. Large comfortable room with nice view of the square and canal.  Loved the excellent AC.  Staff all friendly and helpful.  Good breakfast at the Brasserie.  Loved the rooftop bar, what a treat!  We would surely return if in Dublin.",5,2017,09,05
206,Very Contemporary Hotel in Hip Location,"The Marker is probably the most expensive hotel we've stayed at, but my wife and I both said several times it was well worth it!  Wonderful staff; large room overlooking a modern square on the waterfront.  The pool/jacuzzi was so great after long days of sightseeing.  The AC was the quietest I've ever experienced.  The decor was top-notch.  Would definitely recommend if you're wiling to pay extra, but then everything in Ireland/Dublin seems expensive -- so we felt The Marker was well worth it; give yourself a real treat and enjoy a wonderful experience.",5,2017,09,05
206,Great experience,"This was a wonderful hotel to stay at to end our two week vacation. Fabulous experience, the rooftop bar was a lot if fun amd the employees were all helpful and courteous. The amenities were nice too.  ",5,2017,09,04
206,Great Hotel,"We had a wonderful stay, during our visit. The hotel is very centrally located and the best is the staff at the hotel. They were so helpful and always able to provide options and help with things to do. ",5,2017,09,04
206,Quite possibly the BEST hotel in Ireland,"We ended our 13 day trip throughout Ireland and Northern Ireland in this hotel, and after spending nights in 6 different hotels throughout the country, this one hit it out of the park. With the rooftop bar, to it's stunning reflection lap pool, this hotel understands how to treat their guests. Even room service food was an unexpected luxury - excellent, and fresh! The people who work here CARE - and it shows!

If we do Ireland again, I will certainly be lobbying for this stay again.",5,2017,09,04
206,Very class and friendly,We had a very good time in this nice modern hotel. It is a bit excentred but it's very nice to be near the Canal. The SPA is outstanding and we appreciated that it's still open in the evening. We didn't eat in the Brasserie but took breakfast which was very good. The only think we didn't like is the air conditionned which is too strong. We enjoyed the Rooftop but could only test it the last day as it was closed before. it should be opened more often. Everybody was very friendly with us and helped with success to find a mobile our son forgot in a taxi. We appreciated to be in a big hotel where people seem to know who you are. It's rather expensive but you will find a very good service.,5,2017,09,04
206,Fabulous experience,"No detail too trivial, no request is too much trouble. The staff are professional, friendly and efficient, food is excellent and the bedroom was extremely clean and comfortable. It was lovely to return and we'll be back again for sure. ",5,2017,09,04
206,Great trip,Hotel was fabulous. Great location. Staff were very helpful and really nice. Breakfast was delicious and we weren't rushed to finish at all. The room was gorgeous. We went to the rooftop bar and although it was a little dear it was definitely worth it. Would definitely go back ,5,2017,09,04
206,Fabulous experience,Stayed here with work and can't fault the staff and venue. Amazing room service - gluten free burger was fab! Good choice of food - different to other hotels. Staff were very helpful. Lovely breakfast too. Highly recommended.,5,2017,09,04
206,Fabulous stay at a great hotel,"Stayed here for four nights for a family holiday. It is located in the docklands area of Dublin and apparently is a fairly new hotel. 
Check in was quick and easy and we had booked a corner suite. The room had a large Queen bed and a sofa bed. The first thing that is apparent is that this is quite a family friendly hotel and they had a separate ‚Äúcheck in ‚Äú sheet for the children. The children were asked what their favourite drink was and this was delivered to the room! The room had a welcome tray of chocolates. 
The room itself was adequate for what one would expect for a city centre hotel. Very new and clean and tidy. There was an adequate supply of tea and coffee and bottled water. In the room there was more evidence of their child friendliness. There were bathrobes in adult and children sizes. The children also had their own toiletries set consisting of shower gel, shampoo and body lotion. Obviously the children were very impressed!
The turn down service was also very good every evening with an abundant supply of chocolate mints! 
Breakfast buffet was quite extensive with a real honeycomb dripping honey. In addition there were a few items that could be ordered  which were included in the package and a few items that were extra. The staff were courteous and helpful. 
On one of the days, we asked the hotel for a packed breakfast for the four of us as we had to go early for one of the tours. The hotel delivered it to our room on time.  In the breakfast pack, there were some fruits, pastries and yoghurts. It was quite convenient. 
Wifi was good and fast. I used the gym here on one occasion. It is part of the spa. It is reasonably equipped, clean and not crowded. 
Check out was also quick and uncomplicated. 
It is an expensive hotel, but then most hotels in Dublin are. However I would say that it was definitely worth the price and all of us and especially the children enjoyed the stay. Would definitely recommend and would definitely stay here again if we were to visit Dublin.",5,2017,09,03
206,Great location for business,"This is a lovely hotel, the rooftop bar and gym areas are fantastic.

I would highly recommend this hotel, its only a short journey from the centre of Dublin. 

The food at breakfast is great, and service is impeccable. ",5,2017,09,03
206,irish vacation,four days of excellence.This was a good choice by Gate 1 travel.i would recommend this hotel to my frends. Location is good for visiting Dublin.We look forward to visiting ireland again in the not too distant future,5,2017,09,03
206,Excellent hotel,"This is a 5 star property by all measures . I encountered no problem at all during my brief stay.
I do recommend sprucing up the front desk/reception area especially with new carpets/rugs as the current one look dull and worn out but this is just minor stuff.
",5,2017,09,02
206,Excellent hotel,"The service we experience from the time of stepping out of the taxi to our departure the following day was none other than superb.  Literally all staff from the reception to the waiters were happy, friendly and knowledgeable.  We would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely return on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2017,09,01
206,Wonderful experience,"I can't say enough about the wonderful service and fantastic room we enjoyed during our stay at The Marker Hotel in Dublin. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the facility is stunning. The location is great, and the views from our room were inspiring. The room was spotless and very well appointed, with everything we needed, and more. It was the best night's sleep ",5,2017,08,31
206,Good for business and tourist to stay,Professional and polite service enjoyed the stay. Location was good as it wasn't right in the centre part but there was access to various restaurants around the canal and you could walk into town in about 5 minutes or so.,4,2017,08,31
206,Wonderful service,"My family stayed at the Marker following our wedding and they staff was wonderful. There was a mixup with an online reservation and the staff was patient and helpful as we sorted it out, including bring glasses of champagne for us (and an apple juice and coloring book for our son).",5,2017,08,30
206,Marker dublin,"Front facing view from 6th floor was the best highlight of my room but the shower was a poor design in room 614.  The staff were very kind and helpful, the pool area is very good, spa staff are lovely, spa changing room was very good, good food, high marks for cleanliness, nice quiet room which was good for sleeping. I liked the location of the hotel. ",4,2017,08,30
206,Good and Bad,"Good: Hotel amenities, location, knowledgeable and friendly staff

Bad: Room not cleaned by staff upon return in evening to the room and booking taxi service charge not explained to customer which are both very disappointing.",4,2017,08,30
206,Fantastic Hotel,"We had a fantastic two nights in this beautiful stylish hotel situated in a great area of Dublin.
Our room was very modern and comfortable, all the staff we spoke to were extremely helpful and friendly. We enjoyed our visit to the rooftop bar with wonderful views over Dublin and while it was a bit cold we would not like to have missed this opportunity and were given blankets to keep us warm!",5,2017,08,30
206,Weekend Getaway,"Fantastic, a truly outstanding relaxing break. Staff were very accommodating and most professional. The breakfast was my personal highlight of the stay, absolutely gorgeous. Rooms were clean and were extremely modern.",5,2017,08,30

206,Fantastic hotel ...best in dublin,"With its modern decor and tasteful rooms
Staff is v courteous and respectful 
There is nothing this hotel doesn't have 
Breakfast is a fresh treat every morning the ambiance and atmosphere at the marker is sublime to say the least ",5,2017,08,29
206,The extra 10% matters!,"The Marker has thought of everything and more.  The  management is constantly thinking of ways to improve the service and quality of stay for their guests be it business or leisure.  They ought to be congratulated.
From bottled water left in your car to yoga pack to start your day with mindfulness.  This hotel has looked at services from a guest perspective.  The extras has not gone unnoticed and has been greatly appreciated.",5,2017,08,29
206,Best hotel in Dublin for sure,"We stay in Dublin all the time, always 5 star, first time in the Marker and loved it, like a hidden jewel.
definitely be back there and most likely will be our regular when visiting.
From arriving to departure it was perfect, you could tell the staff genuinely loved working there, nothing was an issue, very professional. ",5,2017,08,29
206,Superb hotel,"Stayed for two nights
Loved the property. The location is amazing ,the staff too good very helpful.the front office manager uni was too good went out of the way to help us.very prompt service you ask for anything and within seconds of keeping the phone you have the staff at the door step. Rooms are very spacious best part is the heated  bathroom flooring.would stay at this property whenever in Dublin ",5,2017,08,29
206,Flawless,"Excelent hotel, great and extremely helpful staff ( especially the doormen)- loved the pool area and the lobby treats; will definitely stay here when I'm in Dublin next. Great location, short walk to the city center.",5,2017,08,28

206,business stay,"Great hotel a bit out of the way but only 15 minutes walk to city center.     Located in the old docklands, which are now a premiere residential location.  Hotel has great service and room quality.  They need to fix spa Jacuzzi and shower strength (just a trickle in this stay).",4,2017,08,28
206,This is probably my favorite hotel ever,"I really enjoyed staying here.  The rooms were big, modern and super clean.  Even the shampoo and body wash were great!  We missed the rooftop bar because it was closed however the breakfast buffet and bar food were great.",5,2017,08,28
206,"Good, but for the price, expected more","Very good hotel in general, but for the price, I expected a more cozy environment (lighting, temperature, etc.). Great location, great bar, large room, just needed to improve the general room experience to make it less ""cold"".",4,2017,08,27
206,Great but rooms need road tested.,"Service superb, could not fault.
Hotel & rooms stylish & spotless.

Considering what you pay we had a few gripes. Think it's time the rooms were road tested again to pick these sort of things up;

Robes - had holes in pockets & shed all over floor (see pics). My husbands room card key fell out of his pocket when he was in the spa. Thankfully he spotted it lying on the floor before it was picked up by someone else.

Bathroom underfloor heating - didn't seem to do anything even cranked up to max.

Ventilation - irritating constant noise from vents high up in bathroom that we could not stop. Only time it seemed to stop was later at night. Even then there was a background hum of ventilation from vents in bedroom even though we had air con turned to off. 

Hairdryer - nozzle loose so every time you tried to use this it just spun.

Biscuits - all broken & just a packet of crumbs really.

Complimentary cake - whilst a lovely touch, all I could look at was the sticky chocolate finger marks on accompanying card (see pic).

Bathroom tap - you cannot have a low to medium flow without a resulting throttling noise ensuing and reverberating everywhere. Something to do with pressure/size pipework.

Lighting - poor at full length mirror. 

Rooftop bar - closes at 11pm so couldn't avail of it. Would have thought it would be open to 12 or 1am at least. Very disappointed.

Curtains - wouldn't completely close so was woken by daylight streaming through at side (see pic).

Bar - Ordered White Russian but received Black Russian. 

Lots of seemingly little gripes but all together a bit annoying.  Hopefully helpful for other potential guests & for hotel to note & address. As I said, beautiful hotel & exceptional service. Just think someone needs to road test the rooms now again.",4,2017,08,27
206,Would recommend,"Really big clean nice friendly warming hotel. We booked for a get away... was really nice and the spa was nice, no complaints at all worth every penny... the only thing I would note is that its in the 'business secter' so incredibly corporate, alot of suits stay here, not an issue, just sayin, ",5,2017,08,27
206,Great service,"Excellent service, everybody went above and beyond to ensure our stay was the best it could be. Found some of the prices to be over priced but cannot fault the staff. We used the hop on hop off bus which was close to the hotel but as it only went one way we found that at the end of the day we would walk about which took about 30 minutes. This was quicker than staying on the bus though",5,2017,08,27
206,Nice Stay,"Great place to stay for the nearby theatre, but you are too far (walking) from the city center with shopping and pubs. You will need transportation to get there. Great valet parking for those coming in with a car.",4,2017,08,26
206,Great stay in The Marker,"We felt really well taken care off  by the staff who were very attentive and friendly without being over bearing. Good central location, nice spa and room was great. Really looking forward to returning again!",5,2017,08,25
206,Dublin 1/2 Marathon Visit,"Staying at the Marker was very convenient to the city and things to do but the location was chosen because of the proximity to the starting line of a race we were doing.  Delighted with the hotel, comfortable, clean, loads of food and drink options in and near by.  The Guinness does taste better in Ireland! ",5,2017,08,25
206,First Time Visit,"Staff friendly, knowledgeable
Room was excellent - large comfortable bed
Great buffet breakfast
Booked additional conference room - was ready with staff waiting for me to set up No issues
Check out efficient and helpful with luggage and taxi services
",5,2017,08,25
206,Top notch ,"I stayed for four nights in order to participate in the Rock N Roll half marathon and then explore Ireland. Staff were helpful and courteous and after arriving very early in the morning after an international flight, they told me they would try to check me in early. Although I had to wait for almost 3 hours, I was able to check in a little after 10:00 a.m.  Communication with the hotel before arriving was great. They confirmed my reservation twice and the concierge reached out to inform me of services as well as answering questions I had prior to arrival and throughout my stay. Initially, there were cleanliness issues, but they were taken care of immediately and I don't believe it occurs often. Perhaps things were rushed to accommodate my early check-in. As an apology, we were given a table and complimentary drink in the Roof-top bar which shows they care about their guests. Both the bathroom and king-size bedroom were large. Initially, the heated bathroom floor made me warm, but I later appreciated it. The refrigerator and coffee maker were stylishly hidden. The bed was comfortable and the room quiet. The AC temperature was too high, so they made an adjustment for me and it seemed cooler or I adjusted. The water pressure in my room was poor in my opinion although it wasn't terrible and they offered to move me, but I was too tired from jet lag. Turn down service included emptying the garbage, providing new towels, slippers, and chocolates which was nice. Everyone greeted me by name and helped with whatever I needed. I did not eat at the hotel nor use the lobby bar. I enjoyed my stay. Also, my boyfriend arrived two days after I did, and they called the room to verify with me before sending him up even though I had told them he would be arriving. Rather than be offended, I think it speaks well to know it is secure. ",5,2017,08,24
206,Very pleasant stay,"The building is in a very new part of Dublin and therefore modern in design. It's beside the River Liffey so there is easy access to both theatres. The rooftop terrace is a treat.
The staff were most obliging. It is valet parking so very easy, they even have left bottled water in the car when you collect it.
We had a delicious meal in the restaurant and highly recommend that. Bar food was also good. I cannot comment on breakfast since I didn't have it.  
There were different pillows available which I always like, a well stocked mini-bar and wonderful towels and amenities
I would definitely stay here again.",4,2017,08,24
206,VERY COMFORTABLE,"Service was excellent in bar and roof top bar.  Lovely plush beds. I did not like your breakfast procedure and experience we had re joining guests.  great location. Room service was also great,towels ,turn down excellent . pool excellent ",4,2017,08,23
206,Wonderful,"Hotel lives up to the reputation.  Lovely area of Dublin. Concierge was very helpful getting dinner reservations.  Beds are very comfortable.  Linens and towels are very good quality. 
Hotel is quiet.  No noise between rooms.  Wifi works very well. A lot of business travellers and adult travellers. Not a young family hotel....

We will definitely return. ",5,2017,08,23
206,"Everything amazing, exactly what 5 stars should look and feel like.","The food and cocktails were amazing. The staff were very helpful, courteous and professional at all times. The decor was tasteful and the facilities fantastic. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

Top tip **Make sure you have drinks and food on the roof top bar!**",5,2017,08,23
206,Average,"There's quite a lot of hype about this hotel and to be fair it is lovely, but the spa and gym area are very small and generally quite cramped.

In our experience the food was quite bland.

Overall, poor value for money.",3,2017,08,23
206,Stellar,"The Marker Hotel lives up to the 5 star rating from every aspect beginning at your arrival to check out.

The feel of the hotel is unique as you feel important from the second you walk in.  The rooms, amenities, and the staff were all A++. 

I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2017,08,22
206,"The Marker Hotel, Dublin","The Marker Hotel was an excellent hotel. I was on holiday with my family which consisted of my husband and 2 toddlers. The hotel staff was more than accommodating to all my needs and the hotel was beautiful and well maintained. We were more than pleased and will highly consider staying there again on our next visit.

Close to restaurants and grocery stores which came in handy for us. Also city centre was a 15-20 walk",5,2017,08,22
206," Birthday weekend ","One of the best hotels I've stayed in, staff were drilled to deliver an exceptional experience - that's what we got!

Would definitely go again.

The room was spacious, well equipped and luxurious.

Service was outstanding from the point of arrival, to breakfast were nothing was too much trouble, to the doorman efficiently organising cabs.

Didn't have any lunch or dinner but breakfast was fabulous and catered for all tastes.

Rooftop terrace was an amazing experience - definitely worth paying a visit.
",5,2017,08,22
206,"Quiet and Professional, Cool and Calm","Great find in the centre of Dublin.  

Checked in with very friendly and efficient staff, difficult to get the balance but they nailed it.  Great room, new soft towels and an incredibly comfy bed.  Bathroom offered a deep bath with decent water pressure to fill the hot bath quickly and great shower, again great pressure.  Everything felt showroom new.

The room was silent and very dark with the curtains drawn which made for a brilliant night sleep.",5,2017,08,22
206,Excellent,"Amazing stay at the Marker ! Will definitely be returning. Lovely stylish hotel with wonderful staff who are lovely and welcoming - particularly Vladimir - who was extremely friendly and helpful.
Lovely location overlooking the canals in a peaceful area of the city. It is not far from tourist attractions with taxis from the marker around the city very reasonably priced. We paid ¬£9 to the Guinness storehouse from the hotel 
Can't wait to book another trip to stay here ",5,2017,08,22
206,Wedding Anniversary Weekend,"What can you say about this place? Best hotel we have ever stayed in and the service is just excellent. I did give the hotel a heads up that it was our 10th wedding anniversary and on the first night they had some cake waiting for us on our return to the room. They also had rose petals on the bed. Well done and we very much appreciated the effort. 

Breakfast is an experience itself. Great select from the buffet but you can also get some other options from the breakfast menu. I had porridge and my wife had pancakes. Everything is top notch, so take your time and enjoy the food and coffee. 

Location is away from the busy streets of Dublin city centre but not so far away that you could walk to town in about 20 minutes. Dublin is a great town for a city break and The Marker is certainly one of the best places to stay while there.",5,2017,08,22
206,What a fantastic place,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and although not particularly central for Dublin it really is in a lovely docklands setting which has many bars, shops, restaurants and coffee shops in the canal dock area. The hotel staff were very friendly indeed and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The hotel room was spotless and what you would expect from one of the leading hotels of the world. Also the hotel is next to the Bord Gais Theatre, so very handy indeed. We had room only as next door to the hotel is the excellent Herbstreet Restaurant which is just superb for breakfast/brunch. Overall a great stay in Dublin.",5,2017,08,21
206,Business trip,"The hotel and staff were incredible. I stayed here while travelling for business, and it was first class. The staff are incredibly helpful, and provided me with different runs and bikes to do in my free time. It was the best service I have ever experienced at a hotel. The facilities are also very nice and the breakfast is amazing. Will be returning whenever I am in Dublin. ",5,2017,08,21
206,Beautiful ,Lovely modern hotel friendly staff definitely worth a visit would definitely definitely return had food to the room was exceptional great for a special occasion location is perfect if you want to go into Dublin City ,5,2017,08,21
206,Amazing stay at The Marker,"The Marker in Dublin is an absolutely beautiful modern hotel.  The lobby bar has fabulous cocktails and a great wait staff.  And Barry, the Concierge, is definitely the friendliest and most informative of concierges I've ever met.   We will definitely stay there again on our next visit!",5,2017,08,21
206,Just perfect,"We stayed in this lovely hotel for four nights and felt wonderful. From the entrance to the rooftop bar every think is  nicely arranged for guests to feel good.
All the staff is very helpful and glad to assist you.Breakfast is excellent with plenty of choices. The rooms are beautifully arranged and equipped with all facilities.
We will come back certainly.",5,2017,08,21
206,Totally worth it!,"The hotel location was great, quiet enough at night but close enough to walk to anything during the day. There is a Whole Foods type market right across the street which was great to pick up something the night prior to early train or bus tours. Service was fantastic and rooms were awesome. Very comfortable beds, huge windows, heated tile floor in the bathroom. All the little touches like providing blankets on the rooftop bar and umbrellas for guest use were really appreciated. We truly enjoyed our stay! 
",5,2017,08,21
206,Fantastic hotel,We had the pleasure of staying at the Marker hotel for 3 nights and thoroughly enjoyed every minute. What an amazing hotel with incredible staff and amenities. Everyone was so helpful and the hotel is beautiful. Great stay.,5,2017,08,20
206,Excellent location and services,"Beautiful hotel with great staff. The concierge was outstanding and gave us tips for things to do outside Dublin. The attitude of the staff was of continuous care. The spa treatments are great the rooftop has beautiful views of the city, the mountains and the sea",5,2017,08,20
206,"Fantastic hotel, worth every penny.","Stayed for special occasion, having a small function in rooftop bar, which had amazing food and really knowledgeable and professional staff, who looked after us very well. Food was also great, surprisingly large plates for tapas. 5 stars!",5,2017,08,19
206,Staff and Facilities incredible ,"Stayed here for the Robbie Williams concert as it is near the Aviva stadium. You are met with a unique vibe when you walk in the door of relaxation and class, with lovely background music and staff that serve you with professionalism, high level of knowledge on their products and a genuine warmth and human touch. 

Of course the rooftop of to be seen to be believed. Special mention to Yair and Johnny for the making our stay to remember!",5,2017,08,19
206,Miss ,"First class service from the moment we arrived, such a remarkable hotel. 
The reception staff kindly gave us a map and circled all the tourist attractions to visit, the only slight down fall was we was hoping to be able to visit the roof top but it was closed while we was staying. ",5,2017,08,19
206,Great new hotel.,"Hip hotel in a vibrant area. Staff is highly professional. Room clean, modern. Facilities excellent. Definitely would stay there again if in Dublin . The breakfast buffet was very complete. Dublin is a great walkable city and fun to visit. ",5,2017,08,19
206,Faultless ,"Came here on a night away with my (then boyfriend) now fianc√©e. On arrival the hotel upgraded our room as they knew my partner was going to propose. The staff went above and beyond to make it the most incredible day of my life. Candles, chocolate covered strawberries.... the works!!!! My fianc√©e still comments on how accommodating and friendly and professional the staff are. Honestly couldn't fault the hotel at all!! Rooms are out of this world, the food is just delicious and the service is next to none. It's expensive but worth every penny!! My only regret is not visiting the spa ",5,2017,08,18
206,It's all about people ,"The moment you step into this well heeled and luxurious property you get a sense that all and sundry are supremely focussed on your well being . It is classic case of human touch that overrides any discomfort you may encounter , if any .

The rooms , most overlooking the Grand Canal are large , bright and well appointed . The beds are among the best in business . The spa is brilliant and plush . In the true overall sense , the quality of service is one of the best I have encountered in Europe . Each person in the hotel was dedicated and always on hand for any kind of support you wanted , and always with a smile .

It will be nice if the hotel couldwork on the following small issues :
1. Drawers and Charging Points required in the bedside tables .
2. Additional space in the wardrobe is required to accommodate belongings of 2 guests 
3.A small hook is required near the shower stall area to hang your towel.
",5,2017,08,18
206,First class,"This is the second time myself and my partner have stayed here. It's our little bit of luxury in Dublin. Cannot fault it in any way. From the underfloor heating in the bathroom, to the spa and leisure facilities it is truly 5 star. Albeit it is very expensive for food and drinks but it's well worth it and Dublin prices aren't cheap anyway. We ate in the rooftop bar and the tapas was the best we'd ever had. To top off our stay the Manchester United football team were staying in the hotel the same night. If it's good enough for them it's good enough for anyone. I'll definitely be returning to the Marker if I come into some money again lol. ",5,2017,08,16
206,Staff so helpful and a great location,"2nd visit to the Marker and again it did not disappoint.  We had a room on the 6th floor overlooking the front and there was always so much going on in the square below.  Staff are fantastic, from Michelle our waitress in the restaurant, to the boys Barry and Thomaz on the front door and Yulia on reception.  My husband had a dental issue and the reception organised very quickly an appointment with Smiles in O'Connell Street.  The dentist was great too!  
We used the pool area and the hot tub is a good size.
We had the bubble and claws in the restaurant, which is a bottle of champagne with lobster and it was delicious with a tomato salad.
If you can go upstairs to the rooftop bar for a cocktail, its a great place to hang out and people watch",5,2017,08,16
206,Awesome hotel ,Excellent hotel. Very well located and an awesome staff. Zaiga at the reception was ever smiling to guide us to the best restaurants and bars. The ladies at the hotel cafe were always so courteous and sming to give you the best service. I would recommend a must stay. ,5,2017,08,16
206,Super chic hote in the middle of Dublin.,Really enjoyed our stay here. The staff were helpful and friendly. The room comfprtable and functional with superb views over the city. The swimming pool was wonderfully quiet. Cocktails at the roof top bar are an absolute must. Also treat yourselve to a sumptious afternoon tea at the hotel.,5,2017,08,16
206,Excellent Hotel,Staying at The Marker Hotel was a wonderful experience. Myself and my adult daughter went to Dublin to see a show in the Bord Gais Theatre. The location of the hotel couldn't be better. The staff were so friendly and helpful. We will definitely recommend the Marker to others.,5,2017,08,15
206,Best stay in Dublin,The Marker is super conveniently located and the best hotel I have stayed in Dublin. The heated bathroom floor is awesome in cold days and the room is spacious and comfortable with great selection of TV channels. A must go to hotel be it a business trip or leisure!,5,2017,08,14
206,Good but not worth it...,"There is nothing wrong as such, other than the price... It is a beautiful hotel, everything is spotless, the staff is nice and competent (one concierge was particularly nice, extremely friendly but can't remember his name. Irish lad, in his 30s, he had a young child we learned while chatting with him). But at such a price (300 euros a night, not including breakfast) I wouldn't expect any less. It's not enough to be faultless at this level. In fact, for this kind of money I would expect to be ""wowed"", but it wasn't the case at any stage.",3,2017,08,14
206,Second to none!,"This hotel blew us away! Beautiful inside and out and I can't say enough about the staff. Incredibly attentive and accommodating. From the moment we were dropped off out front of the hotel, the staff rushed to our side to carry our bags to check in, waited with us, and showed us to our room with bags in tow. They showed us around the room and walked us through how to use all of the amenities (Nespresso machine, adjusting the heated bathroom floors, just to name a few!). I swear, our entire stay, we didn't wait for anything. 

Between the rooftop bar, lobby bar and restaurant...we couldn't have asked for more. Food was great, service was outstanding!

More hotels should take some notes from The Marker. I won't stay anywhere else while in Dublin.",5,2017,08,14
206,Great experience,It was a great experience from check in to check out. The staff are friendly and helpful. I always stay in the marker when I'm going to see a show in the bord Gais. I love the hotel it's a relaxing hotel ,5,2017,08,14
206,An Amazing Hotel,"The Marker is one of the best hotels that I have stayed at, not only the environment, but also each and every member of staff that I met during my stay. The beds are so comfortable, bathrooms and rooms are stunning and the breakfasts are stunning. Highly, highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2017,08,14
206,Amazing,Very good hotel that I would definitely recommend.  Staff was incredibly nice and knowledgable about the area.  Hotel rooms were very clean and the bathroom was heavenly.  Location of the hotel was perfect for walking everywhere.,5,2017,08,14
206,Overnight in the Marker,Very enjoyable stay. The staff are very welcoming. Nothing is a problem. The rooms were very clean and the bed was so comfortable. Great food. Big bottles of Tipperary water is a nice touch. Rooms are very quiet. Perfect!,5,2017,08,14
206,Faultless!,Stayed at the Marker with two other friends and got a corner room with a sofa bed - the room was very spacious and the person sleeping on the sofa bed didn't feel as if they'd pulled the short straw - we all had a great sleep and a wonderful stay Faultless!,5,2017,08,14
206,Pleasant stay,"The roads to the hotel are a bit confusing but there are sign posts.We had booked valet parking and that all went smoothly...there were bottles of water in the car for our journey home which was a nice touch.The corridors were quite dark but the room was lovely.The bed was so comfortable and the air conditioning kept the room  a nice temperature. The breakfast was lovely,good quality produce. The staff were helpful and friendly.",4,2017,08,13
206,Love love love this hotel,"My husband and I stayed here in June and it is by far our favourite hotel in Dublin. The weather was fab the weekend we stayed so we spent a couple of hours at the amazing rooftop bar eating, drinking and chillaxin in the sun. Unfortunately the restaurant was booked out for the time we needed - Evita was on at Bord Gais and we were going to see Robbie Williams at Aviva - so we had room service. The rooms are large and well appointed with fabulous views over the square and water. The staff were all very friendly and efficient and the breakfast was fab too. Didn't get to use the pool but will definitely be back!",5,2017,08,13
206,Excellent Hotel,The Marker has great staff.  When you check in they walk you right to the elevator and ensure everything is set for your stay.  The rooms are large and quiet.  The staff take great care in their evening turndown and cleaning service.  The Marker is the best hotel I have stayed in in Dublin.,5,2017,08,13
206,Just book here. Stop looking anywhere else!,"There is no other hotel in Dublin which provides you with more modern amenities. It's QUIET for sleeping, yet he bar downstairs is always buzzing with energy. The housekeeping staff is second to none. Our room was serviced twice daily. The beds are incredibly comfortable. The area is so unique. You can see out your hotel window to the top tech company buildings in the world. The Bord Gais Energy Theater is practically in the lobby it's so close.

I researched hotels/neighborhoods in Dublin for months before our trip. I narrowed it down to The Merrion, The Westbury and the Marker. We visited the westbury and the merrion during our trip for drinks and dinner. We are so glad we chose The Marker to stay. It is out of the busy tourist areas, but yet they are still a short walk or cheap cab fare away (7-10 euro). The docklands area is a remarkable sight as well. The three tourist buses stop around the corner if you desire that. 

And the buffet breakfast....wow. 

Make sure you have a meal at Osteria Lucio, which is about 5 minute walk away. Casual and delicious meal. ",5,2017,08,12
206,Excellent hotel with great helpful friendly staff,"Had a great stay at the hotel from check in to check out. The staff were not only extremely friendly but very helpful with assisting us with our car trouble (flat tire) and recommending touring and restaurant options. Beautiful hotel with great upkeep. Only slight issue was with the breakfast selection which wasn't vast and lacked fresh vegetables. Nonetheless, will highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin",5,2017,08,12
206,Nice place in a nice city,Book there and go back! A nice spot to relax and enjoy the city close to the city. Definitely a place I will go back next time I will be in town. Located in a new area of the city with every convenience needed to enjoy yourself.,5,2017,08,11
206,Favorite hotel in Dublin,"The Marker is a 5 star hotel from the minute you walk into the lobby.  The service is second to none, the check in process delightful remembering you if you stay frequently.  The rooms are sizeable with very comfortable amenities.  Bathrooms are modern updated with radiant flooring.  Restaurant has great breakfast options and the bar has a nice whiskey selection.  No doubt this is my hands down favorite hotel in Dublin.  ",5,2017,08,11
206,First time to Dublin,We loved The Marker!  The location is great.. close to everything but not too close.. you felt as though you were in an exclusive area on the water and only a short 15 MINUTES walk to Grafton Street. Service /staff was EXCELLENT.. Loved the spa and rooftop bar. We will be back! ,5,2017,08,10
206,The MARKER HOTEL,"Excellent service and staff so helpful. Will definitely return!
Loved the little treat left in our room for wedding anniversary.
Unfortunately we were unable to go up to rooftop bar as when we arrived back to hotel it had closed which was disappointing.",5,2017,08,10
206,A good hotel but left a bit sad about items that were lost in my room,"I always enjoy staying the Marker, it's right next to my office.  The feeling is very modern and chic, sort of like a W hotel but with more personal distinction.  I like the big rooms and most of all the BIG bathtub!  

Two things perturbed me a bit in this stay:
1. Forgot Wristbands in my hotel Room and they ended up not being found.  Very strange.
2. Was told to wait inside for Taxis, although a line of Taxis was outside.. what's the holdup?",3,2017,08,10
206,Anniversary treat,Very good overall but getting access to the rooftop bar was made very difficult and.  We were told to wait up to 40 mins for access which was excessive and resulted in us going elsewhere. This was disappointing as the rooftop bar was a big draw when choosing the marker. The hotel itself is lovely and staff were very helpful.,4,2017,08,10
206,Outstanding,"The Marker is an outstanding and modern facility with outstanding employees. Gabriel and Robert were excellent! We felt well cared for during our stay, When we walked out of the hotel one day, into the rain, with raincoats, one of the employees ran after us and gave us an umbrella. Very sweet and thoughtful!",5,2017,08,10
206,Enjoyable stay.,"Great location in Dublin. Near the CCD. All staff were pleasant and willing to assist us. Snacks in the Marker bar were appreciated and very tasty. One issue, my husband received a 'bad' pint of Guinness, he mentioned this to bartender, and ordered a different drink, He was charged for the Guinness that he was unable to drink.",5,2017,08,09
206,Recommend+++++,This is one of the best hotels I've stayed in. I chose this hotel for it's proximity to the RDS arena. The hotel looks out on to a vibrant area which is busy during the day with office workers but very quiet at night. There are amenities close but the hotel offers many services and will do their best to source what you need. We were surprised to find how wonderful the staff were and how eager they were to help us with anything. The spa was the icing of the cake as it was the perfect relaxation after our flight. Our room was bright and the bathroom was a great side and both were brilliantly furbished. (Great mattress) I would happily stay again.,5,2017,08,09
206,King of the Mountain,We enjoyed our stay at the Marker. We arrived from Boston at 9AM and the room was ready for us to drop off our stuff and take a shower. The hotel is in a great location. It took us 15-20 minutes (walk) to get to Temple Bar for drinks and dinner. The breakfast was awesome. ,5,2017,08,09
206,Gorgeous hotel,The Marker is a really gorgeous hotel and we had a most luxurious stay. The location is great and the rooms are very comfortable. The staff are all great and very helpful. I'd highly recommend The Marker Hotel as a treat. ,5,2017,08,09
206,A Grand Hotel!,"I decided to stay at this hotel on my first trip to Dublin, knowing I was in for a real treat. This hotel is located in the heart of the Grand Canal Dock or ""Silicone Docks"" with Facebook Headquarters and other tech companies in the area. But if that doesn't interest you, the square out front on the water is a gorgeous view for recharging. Shops are minutes away as well. The room was luxurious, spotless and has a Nespresso machine for coffee fans. The staff are very friendly and welcoming and will provide you with anything you forgot at home. Irish people have got to be one of the friendliest folk I know, but I could be biased. I used the spa, which had everything you need. The rooftop bar was closed due to an event but they served great cocktails at the main bar, fantastic but not cheap. Worth a revisit!",5,2017,08,09
206,Stellar accommodations and service ,"We stayed at the Marker as our first stop in Ireland as part of a 10 day trip.  We were greeted warmly and promptly checked into our room upon arrival.  The front desk, valet and bell service were very efficient--we were in our room with our bags and the car valet parked within 5 minutes of pulling up to the hotel.  

We booked a Suite which had nice views of the adjacent Bord Gais Energy Theatre.  The room was nicely appointed and a good size.  Toiletries were of a high caliber (I'm blanking on the brand).  

Temple Bar, Dublin Castle, Trinity College and other sites are 20+ minutes by foot but we took a cab for under 10 euros.

We used the hotel as a base to visit Northern Ireland on a day trip to Belfast, the Giant's Causeway and Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge.

Overall, excellent accommodations and service!",5,2017,08,08
206,The best hotel in Dublin,I travel with my friend and we have stayed in different hotels. The Marker was the best hotel we have ever stayed in. I would highly recommend to friends and family.  All of our needs were met.  I was very impressed.,5,2017,08,08
206,Miss,"Good Hotel Only no signs to Find Hotel is hard it small blue Sings are Not very good When Driving You Need to put up Signs That a Driver can see with having to stop to read If a Driver was going on a wet night he or She might See them signs 

",3,2017,08,08
206,Hotel was just amazing,"Stayed here for a hen party last week, from the minute we checked in to the minute we checked out everyone was just so helpful and lovely, hotel is spotless and so modern! Door staff were so helpful from booking taxis to giving you umbrellas would certainly stay here again ",5,2017,08,08
206,The perfect weekend,"Stayed for our tenth wedding anniversary on the recommendation of a friend. Can't fault anything about the hotel - facilities, staff, food etc all excellent. They went out of their way to make us feel welcome with added touches like cupcakes and rose petals in the room. Easily the best hotel spa we've visited too. ",5,2017,08,08
206,Dublin trip,"We stayed at the Marker Hotel Dublin for 2 nights for my business trip.  it was an excellent experience.  the hotel was modern and clean, the service was excellent, the staff were friendly and helpful.  whenever we made a request, the staff took care of it right away.  During the first night of the stay, the music from the roof top bar above my room was quite loud.  They immediately changed us to another room on another floor.  Definitely recommend this hotel and will go back again if I am in Dublin again.",5,2017,08,07
206,A first class hotel,"A modern hotel with first class ""traditional"" service standards.  The rooms are clean, modern and spacious - even with a proper iron for fellow crease freaks!  The restaurant is great - high quality ingredients and a flexible approach to non- standard requests, and the bar delivers fantastic wines and cocktails.",5,2017,08,07
206,Service is outstanding,"bar staff and receptionists were very polite and helpful.Food is great,drinks were great and the rooms are great.Spa is lovely and quite never too busy and is very relaxing.You definitely pay for what you get.Great hotel ",5,2017,08,07
206,Perfect 5* star experience,"This is my second time visiting The Marker. It's an incredible hotel with outstanding service start to finish. Every member of the team is friendly, welcoming, warm and so helpful. I've never experienced such brilliant service anywhere in the world. Thank you to all at the brilliant Marker! We will definitely be back! ",5,2017,08,07
206,The hotel is very comfortable,"The hotel is very comfortable (bad, room is clean and modern, room equipment is great, room service service is excellent), it is very easy to get to the hotel by bus. 
A lot of places with food around. I would definitely recommend this hotel for stay.                                                                                                                                ",5,2017,08,07
206,Fantastic hotel and  superior staff,"What a 5 star way to launch a trip to Ireland!  Beautiful hotel only outshadowed by their staff and customer service!  Treat yourself to a stay and experience this wonderful property.  Sit on the front patio and watch Dubliners go by with a cold Guiness or glass of wine or, indulge and toast the town from the roof top bar with a spectacular view of the city.

I miss the Marker already!",5,2017,08,06
206,Modern and lovely Hotel,A very modern and top-otic hotel !!!  We enjoyed our stay very much.  The service was top-rate -- everything was top-rate.  We would definitely recommend this hotel.  The staff was very helpful in booking tourist tickets. ,5,2017,08,05
206,Great hotel in the artsy part of Dublin,"Absolutely loved the Marker.  The room, bathroom and amenities were top notch.  The bar has a great selection and their complimentary nuts are so good!! Service is top of the line.  I was so happy that my Dad, who was traveling with us, took advantage of the tub to relax and loved the shower!!  Great views, great staff.  A++++++",5,2017,08,05
206,Faultless,"Even in good hotels I usually find some little niggly detail that wasn't quite right but I can honestly say this hotel was faultless. We flew into Dublin early and taxied to the hotel arriving 10.00am expecting to bag check, but we were able to check in immediately and access our room. The hotel must be very new it was spotless and everything felt new and fresh. The outlook was good, the facilities were good - we didn't have breakfast there so can't comment on that but there was a great caf√© 50 yards away. It is a little bit further out of the city centre but we walked in about 20 minutes or a cab would take no time. The staff were helpful and friendly, room spacious, bathroom really gorgeous with big shower and a bath, tea-making facilities and a fridge, good storage space, just all perfect.",5,2017,08,04
206,Deluxe accommodation with friendly service,"My wife and I stayed at The Marker Hotel in Dublin twice during our trip throughout the British Isles. It is five star accommodation with very friendly and helpful staff. The location is a newly developing area by the canal, river and docks. We found that the price of the hotel and parking was quite high even using discounts provided through booking.com.",4,2017,08,04
206,Our Stay,"My wife and I loved our stay st The Marker !!
We started our vacation in Ireland at The Marker for 3 days
And finished our vacation here
All the staff were excellent!!
5 Star
The roof bar is outstanding 
We will return",5,2017,08,03
206,Awesome Hotel: You GET what you pay for.,"Absolutely no complaints.  From Check in to check out to the room service and to the people who service your room, everyone was excellent.  My wife left a 50Euro bill on the night stand for a couple of days and it never disappeared. They were honest and friendly. A great stay and worth the price.",5,2017,08,03
206,Amazing hotel,"The Marker hotel is in a beautiful location allowing us to walk everywhere in Dublin.
The room was spacious and had a  very luxurious bathroom.
The Spa was great with a beautiful pool,whirlpool and 2 saunas ,both wet and dry.
We ordered room service several times and it was excellent with fast service and a reasonable price.",5,2017,08,02
206,Amazing from start to finish!,"Greeted by friendly staff as we pulled up in car who took our luggage and brought us to reception where equally friendly staff checked us in and brought us to our room. I had emailed previously to mention that we were staying for our honeymoon night and the hotel kindly sent us some cupcakes and a note thanking us for choosing their hotel for our honeymoon. Room was spotless and my husband enjoyed the Nespresso coffee machine. We also had a great view and the bathroom was huge, massive shower lovely soaps. Food in bar was exceptional, staff again very friendly and helpful. After our night out we arrived back to find the staff had dimmed the lights, arranged rose petals on the bed and made swan towels! Such a kind gesture. Ordered breakfast in the room which was amazing. Pool was incredible, steam room and sauna definitely worth a visit. Overall best hotel experience I have ever had! Great attention to detail, would recommend to anyone.",5,2017,08,02
206,One night stay,"Not a bad word.
Staff were great.
Rooftop bar was nice.
Location is great.
Pool and gym great.
Overall great. 
I gave 3 out of 5 for value, because naturally it's expensive to get such a great hotel and 5 star treatment",5,2017,08,02
206,highly recommend,"This is a 5 star hotel in terms of service and amenities. The staff is exemplary. The food is excellent with many locally sourced sections. My only request is for windows that allow fresh air. After a 5 night stay, I was craving fresh air in the room.",5,2017,08,02
206,Weekend in Dublin,"Stayed in the Marker just one night. Expensive but completely worth it - the spa and rooftop are unlike anything you can find in Dublin. Also, the staff was very helpful with early check-in and luggage storage. ",5,2017,08,01
206,Great soundproofing,"Soundproofing is one of the most important criteria in our book, and we were very happy with this hotel. Our alarm clock was just about the only thing that disturbed our mornings. We know we had a neighbor on at least one side, but we never heard a thing. Also, virtually no noise from the hallway. Housekeeping is very quiet and professional. 

The hotel is very new, and everything is still nice and shiny (really gorgeous bathroom). Space for clothes is rather tight, but that's about the only small issue we had. We had a room with a partial view of the canal, and loved having coffee there in the morning. Also, beautiful views at night. Definitely worth the extra money.",5,2017,08,01
206,SUPERB,"staff, rooms, bar, food , pool were superb
the best weekend in soooo long, thank you to all staff they were superb in everyway.
It was very nice to met you Charlie and thankyou for everything, the hotel is a credit to you and your superb staff

206,Beautiful Hotel,This is a great hotel for a City Break in Dublin .  The location was perfect far enough away from the hustle and bustle but still a lovely atmosphere. The service was also great everyone we met was very friendly and welcoming.  Breakfast was super too,5,2017,08,01
206,A drop in the usual standards,"
Hotel is normally excellent, staff are friendly and rooms are modern and quiet. 
On this particular stay however I had to send food and a coffee back they were so awful, the doorman ignored me, I didn't receive all of a spa treatment I paid for, the morning paper wasn't delivered and I was inncoorectly charged ‚Ç¨260.
When I reported all the above I was given a stale ""We'll do better next time"" response!",3,2017,07,31
206,The Joshua Tree Tour,"I chose this hotel as a special last night treat to end my holiday from Australia.  A beautiful hotel that is brilliantly located amongst the fresh development of Dublin.  It's sophisticated, elegant and minimal style was appealing.  The delux room was lovely and bed very comfortable; I would stay here again.",5,2017,07,31
206,Extremely good service in new Modern Hotel,"We had a nine day trip to Ireland, and stayed at The Marker at the beginning of our stay, and returned for the final three nights of our trip.  We have stayed at top hotels all over the world, and the quality of the service is Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton level.  The property is new, and very modern, not directly in the touristy center, but on quay near all the new tech companies.  Great front desk service, extremely efficient management and a great experience overall.  Excellent air conditioning (we're American), beds, amenities etc.  Book a rate with the breakfast, and it could be your best meal of the day.  Recommended.",5,2017,07,31
206,"Perfect location, perfect service, perfect stay","Loved everything about this hotel, from the guest relations all the way to the doorman. I cant fault anything, perhaps except would have prefered non specific times for kids to use the pool. although I understand the reasons why. The rooms were great, internet superfast, i suppose you have to be, since you are next to Facebook and Google!",5,2017,07,31
206,The Marker,"Excellent hotel, would definitely stay here again. Quiet, modern, friendly staff, good breakfast, cool rooftop bar, lovely rooms with comfy big beds, good air conditioning, fabulous bathrooms with underfloor heating. Nicely situated just out of the busy centre of Dublin but very quick and easy to get into the centre - it's located in a hip up and coming part of Dublin next to the water with a few restaurants, bars and an upmarket supermarket nearby - and there's nearly always taxi's outside waiting to take you anywhere else. Highly recommend these restaurants: Osteria Lucio (Grand Canal Dock - near hotel), Delahunt restaurant (Lower Camden Street) and Fade Street Social (Fade Street).",5,2017,07,31
206,This hotel hits the mark,"Four weary travelers walked into The Marker, and somehow, in an instant, we perked up. While the complimentary coffee in the lobby helped, it was the exceptional service and friendly staff that made the first impression. Our group arrived early and Barry, the concierge, invited us to a tour of the area. The director of sales (Roisin) and director of revenue (Catriona) took time out of their busy day, showed us around, shared the area's history and dropped us off at the Ferryman Pub, as we kindly requested (just had to start off our trip with a Guinness). We are extra thankful to them! Other must-know things about The Marker: they have an afternoon candy bar, a Eucalyptus Steam Room, comfortable beds, a rooftop bar, and they are centrally-located. If I could, I would live there. ",5,2017,07,29
206,Weekend at The Marker,"First class! From beginning to end, our stay at The Marker was remarkable! Highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Dublin and looking for a hotel which isn't right in the centre of Dublin but within walking distance. Great location and superb accomodation.",5,2017,07,28
206,Superb Hotel,"I think I¬¥ve said it all. Great service in every area of the hotel, even before we arrived.
We had a great time and if we go back to Dublin in the future, we will be there for sure. Outstanding experience !",5,2017,07,27
206,Fantastic Hotel in Dublin,"My husband and I have just returned from a two night stay at this wonderful hotel in Dublin. From the moment we arrived until our departure we could not fault one single thing. It is definitely one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. 

The staff go out of there way to help you in any way they can, and are all so polite and immaculately dressed. They are a credit to the hotel. We had an early morning flight from the UK and arrived at the hotel at 9am. When we asked if we could leave our luggage we were told our room was already available for us. An excellent start to our stay. 

We paid extra for a deluxe double room that was outstanding in every way. We had a wonderful view over Grand Canal Square and the cityscape. It had everything we needed during our stay. The bathroom was huge and had a separate bath and shower and even underfloor heating which was a really nice. We were lucky to have really good weather during our stay and found the air con to be quite sufficient and extremely quite. 

The hotel is in a lovely quite area of Dublin and is about a 20 minute walk to the center. We used the hop on hop off buses a lot and the nearest stop was just around the corner from the hotel.

All in all an excellent stay in a wonderful hotel and would definitely  recommend it to anyone wanting a taste of luxury during their time in Dublin.

",5,2017,07,27
206,Just perfect,"The hotel is placed in walking distance from most places in Dublin. Really nice rooms and great house maids, they made order of our things, so I could have an overview and find everything. Helpful and kind personel everywhere. Truly a pleasure to stay there.",5,2017,07,27
206,Horrible AC,"For a high end hotel not to have 
Adequate cooling is just unacceptable. It's awesome paying 3 or 4 hundred euros for a room and having to sleep with out blankets. I could of went the south east Asia for a similar expierence.",3,2017,07,26
206,Excellent Hotel all around,Very friendly staff and excellent all around hotel. The spa facilities are the best I've ever seen at a hotel and felt like a private spa. The politeness of all staff from the concierge to the room cleaning staff was a credit to themselves and the management.,5,2017,07,26
206,Top quality sleep in central Dublin!,"Pretty well faultless: Tastefully modern.¬†Genuinely courteous staff.¬†Excellent food. We arrived after a long drive and refreshed ourselves in the pool and sauna. Reinvigorated we took off in the courtesy chauffeur-driven car (really nice touch - we were lucky - can't book, just happened to be free). After a brief tour we walked back the 15 mins from the centre of town for drinks on the rooftop bar- and then dinner. All good.¬†The best night's sleep in Ireland followed : silent corridors, silence outside. These people recognise that as a hotel what they are selling (amongst other things) is sleep - and here you'll find top quality sleep!",5,2017,07,26
206,U2 VIP,The Marker is truly a great place to stay in Dublin. I will definitely be back next year. The location is fabulous and the Staff was even better.  I did not have a chance to visit the rooftop bar but I will make it a priority next time.  I would like to see the roof top bar open later on Sundays.,5,2017,07,26
206,Weekend in Dublin's fair city,An excellent hotel in great location. Very warm welcome shown to me for returning to the hotel (cake delivered to room with personal message). One tiny negative issue: handle on shower door is dangerous and should be looked at.,5,2017,07,26
206,Fantastic Stay!,"Brilliant property, excellent staff, short taxi ride or walk to city center. Convenient to events at Croke Park, good selection of restaurants on property. Wonderful place, great amenities, can't say enough good things about The Marker. ",5,2017,07,26
206,COMFY BEDS,"We had a fabulous water view from room (upgraded us for booking online.)
 Ate in the busy bar/pub with yummy cocktails. There was a young, hip and also a business crowd. Hotel had valet parking (a must), great, friendly service, an outstanding breakfast. Highly recommend the Marker Hotel",5,2017,07,25
206,Excellent hotel,Stayed for a weekend. Excellent service and a very nice room. It is a fifteen to twenty minute  walk to the Temple bar area and to shopping so other hotels will have a better location if that is your priority. The hotel has a nice rooftop bar where you both outside and inside. The service at the hotel is very good and very friendly. I highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2017,07,25
206,First wedding anniversary stay,"No access to rooftop bar which was the main reason for our stay!
The downstairs outside bar service serious issues - 30 min wait to be served warm champagne!
Hotel rooms and the hotel itself are simply stunning, but issues with bar and waiting times need to be resolved!",3,2017,07,25
206,6 Star Experience,"The Marker is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. It's greatest asset is its staff. I have never stayed at a hotel where they make you so welcome and nothing is ever an issue. The attention to detail and cleanliness is second to none and the inhouse restaurant could easily trade words with the finest restaurants in the capital. A pleasure in The Marker and we will come back again, 'next month'.",5,2017,07,25
206,A hip new hub for the city,"from the moment the taxi door opened to the opening of mu luggage in the room, The Marker is a gem! Cost effective, lively, fun, yet quiet and restful, The Marker will be my go to stop in the fine town of Dublin",4,2017,07,24
206,Excellent hotel,"Great service, lovely room. Staff were really helpful and welcoming. Service in the Brasserie was also good, but not to the same standard as the hotel. We felt a little condescended to by the waitress. Don't think I'd eat there again, but will definitely return to the hotel. ",5,2017,07,24
206,Perfect for travelling on business.,Loved the under floor heating in the bathroom. The rooms were spacious. Hotel very central overlooking the beautiful Quay. Staff were lovely and helpful. Nothing to complain about. It was perfect for my business trip.,5,2017,07,24
206,Premier Experience,"We had a smooth check-in experience and our room was perfect with a view out on the docs. A minor issue with the air conditioning was quickly resolved by the staff, who made a nice gesture for the inconvenience (really not necessary, much appreciated and reflects on the premier experience offering). Our room was quiet and we slept like kings. Very pleasant and looking forward to coming back! ",5,2017,07,23
206,5 star,I have had the privilege to stay in some of the best hotels in the world. I believe you judge them not necessarily by the initial impression but by how they rectify any issues. We had a couple of problems with the room when we arrived but these were sorted quickly and very satisfactorily hence the 5 stars. Staff are all very helpful and pleasant. Great to see so many Irish people in senior positions. Special praise to Shane in The Brasserie and Frida on the rooftop bar for superb service and Matteo. That probably means I've forgotten someone but everyone was good. Hotel very clean. Bathroom facilities excellent. Top class hotels can be a bit pretentious which I hate but The Marker is not. Would return and will do on my next Dublin visit. ,5,2017,07,23
206,Stylish boutique hotel in the Docklands,"Loved our stay at The Marker. Everything you're looking for in a stylish boutique hotel. Impeccable service - we arrived early from U.S. before our room was ready, were able to store our bags and take advantage of the pool's shower room to freshen up. Surprisingly spacious room compared to many European boutiques, gorgeous huge bathroom. Brunch is pricey, if you just need a pastry and a coffee hit a local coffee shop. Very trendy rooftop deck, amazing panoramic views. Meant to take advantage of the complimentary car service but happened to be booked when we were looking to leave.

About a 20 min walk to the historic Dublin core but just cross the Liffey and jump on the light rail if your feet are tired. 100% will stay here again when we return.",5,2017,07,22
206,Excellent hotel in Dublin,"The Marker Hotel in Dublin is a rare gem. Located in the heart of the Grand Canal area next to a number of high-tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, the hotel is very modern, clean, comfortable and most importantly they have the best customer service and friendliest staff of any hotel we have ever visited. I loved our room. The restaurant, the food, and the general feeling one gets by staying there.",5,2017,07,21
206,Everything I imagined!,"I stayed in the Marker on a recent overnight business trip. Everything was fantastic and I was delighted to get a complimentary room upgrade. My only issue was I arrived late & had to leave early, so I didn't get to spend more time there üòä",5,2017,07,21
206,John Lawlor's Regular stays,"Great place to stay and chillout.......credit to Charlie and all the team. The room are good, the hallways could do with a touch more lighting, the new features in the rooms work well.Ive enjoyed many stays here and look forward to many more.",5,2017,07,21
206,Best hotel I've visited in the last 10 years,"The Marker is an incredible hotel, but the best it has is the people that work in it. The service is impecable, true luxury but a near and warm type of it. I travel a lot and it's the best hotel I've visited since long time ago....",5,2017,07,21
206,Excellent hotel.  I would stay here again,"We stayed one night at The Marker before returning home to San Diego the next day.  We were welcomed by staff from the moment we arrived.  They were extremely helpful and very friendly.  Our room was spacious - with a large bathroom.  The hotel has a modern and attractive feel.  Located in the dockland area with pedestrianized areas, coffee shops etc.  I really like this place.  I booked one of the special rates online which included breakfast, a room upgrade and access to the spa.  It was worth it and to be honest the price was still way better than i could have got for one of the better-known hotels in the heart of the city.  The marker was just a short walk or Uber ride from the key sights in the city.  If I come back to Dublin I will stay at The Marker - I doubt that I will even look at other options.",5,2017,07,20
206,Motorbike tour stop,"My business is organising and leading motorbike tours. The Marker Hotel was a point on a tour of Ireland taking in a quick stop in Dublin to see the sights and the city. There were 8 of us altogether in the tour group. The concierge was extremely helpful for us organising an executive minibus to take us around the city and also tickets to enjoy the Guinness experience. All staff were attentive and polite and saw quickly to our needs.
I had originally booked the hotel because of the rooftop terrace where we planned to have pre-dinner drinks. The terrace was closed for us on the evening of our stay, which was initially a great disappointment. However the hotel arranged for a rooftop terrace breakfast for us all the next morning which was excellent. We were all very happy with the city view and the breakfast and the special way of looking after us. All bikers departed for the Wicklow Mountains very satisfied with the stay. 
We did not have the time to enjoy the spa facilities.",4,2017,07,20
206,"Great service, vibe and location","Have stayed here on several occasions. Always find the staff to be friendly and accommodating. Great energy and vibe in the lobby, the rooftop bar and awesome cocktails as well. Nice views of Grand Canal Dock. Nice pool and spa services. Staff is very hospitality focused. Room, bed and bathroom very nice. ",5,2017,07,20
206,Fab hotel great location.,Special occasion so we booked this hotel and we wrent disappointed. Would definitely reccomend the marker hotel. thw breakfast was excellent rooms were fab and staff friendly and helpful.  The area is lovely day and night and close to all areas ,5,2017,07,19
206,Service extraordinaire,"Fabulous location, so central and yet serenity by the Canal and near to the River Liffey.  The staff are fabulously friendly and efficient and the rooms have views for days.  They helpfully changed my room so that I could maximise from the experience and the concierge is very knowledgeable and efficient.",4,2017,07,19
206,At the Docks,The Marker Hotel is situated in avery relaxed area. Just next to the Grand Canal Docks. It is ideal for people who like to stay right at the edge of an vibrant city but with a calm surrounding. We really enjoyed our stay.,5,2017,07,18
206,Incomparable hospitality.,"The Gernal Manager, Mr. Charlie Sheil, and his entire staff were gracious, attentive, friendly and took care of our every need. They anticipated our needs before we even asked. They consistently surprised us at every turn. The property is stunningly beautiful but the staff set a new standard for service, hospitality and grace. We have stayed at 5 star hotel around the world, but The Marker beats them all. We are proud to call the staff at The Marker our new friends. We cannot wait to return! Bravo.",5,2017,07,18
206,Marvellous,"It was a very great time spent in the Marker hotel. The room was very nice with good equipments.
All the employees are very quiet, very professional. The brasserie is very good. And the roof!!! So nice.",5,2017,07,18
206,Very enjoyable stay,The staff at the hotel were excellent and went out of there way to help. Well worth going to the roof top bar. Great views of the dock area. Nice walk into the centre of Dublin along the river (providing it is not raining!!).,4,2017,07,18
206,Outstanding room and service,"The Marker is a modern hotel with staff that are exceptionally helpful.  The room was spacious, although a bit light on space to store clothes for a multi day stay.  The buffet breakfasts were great; order your eggs as you want them and don't settle for the scrambled eggs that are the default (both forms are included in the buffet pricing).  Loved the honeycomb and fresh apricots each morning.",5,2017,07,18
206,Good 5* hotel,"Very nice hotel. It's in a nice modern business area about a 15 minute walk from town. The rooms are big, clean, and comfortable. The Brasserie is a really nice design and the breakfast is great. I wouldn't recommend having dinner there though as there are superior restaurants nearby.",4,2017,07,18
206,Great stay when you are in Dublin,Good accommodation everything is just good. The steak in the bar is a little bit over cooked. And the temperature of the showers during morning time turns between code and hot frequently assuming there are many guests having showers at the same time. ,5,2017,07,18
206,"First class experience, wonderful staff","We had the pleasure of staying at The Market during out three week European vacation. The hotel is situated in a modern business area of Dublin. The hotel was gorgeous, rooms were spacious, amenities were first class. The staff made us feel very special. We were fortunate to experience the spa, the rooftop bar and the fabulous dining. The Marker Hotel stands out amongst the rest in all its offerings and a staff that was spectacular!",5,2017,07,18
206,Family holiday,"We stewed two nights at the start of a family trip through Ireland,Paris and Rome. The rooms were good, service was great and the food was very good from the bistro and room service. Couldn't fault it. Would stay again.",5,2017,07,17
206,Fabulous hotel and staff,"I don't usually write reviews on this but I had to after the fantastic treatment we got at The Market hotel.
From check in to leaving the hotel the staff were out of this world, they honestly couldn't do anymore for us.
Our room was perfect, we stayed in room 420, we had a corner suite overlooking the docklands, just perfect.
The food was fabulous, we eat from the bar menu and couldn't fault that either.
I had a treatment on the Sunday morning, I got the Sunday package and honestly the best massage I've had in a long time and what made the experience even better was the lady that I had, her name was Amanda, she was polite, friendly and just made the whole stay perfect for me. Also the food and beverage manager Sandra was fantastic too. 
Myself and my friends will definitely be back.",5,2017,07,17
206,Cool Hip Hotel,"Enjoyed stay, hotel was buzzing.  breakfast very fresh. wouldn't recommend a triple room as roll out bed is very uncomfortable.  Nice touch to room with a lil cake on arrival as we were celebrating 40th birthday ",3,2017,07,17
206,Lovely hotel and great staff!,"Spacious and beautiful rooms. Very friendly, helpful and welcoming staff. Stefan assisted me with my packing while my baby was unwell as I was alone. Good spa amenities although treatments were fully booked. The bar food in this hotel can be be better but I would stay here again!",4,2017,07,16
206,Definition of suite,"The best thing i can say about this hotel is that the staff are very friendly and helpful, location is ok but found traffic difficult mainly due to the extensive development around the dock area. My biggest complain is the description of our ""corner suite"" if the management read these reviews I suggest you look up the definition of suite in the dictionary, our room (434) was nothing more than a smallish room, no sofa no sitting area hardly enough room to put a rollaway bed in for our daughter. Aircon was loud and unpredictable the bathroom was very dark (unlike the pictures on their website) As a regular visitor to Dublin I will not be staying here again unless I was visiting Facebook head quarters or seeing a show at the theatre and defiantly not booking a *Luxury corner suite* !",3,2017,07,14
206,An excellent business hotel,"An excellent business hotel. Friendly hotel staff. To the city center and attractions about 30 minutes walk. For a tourist visit, a bit too far from everything .. Excellent breakfasts and food.  But anyway - too expensive hotel",4,2017,07,14
206,Polished hotel and 99% of staff were amazing,"Modern, luxurious with attention to detail.  All staff bar the brasserie waitress were exceptional.  Avoid breakfast like the plague... not for food but service was disgusting!  Mistakes were overcharge on credit card and charges of 26 euro for car to be setdown for 3 hours.",4,2017,07,14
206,‚òπÔ∏è,"The average hotel.
The biggest problem here is that you can not open not a smallest part of any window, because they don't exist there, and air conditioning does really work well. 
The rest was fine...
The staff is good.
The food is ok.
",3,2017,07,13
206,Marker Hotel -- Not worth the $$,"My family of 6 stayed at the Marker Hotel on June 22-25 2017. While the weather was unseasonably warm, one of our rooms had NO AIR CONDITIONING AT ALL. The temp in the room was over 80 degrees which made it very difficult for my wife and kids to sleep. What surprised me is that they could not fix the problem nor was there another room available for us. Only on the last nite did they offer us another room.  The Gen Mgr sent me an apologies note AFTER we checked out but the hotel never adjusted the bill. While I appreciate the apology, this just isnt good business.  If you are looking for a 5 star hotel, go to the Merrian. The Marker is only priced like a 5 star",2,2017,07,13
206,Short business trip,"Excellent contemporary hotel, wonderful rooms with most comfortable beds. perfect located in the new harbour region. very friendly staff. great meeting facilities and a well organised bar for having a Drink after work...",5,2017,07,13
206,Pleasant and comfortable,"We stayed at the Marker for three nights in July. We arrived in the morning after an overnight flight from the US.  When we checked in, our room was not available, but were told if  we waited in the lounge, they would come and get us when it was.  We went to the restroom to freshen up, returned to the lounge and our room was ready.  We stayed in a Superior room that overlooked the canal and a public square.  The room was fresh and functional.  The bath was large and bright . Service was first class.  If I ever returned to Dublin, this would be my go to hotel",5,2017,07,12
206,Great hotel and in a wonderful location,This beautiful hotel was so well situated for everything we did in Dublin and the staff was extremely helpful.  They not only answered all of our questions but offered suggestions and helped facilitate what we wanted to do.,5,2017,07,12
206,Awesome trip!!,Loved everything about the Marker! Looking forward to another trip! Location is great and easy to get around. The rooftop bar was so awesome and staff always helpful. My husband and I cant wait to come back.,5,2017,07,12
206,First class hotel,"I stayed in The Marker at the weekend for the first time and from the moment I was greeted at the door until I left the following day, it was first class, five star service.  The doorman was so polite and welcoming and the same was true of the check in staff.  

I arrived mid morning and my room was not ready, which I expected as it was early and I was more than happy to leave my bag and head to the shops.  I was told that I would receive a call when the room was ready and sure enough, a matter of around an hour and a half later that is exactly what happened.   When I arrived back, my bag had been taken to my room.  

The room itself was immaculately clean with modern decor.  The bathroom was beautiful and had a spacious shower.  I couldn't fault the room at all.    

We had a late lunch/early dinner in the bar as we were attending a concert and the food was lovely.  A particular highlight was the chocolate mousse for dessert, a must have!  It was gorgeous.  We were fortunate to have beautiful weather which allowed us to enjoy a drink on the Rooftop Bar before the concert. 

Later that night we enjoyed a few drinks in the bar.  Our server recommended a great gin which didn't disappoint.

We enjoyed breakfast the following morning which was a self service buffet with hot and cold options.  Couldn't fault anything.

The hotel was very busy but exuded a feeling of serenity and calm which was fantastic.  I have to say also that the area suited me both for the proximity to Croke Park and for the fact that it was quiet enough to get some sleep.  Having stayed in other Dublin City Centre hotels, you can get some street noise but this did not happen at The Marker.

I have stayed in top hotels elsewhere and can honestly say that The Marker would rival any of these for top class service and overall luxury.  The staff absolutely made it special.  My only regret is that I did not have time to visit the Spa which looks so spectacular so I will have to return!",5,2017,07,11
206,"Lovely hotel, disappointed to be refused use of facilities","The hotel definitely feels like a 5* hotel, and the service is friendly and attentive. The architecture and d√©cor inside are cool, giving a welcoming space. Cocktails in the bar were ok, not spectacular, and very expensive (33euro for two!) Rooms were spacious, comfortable, and nicely furnished.
Unfortunately, we were not allowed in the rooftop bar at 6:00pm on the Saturday evening - too busy! First time ever I have been refused access as a resident in to a hotel bar - maybe you need a policy review. One of the reasons I chose the hotel was the rooftop bar - expensive error!",4,2017,07,11
206,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in!,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in, the service was fantastic (if a little slow in the bar areas, but we are in Ireland, and things are slower there!) and the room was very comfortable, and if I had to nit-pick the shower head should have been a nice over head type to suit the shower cubicle, rather than the angled normal angled wall mounted units.... it's like saying the towels could have been softer, not a problem, just a small tweak that would have made it amazing! Check-in to check out was brilliant and the staff really friendly, the bar maid noted my name and addressed me every time I went back there which was so friendly. Well done to the management team and staff. You deserve you good reviews,",5,2017,07,10
206,Fantastic,"I have stayed here twice on business, and both visits were superb. The rooms are spacious (not common in Europe), the service is spectacular, and the food at the restaurant is great, too. Their conference rooms are massive enough that we even had Irish dancers perform for us there!",5,2017,07,10
206,an oasis wheel situated within the city limits. pleasant walking.,"excellent location and location and also location.  breakfast is lovely with its ""comb honey"" garden is inviting and is a small green space.  No noise  outside with city traffic. nice view of the Samuel Beckett  passerelle.",5,2017,07,10
206,Modern Hotel But With Tonnes of Character,"We had a lovely trip to The Marker which was a fantastic base for attending the Coldplay concert at Croke Park.  The hotel is modern but still has loads of character largely down to the wonderful staff who, without exception, could not do enough for us.  Visiting the rooftop bar is pretty special on a lovely summer evening and I can't recommend the Indian Head Massage more highly - it was so good I tried to book another but they were full so be sure to book your spa appointment  in advance.",5,2017,07,10
206,Outstanding Team,"I stay in 30-40 hotels for work each year and aside from every aspect of the Marker's facilities being of the highest standard, the real difference for me was the way my family and I were treated by the staff and management team.  We felt like valued human beings!  Kindness, empathy and professionalism, what more could a weary business traveler ask for?",5,2017,07,10
206,Business Trip to Dublin,"The staff is very friendly and helpful (during breakfast maybe even a bit too much). 
The Rooms are large and perfectly clean and the bathroom is very nice with heated floor. 
Small but well equipped gym.
Location is not ideal. ",5,2017,07,10
206,Fab stay,"Definitely my top choice of hotel when staying in Dublin - we only stayed one night but it was fab, we booked direct so got breakfast and a room upgrade included. My boyfriend emailed ahead to say it was my birthday and we got a further room upgrade, cake in the room and he arranged for it to be decorated with rose petals. The spa is a highlight of the hotel, we visited twice and it was very clean, the ladies working there were lovely and happy to help when I forgot my locker password and the steam room was lush! We had to wait an hour or so to access the rooftop bar but it was great when we got up there. No complaints at all. ",5,2017,07,08
206,Amazing service,"Celebrating a birthday and stayed just for one night. From the moment we arrived until we checked out we were very well looked after by all staff at the Marker. Every team member was friendly, polite and eager to assist us. We were lucky to get a little sun and have a drink on the Rooftop Bar which is a fantastic experience in itself, the view is beautiful overlooking dublin city. The Meals we ordered from room service and the bar were both cooked perfectly and the cocktails were beautifully presented. We also used the pool area which had a jacuzzi and sauna/steamroom which we found very relaxing. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,07,07
206,Jiggy ,Absolutely fantastic!! The staff was so helpful with all our needs. They made great recommendations for restaurants and excursions. The rooms were spotless and the beds were so comfy!! I would stay here again in a heartbeat!!üòâ,5,2017,07,07
206,Far short of where it should be,"Special weekend with the family, so we booked on the basis that it is in the ""Leading Hotels of the World"" club. Knowing some others of this ilk,The Marker fell far short of the levels of service which a truly great hotel should deliver and which guests paying these prices deserve. After an accumulation of disappointments over the time of our stay we were not sad to leave. And we should have been.",3,2017,07,07
206,"Very good, modern hotel",We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights and enjoyed it.  It was very clean and comfortable but had limited storage - no drawers and a very small wardrobe.  The bathroom was very luxurious and the bathroom products were lovely to use.  The location is very nice but certainly not central.  The service and the breakfast were excellent as was the spa and sauna.,4,2017,07,06
206,Weekend breal,"Hotel is fantastic, made welcome for very first minute, Rooms are really comfortable and relaxing.  The hotel is a great location for Aviva and Bord Gais Theater.  Staff are really friendly and helpful. We had Le Drunch and this was really good.

206,Very Dissapointed,"Hello,

We were  a group of  8 and booked 4 rooms.  We were greeted by a nice guy you  collected our bags and parked the car. 
I arrived at 12 to check in  and to my surprise my room  was ready.  I was told at the time of the booking I would receive to upgrades and one of the upgrades should have been  my room but it wasnt . I asked at check in was my room upgraded but i was informed it couldnt be due it been a twin however I told them I was happy to share a double bed with my sister .I was told  all rooms were allocated already and couldn't be changed.  I  had asked for all rooms to be on  the one floor however no one was close to each others  & were dotted through out the hotel. The whole reason for us staying in a hotel was to move freely between the rooms . My room  was 624 which had a very small bathroom and no bath.  In my opinion this room was only suitable for a single.  There was only 2 towels for 2 people to use . Standard would be 4 towels for 2 ppl.  I was suprised that my room was not at the same standard as the other rooms especially when  we checked in early.  When we arrived for breakfast I was informed that if we wanted to order a hot breakfast from the menu that we would be charged extra. I informed the member of staff that breakfast was included in our rate however I was told it was only Buffet.  During our stay we  had lunch twice  and had drinks for a group of 15 on the rooftop. I found the service very slow during our whole stay. There was a lot of staff on however still very slow with drinks and food arriving.  Over all I found my stay very disappointing for the amount of money we spent. Thanks ",2,2017,07,06
206,Great hotel,"I use this hotel when going to our Dublin office. The service is always great, the gym/spa facilities are really good too and the staff are super friendly plus the selection of food on the menu is broad. I would recommend a stay here.",5,2017,07,06
206,Great stay at the Marker,"First time in Dublin.  Coming after a week in London at the Hilton at Hyde Park.  Pleasant surprise in atmosphere, refreshing and relaxing.  From arranging the pick up at airport every staff member engagement were great.  Close to all popular spots in Town and staff very willing in guiding/arranging specific experiences.  Will definately use again when back.",5,2017,07,06
206,Great,"Brilliant stay, le drunch was Great, drinks were delicious, rooms were beautiful,convenient to the 3arena...just a great stay, highly recommend. Didn't have enough time for the spa however...next time.",5,2017,07,05
206,Hotel Marker,"First class hotel experience.  Service and accommodations were both first class.  Would highly recommend the hotel.  This was our second stay in Dublin in a month and while this hotel is a little further away from the tourist area, we were very happy with our experience here.",5,2017,07,05
206,Excellent stay!!,"Spent a weekend here recently. Could not fault any aspect of our stay, from check in to check out it was a wonderful experience, the staff were fantastic. The food, ambiance and facilities were outstanding. Can't wait to return ",5,2017,07,05
206,Wonderful stay at The Marker :),"Perfect for a special occasion. A really unique and stylish Hotel.
Staff very pleasant and welcoming. (Especially the Valet service)
A long wait to access the Rooftop Bar, but its really cool when you get up there, great views over the city. (Maybe you can book a table in advance which we didn't do)
Definitely recommend staying here.",5,2017,07,05
206,Stay at the Marker Hotel,"The rooms and pool are very nice at the Marker Hotel. It was difficult to sleep due to the air conditioning. Overall, it is not worth the ‚Ç¨400 price tag, (without breakfast, plus an additional ‚Ç¨24 to park your car). ",3,2017,07,05
206,The perfect stay at The Marker Hotel,I recently stayed at The Marker Hotel for a big business conference with 100 colleagues. I was extremely satisfied with my whole stay from arrival to departure. Particular highlights were the amazing breakfast and luxurious bathrooms with luxury products. The rooftop was also a big plus - although it was very busy in the evenings and with a queue to access! ,5,2017,07,05
206,Noisy but luxurious ,"Stayed 1 night on business. Rooms are very nice, well appointed and with Nespresso machines. However I was very disturbed by a completely insensitive American family who decided to have multiple loud corridor conversations and lots of door slamming at midnight. And then again at 3am. Joy. Whilst I know this is not the hotel's fault, the noise insulation is lacking. The open plan design is nice but hotels with rooms thay have an inner hall benefit from better soundproofing. I could also hear lots of bathroom noise from this family. 
Toiletries are nice quality but rather blokey smell. 
Lunch at the bar was good, offering a nice healthy bento box option. 
All in all very nice looking hotel but as business traveller my top priority is peace and quiet and this was lacking. In new build hotels there's simply no excuse. ",3,2017,07,05
206,You won't sleep,Hum in the room all night with no windows and air con that doesn't drop makes it impossible to sleep. The only highlight was the bathroom which was lovely but other than that for the price you pay and little sleep you will get due to things out of your control I wouldn't recommend.,1,2017,07,05
206,Peaceful sleep at a beautiful hotel,"The beds are amazing, the best I've slept on in a hotel. 
I'd highly recommend staying here for quality sleep.
The rooms are bright and inviting, and the furnishings are beautiful. 
The gym is clean and the spa facilities are peaceful. ",5,2017,07,05
206,Fabulous night away,"Booked the marker for a night in town as we had planned my partners 30th that eve. 
The marker played a long and let on we had won the stay and had upgraded us to a gorgeous room over looking the front square and river. Was superb. ",5,2017,07,04
206,Excellent stay at the Marker Hotel,"Great hotel, with very helpful staff, and a luxurious spa. I particularly enjoyed the swimming pool, but also enjoyed staying in the room, which was very comfortable and well equipped. I would really recommend the Marker to anyone staying in Dublin",5,2017,07,04
206,Nice business hotel,Business hotel outside city center. Rooms are large and clean. Nice spa and pool area with a great rooftop bar that gets full quickly. It's a nice place to stay but wanted to charge 150 euro for a car to bring us to Temple Bar area. We walked it twice with no issue. I read on the site they had a complimentary driver so not sure why the charge.,4,2017,07,04
206,An amazing modern hotel with old world service.,What an amazing hotel.  From the minute we arrived until we left we were made feel amazing.  The service is second to none.  The room had an amazing view and was a great size.  Everything that you could need was there.  Good and cocktails are to die for.  This was a special weekend for myself and my husband and we were defiantly made to feel special.  I will definitely be staying again.  Thank you,5,2017,07,04
206,Truly a stunning hotel and memorable stay,"I cannot rate this hotel high enough.  Stunning hotel. Hospitality second to none.  Food amazing.  Rooftop Bar fab. 

 My suitcase handle broke on arrival through no fault of the hotel's.  After a fun day out in Dublin I returned to my room to a lovely note and a new suitcase as a gesture of good will!!!  Stunned :)",5,2017,07,04
206,Best choice in Dublin,"New Hotel, good architecture, spacious entrance hall, decent pool, gorgeous Roof Top Bar - couldn't ask for more. - This is sufficient; my Review does not Need more characters. If you ask for more - that's too much.",5,2017,07,04
206,How hotels should be! ,"We were delighted with our 3 night stay at The Marker. Every staff member, without exception, was an absolute delight to meet. From the front desk to concierge, waitresses and bar staff, nothing was too much trouble, they went out of their way to assist and make your stay as pleasurable experience as possible.

Our superior room was bright, spacious and immaculate. The Queen bed was comfortable; I requested feather pillows and they immediately brought some up. 

The bathroom was large, clean and had super quality shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, soap and body lotion as well as the usual grooming kit and shower cap. There is also a babyliss hairdryer, iron and ironing board. 

We didn't partake in the ""honesty mini bar"", other than some jelly beans (‚Ç¨5).

Breakfast was a buffet style with additional waiter / waitress service and a menu for cooked breakfasts if you wanted. There were plenty of freshly squeezed juices, fresh fruit, yoghurts, nuts, seeds, honeycomb, cereals etc... As well as continental cheeses and meats. My favourite discovery was the hotel's homemade Soda Bread which our waitress kindly toasted for us.. Delicious! All excellent quality.

We visited the rooftop bar for tapas and a cocktail; the view was fabulous and the cocktails delicious.

The lounge bar and outside seating area are great areas for people-watching, and the service and drinks a delight, as is the spicy-sweet popcorn & nibbles served. 

Locally, we chose the hotel as it is only a 15 minute walk from the 3 Arena where we'd booked concert tickets. We also walked to the Ilac shopping centre (30 minutes) and temple bar area (20 mins) on separate occasions.

Overall, we can highly recommend the hotel and must commend and thank the marvellous staff who do a brilliant job of welcoming every guest and making their stay special.

206,Amazing,"The staff are incredibly helpful, the rooms and room service are exquisite. The rooftop bar is a must, with an amazing view of Dublin and affordable prices, considering all the great characteristics.
Would recommend any time.",5,2017,07,03
206,nice working day,"everything was well managed, nice spacious rooms, good breakfast, nice employees. I would return on vacation and spend more time in Dublin with my family
I will definitly choose this hotel next time I will stop in Dublin
",4,2017,07,03
206,Fabulous but pricey hotel,"I stayed here for one night on business and I could not fault the service or the facilities. I ordered room service breakfast which was very nice - though not 100% what I had ordered, but I understand what's on offer may change. 

I wanted to stay in Dublin for two additional nights, but just found the price of the Marker prohibitive, so I moved elsewhere. ",5,2017,07,01
206,High standard modern hotel,"Centrally located and perfectly suited for business purposes, The Marker is a fine and modern hotel to stay in. The facilities are very clean and stylish and the service was attentive throughout the visit. The breakfast was amazing with a diverse selection of options to cater all tastes. Everything worked well except the water pressure in the room on the 6th floor. Other than that, a warm recommendation for The Marker.",4,2017,06,29
206,Beautiful hotel and excellent staff who aim to please,"The Marker is a sophisticated and beautiful modern hotel located in an up-and-coming area that's a 20 minute walk to the City Center.  The distance may be a negative to some, but a positive to others.  The staff is very well trained and everyone aims to please without exception.  The rooftop bar is only open in the evenings but is quite enjoyable weather permitting.  Breakfast is a nice option, especially if it is included in your room rate.  The indoor pool, spa and gym are exceptional and are a strong reason to choose this hotel if you plan to use them.  This is first and foremost a business hotel that tends to be busier on weekdays rather than weekends.  The hotel works very hard to maintain its well deserved 5 star rating.",5,2017,06,29
206,Elegant and modern hotel,"Service throughout our stay was exceptional, and the modern rooms the lap of comfort. We were fortunate in coinciding with sunny weather so that we could enjoy the roof terrace. (Sadly there is no shade from the sun...although they do offer sunscreen. I think a better option would be sunshades. )",4,2017,06,29
206,Very impressed,"Fantastic hotel in a wonderful location. Very friendly staff. Lovely bedroom, particularly liked the spacious bathroom. Shame we only got to stay one night so couldn't enjoy the spa or rooftop bar. Will be back.",5,2017,06,28
206,Loved every single moment of our stay,"absolutely gorgeous hotel with friendly staff. food was superb (both at restaurant as well as room service). will definitely go back! was unable to experience rooftop (although heard great comments about its nice view), as well as the spa/swimming pool as they closed rather early to what I am usually used to. again, a couple of nice reasons to return. Perfect location, walking distance to most attractions in Dublin.",5,2017,06,28
206,Very nice place,"Very nice hotel, with great facilities (pool, rooftop bar...) and good food. The rooms are very comfortable. The personnel is very kind and efficient. Overall it was a great stay. If you can afford it, don't hesitate. ",5,2017,06,28
206,In Dublin for Phil Collins,"Had a very relaxing and enjoyable stay at the Marker. Great service, great food and attention to detail which is second to none.  We had a lovely room overlooking the plaza. excellent facilities and very comfortable room. Two things that many hotels fall down on i.e. noisy air con and the incomplete tv service. Not so with the Marker the air con was all but silent and the tv worked a sit should.",5,2017,06,28
206,Lovely hotel and staff,Found staff to be very helpful.  food was excellent and good value for money.  Location is slightly out of the main stream but taxis were plentiful.  Spa facilities were excellent and there were some nice additional touchs.,5,2017,06,28
206,Poor follow up,"Location is great and its generally a good hotel. However, the service was inconsistent and they lost one of my items. And they have not properly followed up.  So my low rating is related to this particular issue.",2,2017,06,27
206,Marker on business,"I loved everything about the hotel except for the pillows.  It's right on the water, which is a nice view, but not really in the heart of Dublin.  I stayed for business so that was not a concern for me.  The highlight was the heated bathroom floor!!!  Service was impeccable. I didn't get a chance to check out the rooftop bar, but it's nice that they have that.",5,2017,06,27
206,"First class service, luxurious Hotel.","I've stayed in nearly all Dublin's 5 stars and for me The Marker has the edge. 
Seamless check in, beautiful room, Drunch and cocktails where fabulous. 
Lots of staff who go above and beyond and the concierge what a guy! 
Luxury at its finest in Dublin's fair city. ",5,2017,06,27
206,Sat night in Dublin,"The hotel was fab, rooftop bar was a highlight, the room was plenty big for both of us very clean and the staff were very helpful and friendly.  While the location is outside the main area of town there are a few bars and places to eat outside the hotel.",5,2017,06,27
206,20th Anniversary Visit,We decided to come to Dublin to celebrate our 20th Anniversary and after looking at the reviews on Trip Advisor chose The Marker to stay with. We were not disappointed. From being greeted outside by the doorman to checking out we were treated as if we were a celebrity couple. Nothing was too much trouble. There was a nice surprise of a gift of chocolate cake with happy anniversary written in chocolate on the plate and rose petals and towel love swans on the bed. Our stay here certainly contributed towards a very pleasant weekend in Dublin. ,5,2017,06,27
206,Great hotel. ,"Second time at the Marker.  What a good place: 

The very well -designed rooms are spacious and functional (complimentary espresso machine included). The service is simply warm, courteous and helpful. The free internet really works, they even provide you with your own VPN for more privacy.  
Great bar, and food.  
Will come back. 
",5,2017,06,27
206,short business trip,"This was the first time I stayed at the Marker and I'll definitely be back. It's a really nice bright, airy and modern hotel with a chilled ambience. Well located fro trips to town on business meetings around the IFSC. The staff were without exception impeccable - polite, knowledgeable and well trained. I had a really nice meal at the restaurant with a friend - great steak and a nice Spanish red wine which was excellent value for money.",5,2017,06,26
206,The Marker Dublin,"One of the nicer hotels in Dublin, Breakfast is a bit poor compered to other high-end hotels but you can still get what you want if you ask for it. Rooftop Bar is not always available so better check before if you plan to stay there or visit in the evening just for the roof top",4,2017,06,26
206,On the mark!,"This hotel is centrally located and walking distance to just about anywhere you would like to go in Dublin. The Marker staff were first class! The rooms were beautifully designed in a contemporary style, but the bathroom confused me. The only place to use the hairdryer was in the hallway. Thank heavens the hair dryer had a very long cord because the mirror was about 10 feet away from the plug in - very inconvenient. The lighting was not the best in the bathroom either. The pillows were so hard they were crunchy. But the staff more than made up for what the hotel lacked in practical design and very dark hallways.",4,2017,06,25
206,Best hotel ever,"Best hotel ever and I've stayed all over the world , staff and GM makes you feel like family - we have sent probably 10 different people from the United States to stay there and they never disappoint it's always one of there high lights in Dublin",5,2017,06,25
206,On the pricey end of the spectrum but very modern and plush,"Its actually pretty much out of the way nearer to the docks than the city centre. That said we walked to Trinity College and Temple bar quite easily being approx 20 minutes and 30 minutes walk respectively from the hotel. The hotel has valet parking which is an additional cost. Breakfast was buffet style and pretty much average in truth, tho coffee was excellent. In room you have aircon and controls alrho they seemed to make little difference other than on or off. Complimentary tea and coffee & bottle of water is in the room. Bed was exceptionally comfortable, room and bathroom very spacious and clean. Could do with more lifts in the building.",5,2017,06,24
206,Short break,"Excellent hotel operated by friendly well informed  staff. Excellent facilities and rooms. We would highly recommend this hotel as one me,bear of our group is disabled and he was made welcome and a walk in shower was provided as requested.",5,2017,06,24
206,Weekend break in dublin,"Excellent hotel , good facilities,excellent staff.enjoyed roof top bar
Lovely area of dublin for walking around and close to bord gais theatre,Connelly station and luas .
A bit pricey for weekend stay ",5,2017,06,23
206,"Not cheap, but excellent","We really felt welcome immediately after arriving and got all assistence we needed to visit the wonderful sites of Dublin. If somebody should have doubts whether this Hotel is too far away from the City: the public transportation system of Dublin is capable and busstops even for Hop-on-hop-off are situated very close to the Hotel. Even taxis can be used at an affordable Price.
Don¬¥t miss to have a dinner in the Brasserie, the quality of the meals is superb.
Thanks for a very enjoyable stay in The Marker during one of the rare occasions to have perfect summer weather in Ireland.",5,2017,06,23
206,Very Nice Hotel,"Excellent hotel just outside the center of Dublin, perhaps a 15-20 minute walk from Trinity College and the Temple Bar area.  The room and beds were excellent, and the staff were very attentive and available.  The Rooftop Bar is spectacular!",5,2017,06,22
206,A quiet oasis,"The quiet room and spa area was a welcome retreat making our stay a sort of vacation from our vacation at the end of a two part trip. Being a bit off the main drag was the right decision for us. Everything was still very accessible, but we could come back to a relaxed neighborhood every night.",5,2017,06,22
206,Delightful hotel!,"Beautiful hotel.  Clean, modern rooms and a lovely location.  The views of the grand canal were lovely. The staff were always helpful and cheery.  I travel a lot and this was an especially enjoyable stay.  Treat yourself to the spa and you will not be disappointed.  I had a massage and a facial and both were very good.  The pool and jacuzzi were helpful to relieve my jet lag. On a sunny day it's fun to sit outside and have a drink or snack and watch the goings on dockside.  Sunset was especially beautiful on the water.
As far as hotel food goes, I found the Brasserie served delicious meals.  If you're in the mood for a steak, theirs is particularly fabulous!  I would definitely stay here again!",5,2017,06,22
206,Good location but not 5 star,"I arranged the stay at the Marker as a surprise, at the end of our two week road-trip around Ireland. It was her first time in Dublin and indeed Ireland and I wanted our last few nights in Ireland to be very special. I took a gamble booking the Marker as I normally stay with some of your competitors (Westin, Westbury) but decided to give the Marker a go. 
We arrived and our room wasn't ready - your manager on duty (Umi) was very apologetic, we waited in the bar and had a drink. I could not charge these to my room as the room wasn't ready and the bar staff would not communicate with the reception staff which was frustrating. 
After an hour, the Manager  came over and said it would still be another half an hour and offered us a complimentary drink. The drinks were made and sat on the bar waiting to be served to us, it would have been quicker to get them myself. They eventually arrived. After some time Umi came to give us our room keys  and informed us that he had arranged some wine for our room, which was lovely.
The room itself was great, clean, big, bright and airy - nil complaints there.
My main complaint we have is that the reception staff were not able to answer even simple questions like directions or information about the car park (taking our car in and out throughout the day and what charges we might incur etc,) At one point we felt like the male staff member on reception was speaking  to us in a very rude way and this is simply not good enough. We were always polite and even a little apologetic when asking questions - which is not what customer service is all about. There was a lack of confidence with the reception staff, so when we asked simple questions (like can we store luggage after we check out and then pop back later after brunch and get them and our car?) they had to go and ask other members of staff. it was all made harder than it should be. we were left feeling frustrated. In relation to the pre-authorization and payment of the property the staff could not explain when the pre-auth amount would be released (AU$1007) after the cost of our stay was paid (AU$1200) - essentially two amounts come out of customer's accounts which is fine- a simple explanation about timeframes isn't too much to ask. The male reception staff member was so rude about it when I asked.  

 I would like to raise one more specific example of when we were left both frustrated and then puzzles. On the Saturday night we decided to have a drink on the roof - we lined up an",3,2017,06,21
206,Wonderful hotel !,"My Friend and I stayed here for a Girly weekend and were glad that The Marker was our hotel of choice. Our room was lovely, the staff were amazing and even called me by my name each time ( well impressed !), there was a great choice of food for breakfast and a great location too, not too close, but not too far from the City centre. I would definitely go back. The only downside is that we had to come back to the UK to work !
Thank you to all.",5,2017,06,21
206,1 night concert stay,"From the moment we arrived taking advantage of the valet parking through to the return of our car when we were leaving the whole experience was 1st class. There was no request made or question asked that was not dealt with promptly and with a smile. The rooftop bar was beautiful (helped by the weather of course), with towels and sun-cream provided for the fair complexioned among us! F&B pricing will always generate conversation but overall it did not detract from a wonderful experience. Something as small as chilled bottles of water being left in the car shows fine attention to detail. Looking forward to the next stay in July to see if this can be bettered!",5,2017,06,21
206,Fabulous hotel,"Everything about this hotel was perfect! The room was spacious, the bathroom was wonderful and our view of the canals was stunning! The concierge was more than helpful and handled everything we needed and the front desk was always accommodating.",5,2017,06,20

Feel a special guest and atmosphere relaxing ,lots of options nearby and taxis in minutes if going further . One or two nights never long enough",5,2017,06,20
206,Professional service,"Great service and a posh attitude make this a very pleasant place to stay. The brasserie had very good food though the breakfast buffet is quite pricy (around ‚Ç¨35). Only downside, the location is remote and strictly serves daytime professionals and early theater goers. It's more than a mile from any selection of pubs or shopping.",5,2017,06,19
206,Will definitely return,Fantastic location a very modern hotel in a very modern area of Dublin . If you are looking to sample a modern futuristic Dublin I would definitely recommend this hotel as a product that is exemplar in its class! ,5,2017,06,19
206,Experience a Country Estate in the middle of the City,couldn't belive that this quakity of an hotel was located in the heart of the city. Very impressed with the interior the rooms and the services. The Spa Facilities were really good treatment that was carried out was amazing and the relaxation rooms were beautiful. Valet service was really good and the fact that there was two bottles of Water in the Car when were going home really finished off the services. Looking to book hotel again for my Wedding Anniversary ,5,2017,06,19

206,A Convenient and Comfortable Place,"I had occasion to stay at the Marker for several days in mid-June. As I was there on business with a very intense schedule, I did  not take advantage of the bar, spa and other amenities, but I can report a comfortable room, convenient WiFi, friendly staff, ample breakfast buffet.",5,2017,06,18
206,Pretty much as good as it gets,"Wife and I have stayed in Dublin I've 10 times. Usually stay in Brooks but the Marker was booked as part of a package. This will now become our regular Dublin hotel. Situated on the canal it is walking distance of centre of town without being loud and full on. Close to Aviva stadium for those coming for sports and gigs. 
It is a new hotel (4 yrs) and they have got the right balance between obliging efficiency with a relaxed, nothing is too much trouble.
The breakfast is superb: plenty of choice and the cooked breakfast buffet is fresh. No feeling of having a bun fight for toast or buffet. 
Room was clean comfortable and well equipped (which should be a minimum expectation for any hotel) but also quiet and relaxing. 
Complimentary wifi. Pool jacuzzi etc fab. 
Views from rooftop bar really cool.
Ideal for couples, spar weekenders/ girly getaways and I suspect those over on business (a lot of businesses around the area)

206,Beautiful property,"Beautiful hotel. Stayed here because it was rated very high and we were able to get a stay 3 get 1 night. Only issue was it was warm and sunny in Dublin and the AC in room did not work and was not fixed even though we reported it 3 times. They brought us a fan and treats and paid for our cab to hotel to compensate but did fix it or offer us another room
 Rooftop bar was wonderful with beautiful views of the city. Staff were very friendly and professional. Not in the center of things but easy to get to city center and in a nice area

After a long day, the bed in the room was just I needed (huge & easy to fall a sleep). The service at the hotel was great, employees super nice. Would stay here again.",5,2017,06,16
206,Miss it Miss out !,"This was a lovely modern and increasingly popular hotel. With delightful staff, who really care about your experience. Rooms are immaculate, nice views over the water. Don't miss the Rooftop Bar.
So convenient if you are coming to the Concert Hall or touring Dublin. We loved it and I am fussy! ",4,2017,06,15
206,First class hotel.....,"Good all round hotel....we knew it was down by the riverside...that was nice when the sun was out...although a wee bit to walk to centre. We were at this hotel 4 nights and"" had a fairly nice view of waterside 
Breakfasts were lovely and the staff very helpful and nothing too much trouble and plenty to choose from.
My only gripe is a shortage of cupboards ..okay for an overnight but we were on a fortnights 3 stop holiday of Ireland. It has quite a large area downstairs for drinks and nibbles and bar meals but we found it rather soulless and drafty.",5,2017,06,14
206,Fabulous Service & a Beautiful Property,"The staff goes out of their way to help in any way possible.  I required help printing my boarding passes for the next day's flights & the staff was eager to show me to the business center, link to the printer & print the passes from my phone.  Very helpful!",5,2017,06,14
206,Excellent! ,"Large rooms. Heated bathroom floor that i loved. But excellent service. Everyone very helpful.vladimir the doorman especially. Nothing was too difficult for him. He was genuinely pleased to be of service. I also had to get some documents printed. No trouble for the front desk. Evryone remembered my dietary requirements and warned me before i asked! Amazing.

Lovely room and gym and pool area. Pity dublin weather wasnt as welcoming.",5,2017,06,14
206,An outstanding weekend away,"This hotel is exactly what 5 star should be! Yes, of course, the price for a two night stay with an evening meal is more than the norm, but was it worth it? Every cent! The service from when we parked outside the front door and were greeted by Alex, to the special treatment from Hani, Mark and others was outstanding. My husband and I felt more than a little special and we will definitely return again one day when our finances allow! By the way, the bedroom was one of the most comfortable ever - mattress, feather pillows. feather duvet, underfloor heating in the bathroom and the little touches....an umbrella in the wardrobe in case of the damp Dublin weather, complimentary coffee in the foyer....wow!",5,2017,06,14
206,You get what you pay for,"And that's a compliment.
Everything just went great from check in, to check out. The staff was friendly and helpful, food, rooms and everything from high quality.
It costs something, yes, but as said, you get what you pay for",5,2017,06,14
206,Pricey,"Clean, crisp and modern but within that category unremarkable.  Breakfast should have been included but the staff were all efficient and charming.  It is always hard to add character to a modern , minimalist hotel and stop it feeling a little corporate, the Marker did not manage to overcome that.",4,2017,06,14
206,5 stars,Excellent all round. Downstairs bar particularly good. Breakfast each morning was well stocked and nothing was too much trouble. Good sized spacious rooms. Under floor heating in the bathroom was a bonus.,5,2017,06,14
206,Flawless,"This is my 4th stay at the marker and every stay I enjoy
more.
From the greeting at the door to the impeccable rooms and public areas.
It's simply in a class of its own.
This was my first trip to the pool and spa which were both very enjoyable.
I live in New York and am looking forward to my next trip.",5,2017,06,13
206,Great experience and amazing spot.,Amazing hotel. Will definitely be back. Staff are so helpful and friendly. The food in the brassiere was beautiful with a great menu to pick from. Breakfast was top class also. Roof top bar is a class spot.,5,2017,06,13
206,"Modern hotel, could improve ","We got off to a rocky start at this hotel, our first stop on our vacation. We arrived at the hotel at 10 am and checked in, and were told our room would be available in a couple of hours (by noon). So rather than leave our bags and venture out, we had breakfast ... and waited, and waited. At 1, I checked again and was told by a different front desk staffer that a room would not be available until 3. Several hours wasted! I made my unhappiness with the wrong information known. The manager stepped in and tried to make things right. We did get shown to a room by 2 pm and were given a fruit basket and a chauffeured car to dinner the next day to make up for the inconvenience. We appreciated that.

Breakfast: we expect expensive at a five star hotel. But we also expect very good. My eggs Benedict, which I had asked to be made medium firm, were ruined by the fact that the kitchen applied the Hollandaise sauce to the assembled dish and then apparently put the dish in a warmer or broiler. The sauce was both br√ªl√©e and curdled -- and the eggs were still runny. But my husband's oatmeal was good.

The rooms were really modern and large and spacious. The dark hallways were off-putting... some sort of style point was being made. The outlets were poorly planned. No outlets next to the beds, and the outlet in the bathroom could not accommodate the hair dryer. At a five star hotel, you don't expect to have to dry your hair next to the television with no mirror. 

There were some other false notes. I had a massage in the spa. The massage was good. Afterwards they took me to a relaxation area to relax with fresh juice and mango ice cream. The ice cream was served with a little plastic spoon. Again, out of place in a hotel charging ‚Ç¨400/night. The relaxation area was also far away from the treatment room, changing room, and toilets -- not so relaxing to have to schlep back and forth. 

This hotel is mainly staffed by earnest young Eastern Europeans. They all meant well, but there are some quirks of this place that are built in and not much to be done about it. 

Location -- it's a good long walk from here to the center of the city. We selected this hotel because of its Leading Hotels of the World credential. We were disappointed in the standard given that high promise and with the location, I would not recommend it for tourists though it is convenient to the new technology American businesses in the dock lands area (Google, Facebook, etc.)

It was not a great start to our trip, though I have to give full marks to the staff for trying to make up for some issues.",3,2017,06,13
206,Really good service!,"Leon in the front door give you a warm welcome and get your luggage, classy, they don't miss a detail, reception area very spacious, a lot of staff working and willing to help in anything you need. The roof top it's amazing the views in there, we had a BBQ in the awards dinner we were there for and it was just great. Bar and staff really good too, couldn't say anything wrong about it.",5,2017,06,13
206,Love The Marker,It's always an amazing place to stay with the location being one of the best right on the Canal. I love the breakfast and the pool and spa plus friendly staff are the best. The lobby bar is very well staffed with excellent cocktails.,5,2017,06,12
206,Fbatastic,"This is a fantastic hotel, rooms are lovely, large bathroom, breakfast was great with attentive staff. Spa pool relaxing and worth a visit. Just a little on the pricey side but worth paying a bit more to stay here.",5,2017,06,12

206,Enjoyable Experience,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel very much,  fabulous bedroom, breakfast excellent.. no complaints and wished we could have stayed longer... we will definitely return to the Hotel. Best place to stay if your attending Bord Gais. ",5,2017,06,12
206,Family stay for my sisters birthdau,Excellent service staff very helpful and friendly overall we were delighted and will definitely use this hotel again for future celebrations This hotel is easy to get to and very central for shopping too,5,2017,06,12
206,Amazing stay,"Excellent hotel. Room extremely clean and very well equiped, friendly staff always ready to help, wonderful facilities (spa, pool and gym). Every time we asked for something it was answered right away. The ""plus"" was the roof bar, what a view from there. I definitely recommand",5,2017,06,12
206,A special treat,"Be good to yourself and don't spend time even thinking about it, this place is worth it! Rooms are luxurious. Breakfast was amazing as were the pool and showers! A fabulous stay, we floated out of there! ",5,2017,06,12
206,If you're in Dublin...,"Top place, beautiful building, great staff and service. It's a great hotel and defines luxury. Not cheap of course but very good value for all of its price tag. Value is quality divided by price and this place is great value.",5,2017,06,11
206,"Great hotel, friendly staff","Room was very nice (except that it had only one working electrical outlet).  Restaurant and staff were great (except for concierge who seemed a little put out).  Lobby had complimentary coffee and fruit in the morning, a nice surprise. ",4,2017,06,10
206,"Modern, attentive staff, but restaurant not up to the rest of the experience.","Excellent friendly staff. Clean room. Restaurant needs attention.  The opening hours seemed erratic and the one time we went for dinner, the smell of fried fish was so powerful, we left. We walked across the street to get take out.",4,2017,06,09
206,Excellent stay,"Lovely staff and excellent service gorgeous roof top bar the room was spotless, the view wasn't great but they were willing to give us another room with better view but we decided to stay where we were! couldn't ask for anymore ",5,2017,06,07
206,A top hotel in a new (to me) part of Dublin,"A contemporary hotel with service!!!   Located in the docklands area a new and developing area of Dublin, which I suspect will become the new Temple Bar , which is pretty down and out looking
Stylish comfortable rooms and a quality feeling throughout the hotel.  A 10 minute cab ride to St Stephen's Green

",5,2017,06,07
206,Honeymoon stay at The Marker,"I cannot say enough amazing things about this hotel! From check-in to check-out our experience was absolutely fantastic! It's walking distance to many of Ireland's great tourist attractions, the staff is BEYOND friendly and helpful, the hotel was pristine, quiet, and perfectly comfortable! We had noted on our reservation that we were coming to the hotel on our honeymoon and when we entered the room, they had given us a suite with great views of downtown and had a baked treat waiting for us upon arrival! I highly recommend this property and will definitely be staying there again if we ever make it back to Ireland!",5,2017,06,07
206,Excellent hotel in Dublin,"Probably one the best hotel I ever stayed.
Near from the center of Dublin.
All is excellent in this hotel. (food, service, cleanliness, general quality,...)
People are so kindly.
Infrastructures of the hotel are so beautilfull.

",5,2017,06,07
206,Highly Recommend,"My newly wedded wife and I were in Dublin for a layover at the end of our Honeymoon trip. We spent the previous week hiking, walking, sightseeing, and we're just wiped out. Before we hopped on our 10+ hour flight back to the states, we wanted to have 1 last relaxing night. I quickly searched Top Hotels in Dublin and found the Marker. We are very very happy that we decided to stay here. While booking my reservation, I left a note on The Marker's website asking if they could leave a small treat for my wife (it was her birthday the day before). The hotel went above and beyond. They left us a nicely decorated dish ""Happy Belated Birthday + Honeymoon"", left chocolate mints all over the room, and scattered rose petals throughout as well. Absolutely crushed it! 
The room was sleek, modern, and overall just perfect. Room was a nice temperature. Bed was incredibly comfortable. They have heated tile floors in the bathroom. The bathtub is spacious for 2. 
We ordered room service, which showed up promptly (we'd recommend you try the brownies + ice cream).
The next morning we visited the Spa. On such short notice, the hotel was able to accommodate both of us for a 30 min massage.  Ideally, we would've loved the full hour and package, however, it was a busy Sunday (and I booked it really really last minute). 
Breakfast Buffet is quality fine dining: fresh pastries, bread, eggs, bacon, ham, sausages, squeezed orange juice, french toast... pretty much anything you'd really want.
Check out was painless, easy, and pleasant.
Will definitely be back!",5,2017,06,06
206,Top Hotel in new City of Dockland,"Top Hotel, top services, very friendly and gentle. Great! Only the walk of 20minutes to the center of dublin is little to far.
Location is great and clean. But live in Dublin as tourist is in historic center.",4,2017,06,06
206,The Marker Hotel in Dublin,"Stylish hotel in the heart of the newly developed docks area. Delicious breakfast, comfortable rooms and a buzzing bar for night time drinks. Perfect location for the Bord Gais Theatre, and loads of cafes and restaurants near by (we loved the Charlotte Quay). It is an easy walk into the centre, and there is also a cycle hire stand with great cycle paths along the river. ",5,2017,06,06
206,Great City break hotel!,"Excellent facilities, the pool is lovely and the breakfast fantastic with everything you could possibly want. The kids loved it as they were asked their favourite drink (milkshake) and two complimentary shakes arrived to the room shortly after. Location is good and the area pleasant. All in all a perfect city break. ",5,2017,06,06
206,Absolutely perfect,"A family short trip to lovely Dublin made us stay in the gorgeous The Marker. Not only the architecture, also the perfect pool and spa, the friendly staff, the exclusive Bar menue, the room service and the roof top bar with the stunning view made our stay a special one. Not to forget Robert the concierge, who helps in any situation you can imagine, really a pearl. I.even stsrted to drink gin, with all the gin specials a must. Dublins best adress at the moment. Keep on like that. Congratulation The Marker Team!",5,2017,06,05
206,Great hotel but problems always occur,It is a great hotel and at great location. In general I enjoyed the services. However there was a water leak in the room on the second day of my stay. While hotel approached the issue professionally it took a bit longer to solve the issue and I had to change my room.  So at the end it was a problem for me. ,3,2017,06,03
206,Dublin's best,"The Marker is a very classy, comfortable hotel.  Our room was everything we could have hoped for.   The staff was extremely polite and helpful. We could not have asked for better accommodations.  We hope to return to Dublin next year, and plan to book room(s) at  The Marker.",5,2017,06,02
206,Great stay at The Marker,From we arrived until we left we found that every member of the staff went out of their way to make our stay the very best it could possibly be. The location is ideal for the theatre and not too far from the city centre. We'll be back,5,2017,06,02
206,Class,"Although this hotel is a bit farther from the center of Dublin, it is well worth a look when booking in Dublin.  We did walk to the center city several times with no issues.  The staff, amenities, room are all excellent.  The front desk staff is particularly friendly and more than willing to help in any way they can - this was very important to us since our luggage did not arrive with us.  It came the next day around 3 PM.  The bar drinks and snacks are all very good.  The bathroom was excellent in  the room - very spacious and modern.  The bed was very comfortable and the noise from the hallway was none existent.  I must recommend Herbstreet (a restaurant one block to the left of the hotel front door - excellent food and staff.  We ate breakfast there every day.  Several restaurants are across the square form the hotel that offer a variety of choices.  You cannot go wrong with this hotel!!",5,2017,06,02
206,Top hotel,"Top quality hotel they also surprised the couple we went with champagne for there engagement. Nice touch... very good location over looking the water. The Bed was very comfy, the bar downstairs had lovely cocktails to.",5,2017,06,01
206,Super Service ,Excellent service in the Hotel. From the front desk to the restaurant and the bar perfect. Guest relation is the topic in this hotel. Well educated employees knowing their job very well make your stay easy and  fine ,5,2017,05,31
206,Spectacular,"Every aspect of this hotel is incredible.. location, staff, food, rooms, spa are all worthy of high praise. I would highly recommend it for a weekend in Dublin. Even though we are from Dublin we felt as though we were in another exotic place! We can't wait to return!",5,2017,05,31
206,"Big luxurious room, great location","Stayed two nights. Hotel is in the docklands opposite the Bord Gas Theatre and overlooking the docks. Its an easy walk to the city centre - or short taxi ride. Staff very friendly and efficient. Room large, luxurious and very comfortable bed. Also very quiet. Bathroom modern, clean and had both bath and walk in shower. Efficient valet parking service. The hotel is not cheap but you get decent quality. Only niggle was the state of the tables in the bar when we sat down to have a drink - desperately needed to be wiped clean and given a good polish!",4,2017,05,31
206,Family weekend in Dublin,"Excellent service, friendly staff who can't do enough to help. Couldn't access the rooftop bar because it was always booked out. Breakfast wonderful, healthy, original options. Very beautiful pool and spa area. ",5,2017,05,31
206,Excellent in every way!,"We absolutely loved The Marker Hotel! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. The food,  both in the restaurant and room service,  was delicious. The room was spacious and beautiful. By far The Marker has been the best hotel we stayed in in Europe. We cannot say enough good things about it. Thank you! ",5,2017,05,31
206,Fabulous place to stay in the heart of Dublin,"Wish we could have stayed at The Marker Hotel during our cumulative time of 2 wks in Dublin.
Perfect customer service;  lovely room, lovely aesthetics.  I so enjoyed the pool and amenities each day. A great haven for a busy tourist schedule.    It was not easy to pry ourselves out of the room to then head ""out"" into the bustle of the City ;-)   Will surely come back again next time we are here.",5,2017,05,31
206,Ordinary,Staff were pleasant but hotel is over rated et over priced in my opinion. I have stayed  in 4 star hotels in Berlin et Dubai that  were better . It was my birthday I was given a chocolate brownie in my room and a chocolate slice after lunch .. I don't eat cake ! Prosecco would be better. ,3,2017,05,31
206,"""Out of this world""","From the minute we set down at reception to check out it was a wonderful experience. Leon on Concierge made us feel so welcome, check in was hassel free, quck and efficient. Our room had a fantastic view it was so relaxing and calming, just what we needed after a hectic week. Special treats for our little girl in the room on arrival. she was delighted. The service was superb throughout the Hotel. From start to finish the same commitment to delivering a high quality service  and consistency across the hotel. A special mention to your reception manager Peter who went out of his way to make our stay so enjoyable. Planning our next stay already and passing on the word in Mayo about our fantastic stay. ",5,2017,05,31
206,Treat yourself!,"Had a fantastic stay at The Marker in Dublin. Dublin is a very walkable city and The Marker was a great starting and ending point for our day. Cured my jetlag by swimming some laps in the very unique pool at the spa. 

Also, as someone who is always cold I LOVED the heated floors in my bathroom!",5,2017,05,30
206,Happy stay,"An excellent city center hotel to be recommended. Location is very good. Most importantly the staff are very helpful indeed, all keen on ensuring that guests are looked after. We enjoyed our two sessions on the rooftop bar. Perhaps the rooftop bar could be covered over more as the weather in Dublin is very inclement and there is very little seating space inside.",4,2017,05,30
206,"Great location, friendly and helpful staff","3 night stay for an event at Slanes, hotel was beautiful an staff very helpful and accommodating. The girls at breakfast were lovely too. Location is good and an easy and pleasant walk into town. Taxi to the airport around 30‚Ç¨ ",5,2017,05,30

206,Returning guests!,"We recently returned to The Marker for our annual trip.  It's as fabulous as we remember. We prebooked the valet service, it takes as hassle out of parking and adds to the luxurious service. The checkin is seamless.  It was my sisters birthday, and they provided little cakes in the bedroom to mark the occasion. We ate in the Marker Bar which was fab and we had drinks on the rooftop bar.  It's lovely there with lovely views of Dublin. 
Breakfast was very relaxing and lovely food, lots of choice. 
We'll be back soon! ",5,2017,05,29
206,A wonderful surprise,"We had read other reviews of this property but were thrilled to experience ,first hand, the staff's great attitude, attention to detail, and excellent service. We loved Dublin, and loved The Marker even more!",5,2017,05,29
206,Except one,"Everything is great about the Marker Hotel. Except one thing. The music in the dining room hardly qualifies as music, and is played far too loud. As soon as the music is taken care of, the Marker Hotel is the best place to stay in Dublin!",4,2017,05,29
206,Jewel of Dublin,"The Marker hotel is a grand oasis in the City of Dublin. Situated in the Docklands area it is a 10-15 min walk to temple bar and a 10-15 minute taxi ride to the Guinness Storehouse. With plenary to see and do in the area it allows for easy access to all of the main sightseeing areas. 

The staff at reception were very inviting upon arrival. Our international flight had us arrive at the Marker at 8am. Our room was not ready. The staff gave us access to the spa so that we could shower and relax for several hours until the room was vacant and cleaned. (Our carry on luggage all fit in the spa lockers).

They came and found us (sleeping in the private relaxation area) when our room was ready. The room was well appointed and modern. The beds were comfortable and everything was clean. The bathrooms are very nice and have a separate shower and tub. 

We ate in the lobby bar/restaurant twice for some late nite fare after a day full of pub exploration. Everything was delicious and the wait staff was responsive and polite. 

Room service was also excellent. 

The spa facilities are excellent as well. The pool is large and allows for lap swimming. There is a large jetted hot tub, steam room, sauna, workout facility with machines and free weights. 

Overall a 'grand' experience in Dublin at the Marker Hotel. Well done. We look forward to coming back. ",5,2017,05,28
206,Wonderful wonderful hotel!!,"The hotel location is great, walking distance to lots of tourist sites.  The rooms were nicely decorated --the food in the restaurant wonderful.  And the real highlight was the staff--from the bell hops, to the front desk, housekeeping and restaurant service people--just incredibly friendly, helpful and efficient.
",5,2017,05,27
206,Our first days in Dublin,"The building and the decor of the hotel are very modern, chic and stylish. We felt very comfortable in the hotel. The following negative points I would like to leave however not mentioned. We have booked the hotel for our Citytour Dublin also because of the roof bar, in order then to find out that the roof bar is only open on the weekend from Fr + Sa, but we booked from Sun to Mi. Furthermore, the rooms are air-conditioned and no windows open, the bathroom there is no outlet for the hair dryer and the lighting in the bathroom is very dark. Makeup is not possible according to my wife in the bathroom.",4,2017,05,26
206,Nice property,Good location in the docklands entertainment district. Loved the pool and rooftop bar. Hallways are dark which could make it difficult for vision impaired. Overall an excellent place to stay when visiting Dublin. ,5,2017,05,26
206,trip to Dublin,"Had a wonderful time at this hotel.
Excellent staff , great location close to the city center.
The spa was a wonderful experience for myself and my wife.
We arrived just after 10am for breakfast, and even though the breakfast service was over, they accommodated us, and we were very appreciative.  Great staff!",5,2017,05,25
206,Faultless service,"From the moment we checked in I noticed how friendly the staff were, nothing was too much trouble. Great cocktails and the waitress was very knowledgable about the food menu. The Spa was a great place to unwind with a giant jacuzzi, it was quiet when we were there despite the hotel being busy, the ladies at the spa even gave me a sample cleanser when I'd told them I'd forgotten my makeup remover. Unfortunately the rooftop bar was closed (Monday) which had been one of the reasons I'd booked the Marker so it would have been good to have known that... a very small quibble! It's expensive but you get what you pay for, great breakfast, fabulous staff and a great nights sleep... wholeheartedly recommend. ",5,2017,05,25
206,Excellent modern hotel,Excellent modern hotel in a quiet area. I was there for a conference and the facilities and food were great - although I did not have time for the spa and rooftop experience. Very helpful and friendly staff.,5,2017,05,25
206,"Excellent, helpful, interesting, interested and informative staff willing to help with any issue.","Room large, tidy, clean and large bathroom with bath - superb after a cold windy day!!
Breakfast was excellent with a huge variety of choice/ 
Room service food was of very good quality and reasonably priced, having missed dinner on our night of arrival.
Position of hotel very central and sitting on the river made things easy to locate.
4 nights for price of 3 made the price competitive and staff/service exemplary.",5,2017,05,25
206,Simply the best in Dublin,"Thoroughly modern hotel, with spacious rooms and outstanding service by all the staff. My only regret was I didn't have a swim unit to enjoy the pool!!
The hotel is in the dock lands areas with vibrant cafes close by , the theatre and great walks around the canal. ",5,2017,05,24
206,Concert Stay.,"Excellent Stay. Room very large for city centre with high ceilings. Gym , pool & spa facilties were brilliant. Food in Bar was very good especially the linguini.  All staff very friendly & not overbearing. Breakfast was buffet with the option of cooked menu. ",5,2017,05,24
206,Party Weekend with friends,"Celebrating a 25th Wedding anniversary. Dublin is a wonderfully friendly place. The hotel was excellent, as was breakfast. Only downside is the cost of taxis which are very expensive compared other cities I have been to.",5,2017,05,23
206,Birthday Celebration ,Stayed for birthday celebrations and loved my stay.  Fantastic members of staff and nothing is too much trouble. Would highly recommend.  Loved the roof terrace for evening drinks and nibbles.  The rooms were spotlessly clean and the heated bathroom floors are a nice touch.,5,2017,05,23
206,Very good.,"Enjoyed our brief stay at the Marker Hotel.  Very comfortable rooms with modern decor.  The staff are all extremely helpful and nice.  Convenient location, all points of interest in Dublin seem to be walking distance.  We previously stayed at Hilton on our last stop through Dublin.  Would definitely choose Marker over Hilton in this area.  No question.",5,2017,05,23
206,Style over substance,"I've stayed at The Marker a few times and each time I get more disappointed. One the one hand the hotel is beautiful. The dark interior reminds me of a W Hotel and the rooms are super stylish and modern . The ultra cool bar and foyer are impressive and great places to hang out in in the evening, on your own or in a group.  The food is great and the drink selection expansive. The spa area is very good and although the gym area is small it's machines are a pretty good standard. The pool is lovely - certainly one of the best indoor pools I've been too, in terms of looks and ambiance. 

Downsides: the air conditioning makes a constant fairly loud noise and the smoke alarms making a regular clicking noise that kept me awake Totally ruined the stay for me. The rooms look great but I found the pillows uncomfortable and left me with a pain in my neck. I get the impression the hotel is ,ore concerned with how it looks than how it functions as a hotel. Saying that the staff are great and tried everything to accommodate me",3,2017,05,22
206,Fabulous spa!!,I unexpectedly had a Monday off work today and thought I would go to a city centre spa with just middling expectations. How wrong was I!! I enjoyed a fabulous 2 1/2 hours of treatments given by a wonderful Croatian therapist who really impressed me with her great knowledge and also her pride to work both in the Spa and the hotel - something which is quite rare to find these days. Everything within the spa is of the highest standards from the treatments to the professionalism to cleanliness - the whole thing was faultless and clearly they have an excellent Spa manager in place. The private relaxation rooms and post treatment sorbet/juice are lovely extras. They also introduced me to a whole new skincare range - I'm already thinking about my next appointment.,5,2017,05,22
206,Excellent,"Great stay, great location, friendly staff but not cheap! Great view form rooms out the front of the hotel over the square
Only one problem - Horrific traffic congestion around hotel at rush hour (Allow at least 40 minutes to travel 1 kilometre).",5,2017,05,22
206,Hendrick's Group Stay,"Fantastic and friendly staff, who showed great hospitality and made it a very enjoyable stay! Great location and large, clean room.  - I'd recommend this hotel to others and looking forward to returning to the Marker Hotel soon. ",5,2017,05,22
206,Overnight stay,"Amazing night in the marker. Service is impeccable in every department. Pool area is beautiful, the food and drink are first class. The room was perfect, temperature just right which is very important. Cannot wait to stay again soon",5,2017,05,22
206,An excellent stay at a top hotel.,"Walking distance from the CCD, this top hotel was very much appreciated and a logic place to stay during a conference I recently attended. Very nice rooms and people that take care of you on a very professional and distinctive way.",5,2017,05,22
206,Very nice hotel,We visited the hotel for a Conference. The location was perfect for the CCD and also it is not far from the old town. The rooms are nice and comfortable. The bathroom is very spacious and really liked the shower. The only problem is thatbthe windows cannot be opened as some fresh air would be nice in the rooms.,5,2017,05,21
206,Great rooms,"The hotel has a Great location, spacious rooms, and friendly staff. Love the heated floors of the bathroom. Nespresso machine in the rooms is a welcome add on. Would have been great if the moviea on demand were not chargeable.",5,2017,05,21
206,Consistently superior,"This was our second stay at the Marker. We loved it the first time and found it to be just as good this time. Large, well-appointed rooms and baths and excellent service. A bit of a walk to central Dublin, but the location is beautiful and there are some restaurants and pubs nearby, as well as two of Dublin's major performance venues. Overall, an excellent facility. We look forward to our next visit.",5,2017,05,20
206,Most welcoming stay in Dublin,"The Marker is the personification of Cead Mile Failte (A Hundred Thousand Welcomes) in Dublin. From the Door Man to the reception staff, porters, housekeeping, concierge, and wait staff. My 5 day stay was a ""10"".",5,2017,05,20
206,Gorgeous Hotel,"Gorgeous hotel, beautifully decorated and extremely modern. Had a fab view from our bedroom. Enjoyed some bar snacks and drinks in the bar in the evening - food was delicious and wide range of cocktails. Staff were friendly and attentive. Would highly recommend ",5,2017,05,18
206,A great hotel in a great location in a city of construction.,"Dublin is experiencing a building & an economic boom. About 60% of the city center streets are under construction & hotels in that location would be greatly impacted by the high rises being built as well as the re-gentrification of the existing building. Our hotel, The Marker, is in the area of the city known as The Docklands & faces the Liffey River. The Docklands is considered the IT & financial hub of Dublin & nearly all of the buildings are new. The hotel is immaculate and staffed by very knowledge and service oriented employees. We had a twin bed room that was quite large with a large marble bathroom that has a separate showers as well as a large soaking tub. We had the buffet breakfast included in our rate & it was abundant in the variety of food offered. We ate in the large lobby bar area for dinner a couple of times & found the food to be very good & service to be on par with a 5 star restaurant. Since we purchased a multi-day Hop on Hop Off Dublin city bus tour..we were able to use it as a transportation to all other areas of the city as it has a stop 1/2 block from The Marker.",5,2017,05,18
206,Fabulous Experience,"Absolutely fantastic hotel. Exceptional Staff, beautifully decorated rooms with lovely views overlooking the grand canal dock. Their rooftop terrace is a real treat with exceptional views of the city and an absolute sun-trap on a sunny day. Gorgeous food and very welcoming.",5,2017,05,18
206,Fantastic service,We enjoyed a great time over 4 days in the Marker Hotel. The entire team was very helpful and polite and we always felt like VIP guests. We cant wait to come back again an to enjoy the great atmosphere of the Marker,5,2017,05,18
206,Best spa ,"This is my favourite hotel, stayed there enough times for the reception to recognise me and welcome back. Almost don't want to get the secret out. I  particularly like the spa which I think have been voted the best in Dublin. All clean and new with beautiful pool, sauna and steam room. The lobby is nice too and I always end up eating in the bar because I usually stay on Monday night when the restaurant is closed. ",5,2017,05,17
206,"Fabulous hotel, great location and amazing hospitality","My husband and I recently stayed at The Marker Hotel to celebrate our first year wedding anniversary and it was an absolute joy of a trip.

The staff were extremely friendly and polite (not overtly, just the right amount) and they ensured we were welcomed and comfortable.

A bottle of lovely red and fresh donuts were waiting for us in our room (Corner suite) which was a lovely touch and the decor throughout was impeccable.  My favourite part was the heated bathroom floor - a treat for the toes :)

The facilities were top notch too (infinity pool, gym and spa) and the cocktails on the rooftop is a must.  We dined at the brasserie on Saturday evening and the waiter recommended to Tomohawk steak - it was delicious and very well presented.  
We enjoyed the breakfast selection too (bonus tip: you MUST order the brioche french toast from the menu as it was a taste sensation!)

Great location, not far from the city centre and there's lots happening around the canal so I suspect if it's not already, it soon will be the place to go.

Would we recommend to a friend? - most certainly and more importantly we'll be back!

Thank you all at The Marker for a wonderful stay.",5,2017,05,17
206,First Class experience at a first class hotel!,"Great experience for a short stop over. Amazing spa, gym and thermal suites access. Located in the heart of grand canal - the tech hub of Dublin city. walking distance to all the best hotspots. The rooms are on another level of chic!

Expensive but worth the money!",5,2017,05,17
206,Outstanding!,"Everything was perfect from start to finish. Staff our extremly pleasant and professional and nothing was a bother. Rooms are exceptional here, loads of room, luxurious and plush. Architecture of the hotel is very interesting, take time to look at the ceiling on the ground floor........

Would highly recommend a stay at The Marker (-:",5,2017,05,17
206,We REALLY Liked This Hotel,"This hotel was, top to bottom, a perfect execution of modern design.  Our room was beautiful, well equipped, and perfectly streamlined.  We truly appreciated the fact that all the closets, honor bar, etc. were well concealed behind sleek, modern panels. 

The sign of a great hotel is when you aren't sure that you ever left home, or wish you never had to leave!  Full marks at the Marker with its stylish lobby restaurants, subtle corridors, phenomenal staff, and Carrera marble bathroom.  Bonus points for the heated floor that makes every trip to the bathroom a pleasant treat.  Extra credit opportunity: add a heated towel rack.

The spa at this hotel was also quite impressive, though as always at this kind of hotel, quite booked for available appointments.  There is a lovely infinity pool, however, and large hot tub with strong jets, a steam and dry sauna, all in minimalist black tones and quiet environment.

The only reason this hotel didn't get a 5th star is due to the lack of a higher end restaurant.  The food offered was quite good, and room service top notch.  At the end of the day, however, all on offer after breakfast is basically bar food.  Dublin is far from being a 'foodie' destination, but I would expect a luxury accommodation like this to offer an oasis of quality food in this culinary desert of a city.  The rooftop bar offers great views, but I'd love to enjoy it with a great meal as well.

All told though, The Marker is an excellent choice for a visit to the Irish capital.  A short walk to the city center makes everything accessible, yet the Grand Canal location makes it less crowded and out of the way.  Of course, the concert venue next door probably makes for more convenience if you're visiting for a show.  For whatever your activity, sightseeing, concert, or just a relaxing hotel / spa visit, this hotel is highly recommended.",4,2017,05,16
206,Modern Hotel in a Vibrant Location,"Stayed here for two nights in a corner suite.
Great service throughout, excellent pool and gym, beautiful breakfasts.
Concierge service tops too! If you have a car - just use the valet valet service on offer.
On the downside, our room was advertised as having city and countryside views but it actually we only got to see the depressing and dark back end of a building.
Stefan and Gurpreet at checkout were quick to apologise and that was appreciated. I see the reference to the views has now been removed from the website. Fast work team :-). Pillows on the beds are really hard (as are the others in the wardrobe) but really that's not a biggie is it? No room is ever perfect.
This is a lovely hotel and I do recommend it.",4,2017,05,16
206,Wonderful 30th Birthday Stay,"I booked 2 nights at the Marker Hotel for my boyfriends 30th birthday celebrations. We had the most wonderful time. The staff are all so lovely and so helpful. The room was huge, with such a gorgeous bathroom. We spent a bit of time at the Spa on the Saturday, the hot tub is amazing! We also had some lovely cocktails on the rooftop bar, made all the more special with chocolate dipped strawberries as a surprise for my partners 30th. All in all, such a wonderful hotel, close to Dublin centre. Highly recommend! ",5,2017,05,16
206,perfect stay,"everything was perfect. Service was very kind, always there and up to date.. very good Location, quiet and everything was within walking distance. very good breakfast and excellent bar Service! Only negative: you can not open the window in the room.",5,2017,05,16
206,Perfect stay,"Great hotel, staff and location. Couldn't ask for a better stay. Rooftop bar is perfect on an evening with a great range of cocktails! Staff really tentative with recommendations for local and further area. Spa and pool are a wonderful luxury. Thank you Marker Hotel! ",5,2017,05,16
206,Excelent hotel,Great hotel with fantastic location and view. Rooms are super clean and comfortable. Really nice staff at the the entrance of the hotel and taking care of taxis for you. Great spa area. Good food although could have more vegan options,5,2017,05,15
206,Amazing hotel and really friendly staff...,"Stayed here for a night with the gf recently and we couldn't have been more impressed with everything from the greeting on entering to the bottles of water left inside our car for us as we drove off...

The hotel is located down by the docks and definitely is off the beaten track from the hustle and bustle of the city centre, in quite a business dominated area which is fairly quiet at the weekends. It is also directly across from the Bord Gais Energy Theater for those looking to attend.

As for the hotel itself; really nice on entering, very modern and spacious with smiley staff everywhere. Check in was a breeze and everyone from the manager to receptionist to the porter were really chatty.

The room is really nice. High ceilings, great views and very comfy beds. There was a nice note and chocolates left for us and the Nespresso machine was a great touch. Bathroom was amazing! Huge shower and nice bath. Heated floors as well.

The leisure area is quite simple really if using the general facilities. There's a decent sized pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi. Not much else. The reception area is great and again, staff very friendly. The showers in the changing rooms were superb.

There's a rooftop terrace bar which offers great views across the city serving really decent cocktails. 

This really is an absolutely fantastic hotel if you're looking to stay in the city centre! Drinks are great, location is good, rooms are amazing but it's both the staff and the many little touches you will experience while staying there that make it one of the best hotels in Dublin city. 

It's not cheap though, but then again a 5 star hotel in Dublin is never going to be...

Highly recommend.",5,2017,05,15
206,Modern marvel in the Docklands,"You know a neighborhood is transforming when it gets a swanky hotel like The Marker. A stone's throw from the offices of Google, Facebook, and AirBnB, this hotel is modern, comfortable, and will be our go-to place in Dublin. 

We had drinks and light snacks in the bar, and then breakfast in the restaurant the following morning. Both were stellar in service and quality. 

Our room was chic. The bed was comfortable, and, oh my, the bathroom was heaven. All white marble. But what stood out the most was how quiet our room was. We didn't hear one person rolling their suitcases down the hall and nothing from adjoining rooms. That gets top marks alone.",5,2017,05,14
206,Perfect stay,"Do not hesitate to book this hotel if you want to stay in a nice hotel, located in a quiet and modern area with very professionnal staff.The Brasserie proposes very good food at a decent rate.The Spa is also with nice and it's good to relax for a while after a day of viit.",5,2017,05,14
206,Great Hotel,"I've stayed at this property several times for work as it is very conveniently located near much of the new building that has happened within the city. This includes the property itself which is newer, designed to be very modern, and presents a great a value. The rooms here are large with many thoughtful touches, the breakfast in the restaurant is good, and the staff are very accommodating - both the desk as well as doormen. The only thing that regularly has vexed me is the key card/elevator thing - I can't explain but if you're an old guy like me this aspect may be too complicated and overthought but that's a small nit in the scheme of things. 

Overall this place is great and when I'm in Dublin I always check to see if there is availability at The Marker first.",5,2017,05,12
206,AC consistently does not work - beware when traveling during hot weather,"The AC did not work, which is not what we expected from a hotel of this caliber.

We called the front desk in the evening as the AC was not working. They told us they were controlling it from their central system and to wait 40 mins. After 40 mins, it still wasn't cool at all. They then sent someone up and gave us two fans to use, said they were 'amazing' and that they would cool down the room just as well in the next 30 mins.

We shouldn't have been so naive, as two fans certainly cannot be as effective as the broken AC unit. They did not offer to let us change rooms, and by the time we realized the fans would not do the trick, it was close to 11 pm.

We spoke to the front desk in the morning and they told us they would send a maintenance worker there to fix it. That said, I have searched in the reviews for this hotel and the AC appears to be consistently an issue. I am not sure I believe in the 'we have repaired this so it does not affect future guests' argument. For a hotel of this price range, I do not expect to have two small fans try to supplement with an AC unit should do in hot temperatures.

My friend could not sleep for half the night because of the heat. When she brought this up with the front desk staff, the staff asked: ""But you eventually were able to fall asleep?"" Not helpful....

I've emailed the hotel's guest relations manager but she hasn't responded to my complaint. It was a shame since we did enjoy the people we met at this hotel otherwise.",2,2017,05,11
206,Highlight,"The Marker is a stand out hotel set right on the new Dockland of Dublin. Beautifully designed, the restaurants and bars are full of both the locals as well as the guests. The rooms are minimalist and a pleasure to stay in. The bathroom is divine with an underfloor capable of burning your feet if you were silly enough to turn it to high. The swimming pool and sauna facilities are to be experienced as well. Definitely my hotel of choice from now on when in Dublin. One tip is ask for a room on the dockside unless you don't want to look at the water and those enjoying it.",4,2017,05,11
206,Exceptional Service,"Only stayed one night here on business but the stay was top-notch. What really set the hotel apart was the great service, from booking to departure. The reception staff in particular went out of their way to be helpful. Also I hadn't realised just how close it was to the centre of things: just a 10 minute walk to Trinity College. Would definitely stay again (will try out the rooftop bar next time). Room tip: ask for a room overlooking the canal. ",5,2017,05,10
206,The best hotel ever,"

Everything worked - everyone was extremely friendly and accommodating. I have tried many nice hotels, but this is the best of them all - and I've lived in many many hotels around the world. The hotel is an experience in itself.
",5,2017,05,10
206,Excellent in every way,"As an ex-Dublin resident, the Marker is the only place I ever want to stay on returning to Dublin. It deserves its 5-star rating - apart from the excellent facilities and amazingly comfortable rooms and beds, the staff go over and above to make you feel welcome and attended to during your stay. The bar is a great place for a drink, the restaurant and room service food are top class, and the gym and pool facilities very good.",5,2017,05,10
206,Dublin vacation ,"The Marker Hotel was amazing!   Everything was perfect, from our room to the rooftop bar to the employees at the hotel.  This hotel ranks in my of my top 5 best hotels ever!  The service and people that work there are the best I have seen.  It's about a 15 min walk to the Temple Bar or Trinity college area but it's an easy walk and you are away from the noise of those areas.   Strongly recommend this hotel if your looking for a place in Dublin that treats you right.  ",5,2017,05,09
206,Beautiful hotel with awesome amenities,"Loved everything about this hotel. The staff were friendly and accommodating, our room was swanky and clean, the bathroom was fit for a queen! The amenities (pool, locker room, steam room) were the perfect way to relax and recharge. Loved everything about this place! ",5,2017,05,09
206,Fabulous stay.,"Fabulous hotel with perfect service, wonderful view on the docks from the room and perfect rooftop bar to watch the sunset and enjoy a delicious drink.
Professional staff and very helpful.
Quiet, very clean and spacious room.
Great swimming pool.
Delicious dinner with the best beef and wine we have had in a long time.
Thank you.",5,2017,05,09
206,"Very nice rooms, great staff, good location for visiting Google, Facebook and other offices","One of the best business hotels anywhere in Europe, and definitely the best in Dublin. I travel a lot and rarely look forward to staying at any hotel, but the Marker is an exception. The staff are lovely, the rooms very modern, luxurious, super clean, and very quiet.",5,2017,05,09
206,Beautiful hotel will be back,"A very classy hotel, great location and very helpful staff. We were very pleased with our visit and requests that were made were provided. Concierge were excellent and the waiting staff were extremely helpful and pleasant.",4,2017,05,09
206,1 fabulous night in The Marker,"Generally, I wouldn't take the time to review the hotels that I stay in, however The Marker is absolutely exceptional. We are from Dublin but decided to take an overnight break to celebrate our Anniversary. From the moment we arrived the attention to detail was on a level that is seldom experienced. The service, the Spa, the room, the bar and restaurant are all faultless!  I would recommend this hotel without hesitation to anyone staying in Dublin and wants a very memorable experience!",5,2017,05,09
206,"Stylish, but avoid if you like natural light & good service - try the Spencer or Gibson instead","I was looking forward to staying at the Marker, with it coming highly recommended by my colleagues.  It's well located for the Dublin Tech / Financial centres, and pricier than the other local hotels.  I was expecting a superior experience, but was very disappointed - in my view, both the Spencer & Gibson offer an equivalent modern, stylish room experience, with better service, at a lower price.

Two specific challenges undermined my stay at the Marker:
- Lighting.  As you can see in the main picture of the hotel exterior, there are many neon lights on the outside of the building.  If you're happy to sleep with blackout blinds close, this is fine - because sleeping with blackout blinds is the only choice if you actually want to get to sleep.  Personally, I like to sleep allowing for some natural light in the morning to come through - but leaving the blackout blind open meant the room felt like a bright nightclub, with neon light flooding in from outside.  To frame this - it is much worse than 'normal' street lighting or reasonable city evening light pollution- it is a bright light mounted almost directly outside many of the 6th floor windows, and remained on all night.

- Check-in experience / Service: After I arrived in my room, having handed over my credit card at check in, I was called and asked to return to reception who had failed to take a PIN from me.  By the time I received the call, it was 9:30pm; I answered the phone from the bathroom at the end of a long day and explained that I wouldn't be retuning to check-in; it was their mistake and if they needed me in person, they needed to come up to my room.  I understand that people make errors, however the expectations that I would get fully dressed again to come and rectify their error, when they already had card details on file, were not reasonable or in any way necessary.

- The room itself was stylish and had nice toiletries, but there are equally stylish and more reasonably priced hotels in the area that don't have these challenges; I won't be returning.
",2,2017,05,09
206,"Clean, Friendly, Classy, Attentive. Location Not Central","Having traveled to four other countries before coming to Dublin, we had already seen four hotels in the prior 9 days. Arriving at the Marker, it definitely has some aesthetic appeal and looks like a 5-star hotel. Probably the only negative we had with the stay was that upon arrival, the taxi driver had to help us unload our four suitcases, while two employees stood at the door talking, and did not offer to help until we had wheeled them almost to the door. 

The check-in process was easy and we were upgraded without request to a nice spacious room. The color scheme of the room is interesting with royal blue carpet, but the amenities were top notch and the bed was comfortable. We enjoyed the Nespresso machine, heated bathroom floors, and floor to ceiling windows. 

The front desk helped us multiple times with research on restaurants and even gave me a few bottles of water for free when I needed it after the closest two markets were closed. 

While we would definitely stay here again based on the overall quality and service of the hotel, we felt that for vacation, this hotel is not located in the best area. It is right next to Facebook and several other prominent companies, a theater, and  The Ferryman (great pour of Guinness), etc, but you pretty much need to taxi everywhere, unless you really like walking.",5,2017,05,08
206,5 star wow! A fantastic hotel,"My wife and I stayed in the Marker last weekend for our anniversary. On arrival a valet took my car and another assisted with cases. Very fast and easy check-in. All amenities explained. The room was lovely. Bright and airy with excellent air conditioning. Krupps coffee machine, treats and a fridge. Huge marble bathroom with bath and shower. Very comfortable king bed. The hotel is surrounded by a Quay and is very quiet. About a mile to Grafton Street but a straight walk. Absolutely fantastic and huge breakfast buffet of both hot and cold food. Plenty of juice, tea and coffees. Every member of staff went out for their way to either smile or have a few words of acknowledgement. Evening turn down service and chocolates. When I'm back in Dublin I will be heading straight to the marker hotel. ",5,2017,05,08
206,"Excellent customer service , the room and bathroom were both amazing. Loved the heated floors","We loved the marker hotel, room was amazing.

206,"If sick on a business trip, you want to be here!!","Amazing team, my colleague was sick and they couldn't have been more accommodating and supportive. Little touches like send up tea and honey, calls to check how they are feeling. I would recommend this hotel to anyone! Facilities are amazing as well but none of that matters when you are ill, it's the people that make this place perfect! ",5,2017,05,08
206,Cool and very happy staff with good amenities,"The place is very good in a very accesible location. The hotel staff is very nice and friendly any help can be done with a touch of smile.

206,Amazing!!!!,"Fantastic hotel! Friendly helpful staff. Clean, well equipped rooms. Great for a short break. I recommend you pre book spa treatment though as they get full very quickly.  It was a little out of the way of the main town but it this was quite refreshing!",5,2017,05,06
206,Great service at a wonderful hotel,"Top hotel with wonderful commitment to service from nearly all staff. Very good. A bit of a way out of city centre but an easy walk. Modern, clean, not the cheapest, but ideal if you want to pamper yourself ",5,2017,05,06
206,"Trendy, hip, contemporary hotel","We stayed for 3 nights in the Marker and had a most enjoyable experience.   From the doorman,  to the front desk staff to the servers at the restaurant and housekeeping,  EVERYONE was extremely helpful and pleasant.   After a day the staff referred to us by name.   It is in a delightful and attractive area of Dublin near the quay and the new office buildings of Facebook and Google but it is a healthy 10-15 minute walk to the sights of Dublin.  Room was perfect.    Highly recommend the Marker!",5,2017,05,06
206,Great Location and experience,"Excellent hotel for business or pleasure. Modern larger rooms are well appointed. Bathroom and showers and large, and heated floors are wonderful !

The attention to detail. The pillow menu is such a fabulous touch. I ordered a feather down pillow and I had the best night sleep. 
I had possibly the best spa treatment with Magdalena. Highly recommend her.

206,Great hotel at the heart of Dublin city,"My wife and I stayed here courtesy of my family and a very generous birthday present. We had a wonderful time in the hotel. All staff were friendly and helpful without in any way coming across as overbearing. Good eye contact, good conversational skills. Whatever training programme the staff undergo is really working. 

Our room was bright and comfortable yet also secluded. They have a small subset of international sockets set into the bedroom desk.  The shower gels are presented as very aromatic and may seem strange on first reading, but they really work! 

We had dinner in the bar, which was kicked off with some incredible cocktails. If you are attending a show in the Bord G√°is theatre you should book a table for no later than 5.30. 

The breakfast at the Marker is a great experience. You are shown to your table, you can begin to eat from the buffet, and then you are asked for your room. It all is reflective of an approach to customer service that seeks to make your experience as smooth and comfortable as possible. There is a great selection of cereals, hot food for a fry, berries and nuts for porridge and a good menu of hot food to order from. When our car was dropped back from the valet car park, there were two bottles of still water in the car - a simple but nice touch. We will be back! 

The only possible improvement I would recommend would be to give some more info on the website as to the custom and practice of the gym and spa. No hotel does this well really, but it would be great if the website said how the lockers work, towels, water available in the gym etc. ",5,2017,04,30

206,A gem of a hotel,"we typically stay in the city center - around Grafton St - but on this occasion wanted to be near the Bord Gais Theatre. We LOVED this hotel. The staff is among the best trained pleasant and happy people we have ever encountered. We can be 'needy' guests at times, especially when we are working, and nothing was too much to ask of the staff at this hotel. The food, the beverages, the room service, the bedroom, linens, towels, peace and quiet and a fun location. We will be back!!! Soon!!!",5,2017,04,30

206,Great Spot,"Fab hotel, would recommend upgrading to the duluxe room for a more spacious room and a nice view. Bar was comfortable, friendly and cocktails are amazing - best in Dublin. I was disappointed that the roof terrace wasn't open on the night we stayed as it was one of items that drew me to this hotel. Beds were very comfortable, it was probably the most comfy bed of all the hotels I stayed in Dublin ",5,2017,04,27
206,Excellent Marker Hotel,"Weekend break in The Marker Hotel, this is my favourite Hotel in Dublin by a mile, 5 star customer service, accommodation, food, drink & location particularly if going to the Bord Gais. Would strongly recommend !  ",5,2017,04,26
206,"Will not return ,decent but so airless","I liked the quality of the hotel , I liked the location and the staff were attentive  and pleasant ( if a little Eastern European and so not that easy to understand ) But the public areas were so hot and airless they were unbearable the room was a little better but you could not open the window - it was only April so that would have sorted it. There was air con but it was pathetic and only just stopped me having to check out . The Breakfast is a ridiculous price (e28) on top of a e250 room and e24 daily parking fee - although you don't have to buy the breakfast -it looked ordinary - as there is a Caf√© next do that does a decent one for a e10",3,2017,04,26

206,The Marker Hits the The Mark for Young Folks,"We stayed one night at The Marker. The staff were very friendly and helpful. It has a good location down by the docks and The Harp Bridge. Excellent breakfast. We loved the heated floor in the bathroom, which was very large. The only drawback for us was the black and white color scheme.  It makes for dark hallways and dark floors in the room. ",4,2017,04,25
206,Excellent,"Beautiful hotel, attention to detail of all staff is second to none. Food was top class in both the resturant and at the roof top bar. 
Would highly recommend this hotel and will be back in the near future. ",5,2017,04,25

206,Marker in April,"Well appointed hotel, however overpriced particularly comparing corner suite to regular rooms. Several choices on menu were not available at a 9:00pm seatingbon a Saturday night. Choice of starters very poor though main course and dessert very good. There was a welcoming dessert platter on arrival. However same platter was still there two days later. Quite off putting to say the least.   There was an adjacent room totally devoid of furniture and just a waste of space. Clearly not a suite as only had bedroom with a work desk. Poor description. ",4,2017,04,25
206,Great calming pool and sauna,"Very convenient for the convention centre. A half hour stroll along the river from all of the main restaurants, bars and shops. Lovely rooftop bar. Great staff and service. Lovely Guinness and excellent breakfast. ",5,2017,04,25
206,TOP Notch,"Simply perfect in every way. From the service, to the food, to the rooms, to the spa - just superb in every way. The staff also made you feel personally welcome, which is a real skill. Stop looking at other hotels and book immediately!!",5,2017,04,24

206,The Marker Dublin,"Had such an enjoyable stay at teh Marker last Friday night, everything from arrival to departure was so well organised and managed.. I could feel the stress draining away. We had a lovely spacious room , an impressive bathroom with lots of fab toiletries. there was a warm welcome in the form of sweet treats to accompany the Nespresso coffee - standard in all rooms. The food at dinner was gorgeous. We went to the restaurant for breakfast and despite being a late arrival ( 10.30 for 11am finish), all the warm dishes were freshly replensihed. Service was great at every point. A super nice touch when the valet brought our car around was 2 bottles of mineral water left in the car for our onward journey. Love this hotel and it was a joy to be a guest. ",5,2017,04,24
206,BUSINESS TRIP,"I stayed in the hotel one night.
The personel is very gentle and charm.
The hotel is not in the centre but in a very peaceful zone for walking.
Good drinks and cocktail in the bar and excellent rooms
It has a rooftop but it was closed during my stay.

206,"Great hotel, great service","I spent 4 nights at The Marker and the service was impeccable. The room was flawless and the personal very professional.
Location-wise, it is about 20 minutes walk from the city center. 
Price is on the high-end.",5,2017,04,23
206,Wonderful hotel.,"My wife, 2 young children (12 and 10) and myself recently stayed at the Marker hotel for family vacation.  The facilities, room, and extras were top notch.  We chose this place since is was one of few places that offers a suite to fit the four of us.  Otherwise would need to get 2 rooms at most other places.  The suite was just a bigger studio type room, the kids slept on a pull out sofa bed in the same room, there was not a separate room in the suite.  But beautiful overall and we had a great view of the main plaza.  The breakfast was included and the buffet breakfast was top notch.  Warm foods, not just fruits, cereals and breads.  

There was a nice perk however. Since we had a few day tours planned that left quite early in the morning, we were going to miss out on the breakfast.  We asked the staff for help and they were able to arrange for to-go breakfasts that we could eat on the bus.  Again, something you may not get at other hotels. No extra charge too.

The location was not that central, away from the hub of restaurants and bar scene in central Dublin. Walking with smaller kids, took 20-25 minutes.  Cab was about 10 euro to central Dublin. 3 euro alone was tacked on for having 4 people in cab.  

The time restriction for the kids partaking in the pool was also a down side.  Only 3-5pm daily which made it tough when that's prime sightseeing times.  Dublin is a city that does not have a lot of attractions for kids, so sometimes pool time to make their trip more enjoyable is key.

We had dinner in their restaurant one evening and had room service another night.  Both excellent as well.   

Overall I highly recommend this hotel.  You pay a little bit more but you get excellent service, accommodations and food. Special thanks to both Kasia and Nicole, they were quite helpful  and went above and beyond to try to make our experience pleasurable and hasslefree.",5,2017,04,23
206,Excellent Hotel - staff very friendly and helpful.,"My Husband and I had a great time staying at The Marker, loved the experience and loved Dublin.
Barry - the Concierge, really great guy and his local knowledge was most helpful - had a laugh or two also.
All the staff, first class.",5,2017,04,23
206,Wonderfull City Hotel,"We last stayed here in January 2016. It remains a proper five star hotel by any standards around Europe and beyond. The breakfast offering, room service and bar lunches were top notch. The breakfast is a bit special with a wide choice of buffet style dishes ( including solid honeycomb ) and specials of well garnished pancakes and French toast. We choose a corner room (525) with views over the playground the old chimney and modern buildings across the Liffey. euro 11 for a taxi to St Stephens Green so it is quite central. On the recommendation of an interesting retired Garda taxi driver we visited the Diving Bell attraction five minutes walk from The Marker. Really worth a visit. Finally the professionalism of Housekeeping staff is always a good sign for a well run hotel.",5,2017,04,22

206,Mid- week break,"Lovely hotel, friendly and helpful,  great location, spa facilities excellent with a great pool. I would recommend again to friends and family who were thinking of an inner Dublin hotel. Also given good directions on where to visit in Dublin. ",5,2017,04,22
206,Dublin Training,Stay was for 3 days. It was the Accenture training. Will be good to increase the meal options. The personalized TV welcome was very good. I stayed in Clayton and the breakfast options were better there.   ,4,2017,04,22
206,Amazing as always,"Perfection from start to finish, everything you'd expect from a 5* and more. Rooms are beautiful and how they are so quiet in the middle of a bustling city is beyond me. Service, breakfast everything top notch. ",5,2017,04,22
206,Charming place,"Stayed for a romantic weekend, great way to discover Dublin, we enjoyed the spa and swimming pool a lot. Staff was very helpful giving us advice for our trip in the city.
Will come back eventually to enjoy the rooftop (closed during our stay)",4,2017,04,22
206,A truly excellent hotel,"Great location obviously....and the rooftop bar deserves its praise. The staff everywhere are lovely. My clients are very pleased with the rooms, facilities & spa.
Our meal this evening was delicious and all managed in the midst of the VIP Awards. Kudos.",5,2017,04,21
206,Left phone in taxi - No problem to The Marker!,"This hotel progressively continues to impress with their world class standards. I got engaged here around 18 months ago and have stayed 3 times. On this occasion I wasn't staying in the hotel, and on the way to a football game I left my phone charging in a taxi and was on my own. I went to the nearby guarda station when I immediately realised. They were very offensive in mannerism and I was on my own in the city. 

I booked a different taxi to the Marker and gave them the phone number. They led me to a seat, served me a top class cocktail and 45 minutes later they handed me my phone after countless efforts to call it. (Very useful when alone in the city)

With continued service of this Calibre they will certainly take the number 1 spot on trip advisor. ",5,2017,04,21
206,Second time is a charm,"This was my second time staying at the Marker, and I'd do it again in a heart beat. From the moment one walks in, the service is top notch. The staff is professional, classy, and super friendly. They pay attention to every little detail and remember you when you return hours later. My friend and I stayed in a superior twin room, and aside from very comfortable beds and pillows, some of the room's features are as follows:  complete mini bar with a brand new Nespresso machine (this was a huge highlight for me!). Coffee pods are replenished everyday. Other perks include the cable television, heated bathroom floors, toiletries by Malin and Goetz, quiet hallways, and excellent room service (with the beautiful touch of a fresh orchid each time one orders).   You should know the area is a bit far from the city center, but it's a 15 minute walk or a few minutes taxi ride. There are other restaurants around the hotel, but they close early. If you want class, comfort, and beauty, this is the hotel for you. ",5,2017,04,21
206,Amazing stay at an amazing hotel,"The Marker Hotel has it all, the hotel is amazing, the staff are a credit to the hotel, the spa is so relaxing, I will definitely be back worth every penny next time with my partner.
Thank you Tara Baile√© & Callum",5,2017,04,21
206,Great hotell and friendly people,I had 3 great days as Marker Hotell. The rooms were big and comportable with a very nice bathroom. The employees were friendly and helpful. It was a relaxing athmosphere at the hotell and I enjoyed staying there. It took about 12-15 minutes walk to the Central Dublin. ,5,2017,04,21
206,Amazing place to stay,"The perfect place to stay in Dublin if you are after pure luxury. 
The staff are very helpful and knowledgeable of Dublin as a whole. 
The Bar and Brasserie produce amazing food and the breakfast are one of the best I have had at a hotel stay. ",5,2017,04,21
206,First class Hotel,A very comfortable stay.  Staff are all very friendly and welcoming.  The public areas are clean lines and very contemporary.  The suites are of a very good size with all the first class amenities you would expect in a luxury hotel.,5,2017,04,21
206,Excelant for our age group,"Need to understand the area of the Hotel in regards to city center of Dublin before booking. To us this is important as we had to walk and taxi quite a bit, this was due to us booking a top hotel and forgetting about the area. Cost of breakfast should be reviewed, can be purchased for 1/3 few doors away.",5,2017,04,20
206,Weekend Break,Lovely Hotel in docklands. Shame about surrounding areas but Hotel cannot do anything about that. Did not feel particularly safe walking at night. Idealy situated for the theatre. All Hotel staff helpful and polite,5,2017,04,20
206,Perfect stay,"My first time at The Marker Hotel.
Nice room with nearly perfect facilities. Little example, on TV should be a german News channel. 
Great service from staff. Very friendly and helpful. 
Especially the team in the spa.

206,Excellent Hotel,"Enjoyable Easter break at The Marker Hotel.

High level of service and excellent amenities such as rooftop bar and spa. Enjoyable atmosphere, high end service without feeling too 'snobby.'

206,Long Weekend at the Marker,"It is not too often that you stay in a hotel that leaves such a positive impression on you well this is one of the very few! From the front door and throughout I have never met a group so totally concerned that guests should have all that they need in a timely,genuine and friendly fashion! From Stefan in guest relations whose restaurant and tour recommendations were superb,Liam hotel manager and Leon,Barry, Alex and Zoltan who just went over and above to insure we had the best stay. Others take note..this is customer service at it's very best! We hope to return soon..Thanks to you all Dublin was a blast!",5,2017,04,19
206,Sophistication in Dublin's Docklands,"The Marker is situated in a lovely location in the middle of the canal square which is buzzing with life. It is a flat one mile walk along the River Liffey into Dublin. Decorated to a very high standard it has tasteful furniture and fittings. Our room had all the facilities we needed and was an excellent size. All staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The food in the brassiere was excellent and well presented.
The evening menu was comprehensive and an amazing range of healthy options were available for breakfast.Highly recommended!",5,2017,04,19
206,"Great food, lovely staff","The hotel is on Canal Square in the heart of Dublin's docklands development. It's near the bars and restaurants of the square and a flat 1 mile walk along the river Liffey to the city centre. 

The service is 5 star and friendly with great front of house and restaurant staff. The food is innovative and well prepared, heading towards a few awards.  Well done the Marker team. ",5,2017,04,19
206,Easter Break,Girls Easter weekend break - this hotel was recommended by a friend and we weren't disappointed. Lovely hotel with wonderful staff. Rooms spotless and breakfast was lovely - we didn't have dinner in restaurant but menu looked very tasty. Location close to city centre. ,5,2017,04,18
206,"Incredible service, very warm and welcoming","This hotel could not have been a better experience - the staff was incredibly warm and welcoming, and the attention to detail was impeccable. Oftentimes at a hotel with service in this category, you may almost felt out of place or it can feel snobby, but this experience felt accessible and very welcoming. The room was so clean and comfortable, and the marble bathroom was exquisite. The steam room and sauna were an amazing perk (we went all three days of our stay!), and the rooftop bar was great too. The whole stay really couldn't have been better, and the staff were of the highest quality. Highly recommend.",5,2017,04,18
206,The Marker Hotel Experience,"First time in Dublin... arrived around 8am and super tired after 20hrs of flying and the shift from 40 to 4 degrees (OMG!)... 

My friends and I were welcomed by the staff of The Marker hotel. Our rooms were not available yet since check-in time is 3pm but the staff were so kind to offer us free breakfast and use of the spa so we can freshen up. 

Fast forward to 3pm that day, after walking around the area we finally checked-in. The wait was worth it. The room was perfect... comfy bed, clean bathroom, cable tv, wifi, etc. 

The rest of the stay was great. Staff is always so kind and accommodating. Breakfast is free flowing (although I wish there is variety). We had cocktails in the rooftop which has a perfect view of the docklands. 

Overall I had the best time! Will definitely go back to The Marker if given the chance to visit Dublin again. ",5,2017,04,18
206,Top Quality Hotal,"Stayed here for only 1 night while attending a concert in the 3 arena. This is a case where you definitely get what you pay for! While the hotel isn't cheap, there is a reason for that. The rooms are excellent, modern and very comfortable. We had breakfast included in the room. At ‚Ç¨24 per person this would be overpriced if you were to pay for it separately. The breakfast is only standard I would say but very nice all the same. We didn't eat in the bar or restaurant but they both looked good. The location is very good for the 3 arena or theater but slightly far from the shopping areas (you would need a taxi). Used the spa on a previous visit and it was also excellent. Good TV package in the room. Overall this is a top quality hotel with a very high quality and I would strongly recommend it. If you can get a deal all the better!",5,2017,04,18
206,Dockside Hotel,"Great hotel and beautiful views from the rooftop bar. Cocktails were a tad expensive for what they were but that seems to be a Dublin thing rather than specific to the hotel. 

Staff were friendly, attentive and knowledgeable.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Thanks to all who made our stay so enjoyable.",5,2017,04,18
206,Marker Hotel,"Best hotel in Dublin. Their cordial is a bit pricey, but everything else is top notch. Would stay here again. Best Rooftop bar in Dublin & best Spa in the country!! Five star service from a Five star hotel!",5,2017,04,18
206,A Lovely Getaway to Dublin,"The Marker Hotel was great! By booking through their website, we got complimentary breakfast (which was very convenient and delicious). It was an easy walk to the center of town, a bit more of a walk to the Kilmainhaim Gaol / Guinness Factory area, but very easy to get cabs / ubers if long walks aren't your thing. ",5,2017,04,18
206,Hits all the right marks,"We stayed at the Marker during the Easter weekend and found it to be a delightful experience. The hotel is located in a very contemporary part of Dublin, check-in was warm and efficient and our room was spotless.  Dinner at the brasserie was very good in terms of service and food selection and the maitre'd's sense of humour which came through during the conversation was a bonus. But the showstopper at this hotel is really the warmth of the staff and the care/consideration they display for their work - from the doorman who never fails to greet you 'good morning' or 'welcome back' to the housekeeper who ensured that our toiletries had a small towel to rest on - these small touches and attention to detail made it not just professional, but personal. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,04,17
206,Marker,We had a fleeting visit on the last night of our honeymoon. The staff made us feel very welcome and the room itself was great. We felt the price was a little steep as it did not include breakfast but we chose this hotel as we had to leave very early intervention the morning anyway.,5,2017,04,17
206,Beautiful hotel,The Marker Hotel is beautiful and in a lovely location on the docklands. The rooms are quiet and exceptionally clean. It is only 10 minutes to the main part of Dublin and you get to return to a lovely peaceful environment after a night out. ,5,2017,04,17
206,A birthday weekend to remember,"Fabulous hotel, staff were so helpful and polite. Gorgeous rooms loved the underground heating in the bathroom. Loads of little touches that make it 5 star. Definitely the nicest breakfast I've ever had from the home made Granola to the French toast I'm hungry just thinking about it & so many helpful obliging staff makes it all so easy. I will definitely be back. ",5,2017,04,16
206,Best hotel experience hands down,This was by far one of the best conferences and in large part due to the service and facilities of this hotel.  I would definitely consider the Marker Hotel for any business or pleasure trip in the future! ,5,2017,04,16
206,Not 5 star quality,"There was a mistake made with the room with forgetting to do the romance package which ruined the stay for us, having to wait awkwardly for an hour why they re did it and then to put the wrong name on the card was careless of them and ruined the stay for us that the duty of care was not there. Would not recommend couples to stay.",1,2017,04,16
206,Great place to stay in Dublin,"Had the joy of stay at The Marker Hotel, it was great experience staff was friendly and helpful., rooms are clean spacious and well kept, great view of waterfront, very easy to access from the airport, close to important landmarks. Overall a very good choice.",5,2017,04,15

206,Great service,I really liked the hotel. Everyone was very polite and obliging. The SPA is gorgeous and the Whiskey Sour is definitely on my top 5 list. Besides Dublin is worth a trip and the location is very central!,5,2017,04,14
206,Great weekend stay in Dublin,My overall experience at the Marker Hotel was excellent. My husband recently stayed here from a Thursday night to a Monday morning. The entire hotel staff was very friendly and helpful based on our encounters. The concierge and front desk especially  did a superb job helping us out when we needed reservations for dinner and arrangements for taxi services. I very much enjoyed the modern vibe of the hotel and the luxurious accommodations.,5,2017,04,13
206,Very good hotel conveniently located for business,"The Marker Hotel is a modern and fully equipped hotel near many of the high tech locations that have situated themselves in the Docklands area of Dublin.  The physical environment of the hotel is first rate extending to the lobby, common areas, bar, restaurant and rooms.  My room was large looking out on to a central courtyard.  The bathroom was oversize with a tub, shower enclosure and heated floor.  One minor point was my difficulty in adjusting the shower water temperature.  The staff were all most helpful and knowledgeable.  I stayed for three nights and my room was kept in pristine condition.  I would have rated the Marker with a top rating except for one annoyance.  The hotel seems to be a center for Accenture management training and their attendees acted as if they owned the building.  On several occasions their employees, which I knew from their badges, pushed in front of me at the front desk and elsewhere, showing no respect for proper behavior.",4,2017,04,12
206,Nice stay in Dublin,"
I went for a week as part of an International Summit conducted at the hotel. It would had been excellent stay but the room did not have a view to the city just to a wall that made it less attractive. This is a world class hotel and my wife and really had a great experience stay in it.
",4,2017,04,12
206,Short stay,"Overnight trip - great room, expensive, staff brusque- no interaction when extra information given about nature of trip / inappropriate attempt to upsell us on the spa even though we were departing before it opened! ",3,2017,04,12

206,Beautiful Hotel. Very friendly staff,"From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very welcome.
Our room was beautiful and very quiet.
The food was excellent 
The friendliness and helpfulness of all of the staff was exceptional.
We went to a show in the Bord Gais Energy Theatre and the hotel is ideally situated as close as you would need to the theatre. The hotel offers a pre show dinner menu which starts from 5pm and is reasonably priced.
Overall we had a very enjoyable stay",5,2017,04,11
206,Service at its best,To put it succinctly BRILLIANT BRILLIANT BRILLIANT. It's a long time since I have encountered such a high level of personal and professional service from a staff who are willing to put the needs of the customer first. It is so old fashioned but they almost anticipated you requirement before you spoke it. Cannot praise the staff highly enough and it is they who make The Marker a wonderful experience.  ,5,2017,04,11
206,"Fabulous Hotel, Great Service","The kerbside greeting as we got out of the car set the bar fairly high for our recent Saturday night stay at the Marker. I'm happy to say the rest of our stay didn't disappoint.  The staff were superb from start to finish. Excellent service throughout the hotel without being overbearing.

The room was modern, clean, spacious and comfortable with a large bathroom for a city-centre hotel.

Located in a prime spot opposite the Bord Gais Theatre, the Marker is in the ideal location for anyone taking in a show.

The hotel bar is perfect for a few post-show drinks, a pleasant buzz of activity without being overcrowded.

Breakfast offered a great selection of high-quality hot and cold produce, the only slight let-down being the barely tepid 'hot' items.

We would definitely recommend this hotel and look forward to out next visit.

TIP: If you're thinking of staying at the Marker, be sure to check the prices on the hotels own website.  You may find the prices 1 or 2 euro per-night higher than some of the hotel booking websites but direct bookings are eligible for a free room upgrade and access to the hotel spa.

206,Rooftop Area is amazing (APPARENTLY!),"We were not permitted to even view the rooftop bar area. And on Sunday it was ""closed"" Very disappointing as main reason we as a group of friends decided to stay at Marker. In fact we found it difficult to even try and request a table for pre dinner drinks downstairs even though we were all guests. ",4,2017,04,11
206,Superb service and staff,"Can't fault any aspect of our stay. A very personal welcome from the reception staff to great waiters and bar staff. He room was modern, extremely clean and wonderfully comfortable. Fantastic experience, this hotel has got it right. ",5,2017,04,11
206,Excellent Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and it was really impressive.  I didn't get a chance to use any of the amenities, but did use the concierge and ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant.  Overall the service was excellent.  There was always someone offering to help you.  The breakfast at the restaurant was superb... I ordered the eggs Benedict and it was the best I have ever had. 

The only downside of the entire trip was that I received a room with absolutely no view or light.  My room looked into other offices and was very dark.  I wish I'd specifically asked for a room with a view of the dock.",4,2017,04,10
206,Very classy & wonderful view,"We went here with a large family group for confirmation lunch. It was very spacious, lovely colourful and comfortable furniture & nice food. We went up to the top floor outside & got a great view of Dublin. The only thing that wasn't quite right was too much salt in some meals, cod & spring salad. The people working there are top class on service :-) ",4,2017,04,10
206,6 Star Service!,"The most amazing stay, in the most beautiful hotel.  Staff cant do enough for you.  We were treated like absolute Queens.  We had a lovely relaxing overnight break, just wish we had of stayed two nights now! Cant wait to go back!",5,2017,04,10

206,Amazing!,The best hotel we stayed in during our entire trip to Ireland.  If you are staying in Dublin I highly recommend the Marker hotel.  First Class all the way.  Heated tile floor in the bathroom was awesome. ,5,2017,04,09
206,Top Class Hotel in Dublin,"I stayed at the Marker Hotel while on business in the vicinity of the hotel which was a bonus.
The hotel itself is wonderful with a good, modern, clean look and feel and the staff are very professional, courteous and helpful.  Service was top notch.
The room has really nice amenities required, free wifi and even provides a variety of international power outlets which is a nice touch (even though one of them wasn't working).
The pool is fantastic and in a nice relaxing area.
The food is fantastic and the bar relaxing and service top notch.
Only disappointment was the rooftop bar was closed so could not be experienced.

206,Dublin location,"An amazing staff, relaxing rooms and perfect location. Look forward to returning! Was here on business but would come back for vacation and enjoy the spa facilities and rooftop next time.
always had someone engaging in the lobby and a great place to enjoy the lobby and people watch with coffee or cocktails.",5,2017,04,07

206,Superb Hotel,"Stayed here for a long weekend - wish we could have stayed longer - everything was simply perfect - gorgeous room on the 6th floor overlooking the docks, fantastic pool, sauna and spa facilities - great location within easy walking distance of the centre or near to tram and bus stops - attentive, helpful staff - we loved our stay and would highly recommend this hotel - for us there is no better hotel in Dublin.",5,2017,04,07
206,Fantastic Find,"The Marker is a wonderful hotel in a unique neighborhood of Dublin. Huge rooms, huge bathrooms, attentive staff. Great value for your money.  Our recent stay was a great experience. Be sure to see Rachel in the bar for friendly service!",5,2017,04,07
206,Absolutely Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed at The Marker, although a little pricey, for a family weekend.  When we arrived the service could not have been better.  We drove from Athlone so parked the car in the set down area.  Vladimar came straight to us and offered us valet parking.  In comparison to public parking, it was ‚Ç¨6 cheaper per day as we were staying there.  Great service.  Vladimar also brought up a trolley for our cases and directed us to the check in desk.  We were checked in very speedily and told everything we needed to know about the hotel.  We were then taken up to our rooms - all close together on the 3rd floor.  When we went in Vladimar told us how everything worked (including the underfloor heating) and showed us where the hidden kettle etc were.  Our room was amazing.  Really large and our bed was huge.  The bathroom was marble and massive with the most fantastic shower I have ever used.  Lovely white fluffy towels and a great view.
The Marker is right on the water front so very accessible to the bars across the bridge.
The breakfast was probably one of the best I have ever eaten with everything you could possibly want including a real honeycomb.  They have literally thought of everything and if it wasn't there, for example baked beans and omelette, then they would produce it for you, with only a few minutes wait whilst it was freshly cooked.
I actually cannot say enough great things about this fantastic hotel and will definitely be staying there again.

Absolutely Very Highly recommended

206,Lovely Hotel and Great Staff,"We stayed there for a night and were greeted by lovely staff. We heard great things about their doughnuts and had paid in advance to get them up to the room which got mixed up but we ended up getting some of them once we were checking out. 
I think the best part of the hotel were the toiletries, which are absolutely amazing (MALIN + GOETZ).
The rooftop bar has some great views but has a long queue just to get up to the top. The prices, as expected were high and the wind was chilly but everyone was supplied with blankets which made it all that more bearable.",5,2017,04,07
206,Perfect staff. ,"With my sisters and Mum, I stayed in the Marker on Saturday evening after enjoying Blood Brothers in the theatre (literally a stones throw away!). We arrived way earlier than check in time, but were fortunate to be able to check in straight away. 

The rooms are stunning and exceptionally clean and well-maintained. This was my second time here and I was just as impressed by the luxury the rooms offer. 

We then went to the bar for lunch/liquid lunch! Our waitress, Nikolette, could not have been friendlier or more helpful. We would go back based on her treatment of us alone! After serving us a few drinks and beginning to see the type of thing we liked, she made excellent recommendations about other choices from the beautiful cocktail and gin menu. 

The staff were equally helpful during breakfast and check out the next morning, and the breakfast food itself was one of the nicest I've had in any hotel. 

Thank you for a great stay Marker hotel, and particularly Nikolette. ",5,2017,04,05
206,Excellent hotel with outstanding service,I couldn't find anything wrong with the service or the Hotel . It operates with extreme professionalism and after a long day of tourism and also work it was a pleasure to arrived at the Hotel. I will go back.,5,2017,04,05
206,Room with a view,"We stayed at the marker for our honeymoon in march 2017. When we arrived they had decorated the room with rose petals and had macaroons, which were delicious. It was everything we expected. The service was fantastic and view from our room was unbelievable. We would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2017,04,05
206,Exceptional good Service and very comfortable rooms,The Hotel is in a very good condition. The service is more than excellent. This hotel is one of the best hotels I visit in terms of service and i am visting minimum more than ten Five-star Hotels a year worldwide. My wife and I will definitivelystay in this hotel when we have more time to visit Dublin.,5,2017,04,05
206,Perfect weekend break,"My Fiance (new) and I stayed at The Marker for a lovely weekend break in Dublin. Dublin is a special city to us and it is now even more special as my girlfriend accepted my marriage proposal in the beautiful Iveagh Gardens. I think that we would have to look a long way to find a hotel better than The Marker. The rooms, spa and breakfasts were all first class. Luxury with pretense!",5,2017,04,05
206,Fabulous weekend break with girls,"Really enjoyed the luxurious surrounds of this lovely hotel.  
Booking direct was easy and delivered exactly what I expected from my research.  
Food was superb.
Staff really attentive and engaging.
Only minor negative was that we could not get any treatments even though we called over a week in advance. Could have been because it was mothering Sunday -but there were not that many people using the spa so perhaps it was a question of staffing? ",5,2017,04,04
206,Superb Treat Venue,Worthy of a special occasion and a real treat if you can bump up the budget. A really special experience from the moment that we pulled up to the valet parking. The attention to detail was consistently high from all members of staff. Worth the wait!,5,2017,04,04
206,Even better second time round!,"We had a wonderful weekend in The Marker Hotel. We came back to celebrate our first wedding anniversary after spending our honeymoon here a year ago and loved it even more this time round. Wonderful staff who always make you feel like you are their no.1 priority, the simple little touches that make all the difference, the underfloor heated bathroom floor and the breakfast location and quality of food are just a few of the reasons why we love the Marker. Can't wait to come back next year. ",5,2017,04,04
206,Relaxed hotel,Had a pleasant stay - check in was difficult and the lack of access to roof terrace due to not having booked was frustrating (not told to book). The hotel was relaxed and service was good. Reminded us of the Lowry in Manchester but with far better service! ,4,2017,04,04
206,wonderful hotel for a fun weekend,This is a  beautiful hotel even more so if you'd like to be pampered. The staff is lovely - customer care is a real priority. We were made to feel special throughout our stay - nothing was too much trouble. ,5,2017,04,04
206,Superb,"We stayed here on an overnight break.  Was absolutely fantastic , food and drink were delicious, particularly the cocktails.  We were going to see a play in bord Gaia, so the location was perfect.  Would definitely recommend it to anyone and we will certainly go back.",5,2017,04,04
206,Dubliner taking a local break....,"I live in Dublin, very familiar with the city and the Marker and stayed for a one night treat. Excellent hotel, but what really stands out is the food at the Marker. Streets ahead of any hotel in Dublin and genuinely top class in its own right.",5,2017,04,04
206,Exceeded expectations ,"I have been here a couple of times and food, service etc all excellent. I had a work meeting this morning and had the usual problem with little battery on my smart phone.

Very impressed. ",5,2017,04,03
206,Amazing place,"Very well located at walking distance from Temple Bar and Trinity College. Excellent service and beautiful establishment. Staff is very kind and extremely helpful. Despite we arrived very early in the morning and our room was not ready yet, they gave us access to the spa, pool, showers, hot tub.",5,2017,04,03
206,Great hotel in Dublin,This is a great hotel in a really good location. Nice room and good service. My only issue was that after requesting early check in-- I had to go up and remind the front desk that I had been waiting for my room- 2 hours in the lobby--after seeing others walk in from the airport and get their rooms. ,5,2017,04,03
206,Excellent as always,Having stayed in this hotel a number of times I can't fault the level of service and the staff. My all time favourite hotel with staff so on their game it's makes the stay so enjoyable. Will be hoping to return to this hotel very soon. ,5,2017,04,03
206,Pleasant Stay Excellent location,"Very nice experience staying at the Marker hotel. The rooms were very pleasant, spacious and inviting. Hotel staff was courteous and helping. Conveniently located, 15 mints walk to Trinity College and central market.",5,2017,04,03
206,The Marker for a Five Star stay in Dublin,"I would use and recommend The Marker for a five start stay in Dublin for business or pleasure.

206,Best Service I have ever experienced!,We loved staying at the Marker Hotel. First time to Dublin and I will never stay anywhere else.

It made our vacation even better to experience this hotel and its people!,5,2017,04,02
206,"Great standards, good location","Convenient for work. Great rooms well equipped. Nice lap pool. Bar is good for small group gatherings. Didn't try the restaurant, so not sure. 20 minutes walking distance from the Temple Bar downtown area",4,2017,04,01
206,Sunrise on the docks,Excellent facility. Spacious rooms. Large beds with new mattress and luxurious bathroom. Modern design with highest standard of finishes. Lovely walk to old city center along the canal. Highly recommended.,5,2017,04,01
206,Decent,"They mistake my reservation because another person with the same name (different last name) made another reservation and decide to cancel mine with no advise.
Finally they find me a room (they were booked) and the situation was solved, but I was tired and didn¬¥t appretiate the situation",2,2017,03,31
206,BY Luca,Rooms in the back of the hotel are quiet. If you are arriving from an intercontinental flight the hotel will offer access to the spa to refresh yourself  while you wait for your room to be ready. However there is no relaxation area and you cannot order food in the spa: you will have to drag yourself back to the hotel bar: not ideal if you are jetlagged.,5,2017,03,31
206,Fabulous Marker stay,"Great hotel fabulous staff excellent people watching with just enough personlized service to make you want to return! The management are extremely detailed orientated and are very focuseed on making your stay personalized, I have stayed here prior and they welcome you back warmly, the hotel is buzzing and the common areas are inviting even when its busy. Its a fabulous place to stay for both business and leasuire. ",5,2017,03,31
206,Weekend away.,"Putting aside the price of breakfast, the hotel is generally fantastic, & the Staff too. Watch out for the super slippy floor to the pool though, & it took us about 40 minutes to check in as there was an issue with the hotels I.T system as we booked through Expedia. You'll hopefully meet Peter, who's about as good as they get, & not over friendly & false if you know what I mean.",4,2017,03,30
206,The heart of the Silicon Docks,"Excellent facility at the heart of the start-up world in Dublin, cozy and modern, easy access and check-in/out, great rooftop bar and terrasse, dynamic and relax overall atmosphere and service, comfortable and spacious rooms, easy access to the business area: the ADDRESS, mark The Marker!",5,2017,03,30

Will be back time and time again, thank you ",5,2017,03,29
206,Disappointed on the classification of 5 star,"I compare this hotel to other 5 star hotels that I have visited and for me this is not a 5 star hotel the lobby area is bland and more like an office or airport terminal. No ambience  or privacy in the bar ,noisy and located in the lobby",3,2017,03,29
206,Cool Weekend in Dublin,"A great hotel, by the dockside, with trendy bar and surroundings. A brisk 10 minute walk to town centre. Surrounded by some bars and restaurants  A little disappointed at rooftop bar being closed, but all in all a good experience. ",4,2017,03,29
206,Marker Hotel,"Not as good as expected.  

Friendly staff but everything kept turning up late.  An early morning breakfast before my flight ordered for 5.45 am turned up at 6.15 and was just cereal and yoghurt (cooked breakfasts are not available before 6.30 which isn't ideal for the business traveller.  The night before, we waited for drink at the bar for 20 minutes because they ran out of tequila.  The staff are lovely and very keen but for us at least kept missing the mark.  I was expecting ""fabulous"" and got ""fine"" (or grand as they would say in Ireland).  

A note to couples staying the weekend, the Brasserie is closed Sunday evenings, so if you want to eat, it's at the bar.  I was a bit disappointed at this although the bar food was perfectly okay, but not an ""event"", if you know what I mean (i.e. eating rather than dining).

In the pool area there were a couple of used band aids/plasters in or around the pool and the leatherette loungers there are badly scuffed and have seen better days.  Neither are big things but just maybe point to a place that maybe isn't 100% on its game.

Breakfast is fine, if unremarkable.  I was surprised at the supplements to be paid if you wanted for things like smoked salmon with your scrambled eggs.  I would normally expect these things to be included.  I have a Platinum Card with another hotel group and stay in hotels regularly and for the standard of hotel that The Marker purports to be, I would think they could afford to let guests have smoked salmon or eggs benedict without supplement.  I stay at the Radisson Blu in Dublin sometimes where the breakfast and the bar (if not the location) is far superior.

Rooms, particularly the bathrooms are excellent (much better than the Radisson Blu mentioned above).

I am staying here again in April, so hopefully will have a better experience.  I maybe just got unlucky.

",3,2017,03,29
206,Excellent Hotel and Staff,"Had a weekend stay at the fabulous Marker hotel.  Lovely hotel with amazing, friendly, happy staff and nothing is a hassle for them. Everything about our stay was perfect.  Best nights sleep I have ever had in a hotel.   Will definitely be back üçÄüíö",5,2017,03,29
206,Fantastic stay,"What a lovely stay in the Marker. It is a beautiful hotel. Our bedroom was fabulous, and the bathroom was lovely. The heated tiles were a lovely treat. The staff could not have been more helpful. They all went above and beyond to accommodate all our needs. The spa was so relaxing and restful, a really peaceful spa. The food was also beautiful. Highly recommend. ",5,2017,03,28
206,Great Location ,"Great Location and rooms . 

We tried to book the spa before coming by 2days and while we were there but there was not any slot .

We took a look at it and looks nice with a nice pool so something to think about in advance .

They have a roof top bar but apparently closed till April .

206,Best hotel in Dublin,"Service was excellent from the moment we pulled up outside, our car was parked for us. Check in was very good they got us into our room early and we availed of the late check out the next morning. Pool and jacuzzi where lovely

Breakfast was very good. ",5,2017,03,28

Thank you to all of the staff. ",5,2017,03,28
206,A few Surprises,"I stayed here on business as we are looking for an appropriate place for our clients to stay while visiting Ireland. The Staff were all amazing nothing less than wonderful and helpful. However, given the cost of a room per night and the 5-star rating I was slightly baffled by a few things. 

For example, we ordered drinks to the room (a simple order 2 drinks before dinner) after 45 minutes I rang back down to reception to enquire and was told that they had forgotten about the order. We were fully charged including service charge. Due to the delay, the drinks were left because we were late for the dinner reservation. 

In the spa nd swimming area again the staff were lovely, however, there was a plaster at the side of the pool (which happens) but the pool area isn't monitored so, therefore, the plaster remained floating in and out of the water.  

The shower door in the bathroom is not fitted correctly or needs to be resealed as the shower caused a mini flood even though I had the shower door shut over. Many towels were used to soak this up and to say it was dangerously slippy is an understatement. 

At breakfast the next it was a beautiful set up especially the real honeycomb. However, the scrambled eggs were vile. Fried or cooked in what tasted like old oil, I've never had eggs turn my stomach as much. Halfway throughout breakfast, I then noticed there was a used plaster on the table (was I being haunted by these things!) It had clearly come off someone's finger by mistake, perhaps the waitress. Needless to say between the eggs and that, I wasn't hungry. 

Overall a nice place with lovely staff. Is it 5 star or worth the price we paid, absolutely not. It was a real shame as they were only small details that can be easily fixed.I am glad we tested a stay here before we made any future bookings. 

I do not often leave feedback but I felt hard done by leaving this hotel, which was a real shame.",3,2017,03,28
206,Best Birthday Gift,"This was the best weekend trip ever. The staff were so helpful and friendly. Our room was absolutely amazing, great view, great bed and the shower and bath were absolutely amazing. We also had a customized birthday treat on arrival. Really made the whole experience very special. I can't wait to come back!",5,2017,03,28

206,Amazing hotel and service.,"The Marker is a modern hotel in Dublin 2. The staff and accommodations were top notch. Rooms had American outlet option, spacious bathrooms and a nice honesty bar with snacks and drinks. Concierge was helpful with directions. It is about a 20 minute walk to city center. We would suggest using the hop on and off buses for travel throughout the city. We left behind and item in the room and they were able to arrange shipping it home for us. The bar was always busy with great drink selections. Amazing staff. Highly recommend. ",5,2017,03,27
206,Spa Treatment treat alongside a business trip,I stayed overnight on a Sunday night for a business meeting early Monday taking advantage of the wonderful spa.  The treatments were very relaxing and in an excellent setting.  The staff were very attentive.  I didn't feel too awkward eating on my own in the relaxed bar area on the Sunday evening.  Perfect location for my business too.,5,2017,03,24
206,Great experience ,The Marker is my favourite hotel in Dublin perhaps even my favourite hotel anywhere. The staff are all extremely friendly and helpful.

Staying in the Marker is a real treat and I'll certainly be back.,5,2017,03,23
206,Business trip,"I stayed at The Marker during a short business trip to Dublin.  It really is a lovely hotel, it feels luxurious and expensive, but with incredibly down to earth service and reasonable cost.

Breakfast was fantastic, I could have sat there for the entire day, just so I could try everything.  It also has a lovely outlook onto the Docks of Dublin.  

Very much recommend.",5,2017,03,23

206,"Impeccable, Modern and Luxurious Hotel","My Wife and I have just returned from a short stay at the Marker Hotel in Grand Canal Square, in Dublin. I can't say enough about what a great experience this was; the staff were all incredibly friendly, helpful and polite and the hotel itself was modern, well appointed and well maintained. Sadly we didn't get a chance to enjoy the Spa as we were too busy in Dublin, but we definitely will next time (and there will be a next time!). Special thanks to Barney on the door for advice, maps and even an umbrella!",5,2017,03,22
206,A treat to stay in,"This was our 2nd time here, both times for a 1 night getaway. It's the one 5 star hotel in Ireland I've splashed out on and not left feeling I didn't get value for money.

The rooms are plush and the beds were perfect to us, great sleeping. The bathrooms were so good my wife and I both took time out just to use the lovely, deep bath. This despite also making use of the Spa which is worthwhile too and even having a treatment each there.

Regarding the Spa our treatments were top class and worth every penny. Was the highlight of our stay.

We only availed of breakfast at the hotel but gladly say that the buffet breakfast was top notch and it's hard not to try a bit of everything on offer, we were not disappointed by any part of it.

The Marker has become our Dublin favourite and can see us going back asap for our 3rd visit and probably many more in future too.",5,2017,03,22

206,Girls night away,Fab night away with the girls. Rooms were gorgeous. Pool and Jacuzzi fabulous. Food lovely.  Only downside was that the rooftop bar was closed. I appreciate that it was too cold for the outdoor terrace but it would have been great if there was an indoor part of the bar that could have been opened. The only bar available was just inside the foyer and was very busy and made it difficult to get seating on return from the Bord Gais. ,5,2017,03,21

I stayed for business but this would make a lovely hotel for a romantic getaway, I also hear the spa is good although I didn't get chance to visit.",4,2017,03,20
206,High-end hospitality,"I used the Marker Hotel to deliver a program on creating customer service excellence through quality leadership.  As well as the hotel itself being a living embodiment of the principles expounded ‚Äì Charlie Sheil, the Hotels' GM, agreed to come in and speak for 45 minutes on his own approach.  He was honest, engaging and, given that we had all experienced the fantastic hospitality of the hotel, highly credible.",5,2017,03,20
206,Great service,"Spent St Patrick's Day and then the 6 Nations rugby match. The Marker is extremely comfortable, huge bed, soft pillows, fluffy white towels. Breakfast was very relaxing, we got chatting to other rugby fans and ended up drinking Bellinis during breakfast.

206,"Great accommodations, lovely location","We stayed at the Marker for two nights after a long red eye from the states. I had emailed ahead requesting early check in and they were kind enough to allow us in at 10 am which was clutch after a long trip. Rooms were nice, modern, pretty view of the docks. 

What made this hotel stand out was the service. While the car service was not always available, when it was it was great. The driver was very friendly and polite. Plus the car was extremely comfortable. The front desk staff went above and beyond to make me comfortable. For example, I wanted to charge my phone in the car on the way to a concert and instead of leaving my cord with me, the driver took it back with him and placed it in my room for me so I would not risk losing it at the concert. This is something the staff offered, I didn't even have to ask!

In addition, Barry the concierge was amazing. Each morning I sat with him to plan my day out. He even booked my train tickets to the next city. His recommendations were personalized and spot on. He did not steer me wrong even once. 

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin.",5,2017,03,18
206,Probably the best hotel in Dublin,"It was a wonderful stay. The hotel is very modern, clean and the staff is great. Rooftop was closed during my stay (it would have been nice to know before) but apart from this, the overall experience was great!",5,2017,03,18
206,Perfect!,"Everything about this hotel was wonderful.  The staff are all so friendly, helpful and attentive.  Nothing is too much trouble.  The food is exceptional, especially the breakfast.  Whilst there,  it was my birthday.  The Hotel didn't know this but the housekeeping staff must have seen the birthday card in our room.  When we returned later in the day there was a beautiful  plate of cakes and fresh fruit with a Happy Birthday message from the hotel.  it was such a lovely surprise.  There was no problem arranging a late check-out..  I would definitely stay there again if vising Dublin and have no hesitation  recommending the hotel to others.",5,2017,03,17

206,Perfect Place,"The Marker is conveniently located to make exploring Dublin very enjoyable.  You can walk, or pickup tour bus which gives you endless possibilities to take all of Dublin in.  The Marker itself is a wonderful hotel, the staff is extremely helpful, and the entire facility is immaculate.  They offer a great restaurant, and several bars, the rooftop is amazing weather permitting.",5,2017,03,14

Staff exceptionally friendly and welcoming can not fault anything only wish that we had more time in the hotel as we were going to see a show.. will stay again In a heartbeat ",5,2017,03,13
206,Great service and lovely rooms,I stayed recently in the marker hotel to attend the opera with my mother in law. She has poor eyesight so we needed to be close to the theatre. I booked directly with the hotel and the girl in reservations couldn't have been more helpful. She is Irish so obviously English was her first language and this made the booking process an awful lot easier. We were upgraded to deluxe rooms which were adjoining. The rooms were lovely and also had a great view. The rooms were large and the beds were very comfortable. The staff throughout the hotel were extremely helpful and pleasant. The hotel has valet parking which was very handy when I was with my elderly mother in law. The only small criticism I would have is that the corridors are dimly lit which was a little difficult for my mother in law. The breakfast was included and it was very good. Some of the tables are a little close together. All in all I would certainly recommend the marker hotel.,5,2017,03,13
206,Dublin with style,Superb hotel can't wait to go back. From the moment we arrived the staff at this hotel were of exceptional standard.  The room was spacious and perfect room temperature. Even after check out we were allowed to leave our car in the hotel car park to avail of some retail therapy. Thought this was certainly an added bonus as car parking in the city is very expensive and quite a nightmare to drive round.,5,2017,03,13
206,Excellent Stay,"I spent two weeks in this hotel. This hotel used to be close to our Old office in Dublin and hence, was used by all my colleagues. Since it was my first ever visit to Dublin, well, any place in Europe, I went with what my colleagues stayed even though our new office was 20 min walk away. 

I didn't go to the roof top or had dinner at the hotel for the simple reason that I used to have Dinner with my colleagues before I came back. 

The staff are extremely polite and helpful. The rooms are excellent, clean. Wi-Fi is good. I did watch quite a number of Netflix series without any buffering issues. 

If you are a Smart Phone geek, then you can connect your phone with the Smart Tv and view your contents.

The bathroom, an element that I take very seriously while reviewing hotels, are of excellent quality. The cleanliness is amazing. A big bath tub, glass covered bathing space, huge mirror and a big sync complement the quality feeling it gave. 

In hotels, while they have hangars to keep your used clothes or suites, there is not enough length especially if you are hanging jeans, pants or dresses for women. In Marker, the length is excellent. My jeans (I'm 6ft) could hang to it's full length and still have enough space left at the bottom. I'm sure women will find it so comforting especially if they are wearing gowns or party wears. 

Mini bar - Nothing to write about it apart from the fact that they have it. 

The only challenge I found is using the kettle to heat the water. The kettle is placed inside a cupboard, spacious enough but towards the extreme left. It's a little awkward at time to life the kettle even though I never spilled anything. For your comfort, you still can take the entire kit out and place it near the main desk where they have plug points. 

Considering that we all have smart phones and laptops, the number of plug points was less. It shouldn't be a worry but incase you are heavy on usage of Laptop by two people, then manage accordingly. 

The gym was spacious enough and had enough equipments for a beginner to intermediate workout. That's more that enough considering that you are not going to spend much time in the gym. 

An amazing swimming pool which I used only once. Gosh, that's a mistake. haha. 

If you want to stay in this hotel, then go ahead. It's lovely.",5,2017,03,13
206,The Top Nr. 1 in Dublin,"I had a fantastic stay at The Marker. Even little things, like the music at the Bar or Restaurant or Breakfast-Buffet are perfect. The kitchen is excellent. The staff is very nice, the service is perfect. My next stay will be there, that's for sure!",5,2017,03,13
206,Excellence at The Marker Hotel,"A perfect stay with top service and standards throughout - absolute excellence and attention to detail and first class service.

206,Great place to stay,Definitely will stay again.  Expensive hotel but a real treat. Staff very nice and hotel impeccable. We arrived early from train and wanted to leave our bag and we were able to use our room straight away. ,5,2017,03,12
206,Overnight Stay,"Everyone at the hotel was extremely friendly and accommodating from check-in to check-out, it was an experience in itself! Hope to come back soon and visit the spa aso I didn't get to try them this time.",5,2017,03,12
206,Experiences of a Disabled Guest,"Facilities for a wheelchair bound guest are top class!  Bord Gais theatre is across the road (without sidewalks or steps) which makes the sojourn at the Marker seamless from the viewpoint of the disabled person and partner (husband in this case).  Service is excellent and the wheelchair access rooms large enough for everyone to relax without effort.  I am most impressed by the courtesy of the staff.  The brasserie is impressive and my family were accommodated with the minimum of fuss.
My only quibble is the Bar area.  A residents' bar would help solve this one.  Local businesses descend on the hotel at Lunch and evening - very understandable!  However residents are unable to find a space, often despite the best efforts of the bar staff.  This must be the most unpopular job for the Bar Manager of the night - how does he / she come to terms with the Good and the Great / residents / theatre attendees / the Lads from the local Firm / Hen Do.  Give him / her a break and develop a separate Resident's lounge with all the space available to you.

206,What a great hotel,"Very friendly and helpful staff, everything worked, great rooms, good food. Great experience overall. Getting to the hotel by road is challenging, because you have to go around it and in the afternoon, even though can see it, it takes you 15mins to get to it. But other than that this was one of my best hotel experiences while traveling for work.",5,2017,03,12

There are a few restaurants in the area but it does get quiet at night. Highly recommended.",5,2017,03,10
206,confirm your booking - reservations manager a law onto himself.,"Advise caution on using the Marker website for you booking as they do not honor their reservations.  Booked on the 14th of Jan and this was changed by the Marker 2 days before my arrival, I think it was because I booked a package including dinner. My dinner reservation was downgraded to Bar food, and room also downgraded, reservation manager emailed me to say he was upgrading my room, Not the case. Stayed in a better room last year for a lower room rate. Advise caution.",1,2017,03,09

206,Great people but very dark,"When I first flew into Sheremetyevo airport 30 something years ago, the thing which struck me was how gloomy it was. Perestroika was in the air but the Soviets still used low power bulbs. Visiting the Marker brought on a sense of deja vu; stumbling through the Stygian gloom of darkened corridors, rooms in which it was hard to read... and it wasn't just us; two chance met guests remarked on it and even the taxi driver referred to the lack of light. Great location for the Finance District, friendly, efficient staff, comfortable rooms... come on guys, high powered LED's are not expensive any more. Fiat lux",3,2017,03,09
206,Lovely hotel and very friendly staff,The hotel was lovely and our room was very spacious.

The hotel is a nice walk to the city center on a good day of course if its raining not so much . The one thing I do not like is the bar area ,its in the foyer and its very hard to get a seat , the rooftop bar when open is a lovely spot to go .Overall this hotel is great ,relaxing and classy at the same time   ",5,2017,03,07

206,Excelent Hotel in Dublin,"Ver nice and modern in Dublin. Service is exceptional and very welcoming. I experienced some problem of noise in my room due to the very windy weather and the staff reallocated me immediately in the presidential suite where I stayed until the end of my trip.
The only downside : the hotel is located in a very modern part of Dublin but a little bit far from the point of interests. Need to walk around 20 mn (or take a cab) to go to the more traditional parts of the city. No issue if you go for business trip.",5,2017,03,06

Upon arrival I was met by a very impressive concierge (Barry) as I got out of my car, he proceeded to take my bag and walk me into reception asking me about my journey ""very impressed""

I checked in and again bags brought to my room which was very bright and modern.

The bathroom had a heated floor which I really liked with everything I required.

206,Weekend break,"The hotel was excellent. The staff were very friendly, helpful and professional at all times. The only one point would be the restaurant menu was not very good.

206,Sleek... yet a bit out of the way,"Due to tailwinds we arrived, exhausted, at an ungodly early hour. Yet the amazingly helpful front desk staff found a room for us until our appointed check-in time. And that same front desk staff were top-notch throughout our 3-night stay. Our room was considerably large and the bathroom was beautiful (marble, heated floors/towel racks, etc.). The Marker had more of a business hotel feel, almost a bit sterile. Yet it is unbelievably quiet and its breakfast buffetis plentiful and delicious. It is not ideally located to Central Dublin and many of the popular 'sites' but if you don't mind a leisurely stroll, you can be at Trinity College in 15 minutes. The Marker is clean! and it's bar/lounge sizable and social.",4,2017,02,26

My room was a good size, very well appointed, modern and clean. The Restaurant was excellent as was the bar. The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful.
Often with new hotels they are very formulaic but The Marker is quite individual and well worth returning to.
It is located centrally for most of the financial district as well as other restaurants and bars. My only complaint is that I was only here for one day. I would love to have stayed longer.
I would thoroughly recommend anyone to stay.",5,2017,02,23
206,A great experience in a vibrant part of Dublin,"Really interesting and relaxing stay in the Marker Hotel.  The welcome was very warm and friendly and the location was really interesting, close to the centre of Dublin but also in the new exciting High-Tec area.  Dublin is a great city to visit.",5,2017,02,22
206,40th Birthday Celebrations in style,A lovely hotel. Our room was excellent and the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. Our little girl (age 7) was catered for in every way and was treated like a princess. The Nutella she got with her pancakes made her day. We will definitely stay again. ,5,2017,02,22
206,Experience exceeded expectation,"Fabulous room, excellent service, personal touch. All staff very friendly, especially would like to mention Leon and chef Gareth, who's culinary expertise is out of this world. Now if I am going to stay in Dublin overnight Marker is THE only option.

206,Simply amazing,Amazing location staff were fantastic giving us the best places to visit. The room was clean and modern. I would most certainly stay here again. The Guinness storehouse is a must go!! Perfect weekend break.?,5,2017,02,21
206,AMAZING,"We was spend a very good weekend in this Hotel and the staff it was  very efficient and kind!

The Hotel it's located in the new Dublin area opposite the canal.
It is an area whit a very young people and very relaxing!

Would highly recommend this to anyone staying in Dublin for a weekend. ",5,2017,02,21
206,Enjoyable weekend break,I had heard good things about The Marker Hotel and I wasn't disappointed with my experience there. Top class staff and facilities. Great location. The hotel staff were very accommodating with my request to check in early and a late diner reservation wasn't an issue for them either. The valet parking was very useful also.,5,2017,02,21
206,Lovely Stay,We had the Le Drunch offer so the late check out at 4pm was brilliant. We used the thermal suites which were very relaxing. Great atmosphere in the hotel. I would highly recommend the stay. Very clean hotel,4,2017,02,21
206,Fantastic short break,"Excellent room, view and facilities. Nice to come back to the spa after a day exploring Dublin. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Looking forward to returning to enjoy the roof top bar in the summer.",5,2017,02,20
206,"Great, modern stay","With impeccable service, lovely food, a happening bar, and comfortable rooms, the Marker doesn't leave much to be desired. Nice touches like the heated marble bathroom floors and top hats on the concierges edge the experience toward luxury without all of the expense.",5,2017,02,20
206,Mixed view,"Mixed view of this hotel. Stayed for a 2 night break as a treat for my girlfriends birthday. The check-in/reception staff were excellent, we mentioned it was my girlfriends birthday, and the next day a small cake and birthday message were waiting in the room for her... nice touch. 
 The hotel is of a very high standard, and the spa and pool area probably the best I have seen in a hotel. 

However, a few things were not what I would expect from a 5 star hotel, and marred our opinion of the hotel somewhat...   The shower and sink in our room were partially blocked, to the extent that the water overflowed into the bathroom when showering, soaking the floor and the bathmat. The underfloor heating also wasn't working, so we had a cold wet bathroom floor all weekend. We did advise the hotel of this and was told it would be fixed, but wasn't. They did however bring a free cocktail up to the room by way of an apology. 
We were particularly unhappy with the bar at the hotel, the first evening we tried to go for a drink, but after about 10 minutes of waiting to be served in the quiet bar, we eventually gave up and went elsewhere.  The second night the bar was quite busy, and we were shown to a small table and chairs which seemed to be a side table for someone else's proper table. We pointed out that there were other more comfortable empty tables, but were told they were reserved (although nobody actually used that table in the hour or so we were there). We had 2 rounds of the same drinks, and were charged 2 different prices...  not sure how that works.
Overall we were mostly happy with our stay at the hotel, and would probably return.... but would be hoping for a more 5 star experience next time",3,2017,02,20
206,Comfortable and New,"Had a great long weekend stay at this seemingly brand new, luxury hotel.  Although expensive, we received an upgraded suite and breakfast buffet was included.  The breakfast selection was vast and the food was excellent including made-to-order eggs.  The wait staff were friendly and helpful especially Gabriel in the bar.",5,2017,02,19
206,Perfect choice,Very nice hotel very convenient in the center of the silicon docks and 5 minutes away from the Dublin Convention Center. Very clean brand new very large rooms. Excellent breakfast. Good selection for business meetings.,5,2017,02,19
206,Exceeded all expectations,The Marker Hotel is beautiful with such a relaxing ambience. The staff were wonderful and very accommodating. The rooms were so clean and comfortable. This will be my hotel of choice in Dublin forever more.,5,2017,02,19
206,Contemporary and chic hotel!,"Great stay. Hotel design is cool, and the staff is very friendly. I had a short stay so couldn't use much of the facilities, but I had a comfortable time. It was expensive but the experience was luxurious! Would like to stay bit longer and enjoy the dining, spa, and rooftop bar (in summer).",5,2017,02,18
206,"Lovely hotel, made to feel like a real 5 star by the amazing staff","We stayed for one night for my gf's birthday. (It was meant to be a surprise but I blurted it out!)

The hotel itself is stunning from the moment you walk in. The staff are exceptionally nice, but in a good way! No BS, they're reserved & just have the craic with you without being fake or over the top, like in many hotels.

The buffet breakfast is the usual mass cooked slop you get anywhere else but good god, anything from the menu is out of this world! We couldn't believe that having paid for the full buffet that we could actually order from the menu too, and it was included! 

The rooms are very very basic with the exception of the bathroom, which has both a bath & walk in shower, and heated floor tiles!

The colour scene in the rooms should match the elegance of the hallways. I mean you walk down this dark, fancy looking hallway only to open the door to your room & think you've just stepped in Jury's Inn.

All in all, we'd go back in the morning if we could but there are some minor things that make it feel much more like a 4 star hotel. 

Again, the staff were just amazing.",4,2017,02,17
206,Valentines break,Highly recommend room service breakfast it was delicious and arrived within 20mins. They allowed us an hours later checkout and printed our boarding passes for us to collect at checkout. We arrived at the hotel at 11am presuming we would have to leave out bags and come back at 3pm but they checked us in straight away.,5,2017,02,17
206,"Great hotel, but a bit pricey for what you get.","Great location, great staff, great rooms & spa.  But a little too pricey for what it is. Breakfast was ok, would have been better eating out.  Perfect for a business stay, maybe not so much a chill out spot :)",4,2017,02,16
206,Excellent Hotel,"This hotel was located outside of the hustle and bustle of the city centre but was still only a 15 minute walk to everything. The walk itself was pleasant along the waterfront. The hotel is contemporary with excellent service. We did not get to experience the rooftop bar as it was closed at this time of the year but it looks great. The location of the hotel was good, right next to the theatre .",5,2017,02,16
206,Nice And Modern Hotel,Room space was great. Staff surprised me with a cake for my partner's birthday. Everyone was very helpful from the begging of our stay up until the last minute. Would definitely recommend for all sorts of celebration!,5,2017,02,15
206,Execellent  hotel,We have stayed at the Marker on quite a few occasions and we have never been disappointed.  This hotel provides a brilliant service from you pull up outside to avail of the valet parking until you leave with complementary bottles of water placed in the car for your journey - nice touch! It's a Great location and the spa facilities are very good too.   ,5,2017,02,15
206,How a new city hotel should be,"This appeared to be an efficient, well managed hotel with a positive, capable and well led team. 
The breakfast was expensive and a little limited given the cost.  
The staff throughout the hotel were relaxed, confident and extremely helpful. They exhbited no sign that they were expecting or looking for a tip in return for their high level of sevice.
Taf were efficient and effective when accessing taxis for the guests.  ",4,2017,02,15
206,Spa day,"Best I've had totally amazing , hotel has a very plush feeling food menu and spa menu to die for and brought home some cronuts made fresh each day 
Straight across from theatre rebooked as soon as I left",5,2017,02,14
206,landrover brecon,"from the time of pulling up out side, my hole stay was very nice.
very nice welcome, very nice staff, good food and a lovely room.
what more could you ask for. 
keep it up.
when I next visit Dublin I would like to stay hear again.",5,2017,02,14
206,"Good, modern facilities that will need some work soon. Very well located, excellent service. Not a lot more I can say.","Good modern facilities, will need some work soon. Very well located with excellent service. Not a lot more I can say for a short stay. Perhaps the bedding can be improved. I would also recommend to change the drapes some time soon.",4,2017,02,13
206,Amazing hotel with first class service,"This review will be short and sweet, as I could go on all day about our wonderful stay..

Hotel was amazing, when you walk into the ultra-modern foyer you are blown away. Greeted by a very friendly concierge who is full of information, tips and craic! I believe his name was Barry, and he was brilliant!

We went for a Gin on the rooftop bar, and my goodness am I glad we did.. Amazing views, amazing service and even some sunshine!

Barry then advised us to try FX Buckely, one of a chain of steakhouse's in Dublin City. Another great recommendation, one of the best steaks I have ever had.. 10/10 for that recommendation!

Rooms/Pool were also so fresh and modern, not a complaint about either. 

Would 100% recommend this hotel for anyone staying in Dublin for whatever reason.",5,2017,02,12
206,Splendid,Very soothing atmosphere here in the lounge area. Perfect to get some cocktails and read the newspaper. Four of us just got coffee. Dealt with Bruno while paying who was extremely nice. Will certainly be returning. ,5,2017,02,12
206,Nice hotel in the docklands district,"If you want a modern high quality hotel in the dock area of dublin, then this is worth a try. Staff were very attentive even when it was particularly busy. We stayed here as we were with part of a large company booking. Looks like the hotel caters for that type of thing. The room was excellent and of a high standard. If i was to be critical the reception, downstairs and bar area all lacked any warmth or sense of occasion considering the cost of the rooms per night.",4,2017,02,11
206,Great hotel for comfortable stay in Dublin,"I liked everything about Marker: nice comfortable room, large enough and with everything you need when travelling on business. The breakfast choice might be better for the price e.g. include poached eggs. As a vegetarian I found the selection meat-heavy.",5,2017,02,09
206,Short weekend away,"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The service, room, breakfast and spa facilities were great. We liked that the hotel is within walking distance to the city centre, but is also located in a nice area near to a couple of nice bars and restaurants. We would definitely return. 
",5,2017,02,07
206,The Marker,"This is an excellent hotel. Very comfortable, very nice staff, good food service, also near good restaurants. Very short taxi ride to city center and staff will always get a taxi to the door instantly. I love this hotel, have stayed here many times, and plan to stay many more.",5,2017,02,07
206,Superb hotel,"We stayed here recently for a quiet break, the hotel staff are extremely professional, polite and helpful. We had a really great break and will no doubt return. The hotel bar was lively and the hotel is overall a superb place to stay.",5,2017,02,07
206,The best place in Dublin to celebrate a special occasion,"From the wonderful property, to the excellent staff and exceptional service that they bring; the Marker met, and better yet, exceeded the high expectations that I had during my stay. Why high expectations? A quick browse through the reviews right here on TripAdvisor proves that many guests arrive there with the same high expectations, and clearly, the staff at the Marker quite competently manage to make each and every one of them feel special. Enough can't be said of the setting itself; in short - a blissful haven!",5,2017,02,07
206,Best Dublin hotel,"We stayed at the Marker hotel on a midweek break. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty.  We had an early morning flight, having emailed ahead for an early check in we were not disappointed our room was ready.  The hotel ooozes class in every way.  The staff were the best, nothing was too much trouble and we were always greeted personally.  The breakfast and evening meals were top quality.  For our anniversary we're had a bottle of champagne, dipped chocolates and anniversary wishes.  The spa was one of the best, Amy made my treatment special.  The pool, jacuzzi and other facilities were great especially as we had such terrible weather for our stay.  We cannot fault anything about the Marker hotel, it was a very enjoyable luxury stay. ",5,2017,02,06
206,Highly recommended ,"Stayed here for our anniversary and it was perfect from start to finish. The room was beautiful with a great view. All the staff we encountered were so helpful and friendly. 
We took advantage of the rooftop bar and enjoyed some amazing cocktails whilst taking in the view (wrap up warm if it's windy though) I definitely suggest leave time to visit the spa/pool facilities as they are simply beautiful.
 I almost forgot, a lovely touch was the complimentary dessert sent to our room with happy anniversary written in chocolate - attention to detail like this really makes the difference and we shall definitely be back next time we're in Dublin. ",5,2017,02,06
206,Wonderful Spa Hotel,"My partner and I visited for a long weekend at the end of Jan, and were blown away by the wonderful service we received from arrival to departure.
The staff go above and beyond to make you feel welcome and taken care of.

The spa was lovely, we each had a massage, my partner wasn't as keen on his but mine was perfect. The spa staff were friendly, helpful and approachable.

The restaurant (Bistro) was ok, the food was nice but it didn't feel like a restaurant, more like a breakfast area.

Overall though I really liked this hotel and would go back if I was visiting Dublin again.",4,2017,02,06
206,"Excellent, relaxing escape!","Lovely night away, staff very friendly. Hotel clean and the most delicious breakfast I have every had in a hotel! Enjoyed every moment from start to finish only wish it could have been longer. Great location!",5,2017,02,06
206,excellent break,from check in to checkout everything was wonderfull. We arrived earlier than expected but were still allowed into our room early . The room was immaculate and although our view was not over the dock  was still pleasant . The staff were very courteous and helpfull throughout our stay . The Location is great  being close to main airlink bus stop and easy walk into centre of city . The swimming pool and facilities are wonderful . In all  a great hotel .,5,2017,02,06
206,Great stay at The Marker Hotel,"Great stay at the Marker Hotel - beds were very comfortable, bathroom was a great size with a bath and shower. The staff were friendly and attentive - I couldn't have asked for a better stay. I would recommend staying here while in Dublin",5,2017,02,06
206,Alan,"Great staff, attentive. A very enjoyable stay. In a great location, we were attending a concert in 3 
Arena, and were able to walk to the hotel after the concert.
We enjoyed the pool facilities, which was a real added (and unexepected) bonus",5,2017,02,05
206,Just excellent!,"Amazing how The Marker manages to have consistently excellence in service. And great atmosphere, beautiful design and valanced choice of food & beverages, including raw juices and veggies. And best spa treatment ever, including relaxation area afterwards! ",5,2017,02,04
206,Birthday Celebration,"We stayed at this hotel while attending a friends 50th Birthday party in Dublin.  It is definitely Dublin's it hotel. We had a fantastic stay for 3 nights.  Our room was great we had a corner suite (upgrade at hotel). Breakfast was definitely something to do at your leisure, do not rush as it is a lovely experience.  Apart from the obvious full Irish breakfast they have lots of amazing fruits, spread, Irish yogurts, a ""Honey Comb"" amazing fresh breads, pastries, juices etc.   We did have a bad experience in the restaurant on the first night which could have been dealt with more professionally but all in all a great experience. Would return when I save up enough money!",4,2017,02,03
206,great hotel,"Great hotel, stayed here for work recently.  Clean spacious rooms, friendly service and conveniently located to the finance centre and the tech offices of Facebook, Deloitte and others.  Would recommend and look forward to going back.",5,2017,02,03
206,Great conference location,Fantastic conference room for business or weddings. Friendly staff and 5 star treatment. Excellent food and large lounge area. Near Bord G√°is theatre and port Bason. You will need to call a cab if you want to explore the city ,5,2017,02,01
206,5 star lifestyle,"We tend to only book 5 star hotels and resorts when we travel -- on a world scale -- the Marker Hotel ranks high as one of favourite hotels.  Their staff are well trained, incredibly courteous and helpful.  The quality shows from room service to conceirge to front desk.  I highly recommend it. ",5,2017,02,01
206,First time in Dublin,"Grea,t stylish and comfortable hotel. Good restaurant, lively bar and  excellent spa.Only minor reservation for the less mobile is that it is about 25 mins walk from city centre. very nice walk, though along the river Liffey.",5,2017,02,01
206,Weekend Dublin break,"Fab hotel with charming, helpful staff. Clean friendly and relaxed. 
the rooms and bathroom were fabulous although the air con was a little enthusiastic.
Swimming pool and Jacuzzi were just what the Dr ordered and Dublin isn't too far a walk or taxi away. 
",4,2017,02,01
206,Amazing experience as always,"Having stayed at the Marker before we knew what to expect from our hosts. The building and staff compliment each other so well. The unique architecture separates the Marker from others, standing out as a perfect example of excellence, mindfullness and well being to those who are privillaged to encounter it's vibe, if only for a short while.  Staff seem to have absorbed and embraced this concept, treating guests with full regard and respect.  From arrival to departure we felt the warmth. Will revisit time and time again. Really can't wait. ",5,2017,02,01
206,Perfect for a treat in Dublin ,"I spent the weekend in Dublin and stayed 2 nights at The Marker. The hotel is just what you would expect from a 5 star a plush, attentive and professional staff, all the amenities you would need and a few thoughtful extras like a heated bathroom floor. The housekeeping staff went the extra mile with thoughtful touches - a flannel for our own toiletries and tidying up our chargers into a neat cable coil. Also a very nice list of wines for room service and an atmospheric bar in the lobby perfect for a nightcap when we arrived late on Friday night. ",5,2017,01,31
206,Gorgeous... however,"Problems with breakfast- ordered eggs which never came. 
Partners French toast was NOT good. 
Experience in the spa could have been improved- was left waiting a lot and felt pressured to upgrade packages",4,2017,01,31
206,Rooms could be better,"Overall a great hotel . Staff are very friendly . Thought the rooms where a bit on the small side and we had no bath , for the money we paid for the room I would be expecting a bath . Also stayed for a night and had to pay ‚Ç¨30 for the car park that is underneath the hotel ! ",4,2017,01,31
206,Excellent really good service,When we got there it was well before our check in time however they found us our room and cleaned it for us. Which they didn't have to do because check in was from 2pm. Greeted at the door and check in process was smooth with a smile. Would definitely stay here again and I would highly recommend others to stay here.,5,2017,01,31
206,Great Hotel,"Great location, so we had a fantastic stay. The rooms have a good size. Just in bathroom it is a little bit dark but the facilities are great. Breakfast is excellent, the staff very friedly. 
I have just one bad write-up: It is not possible to eat at the bar after 10 p.m. ",5,2017,01,31
206,Excellent customer service,"I am really delighted to give this hotel five stars. It has world class amenities and the staff I can't rave on enough. My trio needed to add on a second room to our stay and at 5am, Nutu, the night manager was extremely helpful and accommodating in making that happen. The hotel is about a mile from O'Connell Street but we appreciated the quiet. And don't be fooled by its off the beaten path location; it is surrounded by a theater, shops, bars, and restaurants. Everyone from the bellman to the housekeeping staff to management was welcoming. And to give it even bigger kudos: we booked on Hotwire and I feel we were given the same treatment as we would have received had we booked through them directly. I've experienced poor CS in other hotels when they know you've booked at a discounted rate. Thankfully, the Marker treats everyone well. And again, big thanks to Nutu!",5,2017,01,30
206,None better,Recently traveled to Dublin and stayed at the Marker. This review will be short because I can not add anything other than it was a fantastic stay. The Marker is first class in everything you expect in a 5 star hotel. Highly recommend!!,5,2017,01,30
206,good location,"excellent location for business, nice view, close to theater, only 25 min walk from temple bar, good food and excellent breakfast. Room of good size but sorry not to be able to open windows. Air conditioning noisy in the room and not easy to adjust temperature. ",4,2017,01,30
206,Excellent choice to stay at Dublin,"The marker is definately the best hotel when you stay in Dublin. With modern looks and up-to-date facilities, it provides top-quality services ranging from concierge, room to foods. Amenities are also recommendable :) ",5,2017,01,30
206,Belated birthday,Went hear for my belated birthday as I work away and miss my birthday and Christmas had a really lovely stay and the little cake was a nice touch from the hotel. Over all had a lovely stay and would highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2017,01,30
206,Luxurious but...,"During check-in, the receptionist was trying to have me pay more for an upgraded room.  Even as I said no, she kept pushing me even more.  She used sleazy sales tactics like ""but sir, if you could just take a look at this beautiful room, you will change your mind.""  I have never experienced anything like this before, and quite frankly I was very upset.  All I wanted was to get in my room and get some sleep after a long plane ride!

Also, the hotel is not close to the Temple Bar area, about 20-25 mins walk.",3,2017,01,29
206,"Great hotel, good location","Very nice hotel, modern style, hotel staff very kind and useful to make your stay as most enjoyable as possible. Spacious room, restaurant good. Good location not too far from CBD, great view on Hanover Quay.",5,2017,01,29
206,Superb Hotel. Great Staff.,"Consistently good and welcoming service. Lovely rooms and the bathrooms are a great size with quality showers. It's a short taxi ride or 20 minute walk to central Dublin - so not ideal if you want to walk out your door and feel you're in old Dublin but nice, modern area on the canals. ",5,2017,01,29
206,Totally Impressed,"The Marker is a newer hotel by the Liffey in Dublin. Its in the techie area of the historic city.  This hotel is among the best I've stayed in, combining a trendy setting, elegance, modern architecture, and a superb staff. The rooms are new and well appointed with plenty of space and amenities. We were able to visit the rooftop bar and meet the chef at the main restaurant. We had two meals - a lunch and a dinner at the hotel and both were great. Also visited with the hotel GM (Roisin) who has a lot to be proud of. I have already sent friends to stay at the Marker. It's not in the central part of the city -- the most touristy part, which we thought was a plus. The Marker is a short cab or Lyft ride from Temple Bar. It's also next to the famed Bord Gais Theatre. The Marker is Worthy of Five Stars. ",5,2017,01,28
206,"Lovely place to stay, just a little far out from the main town","We stayed here in the run up to Christmas. The hotel is very nice and the suite we stayed in was spacious and will decorated with a lovely bathroom and shower and a very comfortable and enormous bed. 

Breakfast was fantastic with a lovely selection of hot and cold food.

It's located in a very picturesque area of the Dublin Canal area, especially at night, but it is a longer distance from the centre of town. It was about 20 minutes walk to the main high street area south of the river and a further twenty minutes to the Guinness Storehouse.

I would stay here again but I would not go for the high range rooms again.",4,2017,01,27
206,Relaxing birthday break,We stayed at the Marker hotel for a weekend break in January. From start to finish staff were excellent and rooms beautiful (we stayed in a superior room overlooking the canal). We had delicious food and cocktails in the bar on the Saturday night. The only downside is that at times it was difficult getting a table in the bar as there was a queue of people waiting and staff were trying their best to accommodate everyone even though most weren't residents. Overall I would highly recommend The Marker and look forward to visiting again in the summer when it's warmer and we can enjoy the lovely outside area. ,5,2017,01,26
206,stay the marker,"overall very pleasant. No issues - food in the bar wasn't that great - but that aside, recommended place to stay. v well located for the business district. The d√©cor is a little on the dark side - you might need a torch to negotiate the corridors but that aside, nice place.",4,2017,01,26
206,Luxury spa at great prices.,"I visited the spa here in November and with my mum.  I was really nicely surprised, it is one of the better spa's I have been too.  Staff are friendly,  knowledgable and attentive. The decor is stylish, peaceful and relaxing.  Amenities are great and we had a fabulous time. It is a great city spa.  I have been to many spa's around the world and this is up there with the best I have experienced. The price was great, they do mid week specials that are great value.",5,2017,01,25
206,Excellent hotel in Dublin,"Our third stay at the Marker - and we'll return again in future. Staying here is a real treat. The bedroom and bathroom were large, modern and spotless. The staff are friendly and helpful. A mysterious addition to our room bill for food and wine that were not ours (we ate elsewhere) was immediately rectified at check-out, which was appreciated. Right beside the Bord Gais Energy Theatre and surrounded by modern buildings that include some restaurants, cafes and bars. The main city centre shopping and eating areas are within a 20 min walk.",5,2017,01,25
206,Great location,"This is a Great hotel with modern facilities and has an excellent pool and spa. The hotel is very conveniently located. Whilst on in the centre one can walk in about 15 minutes
Rooms are spacious and very clean. ",5,2017,01,25
206,Excellent,"I was in January in this hotel with my couple
It was an increidible experience. The service in the hotel is very nice and it's in a really good location. Not in the middle of Dublin but next to the Convention Center
The rooms are big and the brakfeast is really good (mainly the fruit) ",5,2017,01,25
206,Could be better,"The hotel is amazing, you can't deny that however for the money we did expect more. The pool and jacuzzi were cold! There were only two loungers at the pool aswell so we couldn't even chill out with a book there. We spent 30mins in the pool area and we were really disappointed with it. Everything else was really nice, rooms, staff and breakfast were all perfect but we booked in here to have a nice relaxing night in the pool area but this didn't happen. It's a small thing to fix but would have made our experience perfect if it was right!! ",3,2017,01,24
206,Very good modern hotel.,"Well placed clean hotel. Very pleasant staff, the bathroom is the highlight of the room - great underfloor heating.

Also visited the restaurant - which is well worth a try, although not busy it would seem.

Would come again

P.S it looks like a death star",5,2017,01,24

206,Escape Night,"Excellent hotel and excellent staff from the minute you walked through the door, was very dissapointed with my spa treatment tough.  Would recommend the hotel, but unsure about the signature treatment which was what I had. ",5,2017,01,23
206,Watch out for the shower,Great hotel in a great location. Only serious minus is the shower. It comes without a build-in thermostat which means that you one moment find yourself nearly scalded and next minut in a state of cold shock. ,4,2017,01,23
206,Best night in Dublin I could of asked for,"Rooms are brilliant, front desk was great. they really made the whole thing feel special. Couldn't recommend more. It's in a great location in Dublin, we live in Dublin and decided to spend the night here fora special occasion and it really felt like we were away in any other country. The area of Grand Canal is one of the nicest in Dublin and has so much to offer. ",5,2017,01,23
206,Lovely 5* Experience,"Really lovely SPA and dinner experience. The whole visit felt really luxurious and staff were at all times really professional. 

One downside was that the SPA pool area was really busy when we went with alot of children. This took away from our relaxing experience, but I guess it is difficult for the hotel to refuse their hotel guests the facilities.",4,2017,01,22
206,Only one night for a job interview,I stayed only for one night and the hotel was very nice. I did not have time to enjoy any of the many facilities but the view was great. The bathroom was great. I did not have breakfast included and the ones provided by the hotel were too expensive for me.,5,2017,01,22
206,It deserves the 5 stars and much more,"My stay was short but all the people of the staff ware very kind.
A very confortable room, huge bathroom and unbeatable location.

I asked for a plug and in less than 3 minutes, reception provided me one.
Very good pace.",5,2017,01,22
206,Hits every mark,"From start to finish our stay at the market was impeccable. The food in the Brasserie was excellent value (pre theatre menu) and small touches, such as the water left in our car when returned by valet",5,2017,01,22
206,Luxury and relaxation,"The hotel has had a beautiful renovation, and we enjoyed the relaxing spa, the delicious breakfast, with a wonderfully kind staff. While it is not in the city centre, there is a complimentary car service within a 3km radius.",5,2017,01,21
206,Pure Luxury,"Love love love The Marker Hotel, excellent all round. Location right beside the Board Gais Theatre in a magnificent area of Dublin & walking distance to City Centre. Staff amazing, food delicious, can't wait to go back again. They parked up my car for the night & when they brought it back there were two little water bottles in it for the drive home & a new air freshener. Its all about the little things.",5,2017,01,19
206,"Fantastic stay, would definitely recommend!","Everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel. From arriving to checking out nothing was too much trouble for the staff and they made you feel incredibly welcome. From the little touches in the rooms such as the pillow menu and well-stocked mini bar to the talented spa therapists. The Hotel was incredibly clean and up to date. Fantastic value and great location, we thought we would have to get a Taxi into Dublin City Centre and to the Guinness Factory however we found it was only a 20 minute walk which was great. I slept great, the beds were incredibly comfy and there was a variety of pillows available to request on the pillow menu. The room was a great size too with a separate bath and shower. The only thing I would say in the rooms is that I would have liked to have been able to dim the lights in the bathroom, however that's only personal preference and not a reflection on the Hotel. If I return to Dublin I will not hesitate to book the Marker Hotel again.",5,2017,01,18
206,Thank You,"Thank you for a lovely stay, 
I enjoy every minute at the marker hotel and have stayed more then once! 
I highly recommend the marker to friends and family. 
I would really appreciate a discount or voucher for my next stay.",5,2017,01,17
206,Fantastic weekend away,"Lovely modern hotel. Hotel rooms, spacious, clean and comfy, food in the restaurant amazing but what makes this hotel is its staff, friendly, helpful and attentive, first class service throughout our stay. ",5,2017,01,17
206,Fantastic hotel with exceptional staff,"Husband and I ended up coming to Dublin last week for a last minute  business trip. 
It was a sheer luck that we were able to book a room at The Marker (they were fully booked and someone cancelled last minute) as it made a whole difference to our Dublin experience. This place is fantastic, : simple, modern, clean. 
Our room was spacious and comfortable. We really enjoyed the spa with large swimming pool and great saun. 

We travel on business frequently and spent a lot of time in World class hotels but never experience this level of hospitality. People who work here go above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need. Special thanks to Ms.Kasia and Mr.Robert. Next time we are in Dublin we will definitely stay here!",5,2017,01,17
206,Perfect Location,"Excellent Location. Staff very professional and helpful.  Restaurant food wonderful.  This hotel is ideal if you are going to the Bord Gais for a show as it is right beside it.  The rooms are spotless and the beds are very comfortable.  Overall a very satisfied customer here and I would return.
",5,2017,01,17
206,Short Break,"First class service, nothing was to much trouble and all the staff were very helpfull and friendly.
Location was just right, not to close to city center. About a ten minute walk. The room we had had a
fantastic view, which we didn't expect in a city. The room was very clean and modern.",5,2017,01,17
206,Would definitely recommend it!,"Very nice hotel with very friendly helpful staff. Nice quiet area, didn't hear anything in our room, from outside or from other rooms. Great breakfast. Lovely swimming pool with sauna, steam room & jacuzzi. Would definitely go back. ",5,2017,01,17

206,Business Trip,excellent service provided and staff were very friendly and helpful. it is a great location within the city centre. Hotel room and facilities are modern and exceptionally clean throughout. Under floor bathroom heating is a nice touch,5,2017,01,16
206,Great Hotel but very warm,"We stayed here a night and it was fabulous except for the heat in the room. I know it is always better than being too cold but it was over powering even with the air con.
Aside from this the service is top class and the staff are really friendly and seem to enjoy working there. The decor in both the hotel and the rooms is really excellent. We did not have dinner but breakfast offered a great choice of really top class food. 
We used the car park valet and they left two bottles of water in the car which was a lovely touch!!",4,2017,01,16
206,Pre-theatre Dinner,"Ideally located for the Bord Gais Theatre so we had dinner before going to a show. Food was excellent, wine was excellent & service was excellent. They had a pre-theatre menu with a great selection & well priced for delicious food. Very enjoyable evening. ",5,2017,01,15
206,Always look forward to The Marker,"The Marker is among my favorite business class hotels in Europe.  Well appointed facility, friendly staff, great location, good value.  I've stayed there several times, and have had a consistently great experience.",5,2017,01,15
206,Great night away at The Marker hotel,"Myself and my partner often attend shows in the Bord Gais Energy Theatre. Each time we attend a show, we say that we should spend a night in this fabulous hotel. At Christmas, we decided to do just that. We were really impressed with this hotel from the moment we checked in until the moment we checked out. The staff were friendly and attentive. The room was spotless and very well equipped. The manager assisted me in helping my partner to celebrate his birthday by putting a complimentary birthday dessert platter with tea and coffee in the room for us. We spent an hour in the spa upon arrival. It was very enjoyable, we particularly liked the eucalyptus steam room. We ate in the restaurant that night before the show. The food was gorgeous and we could not fault it. The location was great and the valet parking was efficient - complimentary water & air freshner included. Overall, we would love to return to this beautiful hotel and hopefully will be soon.",5,2017,01,15
206,"Very nice, classy hotel in a good location","The Marker was a very nice, classy hotel in a cool location (if you want to be near the docks area), clean, relatively spacious and well-appointed rooms, heated floor in the bathoom (first time I've ever seen that!), and very good food in the restaurant downstairs (for breakfast anyway, both a la carte and their breakfast buffet).

Not too much in the way of nightlife within walking distance, though that may not be a major concern.  There is a Fresh market across the plaza for snacks, groceries, etc. to stock up if you need.  The only minor downsides were (1) the walls, or may it was the door, connected to the adjoining room wasn't particularly soundproof, so I could hear my neighbor Skyping away, and (2) it was a rather chilly time I was there, and the hotel's heating system didn't quite seem up to the task (but not unbearably so, and that's a bit typical for European HVAC technology in any event).",4,2017,01,14
206,Lovely place and staff,"The hotel itself is fabulous, also went to the spa. It was nice and enjoyed that, also staff were accommodating. It seemed to be missing a little something but for a hotel in the heart of the city you can't complain about that!",4,2017,01,14
206,Brilliant,"Amazing place to stay, everything first class and highly recommended.

 Rooms were comfortable and clean, spa was lovely and tranquil and staff couldn't do more to please. would love to come back.

206,Pure Luxury,"An amazing place to stay, wish we had more time to enjoy the Hotel. Amazing buffet breakfast, rooms were comfortable and clean, spa was lovely and tranquil and staff couldn't do more to please. would love to come back.",5,2017,01,12
206,OUTSTANDING,"From the moment we arrived, until the moment we left ,we were 'CARED FOR' by the most outstanding staff we have ever encountered around the world. We only live a short distance from here, however, we will definitely be making the Marker Hotel our regular little getaway!!!!  :)",5,2017,01,11
206,"Great hotel, but child unfriendly","This hotel is remarkable. Great rooms, superb service and above it all is the food. Best food I had in Dublin. However the swimming pool is not open for kids at all times. There are some dead hours in the afternoon from Noon to 3pm or something like that where kids can go in the pool. I've never seen a luxury hotel that restricts kids. The highlight for kids when they are away from home (being dragged by their parents) is the swimming pool. My daughter was so disappointed that we could not go and after we paid 250/night.",4,2017,01,11
206,Relaxing stay.,"We stayed for one night and we really enjoyed ourselves. From the doormen who parked the car to reception and bar the staff we found everyone very courteous. When we arrived we had a drink and a snack in the bar area in reception and then went to our room to leave our things in. The beds are very comfortable, the room was spacious and clean and the shower was fabulous. They have a really nice pool and Jacuzzi area with sauna and steam room which you can use free of charge. I found their treatments expensive so didn‚Äôt have any.  We went out that night for dinner so by the time we got back we had missed the roof top bar as it was closed.  We slept really well and id go back again. Great location if you‚Äôre on a weekend with the girls or you‚Äôre going the The Bord G√°is Energy Theatre. Breakfast wasn‚Äôt included so skipped it.",4,2017,01,11
206,No words describe this place ,"Just stunning from start to Finnish! The best service I have ever received in 21 years of traveling and staying in hotels ! Truely amazing! Amazing location in the heart of Dublin, but a lovely spa to get away from all the madness that comes with Ireland capital city! 
",5,2017,01,11
206,"Beautiful, modern","The staff was lovely, the beds were comfortable, and the spa facilities were excellent. The only downside (we stayed around NYE) was that we weren't super close to happening bars/restaurants. One big highlight was that I didn't see any children staying in the hotel - which means the amazing pool and steam room were quiet and peaceful. ",5,2017,01,10
206,The Marker Hotel Dublin,I stayed in the Marker with two friends and we had a fantastic experience. We stayed in a corner suite which was beautiful although slightly smaller than I thought it would be for the money.  The staff were extremely friendly and the breakfast was amazing.  We attended the Spa and had treatments which were also fantastic.,5,2017,01,10
206,Wonderful hotel with excellent servce.,"We're from Dublin and choose The Marker to celebrate NYE. From our booking right through to our departure the staff could not have been more processional, warm and efficient. The room was spacious with high ceilings and a perfectly appointed bathroom. At the NYE drinks reception the staff made a point of introducing themselves to us and chatting about our plans while we there. The six course tasting menu was sublime and despite the weather the staff made sure that we were able to ring in the New Year on the roof top bar. Definitely one of my favorite places to stay.",5,2017,01,10
206,Superb,"I visited the Marker for the 5th time on Saturday 07Jan17.  My wife and I love the hotel, it is a real treat.  So much so we got our parents an overnight stay as a Christmas gift so they to can have the Marker experience.  We had a fantastic stay once again, we would not expect anything less as the hotel has such high standards.  You really do receive a 5 Star experience.",5,2017,01,10
206,Marker hotel,Very enjoyable. Daughter of 11 was welcomed however the facilities and lounge area were not overly family friendly. The hotel in general was very clean and its location was perfect for our trip to bord gais theatre. ,5,2017,01,10
206,Great hotel!,"Great hotel. Staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Food in the bar is very good. Cocktails excellent. Rooms & swimming pool also very good. Nice location in a quieter part of Dublin, but still (fairly) close to tram stop and train station.",5,2017,01,10
206,Fabulous Stay,"My wife and I stayed here for our wedding anniversary in December 2016. It was a wonderful place to spend time in Dublin. Great hotel and facilities, very helpful staff and excellent location to catch a show at the Bord Gais Theatre.",5,2017,01,09
206,Excellent service,"A top class Hotel is defined by the service it offers its guests. The staff at the Marker Hotel make the difference, they are exceptional. The Hotel itself is modern and comfortable but so are lots of others the difference is the service. Literally everyone we came in contact with was friendly efficient and genuinely helpful. Rooms are spacious and breakfast selection is extensive, the only minor complaint is the tables are a little close together. Treat yourself. ",5,2017,01,08
206,Best hotel I've stayed at in Dublin,"I can't fault this hotel. My husband & I stayed for one night over the Christmas break and are already talking about going back. The room was lovely, very spacious and I really liked the heated floor in the bathroom, the food at the bar was delicious, I loved the spa and the concierge couldn't have been more helpful when we asked for advise on where to go for dinner that evening.

Thank you to all the staff for a wonderful stay.",5,2017,01,08
206,Excellent Hotel,My husband and I were both very pleased at the quality of service at the Marker. The rooms were clean and the whole facility was great. We would return in a heartbeat if we ever find ourselves back in Dublin!,5,2017,01,08
206,Amazing hotel,"Best hotel in Ireland hands down!! Perfect in every way, service top quality, cleanliness 10 out of 10 and staff/service 10 out of 10, such an enjoyable stay in the market and so handy to Dublin City centre ",5,2017,01,08
206,The Marker Hotel ,"Excellent hotel very friendly and helpful staff, ideal location for the theatre and city centre. Great view from our forth floor room of the quayside and theatre. Food selection and quality excellent and bar area very nice with great selection of drinks. Would definitely recommend! ",5,2017,01,08
206,Relaxing ,"Just returned from a very relaxing two night stay with my friend.. hotel is beautiful & understated, staff are all very polite & helpful. Rooms are spacious with extremely comfy beds. We also enjoyed an amazing massage at the spa which topped off our stay... I would highly recommend this hotel, we couldn't fault anything at all. ",5,2017,01,07
206,Romantic city break,Ideal city break location and airport bus stops nearby. Great bedroom view and beds. The staff were some of the best I have come across in all the hotels I have stayed in across Europe. The roof top car is a great attraction but only open during better months of the year,5,2017,01,06
206,"Amazing, immaculate hotel; we felt soo welcome.","Staff are so welcoming and friendly - from the Valet to the room service, cleaning staff to the maintenance men, receptionists to the therapists. Beautiful hotel. Staff take a genuine interest in you.",5,2017,01,05
206,A real jewel in Dublin,"I have had the pleasure of staying in amazing hotels and resorts around the world. If I have to rank The Marker, it will be in the top two places, above or similar, in my humble opinion, to Mandarin Oriental and the Four Seasons. Everything and everyone were just perfect. Quite and very comfortable rooms, outstandingly superb service, great locations and views, excellent food, all that topped wth the famous Irish friendliness and your are experiencing a one of a kind, amazing stay. Highly recommended. ",5,2017,01,05
206,Exceptional !!!,"We stayed two nights over New Year, our second visit to the hotel this year and yet again we were blown away. Despite the hotel being fully booked we were treated like we were the only guests sraying there from the moment we arrived. The hotels design , facilities and cleanliness are fantastic but it is the staff who make this an exceptional place to stay. We have been fortunate to travel all around the world but have never found staff to equal to those in the Marker they are so helpful, friendly ,courteous and professional without even a hint of being pretentious, where else would senior management go to the trouble of wishing guests a happy new year at breakfast on New Years Days! A special mention for Stephan De Fries, the front office manager who bent over backwards to make our stay special from start to finish. Without doubt this is the best hotel in Dublin, see you all again very soon .!!!",5,2017,01,05
206,Relaxing post-Christmas break.,"Interesting architecture and location - a healthy walk away from the city centre. Excellent facilities and friendly, knowledgeable staff. One of the best breakfasts we've experienced in a hotel. Lovely swimming pool.",5,2017,01,05
206,Great Stay,"The rooms are so quiet!!! I have stayed in many hotels and this is honestly the only hotel you cannot hear anyone moving about or staff going along the corridors, if you value peace and quiet and a great sleep, stay in this hotel

This is the 4th time I have stayed at the Marker in the last 3 years and each time has been a wonderful as the last. I would truly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a top quality hotel",5,2017,01,05
206,New Years Eve Stay,"Excellent hotel. Staff were very welcoming and went out of their way to say hello and check we had everything we needed. Ordered room service on the first night of our stay and ate at the Marker Bar on the second night. Food was great on both occasions. Location of hotel was also better than expected, Grafton street was only a 15 minute walk away and there were shops, bars and restaurants close by. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to be spoilt for the weekend. ",5,2017,01,05
206,The best City hotel we have stayed in!,"The Marker hotel really does set the bar when it comes to city hotel living.

The minute we walked in we knew we was welcome and in for a pleasant stay.

I can honestly say that the whole team in this hotel from the Manager's all the way to the cleaners, make the Marker hotel stand alone from others, not just in Dublin am saying the World.

206,Worth very penny (or euro!),"Amazing hotel, exceeded our expectations. The hotel staff are incredibly friendly, swell as the food and cocktails are brilliant, made me a straight daiquiri even though it wasn't on the menu. 

The spa is really worth your visit even if you don't get a treatment! 

would love to return, 5 star!",5,2017,01,04
206,Excellent staff in a very good hotel facility,"Very good facilities with excellent staff in calm ambient implanted on a quite zone, near river/canal area, providing some good walking/jogging. In the interior, a good spa, gym and 23 meter swiming pool, complementary facilities that for sure should be used.",5,2017,01,04
206,Modern Hotel with excellent Service,"We had a three night stay over New Years Eve and found it very enjoyable.The hotel is located in the modern surroundings of the former docks, a nice 20 minutes walk along the river to the city centre. 
Very friendly and caring staff, spacious rooms with all necessary equipment, mini bar etc., large swimming pool/SPA, good restaurant and a nice roof top bar. Good food and breakfast in the Brasserie restaurant; only little downside: breakfast buffet was rich, but all the same every morning. A bit more variety would be appreciated, but there was also an option to order special items individually.
Very recommendable hotel if you want to stay at a calm place away from the crowded city centre.",5,2017,01,04
206,Great experience,"The Marker Hotel provides a unique experience in terms of comfort and service. Everything was of a high standard of quality : rooms, personnel, spa area, design of the hotel... We have spent 4 great days !",5,2017,01,04
206,Top class hotel for New Year break,"First class hotel - very stylish. Fabulous facilities in an excellent location, very friendly staff. Rooms very spacious, modern and fab bathroom with under floor heating which was a lovely treat over the cold New Year period! Spa and pool area was very relaxing and although we never experienced a treatment, the 'menu' certainly looked appealing! An all round fabulous hotel!",5,2017,01,04
206,Enjoyable and very nice hotel and Staff,"Nice hotel with very friendly and attentive staff. Rooms spacious, modern and clean which made for enjoyable trip. Did not get chance to use the facilities but they looked good and the roof top bar would have been good had it not been December and raining would make a good place to relax on a warm summers day over looking for the city ..",5,2017,01,03
206,Weekend break,"We had a most enjoyable time. Room was fabulous, breakfast excellent. All staff were most helpful. Rooftop bar - view fabulous - a real treat before going out to dinner in City Centre. Hotel also nice walking distance from Grafton Street.",5,2017,01,03
206,from TOURNAI BELGIUM,"Very nice place to stay for a couple of days and enjoy the spa close to the center CLOSE TO THE . close to the center ... I will probably choose this hotel for my next stay in DUBLIN (once a year at least...)
",4,2017,01,03
206,Fabulous hotel!,"Modern, trendy and clean. Great staff, big rooms and bathrooms. Great food. Staff are very friendly and courteous. Ate in the evening and breakfast and both were very good. Would highly recommend and would definitely try and stay there again when visiting Dublin.",5,2017,01,03
206,Weekend stay at the marker hotel,"After booking the hotel over the phone I had a good feeling about this place and I wasn't wrong. First class all round. From having my car parked for me,getting doors opened and luggage carried to my room by very polite hotel staff. They make you feel special at the marker hotel. Beautiful rooms,great breakfast,great food and drink. Easily the best hotel that I have ever stayed in and I've stayed in 100s of hotels. The marker beats them all,hands down..",5,2017,01,03
206,Great service,"Only great things to say across the board but mostly service !  All the employees without exception are charming, genuinely helpful and enthusiastic.  Great food, good sized rooms, great spa - and not the ridiculous prices of iconic Dublin hotels. ",5,2017,01,03
206,Very cold lobby,"Hotel itself is lovely and staff are very friendly and helpful, however we went to the lobby bar for a drink after our meal but ended up leaving and going to our room early as every time the main lobby doors opened, a breeze that would cut you in two ripped through the lobby, making it very uncomfortable.",4,2017,01,03
206,A real treat,"Wonderful wonderful hotel...quite expensive but a real treat. The complimentary upgrade wasn't bad also! I would thoroughly recommend staying here....such a relaxing environment but yet all the amenities, sights and sounds of a bustling city on your doorstep.",5,2017,01,03
206,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed for one night on New Year's Eve, hotel and staff are all excellent. Couldn't fault any of it. My one criticism, is that on New Year's Eve night at midnight there was no party atmosphere, quite disappointing. Again not taking away from the hotel just personal opinion. 
Staff couldn't have been nicer. Will definitely be back.",5,2017,01,03
206,Treat to ourselves,"Our second stay at The Marker- Very impressive. Staff ever so friendly, eye for detail and courteous.
First evening my husband on arrival was feeling under the weather, Liam offered to contact a doctor but it was not  that severe just a 24 hr bug, he recovered after a good nights sleep. They also checked up on him the next day at breakfast. very caring. Staff all very cheerful and helpful.",5,2017,01,03
206,Fantastic  Service,"My husband booked us into the Marker Hotel as a present for me as I have always raved about this hotel and recommended it to others to visit. I have to give credit to the exceptional service we received right from our check in experience. 

Our dinner experience was nice, although the table we reserved was taken when we arrived down and my food was luke warm, the staff responded very professionally. 

The room was lovely and clean and the bathroom underfloor heating was luxurious. I had the most amazing massage from Amy, a huge thank you to her. 

The only downside was the air conditioning noise that kept me awake for hours, which resulted in a grumpy and tired me the next morning, which prevented me from using the spa facilities and getting down for breakfast. 

We enjoyed the roof top bar and had a lovely stay overall. 

I would recommend providing more shampoo for couples as one bottle is not enough for two people. 

I would recommend this hotel and if you go you have to book a treatment with Amy. It's worth every penny. 

Compliments to the five star service received throughout the hotel. This makes the hotel a five star one. ",5,2017,01,02
206,Weekend break,"My family had a wonderful stay. All the hotel employees were polite and helpful. The spa was an excellent experience.
They were so accommodating with our young children and made us feel so welcome. Thank you.",5,2017,01,02
206,The jury is still out,"Mixed feelings about this hotel.We booked on there own website and received an upgrade to a deluxe room over looking the square on the first floor near the lift !!!!!.
Hotel staff very nice and welcoming.  I would like to give it another try to see if the hotel it self growes on me ",3,2017,01,02
206,Excellent stay in a stylish city hotel,"This hotel was modern, stylish and refined. The room was clean, spacious and very comfortable. We would be very happy to stay here for a week! We loved the extra nice touches like the coffee plunger for two, Malin & Goetz toiletries, heated marble bathroom floor etc. which helped to elevate the overall hotel experience.

The spa and gym was also very nice. The gym had all the right equipment even though it's not that big. There's a sauna and a steam room attached to the pool - both very clean and well maintained.

Service was attentive and very professional. Turn-down service was offered which is again a nice welcomed touch.

Overall we would highly recommend this hotel - great for romantic breaks or as a base to explore the city. If you're considering to stay in this hotel, book directly with them through their website to get free breakfast and complimentary upgrade.",5,2017,01,01
206,Best Service in Dublin,"My family stayed for two nights over New Year.  Without exception everyone working in this hotel was pleasant, helpful and eager to please.  Young, friendly, international - great food and atmosphere.  Highly recommend !",5,2017,01,01
206,"Beautiful hotel, pity about the AC",A real treat. We wanted to have a little pampering and this did the trick. Our only complaint is the noisy AC that we thought we had switched off but spoiled our sleep a little- the air was so dry we had sore noses and chests when we woke. ,4,2017,01,01
206,Lovely hotel but......,"We were given the stay along with tickets for a show as a gift and really enjoyed the experience. The service and attention to detail was excellent. Only problem was the cold buffet breakfast, we believe that a hotel of this class should provide freshly cooked breakfast to order. I mentioned it to reception when we checked out and the management were in touch almost immediately to apologise. It wouldn't stop us staying there again",5,2016,12,31
206,Christmas Treat,"Amazing staff. Modern architecture.   Lovely pool.  Decent location.  Rooms a little too minimalist and breakfast a bit disorganised  (but it was Christmas), but these arr minir pounts because the staff and service are excellent.",5,2016,12,31
206,Best spot in Dublin,Hotel and spa facilities are excellent throughout. Sophisticated and luxurious without being pretentious. Staff are very attentive. Little bit out of town but taxi ride only 7-10 ‚Ç¨. Possibly hotel could provide a shuttle service into to city centre? ,5,2016,12,31
206,Birthday surprise,Brought my husband as a surprise for his birthday. Beautiful hotel and amazing room. Dinner was average but breakfast was excellent. Had the lava shell massage at the spa which was amazing. Also yummy cocktails at the bar. Definitely recommend!,5,2016,12,28
206,Wonderful experience Wonderful Staff,"I attended the Marker hotel twice over the past weeks building up to Christmas and I have to say what an amazing place. 

I was nervous at start dining in this particular hotel as my usual dining experience would be limited to a more old style hotel like the Westbury or The Merrion. 

My first impression of the hotel was WOW the lobby is so modern yet so comfy, the concierge and front desk staff were jumping out of the desk to try and assist me on both occasions and which really added to the VIP experience.

The first night I dined was in the large event space called the ‚ÄòMarker suite‚Äô was a great atmosphere & the staff were really on the ball. One staff member in particular was more than helpful and really looked after my table and I. His name was ‚ÄòLorcan‚Äô which I am giving special recognition to because of his manner, was so polite and welcoming any request was without delay or issue (I am a coeliac which he had full knowledge of the menus and made sure everything was perfect after each course). At the end of the night as the food was excellent and so was the function I tried to give Lorcan a tip, he politely declined and asked instead could I pass on my thanks to a manager or a review (which I am doing now) which I thought was very professional.

My second experience of the hotel to my shock was even better. I was attending a product launch for a cosmetics company on the ‚ÄòRooftop Bar‚Äô and WOW. 

I must again say praise to the architects of the hotel as the roof space is simply breath taking. Upon arrival staff were giving out Strawberry virgin mojitos (as it was a lunch which were amazing) but who again was there to serve me the waiter Lorcan, he made sure to look after me with my requirements without me saying a thing and I thought what great customer service. Again excellent food from the chefs but the views from the roof were spectacular. 

After the meal I had to attend an interview downstairs with the cosmetics group and as I had no idea how to get there AGAIN the waiter Lorcan chose to help me out by escorting me to the room, after talking to him he really knew his stuff about the hotel from what the Marker name comes from to the shape of the building etc. he himself could not say more praise about the hotel saying that the hotel uses Irish products where it can pushing local produce into its kitchens which as a guest really gave me an even more positive look on the hotel. 
Upon leaving I felt tremendously pampered getting a full VIP experience. 

Lorcan and co. were probably one of the best waiting teams I‚Äôve seen in Dublin.
I definitely will be back again, encouraging my friends & family to visit this very unique but surprisingly indigenous hotel!

206,Pre-christmas night away,"Excellent choice from start to finish. We had eaten in the marker before but as a treat we decided to look at the offerings from Dublin 5 star hotels as a Xmas eve, eve treat. The Marker not only ticked all the boxes, but excelled in evert category. The only downside was a glitch in the heating of the pool resulted in the pool being too cold for the kids to use. Aside from this it was a great experience: quality, customer-centred, and a feeling (although we are from Dublin) of being in a city on the continent. A really great stay - from a normally not too effusive reviewer!",5,2016,12,26
206,Fabulous Hotel,Excellent hotel. Thanks in particular to concierge and gym manager for their help on Friday 23 December early morning which was much appreciated as we'd booked the hotel for its gym and pool facilities.,5,2016,12,25
206,Excellent stay,"I stayed for 7 nights as I was helping to organise a conference nearby. I also booked rooms for other participants. One of them commented positively about the hotel but added that it was ""the kind of hotel that an entrepreneur type would stay"". It is newly built and modern (about 3yrs old) so if you are looking for old world charm then this hotel is not for you. If you like top notch professional hotel service in a warm comfortable building with large light and airy rooms then stay here. Great facilities - not just your average tea kettle and fridge but heating you really can adjust and underfloor heating in the bathroom that you can switch on when needed (thoughtfully eco). The spa and swimming pool are a real sanctuary with a lovely infinity pool plus steam/sauna. Best hotel I've stay at in ages. I was in room 430 and although it looked out over the theatre and waterfront it was quiet. Great view!",5,2016,12,24
206,Fantastic hotel,"Stay here was fantastic from the moment we pulled up in the taxi and we were greeted by the doorman, extremely welcoming and helpful. Check in was friendly and quick, and despite arriving early in the morning our room was ready. The room was extremely clean and bed so very comfortable. The rooftop bar was wonderful, even in December, again staff very attentive, with ensuring we were warm enough with blankets. Cocktails delicious. Really cannot fault our stay. It was our 25th wedding anniversary and this place did not disappoint us in choosing it to celebrate this special occasion. Would definitely recommend and would not hesitate to stay again.",5,2016,12,23
206,My feed-back,"Excellent hotel.  Best place to rest or to work in a calm atmosphere.  Everybody is very kind...  The room is spacious and very comfortable.  Wonderfull staff always paying attention to your needs and anticipating!!
",5,2016,12,23
206,Amazing,Absolutely love this hotel. Pretty faultless! The staff are superb and extremely helpful and accommodating. The rooms are lovely and the breakfast was to die for. The spa and pool is beautiful ans very relaxing.,5,2016,12,22
206,Excellent service and amazing structure. Definitely the best hotel in Dublin,"I spent two days in the property in a standard room, which was stunning. The room and the bathroom were really spacious, clean, and cured in every detail. The personnel is available 24/7 and always very kind. You have the possibility to have breakfast in the hotel, and for 20‚Ç¨ you get access to a buffet able to meet everyone's tastes.",5,2016,12,22
206,"Almost, but not quite","We usually stay at The Merrion but left it too late to book this time, so we thought we would try this hotel as it is highly rated. The arrival and check-in was excellent. The front desk / concierge staff were excellent throughout our stay, probably the best I've experienced. 
We dined in The Brasserie on the first night (Saturday) and the food was very average and quite expensive. To be fair that is true of Dublin in general. 
We had 2 rooms (a superior twin 531 & a superior king 533) and while the bathroom in 531 was fine the bathroom in 533 was horrible. Black tile in a tiny room, shower in the bath, no handheld shower, no shelving! No way was this in the same category as the other bathroom. Beds are firm. Cleaning is excellent (don't underestimate the importance of this!)
At breakfast the first lot of porridge came out cold and watery. Second attempt was much better and it was great for the next 2 days so looks like it was a one off. Service was good most of the time, had to wave for coffee a couple of times. Ate in the lobby bar (fish and chips, club sandwich) and that was fine. Service was good.
This place has the potential to be great but the restaurant staff need a bit more polish, the food needs some magic and give someone a discount if they have to suffer that bathroom.",4,2016,12,22
206,Marker Hotel,"It's a perfect hotel for weekends or holiday in Dublin. I will come back with my husband and kids!!
Incredible friendly staff from check-in to check-out.
Merry christmas and a happy new year to you all. ",5,2016,12,21
206,Felt like a VIP,"I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. From the moment you step out of your car and begin your stay in the Marker, you are taken care of so well. Every member of staff has been trained to the highest of standards in customer care and I left the hotel feeling well taken care of and refreshed after the VIP service I experienced. Well worth the price as everything was impeccable. Amazing and will he back very very soon.",5,2016,12,20
206,My Favourite Dublin Hotel,"Staying at the Marker is an absolute pleasure. Five star service all the way, rooms beautifully appointed , breakfast delicious and excellent location close to city centre. Visited Rooftop Bar which was lovely ( only criticism would be to add more effective outdoor heaters) although staff provided blankets we still felt the chill. Staff are superbly trained and you are made feel welcome from the moment you step out of your car. Looking forward to visiting again soon.",5,2016,12,20
206,Weekend break,Brilliant night at the Marker. Nice relaxed atmosphere and the room was class. We received an upgrade for booking directly through the hotel website. The staff were very attentive and we will definitely return.,5,2016,12,20
206,Great as long as you don't need to sleep,"Very hard not to like a lot about this hotel but the very noisy early morning fan in the bedroom ruined my experience . Everything was fine up until then , but I do value my sleep and the noise was just too much in a room where we had turned off the air con and underfloor hearing so as not to be disturbed . It left me disappointed ",3,2016,12,20
206,"Best hotel in Dublin, seriously","Excellent true 5* hotel with great rooms, excellent personnel and fantastic facilities. Rooftoop bar is always crowded during the season, lobby bar has good selection of Irish whiskeys. Personnel is always quick and helpful in making sure your experience is great. It's unfortunate that this hotel is almost ever fully booked, this is the best hotel I've stayed in Dublin during last several years. ",5,2016,12,20
206,Truly outstanding hotel,"From the moment you check in until the time you leave, the staff simply cannot do enough to make your stay exceptional.

I was here just for one night on business, but plan to come back with my wife, next time we are ever in Dublin.",5,2016,12,20
206,Marker hotel,No complaints everything was perfect. Hotel room was very comfortable food was excellent.  Valet parking so had no worries of looking for car space. Did not manage to have a drink on rooftop hopefully next time we stay there.,5,2016,12,19
206,Congress stay,Very nice Hotel! Good Service and facility. Nice bar with friendly staff. Clean rooms with comfortable Equipment. Cery nice bath-room. Breakfast was very rich with a lot of choiche. Just the standard coffee might be better.,5,2016,12,19
206,Very poor,"I recently stayed at the marker hotel for a 2nd time and had yet again another bad experience I certainly don't think I am welcome in such a hotel first of all there wasnt space in the rooftop bar unless we wanted to sit in the cold at 2 degrees this was due to it being full with people coming in off the street surely at ‚Ç¨250 a night the guests would get priority? Well no secondly re returned from temple bar at 12am my business partner and our couples only to be told we would not be served a drink at the bar for no reason other than my own safety?? I wasn't drunk we walked into the hotel politely we wasn't stumbling or making a scene I purely think it was our appearance two young men in designer clothes with bald heads I guess is not there type of clientele, I didn't wear a top hat and dickie bow so they purely judged us on our looks, this really embarrassed not only me but my partner and our friends thirdly in the morning we went down to breakfast the buffet was cold and the plates were dirty, I've stayed at many hotels in Dublin and I honestly feel that I have been treated better in hotels at half the price in temple bar, so if your wanting to stay at this hotel and your a working class person who has not came from the royal family I suggest it won't be for you :)",2,2016,12,18
206,A perfect stay in a wonderful Hotel,"THE MARKER is one of the most comfortable Hotels in Dublin, with excellent facilities and a superb staff. This will certainly be in the forefront of my consciousness as I make choices for the future, whenever I need to book a Hotel in Dublin!",5,2016,12,18

206,Excellent,"Stayed for a work trip. It was a great stay, good size room, huge bathroom and good facilities in the room. Staff were all attentive and knowledgeable. Breakfast was good, but expensive for what it is.

Would definately come back for a personal stay",5,2016,12,17

206,The Making your stay fabulous Marker Hotel,Funky hotel in a fab location.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.    Food was delicious and reasonable. For me it was the little things like the air freshener and water in our car when we left. üëç,5,2016,12,13
206,Honeymoon in Dublin,"Unless you are going to the theatre or a rugby game, the Marker is not in a great location.  It is a 10-15 minute cab ride to the main part of Dublin (College, Guinness, shopping area)
Overall, the hotel was well maintained and professional, but was very overpriced for what it was.",3,2016,12,13
206,The Marker Hotel = EXCELLENT!,"The Marker Hotel is a phenomenal hotel experience. The food was excellent, the room was gorgeous, the staff were all really nice and helpful, the location is superb, and it was an overall fantastic hotel experience and I highly recommend this place to all.",5,2016,12,13
206,Drunch,"Met with a friend in the brasserie last Sunday..Great menu and fabulous staff.
I had the calamari and my friend the tiger prawn both were delicious.
I so enjoyed my waffle and southern fried chicken with a spicy maple syrup.
Will drunch it again no doubt.",5,2016,12,13
206,Fantastic experience at The Marker Hotel,"Excellent amenities, service/experience and location. Hotel is very close to the convention center (5 minute walk). If you have the time it is also only a 15-20 minute walk to St. Stephen's Shopping area (Grafton St.)",5,2016,12,13
206,Modern,"I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights. 

This modern, well-designed hotel located at grand canal square, and equipped almost all amenities I need. Room is big and was cleanly well-maintained. 
There is some distance from downtown, but this location made calm circumstances.

Also, staff are elegant and friendly. ",5,2016,12,13
206,Marker Hotel,"Great hotel in a fantastic location for shows or Gigs.  Very professional and helpful staff. The hotel was very clean, well-equipped, with spacious/modern rooms,... The team was really professional, fast, friendly, accessible",4,2016,12,13

206,Conference,"I stayed in the hotel for 3 days/2 nights to organize an international event. The hotel was very clean, well-equipped, with spacious/modern rooms,... The team was really professional, fast, friendly, accessible,...   Only 1 downside: the airco/heating is built in the ceiling on top of the bed. I had to switch it off before I got to sleep as I was constantly feeling the air coming out and heard a constant buzz.   ",4,2016,12,12
206,marvellous hotel,"This hotel did not disappoint from start th finish. Extremely helpful staff and beautiful decor and design. The underfloor heating in the bathroom is fabulous.

206,"Not cheap , excellent hotel and service worth every cent","From our experience, it is the best in Dublin, from handing over the keys of the car, the staff were there to help and please.The hotel is very central to the city and three area. Facilities are all that could be expected, the only fly in the ointment was the rooftop bar was closed at 11-20 when we returned from a concert on a Thursday night. apparently it stays open later on weekends and well worth visit if only for the views over Dublin.
When we checked out after a fantastic breakfast we were allowed to leave the car and go shopping and collect it later , a very much appreciated extra, saving us having to seek parking in the city. it comes at a price, however the standard of the hotel and service makes it worth while.",5,2016,12,11
206,Perfect stay!,"Everything was spot on. Not cheap but well worth the money. Room was a bit hot to sleep in, but that was minor. I hope to revisit.  Vriendlief staff, excellent breakfast. Good location. Nice, big room, fine bathroom.",5,2016,12,11
206,Avoid top floor rooms,The hotel it's definitely one of the best available in Dublin as it's probably the newest one but of it comes at a cost. Of course once you are ok with paying 300‚Ç¨ per night the experience should match the expectations. My personal suggestion after several occasions I had to be a guest in the Marker it is to definitely avoid top floors as they seem to have poor water pressure which implies a very bar showing experience both for the lack of water and for the constant change in temperature (from freezing cold to extremely hot) that will eventually make your morning shower miserable.,3,2016,12,10
206,Wonderful,"I truly enjoyed my second stay at the Marker. Staff are extremely friendly and aim to please. I love the bathrooms and the pool/spa area is beautiful. Beds are very comfortable and the room comes with kettle, slippers and bathrobe. The rooms are modern and clean. Breakfast choice is excellent. It was possible to get a complementary late check out which was much appreciated. I would definitely recommend the hotel and will surely stay again.",5,2016,12,09

206,Great Anniversary Night,I really cant compliment the Marker hotel enough on the staff that are working there. They are just amazing and look after all guests so well. I went to check in and the man at reception was both very courtious and very helpful. He gave all information required and looked after me so well. Even walked me to the lift. The rooms are clean and bright. The bar is fine. I prefer bars to be away from ground level but that's just personal choice. Great gym and pool area and complimentary newspaper hanging on the door the following morning was nice. We also had swans made from towels and some treats  for our anniversary also. Made the night. Only downside was that the rooftop bar was closed and we could not go up which was a disappointment. All in all though I would recommend staying for the service and the great staff alone.,5,2016,12,08
206,lovely trip to Dublin,"We had the most wonderful trip to Dublin the Marker hotel made it extra special. The service was excellent and the room beautiful. The breakfast and service was the best I have ever encountered

206,Great location for a weekend break.,"Great weekend location. Rooftop bar definitely a summer location, despite blankets.

206,Luxury Hotel Stay,"This is my 3rd or 4th stay in The Marker, and our 3rd as a couple, and each and every time the Marker exceeds our expectations. We were attending the Opera in the Board Gais Energy theatre, so took the opportunity to have a pre-show dinner in the Brasserie, proceeded by a cocktail in the rooftop bar. We love staying in The Marker. Everything about it exudes elegance and comfort. The staff are brilliant, friendly and courteous, always seem to know you've stayed before and refer to it, which is a lovely touch. The location is perfect and the interior of the hotel and the rooms are just so classy...if ever I could transpose a bathroom suite to my own house it would be the one in the Marker...in fact I'd have the whole bedroom, including the bed! We love staying there and will undoubtedly be back!",5,2016,12,06

206,Great Service - best hotel ever,"If it fits your price, don't doubt!
Did you ever go for a ciggy outside, when re-entering the building and a hotel employee told you ""welcome back, Sir""? Just an example of an awesome service in all the areas. BOOK IT!

206,Clean and comfortable luxury hotel,"I stayed one night at the Marker Hotel. The room was perfect (heating in the floor in the bathroom, shower AND bath) the service was personnalised, the staff was very kind and the breakfast was gorgeous! ",5,2016,12,03
206,"Excellent service, less than decent food","It Deserves 5 stars for quality in service, kindness and professionalism of staff, very clean and bright rooms, great location, but the food is not really at the level of the rest, just book outside...! ",4,2016,12,03
206,Very stylish!,"Stayed there for a weekend with family and had a good time. The rooms are not too small, but very stylish. The bar in the lobby is quite packed in the late afternoons, but nice, good bar food and drinks. The rooftop bar was a bid cold in November, but Irish people seemed to love it. Good views and nice staff. Breakfast seems very british/american, we missed nice cheese and cold meat cut. The Dockland area around the hotel is perfect for short and extended walks. We would go again.",4,2016,12,03
206,Most accommodating staff in Europe,"From the moment we booked online till the moment we left everything was flawless.  A special shout out to Hajnalka for making our stay perfect!  The hotel bent over backwards to accommodate my wife's special needs.
My wife has celiac ""gluten free"".  The hotel not only carries gluten free breads but understands the handling of food for no cross contamination.  The Sauna and pool were awesome after a day of touring the town.  The breakfast was unforgettable. Our server (I think her name was Kristina), even helped be carry up some food to the room.

The doorman for the rooftop deck was so polite and got us in the front on the line on a Friday night as we were guest of the hotel.  

I would give it 6 stars if it was possible.",5,2016,12,02
206,Good but not perfect,"It it a good place but nothing makes it different. In addition to the already commented, it does not belong to any loyalty program, so that this makes it less appealing for selecting it on a continuous basis",3,2016,12,02
206,Great service and ,"The hotel is located in a business district so don't expect much to see, however the hotel overlooking the grand canal which is really a great view in the morning. Everything seems to be within 10 minutes from the hotel so it's fine. The service and staff is amazing. Room are spacious and clean.  ",4,2016,12,01
206,Very nice hotel,"Got an upgrade for booking direct, still seemed like a relatively standard room although it did look out onto the square at the front of the hotel. Room was VERY quiet, can't say i noticed any noise from outside or from the corridor. Room was a good size with firm but comfortable bed. Excellent bathroom with nice modern fixtures, good size bath and large separate shower. Hotel itself is modern, the bar is in the foyer which I always find a bit odd, always prefer when it is enclosed in its own section of the hotel. Same goes for the restaurant where you have breakfast, it is just the other side of reception. Breakfast was good all the typical stuff, nothing to blow your mind but decent food, you wont go hungry not matter what your tastes. Parking is ‚Ç¨24 a night, there is a public car park just across the square (100 yards) that will do it for ‚Ç¨20 but you'll need to park it yourself as opposed to valet parking, I just went for the ‚Ç¨24 option. If you are in Dublin to go to the Bord Gais Theater then you can't get any closer it is literally directly across from the hotel. If you are visting Dublin city center then keep in mind that this hotel is not really in the city center and you will need a 10 min taxi ride to get downtown. All in all a good hotel",4,2016,11,30
206,6 star service ,"This hotel is situated in the 'Canary Wharf' of Dublin and is surrounded by some beautiful bars and restaurants. The interior is beautiful, the hotel is cosy with a large lounge as you walk in and a roof top bar which is very small so be sure to book if you want to go up. Now the room I didn't think was anything too special. The beds were comfy and it was nice enough but what made this hotel exceptional was the staff. They would not do enough for you. They even let us check out later and we're really coo about it. It was 6 star service. The spa was beautiful but again make sure you book. The hotel also lets you have the hoe of bikes included in the room so we took these out one morning. It was lovely and there is a bike path to follow. ",5,2016,11,30
206,Super location - good quality ,We recently stayed at The  Marker - convenient to see Swan Lake at The Bord Gais Theatre and it was great. Very chic & stylish. Staff very friendly & helpful. Breakfast excellent with good variety of local food. Highly recommended ,5,2016,11,29
206,Great Hotel,"We booked direct with the hotel and got an automatic upgrade to a really great room (I'm sure all the rooms are lovely). Lots of space - huge bathroom with separate shower and lovely toiletries. Bed was super comfy. Breakfast was excellent - fresh juices and a wonderful fruit salad plus lots of choices with cereal (even porridge), yogurt, breads, cheeses etc and a buffet hot section or you could order from the kitchen. Husband enjoyed the pool and steam room. Staff are really nice - efficient and helpful but young and friendly. Would definitely go back.",5,2016,11,29
206,Nice Stay,Lovely hotel with excellent staff in prime location. would recommend. Spa area is lovely to get away from all the madness of the city center. I have 1 issue is when checking out there always seems to be additional charges to the room from the bar in which someone has charged to which is very annoying when you are at the check out desk. ,4,2016,11,29

The cocktails were good and we got to go on the rooftop bar which was a fantastic way to end my Birthday evening with views over Dublin city.

I had asked for roll service which was delivered for our arrival...we even got a little extra and a happy birthday for him. We ate in the bar the staff could not have been any nicer. The food was gorgeous both in the bar and at breakfast in the brasserie. Our room was excellent. We were upgraded to a corner suite with a beautiful view of canal square. The bed was king size an so comfortable. Everything was just amazing. The best hotel we have ever stayed in. Definitely looking forward to going back again. ,5,2016,11,28
206,Disappointed this time,"This was a returning visit to the Market and we left abit disappointed. For a 5 star hotel we were very surprised there was no turn down service or refilling of water bottles. 

Service at breakfast was quite poor",3,2016,11,28
206,Nice and modern hotel at a walking distance of city center,"Located in the modern part of the city this hotel offers a fantastic stay for both business or pleasure travellers. Spacious rooms , nice spa and good brasserie with always people around. They deserve the 5 stars",5,2016,11,28
206,Fantastic hotel. A little walk to the centre ,"Stayed at The Marker for 2 nights on the weekend of the Ireland - Oz game. I had a 6th floor Superior Twin room, no breakfast.

Overall the hotel was excellent. Really nice modern interior, with the facilities to match.

Staff were great and very professional. Even the turn down service staff in the evening were extremely polite and respectful.

I made use of the gym and the swimming pool. These were great, especially for that morning freshen up.

I spent some time on the rooftop bar, both the Friday and the Saturday nights. Also, another great addition to this hotel, with some nice views at the top. 

.... the only small downside, is that it's not in the centre. Each morning I took the walk down the river, in which this hotel sits on. And it took me around 20/25 minutes. 
During the evening, a taxi cost me 11euro.

All, in all.. great! I'd stay again and would recommend it yes.",5,2016,11,28
206,Fabulous hotel with great staff,Excellent hotel with friendly helpful staff in all departments. We stayed in a superior room - fabulous from the huge bathroom to the fluffy bathrobes. Delicious meal from the pre theatre menu. Breakfast great too. Nothing was too much trouble. ,5,2016,11,27

206,Spa review,Had a massage after a brisk day of walking around.  It was really good.  Their gym is nice and the facilities are upgraded.  One downside was that the pool/jacuzzi/sauna/steam room are open to all hotel guests so it was quite busy.  There was also children running around playing w the jacuzzi.,4,2016,11,27
206,Very nice hotel!,"The location is good for my biusiness.

Not inexpensive but a touch of class. Recommended highly.",5,2016,11,27
206,"Fantastic hotel, phenomenal service","Very high quality hotel in great location.  Close enough to quickly walk into the city center, but far enough away from the madness.  The staff is also fantastic, attentive, particularly Liam and Godfrey.  Late one night, my room had a slight heating issue--which was fixed by a quick reset.  The next day, Liam called to make sure everything had been taken care of and offered my friend and I a drink at the bar for the inconvenience.  Once we were down there, Godfrey made sure we were taken care of and well attended to.  Top notch hotel and service!",5,2016,11,27
206,Fabrice,"I can only recommend this hotel to those who travel on business but also to those who want to spend a weekend or a longer stay in Dublin.

206,Wonderful Hotel.,"I luckily won a stay at this hotel and was treated to a real luxury experience. The service was second to none, the food was delicious, in particular the chocolate orange dessert at the brasserie and the open sandwich at the bar.

206,Excellent Hotel,"A great hotel great staff, great atmosphere, spotlessly clean and highly recommend this hotel. Bar is great on a night, nothing too much trouble for the staff.

206,The Marker in Dublin,"Very enjoyable hotel, great location.  The bar area is very pleasant and the breakfast worth getting up for.

206,5 Star Luxury from Start to Finish,"Everything was immaculate down to the finest of details! staff really do go above and beyond to make an enjoyable experience.

Would definitely stay here again!",5,2016,11,23

Concerige was great nothing too much trouble .
Saturday night was terrible a brawl outside our room 104 a guy was on the ground and another guying kicking him wife was very scared .
Breakfast ordered toast and the waiter looked at me as if i two heads 
I have stayed at this hotel before and couldnt have raved enough about it .",2,2016,11,23
206,Business Stay,"A lovely modern boutique hotel. The staff are all excellent, extremely friendly, helpful and well turned out. Unfortunately the restaurant was closed for a private function so I had an evening meal elsewhere but the breakfast was lovely. Great room - very clean with all the amenities you would expect. Spacious and comfortable. I would definitely recommend",5,2016,11,23
206,Not a hotel restaurant ,This place is great! I stayed here but I suspect pre theatre menu/experience is really good. Started with chestnut gnocchi which was sweet and herby and moved onto the venison... cooked perfectly medium rare. Very attentive service to boot. ,5,2016,11,22
206,Heated Bathroom Floors!,"We spent a few nights at The Marker when first arriving in Dublin. Everything was top-notch. The bed was soft and comfortable, the mini bar was well stocked, location wise it was close to lots to do-also a market which was very convenient. I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Dublin!  Also, the heated bathroom floor was so nice. I would never have thought haha",5,2016,11,22
206,AMAZING!!!!,"Absolutely loved this hotel and our stay! Cannot fault a single thing.  We were celebrating a birthday and the hotel were amazing, not only did they bring a small cake to the room on arrival, they also brought a dessert after dinner complete with candle for the birthday boy. It truly made our stay that extra bit special! The staff were incredible, so attentive and friendly, making us feel very special throughout our stay.  We would definitely return and will definitely recommend you to friends and family.  We already have not stopped talking about our weekend. Thanks you x",5,2016,11,22

206,Excellent stay in Dublin,"We were over from the Netherlands to Dublin visiting family. The room was superb, the bathroom even better. The location for us was perfect, close to the family. A 15 minutes walk to the city centre.
It was a pity that we did not have the time tomake use of the spa and the swimming pool. It looked very inviting. 
",5,2016,11,22
206,"Great hotel, great location","Good location for walks along the river. About a 40 minute walk to the main bar district, but far enough away if you like a little quiet. Plus, some nice brunch and cafe options witin a few minute walk of the hotel. If I returned to Dublin, I would stay at this hotel again. Highly recommend!  ",5,2016,11,22
206,Excellent Hotel 5 Star,"We found everything was to our satisfaction from our arrival at the Set Down, up to our departure,we intend to stay again on our next visit to Dublin.
Dinner in the Brasserie Restaurant was excellent as was the Service. 
This is a genuine 5 star Hotel!",5,2016,11,21
206,Best hotel in Dublin,"Excellent modern hotel with all of the basics such as a comfortable bed, wi-fi and bathroom products well covered.  Good breakfast, great staff and nice room.  A little pricey though, New York prices for a Dublin hotel.",4,2016,11,21
206,Rod Stewart weekend,"First time at Marker, came highly recommended, didn't have a very good experience
When booking I confirmed Air Conditioning to rooms, but apparently the setting was altered to winter mode so our room was just too warm and it took 5 hours to work this out and respond, room wasnt cooled down until 5am . All this for 390 Euros per night
Breakfast on both mornings was nothing short of Fawlty Towers, the food , presentation were great; the service was unbelievable. 
We gave our order for breakfast with tea and coffee and toast, but no one brought the toast,milk, butter,or  jam, and we repeatedly requested them but they just didn't arrive until everything was cold. The milk was lifted from another uncleared table. I literally heard the word apologise 50 times until I was sick of it
the manager on the morning we left again apologised and tried to give us a refund on our room but the system wouldn't allow him, he gave us our food free and said he would give me parking free but didnt. Dont think I will be back",3,2016,11,21
206,The Massages are devine!,"Oh goodness! This hotel has such a lovely spa. The staff catered to my every need! even without me mentioning a word! It's almost like they're mind readers. They even heat your slippers once your massage is complete.
The rooms were okay, nothing breathtaking and the breakfasts aren't worth anything near the price they want you to pay.
If you have booked here or are about to! definitely check out the rooftop bar and the spa! You'll have a ball ;)",4,2016,11,21
206,Mid week break,A really nice hotel with great friendly staff. Buzzing vibe in a good location. Excellent facilities on site and right next door to a lovely theatre. It is a ten minute walk to the heart of Dublin City but it is worth it. ,5,2016,11,21
206,Upselling galore!  But offers good service and comfortable accommodations,"My husband and I recently stayed three nights at The Marker Hotel in downtown Dublin.  I was attracted to The Marker Hotel by positive reviews on TripAdvisor.  For the most part, I'd say those reviews are well earned.  The Marker Hotel is a very nice place to stay.

From the moment of our arrival until the moment we left, we noticed a high level of service by friendly staff members.  The room we stayed in was a deluxe room, but that didn't impress me as much as how nice everyone was and how some staff members took the time to learn our names.

When we checked in, I noticed the receptionist was quick to suggest booking a better room and breakfast.  While I certainly understand the reason for that, I did notice that it was pretty obvious upselling.  We did end up taking her suggestions, since we were celebrating our anniversary.  Still, some travelers may find the blatant attempts to upsell somewhat irritating.  All in all, though, that was a minor thing.  

We had some problems with the elevators while we were visiting.  At one point, our keycards stopped working and we had to get them replaced.  The Marker Hotel's elevators require the use of a keycard to get to the bedrooms and it was annoying to have to seek help more than once to get the elevator to work.  However, again, that was just a minor irritation.

We ordered room service a couple of times and both times the food was delivered by a very pleasant young man named Abdullah who went out of his way to see that we had all we needed.  We also really enjoyed Kamala at breakfast, who was always smiling and cheerful and had taken the initiative to address us by name.  She was just outstanding.

I would definitely recommend The Marker Hotel.  We really enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to stay again if we're even back in Dublin.",4,2016,11,21
206,Best hotel in Dublin,"Having gone to Dublin for ten years for work this is now the best place to stay in Dublin. Been two years of outstanding service! Love everything about it! The others just cannot complete - the staff, the food, the decor, the service, the location!",5,2016,11,21
206,Quick drink ,Stopped here for a quick drink with my husband before meeting friends. Really nice spot. Was really busy just before the match and had a nice buzz. 2 really nice wines from the menu. Shiraz and pinot grigio. Didn't eat but from looking around and a quick read from the menu the food looks delish as well.  ,4,2016,11,20
206,Friendly perfection ,"We arrived tired at 8am after an early morning flight. We stopped in to the hotel to drop off bags and were delighted to discover we could check in to our rooms. The rooms are spacious, spotlessly clean and stocked with complimentary tea and Nespresso coffee .. joy! The children were also brought complimentary room service  drinks of their choice.

Following a long day sightseeing we arrived  back to find the room prepared for sleep and the bed made up for our children. 

A fantastic night sleep followed and the buffet breakfast including full Irish was amazing. 

Staff were uniformly friendly, welcoming and helpful. A credit to the general manager.  Can't fault it - will be back ! ",5,2016,11,20
206,So fab!!,"Can't recommend this hotel enough. The service was impeccable. The room was so comfy. The location is so central. The attention to detail on everything is excellent. We went for a birthday weekend, which they noted and dropped chocolates and a glass of proseco to the room!!",5,2016,11,19
206,Excellent experience,"I have been here for one night for my fiancee's birthday. The staff was excellent, professional and the spa great with its pool and warm jacuzzi. You could be there an entire day just chilling out and relaxing. Overall an excellent experience. I really recommend it.",5,2016,11,19
206,Best hotel in Dublin,"I loved this quirky hotel. The rooms were amazing. Loved the view, the space, and especially the heated floor in the bathroom. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin. It is a bit pricey, but worth every penny.",5,2016,11,18
206,Excellent,"Excellent hotel, not far away from the congress center. Excellent service and very professional staff. Nice meeting rooms some of them with natural light. Excellent food. Very nice and big rooms with all the comforts. It has also a very nice rooftop bar.",5,2016,11,17
206,One night stay,Stayed on business for one night only. Rooms are superb and come with real hairdryers (not travel ones attached to the wall). It was only a short walk into the city centre. Service in the bar was quick and friendly. ,4,2016,11,17
206,An modern urban oasis and tranquil retreat in Dublin,"On our first trip to Dublin, we wanted to stay in the heart of downtown, but all the best inner city hotels were complete booked.  That was our good luck.  We opted for the Marker Hotel on the waterfront of the Liffey River which was a brisk 20 minute walk or a quick 10 minute cab ride to Grafton Street.  

We upgraded to a corner room which was quite large and had floor to ceiling windows on two sides to enhance our view.  Our room was beautifully appointed with a comfortable king size bed draped with stitched quilts.  The living area was very modern and beautiful as was the bathroom with its cream coloured walls and Italian Carrara marble floors.  The Villeroy & Boch sinks were quite large and the elegant toiletries from Malin + Goetz adorned the marble counter tops.

Service was excellent, friendly, and the staff appeared eager to please in every respect.  My only complaint, which was a small one, is that the rooms and hallways were not well lit.  Not a problem for me, but my wife likes a brightly lit bathroom to apply makeup.

Overall I‚Äôd call this excellent hotel an urban oasis for travelers and a tranquil retreat with shops and restaurants nearby.",5,2016,11,16
206,Epic night in an excellent Hotel,"This hotel is top notch. Would highly recommend. We stayed for one night as we went to the 3 Arena for a gig. What an experience this hotel was. 10/10 Spotlessly clean, staff so so nice. Food and drinks fantastic. Amazing cocktails. Can't wait for my next stay!!",5,2016,11,16
206,Night away,Lovely hotel very clean and staff very very friendly. Roof top bar is a must on ur visit. Tea and scones in main bar are to die for. Room very clean. All in all a lovely stay in a very lovely hotel. Highly recommend ,5,2016,11,16
206,A tranquil oasis of calm with superb service and attention to even the smallest details...,"I was initially hesitant to book a hotel a little away from the downtown area and had been considering the Shelbourne or the Westin, but I'm very glad that I ended up choosing the Marker and will continue to choose the Marker for future visits. Even traveling on business, I am always very aware that female solo travelers are just a little more vulnerable and it's important for me to feel a lot of confidence that a hotel is capable of responding adeptly to assist with any issue (including anything serious) that might arise. It was immediately evident to me that Marker staff are thoughtfully hired, carefully trained, and supported by well developed internal systems so that the guest experience is one of seamlessly attentive service. From the spa treatments to the serene infinity pool and eucalyptus steam room to the beautifully appointed bedrooms (heated bathroom floors, professional quality hair dryers, plush robes, etc.) the Marker provides 360 degree excellence. I particularly appreciated the friendly breakfast room service from Paresh and Peter the barman's extensive knowledge of all things whiskey (I actually ended up with a duty free shopping list for the trip home). I never got to meet the housekeeping staff, but they deserve serious credit... the rooms were exceptionally clean from corner to corner/edge to edge (I'm one of those people who notices when little spots get missed) and the evening turn down service was so very nice to return to after a long day. The clincher was a windswept Saturday evening spent at the rooftop bar sipping red wine and watching the moon rise over Dublin. It is an exquisite memory that I will always cherish that was enabled by the Marker's attention to the details - a warming lamp, a cozy lap blanket, and hot water bottle.
",5,2016,11,16
206,Before show meal,"Spent a very pleasant afternoon here waiting to attend a show in the Bord Gas theatre. Had a most enjoyable meal . Service was very good, staff were very attentive and professional. Special mention for Yair, I hope I have spelt his name correctly. He was most helpful and courteous. I will go back again based on that visit. Well done everyone ",5,2016,11,15
206,Amazing hotel,"Stayed here for a meeting in the Dublin docks area - great location. I was given an upgrade on check in and the room was wonderful. The decor was modern and well maintained. Even though the room was located near the lift, it was very quiet and I had a great night's sleep. There was a separate shower and bath and the bathroom was very spacious. There was a good selection at breakfast and the waiting staff were very attentive. The spa looked absolutely amazing - my only complaint was that I had to attend an evening event so didn't have chance to use it!",5,2016,11,15
206,Lovely weekend break at the Marker,"Had a fantastic weekend break at The Marker Hotel. We were welcomed on arrival and shown to our room, where they had laid out a welcome treat for us. Had dinner in the Brasserie Restaurant which was just OK. My meal was fine, but the Fish dish my wife had was very bland and under-seasoned.

The music from the HQ bar next door was a bit loud, which meant we didn't get the great nights sleep we were hoping for.

The next day we had an appointment in the Spa which was excellent on every level. The pool is great and it's probably the best Jacuzzi I've ever been in.

Lovely hotel and will definitely be back.",4,2016,11,15
206,Weekend in Dublin,"I cannot fault this Hotel on anything as the service from start to finish was excellent, and I would have no hesitation in returning or recommending it to people. 
The one 'fly in the ointment' is that a glass of wine at the bar cost ‚Ç¨15.50 per Glass.",5,2016,11,15
206,Great hotel for Business,"The hotel is close to my office in Dublin. The staff is excellent. They take care of their customers very well. The fitness center is a decent size and has a nice lap pool, selection of cardio and weights, enough for the morning crowd. The room is very comfortable with a deluxe bath and separate shower. It is a very comfortable place to stay and unwind after busy work days. It is also very close to casual restaurants and has a great bar for meetings. Very professional and complete.",5,2016,11,14
206,Family break,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay in The Marker Hotel. Staff where excellent, efficient & friendly. Service was outstanding. Breakfast was lovely and again staff where very attentive.
Room was lovely. Couldn't fault it. Would definitely stay again. Location is brilliant. Within walking distance of Grafton Street and O' Connell Street. ",5,2016,11,14
206,Business trip (1 month staying),"I've been 1 month in The Marker Hotel. Very satisfied about service and facilities. The personnel is very qualified, friendly and professional.

206,Modern quiet hotel in Dublin,"Comfortable and quiet place in the Docklands area, not too far from the center of Dublin. The staff is very kind, the rooms large and well equiped. Maybe one thing is missing: a hair dryer ! 
The Brasserie proposes nice meals. ",5,2016,11,13
206,Hotel stay Review,"It will be the first hotel I will look to stay in when I am in Dublin again. I have stayed in many hotels around Ireland, UK and the US, but it's not the building and the facilities that make a 5 star hotel. It is the staff and the service. It is rare to have everyone of the staff I encountered smiling and professional at the same time. I would highly recommend The Marker Hotel to everyone.",5,2016,11,13
206,"Great location, style and service.","My wife and I just stayed for one night while nearby on business. Upgraded to corner suite with excellent view. Drinks in terrace bar ( music a little loud ) was excellent - due to weather apparently there was limited food which I thought could have been sorted - but shared platter was tasty ( might have been a bit more veg. and we got great attention from all staff. All in all super hotel and great service throughout in particular. Personally I don't like the Brasserie - bit too open and ""Restauranty"" for a top dining room / hotel so we ate out, but breakfast was excellent with attentive staff. ",5,2016,11,12

Highly highly recommend it.",5,2016,11,07
206,the marker hotel,"Stayed here last Friday 4th Nov, from the moment we set foot on the footpath outside one felt special. The doorman Steven brought us to the reception, a blonde gentleman I think his name was Robert checked us in, told us all about the hotel and walked us to the lift, to our fabulous corner suite.  
The view, the room, the facilities within the room where out of this world.....heated flooring in the bathroom, beautiful toiletries, bathrobes, slippers and a nespresso machine with pods ;-) our only regret is that we had no time enjoy the rooftop bar or Spa. Breakfast was amazing, can't wait for my next stay  ",5,2016,11,07
206,Best Hotel in Ireland,"Very thing was brilliant from check in to check out.  The team effort by the staff was exceptional: helpful, friendly, courteous, polite and going the extra mile.  Would highly recommend.  The spa and wellness facilities are out  of this world!      ",5,2016,11,07

",5,2016,11,05
206,Great for functions,Attended a business function here recently and the hotel was perfect for it. It amazes me how a hotel can prepare so many filet steaks for so many people and get it right. The room was amazing and the food perfect. This hotel is new to dublin and a great location to stay if attending a Bord Gais or 02 concert at the point. Short taxi drive in to dublin city centre,4,2016,11,05
206,Stay for business,"Easy, attentive and comfortable, I wanted to stay longer! I don't have a bad word to say. Thoroughly recommend although probably a little pricey for a longer term stay. Nice location - a 10/15 minute walk into the centre of town",5,2016,11,05

206,Futurist Hotel,"This is an excellent new hotel, with futurist design but very comfortable atmosphere.

206,Brilliant stay,"Great from start to finish. Wonderful pool and brilliant breakfast. Amazed to see pollen and honeycomb for breakfast. All the staff were friendly, polite and welcoming. Rum on the rooftop really ended each day very well indeed!",5,2016,11,02
206,Excellent pampering break,"For a special treat, this place is wonderful. Its docklands location is like a city within a city, a world away from Dublin's noise and grime. It is also the most convenient for the Grand Canal (Bord Gais) Theatre, being all of thirty yards from door to door! 
We stayed on a Friday night, the place was buzzing, but the staff were calmness personified. Can't recommend this place too highly.",5,2016,11,02
206,"Excellent hotel, excellent staff","This was our second stay, hopefully not our last, very welcoming and helpful staff, good atmosphere, exceptionally clean and quiet rooms, excellent food and rooftop bar is a great place to relax, really just a great place to stay. ",5,2016,11,02
206,Terrific,"Didn't stay overnight here but attended a dinner function recently and was very impressed, not so much by the lobby/bar design but definitely by the staff.

Thanks to Vinny who was on waiter service in the pre-function green room, his attitude and professionalism was first class.",5,2016,11,02
206,Contemporary class ,"This contemporary style hotel offers a great deal of comfort combined with distinctive class that makes for a very pleasant and luxurious stay. The location is well situated offering a scenic and panoramic view which can be observed from the terrasse bar. The upscale spa/gym facility with state-of-the-art equipment is well worth a visit for de-stressing and relaxation. Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay with friendly and outstanding service. I will happily return again if given the chance.",5,2016,11,01
206,First Class Hotel,"Great location, professional staff, beautiful, comfortable rooms.  Would definitely stay here again.  From the time we pulled in, all staff were 100% on top of their game.

206,Extremely Luxurious,"Stayed here 1 night on business, and had a great experience. The staff were very helpful, and room was spacious and very clean. There wasnt much of a view from my room (just the next door hotels windows), but the room made up for that with its quality. Great hotel.",5,2016,11,01
206,Short trip,"Absolutely fabulous hotel, lovely staff, beautiful food, amazing cocktails, short stay unfortunately but will definitely be back!!! Faultless and worth every penny! Ten out of ten!! Highly recommended!!!!",5,2016,10,31
206,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel, staff and food but the beer wasn't great. The rooftop bar is a lovely experience and the restaurant was very notice. My only complaint was that the beer (Guinness and lager) was poor.
This is an easy fix so I hope it is better the next time we visit",4,2016,10,31
206,Recommended,"Great design, friendly service, so so location. The bar and restaurant are very popular, hotel guests may not get a seat. They have a pillow menu, if you don't like the pillows in your room ask for something different.",4,2016,10,31
206,Amazing stay with an awesome staff,"Everyone was incredibly friendly and always greeted with me with smiles all around. I especially loved the heated bathroom floors, as well as the overall vibe of the hotel. The cleaning staff was also pretty stellar; I'm an incredibly messy person, and they even went to the trouble of folding all my clothes and organized all my toiletries and random papers I had lying on my extra bed. They even made sure that my laptop charger was out of the way for fear of tripping. For all of my random change and small nightstand toiletries, they put a towel underneath everything, so I know they spent extra time in my room organizing everything; makes me wish I had this kind of service at home...",5,2016,10,30
206,Visit to The Marker,"I often stay at The Marker when I visit my daughter who lives in Dublin. The rooms , the staff, the service are all excellent. The location is convenient to the city center, is safe, and has several restaurants that have become Dublin favorites. The Fresh Market that is nearby is handy for picking up a few snacks or for sandwiches. ",5,2016,10,30
206,The Hotel and Staff are first rate.  I would highly recommend this hotel to all.,"It is in a part of the city which is seeing a rehabilitation, and is out of the very busy center city, but not so far as you couldn‚Äôt walk to Center City only a 20 min walk.   The restaurants that are close by are all very good.",4,2016,10,29
206,the most impressive hotel i have ever stayed at,"I stayed here for two nights for a business trip recently. 
The room itself was beautiful, clean and well made up, the bars, brasserie etc were also top notch. 

Staff were extremely friendly, making a point of saying hello, making eye contact and even shaking you hand at times.

Only gripe was waiting in reception for the room to be ready but that was my own fault for turning uo to early! ",5,2016,10,29
206,Sophisticated ,"Whether you're downstairs in the reception bar or upstairs in the rooftop bar this is a great place to be. 

Superb cocktails and great G&T menu and very good food. Service is efficiently effortless as you'd expect from a hotel such as this. 

Impress on date night or just chill with friends, you can't go wrong. ",4,2016,10,28
206,Just the job,Spent afternoon with biz colleagues and I have to say the service was brilliant. Staff really helpful and attentive. Looking forward to my Bec meeting on the hotel. Would highly recommend for all levels of business,5,2016,10,28
206,Best hotel in Dublin.,"Best hotel in Dublin by far. Stayed here for a week on business in October 2016 and loved it. Prime location for all of the tech companies, fantastic service, facilities and overall a great place to stay. The pool, gym and spa in particularly are really worth a visit. Special mention must go to the staff who really do go the extra mile to make you feel welcome and looked after at every opportunity. Everyone I encountered was incredibly helpful and always with a smile on their face.",5,2016,10,27
206,Beautiful hotel in a cool part of Dublin,Great hotel. Very new and room man are fantastic. Bath and shower really good. The spa and pool area is amazing-  definitely find time to go. Everyone so helpful it makes for a great stay.  I would highly recommend to any business person or anyone travelling with family or just generally on holiday ,5,2016,10,27
206,Return visit,"This is the second visit to this hotel. The staff are unbelievably courteous and beyond willing to assist. Top hatted doorman welcome you and then the journey begins. A very modern open plan space. I was given a free upgrade to an even more luxurious room. At breakfast the staff insisted that she change our tea for a fresh pot ...our cups and napkins replaced at any chance. Quite superb attention to detail. Whilst enjoying a cheeky cheese and biscuits with a glass of wine (waiting for a taxi to airport) the staff suggested some honey to accompany it...again, it's all about personal service. We had a massage in the Spa and this was without doubt, the very best I've ever had. Roll on the return visit.",5,2016,10,27
206,Great hotel in a nice location,"Booked for a short weekend break - a 20min walk into the madness of Dublin centre but in a nice new chilled area with a good selection of bars and restaurants on the doorstep. Excellent hotel and staff, room was also excellent with a great view of the waterfront, theatre and restaurants.",5,2016,10,26
206,Confusion,"Arrived to the hotel and was placed in a standard room which I hadn't booked, then to be told the room I had booked wasn't available. But still paid the higher rate for the room I had booked. I don't think I will be back in a hurry.",3,2016,10,26
206,fantastic hotel when attending meetings at Dublin Conference Center,"Booked here for a conference in Dublin.  Amazing hotel very close to the Dublin Conference Center.  Amazing hotel with very friendly and helpful staff - did all the 'little things' well to make the stay extremely enjoyable.  Enjoyed drinks on both the rooftop bar (amazing view, albeit a bit chilly once the sun went down - but they brought blankets out for everyone) and the lobby bar - both were excellent.  Fantastic breakfast in the morning as part of the room.",5,2016,10,25
206,"Glamorous, luxurious & fun","The Marker is a beautiful hotel, set in the picturesque Grand Canal Square next to the Bord Gais Energy Theatre and various restaurants and bars.  The room we stayed in (Deluxe Double) was spacious, comfortable, pristine and looked out onto the square described. The staff are without question incredibly friendly, helpful and great people. Definitely get yourself up to the rooftop bar if it's open - fantastic view and lively atmosphere - which we found all across the hotel. A definite must-stay in Dublin if your budget stretches - it is very expensive but for a pampering weekend (we didn't even get a chance to check out the spa), I would say splash out and book it. (Don't miss out on brunch at Herbstreet just two doors down - amazing food to be sure :-)",5,2016,10,25
206,"Great Hotel, great Staff","The Marker is a great hotel. facilities are excellent, staff is very friendly and helpfull.
Rooms a great, well sized and bed are excellent! Swimming pool and Spa facilities meet the highest standards. 
definately worth staying!",5,2016,10,25
206,Grand opening to holiday for two weeks in Ireland,"Fron the time you arrive you are greeted with a very friendly warm welcome form the bellman to front desk staff. All are very knowledgeable in giving suggestions to various site to be seen ""The Book of Kells"" and how to best use transportation in Dublin. Hotel is located across from civic center, public transportation very handy, Breakfast is a delight, food excellent and healthy with prompt service, at no time did you wait for bar or dining service, a very enjoyable experience.",5,2016,10,24
206,The bathroom is as big as my dining room,"This is a gorgeous, incredibly well-appointed hotel with outstanding service. The attention to details is outstanding. And the bathroom! The bathtub is a full, lie down tub in a huge bathroom with separate shower and heated floors. I was there on business but I would have been happy to stay in the room for the whole week. Easily the best hotel I stayed in for the price. My breakfast was included and the buffer was superb. So many choices depending on your mood. I had smoked salmon (which was a little extra) and poached eggs every morning. ",5,2016,10,24
206,"Hotel 5 stars, Brasserie not","The hotel is everything I think you want in a 5 star hotel.  All the staff are very well trained and attentive.  The rooms are large, well-furnished, and quite comfortable.  Complimentary shoe-shine, all of it.

The Brasserie, by comparison, is a disappointment.  The breakfast simply isn't worth half what they charge.",5,2016,10,24
206,Location is great but I miss the five stars,"- Location is definitely great at the water
- Prices are expensive, 300+ Euro
- Checkin took some time, was also very ""laid back"" and not too professionally.
- Spa was a big plus, even though it closes at 9pm which is a way too early also for the gmy
- Disappointed by the breakfast, 24 Euros for a breakfast with no real fresh juice, if you come at 930 the salad bar is almost empty, I ordered! fresh eggs and still got the one from the buffet in the end, not a lot cheese or bread selection, definitely not worth it its money.
- In general a good hotel but no five stars.",3,2016,10,23
206,Very nice stay,"Heard great reviews from colleagues, I stayed with my family in September and I must say WOW, from the entrance to the foyer an the bedrooms great style and decor, the Front desk were very welcoming and all questions were answered, will highly recomend",5,2016,10,23
206,"The service is 5*, the food is not ","The staff at The Marker deliver excellent customer service, from the minute you park your car at the set down area, to check out, the service is really good. Every staff member is polite and professional. Karina at breakfast was excellent, and the young doorman with the beard, I didn't get his name, deserve a special mention. The anniversary plate and prosecco in the room were a lovely touch and the staff also acknowledged the anniversary during dinner. The room was nice, spacious, a comfortable bed and a really nice bathroom. The food unfortunately did not match the amazing staff. While dinner was nice, it was not 5*, the portions were very small, even for fine dining and lacked flavour, the dessert was the stand out course of the meal. Breakfast was just ok, nothing special. Overall, this a nice modern hotel and the staff make it memorable. ",4,2016,10,23
206,Great attention and service,"Wonderful corner suite - very quiet. Comfortable bed. Small thought out details with the design made for a comfortable stay. Ample breakfast buffet, great service and very comfortable (although I'd suggest softer background music). ",5,2016,10,23
206,Stunning architecture modern hotel in the financial district,"The outside and inside of this hotel are stunning modern architecture - as you walk in it's like being inside a white beehive.  The rooms are beautifully appointed with every modern facility.  The downstairs bar has a great range of whiskey's and attentive staff - there's also a rooftop bar with outstanding views.  We were there for a business meeting and the room, AV equipment and service were some of the finest I've experienced.",4,2016,10,23
206,"Great hotel, breakfast could be better","Great hotel, breakfast could be better  since the selection of products was a little bit poor. The hotel is beautiful and the location is perfect so i would recommend it again. Staff friendly and attentive and we had great views of the water . ",4,2016,10,23
206,Be careful the price of breakfast,Make sure u check the price when breakfast is not included in your booking. Our booking is without breakfast but no one told us and give us the menu which charged a separate price if this is the case. Feel ripped off as we gotta paid whatever they said ,3,2016,10,23
206,Ideally located for visiting tech companies,"The Marker Hotel is located next to Facebook, and 5 minutes walking from Google's HQ. Rooms are completely new, the bed is really comfortable, and the bathroom is very spacious (and even features underfloor heating with different temperatures). The cheapest way to get to the hotel is by taking the sightseeing tourist bus from the city centre and get of at the Clayton Hotel (the Marker Hotel is located in front).",5,2016,10,22
206,New great hotel in Dublin's new canal area,"I give The Marker full marks. There was nothing out of place. Great rooms, great spa, great swimming pool, great toiletries... But what really sold me was the Impeccable service. Everyone I interacted with was effortlessly thoughtful, warm, and elegant. I do not have any special tip to provide because the staff took care of anything that could go wrong--or did not allow me to even notice.",5,2016,10,22
206,The Marker Hotel,Fantastic hotel centrally located in Dublin Ireland. Very nice upper scale location. I was staying while on business in Ireland. Rooms were very nice. Large room with a very nice view. Shops are just located directly across from the hotel. Large shower. ,5,2016,10,21
206,Exceptional Staff make this hotel 5* plus!!!,"Enjoyed a fantastic stay at The Marker hotel, Dublin! Location great, breakfast great, pool great- relaxing and serene, rooms fabulous, views brilliant, overall decor classy but most of all- the staff are what makes this hotel exceptional! Every single member of staff we interacted with were fantastic- down to earth but brilliantly professional, extra touches such as sweets in the room (wonderfully presented) for the child in our company and an accompanied visit to the rooftop bar, even though it was closed when we were there, made our visit all the more special and we felt truly welcomed! Every member of staff was sincere, courteous and respectful in every manner and we most certainly will keep singing their praises! Looking forward to staying again in the near future!",5,2016,10,21
206,"Great hotel, location and service","Service was great and staff was friendly. Room cozy and spacious. No issues at all, recommend the place! It's right by the water and just a quick jaunt to the busier parts of the city. Great for business trips or more relaxing stays.",5,2016,10,21
206,Quiet waterfront and business hotel,Good location with friendly service . There is a rooftop bar with simple snacks that has a good view of the area at the waterfront. Good Restaurants at a walking distance - 20 minutes to 30 minutes most. Nice rooms with comfortable beds. ,4,2016,10,20
206,Best hotel in Dublin,I stayed four nights for work and it was easily the best hotel I've stayed In during any of my trips to Dublin (four). It was booked for me as it's next to my office but all my colleagues commented that it was the best in Dublin and the hotel that Messi had stayed in a few weeks earlier. The room service food was very nice and the wifi was fast enough for me to stream football. The gym is limited but has a bench and a few weights. I had hoped to visit the roof bar but it had been privately hired for three of the days (apparently that's common there) and it rained on the forth day (also common),5,2016,10,19
206,Well earned us time,"My fab wife booked this hotel as a surprise birthday treat for a weekend away for just the two of us, it did not disappoint. 
The service is impeccable, from check in to check out.
The rooms are modern and spacious with the bathroom was huge, even underfloor heated.
Probably the best breakfast we've ever had, we also had an evening meal on the first night which was excellent. 
The pool and spar is really classy.
But the best bit is the roof top bar over looking the river and Dublin, that's great, and the concierge at the roof bar entrance who looks after everyone  is a credit to the hotel,(thanks for looking after us Dereck).
It may be a bit pricey but for a treat, worth every penny, we'll definitely return.
They even posted my Kindle back to me as I had left in the room!

",5,2016,10,19

206,The last word,"Very striking hotel, interior and exterior, close to Dublin city centre.  Warm  and helpful staff, check in was quick and valet parking a special treat.. We had a lovely room on the sixth floor overlooking the bay. The bed was very comfortable and the room was big spacious and bright.

206,WOW - 6 star hotel,"The hotel was fabulous, heated flooring in the bathroom, could have slept there, however, you would not want to miss the excellent beds!  What a treat this place was and the staff were incredible!  Meals were pricey, but just steps away from 5 delightful cafes, 4 of which we treated ourselves to for breakfasts, lunch, and dinner.  Not a block to catch the Hop-on-hop off tour bus.",5,2016,10,17
206,Perfect city centre retreat,"I was in Dublin on business but brought my family. From the moment I pulled up in my car till the point we checked out, the service and attention to detail was just top notch.

Bathroom was great size, though minor gripe was that the shower temperature jumped up and down. The staff are great, courteous and professional. I used the valet parking, which although I thought expensive was worth it, nice little touch was the bottles of water left in the car. Overall it was a good stay, perfect location for visit to Bord Gais theatre. I would definitely go back and next time will hopefully use the spa.",4,2016,10,15

206,5 Stars (for real),"Wow, this place really is doing EVERYTHING right. I attended to entertain at a conference and the conference team couldn't do enough to help me to ensure my presentation went well.
Every single member of staff is courteous without being smarmy. The rooms are luxurious and the food in the bar is excellent.
The staff really couldn't do enough for you. The breakfast is excellent.
I really could go on. I haven't posted a review for a while but this really needed to be said.",5,2016,10,14

206,Stunning modern hotel,The Marker is a stunning hotel in Dublin's city centre.   The hotels rooms are beautiful and spacious.

206,Stylish hotel with friendly atmosphere and great price-performance ratio,"We have been travelling with a group of 19 people and had a great support in terms of booking and handling different issues. The location is absolutely overwheamling starting in the stylish looby, over the rooms up to the rooftop bar with a 360¬∞ view over Dublin. We enjoyed all the accomodations as well as the extraordinary friendly staff. Additionally placed beside Waters, The Marker Hotel is the absolute winner in terms of a young, dynamic and modern atmosphere.",5,2016,10,11
206,Modern hotel in modern district furher from center,"Average modern hotel in modern district , with spacious rooms with nice view on water canal . Very good spa with big pool and saunas .

206,Fantastic experience,Best Hotel in Dublin. This should be listed as a 6 star hotel excellent staff and service. The attention to customer satisfaction is outstanding. If only all hotels could take this model of managing and use it in thier hotels.   Well done The Marker,5,2016,10,11
206,An amazing stay‚Ä¶,"We stayed at The Marker for part of my wife's 40th birthday celebrations and we were not disappointed! It was a perfect long weekend at the perfect hotel! Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff at the hotel, especially the Concierge. Everyone is so polite and interested in talking to you and hearing your plans for the day, offering helpful advice to better your plans and maximise your stay and enjoyment! I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to everyone and we will definitely be back! Thank you The Marker!",5,2016,10,11
206,"Fine hotel, but maybe not the best for a family stay","We went to Dublin for a long weekend with the kids. We had chosen this hotel marginally out of the absolute centre of Dublin, attracted by the facilities of the hotel including a pool for the kids and not least a rooftop bar for the parents, in the event that the opportunity to go there occurred.
Arriving at the hotel worked fine - we were checked into our room swiftly and the pre-reserved dinner at the brasserie was fine although it is a bit chilly to dine in the lobby. So all fine and good. The following days we spend the mornings in the pool at the mezzanine floor. Or that is: the first days was fine but the second day we were told to be quiet by the staff, since a woman wanted to be able to sit quietly and read  a book in the pool area. We were a bit surprised to hear this since the pool had specific hours where kids were allowed to go, which we adhered to. And of course our kids are noisy, as any kids, but I would argue not out of the ordinary. It did not help much when we the following day were told by the staff  that the hotel did not ""recommend"" that the kids used the sauna and steam bath, which made our kids feel that they for the second day in a row were doing something wrong.
Apart from this incident we had a good stay at the hotel. It is a nice and modern hotel with a friendly staff. We didn't go to the rooftop bar since it was closed due to the cold Autumn weather which was fine.
Will we come back to the Marker? Maybe, but it will not be as a family since the hotel seems to be mainly for couples and business travellers.",4,2016,10,10
206,"The Marker Hotel, Dublin","This is the second time I have stayed at the Marker Hotel.  Once again excellent hotel, great location, great atmosphere and friendly, helpful and apprroable staff.  I am looking forward to my third visit ",5,2016,10,10
206,Classy hotel,"Top quality hotel. The staff are pleasant, the spa and swimming pool were a really nice treat after a long day of walking. Not cheap, but worth it if you want to treat yourself. The breakfast was included and pretty decent.",5,2016,10,09
206,"Very enjoyable, albeit short, stay. Would have liked to have stayed longer.","Pretty much a perfect experience; from the clean and comfortable room (best night's sleep I have had in an hotel for many a year - at last, someone seems to have cracked the air-conditioning challenge of not too hot/cold or noisy) to the food and very friendly staff - with whom I shared some entertaining and informative conversations. They came across as genuinely proud to be working at the hotel.",5,2016,10,09
206,Wonderful stay,"My wife and I stayed here for one night in July, we were very lucky to get a seat in the rooftop bar and we didn't want to leave. 
Fantastic staff, friendly efficient and helpful at all times. 
The breakfast was a wonderful arrangement for the continental buffet and the cooked breakfast had a great selection too, the highlight of breakfast was the Cronouts unbelievable! 
When our car was brought to the front of the hotel the 2 used coffee cups that were in it on arrival were gone and in their place was 2 bottles of water! It capped off an amazing night and we cannot wait to return. ",5,2016,10,09
206,Outstanding attention!!,"I stayed for 7 nights at this superb hotel in Dublin, maybe one of the finest I've ever been in Europe.
Hotel's staff is amazingly courteous and always willing to help, and one step forward to guest's needs.
Rooms service is perfect; quick, great quality, and room service attention couldn't be better.
And, to be honest, I think some people deserve a special mention: room maids are, by far, the most kind, respectful, properly trained and extremely polite. I've experienced something similar just in Taiwan @ The Hilton.
Another special mention to the Manager in charge that solved some issue I have with a couple of improperly ironed t-shirts; she sorted the problem professionally and within 20 minutes.
Everything is like this @ The Marker; the only thing is I wish I would have stayed in a bigger room than my #504 and that you could open the window, but that exceeds staff's responsibility...
I would improve the breakfast in assortment, but as I've said, waiters are very kind too.
Rather expensive, but that's another story; really cope with my expectations. 
Dublin is a really tourist friendly city, people is beautiful in the broad sense of the word!",5,2016,10,08
206,Very nice hotel (only with Air Conditioning problem),"Extremely happy except being frozen.. The hotel staff tried to solve the AC blowing cold weather, but it was not resolved during my stay. Other than this, hotel staff was extremely helpful andeverything was almost perfect",4,2016,10,08
206,Business trip,"The Marker hotel has amazing rooms, great room service (even if choice is not very varied), very clean, breakfast has a lot of choice and the food is of great quality.
The meeting room facilities and the service that goes with it has a lot to improve, a lot of people coming in corridors phoning which disturbed the ongoing meeting, wrong number of chairs provided, crisped table cloth, slow facilities to scan etc.",3,2016,10,07
206,A 5 star gem,"Everything about the stay was fantastic from start to finish. Staff were friendly and professional and the facilities excellent. I worked 3 years front of house in a hotel so I understand it's all about the details. Well done everyone, it really is a fantastic hotel in every way.
If you're thinking of staying here, do it! Would love to go back, missing the infinity pool, sauna and steamroom already. 
Disregard any negative reviews (if there is any) some people are never happy and you can usually tell they're chumps due to the poorly written reviews. I actually find them quite amusing. 
Keep up the good work and hopefully see you again in the not too distant future. ",5,2016,10,07
206,Gorgeous hotel and friendly staff,Both times I have stayed at this hotel the facility and staff were wonderful.  This second trip I even have a personal note and fruit thanking me for my stay.  Very convenient to the financial area as well as tourist attractions. ,5,2016,10,07
206,Friendly and clean.,Our plane arrived at 8am Ireland time.  Our hotel check-in was not until 3 pm.  Arrived at The Marker at 9 am.  Checked in and room was Already  available for us.  This was amazing for us.  The room was very clean and very nice.  I would stay again.,5,2016,10,06
206,"Business trip to Dublin, excellent place to stay","Although I only spent one night in Dublin, the Markers hotel certainly added to my enjoyment of the city. The staff were extremely polite and helpful, the room was spacious and with good facilities and the food and bar areas are particularly impressive. Well worth considering for business or pleasure.",5,2016,10,06
206,Pure luxury,"Start to finish and wonderfully flawless experience. Will stay again. 
We enjoyed the spa, treatments, the room and bar. Great setting on the quay and easily accessed. Superbly attentive staff throughout the hotel. Couldn't fault it. ",5,2016,10,06
206,Good Location,"Hotel is in a great location, good views but close enough to the city to have fun. We had one of the suites,  expensive but worth it. Food was good, overall service was good, loud bar and restaurant  both a little impersonal ok for a business trip but not for intimate meal or drink. ",4,2016,10,05
206,Great and modern Business Hotel,"I spent a night at the Marker in June. This is a nice and very modern business Hotel. Sleek and large rooms, good location in the business district. Nice indoor Pool. Ideal for guests doing business in the area or for tourists visiting Dublin. (Only a few minutes from Temple Bar Street by Taxi).",4,2016,10,05
206,Nearly 5 star,Smart and shiny but the rooms are spartan with inadequate wardrobe space and no drawers. Clothes stacked on floor. Wish I had stayed in a 4 star nearby with more room. Food and service excellent but only 1 restaurant and closed on Mondays!! Dark ages!!,4,2016,10,05
206,Always good to be back,"The Marker is a very modern hotel with exzellent service. No matter if you are there for business or pleasure, you have all the options.

the rooms and facilities are superb  - you don't have to worry about anything",5,2016,10,05
206,Excellent hotel ,"We never stayed at this hotel but we visited  the rooftop bar on our short trip to Dublin. As we weren't residents it took us some time to get up to the rooftop . Although the door man (Derek) who stood by the lift was extremely pleasant and helpful and treated us very nice. When we got up there we ordered some nice cocktails and also some small food items (the tempura was amazing )  , our waitress was very friendly (Nicole) and always had a smile on her face she  recommended  a lemon cocktail and it was outstanding one of the nicest I've had in any place. So thank you to all the staff and the bar man who made this it was amazing ! We will be sure to stay here the next time we come to Dublin. From what we saw on our short time at the marker we give it five stars it deserves!! ",5,2016,10,04
206,Beautiful hotel,"Had a beautiful stay in the marker hotel ..the staff were vey pleasant and helpfull in every way excellent service would diffently stay here again room was nicely decorated and the breakfast the next morning was very tasty.

",5,2016,10,04
206,Highly recommend The Marker,"Wife and I stayed at The Marker for four nights total at either end of a trip elsewhere in Europe.  We really enjoyed our stay at The Marker.  The service was excellent and friendly and the rooms were very clean and comfortable.  In fact, the sleep conditions were excellent - comfortable beds, very quiet rooms.  
Special mention to the restaurant manager (Godfrey) and the front desk manager (I believe her name was Hani) for saving us on our first night there by getting us some much-needed food right before the kitchen closed after my wife and I overslept during a nap after an significantly-delayed overnight flight from the States.  The concierge, the bellman, and the doorman were all great as well, giving us directions, restaurant recommendations, and taxis as needed.  We would absolutely stay at The Marker again and will recommend it to our family and friends as well.",5,2016,10,04
206,Weekend und Dublin,"We had a wonderful time in The Marker. The staff was fantastic, very polite and attentive. always helpful and courteous. We will come back in any case. The view from the rooftop bar is wonderful and we enjoyed our drinks there.",5,2016,10,04
206,Excellent,Everything from check-in until check-out was perfect. Thank you for making this trip unforgettable. I especially loved the breakfast buffet. Everything was fresh and delicious. I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone. ,5,2016,10,04
206,Over Rated!!!,"Stayed here last week as a treat!!
We were visiting Dublin for  couple days so we decided we would treat ourselves and stay at the 5 star marker hotel.

Checked in at 2pm room was ready etc.
Room was def not a 5 star standard more like a good 4 star.

Went to the bar for food that night.
Not very many options on the menu so we decided not to stay in the hotel but to venture out in Dublin.

We came across a beautiful restaurant called Dax will do separate review on this.
Breakfast the next morning was the best part beautiful fresh fry up!!!

Carpark was ‚Ç¨20.00 per night what a rip off!!!

Wont visit again very overrated",3,2016,10,04
206,Always worth returning,"I stayed here over the weekend. Staff were excellent and the bar was good. 
There's a great selection of drinks to choose from too. Rooms are big and very well sound-insulated. Pool area was also great.",5,2016,10,04
206,Top Class,Couldn't fault this hotel. I'm a tough customer to please and I've rarely come across such a professional and well trained staff. the facility is fantastic and the service makes it the best in Dublin.,5,2016,10,04
206,Good business hotel,"The hotel is good if you have business around that area.  For tourism, it might be a bit further from the main attractions - easy 20-30 min walk.  There are some pubs especially The Ferryman about 2 blocks away (no food- just drinks).

I find that the aircon vents are placed very badly- right on the ceiling on top of the beds'.  I had to sleep aside on the bed to avoid taking in the air from the vents all night.  ",4,2016,10,03
206,"Very Comfortable, Modern Hotel","Very nice, modern hotel in a very convenient location, within close walking distance to downtown, shopping & pubs. 
Nice clean room and very chique bathrooms. 
Bar area was very nice. Buffet presentation at breakfast looked great although I would only rate the food as average. ",5,2016,10,03
206,Nice hotel,"The hotel staff are exceptional. The rooms are OK.
What I found odd is that the hallway to the guest rooms were extremely dim. The guest rooms are well appointed but are getting dated especially in the bathrooms. Grout needs redone.",4,2016,10,03
206,Awesome Hotel,Experienced great service. The rooms are amazing as are the bathrooms. It's a little far from Dublin downtown but the Docklands area is great and offers great restaurants. Planning to stay at The Marker Hotel again,5,2016,10,03
206,An impressive hotel with excellent service,"The Marker Hotel was extremely impressive, in terms of the hotel, its facilities plus its very professional and helpful staff. Definitely the place to consider for a premium-level stay in Dublin - I would recommend this hotel to others and will certainly be back myself.",5,2016,10,03
206,very friendly staff and proper hotrel,"very nice hotel indeed. modern yet warm. very friendly staff, good beds, good shower, very good breakfast. Location is OK. about a 20 min walk from the city center. Rooftop bar is a suprise and very nice indeed.
",4,2016,10,03
206,The best ,"Beautiful hotel, staff so friendly! If you stay worth a trip up to the top to the rooftop bar and restaurant, amazing food and wine! Service excellent couldn't fault it. The spa was gorgeous we didn't have time for a treatment but the pool and facilities were excellent I'll definitely be back! ",5,2016,10,02
206,Glorious ,"We had one night here as we were leaving Dublin and were so very happy with our choice.  It's a little out of the centre but the Docklands area is a renewal project and offers great restaurants and activities.  It's about a 20 minute walk into town.  The hotel itself lives up to the rating online.  Before we arrived we were offered an upgrade to a corner suite for 100 Euro (which I am glad we took). The room was huge and comfortable, the bed sumptuous (best nights sleep in Ireland) - it was quiet and the entertainment system was excellent.  Breakfast was also best of the whole trip a tasty and uber fresh.  Not planning on coming back to Ireland for a whole but if we were we'd spend a bit more time in The Marker.",5,2016,10,02
206,Holiday,"Lovely hotel perfect getaway.

Very clean hotel, the restaurant food is nice.  Dublin is really interesting and has so much history, the people are very friendly, we are planning to return and stay at The Marker Hotel again",5,2016,10,02
206,Modernity with traditional hospitality,"Quite a surprise in a city of fine historic and traditional hotels.  Its Modernity is applaudable and the Brasserie (despite a mundane name) is already among the best restaurants in Ireland. Friendliness in all the right ways, knowledgeable people, quick to react to requests. 
",5,2016,10,02
206,Fantastic Stay,I visited here with my sister and Mam as a spa treat for a night in Dublin. One of the best hotels I've stayed in. Not too snooty and very well done. The spa is lovely. The hotel upgraded us to a suite as they made a mistake with our booking- which was great and the staff couldn't do more for you. We are in the restaurant and food was great. I'd definitely go back. It's not a cheap hotel but there is value for money. ,5,2016,10,02
206,One of the best,"The Marker is one of the finest hotels in any city that would be experienced for ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨. In Dublin there are only a handful that could compare. It is pricey, but with the current overpricing in the Dublin market, it is worth it. The staff are excellent, the rooms are modern, spacious and comfortable. The location is excellent with all amenities close by. A great choice for any traveller.",5,2016,10,01
206,the best,"The best there is, you can not ask for better, great service every aspect is covered, even if we look for ""flaws"" can not be found, great staff, perfect breakfast, all smiling and want to help in every way possible",5,2016,10,01
206,"A1 perfect stay, faultless","Perfect place to be in Dublin, close to airport and in a newly regenerated area that is buzzy but quiet at night. Hotel was everything you'd want - food was great and the breakfasts were the best I've had in a hotel. Healthy stuff (bee pollen, chia seeds, etc!) and also the fun stuff (great bacon and sausages). The gym and pool were top class, as were the rooms and, this being Dublin, the people running it were really friendly as well as knowing exactly what they were doing. Wouldn't change a thing and had a great stay, and I'm really fussy.",5,2016,10,01
206,I'll be back!,"The Marker has to be one of Dublin's finest hotels. From the moment you arrive the staff are there to help, the rooms are beyond description, modern luxury at it's best. While it is a new part of the city, it is still close to St Stephens Green, the Aviva and Dublin's main attractions. I would recommend it for any traveler for any purpose. ",5,2016,10,01
206,The Marker - Chic hotel,This hotel is very chic and modern.  It is off the beaten path but all attractions are within walking distance.  Perfect for business travel as well.  The Spa and all of it's employees were wonderful.  I would highly recommend it.,5,2016,09,29
206,A wonderful experience,"My corporate travel was booked with The Marker Hotel. For service, amenities and presentation of the hotel I highly recommend this hotel. I travel often globally and I can tell you that the Marker is of the highest quality. The staff and management were attentive and friendly.",5,2016,09,29
206,Trip 24/09/16,"We stayed in the marker last Sat an couldnt fault it for friendliness and helpfulness.We got an upgrade but also saw the suite we had booked as our friends were in the same and bth the upgrade and original were spotless,luxurious and the attention to detail is spot on.Staff were unbelievable although the bar service was a little slow it was so relaxing we didnt mind.Worth every penny.",5,2016,09,28
206,Top marks for The Marker,"Experienced great service from the moment my new wife and I arrived to the moment we left the hotel. Room was delightful, food was of such a high quality and would highly recommend the sharing platter for two at the bar washed down with one of their signature cocktails. The spa facilities are great, they include a swimming pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi. Hotels location is perfect if you are looking somewhere close to the heart of Dublin. ",5,2016,09,28
206,"Almost perfect, but concierge was always missing","This was our first stay at The Marker and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  They upgraded our room because we arrived early and our original room was not ready for check in.  The room was spectacular - complete with a bottle of champagne upon arrival!  The staff was incredibly friendly and the hotel is in a lovely part of town - easily walkable to all of the standard Dublin attractions.  The only problem was with the concierge, who was never at his desk when we walked by.  Literally never, over the course of a three night stay.  At one point we actually wanted to speak with him, so we inquired at the front desk.  Someone assistance us in his absence, but told us inaccurate information (we wanted to do the hop on, hop off tour bus, but the front desk attendee told us the bus drivers were on strike -- after jumping into a taxi to get where we wanted to go, we proceeded to see the tour buses all over town all day).  The service in the bar and brasserie was also quite slow, but we were on holiday and didn't really mind all that much.  Otherwise a wonderful stay -- and we will be back.",4,2016,09,28
206,An oasis of true 5STAR service in Dublin,"in a word EXCEPTIONAL... From the moment we arrived and were greeted by Eugeney the Door man , who was at all times the consummate professional, to our departure, this was a thouroughly enjoyable experience. I will definately return to the MARKER and can withouth any hesitation highly reccomend it to anyone wishing to experience Dublin hospitality at its best",5,2016,09,27

206,Awesome Hotel in the business area,"The hotel was really nice, and it's located really close to where I need to be. The room has nice view. A lot of restaurants nearby, in addition to the ones in the hotel. They can improve on the room service's food selection though.",5,2016,09,27
206,Full marks to The Marker,Having stayed overnight as a birthday present from our children we were not disappointed. We were met like royalty and made feel very welcome in check in and were personally escorted to our room. The rooms are amazing as are the bathrooms. We had lunch in the bar which was delicious and caters for all pallets paleo vegan etc. Unfortunately we didn't get to see the rooftop bar as it was full. Certainly The Marker has the best breakfast in Dublin. Amazing buffet with lots to order to your liking. Real honeycomb and amazing natural yoghurts with additives like chia seeds and even bee pollen. On checkout you can grab yourself a takeaway coffee for journey home. All the little touches made this a night to remember. Honestly I can't wait to revisit The Marker Hotel. A real 5 star hotel for sure ,5,2016,09,27
206,"Rooms great, bar and food service very slow",Overall The Marker was great for accommodations.  I was here on business in the docks area and it was a very quick walk to anywhere east of Trinity College. The rooms were very comfortable and the check in process was quick.  Service in the bar tends to be quite slow and not attentive. Twice I needed to walk to the bar from my table to either request something that was forgotten by the server or to close my tab.  ,4,2016,09,26
206,Ever so friendly,"Wonderful Hotel and excellent staff. 
Rooms are large and elegant, lighting could be a little more...
Everybody was really friendly, the only point is that the Roof top terrace closed too early in the evening.
",5,2016,09,26
206,5*,"Excellent location , rooms spacious clean and luxurious bed.
Food excellent .
Service very good, car parking in Q park nearby . Would recommend this hotel for business or short theatre stays. Busy foyer and bar with lots of local employees on a Friday.",5,2016,09,26
206,Luxury in the Dock!,"Stayed overnight ahead of a conference I was attending. Liked every aspect of the hotel with the possible exception of the dark corridors and low lighting. Room was clean and had very nice amenities. WiFi worked well, food was very good. The most outstanding aspect of my stay was the level of staff enthusiasm and friendliness. It was exceptional. A very good option if you are visiting Dublin!",4,2016,09,25
206,Super hotel - must be after almost 20 visits!,"Stayed at The Marker just after it opened having stayed at a number of other hotels in Dublin. Not stayed anywhere else since. After 4+ years its quality, standard and service have remained constant. I like a no fuss, practical efficient hotel which has a high standard of delivery. Think modern equivalent of Ritz Carlton on Central Park, NY and you're there. Super breakfasts and gorgeous oysters for dinner. Highly recommended.",5,2016,09,24
206,Roof terrace closed !!,"We booked the hotel based on the added attraction of a roof terrace. On arrival at check in we tried to book our evening meal for the roof terrace only to be told it was closed each monday and tuesday because the hotel was ""quiet"". I wonder if they are considering closing the residents bar as well ? ",4,2016,09,23
206,Lovely Hotel,"A super hotel with brilliant rooms. Very friendly welcoming staff ,fabulous rooms & rooftop The location bar. Lovely view from or bedroom ! A great place to spend our last few nights on our Irish trip.",5,2016,09,23
206,10/10 fantastic stay,"Everything was perfect, we had a cosy upgraded room overlooking the front of the hotel and the spa was so quiet and relaxing, we had delicious cocktails on the stunning roof top bar and a fabulous breakfast delivered to the room on Sunday morning. 

A special mention to Jonathon on reception who checked us in and Derek in the roof top bar who really made the stay special. Nothing was too much trouble! All the staff gave exceptional customer service and I would definitely recommend the hotel to family and friends.",5,2016,09,23
206,Surprise birthday dinner and weekend stay flawless !,This hotel certainly stands out from the crowd. what a real gem of a place. We went to the 3 arena and then stayed here on my birthday as a surprise and they had the bed all done up for us on arrival and also sang happy birthday and the chefs sent out a small cake with a candle. rooms are very comfortable and the deco very impressive.,5,2016,09,23
206,I'd give 6 stars if I could,"Before I checked out, I was already planning on giving this hotel 5 stars. I travel a lot for business and pleasure, and I felt like this hotel was very high on almost every factor of consideration. 

The check-in service was the friendliest and most helpful that I've ever encountered. From there, I was seriously impressed with the interior decor and design, and found the room to be comfortable and modernly luxurious. 

The bar had a good feel and made excellent cocktails. 

The service throughout the hotel was lightning fast and exceptionally courteous. 

What really makes me gush about this place though, is what happened when I arrived at the airport to leave the country and realized that I didn't have my passport. After phoning the hotel, the staff quickly expedited a search of my room, recovered the passport, sent it via taxi (the driver made record time) to the airport, and enabled me to board my plane in time. This went from being a massively stressful experience to a marvelous one. 

I have to give credit as well to ""team Ireland"" on this one. From the airport staff to the taxi driver, everyone went out of their way to help me. Thanks so much!! <3 !!",5,2016,09,23
206,Great Stay,"Stayed here for three nights at the end of August. Wonderful, helpful staff. Beautiful room overlooking the Grand Canal. Barry, the concierge was particularly helpful in arranging a rental car for us. Luckily we had the perfect weather to enjoy the rooftop bar. Nice breakfast each morning. We ate in the Brasserie once. Food was excellent but the floor management of the restaurant was disappointing and unwelcoming.",5,2016,09,23
206,Fabulous hotel,A perfect hotel with excellent staff . It is a real five*hotel. The rooftop bar is also excellent as well as the food in the brasserie. Near to the centre but very peaceful. I will certainly come back.,5,2016,09,22
206,Nice hotel but overpriced,"Nice hotel but not close to shopping. It was a 20 minute walk. Also overpriced for
value. Had a problem with the shower and also was charged 57 Euros for the minibar which I 
didn't use. The charge was removed. The service was really great at the hotel and the room very nice.",3,2016,09,22
206,"Great service , facilities","Fantastic hotel, good location , great food. Great service. Spa and roof top amazing. Will stay again next time I'm over. Special mention to Leon at front door and reception people. Breakfast had great variety and the rooftop great views of the city",5,2016,09,22
206,Nice hotel but the level is not high,"When I've arrived at The Marker I've fell in love, honestly a beautiful hotel with new and nice rooms. 
Everything was fantastic until the moment when I couldn't access my room anymore since miscommunication is to blame, between their reservations department who were under the impression that I have checked out and front office department, they have packed all my staff and just move to the reception, leaving me without a room, not even calling before doing that. 
Obviously I didn't realise it until the moment (at 11.00pm) I've got back from a tough day and I'd tried to enter in my room....
After 1.5 hour waiting  (since they were fully booked) they found a room for me, and I could go to sleep for that night. 
So sorry, but I can't accept someone to touch my bags and staff without calling me just to check why I've left my staff in there. 
The hotel is fantastic but be careful to reservation. ",2,2016,09,22
206,Excellent Lunch and excellent service,"Myself and my business partner lunch here often. I cannot fault the menu, food and presentation at all. Very well designed and priced menu with many options to choose from. Having eaten in many of the hotels in this area as we work close by, this Is by far our favourite. Long may it continue.",5,2016,09,22
206,A fabulous Stay,"A super hotel with brilliant spa facilities ....very friendly welcoming staff ,fabulous rooms ...the rooftop bar is a must. The location in the docks is very peaceful and a lovely view from or bedroom !

",5,2016,09,21
206,What an amazing hotel in such a unique setting.,"Away from the hustle and bustle of downtown, is The Marker. This area didn't exist so many years ago, and walking around was a pleasure. Across from the hotel, is a canal with kayaks, pontoon boats and motor less waterskiing! Who would have thought? The hotel is terrific and the ambience upbeat 
and businesslike at the same time. The very best club sandwiches in Ireland too!",5,2016,09,21
206,The Marker made a mark on us!,Just absolutely beautiful from check in to check out. Breakfast was excellent which is sometime hard to come by in Europe. We only stayed at the hotel for one night on the way back to the US and really needed a good nights rest. Well we slept like bears! ,5,2016,09,21
206,"Good hotel and service, but slept poorly","Check in was quick, but make sure to check that you can make charges to your room if you plan on doing that. On our check-in they just presented the key and didn't ask for the credit card for room charges and we couldn't make room charges at the bar. Our waiter quickly fixed it, but that was the first time this has happened to me at any hotel.

The room was very nice. The TV was very large and had real high definition channels. WiFi was quick with good coverage in the room. The bathroom was very roomy. The toilet had two buttons and I never could figure out when to push what button, but at least something happened when I pressed the button. But once you press it, don't plan on pressing it again for about 5 minutes or so. Not sure why, but nothing will happen for about 5 minutes and then it will work again.

The HVAC was quiet, but the lowest you could set it was 16C. Their was only a thick comforter on the bed - no sheet.  The comforter must have been rated down to 0C. 16C was not cool enough if you used the comforter. But it was the comforter or nothing since no sheets were on the bed. That may have contributed to my sleeping problem in the hotel as I spent most of the night up trying to cool off.

There are minimal drawers in the room and the closet is on the small side. Most of our clothes stayed in our suitcases. 

They are set up for a buffet in the restaurant for breakfast. You can order off the menu, but that may take a bit of time since they seem to expect you to eat off the buffet. We just kept it simple and did the buffet. It was good and kept very neat by the staff.

Their is a rooftop bar that is accessed via a set of elevators on the right as you enter the hotel. A nice gentleman will let you on the elevator or if it is full up there, will let you know when you can go up. We only had a 3 minute wait when he found us in the lobby bar. Nice views are available and the service excellent.",4,2016,09,21
206,Amazing,"One of the nicest hotels we've ever stayed in. 
Beautiful rooms, very luxurious. Lovely rooftop bar. Food a bit expensive but some nice restaurants in the vicinity. 
Staff friendly but professional. 
Only small gripe is that service in the downstairs bar was very slow. 
We can't wait to return. ",5,2016,09,21
206,Great stay,"Fantastic service , staff very friendly and helpful . Room really spacious , clean , has everything you need  beds are really comfortable 
And big .  Roof bar is pretty cool . Breakfast is buffet is really good . Will definitely stay again . ",5,2016,09,20
206,Wonderful stay with a great room and fantastic staff,"The hotel is beautiful and sits on a gorgeous view. Their are shops and great walkable areas close by, so the location is fantastic. We were greeted warmly by reception and every staff member we interacted with the whole stay were absolutely wonderful. The room was lovely. It was clean, spacious, and very comfortable. The bathroom was gorgeous and had a great tub and shower. The food we ordered from room service was beyond exceptional. 
I will stay here any time we are in Dublin from now on. The hotel itself and staff are beyond compare. ",5,2016,09,20
206,Luxury in the business district,"Fantastic customer service - nothing is too much trouble, even when they are fully booked they are more than happy to suggest alternative accommodation nearby.
The room is amazing and possibly the best bath I've had in a hotel ever. Wonderfully polite and helpful staff.",5,2016,09,20
206,nice  hotel,"PErfect hotel , fashion, modern, great quality.The breakfast is very healthy and you have many options in the men√∫. The rooms have good size  and the bathroom too, its perfect for spend a weekend in Dublin. ",5,2016,09,20
206,A place for a celebration,"We celebrated a family event recently with champagne on the rooftop terrace followed by dinner in the brasserie . Extra items like balloons, personalised menu and birthday plate were all provided.it was a great occasion .

Z
 ",5,2016,09,20
206,City Treat,"Wonderful service from arrival to departure.  We were celebrating a birthday and the complimentary treats and service really made the occasion very special indeed.  Weather was fantastic, so we fully availed of the rooftop bar which was wonderful.  Nice touch to hand out a basket of suncream for the guests who were not under cover. The pool and Jacuzzi were a welcome treat after a day walking the City and dinner in the Brasserie afterwards was excellent.  The room was spotless and not a sound to be heard either from the corridor or the adjoining rooms.  Pillows weren't to our liking, but I suppose that was just us. Well worth it overall as it's top class......we'll definitely be back.",5,2016,09,20
206,Relaxing Experience,"Overall a great place to stay. Food and cocktails were excellent! The roof top bar is beautiful with fantastic views. I would recommend not visiting it in the rain as we sat in the inside area of the room top bar and the noise was unbearable, we had to leave. The staff throughout the entire hotel were very friendly and helpful.",5,2016,09,20
206,Friendliest staff imaginable,"I believe that excellent staff morale is dependent on the excellence of management. If I'm right, the management of the Marker is out of this world. I've never met nicer members of staff than those working at the Marker. From the receptionist who insisted on showing us to our room, to the room-cleaning staff and those who did ""turn down"" in the evenings, to the restaurant staff, each and every one of the people we met was polite, friendly, proactive and efficient. And probably multi-lingual!

Oh. And the shower in our bathroom didn't flood. That is a BIG plus.

Keep it up guys!",5,2016,09,19
206,Wonderful Experience!,From the moment I walked in the door every staff was helpful and friendly. I enjoyed the best meal in Ireland right from my beautiful room. I simply can't wait to stay at the Marker hotel again! Thank you Marker staff!,5,2016,09,19
206,One amazing facility & staff,"Not only was the facility amazing, but the room & staff were great! Comfortable bed, helpful and friendly staff, clean room and hotel. Room service was fast and any problems we had with room service was corrected quickly. ",5,2016,09,19
206,Exvellent,"Had a lovely stay in this hotel last week. Excellent service. Staff very friendly and helpful.
Lovely location, one can sit outside and watch the world go by The rooftop bar is a must for an evening drink. 
Cant fault it.",5,2016,09,19
206,good,Overall it was a good experience and I will definitely be back another time - I have actually booked for this week on another business trip. Thanks to the staff for their courtesy and assistance. Good job,4,2016,09,19
206,Still a Great Hotel,"This was my 4th or 5th time here.  It's a great modern property in the docklands, walking distance to the office. Although I booked on a standard company rate, I was given a canal facing room again at no charge.  Excellent service all around, highly recommended",5,2016,09,19
206,The Total TNT Factor!,"After getting engaged we stayed in the Marker Hotel and from the moment we arrived we received personal attention. The rooms are fantastic and the service is top quality, it is pricey but you get what you pay for.",5,2016,09,18
206,The Services and Staff are just Great,"I encountered issue of lost/ delayed luggage when transit from Paris to Dublin and felt helpless.  Thanks so much to the Marker staff members - Jonathan and Cotentin, who helped me to follow through with the airline, especially Jonathan even in his personal time.  Finally the delayed luggage arrived my hotel room in that evening!!  While I would express my hearty thanks to these 2 staff members, the staff in The Marker were always great and helpful.  I would definitely recommend to stay in The Marker if you would like to stay in Dublin.",5,2016,09,18
206,Great hotel,"Location is very nice, rooms are spacious and quiet, staff is excellent. Food as well is great, we had lunch at the Brasserie and used catering services for our meeting. We (a group of 20 people) stayed there for 4 days and all were very happy with the hotel.",5,2016,09,17
206,More a deluxe king than a luxury suite,"I rate this hotel highly and stay here frequently on business.  Location is a 15 mins walk into the centre, but also in a pleasant area by the water.   Service consistently very good and food is excellent.  Also try out the rooftop bar of you stay here - they don't seem to promote it, but it's worth heading up there for great views.  Spa / pool are usually quiet and are very nicely designed.  My only gripe with this stay was with the so-called luxury corner suite.  A few of the suites are proper suites (presidential suite is vast and a couple of the others have a separate lounge / dining area), but this 'luxury corner suite' was unfortunately more like a good sized king room.  Still a beautifully appointed room, but not ideal for a family of 4 having been promised an upgrade to a suite.  As I said at the outset, I'm a fan of this hotel but feel that the corner suite room description is misleading (OK, it's on the corner but essentially just a large sized King with sofa bed) and not really ideal for a family with 2 children.",4,2016,09,16
206,Dublin hotel,Location was about 15 min walk to city center but has nice market across the street and a couple nice restaurants next door. Hotel was nice and staff were excellent. They helped us book tickets to shows and gave us wonderful restaurant recommendations. ,5,2016,09,15
206,Overpriced for what you receive,I stayed at the Marker whilst in Ireland on a business trip. Having not stayed there previously I decided to try it as an alternative to my usual hotel despite the premium price. For in excess of ‚Ç¨300 for the night I found it hard to justify the price when compared to other similar hotels I have stayed in.,4,2016,09,15
206,1st class hotel and service,"I only had one night at The Marker Hotel but the service from check-in to check-out was faultless. Efficient, friendly staff who were happy to help and offer any advice when asked. 

The room was clean, tidy and had everything that a guest would want or expect. I hope to return for a longer stay soon. 

",5,2016,09,15
206,A wonderful stay at the Marker Hotel,This is a wonderful hotel very well located and within easy reach of all the places of interest. The staff are very friendly and helpful and very willing to help. The Spa area is very well equiped  and clean,5,2016,09,14
206,First Class Service,"My wife and I started our Tour of Ireland in Dublin. So many historic places to see. So many pubs to visit. We decided to spend several day exploring Dublin. we looked at several different hotel, and settled on the Marker and very glad we did. The staff was exceptional, first rate. Landing in Dublin at 8:00am and getting to the hotel by 9:00. I was prepared to wait for a room. We left our bags, went exploring and got a text when our room was ready. The Rooms are large, beds are very comfortable. Resturant for breakfast was very good. Did I mention it is located on the Grand Canal off the Liffy? So great location. On the hop-on-hop-off bus line. And several nice restaurants just a short walk away.",5,2016,09,13
206,Great stay,"The room was well thought and the service was very friendly and helpful. I particularly loved the pool.

It is located in a good location, next to many company, and offers walks around the canal and the river.

Overall, I had an excellent stay there.",5,2016,09,13
206,Excellent in every way,"We stayed four nights at the Marker for my spouse's conference offsite.  The new hotel is very well situated within walking distance to the shopping areas, transit routes, restaurants, the Liffy River, and the waterways. There are some great coffee shops and markets nearby.

We had a corner King room on the first floor with a partial view of the water. There is loads of natural light from the many floor to ceiling windows, with heavy drapes for darkness. The decor is modern and fresh. An extremely comfortable bed and linens.  Excellent quiet A/C and lovely radiant floor heating in the well designed stylish bathroom. One long sink and lots of mirror and light. Very nice bath products. Our only complaint was a lack of adequate drawer space or bathroom hooks. The room was very quiet and peaceful.

We had reasonably good breakfasts included, with hot and cold selections, but omelettes and the like were an added cost. The reception bar is bustling, but the roof top bar is very chic with an outstanding city view - don't miss it!  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and the housecleaning staff were excellent and thorough. We look forward to returning.",5,2016,09,13
206,Nice rooms & pool,"The rooms are nice and big, very comfortable. Not a lot of coatrack, actually non, except in the closet.
Not a lot of space for my stuff in the bathroom.
Nice shower and bath. But impossible to take a bath, only laying is possible. ( like washing hair is not possible).",4,2016,09,13
206,Best Hotel in town,"I really enjoyed spending my time in the Marker Hotel.
The service is upperclass - the all staff was at my disposal for any quieries.
Spa Wellsness is remarkable !!
I strongly recommend the Marker Hotel for futur booking.",5,2016,09,13
206,Exceptional experience at The Marker Hotel!,"My fianc√© and I read wonderful things about The Marker Hotel and several colleagues had recommended we book our stay; but nothing could prepare us for the extraordinary experience we had for just over 24 hrs at the hotel! And we have very high standards when it comes to hospitality. 

The entire staff was attentive, charming, warm, personable and extremely helpful. From the moment we stepped out of the cab till the moment they helped us into a car to the train station. The hotel lobby and rooms are immaculate, modern-yet-cozy, and feel FRESH. The beds were like sleeping on a cloud. The bellman took the time to introduce and explain all of our room's features and facilities, Hani at guest services was sweet and the two young ladies at check in and concierge were fabulously helpful. The rooftop bar is also one of the best views in the city, and being in the spirits industry in NYC, I found their cocktail menu to be extremely impressive (and delicious)! The temperature was bone chilling on the rooftop, but they offer a few heat lamps and blankets which is nice. 

Overall, we highly recommend staying at The Marker if you are in Dublin. It's on the slightly pricier side, but you will quickly realize, and thank yourself, that you made the right decision. You really get what you pay for and much, much more!",5,2016,09,13
206,Excellent service. Beautiful hotel. Perfect location ,"My friend and I stayed here for some of our Dublin stay. Located in the grand canal area of the city, right across from the theatre, it quickly became apparent we had made the right choice. The hotel is modern chic, and from the moment we walked in, we were greeted by friendly and knowledgeable staff. To be perfectly fair, we had made the reservation through bookings.com and although we trusted the reviews (and loved the great deal we got) we had no idea we had walked into one of the nicest, hippest hotels in Dublin. Our room was stunning, with two very comfortable double beds, great view, beautiful decorations, and a great bathroom (with great water pressure!). We immediately phoned the front desk to see if we could extend our stay but sadly there were no rooms available at the rate we'd gotten. After our two day stay we'd left our luggage at the bell desk while we went on an overnight trip to Liverpool. Upon our return, the front desk receptionist not only remembered is, but said what a shame it was that we couldn't get the same price to extend our stay. We couldn't believe that after all the people she must have talked to she remembered us and our request. I would highly, highly recommend this hotel in every aspect. And don't miss their stunning roof deck bar and restaurant, with stunning views and an excellent menu!",5,2016,09,13
206,A Great Experience ,"We had a wonderful stay, the room was one of the largest rooms we have ever had in Europe. The breakfast buffet was great plus you can order eggs and porridge that is included. The hotel is located a easy walk to many great attractions.",5,2016,09,12
206,"First class service, food and drinks!","I just love this hotel!

Cocktails may seem pricey but are well worth it! I'm a cocktail fanatic and these do not disappoint!

Food is delicious.....seafood chowder is amazing! The starter size is more than enough to fill you for dinner!

Staff are extremely friendly and helpful! The Decor is amazing!",5,2016,09,12
206,The best hotel in Dublin!,"The Marker Hotel was certainly a worthy experience and the entire stay could not be faulted. From the welcoming and knowledgeable staff to the entire facilities of the hotel, the experience was excellent.",5,2016,09,11
206,Excellen stay in a real top 5 star hotel. stayed there one month!,"I stayed 30 days in this excellent hotel for my work and the service was great. Great staff, great restaurant, great food, menu, spa treatment, swimming pool, sport gym, sauna, steambath, the bar and restaurant was great, doormen ,concierge, laundry, inroom dining all services were great and staff nice..no comments at all/ I slept every night like a baby. no noise from outside",5,2016,09,11
206,Great quality city hotel,"Stayed on business, so didn't have the opportunity to make use of the spa, but couldn't fault the hotel. 

Reception staff very friendly and helpful, room was very comfortable, as was the bed. Nice touches, like turn down service and slippers ready by each side of the bed 

Simple useful things like multi country power plugs. 

Bathroom large with separate large shower and bath, well decorated. Good nights sleep. Only criticism was a shower temperature which swung from freezing to scalding. A hotel of this standard should really have thermostatic showers and regulated cold water pressure, disappointing, a basic requirement. 

Breakfast was excellent, great choices, beautifully prepared but thought the buffet cooked very over priced at ¬£25

All in all good, will return. ",4,2016,09,11
206,Very good,"Very pleasant stay in a standard but large room with huge bathroom (electric socket in desk didn't work). Iron and board in room plus robes and slippers. Lovely comfortable bed and excellent quality breakfast with reasonable service. Bar very efficient and good service. No view (from my room, 113) but you can't have everything. Happy to recommend.",4,2016,09,10
206,Business Stay,"I had the chance to stay in The Marker.
Great room & facilities.
Unfortunatelyn there was a private event on the rooftop bar.
On night 2, there was a bit of noise coming from that rooftop but everything went silent after 10 pm",5,2016,09,09
206,Excellent Accommodations,Excellent stay and well worth the value.  I highly recommend The Marker.  Very professional and customer service oriented.  The staff was very knowledgeable and very friendly.  They were well informed and looked after all of their customers.,5,2016,09,09
206,Dublin Docklands,"Large comfortable room and bath,  but overpriced.  Located in the Docklands, which is a newer part of town and interesting but a bit away from city center, although reasonably walkable.  Booked a room with two beds, but was not available on check in and had to move during stay.  ",3,2016,09,08
206,Fantastic ,"Simply can't fault it. Great room, great service, great spa, great bar, great breakfast. It's expensive but you get what you pay for to be quite honest. Would definitely stay again. Keep up the good work. ",5,2016,09,08
206,Excellent stay,"Could not fault The Marker hotel. Great hotel located by the bay, good service. There was one day that we left the room late and so the room was not cleaned. That was a minus in my book and odd, guess we left the do not disturb sign on the door.

Our room was large and great!, outside view, sititing area and very large , king size bed, very comfortable. There was also closet space, mini bar and a fabulous bathroom with shower and separate tub.
We did not eat in the hotel so i am not sure what the food is like. We did visit the Rooftop bar and that was nice with an ok view.
Service throughout the hotel was very good, especially the doormen which were very nice and friendly. The front desk men and women we encountered were not that friendly.
The hotel has a luxury aura and standard the will make me recommend. We look forward to visit again.",5,2016,09,08
206,Outstanding Upscale Modern ,"It is a retreat from the Castle Bar crowds, but close enough to easily walk to restaurants and Trinity College.  The reception is competent,  friendly, and quick.  Our room was exceptionally clean and comfortable.   The bar was a fun place .  I would definitely return!",5,2016,09,08
206,Dublin stay for business,Excellent Hotel. Fantastic view. Perfect service. Nothing to complain. I was there for one night but I can say that is one of the best hotel experience for business in my life. I hadn't dinner nor spa so I can't evaluate it.,5,2016,09,08
206,Bliss,"We were treated like royalty from the moment we set foot on the property until after we checked out. The staff were so obliging and helpful, not to mention the complimentary chocolate tarts sent to our room. It was not my first stay with this hotel but I will definitely be back many more times",5,2016,09,08
206,Monday night break,"Could not recommend this hotel more highly! Terrific. Beautiful pool area, room was terrific with everything that you could need including a fantastic bathroom. Excellently situated with respect to the city centre also.",5,2016,09,08
206,Lunch and a Show in Grand Canal .... This is the perfect location ....,"Grabbed a last minute lunch before going to see Billy Elliot and what an unexpected treat. Great food, amazing service, quite spectacular how the service team coped with what was a sudden enormous rush an hour before the show started. 

Great modern menu with a modern twist on many traditional Irish fare. ",5,2016,09,07
206,Great location. Great service.,We stayed at the Marker for a night before we departed on a tour of Ireland. I would highly recommend it. The room was very comfortable and the staff was very friendly and helpful. If I return to Dublin the Marker would be my choice. ,5,2016,09,07
206,Modern Luxury in Historic Dublin,"After some research, found The Marker Hotel as a destination for my 1st trip to Dublin, Ireland.  It's on the River, which is a bit out of the way from the center of the city, but it's a beautiful, cool area.  The Marker was a very comfortable, friendly place to stay for an action packed 3 day Holiday.  Below are my thoughts by category:

Lobby/Dining areas - The Marker has amazing architecture in side and out.  The ceiling of the lobby has cascading cubes - so cool!  it's a big open area with a bar and cocktail lounge and restaurant.  They have a very hearty breakfast buffet with traditional Irish breakfast and lots of healthy options such as fruit, cereals and even chia seeds!  I was quite impressed!

The Staff - everyone is extremely friendly and accomodating.  Also, for every and any request, every person we encountered would do their best as quickly as possible to go above and beyond. I had some postcards I wanted to mail and asked where I could get some stamps.  Instead they told me to just give them the postcards and they would just mail them for me.  I really appreciated that!

The Rooms - My room was great.  It was on the small side, but I believe that's what we paid for.  Beds were SUPER comfy.  Room was immaculate with gratis mineral water and turn down service every night.  For the first night, there was a visual that played on the TV welcoming me to Dublin, and a lovely dessert and card.  Very nice touches!  There were 2 plush robes, slippers and a very luxurious bathroom.  Also, I LOVE Malin and Goetz products so was super happy about the toiletries.  The bathroom was almost as big as the room, which I love and although we couldn't figure out how to work it, the floor could heat up, which was impressive.

All around, The Marker is definitely on my list of favorite hotels I've ever stayed. It was comfortable, luxurious, down to earth and cool.  Again, it was a bit of a walk to the touristy places, but there were always cabs available.  We did not make it to the Rooftop due to crazy Ireland weather and a private event, but that just leaves something else for me to see when I return!",5,2016,09,07
206,Excellent stay,"Myself and my wife had a fabulous stay at The Marker. Beautiful hotel, friendly and really helpful staff. Great area of Dublin to stay in with lots of activities within walking distance. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and definitely will be back! ",5,2016,09,07
206,Fantastic Hotel in Dublin,"Extremely friendly, professional and courteous staff.  Beautiful, clean hotel and rooms.  Room was quiet, was not disturbed by neighbors or noises in the hall.  Food was delicious.  No problems during stay.         ",5,2016,09,07
206,Best Hotel in Dublin,"The hotel is a stunning hotel and is situated in a lovely area in Dublin close to the city centre. On arrival the concierge were extremely helpful and gave a very good first impression of the hotel.

The hotel itself is a stunning building and the rooms are beautiful. The breakfast is very good and there is a lot to choose from. Overall this is one of the best hotels I have stayed in, would recommend to anyone for any occasion. ",5,2016,09,07
206,Dublin Stay,"Excellent hotel; I gave it 5 pillows, my top rating. Best bathroom we've seen in Europe with a real American shower and a separate tub. Very friendly, helpful staff. Very nice part of Dublin. Some issues with dining in the area when the nearby theater has something popular, so plan on eating after 7pm when the restaurants empty.",5,2016,09,06
206,Management went out of their way to make us comfortable,I booked this hotel 10weeks before our arrival to find out that they did not have our reservation. They made sure they researched what happened and to get us checked into a room basically at the last minute. They also brought us a courtesy bottle of wine to our room. The room was a handicapped room and had a really bad odor that it you the minuet you walked in. Service was above and beyond but the room shouldn't have been rented to anyone until it was aired out.,5,2016,09,05
206,Away from the maddening crowds,"Located outside of central city but within walking distance (assuming no rain), this very modern hotel is classy. The rooms are perfect; the indoor pool/gym areas are excellent but it is the staff that really make it - the concierge services is the best you'll find any where. Being on the go, can't rate the restaurant/cuisine.  ",5,2016,09,05
206,Beaultiful & Modern,"Great hotel. Beautiful design. Very nice staff. Top class place. Rooftop is great for a relaxing time before or after dinner. We had a few cocktails, they were lovely and very different from your original cosmopolitan. Breakfast was nice too. Definitly worth the price. The bath is massive and nice minibar snacks. Would definitly recommend to any celebration. ",5,2016,09,05
206,High-end play to stay,"VERY nice hotel.  Generally superb service, with everyone being very nice and helpful (see exception below).  Not in center city, but walkable. Good gym.  Expensive.

One glitch: I booked through Booking.com, and changed the departure date (shortening stay) well before the trip. When I checked in, they still had the old departure date. I corrected it to the clerk, but it turns out she did nothing about it, other than making a handwritten note. When checking out, they refused to take any responsibility or any action... NOT the ideal of service the hotel otherwise displayed",4,2016,09,05
206,Top Marks for the Marker,"What a fantastic place to stay. The hotel is very modern, the rooms are huge but most impressive was the friendly and helpful staff. Special mention for Steven who was very attentive and friendly to our group of 5. And the receptionist who provided great information of where to visit on our trip to Ireland. We stayed here for one night and had dinner in the hotel restaurant and then finished off with drinks on the roof bar. The bath rooms are huge with heated floors which was very nice after a chilly ride on the tour bus. If we ever return to Dublin we will definitely be staying back here.

206,Home away from home,"I stayed at the marker while on a business visit to Dublin.  The property was excellent and service staff exceptional.  I gorged on the delicious food at Brasserie and then worked it off in the infinity pool of the hotel. Regardless of the length of the stay, I recommend this property to the fellow travelers, if you want to feel at home while away from home.",5,2016,09,04
206,Very Modern Hotel,"I was taken to this hotel by my wife as birthday treat to Dublin. A short walk into the city, it boasts very pleasant facilities and remarkably clean. We had a lovely large well air-conditioned room, with a fantastic bathroom with underfloor marble heating. The room was really lovely and the staff very nice and attentive.
We used the hotel pool each day, along with the sauna. Again, a delightful pool with supremely kept facilities, with calming music piped through to the entire spa and pool area. Only sore point was that with all the fantastic facilities on offer, they seemed to close quite early. We never saw the (so called) rooftop bar, is it closed too early for us, or was never open at all! It really has limited functionality, and we were disappointed not to have been able to even get up to the roof top, despite our two and a half day stay.
Despite the fantastic bathroom with walk in shower it was let down by the actual shower itself. The hotel must have run out of money to install thermostatic showers, as the shower kept going from hot to cold on its own, or when another tap was run in the room! Despite a few disappointments, it is a lovely hotel, dark in dingy in places (I think it's the modern way!) with enthusiastic staff in a quieter setting of the outskirts of the city centre. Expect to walk for about 20 minutes to hit the centre, or take one of the many busses available.",4,2016,09,04
206,"Comfortable, modern facility on the canal","Brief stay after a flight from the US.  Little confusing to find in my sleep-deprived state, despite use of a GPS (ie, minimal signage). Friendly, considerate staff.  Nice, central location. Very comfortable, spacious room.  Only minor negative was that the bathroom was a bit dark, making shaving a little more challenging.  Nice spa area.  would definitely return.",5,2016,09,03
206,Upmarket Modern,"We spent 2 nights here and were most impressed with the d√©cor of this establishment. The staff were professional and worked hard to be as helpful as possible.
The view from our corner suite could have been a little better as it looked directly into an office block next door, but the rooms were very well appointed, spacious and clean.
The breakfast buffet was impressive with a large variety of locally sourced hot and cold items on the menu.
The rooftop bar was not open during our stay due to the inclement weather, but would make an ideal place to view the cityscape while relaxing. 
It was some walking distance to the city centre but public transport was also close at hand if needed.
This is a modern slick and well presented hotel which is ideal for the business or pleasure.",4,2016,09,01
206,Birthday weekend,"We had a fantastic time on both occasions when we stayed at the Marker Hotel. Booked the rooftop bar which was great for the afternoon. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to others. Its a relaxed, contemporary hotel with lovely staff.",5,2016,09,01
206,Perfect hotel,"Just perfect: rooms absolutely calm and clean, interiour stylish, service always friendly and helpful. One of the few AC that actually work without being noisy. 

Hotel expensive. Very nice location at the docks. ",5,2016,09,01
206,"Modern, Convenient Hotel (great for business travellers and couples weekends)","The Marker is my go-to for business travel. The wifi is fast and reliable, the hotel is modern, clean, the closest is large for hanging suits, the bathroom is new, the room service menu is great, the hair dryer and iron are new, the AC works, the lobby is ""buzzy"" yet quiet enough for work...honestly it's the only hotel I will stay in for business in Dublin (I regretted straying for The Sherbourne recently - a lovely ""traditional"" hotel but overpriced and not well suited for a business stay). Staying at The Marker feels like a ""workcation""! Recently I stayed over for the weekend - I did not try to rooftop, but I did have a spa treatment. It was excellent. Reasonable prices, very nice facilities, great therapist (Amy). The only thing that is lacking in terms of a ""5 star"" experience is that there are no hair products / hair tools in the locker room. I will be back, again and again and again...",5,2016,09,01
206,Nice modern hotel,"This modern hotel over looks the Grand Canal Square across from the Bord Fais Theate where Billy Elliot is current playing.  Upon out arrival at the Dublin airport laden with our golf bags, our cabbie chatted us up during the 45 minute drive to the hotel which Is located in the old Docklands district but now the financial/theatre district.  The cab for two cost us 49.5 Euros and our cabbie was a delight. Arriving around 11:15AM,  we were pleasantly surprised our room was ready.  With a friendly and efficient check in our bellman had our bags up to our room in no time.  The room had a comfortable king bed with a white leather headboard, white comforter with grey bed spread and ample pillows.  The room had two modern white leather chairs with a small round table.  The bathroom was done out in large squares of white marble with gray accents.  Uniquely, the vanity counter was set low at the soaking tub height, with a very large and deep white bowl for a sink.  An ample frameless shower was in the corner.  While it was  quite a large room, the bath had limited counter pace which for some travelers might prove upsetting.  The overall impression of the hotel room is modern but somewhat utilitarian, sufficient but not given to luxury.  Best of all, the room and hallway were both extremely quiet.

The front desk staff was pleasant and observant, having safely retrieved my back back which I had thoughtlessly left it on a low counch when I checked in.

The hotel has a small dining area on the front  left where dinner and breakfast is served and on the other side of the reception is a large open room hosting the bar looking out over the courtyard across the street.  The back bar is unremarkable and the bar area is populated by low chairs and and couches.  Next to the bar is an elevator which opens at 5 and whisks guests to an impressive open air rooftop bar and dining area, with a small covered dining space hosting the physical bar as well.  The view was excellent in almost all directions.  The furniture was built in surrounding small tables softened by large white cushions.  The wind was creating a bit of a chill and all the seats had light yellow blankets for comfort which many guests were using.  The bar had a large selection of cocktails, most ranging from $13.50 to &15:09 EU while single shots of Burbon started at around 8:50.  My drink, a variation of a Manhattan with Woodruff Reserve was excellent.

There is a Starbucks about a block awaythe same street on the river (or canal?)the Ferryman Hotel with a first floor pub festooned in bright red with black on the outside. The pub was jammed at around 7 (no TV's were noticed) and since they only served sandwiches we headed back to our hotel and continued for about two blocks Stumbling into Milanos, which offered fast and reasonably priced Pizzas and Calzones.  As a Vegan I was thrilled to order a no cheese pizza covers with argulla pine nuts, mushrooms, basil and tomato sauce, the only improvement would have been if the crust had been thinner and harder.  The pricing was excellent and my wife and my bill for two Pizza's, a Diet Coke and a large glass of wine was only 39 Euros.",4,2016,08,31
206,Spa experience ,"Thank you so much Yvette for the extraordinary Lomi Lomi massage!!! I feel so good!!! Yvette was so attentive to my needs! Well done! I recommend this massage,  is so relaxing, your body, mind and spirit  are completely rejuvenated!!!!! A must try experience if you're planning to visit Dublin!!!! Teodora ",5,2016,08,31
206,Super date night ,"I can not think of enough good things to say about our pre-thearte dinner in The Brasserie at The Marker Hotel. We had reserved a table for 4 & as we were early we had a drink in the marvellous lobby area. .it had the feeling of being in a glamorous city in any part of the world. Beautiful glassware & dainty portions of lipsmacking nibbles. There is an overall feeling of calm & not the hassle with luggage - guests checking in & out as in so many big hotels. We had opted for the 2 course menu at  ‚Ç¨28. ..the ' boys ' went for starter & main course & the ' girls' for main course & dessert  ( oh the dessert. ..üòä) this caused no confusion at all with our delightful Venezuelan waitress. The menu is heavy on fish dishes. .i had salmon topped with lotus root on a bed of tiny tiny shitake mushrooms,  it was sitting in a delicious broth which had an Asian flavour. We all decided on the extra  ‚Ç¨4 for chunky chips - in fact on the waitress suggestion we had 2 pails between 4...chips like you have never tasted anywhere, the boys fought over the last one in their shared pail. The amazing dessert had some items that looked like shortcrust but was soft as a cloud & an amazing peach sorbet & other delights. We were not drinking wine on this occasion but there is a magnificent wine list with many available by the glass - the selection of whites was sitting in an ice floe - i expected to see a couple of penguins playing there. The toilets were of  course sleek & spotless. The parking cost almost as much as the meal however. .we are out of towners so had no choice but if you are from Dublin consider a taxi or public transport. We were going to Billy Elliott in the Bord Gais theatre so we could not have been nearer ",5,2016,08,31
206,Top class service at The Marker Hotel! ,"Me and my husband stayed at The Marker over the August Bank Holiday for 2 nights to celebrate his 40th birthday, and I have to say it was a great experience. The most notable thing I would say is the attentiveness of the staff, they really can't do enough for you and not in an overbearing suffocating way either. Just the right balance between excellent customer service but allowing you the space/freedom to enjoy your meal, drinks, etc, etc

The rooftop bar was great, excellent service (they even brought sun cream round to see if you needed any as the sun was shining!), and gorgeous cocktails. It opens at 5pm and by 5.30/6pm it had gotten quite busy, so probably worth trying to book a table in advance. Drinks are a bit pricey, but then again you are drinking in a top quality roof top bar! 

We had breakfast twice but as room service both times as opposed eating in the restaurant, and it was lovely, a tad expensive, but again, when you're staying in a quality hotel you expect to pay a little more, so we didn't mind, plus it was really tasty. 

The spa is great, lovely and clean, felt very luxurious and plush. The only complaint I would have about the spa is the fact that children are permitted to use the pool. And unfortunately during the hour or so we had in the spa on the Saturday morning there was a group of about 4 children who were dive bombing in the pool. Might not bother some people, but for me, I just felt if ruined the feeling of relaxation and tranquility having the kids splashing around and being loud. There were signs saying that children under 16 shouldn't use the jacuzzi, steam room, sauna, but the kids (who were aged probably 8-12 yrs) did get into the jacuzzi with us at one point. 

Location wise it's about a 20-25 min stroll into the hustle and bustle of the main pubs, shopping, etc. We also saw an event at the 3Arena on the Friday evening, and that's about a 10-15 min stroll from the hotel. The hotel is about 15-20mins in a taxi, costing about ‚Ç¨30. 

I had emailed the hotel prior to our arrival to ask if they could arrange for a little something to be left in the room on our arrival to mark the occasion (i.e. my husbands 40th), and they had responded to say they would do something and that it would be down to the discretion of the manager on the day as to what it would be. But unfortunately it must have slipped through the net as there hadn't been anything left in the room when we arrived. I could have popped down to reception to chase it up, and they may well have arranged for something retrospectively, but I didn't really get the chance to speak to anyone with my husband always being around! Plus it was only intended as a little extra bonus gesture to my husband as a nice surprise on arrival, and as it was going to be complimentary and the moment had passed if you like, I just left it.

Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our weekend in Dublin, and The Marker Hotel contributed to our overall enjoyment of the weekend. A top class hotel, very clean and lush, modern and impeccable service from everybody we encountered at The Marker Hotel. Would definitely recommend! ",5,2016,08,31
206,Great Service,We stayed at the Marker for the first time on Sunday to celebrate our 7 year anniversary and the service from any staff member that we saw or spoke to was impeccable. The whole experience was amazing and they even gave us a congratulations plate with some beautiful tasting brownies for our anniversary which is a lovely touch. I would recommend the Rooftop Bar on a sunny day for some amazing views over Grand Canal to the Wicklow Mountains.  I can only hope for another opportunity to be able to stay there.,4,2016,08,31
206,Romantic Break,Beautiful retro hotel. Shame the rooftop wasn't open on Mondays as the weather was beautiful. Lovely big room with really reasonable room service charges which are much appreciated. Strongly recommend for anyone,5,2016,08,31
206,Great staff but not 5*,"
Staff were great &friendly but the room was not 5*, and the surroundings in the public areas had not very friendly feel. Also the prices were quite steep for basics. Also over weekend ( Sunday) no room cleaning till late in evening had to call to get room and clean towels after 2 days ",3,2016,08,31
206,OK hotel but you could do better,The hotel is a little out of the way for the sights and I would prefer to be closer to the centre. The rooms are OK but not that special and the same is true of the breakfast. I think it needs to up its game to justify the price tag.,3,2016,08,30
206,Super service,"Super service by amazing staff, every effort was made to make our stay a special. Looking forward to our next visit to the hotel and spending some time on the rooftop bar with family. Special mention for Godfrey a super host.",5,2016,08,30
206,Great hotel.,"The staff was friendly, the location was convenient,the room was beautiful, bathroom was great. I really enjoyed my stay, the restaurant had delicious food. The rooftop bar and pool were great. Everything  was excellent with my stay ",5,2016,08,30
206,Weekend break,"Excellent hotel, thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Rooftop bar needs to be more accessible to guests and rooms could do with some more clothes drawers. Location is great, staff were very helpful, all in all, perfect.",4,2016,08,30
206,Marker - top service,Arrived early on the Friday morning (booked Fri night) and was immediately given access to room. Courtesy and style underpins everything about the Marker. The spa is great (steam room and jacuzzi excellent). Easy walk to Shelbourne Park for anyone going racing.,5,2016,08,30
206,Outstanding service at the Marker,"I stayed at The Marker when travelling for business last week and the experience end to end was outstanding. The staff consistently went out of their way to help meet our every need.  Getting back from a run? A water bottle is waiting.  Need help with your room key? The front desk staff is right out to help.  The rooms were well appointed and very comfortable. So nice to have a king size bed!!!
I would go back in a hearbeat.",5,2016,08,29
206,Marker,"Very professional staff. Nice clean room. Real coffee in the room. Newspaper at the door. Located near restaurants, grocery store and theater. View of the river from our room. Great Buffett and friendly service. ",5,2016,08,29
206,Amazing design hotel! ,"With my hospitality background I can tell this hotel, checks all the boxes. Their staff is extreemly service minded, well trained and pay a lot of attention to the details. Upon arrival they accompanied me to the hotel with an umbrella to ensure I would not get wet by the rain. The hotel rooms are spacious and the bathroom is unbelievable, even while I was an a business trip I could not help myself to take a bath every evening. Kudos to the staff and the beautiful designed hotel! ",5,2016,08,29
206,We were treated well,"My wife and I stayed at The Marker on July 11, 2016 prior to boarding a cruise ship. We found the rooms to be of an appropriate   size and decor for a five star hotel. The service was excellent. One of the assistant mangers, Liam, went out of his way to help us when a tour company failed to pick us up for a tour.The  staff at The Marker cared about us.",5,2016,08,28
206,Fantastic Hotel with Fantastic Staff,"Right from the moment we walked through the door we were greeted with a smile and dealt with very quickly. We arrived at 9am due to a very early flight ad the staff had our rooms ready which was a welcome relief after a 3am start. The hotel was spotlessly clean, the staff couldn't have been more helpful and the rooms were beautiful. We not hesitate to stay at The Marker again would recommend it to anyone.",5,2016,08,28
206,The best celebration destination in Dublin ,"Have stayed many times at The Marker but it just keeps getting better and better. The location is a short taxi hop or longer stroll to the tourist shopping hub of Grafton Street but is a vibrant quay side area in its own right with plenty of restaurants nearby. The interior is strikingly modern but with an emphasis on comfort. The rooftop bar affords panoramic views all over the city and is an unbeatable location for cocktails at any time but particularly on a fine summer evening. Rooms and bathrooms are super comfortable and luxurious.  Some months ago we holed up at the Marker for my daughter's 21st and they went to tremendous lengths to spoil us. And again for a recent birthday weekend my family and I were offered a very reasonable price to upgrade to the top floor suite of rooms which were jaw droppingly gorgeous. Although the service is always impeccable, on this occasion I would single out the attention of Barry on the concierge desk who really moved mountains to get a variety of restaurant bookings etc for our party. Furthermore the maitre d in the bar brasserie who again went the extra mile to ensure my young family got some lunch during a particularly hectic pre theatre sitting. The attitude is always can do. It's a perfect place. ",5,2016,08,28
206,Dublin experience,"Great location, within walking distance to eateries, pubs, sights and transportation. Great mix of people, culture and businesses. Lots of construction happening. Happy people who know their history and enjoy life as it happens. Old and new combined.",5,2016,08,27
206,Rooftop Bar,Me and a couple of friends went to the rooftop bar for a private drinks event. The food is very good. Drinks are also good. On a sunny afternoon the views from the roof top were amazing. Lucky that it wasn't raining or windy.,4,2016,08,27
206,Very good Hotel but situation not very near center,"  Very nice room quite location impressive pool good breakfast with large assortment Roof Bar with nice view on the City Not very near from the center you have to walk around half an hour Nice people ready to help you",4,2016,08,27
206,Great food and service,"Fantastic place for food and so close to the Bord Gais energy theatre, perfect for pre show drinks and food, next time we will stay as the staff were lovely and the food was superb and very quick service, we had heard about the Marker hotel from friends so it came highly recommended thanks",5,2016,08,27
206,World Class!,"We had an exceptional stay at The Marker Hotel Dublin. The welcome we received upon arrival was warm and friendly yet remained professional. All members of staff appeared calm throughout our stay. Our room was tastefully modern and very clean, lovely touch with the welcome message on the TV screen. Would definitely recommend and return ourselves! ",5,2016,08,26
206,An fantastic weekend,"Went to see Billy Elliot with my son over the weekend and stayed in this beautiful hotel for 2 nights. So handy, friendly helpful staff, lovely food, I will without a doubt be back! Thank you for a lovely weekend. My son also had a fantastic time",5,2016,08,26
206,LOVELY HOTEL.  WE SHALL RETURN,"The Marker is a class act in every way.  The rooms are elegant and quiet.  There is always a nice variety of quality food available, either in the bar area or the main restaurant. The bathrooms are wonderful, especially the heated floors.   I can recommend this hotel without hesitation. ",5,2016,08,26
206,Beautiful 5-Star Property,"The Marker hotel is a fantastic property. From the small embellishments - such as a French-press coffee maker in the room - to the hotel's restaurants and lounges and overall architecture, this is a great place to stay in Dublin. The staff is outstanding and the rooftop bar has great ambience. Highly recommended - I will be back!",5,2016,08,25
206,Luxurious hotel with excellent customer service,My wife and I stayed at the Marker hotel at the tail end of your honeymoon in Ireland and could not have been more pleased with the accommodations and attention to detail.  The hotel went out of their way to ensure we had a wonderful stay including providing a complimentary bottle of champagne and some sweet treats for to celebrate our honeymoon.  The hotel pool and spa were a lovely reprieve after traveling for two weeks.   ,5,2016,08,25
206,Great hotel,"Stayed here for two nights on a recent visit to Dublin. It is located next to the grand canal in a great location. Food was good, not great. Unfortunately the rooftop bar, which has been reported to be outstanding, was closed during our visit.",5,2016,08,25
206,top class,"A truly memorable experience. The room was spacious and bright. Staff were very helpful and pleasant. The little extras are a real treat, the cocktail on arrival, newspapers in the morning outside room, cosy blanket on the rooftop bar to keep warm.",5,2016,08,25
206,"Rooftop bar, yes please ","What a great place to while away a couple of hours before attending a show in bord gais theatre (directly opposite). If it's sunny, this is a beautiful spot to relax, have a bite to eat and a few cocktails. The rooftop menu is small eats, tapas style. Very tasty and surprisingly filling. They have a full bar but the cocktails are delicious. The staff hand out sun lotion in various spfs when the sun shines and blankets when it's chilly. I love this place. ",4,2016,08,24
206,Very good but not perfect,"The check in was friendly and quick, but the lady was not really interested in me and my plans for Dublin. Room was not ready, unfortunately, no Alternative was offered. The room later was very proper and spacious. The Spa is a very nice feature, but nothing special! The breakfast was amazing, nice staff, a good selection of Superfood and healthy things!!!",4,2016,08,24
206,Modernity in Dublin!,"We had two stints in Dublin during our trip to Ireland.  The second time we stayed at The Marker, which is an ultra-modern property near the docks.  After having stayed primarily in more old-world like properties for the past week, we were ready for a little 21st Century luxury.  The room was very sleek and comfortable, and the bathroom offered all amenities imaginable.  We went up to the very trendy roof-top bar for a drink in the late afternoon, and it was alive with music and a mostly younger crowd.  The service was excellent.  One issue, which had nothing to do with the hotel, was that the Irish Iron-Man competition was being held the next morning, which meant that the bridges and major road near the hotel would be shut down for several hours that morning.  The hotel staff was helpful in advising us as to how we could circumvent any problems logistically that morning.  Our room was on the floor just below the roof-top bar.  As a word of caution, I will mention that we could definitely hear the music and the throbbing of the bass, particularly.  I called the front desk to inquire as to when they music would end.  I was told that the last-call at the bar is 10:45 and that it would stop shortly thereafter.  They were true to their word, and by 11:00 p.m., all was quiet, and we were able to get a good night's sleep.  All in all, it's a first class hotel, and I would recommend it.  While it's not in the city center, we did walk to Temple Bar, and it was very doable.",4,2016,08,24
206,A Fantastic stay at the Marker Hotel,"We had an awesome experience staying at Dublins Marker Hotel.
Excellent service, fine food and drink and amazing rooftop bar. 
The Hotel was very clean.It had an amazing pool and Spa area.
It was central to amenities,beautiful location and wonderful views.
Definitely will return.

Very modern and its immaculate, felt so relaxed and spoilt here .. The Staff are amazing and always there if you need anything !!! The roof bar was a treat !!! Blankets at the ready if chilly!!! Go here to treat yourself it's worth every penny can't wait to go again !!!!",5,2016,08,23
206,Superb Experience,"The view was stunning, even on a cloudy evening. The staff were welcoming and extremely attentive, efficient and pleasant throughout. The food was superb and probably the best in Dublin for platters, faultless. A big thank you from all at Lansdowne Partnership,Estate Agents.",5,2016,08,23
206,First visit to the Marker Hotel,"Stayed two nights with a group of friends over from London, and what a lovely experience, from the moment we arrived till we left, each and everyone of the staff are friendly and helpful, the rooftop bar is a must see, weather permitting, 
Can't wait to visit again",5,2016,08,23
206,Excellent service,We stayed for 6 days.  The service was second to none.  A wonderful roof top dinner started the trip and things didn't go downhill at all from there!  Enjoyed the vibe and buzz of the Bar both afternoon and evenings.,5,2016,08,22
206,Great hotel in a quiet location,"We stayed here during our visit to Dublin and were very happy with our choice. The hotel is modern and very comfortable. The staff always seems to know that you are a guest and can't do enough to be helpful in any way possible. Our room was very nice...everything seems fairly new and was very clean. The bathroom was all marble from top to bottom and also very new and clean. We particularly loved the location of this hotel because, while it was within easy walking distance of many sights, it was away from the mainstream hubbub of the crowds and noise. It was a pleasure to come back to it after a long day of sightseeing. There was a very large and wonderful Fresh marketplace across the street that has everything one could want which was convenient for wine, cheese, coffee and prepared foods. There was also a beautiful spa/gym/pool facility that we hardly used but checked out and were very impressed.",5,2016,08,22
206,Quaint hotel on Silicon Docklands,"Pleasant hotel, somewhat limited food options within a reasonable proximity.   Does not participate in major reward programs (Marriott Rewards, Hitlton Honors, etc.) but wonderful beds and rooms.   Heated tile floors in the bathrooms were a nice touch.  ",4,2016,08,22
206,Stunning hotel with great views,We stayed at the Marker Hotel at the end of a 10 day Scotland-Ireland vacation. It was very relaxing and convenient to city center. The staff was also incredible in helping my fianc√©e propose! We couldn't have asked for a better stay. Highly recommended to anyone staying in Dublin for holiday or work. ,5,2016,08,22
206,had a very pleasure time !!,every thing was perfect except the breakfast I recommend to have breakfast out side the hotel there are many better options just around the hotel .. the staff are much more than friendly very well trained and veeeery helpful I felt like I am in  CASTLE !,4,2016,08,22
206,Top marks,"Great visit from start to finish, from the valet parking to the concierge service to our room, would highly recommend this hotel. The rooftop bar is a must; amazing views and a cocktail-lovers' paradise. The hotel is a great base from which to visit Dublin's attractions and its location on the canal means no unwanted noise pollution. I had the best nights sleep between the quietness and the terrifically comfy bed. Will definitely be returning for our 4th stay soon.",4,2016,08,21
206,Irish Vacation,Awesome trip made even more special by superb accommodations and the support of the staff at The Marker! We'll be back next year and the year after that to carry on the tradition! Thanks to the entire team!,5,2016,08,21
206,SUPERB HOTEL,Loved this modern hotel which is just the right size - not too big so everything is to hand.  Liked the decor in the bar and restaurant and loved the room especially the bathroom with the underfloor heating.  Breakfast was really good.  Liked the bar and dinner in the restaurant was very nice although not the best meal we had in Dublin.  Only downside would be the distance from the city centre - about a 20 minute walk -which doesn't seem like far but after a long day sightseeing it does get a bit tiring.  Reception staff very pleasant and helpful.  There was a charge on the bill for a mini bar item which we had not had but it was rectified without question. We regretted not using the pool as when we checked it out on our last day it looked inviting.,5,2016,08,21
206,Exceptional experience of food & service,"We stayed in The Marker on our recent trip to Dublin & have to compliment the staff for the wonderful experience.  Lunch & dinner & breakfast were very satisfying most notably the starters of smoked salmon mouse with trout tartare, & the pork cheek. Mains of Lemon chicken & desert of hazelnut cake with salted caramel ice cream ""to die for"".   Smoked salmon & scrambled eggs a must for best quality Irish salmon.  Service here is what sets this hotel apart from any other in the City & staff are very knowledgable of food & wine recommendations . Rooms are very comfortable as expected in this 5 star.  Swimming pool & spa to enjoy along with rooftop terrace bar. 
A return visit a must. ",5,2016,08,21
206,Beautiful stylish hotel,"The hotel is very stylish and beautiful. The room we stayed was amazing although there were some details you'd expect not to see in a five star hotel like visible electric wires. But beside this minor detail there's nothing to say about it. The room had an amazing view over the Grand Canal Square.
We had breakfast served in our room at the time we asked for, so no delays. The staff was always helpful and very nice.
The spa and indoor swimming pool are simply amazing.
It was a very good experience and we certainly want to repeat.",5,2016,08,20
206,Outstanding modern Dublin hotel,"Stayed here one night on the tail end of a trip.
Check-in and bell staff were outstanding.
Concierge went above and beyond to help us find a specific jersey just after most stores closed.
Rooms were beautiful and modern (though could ensure outlets on either side of the bed).
Bathroom was spacious, modern, and clean.
Never got to use the health club.
The bar staff went out of their way to help my daughter celebrate her 18th birthday.
Would definitely stay here again when in Dublin.",5,2016,08,20
206,Dominic & Ali,"It would be nice if the staff believed us when we said that we had not taken anything from the mini bar instead of charging us ‚Ç¨18.50 for a bottle of wine the day after we had left  by making an unauthorised card transaction.  Granted when contacted they did apologise and refund us but it was annoying considering everything else about our stay had been very pleasant.  Not the best way to remember our 10th wedding anniversary outing.  Still, the pre-theatre dinner in the Brasserie was very good and breakfast was also very good.  The staff were lovely and we might well stay there again.        ",4,2016,08,19
206,Cool spot to stay,"really enjoyed the hotel and bars - could have been a little closer to town.  Facility itself is beautiful and very comfortable and welcoming.  Staff is very friendly, views from the rooftop bar is fantastic!
",4,2016,08,19
206,Great hotel,"Great hotel in good location. Great service. Only issue was air conditioning in our room- we were told it worked but it wasn't cooling like my brother's room on a different floor. All in all though, a great hotel. ",5,2016,08,19
206,So-so experience,"Make sure you do your homework...the much touted roof bar was closed the two days we spent at the hotel.  Service at The Brasserie was terrible and the food entirely unremarkable.  You'd do much better, and certainly pay much less, eating elsewhere, which is a shame because the space it great.  ",4,2016,08,19
206,Great stay in Dublin,Our stay at the Marker exceeded our expectations.  The corner suite was nicely situated and the room was very clean and comfortable.  The breakfast buffet was excellent.  Hotel location is also ideal.  Thanks for a pleasant stay. ,5,2016,08,18
206,Great place in Dublin,"Excellent hotel with a fantastic restaurant . Service more than adequate to its category . Staff is extremely Kind  and professional. No doubt the Marker is the best modern style hotel in town . There are others of superior quality but different like the Marrion hotel . 

",5,2016,08,18
206,Perfect Hotel,Great hotel with extremely helpful and friendly staff. Rooftop bar is a must and the pool is excellent. A little out of the center but great location by the canal docks and walkable  to Temple Bar and O'Connell Street. Perfect for a peaceful night's sleep in a busy city.,5,2016,08,18
206,Perfect Pitstop for our Honeymoon Tour of Ireland,"We were made to feel really special when we arrived here for the first few nights of our honeymoon. The hotel is beautiful, modern and excellently positioned in Dublin in walkable distance from many sites and attractions. Thank you very much for a lovely stay!",5,2016,08,18
206,A cool hotel in a cool location,"Even before we arrived, we suspected that the Marker would be good. We were contacted by the pre-stay concierge - a first - who quietly & competently arranged a table for dinner and for valet parking to be available when we arrived.

The welcome was warm and the hall porter whisked our bags to our room whilst the friendly reception team checked us in. A morning newspaper & an early morning call were seamlessly arranged before we were shown to our bright light room overlooking Grand Canal Square - quite a contrast to the corridors which seemed to exist in a sort of Stygian gloom.

We had plenty of time for a walk around this buzzing waterside district which epitomises the New Dublin, bright, sophisticated and full of confidence and a mix hotels, the Bord Gais theatre, offices, apartments & some shops. Of the last, Fresh - the Good Food Market was a real find, reminding nothing so much as the Wholefood Market stores in the US. The range was extensive and the staff helpful.

We had been invited to a reception on board the Italian Navy sail training ship, Amerigo Vespucci, which was docked at the nearby Sir John Rogerson Quay. This was probably just as well as the Roof Top Bar at the Marker was closed for a private party - such a disappointment, and the Lobby Bar, in consequence was heaving. The Italian Navy saved the day with some excellent Prosecco & canap√©s before we headed back to the Brasserie for dinner. 

We both chose the sea trout  tartare and the roast cod - the latter was cooked sous vide and it was quite clear that there is some serious talent in the kitchens - it was very good. The less said about the wine choice, the better. Nothing stood out  but our waiter recommended something called Evolution White 16th edition from Oregon in the US - in spite of serious doubts, we went for it and it was quite frankly - strange.

We slept very well and the morning alarm call allowed time for some yoghurt & coffee before we headed to the Irish Ferries terminal for the fast ferry to Holyhead.",5,2016,08,18
206,The Best Hotel in Dublin!,"I enjoyed every minute staying in Marker Hotel. 
We tried a lot of different types of cocktails at rooftop bar. We enjoyed amazing view from there. Staff is amazingly helpful and polite. We been treated as a high class. 
Also enjoyed the area around Marker Hotel. So clean, safe and peaceful.
Our bedroom was huge, clean and unique. 
The marble bathroom was class.
I would definitely stay in this hotel again.
I recommended it to all my family and friends.",5,2016,08,18
206,Much ado about nothing,"The Marker Hotel is the only negative thing I could say about an otherwise perfect 2 week vacation in Ireland (I stayed in 3 other hotels during trip that were amazing).  Rates are very high for views of a canal in a business district that is dead at night. The architecture is a cheap knock-off of surrounding lovely buildings - a decorated box with silly details to try and make it look cool.When I complained as I was told breakfast (at $32 a person) was included in my $700 a nite room, staff were non responsive and when I paid myself, the food was OK at best. When I expressed my disappointment I was given a box of donuts for my trip to the airport and told that the Marker is a world destination. Hardly.  -- 3 other hotels in Ireland were lovely!!-- Great food, hospitality -- would go back to any of them. A real rip off here.",2,2016,08,17
206,Great hotel if you're looking to walk around Dublin,"The Marker is a bit off the normal tourist path, but it's an easy walk to the downtown, Temple Bar, and Trinity College areas. An added bonus is that also is a reasonable walk to the Sandymount area that has some really nice restaurants that aren't as touristy.

The staff was great and incredibly helpful. 

I didn't get a chance to take advantage of the rooftop bar as the night I had free to go up there the weather was a bit too Irish and they had the outdoor seating closed and only limited space left.

Bottom line - if you're open to walking about a little, then I highly recommend the Marker. If you're looking to be within a few hundred meters of all the tourist stuff, then you probably want to choose somewhere else.",5,2016,08,17
206,A true 5 star experience,"We stayed for two nights, which was enough time to experience the best that the hotel has to offer. 

Compared to our other hotel choices in Killarney, Galway, Birr, and Clontarf, the Marker's fit and finish was a cut above. It was the only truly ""5 star"" experience we had. Staff attentiveness/attitude, amenities, concierge, room service, and roof top bar were all excellent. Everyone was focused on making our stay special. The room felt brand new. 

The only negative was that the water temperature in the shower cycled between lukewarm and hot. An odd footnote to an otherwise outstanding visit.",5,2016,08,17
206,Extra days in Ireland,"Thank you for a lovely stay.  Your hospitality and friendliness was wonderful.
beds were good as well loved the heated bathroom floor.  As two seniors making the rounds of Dublin, we had a grand time. Enjoyed the nearby restaurants. Loved the pub the ""Hairy Lemon""",5,2016,08,17
206,A lovely stay but some little changes needed...,"My husband and I really enjoyed our short stay at the Marker hotel but compared to other high-end hotels we've stayed in before, we felt a few tweaks were needed... 
Our first impressions of the hotel was impressive, it really does feel like a luxury hotel from entering the reception. Front of house staff couldn't of done enough to help us and their consistent attention to detail, speedy check-in and check-out and knowledge of the area were superb. We had a morning flight so our room wasn't ready but they allowed us to use all amenities in the spa in order for us to freshen up and get on with our day. This was a very welcoming aspect as the spa was lovely. They called us when our room was ready and took our cases to the room for us. We had a deluxe room facing the canal and on first impressions, it seemed very top-end. However, it was when you looked closer at the final details that we noticed poor attention to detail such as the bath had cracks in; no USB charge points and the charge point that was there was only suitable for an iphone4 which for a new hotel, is quite dated. We also felt that the amenities weren't great and had to ask at reception for more shower gel etc. As we used both the shower and bath. The room was very clean though. We booked a breakfast inclusive rate so we had the full Irish buffet at the Brasserie. The cereal and fruit selection was good, as was the typical hot food such as: scrambled egg, potatoes, sausage and bacon however, anything else was made to order such as toast, porridge, any other kind of egg other than scrambled etc. Tea and coffee also needed serving. The restaurant wasn't particularly busy but this still took too long for the food to come to us, often meaning the egg came without the toast so it was cold whilst waiting, or we'd be waiting 20 mins between being served more tea/coffee etc. When my porridge finally arrived, it was like water! The waitress also got our toast order wrong twice so we had to wait a further 10 mins. The selection of pastries was also poor. This wasthe main downfall of the hotel as breakfast is very expensive, however the food we had (apart from the porridge!) was good. We felt that these little quibbles can be easily rectified to make this hotel a truly luxurious one and one that is worth the extra money. ",4,2016,08,17
206,Great stay,"great hotel, only thing I could fault is the breakfast which was not as good as I would have expected. The spa and all other facilites were fantastic and I would stay here again. I did not find the prices over the top",5,2016,08,17
206,Beautiful hotel!,"Simply beautiful hotel. Can not put my finger on anything. Big rooms, excellent service, great bar and roof top bar. Nice pool. Didn't get to try out the spa facility, but I suspect it is wonderful! Would love to come back! ",5,2016,08,16
206,What an experience,first class service from start to finish cannot recommended this hotel enough...staff were amazing so friendly and accomadating when at dinner the beverage that I usually drink at home was not available the bar staff went out of their way to make me up a drink that I would like the attention to detail made myself and my partner feel so special will def be back,5,2016,08,16
206,Anniversary Stay At The Marker,"My wife and I stayed recently at the Marker. This is now our favorite hotel in Dublin. The hotel facilities are excellent, staff are friendly, polite and always there to help. And if you stay here - try and make it to the rooftop bar. Great views and great drinks.",5,2016,08,16
206,Below Average,"5 star price but 3 star service, how its a member of the leading hotels of the world I just cant understand. I have lots of experience staying in  leading hotels all over the world, I can honestly confirm this hotel would get a rating of a 3 star.

Restaurant  staff are not trained to standard, lots of  silly mistakes made. Service very slow, food not cooked as ordered, even when food sent back still not cooked as ordered, plates not cleared after courses and the dessert plates honestly must have been on the table for well over a half a hour after finishing before they were cleared.

Spa was a let down also , pool had children playing ball making lots of noise, not enough hocks for robes or seats to sit., pool area was very busy it was like a train station. No wet flip flops given so your slippers got very wet and the floor was very slippy and dangerous, not relaxing at all. Water offered in plastic cup and tap water no jugs of nice flavored water here !! No extra towels around the pool area or in changing room, I had to walk back to spa reception to get a towel for my hair. Floor is the spa is a accident waiting to happen.

Rooms, basic even in the corner suite no turn down service offered you must request, and when we did they just offered us chocolates, and walked away ! No bed turn down or bathroom service at the marker !! 
Tea and coffee in the room, the coffee pot was dirty and had not been washed after last guest. Air Conditioning was broken in the room, so room was very warm , we were given a noisy fan to sleep with all night.

I was locked out of my room, I asked a manager in the lift if he could let me in or phone reception to send someone up to let me in , he told me he could not and I had to go to reception for a new key, the service was so poor. 

Breakfast , I only had experience was getting a coffee, again the coffee area was out of hot water for tea and out of water for the coffee machine, the Manger who I requested more water off, he did not even respond to my request just took the water pot off me and walked away , they went to his desk with the pot marked a few things down on the paper sheet when ready then went off for the water, actually funny at how bad the service is.

Rooftop
We enjoyed the rooftop, the Manager here was a lovely man so friendly and helpful. 

Overall if you are looking for a luxury stay and that 5 star service , I would recommend the Merrion or the Westbury in Dublin, the Marker is one step above a Holiday ",2,2016,08,16
206,Very Nice Hotel,"Overall a great hotel.  Food, service and environment were all excellent.  For a family with young children, pool hour limitations on children was very disappointing.  Staff were very helpful in all respects.",4,2016,08,16
206,Great Hotel Great Location 5* Staff,"I stayed at The Marker with my best friend on our long weekend trip to Dublin. I can only sing my praises for this hotel. Staff really efficient nothing was too too much trouble and so friendly. Reception staff were super helpful supplying us with a map and out lining the quickest route into the city centre and info of all the good bars and restaurants. Our 5th floor twin room was lovely with a view out over the canal, bright and cheerful with an amazing bathroom complete with underfloor heating. I think I had the best sleep ever in a hotel room beds comfy and very quiet you couldn't hear anything not even a the next room's loo flush which is usually the norm in a hotel. The hotel itself is styled with quite a dark theme which at first was a little strange but it became very relaxing after all the hustle and bustle of the city. Our saving grace from all the walking around the city was the beautiful spa/pool after being welcomed by a very smiley receptionist given towels you arrive in this calming pool just the right temperature with loungers to unwind in, or just sit in the hot spa and let the bubbles take your aches and pains away. Then finish of your day with a visit to the rooftop bar via the hilarious banter from ""Tommy"" the guardian of the lift. This hotel is a great location if you want to stay away from the noise of the city. About a 20min walk to the city via the canal route most scenic. It's 100yrs from the Bord Gais Energy Theatre with some great bars and restaurants all in the square. Great hotel fab staff loved it, will definatly stay again when visiting Dublin 5* from me for staff and service",5,2016,08,16
206,A superb hotel with the most attentive staff,"We had a really lovely stay, starting with the roof top bar - great cocktails in the evening and a superb meal in the restaurant followed by a good nights rest in a lovely room - the sound proofing in the bed room was probably the best we`ve experienced in any hotel of a similar calibre",5,2016,08,16
206,"Luxery hotel, not cheap.","The staff was very  friendly, very nice corner-room.
Breakfast was the best I ever had.
Not enough seats to relax by the pool.
Center of the city is a 20 min walk.
The hotel is locaties in a nice place, near by a dock and new  facilities.
",4,2016,08,16
206,Lovely but overpriced,Lovely hotel but definitely overpriced. Staff were very helpful especially Liam. Rooftop bar is a must see. However do not book a room for 3 as you're paying full price for a cot bed which is very disappointing. ,4,2016,08,16
206,5-stars to the staff at the Marker,"My Fianc√©e and I spend two lovely nights at the Marker. The staff were wonderful and even provided a complimentary bottle of Champagne when I mentioned (only in passing) that my Fianc√©e and I were celebrating our engagement.

On that note, the staff were what really made the experience for us - everyone was exceptionally polite, helpful and courteous which really made the experience the full 5-stars.

The only disappointment was that we did not get the opportunity to experience the rooftop bar on this occasion - we had a packed sightseeing schedule. I guess we will have to save this for out next visit to Dublin and the Marker Hotel.",5,2016,08,15
206,Excellent stay in a lovely part of Dublin,"My husband, son and I recently stayed for one night to go to Billy Elliot.
We really enjoyed every aspect of our stay. It has become our son's favourite hotel as he just loved being called ""Sir"" every time we went in or out of the hotel! ",5,2016,08,15
206,Best hotel I have ever stayed in,"Just had a fantastic stay at the marker! Nothing was too much trouble at this hotel, they went out of their way to make us feel special! Food was amazing and the spa facilities are to die for. Would highly recommend! ",5,2016,08,15
206,"Great Service and Bar, Average Rooms ","Was looking forward to staying at The Marker. It's a little on the expensive side but  Initial impressions from the valet parking to check-in was very good. Staff were so pleasant and helpful and that continued for our entire stay. The only thing that lets the hotel down is the rooms which are modern but distinctly average. Reasonable in size, very comfortable but distinctly bland in terms of decor. Food and drinks were excellent and the roof top bar is lovely but slightly windy. The only issue is the rooms themselves unfortunately. ",3,2016,08,15
206,Maker Hotel - convenient location,"good modern hotel, well located, clean and tidy, great for the airport bus 757 and for getting to the train stations/ centre of Dublin.

Restaurants serve good, modern cuisine, check in check out process very efficient - public transport easy to find around the hotel.",4,2016,08,14
206,Decent hotel in good location,Good city type hotel with generously sized rooms and good amenities. I miss opening windows though!!  Hotel staff good (rooftop bar excluded). Feel if the hotel bit corporate for my general feel. Breakfast good. ,4,2016,08,14
206,Great Hotel,"Great hotel, very helpful staff, room had everything you needed and more. Very clean and efficiently run hotel. Would easily recommend! Plenty of places around the hotel in walking distance; bars and restaurants and a theatre. Car park underground too.",4,2016,08,14
206,Top Class Hotel,Exceptional hotel and top quality service from staff. Upgraded room was absolutely superb with all the facilities required to chill out and relax. Location is ideal in a trendy part of the city and proximity to the Bord Gais Theatre is bonus.,5,2016,08,13
206,Beautiful Hotel in great location,"This is really stunning hotel, its light and airy and no expense has been spared in the decoration with wood, marble and glass being the main theme. The rooms are huge and the staff couldn't be more helpful.The hotel is situated in a quiet area on the attractive grand canal and is only a comfortable 10 minute walk from downtown Dublin. I'd definitely stay there again.",5,2016,08,13
206,Excellent hotel,An excellent hotel. Very trendy. Rooms are all very cool and the staff were super. Loved the rooftop bar which is definitely recommended if the weather is nice. A great location if you are going to the Bord Gais theatre but also a great spot if you just want to chill out in a really nice city centre hotel,5,2016,08,12
206,Exelent Hotel in Dublin,It was a great stay in Dublin. The Marker is an outstanding hotel with very good service. The rooms are trendy. A lot of space in the bathroom and a big comfortable shower. Very good breakfast. Also nice the bar. ,5,2016,08,12
206,Great Romantic Break,Great stay at a hotel worth its 5 star rating. Food & cocktails where excellent. Staff were more than helpful and very knowledgeable. My girlfriend loved the spa and treatments she had. Overall a fantastic experience,5,2016,08,11
206,Beautiful,The staff were fantastic! The hotel along with The room were just were spotless and clean. Could not recommend this place any more. Look forward to coming back to Dublin and staying here again!! Rooms are very comfortable ,5,2016,08,11
206,Height of luxury in Dublin,"I visited Dublin with my wife for the Dublin Half Marathon and decided to make a bit of a trip around Ireland whilst we were there. Had a look around Dublin for places to stay and this seemed to look good and was close to the start of the half marathon. What a great experience! We had hired a car at the airport and were greeted by the porter who took our bags in for us, introduced us to reception and then took our car to the car park. We were upgraded to king suite and our bags taken to the room.

The standard of customer service really was exceptional. Everyone was so friendly, smiling and ever so helpful. They genuinely seemed interested in our stay and what we were doing. It had a small hotel feel in a big hotel. The room was great. Clean, modern, comfortable and extremely quiet. You could hear no noise from outside or from the corridor and we both had an amazing nights sleep.

We ordered room service and our server, Chetan, was amazing. So friendly and attentive and the food was exceptional. On leaving even the car porter asked how i had got on with the half marathon! 

All in all I highly recommend this beautiful hotel with stunning views and fantastic location.",5,2016,08,11
206,Beautiful high end hotel,"We had a great one night stay at The Marker Hotel.  Very luxurious!  What a beautiful hotel in a great location.  Walking distance to city center.  We were traveling with our 4 kids and the hotel was very accommodating.   They made us feel welcome.  My husband and I went up to the rooftop bar, which is awesome.  Great service!  Breakfast was very good also.  We loved it even though it was only one night.",5,2016,08,11
206,Lovely SPA experience,"We went to the SPA as a day trip treat on a saturday. It was a really lovely experience, with very professional and friendly staff. 

The SPA is really lovely with a lot of attention to detail. And eventhough it was a weekend, the pool/sauna/steam room area was never over-filled. 

Very relaxing experience, even if a little pricey. Felt like a very luxurious retreat right in the city centre! ",5,2016,08,11
206,Fabulous experience.,"Fabulous hotel in a great location. 
Staff are very helpful and friendly.
For a 5 star the breakfast has only an okay selection. There is a surcharge for some dishes (like eggs benedict) which I think is inappropriate for a 5 star.
The food is the bar is lovely but the day was cold. The automatic door kept opening so we were freezing. ",5,2016,08,11
206,"Lovely Hotel, not really value for money",Service and staff excellent. ‚Ç¨389 for one night was very steep and did not include breakfast or dinner. Girl at reception said she would send something up to my 3year old daughter but never did. You don't really get much here for your money ,4,2016,08,11
206,Best weekend experience ever,"This hotel was the best hotel I ever had the pleasure to stay at. The attention paid to the need of clients is incredible. The staff at reception is not only listening to your requests very carefully, they also fulfil every single wish, even the ones you were not directly asking for. The timing of the room cleaning is perfect. The food is very well prepared and delicious. Staying at this hotel is a really wonderful experience.",5,2016,08,11
206,The marker hotel,trom the moment I walked in to the hotel I was greeted with nothing but respect and had the most pleasant check in / check out. The spa is truely amazing just a great hotel overall with lovely staff!!,5,2016,08,11
206,Modern luxurious hotel,"We chose the hotel because it met our criteria and seemed easier to find than some other city centre hotels we have been too and we weren't disappointed. We were coming from Dublin Port and it is on this side of the city. It was well signposted from Pearse Street.
There is valet parking so after taking out our luggage the car was whisked away. Our room was spacious and the bathroom was great with underfloor heating. The bed was large and really comfortable. The room temperature was so easy to control and very responsive so we could keep it quite cool. The only downside was a trace of a musty/damp smell as we entered the room but it wasn't apparent once in the room - just on entering the room this faint odour was a bit off putting.
We didn't eat in the hotel but we did use the bar - brilliant cocktails!
Every member of staff we had dealings with were helpful and friendly. Even the head chef who saw us looking at the tourist leaflets offered us some advice.",5,2016,08,11
206,Excellent stay,"The location on the docs of dublin is awesome. We liked the calm. As in the city was a lot of noise due to the working on the subway tracks.
The rooms are large and the bathroom to. The latter is equiped with the best amenities.
The service is alway nice, welcoming and warm. Every wish we had was accomplished in a minute without problems.
The food at the ""brasserie"" and at the bar is exquisit.
All in all: we loved it!
Thank you!",5,2016,08,11
206,Family night out,A truly special evening in this amazing hotel.  Our group of 4 enjoyed a 5 star meal followed by cocktails on the rooftop... wow. ..what an amazing experience on a beautiful summers evening.  Each member of staff was so welcoming and so friendly.  Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable and we thoroughly enjoyed the chef's special recommendation which was Goat..yum..a great venue for a meal before our trip to the theatre.,5,2016,08,10
206,Wonderful hotel in Dublin.,Oustanding service from the staff. Wonderful food. A bit pricey but definitely worth it. Pool and spa are definitely an oasis of peace and tranquility. I highly recommend the Marker for buiness or pleasure. Thank you for making our first trip to Dublin unforgettable.,5,2016,08,10
206,Class and style ,"Very beautiful hotel. 

Both in the lobby and in the rooms there is a sense of quality and style. 

Very rare for Dublin city hotels. 

The rooms are spacious with marble bathrooms. 

The restaurant offers a good variety and tasty dishes. 

Breakfast very good wave you can try  cronuts. 

Personnel very professional and friendly. ",5,2016,08,10
206,Best in Class Experience,"We stayed here from 7th to 9th August in room 2024 and it looked as though the hotel had just opened because everything is impeccable and appears brand new. There are no scuffs or stains or cracks or marks anywhere and I was very surprised to find it had been open 2.5 years. I have stayed in hotels which are as good and hotels which are different but not sure I have stayed in one which was better. Spend some time visiting the roof bar which gives an amazing view across Dublin and, although not all covered, reminds me of the Sky Gardens in London on Fenchurch Street.

The bed was first class, much better than usual TV, the bathroom was superb and I can not fault anything. The food was beautifully presented and in large portions and not sure how to describe the staff except highly motivated and customer focussed. Laura who served us on the roof bar and the following day in the main hotel is worthy of being mentioned in despatches and is a credit to the hotel.

What more can I say. Ten out of ten!",5,2016,08,10
206,weekend break in Dublin,"Fabulous hotel, rooms were very comfortable and superbly clean. the staff were very helpful, friendly aand genuinely wanted to help with anything. food was all lovely, the breakfast was exceptional, everyone should try the pancakes with map,e syrup, bacon and mixed fruits!  The cocktails are also a must to try",5,2016,08,10
206,Love this olace,"I've been backwards and forwards to Dublin for work a lot over the last 3-4 months and staying at The Marker makes my trip.  The rooms are modern, spacious with large comfy beds.  The service is consistently great from the doorman to the receptionists and bar staff, everyone has always been full of smiles and loveliness!  The swimming pool is smart and clean.  The location is really pretty - right the water (not sea) where they do wake boarding.  My only disappointment is when it's full and they can't fit me in ;-)",5,2016,08,09
206,Excellent!,"Everything about The Marker is superb:   the setting, the building and decor, the rooms, and especially the bathrooms!   I've never seen such a beautiful bathroom in a hotel!  Also, it was a nice touch to have a message greeting me by name displayed on the television when I arrived.   This is an exceptional hotel.",5,2016,08,09
206,The best kept secret in Dublin,"The Marker is the best hotel to stay at in Dublin. The pool, spa, the attentive staff and the terrific rooms all make for a great experience. I brought my family along during their summer vacation and they loved the Marker.",5,2016,08,09
206,Amazing Hotel in a Great Location for Business,"Everything about this hotel is stellar - the service, the rooms, the quality of staff, and I loved the gym as well.  I booked the Marker for business, but it's a great hotel all around.  The room and amenities are top-notch.  I would definitely book again on my next trip.",5,2016,08,09
206,Hen Party ,I stayed here on the 6th August for one night. Our group enjoyed the roof top bar with lovely cocktails and food! The rooms were lovely and staff attentitive. Little bit pricey though as our room was small no bath just shower. Overall lovely stay,5,2016,08,08
206,Perfect place for business travel,"I spent 3 weeks at The Marker Hotel during a training and I was very satisfied with the services, the staff and the atmosphere in the hotel. The location is also a very good one, with nice views. I kindly recommend it for business trips and also personal trips.",5,2016,08,08
206,Amazing mid week break,"Had the most relaxed break, everything about the place is top class
Worth every penny!! And will definitely be back
Staff were very attentive and made us feel very relaxed
Location is great and there was a great buzz in the area for a Thursday night",5,2016,08,07
206,A luxurious oasis in a bustling town,"A great location away from the city,  but close enough to enjoy a stroll in. Excellently placed for the bord gais theater. Super helpful staff,  decent sized rooms, cool pool and spa,  roof top bar a must!",4,2016,08,07
206,No bang for a lot of buck,"I write this merely moments after we check out so excuse me if this is all over the place. 
Beautiful hotel, nice room and a lovely location - but that's about where my praise ends. 
Where do I begin? Our trip was to celebrate my partners birthday, coupled with our engagement. My family called ahead (without my knowledge) to tell the hotel this to see of they could prepare a surprise - I only found this out as we check out from my family as there was no surprise (be it champagne or a little note or anything). Not a huge issue as I wasn't expecting anything anyway, but considering the price and the occasion on top of the rest of the disappointment it's a little sour. 
Anyway, we check in, I provide my debit card for the room which I am told is fine, and we can settle anything on checkout.
We are told about the rooftop bar (that it exists and is open til 11).
Up in the room, first thing I notice is a quiet thumping of bass. We are on the 6th floor, the rooftop bar is above. Its quiet but luckily my now fianc√© does not notice; I don't mention it as I don't want her to start listening for it. 
We have had a long exciting day, so decide to dress up and go for a drink in the rooftop bar to celebrate our engagement then return to the room a little later for some room service and to relax. 
So we dress up and get ready, walk over to the entrance of the rooftop bar around 8pm and are turned away as it is full and there is a 90 minute wait time. Wonderful, wish we had been told about this when we checked in, as I believe you can prebook. 
We go back to the room, get comfy and order room service. The room service arrives and it's excellent, the guy who brings it is a real nice guy and the food is delicious, we enjoy and cuddle up. Can I point out the bass from upstairs has got louder and has continued since we checked in at 4pm (my fianc√© has slight hearing issues and luckily still didn't notice). 
Anyway, around 10:30pm we receive a phone call from room service saying we have no card on file (provided one on check in). I ask if we can settle in the morning and are refused. He tells me he has to come up this moment and take the payment. At 10:30pm. On the night of our engagement. After being refused entry to one of the major attractions of this hotel. 
I put on some clothes and answer the door to pay a nice young lad who is obviously as uncomfortable asking me this as I am paying it. 
Anyway, we settle back in and carry on with our evening. 
The thumping bass from the rooftop bar stops around 11pm.
Around 1am some Americans return to their room as we are trying to sleep. This room as adjacent to ours and connected via a locked door, which offers almost 0 noise cancellation. I know this as I had to endure over an hour of nattering whilst the Olympics played loudly on the television, whilst my fianc√© slept soundly next to me (lucky for some). 

As we check out I am asked if I enjoyed my stay, I tried to keep a cool head and tell them it as ""ok"" as I did not want to have to rattle off my list of complaints in front of the girl who was supposed to have one of the best days of her life the day prior, which luckily was not dampened too much by the poor showing from this ¬£220+ a night hotel we had booked. 

I do apologise to this man that I could not give him this feedback in person as I feel me angrily ranting at him for 20 minutes whilst my fianc√© got more and more uncomfortable next to me would have surely been something to remember. 

Anyway let me sum up. 
Personal visit from room service at 10:30pm demanding payment. 
Denied entry to rooftop bar with no earlier indication that a booking was needed. 
Poorly soundproofed rooms. 

Plus a few other minor niggles. ",2,2016,08,07
206,Excellent service and amenities,"I've stayed at The Marker 4 times and the service is always outstanding.  The rooms are very nice with extremely comfortable beds.  The gym is well equipped with weight machines, free weights, cycling equipment, and running equipment.",5,2016,08,06
206,Excellent food and service from the restaurant crew,"I went to the restaurant for dinner and experienced excellent service by the manager Mark and his charming crew. They paid attention to the smallest details and made sure that I am feeling like home :-). The food and wine were absolutely exquisit. I would always recommend to try the restaurant and also the amazing rooftop bar when you have a chance. It is certainly the best location to experience design, modern architecture and the vibrant Grand Canal area.",5,2016,08,05
206,Excellent,"Really enjoy our 2 night stay and 4hours of Spa treatments, Restaurant food was amazing, would definitely recommend  to family and friends and will return in the near future, Staff was very friendly and  knowledgeable of hotel and surrounding areas ",5,2016,08,05
206,Excellent stay,"A very enjoyable stay at the Marker, staff really engaging and attentive but in no way intrusive. The rooms are large and very comfortable. The rooftop bar is a great experience. We had a wonderful stay and are looking forward to returning. ",5,2016,08,04
206,FABULOUS!,Great experience and very good support from recepition and all employee very nice and help oriented confortable place if you need help contact gabi and godfrey. i recomeand this place for stay and for my good experience,5,2016,08,04
206,Awesome experience,"Hotel staff may have been the nicest experience I have ever encountered.  Extremely pleasant and helpful from arrival to departure.  Location of the hotel was also close to many things to do in Dublin. 

Would stay here again in a heartbeat. ",5,2016,08,04
206,Great service and a nice hotel,I had several lunches at the marker and the service was always great and the food is good. They also have a nice spa with good massages and a swimming pool to relax before or after the treatment. I highly recommend to enjoy one of the treatments. ,4,2016,08,04
206,A pleasure!,"Staff were fantastic, the hotel is lovely and food and drinks were great. Spa area is really nice and hotel lives up to the photos. A little far out to walk for a night out In heels  but not outrageous and easily done in a taxi for less than ten euros. ",5,2016,08,03
206,Back again and will continue to stay there,"Just had my 10th visit to the Marker, duly noted by the wonderful Receptionist when I checked in! As always this hotel is amazing, great rooms, professional service in particular Stefan on Reception and Gabriel on the Bell Team. Quick overnight but I simply love this hotel.",5,2016,08,03
206,Wonderful Stay !,"Everything was superb.  Hotel location, facilities, room, breakfast, rooftop bar, concierge recommendation.  Highly recommended.
If you are seeking a first class experience in a very modern hotel in Dublin this is the place to go.",5,2016,08,03
206,Very nice,"We had a 2 night stay its an expensive hotel & you have to pay for parking that said the hotel is very modern & immaculately clean, our room was a good size & very comfortable the bathroom was lovely, in room free WiFi & decent TV channels, we didn't use the restaurant but the breakfast buffet was excellent and the rooftop terrace has beautiful views of Dublin, the City Center is a 15 min walk or a short taxi trip away with lots of great bars/music & restaurants. Can't fault this hotel staff were excellent.",4,2016,08,02
206,Ireland Trip.,I can say our trip was Impeccable and perfect. Everyone at the hotel was helpful in each and every aspect of any request we made. The food in the restaurant was delicious and presented beautifully. The cleanliness of our room left us very happy. Our every wish seemed to be anticipated. The staff went out of their way to assist us,5,2016,08,02
206,Night away with my sisters,We stayed at the Marker to celebrate my sister's birthday. From start to finish we really enjoyed our stay. The Hotel is top class without being stuffy & every member of staff was extremely courteous & helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. We would definitely recommend the Hotel & will return!,5,2016,08,02
206,FABULOUS!,"You can never really tell until you experience it for yourself but this was literally the best hotel experience. Everyone was so helpful and friendly, the room was spotless, bathroom was beautiful, the little welcome treat was a nice touch...I can't say enough great things about this place. We wanted to stay there forever haha",5,2016,08,02
206,5 star luxury epitomised,"The Marker Hotel is so deserving of their 5 star rating...An absolutely gorgeous hotel with fantastic staff!..They were so accommodating,helpful and really made you feel like you were special!..The facilities are also fantastic-The gym is so well equipped and the pool facilities are so relaxing and luxurious!...The rooms are also beautifully decorated and the bathrooms are stunning..thoroughly enjoyed my stay and I will definitely be back!",5,2016,08,02
206,Small touches,Complimentary room upgrade and 'welcome back' desert which turned out to be the nicest thing I've eaten at 3am in the morning after a summer work night out and a burger king. What differentiates the Marker from other hotels - the small touches.,5,2016,08,02
206,Overnight stay,"The shower in our room went from scalding hot, to freezing cold twice during the one shower. At dinner my friends steak was over cooked, when she asked for rare - medium. Rather than being offered a replacement, we were given a complimentary glass of wine, not even the same wine we were drinking. It wasn't nice, so we didn't drink it.  We also overheard another couple complaining about their dinner. We were the only 4 people eating in the restaurant. No excuse. Unacceptable in a 5 star hotel.",2,2016,08,02
206,"Great hotel for a romantic weekend, but make sure you don't get put in a twin room :)","The hotel is very new and is flawless.  It's located in the Dublin docklands, a fair walk from the city centre but there are lots of restaurants, cafes etc in the same area.  A plus, for us, was that the hotel is on (or very near to) the routes used by both airport express buses (747 and 757).  Thirty minutes through the new tunnel was way better than a stop-start trip by taxi.

The rooms are modern, perhaps a little bland, but contained everything I expect to find in a hotel - room safe big enough for a laptop; big bath; efficient shower ...  The wi-fi was free and fast.  The only mark against it was that, having requested a 'Superior King' room, confirmed by e-mail, not just 'best endeavours' we found ourselves in a twin room.  Neither of us is large and we tend to gravitate together anyway so it wasn't a major issue but it might be worth contacting the hotel before you arrive to emphasise your requirements if it is important to you that you have a king size bed.

The hotel spa was also new, and also flawless.  The pool is long enough to do laps while the jacuzzi was big and hot.  Sauna and steam room were great.  We didn't try the treatments but, if they matched the facilities, they'd have been great too.

We were in Dublin to see Dublin so didn't try the restaurant but we did use the cocktail lounges in the lobby and on the rooftop terrace.  The drinks were excellent, if a little pricey and the staff very attentive, which was welcome as both venues were very busy over the weekend.",5,2016,08,02
206,Weekend break in the Marker,"Service was amazing. Allocated a room with a view and the bathrooms are stunning. Loved the hallways. V quiet and peaceful. Small bit of confusion regarding the use of the lifts.
 Bottle of champagne waiting for us as it was my friends birthday so v impressed. Great location. Excellent staff.",5,2016,08,02
206,Perfect,"A wonderful hotel, pretty pricy, but worth it.    Fantastic restaurant (""Brassiery""?) too.  Best meal I'd had in a while, tempura ling followed by lamb to die for.  Great French sparkling non-Champagne wine.  Lovely staff. Smart, but relaxed. Perfect.  Our room had a bit of a view over the quay which was nice (5th floor), but not spectacular.  Liffy view may be better if there is one!?  Room was spacious and a great bathroom/ wet room with bath and separate shower.  A little limited with the number of biscuits!!  ...but that was OK with fought for them and I was the bigger of the two :-)  I couldn't really work out what was mini-bar and what was complimentary either so aside from a tea bag and biscuit I didn't touch anything.  Not because I'm tight, but I wasn't sure I would remember what I had taken and that can be embarrassing at check-out!
Wifi was not just free, but seemed really great!  Better than at my home and that is pretty unusual for a hotel.... it seems petty... but that is a real plus to me. 
It's not BANG in the centre, but RIGHT next to a huge great theatre? 10 mins brisk walk from the conference centre and about 20 mins from the (dreadfully rowdy) O'Connell street.  Nice.
Said enough?  If you have the cash, pick this one!",5,2016,08,02
206,Top Marks,"Great service, food, drinks and ambience. Top quality stay which really didn't disappoint in any way-just awesome! We arrived during a very busy bank holiday weekend with Barcelona Football Club staying there. All was perfect after KLam ironed out a few minor niggles.",5,2016,08,02
206,Impressed ,"The staff really make you welcome when you arrive at the Marker hotel. I have stayed here twice, enjoyed cocktails on the rooftop bar with friends and relaxed in the pool area. Came away feeling so good and really enjoyed the experience!  ",5,2016,08,01
206,Great luxury,Arrived at the hotel tired and stressed after deciding not to stay at the airbnb I had booked in Marks Alley West because of the location and apartment entrance. So although paying twice for rooms this was delightful. Expensive to eat and drink at the hotel but easy to find other places near by. Room large and staff very helpful. A great service and great facilities. Ended my stay with my aunt on a real high note.,5,2016,08,01
206,Modern Hotel that slides into Ancient Dublin.,"Service is exceptional. Cannot fault them even if you try. Were checked in early. Large spacious rooms, heated floor bathroom with good turn down service. Full of young working people and has an amazing roof top bar. The restaurant is good.
Its a 20 minute walk to the center of town and that may be a plus. Its on the canal and highly recommended for people on work. We were on vacation and i would stay there again.",4,2016,08,01
206,"If I return to Dublin, that's where.","The Marker is a Leading Hotels of the World establishment. Unlike other such hotels (see other reviews of mine) it fully lives up to the expectations. I was only ther for one night so I did not check out the whole infrastructure, but what I saw is what I was looking for. Nice and modern luxury, spot on service, a good breakfast with local products. Thos is my hotel in Dublin.",5,2016,08,01
206,Great Hotel and Location,This was our first visit to Ireland and this was our first stop on our tour.  We enjoyed Dublin but the hotel and staff made our stay that much better.  We very much liked to Marker Hotel and it was a great location,5,2016,08,01
206,Nice rooms but terrible service - DO NOT STAY HERE,"On 23 July they accepted our reservation for three nights to start 27 July.  When we arrived they had us go to another hotel, The Dylan - which i highly recommend.  We had been traveling changing rooms for 3 nights already and were looking forward to establishing a base for several nights.  This did not happen.  I had to pay taxi fare to go to and from the hotel or wait over an hour for their car.   They clearly ""traded"" the hotel room as I saw the bill from the Dylan which was 160 Euros cheaper than our room rate.  Did they discount the room for us?  No.  Did they discount our ruined spa treatments?  No.  They sent some crappy bottle of sparkling wine to the room when we arrived.  This was not good enough.  I faced additional costs of more than 100 Euros because of them and it ruined our spa treatments as we had to rush to them in the morning and did not have a chance to truly relax.  Another 500 Euros down the drain.  Not to mention my pissed off spouse.  We also booked this hotel to use the rooftop bar which was closed for a private event.  The Westin if you want to be in the middle of it all or The Dylan if you are looking for a quiet location.  Avoid these guys like the plague.",1,2016,08,01
206,Good hotel but bad food.,"Hotel with good: rooms, views and service. However, the main attraction in summer time, the rooftop bar is often closed. 
Also, we couldn't recommend dining here as the menu is poor. 
We were served half cooked half raw lobster!",3,2016,08,01
206,Very pleasant experience,"The service is great, the employees are very helpful and polite and that matters the most for me when staying in a hotel. Great experience overall and I would recommend it. Hope to get the chance to book a room here again!",5,2016,08,01
206,The best hotel in Dublin,We had the pleasure of staying at the Marker Hotel when we were in Dublin 3 weeks ago.  The hotel rooms are lovely but the big plus is the hotel staff headed up (when we were there) by Assistant Manager Liam.  The hotel is very client service oriented.  The very few minor difficulties involving accessing the front desk in the evening were dealt with effectively and quickly and one got the impression that everyone at the hotel was working very hard to make everything the very best it could be.  Our experience there made us feel like valued clients and we would certainly stay there again should we return to Dublin.,5,2016,07,31
206,Nothing is too much trouble,"The Marker hotel is ideally located in the Dock area of Dublin and all around is well defined and good to look at. Short walks around the local vicinity is encouraged. As for the hotel itself, decor, accommodation, food and drink is of the highest order and the staff cannot do enough for you - from reception, to spa, to cleaner to concierge - the customer is clearly at the forefront of everything they do.

I have now used ALL the facilities, having stayed a few times in the last few months, and would highly recommend it for business and pleasure!",5,2016,07,31
206,Not sure you quite get what you pay for..,"Spent an evening at the Marker with three other couples. Arrive and checked in earlier than the men and as expected rooms were not ready but assured all would be ready for official check in. Arrived back at hotel at 5 and told that one room was still not ready but a complimentary drink and sandwich was to be offered. Ordered and then sat and waited and waited and waited. An hour later and after waiting for some more drinks for a long time a member of the party summoned the manager... Drinks for the group were given on the house the couple waiting for the room was upgraded and we were told that we would receive free drinks all evening on the roof terrace for the inconvenience. As expected we were all more than happy with this. Then we discovered two of the four had been given the wrong rooms. After three drinks on the terrace we were told that was it stopped because the bill was too high, don't offer if not going to follow through was the general consensus of the group. Breakfast buffet was stone cold and on check out car parking had been incorrectly assigned to the wrong rooms. The hotel and rooms are gorgeous but for the price tag id expect the overall service to be just a little bit more slick. Won't return.",4,2016,07,31
206,Excellent hotel,"I've stayed at the Marker twice and it's really good, probably the best hotel in Dublin. It has everything you can ask for. The location is great. It's clean, the service is great. 
I very much recommend it.",5,2016,07,31
206,Staying at Irelamd,"Somewhat expensive considering facilities and location. 20minutes from center of Dublin by walk.
Breakfast also expensive.  Near hotel some cafes and morning sandwich store was good enough to breakfast.
You have to prepare your own swimming suits and trainning suits to use the swimming pool or gym. ",3,2016,07,31
206,Great Hotel!,"I recently spent ten nights at The Marker Hotel and if I am ever in the area in the future, I will definitely stay there again. It is located in the Grand Canal area and my room overlooked both the canal and the Bord Theatre across the street. 

From the hotel, you can walk everywhere if you like to walk! From the hotel, I walked to Temple Bar, Trinity College, The Guinness Storehouse, St.Patrick's Cathedral, St. Stephen's Green, Croke Park, UCD and everywhere in between!

The hotel itself is beautiful, clean, safe and well staffed. I wish I could remember the names of all that helped me throughout my stay as they were all awesome! From the staff at my breakfast each morning, to the folks at the spa where I swam, to the staff working the evening shift. All were fabulous! The housekeeping staff was also wonderful!

",5,2016,07,29
206,Shame about roof top bar being closed,primary reason for booking the hotel was the roof top bar - which upon arrival was closed. we were told that is normally the case on a Monday and Tuesday - which is simply not accepatble especially as the evening tepm was 25+,4,2016,07,29
206,Best service ever!,"This hotel is beautiful, which is amazing but beyond that it is run with a service first approach.  Everybody is helpful, quick, professional, polite, and just generally pleasant to deal with.  I cannot complain about one thing. ",5,2016,07,28
206,Great Hotel in Dublin,"I stayed at The Marker Hotel for three nights in July 2016.  The service was 5-star.  The staff are very accommodating and friendly.  Unless you want to be in the touristy area of Temple Bar, the location is great.  It is located in a financial/business district. It is in a picturesque, quiet area that is an easy 15 minute walk to the Temple Bar area.  In the immediate vicinity of the hotel, there are a few restaurants w/ outside seating.  My room was clean and sufficient in size.  I have no complaints at all regarding this hotel nor its location.  I highly recommend it to anyone that doesn't mind walking a short distance to tourist attractions.",5,2016,07,28
206,Best hotel I have ever stayed in,I can't complain about anything.  Staff was awesome. Food was great but I am simple when it comes to food and some was above my level of interest.  The rooftop bar was my favorite. The service is top notch.,5,2016,07,27
206,Great hotel!,Loved this hotel!!  It was a top quality hotel all around.  The room was beautiful and so comfortable.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is traveling to Dublin and I would definitely stay here again!,5,2016,07,27
206,"Fabulous Hotel, the best in Dublin",We stayed in the Marker Hotel for a night back in May of this year. What can I say from the minute we arrived the guy that parked my car to the check in staff this hotel is fabulous. Staff are very friendly and can not do enough for you during your stay I forgot my lipstick in my car and one of the concierge staff got it for me and delivered it to my room. The food is exceptional and the roof top bar is gorgeous. I love love love this hotel so much so I'm going back on Sunday for a night of luxury at its best...,5,2016,07,27
206,Luxury ,"My husband and I booked in for a 2 night stay on Monday and were informed that we had received an upgrade to a corner suite ! What a great way to start. The corner suite has fabulous views and is really an apartment in size. 
The choice of food at breakfast  , especially the fruit, was better than any hotel that I have been in before. 
The staff were polite and friendly at all times.
The location was fantastic 
We will definitely be back :) ",5,2016,07,27
206,Luxury hotel in a great location,"The location facing Grand Canal square is excellent . It is however about a 15 minute walk from the town centre ( Grafton Street , Temple Bar etc) . We had a corner suite with a lovely view over the Grand Canal . It is worth the extra charge. ( we were offered an upgrade from a regular room for 80 euro ) .
The service was excellent ( we found this wherever we went in Ireland ) . The Rooftop Bar has stunning views and is worth visiting even if you don't stay here . ",5,2016,07,26
206,Just go and stay here. staff exceed in every way.....,A wedding anniversary that will always be remembered. All the staff from check in to the spa to the skybar and the guys who look after your car they are all extremely friendly and professional. The guest relations manager Hajnalka  is the best we have ever dealt with such a pleasure to talk with and extremely friendly. She really spoiled us with some champagne in the room! I cannot wait to get back to this hotel. ,5,2016,07,26
206,Modern luxury hotel,"We stayed at this trendy luxury hotel during our weekend trip to Dublin, and enjoyed every minute. Many tourist attractions and the city centre are within walking distance, and the hop-on hop-off bus stops around the corner. Staff are very friendly and efficient. Try the pool and gym, and go to the rooftop bar for cocktails.",5,2016,07,26
206,great hotel.,"Great hotel, great service, big and nice room.
The room is clean and big, and stylish. 
The lady in reception and the gentleman in concierge are so nice, they know about the city and the hotel very well, answers all our questions, and make us feel so warm.   ",5,2016,07,26
206,NA,"I stayed there since it was recommended due to the location is within walking distance to the office.  Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to try the spa/pool and rooftop, therefore I cannot comment further.  ",3,2016,07,25
206,A Weekend Break,"My partner and I really enjoyed our stay at The Marker Hotel.We regularly visit The Marker Hotel in our spare time for drinks and food so we decided to book a nights stay here which was a great experience.The hotel is very modern and staff provide great service.We would like to mention Derek who works on The Roof Top Bar.He was extremely welcoming and very helpful.He answered many questions we had in relation to holding a party in the near future up there.It was clear to see he really enjoys his job , is very hardworking and a credit to his team.We will defiantly be booking another nights stay with The Marker Hotel soon.",5,2016,07,25
206,Excellent ,"I love the marker hotel it was my second time to stay here and it never disappoints. The staff are really friendly and attentive and nothing seems to be a problem for them . They have a fantastic rooftop bar that has cocktails to die for ,I recommend u book a table , it can get quite busy so it would be a shame if u stayed in the hotel without getting to visit this bar . The food is spectacular and breakfast in particular was amazing . ",5,2016,07,25
206,Obsessed with the bathroom!,"The hotel was amazing, I was staying for a conference so didn't get a chance to really experience the facilities available but was really impressed with the room.

Loved the bathroom, it was so huge - had both a large shower and a large bath. Really regret not getting the time to relax here a but longer.",5,2016,07,25
206,Very stylish hotel,"We stay at the Marker in Dublin almost every time we visit the city. It is a smart, very well equipped hotel with amazingly friendly staff.
The rooms are big and spacious with a simple but stylish interior. Amazing bathrooms all decorated with lovely Carrara marble tiles.
The hotel has a very good and new gym, lovely pool/ spa area. The bar at the reception area is stylish and very busy during the weekend. There is a lovely roof top bar where you can enjoy a drink overlooking at the Dublin view.
But the cherry on the cake if this hotel is the staff. Very friendly, attentive and helpful.
I would recommend to stay in this hotel if you are visiting the city as much as if you are over for business.
The Grand Canal area is vibrant and full of nice restaurants and bar as much as been just 15 minutes walking distance from the city Centre.
The only downside there is no parking within we hotel. You will have to pay for a hotel fee public parking.",4,2016,07,25
206,Marker hits the mark,Amazing hotel in a perfect location with nice views. Rooms were lovely and spacious with modern d√©cor. Bathroom was big and had everything needed. We had breakfast which was fabulous and everything you could imagine was on offer. Would definitely stay there again.,5,2016,07,25
206,we would return to Dublin just to stay here,"Usually i don't write reviews but this hotel made me write a review at this stage.
This hotel has it all. Fantastic location, excellent service, comfortable beds, gorgeous rooms, a great bar, and atmosphere. We only stayed one night, which I regret. My self and my husband,We disembarked from a cruise so we arrived early in the morning and our room was not available, which we expected. We stored our bags and we decide to have a drink at the bar.
The bar is beautiful and airy, the staff is fabulous,service is friendly and attentive,our bartender Christian couldn't do enough for us,at his suggestion i we had the best cocktails ever,food at the bar was excellent to,were both treated like Royalty.
We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,07,25
206,Lovely Hotel and Perfect Location!,"Just returned home to the States after a 5 night stay in Dublin.  My sister selected this hotel after a lot of research and it couldn't have been a better choice.  Tucked between the Grand Canal and Liffey River and just blocks from the history, beauty and excitement of downtown, this is the ideal location for nighttime and daytime strolls. The hotel, itself, was beautiful and the staff pleasant and helpful.  We were both extremely happy with our stay!",5,2016,07,24
206,5 Days in Dublin,"Recently returned from a 5 day stay at The Marker Hotel Dublin. I usually don't stay in these higher-end accommodations, I am more of a budget traveler, however I was able to get a free stay through a family member who was in Dublin on business. With that being said the hotel is very nice, I can't complain about it at all. The rooms were spacious, comfortable and always cleaned every day to the highest standards. The rooftop lounge was cool, luckily the weather was amazing and we were able to use it. The location was great, right outside a very nice square/park area by the water, a few shops, bars and restaurants close by. There is a little grocery place that serves fresh sandwiches with your choice of toppings, I would highly recommend the $4 sandwich over the $25 breakfast buffet, if you could even call it a buffet. I've had better breakfast in a Holiday Inn. 

Now the reason why I didn't rate it 5/5 is because of the overall atmosphere in the hotel. Now I get these higher-end hotels draw a more affluent crowd but I have never seen a lobby bar, or the roof top lounge for that matter, be so boring. Compared to other hotel bars in Dublin this one is seriously lacking character, and not because of the bar itself but because of the type of people staying in these higher-end hotels. 

I'm glad I got to stay in what is arguably one of the best hotels in Dublin, however I would prefer to go to a lower budget hotel with a better atmosphere which makes mingling with people a lot easier. Just my opinion really, but if you like high end luxury and posh accommodations I would highly recommend this place.",4,2016,07,23
206,Amazing staff and amazing hotel!,Recently visited this fabulous hotel when going to the Dublin Horse Show. The attention to detail from all staff and service you receive at this hotel is second to none! Highly recommend this beautiful hotel for a great experience! Also highly recommend the cocktails in the roof top bar! ,5,2016,07,23
206,lovely luxury hotel,"Luxury hotel, really nice location within walking distance of city centre, the spa/pool and rooftop bar are really nice . book early to get a table at the rooftop bar it is in great demand. really nice. And they have the most wonderful staff!! ",5,2016,07,23
206,The best in Dublin,"Having stayed with Hilton and Marriot group hotels, I would rate marker the best in Dublin - be it for for business or for a family stay . It is right in the city Center and has got great accessibility to all the prime locations in Dublin ",5,2016,07,23
206,Outstanding guest experience,"An impeccable guest experience in a smart, contemporary environment with a great location. Stayed for two nights as a family of four and despite the hotel catering more for business travelers, the experience was exemplary with the wonderful staff going out of the way to make our two little ones feel at home (from delivering glasses of milk to the bedroom on arrival to making the very snazzy pool available during certain hours of the day). Excellent food (both restaurant and room service) too. But the staff: what a professionally-run outfit it was. If there was one gripe it's that the rooms did not have the greatest storage options, especially for a family of four. ",5,2016,07,23
206,Excellent hotel in Dublin,"Excellent hotel, perhaps the best breakfast I have ever had. Selection of healthy choices. 
The weather was unusually goog for Dublin and Rooftop bar open. What a view there! One should go there just for a view. ",5,2016,07,23
206,"Good location, good facilities","I used to live just around the corner from here; interesting to see how the area's developed. First off it's handy for the Airlink Express which zips through the port tunnel.

At the hotel, check-in was good, room good, breakfast good. The pool's worth a visit.",4,2016,07,22
206,Great ,"Went here for my mini-moon 
Staff went above and beyond to be so helpful ! 
Rooms spotless & room very spacious !
Bathroom was beautiful 
Didn't have breakfast so can't comment on the food but drinks on the rooftop bar was a huge highlight of our trip 
Pool and jacuzzi was lovely 
Would stay again ",5,2016,07,22
206,Great taste of Irish Hospitality,"Had a perfect stay at the hotel.  Staff was very welcoming and friendly and went above and beyond to make us feel at home.  Accommodations were very comfortable, spa / pool was great.  Overall a very very nice hotel that deserves to do well.  ",5,2016,07,21
206,Modern Luxury - more business than charm & romance,"An ideal location, away from the madding crowds yet still close enough that a 15 minute walk lands you right in the heart of Temple.. 

Modern sophisticated look, great breakfast buffet & spacious rooms with excellent amenities in the bathroom. The rooftop bar offers great views, though get there early to avoid having to wait to go up as seating limited. 

It's certainly worth 5 stars as it delivers on all its promises & the staff are a credit. ",5,2016,07,20
206,Fabulous luxury escape,"Luxury hotel, easy walking distance to city centre. Rooftop bar a joy as was the pool. Best sleep in the very comfortable bed and large room. Really enjoyed the pot of tea on arrival. Great staff and service. ",5,2016,07,20
206,Highly recommended,"A huge thank you to Barry, Gabriel, and the rest of the staff at The Marker! Barry especially helped us each morning by listening to our plans and suggesting great locations, restaurants, and pubs to visit while out for the day. The view from our room and the rooftop bar was incredible. It's also in a great location in Dublin making it very easy to get around to all the tourist attractions. This was the best stay my wife and I have ever had at a hotel. Cheers! Hope to visit again soon",5,2016,07,20
206,Very nice hotel,"Everything about the hotel is nice, bedroom was spacious with lovely views, breakfast was nice and staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooftop bar had brilliant views and cocktails were amazing. We visited the spa and had a massage which was very good and carried out by professional staff. The pool area wasn't anything special but for a city centre hotel it was grand.
So why only 4*...for me it lacked the wow of a 5*...everything was nice and for the money you pay it may not be best value. I've had as pleasant a stay at many other hotels that were not 5*. We did have a great few days, would I recommend the hotel...yes but would I return for a second visit...not likely, would probably try somewhere else.",4,2016,07,20
206,Top Marks For The Marker,"Wonderful hotel in a great location overlooking the Docklands, also just a short walk away from the bustling city centre which was approximately a 15 minute walk - great for getting those steps in! 
The staff were attentive throughout and extremely welcoming. All facilities clean and the rooms were immaculate and comfortable. 
What really pleased me was the rooftop bar! I love a rooftop bar! Albeit a little windy on our visit, still thoroughly enjoyed. 
Room service was also fast to arrive. ",5,2016,07,20
206,"Huge Rooms, gorgeous bathroom!","I tagged along one of  my husbands travel trips to Dublin and we had the opportunity to stay at The Marker. Upon arrival, we were graciously greeted by a kind bellman who was very friendly. The first arrival sets the tone for the ambiance of the hotel and I could tell it was going to be a pleasant stay. The room was very modern and clean. I really appreciated having such a huge bathroom since many bathrooms in Europe are tiny. It had a huge bath, stand in shower, and his and her sinks. Plenty of room for two people to walk around in. We got a room with an amazing view of the docks. This location was prime to my husband's job which was less than 500 feet away. On mornings when he was gone for work, I would roam around Dublin and noticed many places were walkable like bars and restaurants. If you actually wanted to go into town more and go near the Jamerson Distillery than I would recommend a taxi.",5,2016,07,19
206,Nice hotel but terrible HVAC system,This could have been a good hotel except for the HVAC which was not working. Hotel staff basically ignored our complaints until we spoke to the night manager who eventually moved our room.  They tried to put a fan in our room which did nothing except make noise. Once we moved rooms on the second night it was ok but not great. ,3,2016,07,19
206,Second Stay. Levels above other 5*,"Just had the most enjoyable stay in the marker. Spent 5 hours on the rooftop bar, where I had got engaged 6 months previous. The hotel remembered us and immediatly sent over 2 glasses of champagne android us it was great to have us back. Derek (rooftop concierge) had an amazing gift for welcoming and makes you feel like a million dollars throughout your stay. Johnny (bar) makes the best cocktails I have ever tasted with the finest ingredients. There are so many to choose from (30+) and it doesn't matter what you order as they are all exceptional, but you will receive 5* guidance when ordering. 

The best thing about this hotel is the standard of ALL staff. Yair (food and beverages manager) will always make the effort to come and introduce himself and ensure that everything is top drawer, even the executive chef took the time to introduce himself and give us a briefing about the hotel and menu. 

And when you stay here, anything is possible. Beyonce was playing in Dublin that night and at 12 o'clock there was a great buzz as a rumour started that she was staying in the hotel, 5 minutes later her dancers all walked in with their concert passed around there neck.

This hotel will always be special to us and we cannot wait to return. ",5,2016,07,19
206,Beautiful Hotel,"Had a wonderful stay here, was only for one night but the staff couldn't have been more helpful. The room was stunning with a beautiful view, bed was so comfortable, shower was amazing. Can't rate this place enough, 10/10 ",5,2016,07,19
206,A great week end away.,"This lovely hotel is in the very nice location of docklands, an area of Dublin that has seen considerable improvement. The hotel is modern with an air of calm luxury and is well situated for visiting the sites of Dublin. The open top hop-on hop-off site seeing bus stops almost next to the hotel and is very good value. This 5* hotel is a ideally placed for a visit to Dublin and is everything a 5* hotel should be, quiet, comfortable and gives easy access to Dublin and all it's attractions. ",5,2016,07,19
206,"Beautiful Hotel, Rooms are warm.","The rooms and amenities are beautiful, the only problem was with the rooms air conditioning. It was warm even tough it was cool outside. It would have been nice to be able to open a window since the hotel HVAC system is inadequate.",4,2016,07,19
206,Fine tuning required,Alot of good but check in was painful and requesting certain newspapers a nightmare even if they are locally printed. The main bar is also a little strange in that it feels like you are sat in reception. Overall a pleasant stay with nice rooms and the breakfast staff were fantastic ,3,2016,07,19
206,Weekend Romantic Stay,"Rooms are OK in size not huge with all the items your require.  Nice Coffee.  Absolutely beautiful Bathroom.  Breakfast fit for a king and staff excellant with attention to detail.  Bar in the evening very busy but with seats still available and a very nice atmosphere.
We'll be back !! ",5,2016,07,18
206,Dublin,"Great location of you want peace and quiet. Beautiful canal view and view of commons area in old gas district. It's a walk to city center but easy 10 minute cab ride to just about anywhere.
There are some local pubs and a small grocery store. The staff is wonderful 
Service is impressive ",4,2016,07,18
206,Business week stay,"The service and stuff were great, the spa and rooftop bar are very nice extras, food was very good. Issues with accepting the swipe and sign kind of credit card, hope they're able to fix that for the future.",4,2016,07,18
206,sublime,"superb stay,  my new favourite dublin destination! friendly,helpful staff who really can't do enough without being intrusive. 
spectacular interior design- fresh & crisp.
Amazing views of Dublin. Great vibe! I really can't recommend this hotel highly enough. ",5,2016,07,18
206,Fine hotel to stay in Dublin,"Nice and modern hotel with spacious bathroom. 

The room electrical outlet accepts UK, US and EU style plugs. The provide bottle drinking water but no refrigerator. 

You may want to bring your own slippers. I could not locate CNN channel on the TV

Nice surrounding areas, with pleasant seatings in the front of the hotel. You may want to request for room with Water Front view. Dublin is beautiful and this is a good chance to its beautiful views from a fine hotel.

The services were good.
",4,2016,07,17
206,A fantastic hotel!,"This is a fantastic hotel in every respect.  The buffet breakfast was spectacular, the rooms modern and with all the amenities you would want, the service was professional and courteous, the gym was first-class and all in an excellent location!  We didn't have a chance to use the pool or have a drink on the rooftop patio, but I'm sure they were excellent too!  Highly recommended!!",5,2016,07,17
206,Conference in Dublin,"Fantastic hotel with the most helpful staff you will ever meet. Lovely rooms, facilities top-notch, great location. The spa pool is so relaxing after a hard day's study! I would definitely return to stay again. ",5,2016,07,17
206,Lovely hotel,"This hotel is well placed for visitors to Dublin. The staff our very helpful and friendly. The rooms are a good size with comfortable chairs and beds.
The bar area on the main floor is a great place to sit and read, have a drink, or meet friends. It is accessible all day so is an alternative area to spend time out of the room if one do desires. The wait staff are quick to serve, but are unobtrusive if one wishes to just read or check email.",5,2016,07,17
206,Another lovely stay!,"Lovely, modern hotel with excellent service and comfortable rooms. Bathroom is very well equipped and the Brasserie food is a treat! Breakfast is also good. Already looking forward to my next stay here.",5,2016,07,17
206,Hen party/shopping/spa weekend,"Welcomed to the hotel like long lost friends! Beautiful rooms, very modern clean and comfortable! Gorgeous spa! Treatments on the expensive side but worth it, super friendly staff really relaxed from the first minute we stepped into our fluffy gowns.",5,2016,07,17
206,Exceptional in Everything ,"Stayed here June 16 for 4 nights when at a conference in Dublin. This hotel is exceptional in every sense. The comfort of the rooms and beds, the luxurious bathrooms and gothic swim pool! The service was courteous and it is located by the river front in central Dublin. ",5,2016,07,15
206,Our savior,"After we had been completely neglected by Paddywagon Tours, we (two couples) sought some salvation for our time in Dublin. We turned to Liam, the manager of the Marker hotel where 2 of us had stayed. He spent a lot of time securing us a qualified taxi driver/guide who then took us for a  hour tour. We are grateful to Liam for his professionalism and care.",5,2016,07,15
206,2 Days in Dublin,Very trendy nice well located Hotel fairly close to everything we wanted to see and staff were beyond helpful! The AC was not working very well 1st night but was repaired next day so were much more comfortable. The Main floor Bar was great value with great service staff! ,4,2016,07,15
206,Fabulous hotel on every level in the Dublin Docklands,"I have been to this hotel many times and have been meaning to write a review so here goes.
The Marker really lives up to the 5 stars - it's a very slick operation and extremely well run hotel. I have eaten here many times in the bar, once in the restaurant and also had the famous 'Le Drunch' The food has always been really good and priced reasonably aswell. Delicious desserts and just a really good choice for all . The drinks menu is very extensive and they do an amazing cocktail list!
It is a very clean, modern setting so if you are looking for old world then this isn't the hotel but it is perfectly matched to it's surroundings in the very cool Dublin Docklands area. 
The staff are in one word superb. Uber professional and always so friendly and helpful but not over the top. The Food & Beverage team are first class and you can tell they are very experienced and know what they are doing. The chef there is a regular on TV in Ireland and I am a big fan.
The spa is fantastic, amazing range of treatments and superb facilities and seriously relaxing. I was there on a corporate outing and we loved it. Again the staff are brilliant. Well done!
The Marker rooftop bar is already famous in Dublin - if you can grab a table it's a must when in Dublin - the views are amazing and you won't find a bar like it. 
I have stayed here once aswell and the rooms are excellent quality and kept to a high standard.
The Marker Hotel, for me, lives up to it's 5 stars and you will want to return 100%.
If you are coming to Dublin and want to stay in a cool area then this is for you.
I am a big Marker fan!",5,2016,07,15
206,Great Surprise In Dublin,"Finding a modern, high-end hotel in Dublin was no easy task. After much research online, I came across The Marker Hotel. While looking at photos online, I instantly loved the sleek design of the hotel and style of the rooms. Once we arrived, I was equally impressed. Arrival at the hotel was seamless, as the doormen greeted us and quickly had our bags collected for delivery. Ciara at the front desk was delightful! We arrived before check-in time, after a long flight from the US, and she needed a few minutes to check to see if a room was ready. She made us comfortable in the lobby while she looked into it. Turns out the room was ready, and we were quickly escorted to the Schwartz Suite. 

Wow! What a suite this was! The entry-way led to a large bedroom to the left and a huge living space to the right, with floor-to-ceiling windows of the Grand Canal area. A box of cronuts awaited us, and soon, some welcome macarons were delivered. What a great experience this was! We settled into the room, and took nice long showers after so many hours of traveling. The bathroom was compact, yet was chic and modern, and had any amenity we could ask for. There is also a separate powder room next door. 

We had one dinner and two breakfasts in the hotel's restaurant. All three times, service and food were excellent! 

The hotel is located quite a way from the center of Dublin - about a 25 minute walk. However, we enjoy getting our exercise and didn't mind walking into the city center a couple of times a day. The Grand Canal area is also great just to hang out and relax - I did a long run in this area as well.

We had such a nice stay here. If in Dublin again, we will most definitely look into staying at The Marker again. And a big thanks to Ciara and Stephen, the manager, who were so kind and caring looking after us for a few days.",5,2016,07,15
206,Truly 5 star hotel ,"Attention to detail ... Outstanding !! Fab roof garden . Stayed there for Beyonc√© concert & all the band & dancers & crew were there . The sun shone , it was classier than the south of France& the staff made it üëå. Well done Marker . Best hotel in Dublin !!! ",5,2016,07,14
206,Fantastic Dublin Break!,"Just back from a brilliant weekend at The Marker. This is a beautiful luxury hotel in the docks, about 15 minutes walk from the city and Temple bar area. Breakfast was wonderful, lots of choice. Staff were so friendly and helpful. Our room was not ready at 3.20pm when we checked in so our spirits were a little dampened as we had planned to meet friends at 4pm, however the manager offered us a complimentary beverage while we waited and advised he would check to see if a suite was available to upgrade us to for the inconvenience caused. We were upgraded to a corner suite which was lovely.
The car park is either valet parking by the hotel which is 24 euro per night or the Q park which is directly behind the hotel and is to be paid direct to Q park.
The cleanliness of the room was second to none! Impeccable!
Would definitely stay again and will look through tripadvisor as they sometimes have free upgrade offers available.",5,2016,07,14
206,Smart cosmopolitan hotel,"Great hotel in the new part of the city. Lovely rooms with some really great views of the liffey. Roof top bar lovely on a sunny evening! Staff are 100% parking has to be booked before you arrive though, which is a bit of a pain but it's probably limited so that's all they can do. ",4,2016,07,13
206,Weekend away,"Great hotel, lovely rooms and a nice, relaxing bar. Don't be afraid if you think it's a bit out of the way as its only a short taxi ride from the centre and on a nice day only a nice walk along the river from town. 
One of the best contemporary hotels I've stayed in. Enjoy. ",5,2016,07,13
206,One of the Best you can stay at in Dublin,"The Marker Hotel is exceptional, from check in to the Rooftop experience (book well in advance as it is a hot property) to the rooms (we had a suite and it was spectacular) to the whole ambience.  It is engaging but not fussy and in the hottest part of Dublin right now.  ",5,2016,07,13
206,Perfect location; great hotel,"If you're into an updated, more contemporary hotel, this is your hotel.  Location is perfect; staff are friendly, facilities are very updated and work well!  My only issue was that housekeeping was not that great.  ",4,2016,07,13
206,Spectacular,"Stayed here for 1 night with my boyfriend and we were blown away. Everything was fabulous, especially the service we received at check in. Would definitely return in a heartbeat. Gorgeous modern rooms too! ",5,2016,07,13
206,"Beautiful, modern five star hotel","The hotel is very stylish and modern. Interior a bit cool. Situated at the docks, about 15minutes to the city by foot. Personnel is extremely friendly, forthcoming and helpful. The rooftop bar is nice for a drink after dinner. ",5,2016,07,12
206,Wonderful night at the Marker Brasserie and Rooftop Bar,"This hotel is really gorgeous. The staff are all so attentive and just lovely.

 We had dinner in the Brasserie and it was delicious. Gary was our waiter and honestly he made our evening so great  - he totally knows his stuff and is absolutely lovely. A superstar! We had a great laugh with him.

We had the tastiest cocktails on the Rooftop terrace after dinner - amazing views and the staff up there were so friendly and warm too.

Big thanks to everyone for making our night so lovely.

Totally recommend  :)",5,2016,07,12
206,Best in Dockside!,"I just love this Dublin hotel and don't want to stay anywhere else.  It's perfection in all categories.  The room is simply beautiful, the bathroom over-the-top gorgeous, and everything about my stay was perfect.",5,2016,07,11
206,"Beautiful hotel, amazing rooms, poor air conditioning.","Hotel was perfect in every way, except the rooms are hot and stuffy with no way to open the windows.  Disappointing considering the price and a 5 star hotel rating. The staff was most helpful but their Judd were tied as the problem seems to be inherit in the design of the hotel. ",2,2016,07,11
206,Short Visit to Dublin,We stayed at The Marker during a short holiday trip to Dublin. It was excellent in everyway. The room was beautifully appointed and so very comfortable. The staff were outstanding. We all wished we could have stayed longer. I will definitely book The Marker the next time I am in Dublin.  ,5,2016,07,10
206,"Beautiful, comfortable hotel","I stayed here for business in July, 2016-- it is a beautiful hotel with wonderful service and accommodations.  Rooms are huge and beautiful-- bathrooms are all marble with huge deep tubs and separate showers.   The bed was comfortable and staff quickly  brought me down pillows on my request.  Additionally, the desk had an outlet for US plugs-- winning!

I had breakfast there each day and it was the best I have ever experiences.  There is a hot bar for those who like those things, but I really enjoyed the cold breakfast: lots of lovely breads, fruits and cheeses, honey on the comb, beautiful yoghurt.

Loved my experience at the Marker!",5,2016,07,10
206,Very trendy hotel,"We stayed at The Marker for 4 nights and had a fantastic time while there. All of the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We came for our honeymoon (and let them know ahead of time), and they put extra effort into making it a great experience for us.

The hotel (and rooms) is quite modern, so everything still has a new, hip feel to it. There was plenty of space in our room, and we really felt pampered. One minor note is that there wasn‚Äôt a lot of counter space in the bathroom.

We got breakfast for one morning, which is cheaper if you book it ahead of time instead of just going down. There is a large continental breakfast with a variety of fancy breads, grains, and fruit, as well as the hot buffet with all of the components of a full Irish breakfast.

I would definitely recommend going to the pool if you have a chance: it is at least as impressive as the pictures.

They have a ""4 for 3"" deal where you can stay for 4 nights for the price of 3, and given the prices for this hotel, you might consider it",5,2016,07,10
206,Top Quality Service and hotel,The marker hotel is ideally located near the theatre with exceptional customer service and amazing staff. I stayed there with my partner for his birthday and would highly recommend the hotel. We will definitely book and stay again soon. ,5,2016,07,08
206,Chic hotel ,"I stayed at the Marker Hotel for one night with my husband in Dublin. 
It is a very nice chic hotel. 
Good customer service.
Clean.
We received a very appreciated early check in after travel overnight from Boston! 
Cute bar downstairs, nice front patio. 
It is a bit far from shopping restaurants etc. 
It has wonderful views from front facing rooms of river and grounds. 
My huge disappointment was that the roof top bar ( which was one of my main reasons for selecting this hotel over others) was CLOSED for a private event. 
As nice as it was, the rooftop bar being closed was a real buzzkill.
It should never be closed to guest as it's advertised as an amenity. 
",4,2016,07,07
206,Business Review,"Whilst this was a business trip, I have also stayed in the Marker for leisure breaks. I have found the location to be outstanding , the quality of the rooms to be outstanding and the staff to be very friendly. Whilst this is a 5 star it is in no way pretentious ! ",5,2016,07,07
206,Really good property,"Again, a really good property in an up and coming area of Dublin. If you want to be in the middle of the Dublin tourist area, you can find more convenient spots. However, this is close enough if you don't mind walking or a short taxi ride.",4,2016,07,07
206,Amazing hotel and staff.,"We stayed one night and loved every minute of it. We have stayed in other 5 star hotels, but what we loved about the Marker Hotel was the standard all round was excellent and the staff were so friendly. üòÄüëè",5,2016,07,06
206,High-class luxury for a good price,"We were fortunate to stay in this hotel for apprx. 3 weeks as we hunted for a place to live in Dublin. The Marker recently went through a transformation/reno and boy does it show it's class. The hotel is very French chic, the rooms are extremely comfortable, and the food  both downstairs (bar and brassiere) and the room service is very good. Everything about this hotel is high class right down to the little chocolates they leave on your pillow after turn down service.",5,2016,07,06
206,Dublin Family Holiday,"The Marker is in a quiet location away from the noise of the city.  The rooms were spacious and immaculate.  The staff was friendly at all locations, reception, doormen and bar. I agree with another review that breakfast should be included in the price of the room. That would have made the cost/value more in line for an all over excellent review. 4.8/5.0",5,2016,07,06
206,"""Luxurious & Classy""",Had a really enjoyable stay at The Marker Hotel. The rooftop bar is trendy & cool. The hotel itself is ultra modern and trendy. Staff were extremely courteous and could not be more helpful. I look forward to staying again in The Marker Hotel in the not to distant future. ,5,2016,07,05
206,Fantastic Hotel - Exceptional!!,"We arrived July 1, 2016 and checked out July 3, 2016.  I never heard of this hotel but took a chance based on TripAdvisor reviews.  This is definitely a luxury hotel.  The rooms were very nice and spacious and the bathroom with the heating floors was amazing.  The complimentary water and fruits in the lobby is just great.  The hotel is about a 20 minute walk to City Center.  I would definitely stay here again.  ",5,2016,07,05
206,Nice stay,It was a nice hotel on the docks. Black coridoors gave it a funny feel. The rooms were nice and comfortable but nothing  that made it stand out. I thought for the price it should have included breakfast.,4,2016,07,05
206,Special occasion made truly delightful,"An amazing stay at the marker to celebrate a special occasion. The staff truly went to the highest level to make our stay that extra special. Hotel, food, rooftop bar, hotel bar, staff and leisure centre all top class. Top class. Rooms really quite which was great.",5,2016,07,05
206,Easiest the number 1 hotel in dublin,"From arriving to checking out your treated like your special 
The concierge (Robert) is an outstanding gentleman as are the housekeeping 
The staff on a whole is very complimentary and very attentive to your every need",5,2016,07,05
206,My favorite hotel in Dublin,For any future hotel stays in Dublin - this is my hotel!  Really great in every way. Rooms lovely - restaurant fabulous - spa - very special - ambiance and friendliness - really great.  Very good value - !,5,2016,07,05
206,First Class Hotel in Dublin,"Eight of us stayed at The Marker Hotel, Dublin,  at the end of a week long vacation in Ireland for two nights.  I had a corner suite which was spacious and immaculate - view was not good but the room was excellent.  Our party also reserved two regular rooms and they were also very comfortable.  One pleasant surprise was a 120V outlet at the desk.  Delicious food and a wide variety of mixed drinks at the bar along with excellent customer service was valued by our party.  We walked to Grafton St.,  (a long but enjoyable walk), we visited several pubs around the hotel's central location.  We enjoyed the breakfast buffet one morning and it could not have been better.  Fresh squeezed juices,  meats, cheeses, fruits, granolas and cereals, yogurts, potatoes, eggs, even fresh honey dripping from a honeycomb tray - I have never seen or tasted such fresh honey before!  Customer service was excellent.  ",5,2016,07,05
206,Nothing Special,"The room was lovely but that's were it stops. The food was terrible for an alleged 5 Star Hotel. Don't eat in the Brasserie. The Oysters especially were the worst i've ever had and the chips were virtually dried out and full of salt. The breakfast wasn't much better. The scrambled eggs looked like I cooked them and what Hotel does The service in the Bar area was pretty poor as well as I ended up going up for my own drinks after 10 minutes. When I returned to my table the waitress asked me why I went up and I politely told her how long we'd been waiting. The Roof Top Bars also a joke, we waited ages for a table, then we got upstairs and saw at least 10-15 free tables, seriously get over yourselves. This is not a 5 Star Hotel",3,2016,07,05
206,A Wee Break,"Everything about The Marker Hotel oozes quality from the moment you arrive until the moment you check out as a wheelchair user I found everything very accessible,spacious and comfortable . The food is exceptional (The fresh honey a big surprise) The waiting staff also very informative about the source of the food e.g. Ling Salmon overall a very pleasant welcoming stay ",5,2016,07,04
206,Spectacular,"This place will truly make you feel special. The rooms are huge and the  window view is incredible. Stylish and modern, the hotel has its own atmosphere. Great experience is guaranteed. Remarkable service level and interior will add to that.",5,2016,07,04
206,Girls midweek break,Enjoyable stay a lot of nice touches such as juice on arrival and water in the car Upon leaving. Room was average size and didn't have anything which stood out to make it 5* worthy. Service was very good staff were most attentive. Breakfast was nice but some foods required an additional payment which was surprising as other hotels would include such foods on their buffet! Overall enjoyable ,4,2016,07,04
206,Lives up to its great billing,"This large, modern and immaculate hotel in Dublin's docklands area by the Bord Gais exhibition center is a gem of a business hotel, about 20 minute walk from city center and in a serene, beautiful world of its own. From the time you check in, every experience is of friendly and great service. The rooms (I was in 202) are spacious, very well arranged and decorated and have everything you need for a great stay. Totally recommend it especially if you are into open spaces and walking and views of water.

Small issues worth addressing
--have some artificial sweetners in addition to sugar in your room coffee cupboard
--keep an eye on those towels...some have been washed way too much and are getting stiff.
--would be nice to vary the hot food at breakfast buffett especially if one is staying for more than 2-3 days at at time.",5,2016,07,04
206,Well done The Marker,"We stayed in the Marker hotel for a number of reasons. We were going to a concert in the 3 area so it was very well located. It was also good value, not cheap, but good value in comparison to many hotels in Dublin whose costs seem to rise exponetially when events are on in the City. The Marker had also been recommended by a friend so this was a good chance to experience it at first hand. We really enjoyed our stay. The staff were very welcoming and efficient throughout our stay. We ate in the Brasserie on our first night and the food and wine were lovely. The hotel is a nice 15-20 minute walk from O'Connell St. We were also delighted that the Airlink bus leaves from literally round the corner, so we had no stress getting to the airport the next day.",4,2016,07,04
206,Too Many Things Went Wrong,"During my 1st ever visit to Dublin, I stayed at the Marker 2 times for a duration of 4 days each. I had to split my stay as they did not have the rooms available at a stretch for the 28 days i was in Dublin. The Westin got most of my business.

During my 1st trip, the AC in the room stopped working and the staff kept telling me that they can read in their system that the temperature in my room is fine. After much insistence, the provided me with a noisy in room cooler to compensate but that stopped working after an hour as well. They moved my to a different room late at night as their maintenance staff had left for the day. Although they offered to move my luggage for me, I still had to pack everything.

The room they moved me to had a blocked sink. I just gave up on the idea of complaining to them over and over again.

On my 2nd trip, I got a room that was worse off. I had the view of a black wall in front of me and the shower head was choked and not working well. Upon insisting, they again had me move to a different room, with a working shower but same view. In the 2nd room, the power outlets were not working and I had to use an extension cord and lug it around the room back and forth to have access to a power outlet by the bed and working desk.

Finally, their staff, although very friendly and helpful was not able to cater to the issues that took place. Also, there were issues with regards to when I was trying to make a payment with an off-site credit card and I had to have my company liaison drive in from outside of Dublin to make the payment on my behalf. 

I heard great things about the Marker, I am sure it is a good hotel but my experience wasn't perfect. The staff was friendly, they tried to help where they could but could not make up for all the inconvenience. 

The rooftop bar is nice, the rooms are clean, the room service is great but there were too many things wrong with multiple rooms. Also, they do not have any kind of loyalty program, so that is a negative in itself for repeat customers. ",2,2016,07,04
206,Excellent Hotel,"The staff very very friendly, courteous and very helpful. There was no fuss, which made our trip all the more enjoyable and relaxing. With out doubt, one of the best hotels in Dublin and would definitely stay there again. Very well located and convenient for theatres, shopping and restaurants. Highly recommended.",5,2016,07,04
206,A real treat,"My partner and I stayed here, as we were attending a party in the hotel. The room was beautiful with a huge bathroom. The food in the hotel was fabulous and so well presented. A real treat to stay here.",5,2016,07,04
206,What a great hotel with amazing staff,"The hotel was amazing and they really went out there way to look after us.

The male who checked us in name was Stephan I think, he gave me a very nice room overlooking the square the room was amazing with a great view! All the team there were very nice, friendly and used our names well. The Hotel was very clean and modern. The room was very nice, clean, with everything you need and an amazing bathroom with big bath and shower and the bed was so comfortable. I had room service during the night, the waiter Abdul I think was very nice and had great knowledge on food and was helpful. The food was great. The breakfast in the morning was amazing too such a good selection off food and an amazing team.
",5,2016,07,04
206,Recent Stay,Fantastic and enjoyable stay in the Hotel and the customer service was excellent. A very good relaxed experience overall. Would definitely recommend the Marker and hopefully will be back in the future. ,5,2016,07,04
206,Concert break,"Excellent service and facilities would be back very soon üòâüòâ staff very conscientious and dignified and treated us with total respect room was excellent and the food was exquisite we have used this hotel before and knew we would get the best of service 
Give yourselves a pat on the back and keep the good work up üòâüòâ",5,2016,07,04
206,Good for business,"Terrific location, employees and venue. Would be hard to beat.  Had not stayed here before but would definitely do so again.  Walked everywhere that I wanted to go.  Check in staff and concierge were over the top great.",5,2016,07,04
206,Best hotel ever,"The marker hotel truly is something special , the staff are so professional and friendly, the rooms are very modern yet comfortable, the restaurant is amazing n the bar has cocktails to die for cannot recommend this hotel more , really nice romantic break for couples ",5,2016,07,04
206,Surprise weekend,"Firstly I want to start by saying thank you to all the staff for making this stay a perfect one.
Treated like vip's all weekend. This was a very special trip booked as a surprise gift from my husband, so the experience played a massive part in what he had in mind when he booked this hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel to any couple who are wanting a true 5* experience.

We stayed in room 318, which wasn't even a top spec room but was absolutely brilliant. Amazing view, huge bed, all of the essentials. Located at the very end of the hallway, so no one was walking past constantly. I've got to mention the carpet in this hotel is like heaven on bare feet :-)

I would suggest to eat breakfast here at least once. Lots of fresh fruit, many healthy options & also a full Irish cooked breakfast, had the yummiest cup of tea with it too. Toast cooked for you, so no standing waiting for it yourself which is ideal. Also the rooftop bar is a must, fab music played! (Maybe for the slightly more modern couple) but cocktails in the sunshine was lovely.
The concierge guy, Leon. Particularly made us feel very welcome. And a huge thank you to whoever over heard us talking about our anniversary (not previously mentioned to any staff members prior to arrival) because when we arrived up to our room after a day of seeing the sights, we opened the door to couple of cute little puddings with a message on the plate!
Fab touch!",5,2016,07,03
206,The Marker in Dublin is Awesome,We stayed here the first night of our one week vacation in Ireland.  Peter and Zagia made the trip for us very special. There were super accommodating and helped us plan the rest of our trip.  This is a first class hotel with first class people operating it.,5,2016,07,03
206,Business trip,Hotel is an excellent location for the Convention Centre and theatre  but is a walk to the city centre. But enjoyed the stay nevertheless. I agree with others that although the breakfast is good I feel that the availability of hot food is somewhat limited.,5,2016,07,03
206,Really disappointed!,"I lived in Dublin for 4 years and have stayed in fabulous hotels all around Ireland.  In DublinI have stayed at the Shelbourne, The four Season and the Merrion.  I  have since moved from Dublin and was visiting old friends this summer.  I mostly stayed at friend's house's but thought it would be nice to have a night of luxury with a friend who was visiting from London.  I was really disappointed with the hotel.  The service in the bar was really poor, and the restaurant is closed during the day and the bar menu very limited.  In addition, we couldn't get access to the roof top bar and I felt frustrated that I had to pay and additional 50 Euros for a rollway bed for my daughter as I was already paying 440 Euros for the nigh for a deluxe roomt!  Therefore, my rate was almost 500 Euros for the night.  However, I booked here for one reason only: to have access to the spa.  When we called in the morning they  had no appointments but said we could come down and use the spa and pool for free (as is the norm in a hotel).  We then had a leisurely breakfast and head to spa at 12:30 where we were then  told we could only have access to the spa until 2 because we were checking out that day.   I was really disappointed by this as we had not been told that when we called and also I feel it falls short of the industry norm.    I have never been asked to leave a spa early as a paying guest of any other luxury hotel.  
On the  positive side, I think the location is great, the front desk people were very well trained and helpful ( although,I was promised a call from he manager but didn't receive one-which was fine) and the bar manager also was terrific when he realized that we had been receiving poor service and then was very attentive and concerned.  In fact, upon reflection I would say the staff was really very good!  So my poor rating may be a bit unfair but I was just frustrated with Spa policy and felt for the price the luxury and charm just wasn't there.",2,2016,07,03
206,Marker Midweek,Great Hotel.  Excellent for business traveler.  Good location and rooftop bar is a real treat.   Restaurant lacks atmosphere but everything else was fab.  Rooms are very well finished.   Would thoroughly recommend it ,5,2016,07,03
206,Our Experience of the Marker Hotel,This is an expensive hotel that lacks character. The roof-top bar was not open during our 3 day visit which was a disappointment. All the staff were well trained to look after their guests and did so well. unfortunately there was nothing about the hotel that focussed on Dublin.,3,2016,07,03
206,Short stay for buisness,"Nice hotel and location..Came in recommend and lived up to its reputation 

Service was up to mark.  Rooms were very nice especially coming from London and we're spacious.  Location ensured that I had no problem getting into work as also taking a cab back to the airport! ",4,2016,07,03
206,Good quality conference hotel,"This is a great independent hotel in Dublin - not bustling with character in my view, and could probably pass for a good Hilton or Marriott - but quality rooms, dining, lobby bar and conference facilities, i could easily come here again.

Good quality free wifi throughout hotel.

Food was a little uncreative over the 4 day conference I was at, same buffet breakfast everyday and just a simple selection of sandwiches and a soup choice at lunch.

Staff were good - friendly and attentive, though service at the lobby bar (bar and table service) could be a bit faster, was often looking and calling out for service.

About 15 to 20 minutes walk into centre of town, but good for the docks and businesses around there.

Ferryman pub worth a visit if you want something local with a bit of character.",4,2016,07,02
206,Great stay,"Great stay, good location, lovely room. Breakfast was varied and good quality. Customer service was friendly and professional. Atmosphere was relaxed and happy. Good experience. Well done Marker! Thank you.",5,2016,07,02
206,Ok,"Good but would not return.
I went there with two friends. We had a corner suite which was beautiful. The Lightning was poor which made putting on make up almost impossible. 
Buffet Breakfast was very disappointing after having recently experienced the fantastic Europe hire Killarney breakfast!!!
Overall I would not return. ",4,2016,07,01
206,Business stay for concerns at Convention Centre,"Very good stay. Lovely room, nice spa and pool, food staff, location excellence for Convention Centre but less good from city centre. Buffet breakfast good but cooked breakfast needs work. Bar good - rooftop limited access weekdays as often used for private functions.",4,2016,07,01
206,Execellent luxury hotel in Dublin,"Everything was perfect!
Clean, modern, luxury, good food, big bed and comfortable, good location, staff responsive and very friendly.
They have inside pool and jacuzzi, massage, free tea and fruits.
I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2016,07,01
206,What a 5-star hotel should be,"If you like fancy, modern, high-end hotels with great service, there's probably nothing like this in Dublin. I got a corner suite which was amazing. The folks at reception were very helpful with every little request, the bar is lively, the area by the docks is fun. A nice 10-15 min walk to Trinity College.",5,2016,06,30
206,Modern standard hotel,"Interesting design, nice rooms, great service. Pillows uncomfortable, airconditioning did not work. Food was ok. Aerea is modern but quite far to the city centre. Unfortunatly we did not sleep well because of the non working airconditioning.",3,2016,06,30
206,Great stay,"I stayed at Marker in June 2016, while travelling to Dublin for business,  I can only recomand the hotel.
Room, personal, facilities are all excellent, and location of the property is ideal for business travel.",5,2016,06,30
206,A week in Dublin,"I felt like I was in Heaven. Superb facilities, lovely staff. The gym is excellent. Would have liked to go to the pool but no time, but apparently it is divine. Easy 10 minute walk to the centre of town or 5 euro taxi ride",5,2016,06,29
206,First Class,"Top Class stay in fabulous hotel. Staff are excellent.
Nice location. Great Service. Faultless. Food and drink a bit expensive but suppose this is the going rate these days in Dublin. Great selection at breakfast. Nice touch with the fresh honey!",5,2016,06,28
206,Perfection,"The Marker hotel & its staff are exceptional.  We had one of the nicest meals ever at our most recent stay on 25Jun16.  The staff made us feel as if we were the only guests at the hotel.  You get a real 5 Star experience.  Luxurious, modern hotel.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else when visiting Dublin.  ",5,2016,06,28
206,Nice hotel with a few problems,"After paying for what is quite an expensive room we tried on 2 separate occasions to go to the rooftop bar. Both times we where asked to wait and on the second told we would be brought up in 2 min. More than 45 later we where still waiting after watching many others go up and when I questioned this was told I was lying and was not told to wait
Very poor",4,2016,06,28
206,A real treat,"This is a fabulous hotel in every aspect. My husband and I stayed for 2 nights and it was a real treat. The service alone is 5*. The staff are very well qualified in their field, from check in to bar staff and security. Hotel is absolutely spotless with beautiful airy rooms that had a fantastic view across the canal. We ordered food from bar on Friday night as we arrived late. The receptionist called the bar for us to reserve a table and hold last order so we could leave our bags in the room and freshen up. Breakfast was exquisite with more choice than anyone could think off. Will certainly be back. ",5,2016,06,28
206,"Beautiful, Clean, and Modern :-)","I absolutely loved this hotel! It was clean, modern and had a friendly staff. The bathroom tub was fabulous. We had a chance to visit the rooftop bar which gave us great views. I would definitely recommend this hotel. This hotel is in a great location and within walking distance to many places to eat. ",5,2016,06,27
206,It was all good!,"My husband and I stayed here in May because of a conference he was attending nearby. Generally, conference hotels are fine, but not perfect. The Marker, on the other hand, left us with virtually nothing but good things to say. It was the quietest urban hotel I've ever stayed in (due to its location on a plaza away from traffic), so we slept well. The room was very comfortable, including the bed. As others have said, the staff is very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast is plentiful. The hotel is slightly farther from the center than some others, but still within walking distance of many sights, including the new Irish diaspora museum. We would definitely stay at The Marker if we were ever in Dublin again.",5,2016,06,27
206,Wonderful stay in Dublin!,"What a beautiful and modern hotel - the rooms were just lovely, extremely modern, really nice shower - and the beds super comfortable.  The room was silent, even though the weather was beautiful and there were lots of people outdoors.",5,2016,06,27
206,riverdance,nice hotel. staff were friendly. great location. only problem was we were unable to open any windows in our room for fresh air. ordered chocalates for arrival but didn't receive them but weren't charged for them,4,2016,06,27
206,Mid Week busines trip,"This is a really nice hotel, friendly staff, great public areas, very comfortable rooms.
Valet parking available
Central location, only a 15 minute walk to Grafton Street.
Perfect for the business traveller.                                                                            ",5,2016,06,27
206,Truly 5 stars,"The Marker Hotel is a true luxury hotel, no doubt about it. From the sumptuously decorated rooms to the fantastic breakfast buffet service, it's all top notch. The hotel itself is a little way out of the centre of town - about a 20 minute walk - but very close to the Convention Centre. The staff are very friendly, and, being only a few years old, the hotel is still in very good shape. There is apparently a roof top bar, but it's only 'open' at the weekend, I think, which was a shame.",5,2016,06,26
206,Dublin first time,Great hotel and good location.  Pleasant stay and super friendly staff.  I woul stay there again.  It's a 20 min walk to city center but cabs are in front of the hotel if you don't want to walk.  Restaurants and cafes are nearby.,5,2016,06,26
206,Excellent hotel,"This is an excellent hotel.  The rooms are beautiful, well decorated and spotlessly clean.  Beds are extremely comfortable.  Breakfast was well worth the money and they even make your toast which is a rare luxury in hotels these days!  The pool is amazing and we were able to use it after checkout until 2pm. The staff were an absolute pleasure; professional, efficient and very friendly.  The location is great and I will definitely be returning. ",5,2016,06,26
206,Business Trip,Excellent hotel.  Comfortable accommodation. Polite and efficient service. Upset I lost my shoes. Probably put in cupboard by staff. Roof bar closed for private party. Expensive hotel but good value compared to other hotels as the service was excellent.,5,2016,06,26
206,Marker Hotel,"Overall a great hotel in an ok, but not great location. Would highly recommend the hotel due to friendly helpful staff, nice rooms, good quality sleep. 
Breakfast buffet was ok, but the inclusive a la carte made up for it.

206,"The Marker Hotel Dublin, Ireland","Excellent hotel which I would strongly recommend.  The staff are extremely helpful, polite and profession.  The room was comfortable with everything you would want.  On my next trip to Dublin I will be definately booking to stay at the Marker Hotel.",5,2016,06,26
206,Good modern hotel,"Good modern hotel , a little distance from the centre of Dublin,but Goodbar , soft beds , and happy friendly service ,
Food in bar was good and overall experience was good for a reasonable price , just a little distance from centre but nice area with canals ",4,2016,06,25
206,Nightcap in luxurious surroundings! ,We called after visiting the nearby Bord Gais Theatre. We were shown to seats overlooking the canal. We ordered our drinks which were served by a lovely young waitress. A visit to the rooftop bar would have been interesting but there was a queue and we were happy enough sitting in the comfortable and busy foyer. Wifi is available (free). The drinks were quite expensive but worth the visit! Next time we may stay there...it does look very inviting! ,4,2016,06,25
206,Excellent customer service,"We came for a conference at the Convention Center. The hotel was in a great location, a five minute walk to the conference center and 20 minute walk into town. The customer service was unparalleled. Rooms are very clean, new and comfortable. 
",5,2016,06,25
206,Stylish & modern,"Stayed for a night while on holiday. Very nice property: luxurious with great customer service at reception, full concierge, well-appointed spacious room, terry cloth robe and slippers, and speedy free wifi. Hotel is situated right off the 702 Aircoach express line from Dublin airport so getting to and from the airport is quite convenient for 14 Euro return as of 06/2016. It is a bit of a hike from the Temple Bar and historic areas of Dublin, however, so beware. Location is on the east side of the city near the quay. One particularly nice feature of the guestrooms is the availability of US style outlets. Everything was spotlessly clean. Overall a very relaxing and satisfactory experience.",5,2016,06,25
206,They hit the Mark,"The Marker was a extremely lovely hotel that was only surpassed by the kindness of the staff. Everyone was so warm & lively, which made me visit such a grand experience. Highly recommend, golden seal.",5,2016,06,23
206,One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in! ,"Just got back from a lovely long weekend in Dublin. Could not find a fault with The Marker. The staff were lovely and friendly, food was amazing and the rooms were divine.

We will definitely be returning to this hotel. Thank you so much for the lovely time spent in your hotel.",5,2016,06,22
206,Wow!,We had the most amazing time at The Marker.  Jonathon was very welcoming and informative during the check in process.  Room service experience was presented beautifully and the food was of course delicious.  The rooftop bar is the most splendid place for hand crafted cocktails in Dublin.,5,2016,06,22
206,Comfortable stay,I enjoyed my stay. I was traveling alone for the first time in Ireland. The rooms were comfortable and very clean. The bathroom and toiletries provided were great. The staff were very helpful and friendly. I would stay here again. ,4,2016,06,22
206,great but avoid room 534,"fab team and service, great food and beverages, good health and spa facilities.  note the pool area is very slippery due to stone floor and water - but is a nice space nevertheless.  gym is good but the free weights need updating for the olympic bar",5,2016,06,22
206,Marker Hotel - A perfect place to stay,"This is an excellent 5 star hotel. We had the pleasure of staying for a weekend break and found all of the staff to be very welcoming and professional at all times, from the concierge to bar staff and reception staff. The rooms are very clean and well appointed and the hotel is just across the street from the Bord Gais theatre. The range of drinks in the bar is excellent and the bar food is of a very high standard.",5,2016,06,21
206,This is where to stay in Dublin,"We stayed at The Marker for 5 nights. This is a very new hotel in the Docklands. It's pefectly positioned for the CCD and the business district along the river., close enough to the Temple.Bar district. Everything was just perfect, the staff, the room, the bar and the restaurant..5 stars. A highly recommendable place. Spoil yourself, stay at The Marker.",5,2016,06,21
206,CCA Visit,Very comfortable hotel. Ideally situated and great staff. I attended a CCA business event. All facilities were spot on. Food beverages were great. Full Irish breakfast was exceptional. I would definitely recommend this facility and stay again if I had the opportunity,5,2016,06,21

Staff very helpful and friendly couldn't have done any more
Would love to stay again better start saving üòÄüòÄ",5,2016,06,21
206,Disappointed in one aspect!,"Always stay at The Westbury but The Marker was recommended by a friend as she said I'd love the rooftop bar! So, i booked it! Unable to get access on either nights of my stay! Hugely disappointed as its s selling point and I was a resident! Apparently, parties were booked in! ",4,2016,06,21
206,The Marker. Hit the mark,"Amazing. Our room (620)was out of this world. Honestly the best I've ever stayed in at a hotel. Perfect location and only ‚Ç¨8 from train station. The pool and spa was great only problem was time. The lack of it. Thanks again guys. Can't wait to go back 
",5,2016,06,21
206,Excellent Hotel!,"Great service, fantastic rooms, awesome front desk, great service in hotel bar/food area and outstanding room service! Only possible complaint is food could be a little spicer, more flavor. But I felt that way with most places in Dublin. Cultural difference I guess. I'd still give this hotel a 5 star rating! ",5,2016,06,20
206,Excellent modern Dublin hotel,"I stayed at The Marker for 5 nights for a conference, June 2016. Could not fault it, highly recommended. Buffet breakfast service particularly good. Good location for conference centre and easily walkable to city centre.",5,2016,06,20

206,Good property but location is average,"I stayed in The Marker hotel for 1 night in May 2016. The hotel is good. The rooms have dark interiors which I personally don't like. I like Bright colors. The corridor was very dark which I don't recommend. The breakfast was good. It is located right opposite a Bord Gais Energy theatre which hosts some phenomenal shows. So anyone who has booked a show there, this hotel is perfect. There are not much eating joints nearby as it is located near the Grand Canal. Rest this hotel is fine for 1 night.",4,2016,06,20
206,Enjoyable,"Room was very clean,bathroom quite big. Bed very very very comfortable and employees very helpful and very friendly. 
Location of hotel very handy. Definitely will come again. I highly recommend to anybody who wants enjoy their stay as celebrity :)",4,2016,06,20
206,Marker - v good hotel Dublin,"Quietly efficient hotel conveniently located for Dublin convention centre. Very modern and clean. Excellent breakfast (I had meals organised for me for lunch and dinner). Only minor gripe is that gym ccould be a little bigger, equipment good but at times space for floor exercising limited. Nice pool",4,2016,06,19
206,Great service but rooms smell,"I stayed for only a day, was able to cope with the smelly room. My room smelled old and moist despite the decor being new and contemporary. I asked my coworker if her room also had the smell ...when I heard it did , I  did not bother asking for a different room, plus I was there for a short time and I had no time to deal with this as I had to work.

206,Good hotel and location,"Very nice hotel and location for business or pleasure. Excellent food . The gym and spa staff and facilities are very appointed and in very good working order.

206,Wonderful wonderful wonderful,"From the location within walking or short taxi distance from Dublin city centre to the immediate surroundings this place has it all.  I have to confess I'm a Dublin native I live just over the river, but I was getting my place renovated so had to move out for a couple of days.  

The staff in the Marker could not have been friendlier, it's not a head up its own back side  5 star hotel, the staff from the cleaners to the hotel manager are totally down to earth.  

The room I had was lovely, not too romantic more businessy I thought but I was there on my own so what do I know?  

I really can't fault it except maybe change the choices on the bar menu now and again, there's only so many club sandwiches one can eat.  Btw the burgers and outside seating is amazing.",5,2016,06,17
206,Marker hotel it is as if we were at home,"SIMPLY perfect . 
Quiet, enjoying a magnificent weekend. 
He really be too require to find a fault with this hotel.

",4,2016,06,16
206,fantastic hotel,"Honestly, it's really nice; quiet comfortable; good kitchen; nice staff; great amenities, close to everything.  Gym really nice (better than most).  Has a decent pool 20 m.  If you're a runner there are lots of potential routes outside the front door.  If you're in town on biz this is the place.  Good for romance too.",5,2016,06,15
206,Classy Choice,"The Marker Hotel will not disappoint.  The hotel is well located, although not dead centre in the city the location has a great vibe to it surrounded by great views and a buzz of people, only a short walk away from the main centre.  The hotel itself has a iconic design on the outside and superbly decorated throughout. The hotel bar is a large area in the immediate entrance furnished with an array of comfortable and cosy seating options.  The staff from the time you arrive at the front door are friendly, helpful and welcoming. Views from our room were lovely and the room (standard) spacious and well decorated.",5,2016,06,15
206,Roof top bar Closed ,"My boyfriend treated me to the Marker for Valentines Day, gorgeous hotel, beautiful food and great atmosphere.

206,Superb hotel on south bank of the river.,"Last hotel on a 2 week escorted tour.  Absolutely tops. Wonderfully appointed, and a great restaurant and bar.  Full range of amenities and services.  Only a short cab ride to the Temple Bar area of central Dublin.",5,2016,06,15
206,Incredible,"Incredible hotel highly recomendable for business or pleasure, incredible staff, morning breakfast outstanding, close to the city tourists spots, the gym and the pool are great and the spa is amazing.",5,2016,06,14
206,Great Experience!,"From the moment we arrived and were greeted by a doorman, the entire staff was friendly & helpful.  The check-in was quick & easy, the room was clean & comfortable, the breakfast was delicious & varied, the bar was lively & fun.  Everything was perfect and we'll definitely return on our next trip to Dublin!",5,2016,06,14
206,Great weekend break in Dublin,"The hotel is very conveniently located with great facilities. You are straight into the Dublin buzz when you walk out. The theatre is just across the hotel and Dublin city centre is walking distance.
The pool is excellent.",5,2016,06,14
206,Michael Carbery,"Wonderful experience staff excellent and perceptive to our needs. 
Breakfast lovely space and great selection with 1 exception no fresh scones. Pool lovely length and temperature. Great firm bed so slept very restfully",5,2016,06,14
206,Friendly staff. Quiet hotel.,"Very friendly staff, special mention to doorman Leon. Very quiet hotel and good facilities. Spotlessly clean. Lovely spa treatments and good pool. Room well sized. Only minor negatives were lack of room storage and low shower pressure. Also be prepared for a long walk to city centre or 8 euro taxi, that said the very quiet rooms make it worthwhile.",4,2016,06,14
206,"Stains on bed linen. Phone in room broken !""",Yes my husband and I stayed at this vile hotel for only one night. We found yellowish stains on our bed sheets. When we tried to call reception we realised that the phone was broken and would not work. It took 2 hrs for a guy to come and fix our line and the receptionist was quite dry and rude with me. Has put me off going back sat all now.,2,2016,06,13
206,Excellent experience!,"Great corporate event- Good room- lots of light and the right temperature, lovely food that appeared as if by magic without disrupting the conference, really lovely staff- nothing too much trouble for them! I would highly recommend for a corporate event.

As the organiser of the event I was upgraded to the most amazing suite- just cannot fault!!

Can't wait to come back!",5,2016,06,13
206,Flawless,"My stay was simply flawless. The staff was very welcoming, my room was very spacious and had an excellent bed. Breakfast was proper as well. I especially liked the lobby, which roof looks amazing. All in all I would definitely recommend it.",5,2016,06,12
206,Excellence all around,"From check in through check out, The Marker was an exceptional experience. The staff were kind and helpful at every turn. The room was spacious and comfortable and room service was quite good. I'd recommend The Marker to anyone staying in the Dublin area!",5,2016,06,11
206,Docklands,"Great location, classy hotel and right in the heart of the Docklands silicon valley. Hospitality great, food plentiful and very good, but a pity the bedroom window is a sealled unit so you cannot get fresh air, only aircon.",4,2016,06,11
206,Great Hotel,"We had a great weekend in the Market, the hotel is fabulous. Rooms aren't any bigger than your normal hotel room but they are definitely not modern and luxurious. We checked in and the receptionist took our visa debit as a guarantee. Our stay was lovely, staff very polite and helpful. A visited the rooftop bar which I think is a little over rated to be honest. There was a two hour wait to visit the rooftop during the day. On check out we were advised after we had paid that the receptionist on checkout should not have taken guarantee payment from a visa debit card as it isn't as easy to return. So now we have to wait ten days untill out bank return 525e. I'm sure i'm not the first/last customer this will happen to, I think for such an expensive and upmarket hotel this could and should have been avoided. After a great weekend and stay at the hotel it leaves me a little annoyed.

206,Birthday trip with sister,"This review is a bit late coming, myself and my sister stayed on a Saturday night at the end of July last year as a birthday gift from mum for my 30th birthday. Now, have to say, i didn't get the full experience as I was at the beginning of meningitis and was feeling terrible (didn't know this until I checked out of this beautiful hotel and into hospital). The room was beautiful and there was a letter there to welcome us and to wish me a happy birthday. We weren't in the room long and someone popped in with cake and wine and a decorated plate for my birthday. Really lovely touch. We then had spa treatments which were lovely (and would have been much more enjoyable if I was in full health). We had an evening meal which I wasn't really able to eat but it looked beautiful and my sister enjoyed it. The room was beautifully decorated and the bed was so comfy. Next morning, we went for breakfast, I had become very unwell at this stage so wasn't able to eat but everything looked fresh and tasty and there was an excellent choice. We checked out earlyish (10am) and the valet parking was very efficient, we didn't have to wait for the car which was a relief! After a  long stay in hospital I was back to myself and disappointed that such a lovely hotel had been wasted, bad timing I guess. Hopefully someone treats me for my 40th and we can return :) I would definitely recommend this hotel, it's worth every star! ",5,2016,06,09
206,A delight!,"A real treat to stay here.....would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone.  A true 5 star experience.  Already looking for an excuse to return! I would also recommend
Le drunch on a Sunday. Delicious food and yummy cocktails.
",5,2016,06,09
206,Amazing weekend at The Marker,"From arrival to departure, our stay at The Marker was exceptional. This is a 5 star that understands the personal touch and delivered many requests that I had made prior to arrival, perfectly. The bedroom was spacious and comfortable. Breakfast selection was large and had some quirky touches, such as a Bloody Mary bar!!! Food was great.  The roof top bar is not to be missed, with great views on the city.  We managed to enjoy the spa before we left and it certainly helped us leave completely refreshed and relaxed. Would we stay again......most definitely!!!! ",5,2016,06,08
206,Would definitely return,"Our stay at The Marker was excellent from beginning to end. As previous reviewers have said, the bed was absolutely fantastic and the service was perfect. It would be a very picky person indeed who managed to pick fault with this hotel. Keep it up!",5,2016,06,08
206,Fine Hotel,"Staff were excellent. Hotel very modern, well kept, spotlessly clean. Rooftop bar beautiful on a hot day. Rooms large and very comfortable. Pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room were perfect. Breakfast was dismal",5,2016,06,08
206,5-Star Experience,"Luxurious, perfectly clean room with a view of Grand Canal Square. Heated floors in the bathroom. Hilariously overpriced room service (25 for full Irish breakfast). Exactly what you would expect of a 5 star hotel. Location in the newer, upscale part of Dublin gives a dramatically different impression of the city than staying elsewhere. 15-20 minute walk to the tourist areas. ",5,2016,06,07
206,"The Marker, one of Dublins best.","Great location, short walk to Trinity College and shopping. Newer hotel so facilities are excellent. A bit pricey but you get what you pay for. Beds and pillows are very comfortable. Room service was also excellent and so was housekeeping. Bathroom was fantastic.",5,2016,06,07
206,Fantastic hotel,"My wife and I decided to visit Dublin for a weekend break, the Marker Hotel,is exceptional in everything, you may pay a little extra but it was well worth it. The spa and pool area are lovely and we enjoyed drinks on the roof terrace, we will defiantly be visiting again.",5,2016,06,07
206,Brilliant stay with my wife,Excellent hotel with excellent service in a brilliant location. We were staying for a Derren Brown show in the bord gais arena l. Literally ten steps away! The room was big with good services. The roof top bar is a must. Great views and excellent cocktails for my wife!,5,2016,06,07
206,Really liked the Marker,"The Marker was clean, new and quiet. The employees were very nice. The rooftop bar was nice but a couple customers weren't very enjoyable, they were rude about smoking right next to our table. Otherwise everything was great! ",5,2016,06,06
206,Super hotel!,"Everything was great, high class and excellent design. Great service at all times! Food was great and location is also really good near the water front area close by a lot of the new business part of Dublin.",5,2016,06,06
206,Great Hotel!,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for one night in Dublin in February.  It is a very modern, beautiful hotel.  The rooms were very spacious.  The beds were very comfortable.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  This hotel is in a more modern section of Dublin, therefore, it is a bit of a walk to the city center.  We took a cab where we needed to go but you could walk if you wanted to.  I wish the rooftop bar was open while we were there.  Although, a worker in the hotel did offer to show it to us!  I would highly recommend this hotel when staying in Dublin.",5,2016,06,05
206,Mid week break,Very nice mid week break. Staff are fantastic. You really feel cared for.  Breakfast is expensive though. The bedroom was really nice especially the bed which was one of the most comfortable we have slept in!,5,2016,06,05
206,Perfect 2 Nights,"Very Nice room and confortable bed,  perfect bathroom with shower and bath. The staff from the restaurant, bar and the Reception were very kind and were always smiling. The breakfast was a perfect start for a hard working day ! ",5,2016,06,05
206,One of the best places i've stayed,"Very clean and elegant design hotel. Friendly staff, great bar, nice spa and sauna facilities. And very clean and spacious rooms. Good breakfast. And it was walking distance from the city center (10mins)
I loved it and i have seen A LOT of hotel rooms but this is certainly one hotel i will come back to.",5,2016,06,05
206,"Great location , poor rooms","The location of the hotel is great , bang in the middle of revitalized dock lands area. 
The room was too small..... Tiny shower ( could hardly move ) and not enough closet space for two 
People and their luggage staying for 2 weeks. Had to leave clothes lying about the room. Get the feeling this hotel is designed for short stays by business types and not tourists . ",3,2016,06,05
206,A very good experience!,"At walking distance from the Conference center, the Marker hotel is the hotel to be in Dublin wether you are attending a conference or just  visiting. Nice rooms (both bed & bathroom), plus very good restaurants add value to the location.",4,2016,06,05
206,Amazing Hotel!,"One of the best hotels we've ever stayed in! Staff were great! Rooms are really nice and very modern. Location is about a 20 min walk to the centre of Dublin, amazing wifi all over the hotel and it's free to use too. Staff couldn't be more helpful! Would definitely recommend this hotel absolutely brilliant!",5,2016,06,05
206,The Boss is back!!!,Stayed 2 nights for the Springsteen weekend. Nice modern hotel. V nice room. Nice new area with a couple of decent restaurants nearby. Good vibe in the sun. Dined in hotel on sat nite which was ok. Would have liked to have gone to rooftop bar but closed on the Sunday & Monday. Seems to be closed a lot. Overall would recommend hotel as very nice but prefer to stay closer to grafton street. Ps Bruce was magic!,4,2016,06,04
206,Very Nice Modern Hotel,"Hotel staff and rooms are very nice and modern.  We enjoyed our three night stay there.  For my husband and I, the only negative was that the hotel location is far removed from Dublin City Centre.  Very long walks, cab or bus rides are necessary in order to be in the heart of Dublin.",4,2016,06,04
206,Amazing weekend,"This is one of my best hotel experiences! The staff met us with impeccable service and the hotel was modern and stylish. We got our room upgraded and it was incredible, with a view toward the harbour. There was included free wifi, minibar, bathroom articles, robes and slippers, safe and option to make coffee/tea. The hotel had a spa on site, but we didn't get time to try it. The location is 10-ish minutes walk from the main city centre, in a lovely, quiet area. What stood out for me was the remarkable, all-round service! I've never met such resortfull personnel, professional and friendly! The evening we arrived, I asked for the possibilities to rent a car the next morning, and even though it was 22:30 the receptionist fixed us a car for the next morning! Breakfast was good and had both continental and order food. We had a amazing weekend at The Marker! Thank you!! We will definitely come back and I recommend this to others!",5,2016,06,03
206,review,"Good staff, decent room with good bathroom.

Staff mentioned the spa but not the rooftop bar and therefore I missed having a drink there.

Breakfast the real disappointment , it was expensive, limited and average in quality",3,2016,06,03
206,Poor service at the Marker,Overcharged by 90 euro on check in. Queried bill and looked for breakdown of bill on checkout where they suddenly discovered mistake. Asked for toast with breakfast arrived as I finished my breakfast.,3,2016,06,03
206,Stay in Dublin,"Its a great hotel, I enjoyed my stay there. Excellent clean room and bathroom. Toiletries were fantastic (the shower gel smells great and lathers well). Towels are nice and fluffy. The view from the Rooftop Bar is lovely at night. Breakfast was great, especially the bacon and sausages. The black and white pudding were lovely too (my first time to eat them). Would definitely recommend it as the place to stay in Dublin.",5,2016,06,02
206,amazing hotel,my boyfriend booked this hotel as a surprise for my birthday and i was not disappointed. The hotel is situated about a 20 minute walk away from the centre however a taxi cost 10 euro. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful our room was not available when we arrived however they took our luggage and assured us that it would be in the room ready for us. the hotel rang us when our room was ready. the room itself was very spacious and extremely clean. as it was my birthday the staff had arranged a little birthday surprise 2 pieces of cake and a happy birthday sign. nothing was to much trouble for the reception staff. would highly recommend this hotel to everyone was very modern and clean.,5,2016,06,02
206,Outstanding!,"Gorgeous rooms, spotlessly clean.  The filter coffee in your room was a lovely touch for an avid coffee drinker.  The pillow menu was very welcome, and when it was delivered, the staff did a turn down service and cleaned my bathroom.  Just lovely. Could not recommend it highly enough!",5,2016,06,02
206,Fabulous Wedding Anniversary Weekend,"Booked for our wedding anniversary weekend which included breakfast package (normally ¬£24.50) Arrived by airbus 702 Dublin airport to Greystones which dropped us within a 5 minute walk around the corner from the hotel. Just before the theatre. 
The hotel is situated within the city district by the river and is the first stop on the 702.
A lovely clean district with restaurants, bars and a couple of supermarkets are within a stones throw of the hotel. On arrival we were greated by a couple of doormen who politely opened the door for us. Reception staff were polite and welcoming. We were offered the option to have our bags taken up but declined and were shown to the lift which is activated by placing your door key/card into the activaction slot. 
On entry into our room, 124 on the first floor, we were pleasantly surprised by the proportions of our room, both sleeping area and bathroom. Very clean, modern and nice view of the public courtyard/seating area outside the hotel. Nice modern TV with on demand music and films. My only issue was a smell of the drain coming from the bathroom? I'm not one to complain but after a day I didnt think it was acceptable (especially for the price paid and the standard of hotel) so informed the front desk who said they would look into it before we returned from our day out.
On return, the smell still hadnt gone so complained again. On our 2nd attempt to rectify the problem the Duty Manager, a lovely young lady who's name, unfortunately, I forget, came to our room and offered to move us. To our great surprise we were not just moved to a better room but to one of the best rooms in the hotel. A luxury corner suite on the 6th floor with your own doorbell, hallway with seating area, 2 lavatories, a large bedroom with walk-in wardrobe, open-plan dining area and lounge with additional TV, nespresso coffee making facilities and some wonderful views of the river. The suite was a home away from home. Not only were we given a wonderful new room but were also treated to some excellent cocktails and a large dinner plate of canap√©s and as we weren't able to watch the movie of our choice we were also given an alternative complimentary movie choice. 
My only issue with this room, which I think visitors need to be made aware of especially of you're paying over ¬£1k a night for a room :-0 , is that the headboard shakes (due to the boiler or air-conditioning ? system ) and youre not able to get to sleep between 12.30-06.00am!!!!???. We did receive a partial refund for this and although extremely grateful for the upgrade and the special touches we received from the staff I'm a bit miffed as to why a hotel of this standard would not have this sorted out??? 
All in all, I give this hotel 5/5 for customer service, dining, standards. Can't fault the staff or facilities but Marker , you really need to sort out that vibrarting headboard!",5,2016,06,01
206,No comment can praise this hotel enough,"Well in case my title fails to convey how I feel, The Marker is fantastic, I could list all that is great, and it would mention the room, the spa, and dining etc, however the main item that makes it special is staff, the employees here are Brilliant, there is nothing that is too much trouble, and they smile, not a false ones but from the heart and from the soul, their eyes are bright, they are interested, trained, professional and outdo ones' expectations.",5,2016,06,01
206,Best hotel I've ever stayed in,"Must stay when you are in Dublin. Beautiful hotel in a stunning area along the docks. Rooms are so big, bright, clean and modern and bathroom is stunning. You are treated like royalty when you stay! Highly recommend this hotel to anyone :) ",5,2016,06,01
206,Service far from 5*,"Check-in not available until after 3pm even after requesting early checkin.  Bar service ridiculously slow-20 mins for bottle of beer. Table given away outdoors after waiting 45mins and after raising this was simply told we could wait for another- no alternative offered. Staff in bar unhelpful and rude. Food was good in bar but barely made up for an afternoon of horrific service. 
Doorman at night questioned if residents- but not the older couple in front of us. 
Bed and pillows- quite uncomfortable. 
The Shelborne has nothing to be worried about with this hotel as it doesn't come close to service. 
Very disappointing for this 5* hotel. ",3,2016,06,01
206,Super Hotel,"Great Service, you wouldn't know you are in the middle of Dublin city -- very peaceful.
Rooftop bar is the best I've seen - Lovely treat
Will have to make more use of the hotel facilities next time - hopefully soon!",5,2016,06,01
206,Luxurious Hotel,The hotel is very well situated for the Bord Gais Energy Theatre and is a comfortable 20 minute walk from Grafton Street.  The facilities are excellent and the staff were very pleasant and helpful.  Unseasonably warm weather in Dublin helped too!,4,2016,06,01
206,Excellent hotel with friendly helpful staff,"Only stayed for one night, so didn't get the chance to use all the facilities. Very modern hotel which was very clean. The staff were friendly & helpful. The hotel is in the theatre district, if you're going to Croke park you do need to get taxis or use public transport, all of which are handy.",5,2016,06,01
206,"Superb, luxurious & extra special hotel",We stayed here recently for our 5th wedding anniversary.  From the moment of arrival the hotel & their staff went beyond expectations.  Little personal touches such as a cake to our room topped it off.  Wow!,5,2016,06,01
206,Girls weekend,"I will be back. Now that I know about the carpark the arrival will be smoother! 
Sorry to say but the bar is slow and lack lustre in character. Please remove the awful net curtains and consider a window reflection treatment instead?!",4,2016,05,31
206,What a great hotel,"What a great hotel. Very clean. Amazing views of canal basin. Air conditioning was great in the Dublin heatwave. The staff are incredibly well trained and could not do enough for us. Highly recommended. The hotel and immediate surrounds are modern and trendy. The only negative is the distance from the main tourist area of Dublin. It took a good 30 mins to walk (I am on the slow side) and you can go along the river or through some streets (some a bit run-down). However, if this hotel was nearer the centre I would not be able to afford it. The roof bar was closed for our whole stay. ",5,2016,05,31
206,Amazing hotel,"Beautifully decorated with flowers,modern, excellent staff, gorgeous pool and delightful rooftop bar, I had a great pleasure to spend their weekends!!!I recommend to all!!!happy to spend another weekend there!!",5,2016,05,31
206,amazing hotel,"We stayed here as we got a gift voucher for 2 nights bed and breakfast and 1 evening meal.  To say we were delighted was an understatement.  From the moment the taxi pulled up until we left we were very well looked after.  Hotel gorgeous, room amazing, staff exceptional and variety of food and drink plentiful.  Would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely be back. ",5,2016,05,30
206,"Well-located, great business hotel","Just spent 5 days and nights at this property and was really favorably impressed.  The staff are welcoming and very professional, the rooms are large and well-appointed and the brasserie serves a quite decent breakfast.  The bar area is wildly popular and a fun meeting place.  Highly recommended for business travelers, particularly those needing access to the CCD.  The Marker is within walking distance of the city center, and there are plenty of cabs nearby.",5,2016,05,30
206,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed at The Marker in Dublin and found the staff to be incredibly professional and helpful, from the time we arrived, to valet parking, to departing!  The rooms were spotless, as was the whole Hotel.  The rooms were very quiet, and very conducive to a great night's sleep!  We enjoyed the wonder breakfast buffet, as well as dinner and/or drinks in Lounge at night!  We especially enjoyed the coffee we could take in the car after breakfast, and not having to stop in our travels to pick some up.  I would definitely recommend this Hotel for a relaxing, enjoyable and amazing stay!  I will return!",5,2016,05,30
206,Awesome,"Great location, great staff.  The room was huge and had a great comfortable bed!  Didn't manage to have a drink on the roof Gardner but heard great things about it.  Ordered room service which came really quickly, can't say anything bad about the stay!",5,2016,05,30
206,Great hotelin a new neighbourhood,"New hotel in a new part of the city. Service is excellent, very comfortable rooms with no-code wifi connection. A couple of trendy restaurants close by. The hotel bar is vibrant, sometimes difficult to find a place to seat!",5,2016,05,30
206,A little dissapointing - but overall ok,"We stayed for 2 nights on a business trip. Had to wait for our rooms to be cleaned. Where offered complimentary drinks, took 15 minutes to get them. Over all a good hotel but lacked that extra mile that other hotels in the area have. Very highly priced also.",3,2016,05,29
206,Best Bellini's of Dublin,"Beautiful hotel with a fabulous lobby and bar / restaurant area. I went here often after work for some drinks. Their Bellini, my favourite drink, they just understand. Great ambiance, chique. When the weather is good: go to their rooftop terrace. I went there a few times, but the weather was not that great. I can imagine that on a sunny day, it has to be fab. The hotel attracts tourists, but many locals visit the place as well.

I also went for a spa treatment (face). What can I say: super super luxurious, professional and the lady who took care of me, was so lovely! Highly recommend their spa treatment as well.",5,2016,05,29
206,Great hotel in a great location. Staff and Amenities superb.,"Was at the Marker Hotel for one night. My expectations were high and I was NOT disappointed.

Arrived early, so was able to use the on site pool and gym until my room was ready.  Reception left a voicemail saying that my room was ready for occupation. The hotel was very busy at the time of my visit so did not expect early check in availability.Room was very well appointed with a view over the square. Nice bathroom and associated toiletries.

Breakfast was lovely with great choice. (Cooked / Cereal / Fruit / Juices etc). Staff great and attentive.

Easy to walk (20 Minutes) from Dublin centre to the hotel.",5,2016,05,29
206,Great hotel!!,"The Marker is a great hotel that is located near central Dublin. (You can walk to the spire that marks the middle of Dublin in approx. 15-20 min.) Our room was comfortable, clean, and just over-all fantastic. I had told the hotel that my husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and someone brought us a celebratory dessert, which was a tasty surprise. Our room had a view of the water and the square at the front of the hotel. My only complaint: If you are driving yourself around Dublin, this hotel is impossible to find. Our GPS could get us close to the hotel, but not to the front of the hotel where drop off and valet was. That aside, our time at The Market was flawless! ",5,2016,05,28
206,Very 5 star all the way,"Stayed here on business with colleagues. 

The hotel seems reasonably new and the rooms are nicely styled. I had a view to the Canal side, which was very impressive in the evening lighting. The bed was excellent with nice pillows, and if needed you could have changed them to a different type on request. Very spacious bathroom with both shower and bathtub. Only thing I was wondering was the missing of the hand piece on the shower. Rooms were also very quiet, and with the thick curtains you can make it totally dark. Great sleep quality.

Breakfast was very high quality and service there as well very good. Whenever you had finished your plate someone was there to clean it away without it feeling too hasty. 

The cleaning was done with a nice touch and the bathroom cosmetics refilled each day. 

As we arrived before the rooms were ready our luggage was taken to the luggage room and delivered to the room without separate request. Reception also notified by calling when the room for you was ready. Very nice touch. As I stayed in the city after the checkout time the service when picking up luggage later on was equally good. 

Really nothing to complain.",5,2016,05,27
206,Popular Place ,"This is a very popular place. The interior has a very modern feel and the service is top notch. The location is perfect for pedestrian explorers and is within walking distance of the convention center. The public square across from the hotel is always lively and there are several restaurants near by, however, the food served at The Marker was very good so don't overlook this option. 

The rooms are modern and well accommodated. Very comfortable. The heated bathroom floors are very nice. I would certainly consider staying here again in the future. ",5,2016,05,27
206,Most enjoyable stay ever,"I have to say my stay in the Marker Hotel is more than excellent, everything is great! I was stay there with my best friend for my leaving occasion, and we got a beautiful decorated desert on our arrival, all the employees there are very helpful and friendly. Facilities in the spa is really good, love the dark and luxury poor where we had a very relaxed and enjoyable time. The Rooftop bar is our favourite part, as the atmosphere, the view and the cocktail are all excellent, the service we got there is 5 stars, gentleman Derek who helped us to arrange the seats under our tight timetable and gave us lots of other help to enhance our experience!! We had a great time in the Marker Hotel, and I'd highly recommend it!",5,2016,05,26
206,Best Hotel Stay Ever,"I cannot say enough good things about the Marker Hotel. My husband and I stayed a night in Dublin for some quick sight seeing, and this hotel was probably my favorite part of our stay. This hotel is beautiful, clean, and very accommodating. My only regret is that we didn't stay longer. ",5,2016,05,26
206,Nice Hotel,"Overall a very luxurious place to stay. Little pricey on the money side but with the accommodations I saw why. Rooftop bar closed a bit early for me so I never saw it. The spa massage was booked my entire trip, so I was unable to get one. These are my only complaints. ",5,2016,05,26
206,"Outstanding hotel, fantastic service","Visiting our daughter, who now lives in Dublin, we chose the Marker after reading reviews and recommendations.  In summary, an absolutely excellent hotel for the job.  Clean, tidy, and luxurious without being ostentatious or over-the-top in any way.  Superb service and amazing staff throughout.  Will definitely return next time we're visiting.",5,2016,05,25
206,5 Star Service!,"Amazing stay in a very luxurious hotel, staff were incredibly accomodating and friendly. The Spa was a little piece of heaven in the centre of a busy city. The Rooftop Bar was beautiful with very friendly staff and lots of choices on their menu, they even provided Mocktails for the pregnant woman in our party. Will definitely be staying again in the near future. Unfortunately, the Pre Theatre Menu was very limited and the staff could not provide a different menu for us to pay the normal prices for a wider selection, the only minus point to our otherwise fantastic stay.",5,2016,05,25
206,Loved this hotel!,"The Marker was beautiful, elegant, and comfortable. The room were spacious and lovely. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We loved every minute of our time here. Dublin was an easy walk from this location. ",5,2016,05,24
206,Excellent Experience,"Stayed for a birthday celebration and they attended to our every need seamlessly. Great staff, wonderful food. Couldn't ask for anything better. Would absolutely highly recommend and will stay here again.",5,2016,05,24
206,Modern ,"We stayed as a family for 4 days. From the moment we arrived the door man was helpful and courteous. The bedroom is spacious and we had a great view of  the lake and court yard. The hotel has a wellness center and a pool. We enjoyed a message manicure and pedicure. The pool only has specific hours for kids that were inconvenient. 
When we checked in our hostess was overly quiet giving us our room information. We asked her repeatedly to speak up. She never did. She actually seemed to whisper. Which was annoying since there were several other people being checked in and we could only hear them. Our bed was not the most comfortable for such a nice hotel. It was just ok. The bathroom is very large and extremely nice.  We would probably stay here again. ",4,2016,05,24
206,"Fantastic Hotel, Location and Staff","First time stay but hopefully not the last didn't get to the rooftop bar as there was a private function on but cant wait to return wonderful hotel, the food was beautiful, the hotel is a hive of activity loved it!",5,2016,05,24
206,"Great place, great people","Stayed at the marker hotel for business, but what a nice place to stay. The staff was friendly and professional, The room service was really nice even in the early mornings. 
Nothing else to say than I will go back to this hotel next time in Dublin. ",5,2016,05,24
206,Excellent accommodations in the center of it all!,"The Marker is very elegant and comfortable, and in an excellent location with it's close proximity to the theatre and general walking distance to many of the key spots in Dublin.  The rooms are spacious and very welcoming, offering plenty of comfort to get rested after walking Dublin!",5,2016,05,23
206,Weekend get away,"We booked the marker hotel as it was rated in the top 5 reviews on trip advisor! The service is second to none. The staff are really friendly and will do anything to assist. Our room was located at the back of the hotel. It over looked another buildings wall. So was a little disappointing. The room was immaculate and not a spec of dust anywhere. The breakfast is expensive at ‚Ç¨25 per person. You are best to head over the road or go to Starbucks round the corner. The location is slightly off the beaten track for the temple bar and main shopping areas. It takes about 25 minutes walk to the temple bar. There is a roof bar that is a must visit! Cocktails about ‚Ç¨15 each, but you get a few nibbles to go with them. We did get woken up one morning by a fire alarm going off, this was a false alarm but the staff could not reset it. So had to rush getting dressed. Found out to be a faulty water sprinkler that had gone off in someone's room on our floor, our room them had a funny burn smell for a bit after. The pool and spa was nice and relaxing. Inside the hotel there is a dark lighting effect. A bit dull in places. I would recommend the hotel, but not for stag or hen parties! ",4,2016,05,22
206,Great hotel with a very friendly staff.,Great hotel with great staff and very good athmosphere. Rooms were great and very clean. Breakfast was great. rooftop bar excellent. Well situated and close to good restauarants and bars. I will come back again.,5,2016,05,22
206,Great modern hotel,"The Marker is a very well appointed, comfortable hotel in a relatively non-touristy area of Dublin. Only a 10-15 minute walk to the Temple Bar area, we appreciated being away from the noisy tourist areas, but still had access to great restaurants and all the sights. Rooms are spacious, new and clean, staff is very friendly and accommodating. ",5,2016,05,22
206,Excellent!!!,The hotel & facilities were excellent maybe the best hotel in Dublin I have stayed in both for business & pleasure! Location is prefect to get to city. Would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone going. ,5,2016,05,22
206,Top notch service at the Marker,The staff at the Marker are the best!  I arrived with an injury and they went above and beyond to help and be kind.  Their first aider was very confident and competent and all the staff helped me throughout my stay. Thank you Marker!,5,2016,05,21
206,Relaxation at its best,From arrival to departure you are made to feel really important and very welcome. A really nice room with views over the Grand canal.  An afternoon matinee in the Bord Gais theatre and back to the rooftop bar for a relaxing drink whilst taking in the views. Dinner in their fine dining restuarant was beautiful. Couldnt find fault - even if you were looking,5,2016,05,20
206,Mid week Break,"What a wonderful experience. Everything was perfect. The staff are all so helpful especially our table attendant in the bar, Wilson, he was fantastic and made us feel so welcome and couldn't do enough to make our stay even better. He was so friendly and helpful. A lovely young man. Thank you Wilson. Thank you all in the Marker Hotel. Cant wait to return for more 5 star treatment. We were made to feel very special during our stay.  Wonderful!!",5,2016,05,20
206,Mid week break,"Excellent hotel, perfectly situated. From check-in to check-out the service was first class. The room was very comfortable and the staff extremely friendly. The breakfast was the best I've ever had. Would highly recommend the Marker.",5,2016,05,20
206,Average Stay for Honeymoon,"Large room, very clean but nothing was really above & beyond anything else we experienced at other hotels. We chose The Marker for our last night in Dublin on our honeymoon. I honestly expected something (little) special because it was our honeymoon & it was noted when booking. It felt like any other hotel stay. It was cool and convenient to make reservations for their Brassiere & Rooftop Bar via email. Easy to get to from the train station. We scheduled a wake up call and they were actually about 15 minutes late, so I'm glad we also set an alarm. Really cool to be across from the Bord Gais Theater, it's a beautiful place. ",5,2016,05,18
206,Perfect post Easter treat,"We stayed here for one night over the Easter break. The room was spacious, really comfortable bed and amazing views of Dublin.  Staff were attentive and helpful. While there was plenty of choice on offer for breakfast, the bacon and sausages were slightly disappointing but I guess that's the downside of a buffet breakfast.  We both used the spa which was a real treat. Amazing facials.  The hotel is in the docklands area of the city which is a short walk from the city centre. Overall, a great experience.",4,2016,05,18
206,"Great hotel, roof top bar is a must","Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights during a real sunny weekend in Dublin. The rooms are very spacious and well presented. The roof top bar is fantastic, great views of London all while you are having your favourite drink. The breakfast was also superb, lots of choice and good service. The fresh juices went down really well.

The location is about 15-20 minute walk into town, it is an interesting walk as you go past parts of Dublin that do not represent the area that the hotel is in. Didn't feel as though it would be a problem though.",5,2016,05,17
206,Amazing,"The hotel is perfect for business stay or few nights get away. Immaculate clean, friendly staff, comfortable beds. However, the best part of the hotel is Terrace, breathtaking Dublin views, drinking Bollinger on white sofas and extremely friendly staff offering extraordinary service. Worth a visit. 
Thank you.",5,2016,05,17
206,Perfect pre theatre meal,"This was simply the perfect start to a night with friends in An Bord Gais .The staff were so helpful and friendly
. We were there at 5 30 which meant there was no rush.
The food portion was just right and so tasty.
i would return for that rhubarb dessert alone
.Heres to the next time",5,2016,05,17
206,Excellent,"Modern luxury without pretentiousness. Lovely views of canal. Rooftop bar with great views over the city, a bit cold for May but staff were quick to offer blankets. Location is a bit away from the main shopping area.

",5,2016,05,17
206,Beautiful hotel but you certainly pay for it!,"Lovely modern hotel which is located beside the Bord Gais Theatre. 

The rooms are a really good size and are spotless. Bed very comfortable. The bathroom was gorgeous having both a separate bath and shower. The bathroom also had heated flooring which was a nice touch. 

The Restaurant in the hotel was not up to the same quality as the rooms. I wasn't very impressed with the steak and it was slightly overcooked for the medium I had suggested. I expected a gourmet dinner cooked to perfection for the 5 star standard of the hotel and the 100 euro we paid which was only for our main courses and a few drinks. Breakfast the next morning also wasn't really worth getting up for in my opinion. It was a buffet breakfast and  would have thought it would have been a cooked as requested breakfast.

The staff were undoubtedly very polite and helpful throughout the stay. Parking wasn't included and it was quite expensive on top of the cost of the room. I think in my head i kept thinking for the price of this room I could have gone abroad for a few nights. Saying that the rooms are gorgeous and for a splurge night away they are fabulous. Just maybe eat somewhere else in the city.",4,2016,05,17
206,"Beautiful hotel, but with food under par","The design of the hotel is remarkable, and the roof top bar is excellent if the weather is nice! Friendly staff that are very helpful. Unfortunately we got poor and slow service both times we visited the bar on the ground floor. Also the food in the Brasserie (hotel restaurant) was not at all up to the standards of the hotel or matching the price! The deluxe room was very big and delicate, but the air  conditioning dit not suffice, so we slept poorly because the room was so hot during the night.",4,2016,05,17
206,Very disappointing at the Marker,"Room was fine. Nothing special. Clean and comfortable. Nice bathroom. Small wardrobe / closet space. 

Breakfast was abysmal. Cooked breakfast was buffet style and food had been left languishing in bain maries for ages- rubbery eggs and lukewarm  meats which were of very mediocre catering supply quality. Surely a hotel charging this much could freshly cook good quality sausages, pudding etc. Toast did not arrive until we had given up on the cooked items. When it did arrive, it was burnt.

When I asked at reception if I could cancel breakfast from our booking for the following morning as it was not an experience we wanted to repeat, it was told it was impossible as it was included in our ""rate"". I told them that we were quoted a rate and then offered parking and breakfast as extras so surely if it was added on, it could be taken off. Eventually, they agreed albeit with no apology for or interest in our disappointment with breakfast that morning. 

On arrival, we had planned to go into town after checking in so I did not avail of valet parking. I asked where to park and on entry to  the car park later that evening, had to provide a credit card. Reception told me that I had gone into the wrong car park entrance but not to worry, they would credit back any charges when I was checking out. We came and went a few times the following day but at check out was told (for the first time) that they would only credit back charges before we left the car park and nothing could be done about earlier charges amounting to ‚Ç¨50 or thereabouts. I had to argue that the guy never told us that when we checked in and eventually, they agreed to credit it back  on the bill. Again, this was done ungraciously. 

Overall, it's a nice enough hotel building in a convenient location but that has, perhaps, allowed them to be lazy regarding food quality and customer service. Certainly not a five star experience and would not recommend to anyone. ",2,2016,05,17
206,Lovely roof top bar,"This a nice hotel in a good location in the city centre. I am a local and stayed here as a treat with my other half when we went to see a show in the Bord Gais Theatre. We were let check in early without fuss. The roof top bar is stunning on a sunny day, but there can be queues. Thankfully they give residents priority. Our room was very clean and comfortable, as was the very large bathroom. The pool and relaxation area were beautiful and clean too. We were a little disappointed with breakfast - the 'full Irish' was precooked and tepid. Dinner in the Brassiere was nice, however we didn't like the layout. The table we were at was really close to the two either side, and we had no privacy. I think over the hotel is a little pricey for what you get compared to other hotels in its class",4,2016,05,17
206,Weekend break,"Lovely hotel, service and spa was excellent. Breakfast was fantastic! Had a room at the front with great views. The only Disappointment was that we were not told to book the rooftop bar and therefore didn't get to use or experience it",5,2016,05,17
206,4 days break in Dublin,"Very good hotel with great service but quite expensive. It is not in the city center but at a walking distance to Temple Bar, Trinity College and shopping √°reas. Rooms and facilities are modern, clean and comfortable. We would repeat the experience. ",4,2016,05,17
206,One of the best hotels I've stayed in,"Modern, clean, VERY quiet (possibly the only hotel where I can sleep without ear plugs!), friendly and professional staff. I always stay in this hotel when traveling to Dublin and recommend to anyone I know. ",5,2016,05,16
206,Impeccable service,"Simply the best hotel I've stayed in Ireland. The guys in the breakfast area were so kind and felt so looked after. Great service, nice roof top bar, amazing spa and very well located. Will definitely consider staying at this hotel again next time I visit Dublin. 
",5,2016,05,16
206,10/10,"Highly recommend! Fantastic location, great beds, wonderful bathroom, beautiful spa, helpful staff, delicious breakfast. Stayed for business and almost felt like a night away - really hope I get to go back here again sometime soon..",5,2016,05,16
206,Very good standard,"It's the cheapest of hotels. But you get what you pay for. Make sure ur pocket is full and the roof top bar is the place to have one the most romantic evenings. Very friendly staff. In a nutshell, everything you expect from a 5 star hotel, it has it. Location, facilities, experience, the feeling of Luxury.. Enjoy!!",5,2016,05,15
206,great price-performance ratio,"Very modern, stylish hotel in situated in an attractive area of Dublin. Great roof-top bar with a phantastic view over Dublin and the landscape. Rooms are very comfortable with a spacious bathroom. Attractive view from the room to the water.",5,2016,05,15
206,Best of Dublin,"Amazing 24hours in Dublin!  We arrived very early and were welcomed and given a room immediately. We were very grateful. It was an amazing experience to stay at such a beautiful hotel, right in the heart of Dublin. Can't wait to come back!",5,2016,05,14
206,Dublin visit,"We checked in after a long trip. Excellent front of house service and attention from the bellman to the front desk. Room was excellent, bed comfy and access to Dublin easy. Would stay there again in a heartbeat.",5,2016,05,14
206,Down to earth luxury,"This hotel and staff were nothing but excellent in making me feel at home and welcome in very luxurios surroundings. Room was neat and nice, and both dinner and breakfast was outstanding. When travelling it is nice to have a hotel you look forward coming back to after a day of Work or explring the city - and this hotel definetly made me look forward to coming back ""home"". The pool and gym were also exquisite. ",5,2016,05,14
206,Dublin Dixie chicks concert visit,"Great hotel stunning building service excellent , food and bev top quality , staff very good only issue is the showers or at least in my room.
Unless you are 5.6 or over you can not reach the shower head to adjust and coupled with a lack of a hand shower unit it's not great for such a brilliant hotel.",4,2016,05,14
206,Perfect,It was the best stay I have ever had at a hotel. If I'm ever back in Ireland I don't want to stay anywhere else. The staff was so accomidating and respectful. I loved the robes and the room service. I have no complaints and if I did I would put them here but I don't.,5,2016,05,13
206,Overnight stay,"The Marker is a beautiful hotel, from the moment we arrived until we left, we were treated with respect and courtesy, nothing was too much trouble. My car was whisked off as I had pre-booked valet parking and promptly returned with 2 bottles of water for the long journey home. it was a most pleasant stay, the food is gorgeous and we felt we had excellent value for money. ",5,2016,05,13
206,Wonderful Customer Service,"The entire staff is great, very welcoming and pleasant.  They cater to every ask, have complimentary umbrellas which frankly is great as a traveler not wanting to carry extra items, and will find you a taxi that takes credit/debit cards which much to our surprise is not standard in Dublin.  The rooms are very clean.  Breakfast adequate and fast.  The gym is only open until 9:30 pm which doesn't work for the busy business traveler to work out late but is a great facility with lots of equipment and a pool!  Highly recommend staying at the Marker.",5,2016,05,13
206,The Mark Of Excellence,"What a terrific hotel. Everything is five star. Very chilled out Spa area. Beautiful steam room and Sauna with loungers by the elegant pool. As ever the staff make the difference. All the staff. The cleaners, front desk, restaurant - all top notch. I had a memorable and  enjoyable stay. 

Only major problem was I forgot to have a half of Guinness whilst in Dublin. Unforgivable.",5,2016,05,12
206,"Excellent, modern hotel but not downtown","Excellent, modern hotel but it is in the newly developed docklands area, about 10-15 minutes' cab ride away from downtown. Large, modern room. Nice pool for laps. Friendly staff, but then everyone in Ireland is friendly!",5,2016,05,12
206,one night in grand canal,"We were really pleased with the hotel  as it was  a late booking  We .Had an  Amazing room on the  6th floor. Was so  quiet, immaculate clean with  lovely view from the large window.
Friendly helpful staff From the doorman to reception to bar staff. Also its an  Ideal location - 15 minute walk to the 3 Arena.",5,2016,05,11

206,Best hotel in Dublin,"I stay in The Marker a lot for business and having stayed in a lot of hotels in Dublin, I can without doubt sayt that the Marker is the best.  

The service is very professional but friendly and the atmosphere, quality of accommodation, pool is great.  

Highly recommend for business and pleasure.  Our kids have stayed with us a few time and are always asking when they can return......",5,2016,05,11
206,Luxury at its best.,"Love the look of this  luxurious  hotel 
Had all I needed and would definitely stay again though I think it is a very modern cosmopolitan stay nice and warm homely hotel but very very bang on trend....  The spa is out of this world. 
Breakfast fit for a King ..... ",5,2016,05,11
206,Definitely recommended,Stayed with friends over the bh and had a great night. Had the le Drunch and cocktails in the brasserie and the service and food were excellent. Then headed to the rooftop bar... Great views but the service was lacking and the margaritas were terrible.... Had to ask for a salt rim and they did it without a fresh glass! The rooms are lovely and spacious with everything you'd expect from a 5 star. Room service was fab. Would definitely recommend!,5,2016,05,11
206,Excellent Stay,"Stayed in Dublin for two nights over NYE. Room was excellent; modern, spacious and had all the mod cons needed. Large comfortable bed and the option to change your pillow type to more than I even knew existed. Bathroom was equally fantastic with a brilliant shower and luxurious large bath. Staff were very attentive and helpful. Hotel and spa facilities were lovely. Location wise it was good and within walking distance to the city centre. If heading a little further, the hotel can easily arrange a taxi. Would recommend!",5,2016,05,10
206,Weekend break,"Spent the last weekend in this hotel, in the Schwartz suite for my wife's 30th.. Amazing room,hotel,location and overall experience. Best 5 star hotel I've ever stayed in. Will definitely return. Oh and the staff where brilliant , especially the door man 'barry'",5,2016,05,10
206,Sheer escapism!,"Ideal for our sister/girlie get together and concert going. Nothing too much for the staff, everything taken care of immediately, all staff pleasant and engaging. Service from front door to reception to catering was 5* without exception",5,2016,05,10
206,My stay in the marker,I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It is located in a very nice place and is walking distance of the city. And for us is was only a few mins walk from the bus stop which was a no as for us with our bags ,5,2016,05,10
206,"Great staff, interesting loaction","I usually stay at the Westbury when in Dublin.  At first the Marker was a bit of a shock to the system, modern, contemporary and all in all so different.

My superior canal facing room was however lovely, with a great view.  The sleep comfort was top notch and the bathroom modern and tasteful.  Loved the mini bar that was accessible via a ""cupboard"".

Breakfast was decent and we had a great meal in the Brasserie.

Each and every staff member was efficient and super helpful.  There is a fabulous swimming pool for those that like to do proper swim training.",5,2016,05,10
206,Perfect,From the front door to the rooftop bar the staff are excellent and the hotel itself the location the views the rooms are beautiful. If you can I urge you to book one of the luxury suite's they are amazing.,5,2016,05,10
206,Marker Hotel review,Stayed here on business. Was a great location and the staff and service was outstanding. Couldn't imagine a better place to stay for business or personal reasons. Breakfast was great but a little pricy. ,5,2016,05,10
206,Excellent,This hotel is above & beyond anything ive ever experienced i cannot recommend it enough every staff member was exceptional service was second to none i cannot wait to go back from check in to check out the experience was flawless,5,2016,05,10
206,Top notch hotel,"The Marker is an excellent 5 star hotel (or should be) with all the amenities. For North America visitors, there is an appropriate electric plug (no converter needed) - nice touch! The heated floors in the bathroom are lovely and the bed is very comfortable. Staff were great, as was room service. I loved my stay!",5,2016,05,10
206,Great Hotel,I really enjoed my stay at the Marker Hotel. The staff were excellent and very helpful and the rooms were extremely comfortable and spacious.I would definately recommend and will stay again. Nice walk into town approx 20 minutes.,5,2016,05,10

206,Excellent staff go the extra mile,"Very pleasant stay. We were disappointed with difficulty getting to roof terrace which we were looking  forward to.I feel priority should be given to guests.  The swimming pool area is really lovely with.                   
delightful staff. Hotel is very modern. Ideal for visit to Bord Gais theatre.",5,2016,05,09
206,I love this hotel,I love this hotel it is top class. From the minute you check in to leaving it is all 5* service.. Rooms are the best i have stayed in in Ireland yet..  I had a very enjoyable stay & will definetly be returning. ,5,2016,05,09
206,thanks.,"The heater should be extended to room as well, as its available only in bathroom. The overall stay was comfortable, the kitchen attached to the bar counter had Indian delicacy, but should have more Veg options in both kitchens.",5,2016,05,09
206,Four Star Offering at Five Star Prices,The hotel is in the docklands business district which is dead at weekends and there is nothing to see or do in the immediate vicinity unless you are attending the theatre opposite. Walking to the city centre is feasible but you will likely prefer to take taxis. The building is modern and open plan which makes for a fairly soul less experience. There is one bar area in the foyer which doubles as casual dining located at the main door so it fails to offer a relaxing environment. When this gets busy you can expect a long wait for service.  there is a roof terrace which we tried to get to three times on the Friday evening but were told each time it was full but if we took a seat we would be invited up. The invite never arrived. Rooms are large and well equipped in a minimalistic style but cool even on the highest heat setting. Overall the hotel offers a reasonable standard but falls well short of its 5 star aspiration so leaves the impression of being overcharged. ,3,2016,05,09
206,Gum Ball horror,"Stayed at the hotel whilst they stupidly decided to host the gumball rally.
Lots of rude idiots in the bar and reception area making any form of hotel enjoyment impossible. Then to add insult to injury, had to put up with revving engines from some ridiculous time on Saturday morning.
Utterly ridiculous that a hotel would host an event like this and not warn other guests.",1,2016,05,09
206,Just excellent!,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Marker hotel. Everything was perfect: the hotel is well spotted, the services was great, the rooms very conformtable and spacious and I had a great experience at the rooftop bar. I'm really looking forward to coming back to Dublin and enjoyed a stay at the Marker hotel. ",5,2016,05,08
206,excellent hotel for business trip,"had a very nice stay during 2 nights. Beautiful and big room & bathroom. Nice modern look with very friendly service. If you want to be in the very center of the city, take care that it is a 20 minutes walk to the Temple Bar. The area around the Marker Hotel is clean, modern and new part of Dublin City.",5,2016,05,08
206,Disappointed customers,We said we would treat ourselves and stay in the Marker for 1 night. It was a total disappointment. Over priced & equally poor service particularly at breakfast. My partner was recovering from surgery which he had as a result of a road traffic accident the previous week. We really needed a night away in luxury. The cost of food in the bar was totally overpriced. The staff forgot to bring a number of items to our table and we had to ask again. I ordered a gl of red wine( i was presented with a dash of wine) for ‚Ç¨10 this was really disappointing. We were charged ‚Ç¨43 for breakfast which wasnt included in our room rate of ‚Ç¨250. Breakfast was the most disappointing part. As I mentioned my partner had surgery on his hand & the staff were not attentive.  It was a buffet style breakfast and we were not offered the option to be served at our table due to Sean's temporary disability. I had to go up with Sean and organise his breakfast from the buffet. Then eventually my order was taken and I waited 25 minutes for my pancakes&berries. ‚Ç¨21.50  each for a full irish&my pancakes a berries!! An absolute rip off. We have received better service in B&Bs. Then the parking of ‚Ç¨24 which actually turned out to be the best value for money as we were able to leave our car there on the Friday while we visited local historical sites. Our overall stay cost us a little less than ‚Ç¨400. The room was nice and quiet. Upon check out not one of the staff asked if we enjoyed our stay which gave us no opportunity to share our disappointment.,2,2016,05,08
206,Nice business hotel,"Nice hotel for business. Longer walking distance through sketchy area for tourist area. Count on using taxis. 

The room was not ready after the check in time for us and several other guests. 

The staff were outstanding, the rooms clean and well-appointed. 

The breakfast was very good but quite pricey.",4,2016,05,08
206,Excellent hotel,"Excellent service, great room, comfortable bed, great bathroom, good but overpriced breakfast 

Check in could have been better, had to wait for ages as it seemed receptionist was answering long query about some function booking on the phone, surely f2f with customers should be a priority ",5,2016,05,08
206,Great quality city hotel ,"Stayed on business, so didn't have the opportunity to make use of the spa, but couldn't fault the hotel. 

Reception staff very friendly and helpful, room was very comfortable, as was the bed. Nice touches, like turn down service and slippers ready by each side of the bed 

Simple useful things like multi country power plugs. 

Bathroom large with separate large shower and bath, well decorated. Good nights sleep. Only criticism was the very bright glow from the blue digital clock on the front of the TV, eventually had to find something to cover it. 

Breakfast was excellent, great choices, beautifully prepared but thought the buffet cooked over priced at ¬£25

All in all very good, will return. ",5,2016,05,07
206,"Great hotel, great city!","Had a weekend break away for my partners birthday and couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. 
The service was great, and although it was April we had a beautiful night on the rooftop bar, where the staff were amazing! 
Will definitely be back! ",5,2016,05,07
206,Convenient and stylish,The Marker is a very comfortable hotel that is well located for the business district of Dublin. The bar area is well served and the rooms are well appointed. I do think that the hotel is expensive when compared to other hotels in the immediate area.,4,2016,05,07
206,avoid the Gumball rally,"Stayed at the Marker again over the Bank Holiday.  Unfortunately, when I went they had the start of the Gumball car rally.  The place was so busy and noisy that I avoided the bar whilst they were there.  which is why I have only given it three stars this time.  The service was slightly down, but once the rally people had gone, it got back up to the usual Marker standard.

The hotel also has a lovely swimming pool, which I used a few times.

Breakfast is not included, but reception offered me a good deal to include the breakfast, when I explained that there was one day where I did not have breakfast they took the charge off

The staff were all friendly and helpful. They even telephoned me the day before I arrived to say that if there was anything I needed to get in touch.  I will defiantly go back to the Marker again",3,2016,05,07
206,Very modern and very cool.,"Very modern, contemporary with a decent gym (for a hotel) and a terrific pool. Absolutely everything needed for a quick business trip. The breakfast is excellent and the coffee means business. There is also good coffee in the room which is great if you're on Asia time. The room service food was also excellent. The staff were all super helpful and very friendly. The only thing that makes this not a five star rating is the service in the lounge bar area downstairs on a crowded Friday evening is pretty dismal. I will definitely make this my go to hotel in Dublin.",4,2016,05,07
206,Perfect,Stayed here recently while attending a show in the Bord Gais Theatre. Location and breakfast is really good and you're not far from Grafton St area if you want to shop or dine. Valet parking is very effective. The swimming pool is spotless. I would stay here again and have recommended it to friends ,5,2016,05,06
206,Perfect,Loved the Marker. They really went above and beyond for us down to every last little detail. The staff are so friendly and helpful ! The Room Service was so quick and the food was lovely! We got a front facing room on the 2nd floor and the view was fab all lit up. It is about ‚Ç¨8.00 in a taxi to Dame Street which isnt too bad either.,5,2016,05,05
206,Very Chic Ultra Modern,"We stayed at the Marker, which is on the revitalized go go go Grand Canal Square for a night before leaving Ireland.  Super high tech Matrix like feel to the hotel with hyper modern furnishings and black hotel corridors that reinforce the design plan.  Great service and we enjoyed our stay.  Probably not everyone's cup of tea but it was a very beautiful youthful crowd there and in the local restaurants and bars.",4,2016,05,04
206,Review,Outstanding stay- from start to finish. This hotel pays close attention to all of their guests needs and requests. Special thanks to Liam- he is a fabulous asset to the marker hotel.  The roof top is a must!!,5,2016,05,04
206,Exceptional Stay at The Marker,"Beautiful hotel, staff were extremely courteous and could not be more helpful. Location was great but could easily stay within the hotel. The Rooftop Bar was the highlight of our stay. Definitely worth a visit and I will definitely return.",5,2016,05,04
206,Expected more for the price.,"A little underwelming, room was spacious average view, clean. Slightly out of central Dublin. Nothing great with service. Just average for a hotel. Positives there was a lovely breakfast cafe near. Bathroom was very nice and spacious. If you are limited with time it's not central enough.",3,2016,05,03
206,A world class hotel,"Having stayed in great hotels throughout the world, I have to say that the Marker was one of the most outstanding I have experienced for service, efficiency and ambience. What's more, the majority of the staff were Irish!!!! The manager, Charlie Sheil and his staff do an amazing job to make everyone welcome with a combination of Irish hospitality and warmth, plus an international level of efficiency.
Very highly recommended for both leisure and business",5,2016,05,03
206,Get away,"Get away, great location but rooms don't have windows that open, staff great and vey welcoming and helpful didn't eat but the food that I seen was very well presented. The hotel was also clean and very tidy! ",5,2016,05,03
206,My favourite hotel in Dublin,"The Marker is a modern luxury hotel next to the docks, walking distance from the Trinity College - Dublin is a perfect city to walk everywhere, I have to say. My room had a fantastic view, spacious and modern just the way I like it. The crowd is international, between 30 and 40. Great service, especially from Stefan at Front Office who gave me some great tips for bars and restaurants in town. The hotel has a Spa with a 23 metres pool: as I love swimming that made a great difference. The rooftop bar offer the best view over Dublin. ",5,2016,05,02
206,Modern Hotel in Dublin,"Vacation stop in Dublin.  Beautiful, modern hotel. Rooms were spacious and well appointed. Great spa and pool. Only stayed one night but would definitely go back. Staff was professional and knowledgable.",5,2016,05,02
206,Very enjoyable stay at the Marker,"Lovely modern property in a great location . The rooms are a good size , and beautifully laid out. Food is very good. Standout though are the staff in every area of the hotel, professional , friendly and very helpful",5,2016,05,02
206,Hospitality is the key....,"Good modern property with a beautiful view of the canals.  Hospitality is the key...the hotel is blessed with certain good staffs, who know their job well and exactly know how to please the guest.  Being a vegetarian i had a very few options for meal, but the staffs at the Bar Kitchen were ready to customize to my preference.",4,2016,05,02
206,Fantastic 5* stay,"Amazing hotel, fabulous staff and great location.
Would highly recommend a stay here to anyone.
Topped off by the fact that gumball 3000 were departing from the hotel so we got to see some awesome cars as an added bonus! 
",5,2016,05,02
206,Very Modern Hotel a 20 min walk away from the sights,"Its a nice, well styled hotel. The design is interesting for a modern place  The room was spacious and well styled and nice bathroom, we had a room with no view at all 
Breakfast was the normal fare and nothing too special 
The maid left my door open all day, nothing was stolen and the management left me a nice note and half a bottle of red 

It ok but i was not wowed",4,2016,05,02
206,"Nice hotel, shame about the Gumball Rally","I feel a little harsh having to write this review as I feel that the hotel is okay but the impact of them hosting people doing the rally was pretty far reaching.
Crowds outside the front taking photos of cars parked up making it difficult to enter of leave the hotel without being run over by taxis.
Inside the bar and reception areas were packed with people, photographers, groupies etc. It simply felt like a place you didn't want to be and the hotel should have warned guests at the time of booking as like myself, several guests were complaining about the rudeness of the car owners etc.
By far the mist infuriating experience was the sound of revving engines that woke me up and kept me awake. Simply unforgivable! Both to paying guests and to local residents. I want to sleep on a Saturday morning during a leisure city-break, not feel like I am at a race track!
Perhaps the hotel management will think twice the next time the think about hosting such events. It would have made more sense to force the rally to book all their rooms!",2,2016,05,02
206,Good stay,Fancy property this was and at a great location. The room was fairly large and well equipped. Did not try any of the other facilities. Would recommend this place to others willingly for business and pleasure.,5,2016,05,01
206,Business Stay,"Great modern quality hotel in Dublin.
Good location in Dublin near the Docklands.

206,Always excellent,"Lovely hotel, comfortable rooms, really highly trained staff, they go out of their way to make everything smoothly for you.  Cannot find reasons to complain, and for this reason, this hotel is fast becoming my new Dublin base. ",5,2016,04,30
206,Great hotel,Have been here with friends on a couple of occasion. Beautiful hotel very good food and great cocktails. Staff are sharp and polished and service overall is very good. Haven't stayed overnight in the hotel but it's on the hit list! Definitely recommend and the Grand Canal area in general is a really nice place to spend an afternoon with friends!,5,2016,04,30
206,Tasty food,"First time in it when I popped in for lunch recently. Very stylish surroundings. Treated myself to a very nice lunch in from the bar food menu in the foyer. Had a gorgeous burger and chips, followed by a nice  hot chocolate that had tasty toffee pieces and marsh mallow on the side which was very nice and enjoyed. Also had a pint of blackcurrant with my food. When the bill came the very helpful and Pleasant Dev who had served me told me there was no charge for the blackcurrant (small but very nice touch) and the bill was ‚Ç¨22 which all things considered thought it was worth it. Will be back",4,2016,04,30

206,Modern luxurious hotel,Fantastic service in an unusual and avante-garde building in a style to suit the Celtic Tiger property bubble. Love the roof-top cocktail bar and the great (if very five star priced) breakfast spread. Good night's sleep in a very comfortable and spacious room.,5,2016,04,29
206,Business event in Dublin,"This week i joined an HPE business event organised in the market hotel Dublin. A modern hotel which i really liked. The stay was perfect. We had good food, good drinks in a good ambiance. When going to Dublid i would advise this hotel.",4,2016,04,29
206,Great hotel,"Friendly upmarket hotel and not at all 'pretentious' with a good mix of clientele. Very friendly staff and good rooms, nice size room and bed, with tea / coffee making facilities and good views from the front-facing rooms. ",5,2016,04,29
206,Really hit the mark,"We were looking for a relaxing city break with the extra spa perks in Dublin and don't think we could have chosen a better hotel. The service, rooms and pool were a delight and just what we were after. Especially enjoyed the little touches, such as coolers with jugs of water flavoured with fresh fruit at the spa entrance. Ideal after a swim.

While it was a 10-15 minute walk from Dublin city centre, it was quite enjoyable walking by the Liffey or the canal to get back. There was also a excellent little cafe round the corner called Lolly and Cooks, which does a super breakfast, coffee, pastries and lunch.",5,2016,04,29
206,Felt so special,I can honestly say this was the best hotel experience I've had in a very long time. From the minute I pulled up in my car I felt like I was the only person in the hotel. Everyone made me feel so special and considering my stay was a treat for my birthday the service I received was the perfect gift. I've been singing this hotels praises since I've come home and everyone wants to visit now :) ,5,2016,04,28
206,"Fab weekend at a high end, but relaxed hotel","A fab hotel with very attentive, helpful staff. Great rooms, great service and and we didn't even make it out beyond the cocktail bar the first night! Can't comment on the food apart from the breakfast which was promptly delivered, and delicious! Thank you Marker! We'll be back! ",5,2016,04,28
206,Great modern hotel!,"The Marker is a great, modern hotel with knowledgable staff. The rooms are beautiful and state of the art. I would definitely recommend the Marker for weekend stays, business and their restaurants for a great meal. ",5,2016,04,28
206,Fab hotel,Rooftop wasn't open which was disappointing but everything else was incredible. Quite expensive but that's to be expected of a 5 star hotel. Lovely location and staff. Would definitely go again. .....,5,2016,04,28
206,Marker April,Good but expensive. Pleasant staff. Problems getting luggage to room. Eventually had to retrieve myself despite calls to reception. Roof bar not open to public - again!  This happens often. Bar prices towards top end. ,4,2016,04,28
206,Great hotel for business trip,"Great room, large bathroom with bathtub, good bed, nice environment, delicious breakfast, good coffee. Great drinks in bar. Good atmosphere for informal business meetings in the reception area. Good service",5,2016,04,27
206,Really wonderful,"We had a room on the 6th floor - very comfortable, quiet, and pleasant.  The bathroom was fantastic.  The service was overall excellent, although it was less consistent in the lounge area.  We ate there one night and the meal took quite a while - however they immediately offered our first round of drinks on the house.  Another day we waited a bit of time for drinks - but both of these instances were not major inconveniences by any means. We had drinks on the roof deck one evening and loved it.  We also spent time in the pool area which was, no surprise, fabulous.  The doormen got us cabs, gave us directions, helped us with our luggage when we needed it and greeted us with a smile whenever we came or went.  Truly this was the best hotel experience I have ever had.",5,2016,04,26
206,Constructive feedback - not to be taken personally!,"Conversation while checking out

Guest services: How was your stay?
Me: Alright
GS: What, not 'very good'? Why?? 
[Looks about to cry]
Me: [Complains about the parking]
GS: So other than that, were there any problems? [Puppy eyes, looks about to burst in tears if I didn't say no]
Me: No.

Overall this was an okay stay, probably a 3.5 though I've rounded it up to a 4 on account of the room service guy who runs an awesome one man show, taking, delivering and bussing orders very promptly.

Here are the issues that I couldn't tell the guest services person about given how personally she was taking it:

1) The arrival experience was bad. We preferred not to use valet parking as we were leaving stuff in the car which the hotel would not have wanted responsibility for. However, the parking was terrible. The spots are drawn for compact cars only. Most cars couldn't fit in the spaces and so took up more than one spot each, so it filled up early in the day. After parking, the way to get up to the hotel wasn't clearly marked. There are 2 elevators but neither of them work. Had to take the stairs with our luggage and haul ourselves around the block to get to the hotel entrance.

2) No power sockets at bedside. As a hotel that positions itself as a luxury modern hotel, this is a huge miss. All the nice hotels I've stayed at in the past few months have had charging stations built into the bedside furniture. It was super annoying to have to walk all the way across the room to access my charging gadgets.

3) The room had an accessible bathroom. I've stayed at many hotels but this is the first time I've been given such a room. Regular facilities should have been provided alongside the accessible facilities. Unfortunately, there was no shower stall in the bathroom for accessibility reasons; showering was a very chilly experience. There was nowhere to hang a towel for easy reach to bundle up after aforementioned chilly shower. There was also no hairdryer. If there was one elsewhere in the room, there was no sign and I don't have time to go hunting. And finally, there was very little space around the sink to put toiletries.

4) View was lousy at the back of the building. Really hate getting bad views at hotels.

5) The hotel benefits from proximity to some officers, but there are few dining options in the immediate vicinity. As a result (and also due to the inconvenience of the parking situation), we ate in both nights, once at the restaurant and once room service. The hotel food was good for 2 nights, but there is not enough variety for a longer stay.",4,2016,04,26
206,Fab hotel,The marker hotel is a fabulous hotel. Everything from the staff to the bar to the rooms was fabulous. The rooftop bar is amazing. Food was fab too. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Expensive but you get what you pay for!,5,2016,04,26
206,First class.,Fantastic hotel. Marvellous staff. Beautiful location and setting. Arguably the finest hotel in Dublin. Modern yet entirely comfortable and beautiful. The pool is not to be missed and together with the roof terrace are two gems of Dublin.,5,2016,04,26
206,Modern Hotel in a great location!,This was a wonderful surprise when we checked into this modern & beautiful hotel in Dublin. Located in the center of an office district with lots of great restaurants in the neighborhood. One block away from the river and only a 20 minute walk to the downtown area of Dublin. A real find!,5,2016,04,25
206,5*luxury cruise on the grand canal,"This was our first family stay in the Marker,We enjoyed the stay with one 4 years,2years old boys and 8 months old twin boy/girl.It was well deserved break from the last 4 years as the pregnancys and the breastfeeding keep me busy in the past.Big thank you to Fiona O'Brien from reservation who was suporting us from the begining and made our stay memorable.We got two conected large rooms what the kids enjoyed a lot.Staff from the bfast shop was very friendly and our server Sabina was very kind.The boys from Concierge very kind and pleasant.In room dining had nice service and food as well.I will highly recomend this hotel for everybody who is looking to spend nice weekend in the city.Elizabeth",5,2016,04,25
206,Modern hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights whilst visiting Dublin. Beautiful hotel in and very up and coming area. 

We originally booked a king deluxe suite and upon arrival got asked if we wanted to upgrade to a corner suite with panoramic views of the city. Be careful as we found ourself with 2 extra windows in our room, both looking out onto another building across the street and the 3rd window looked out towards the dock (if you looked at an angle). Plus we were on the 1st floor, so not as panoramic as we were hoping. We were told that the deluxe corner suite was the the room that got the views so got refunded 60 euros after we complained.

Breakfast was good with a good selection of food.

Overall, a good hotel, just be careful what room you chose. We had room 115.",4,2016,04,25
206,Great service and food,"I searched a number of hotels in Dublin for my mothers 70th birthday and we decided on the Marker as I listen to the Sean Moncrief show and the chef sounded good when being interviewed.

We were blown away even before we set foot in the place by the excellent customer service from Deirdre Dwyer who despite my many queries and changes was superb in dealing with them. She made sure that it was a special treat for my mother and had a cake with happy birthday in the room.

The room(corner suite) was perfect for them and extremely comfortable. I brought my nephew to the pool and it was very surprising as I wasn't expecting much. We then went to the bar area in the lobby and I asked for ice cream which wasn't on the menu but the manager dealt with me perfectly and brought it out which made my nephew very happy.

We had dinner in the Hotel restaurant that night and the food was amazing! I had the risotto and rib eye which were both extremely tasty. Our waitress(Maria) continued the excellent service we had become accustomed to in the Marker and looked after all our needs. She also arranged for us to go up and see the rooftop bar despite it being closed. The gentleman man who was up there gave us a great description of the viewpoints around Dublin and obliged us with a family photo. 

All in all it was perfect, great service, food and location. ",5,2016,04,25
206,Great location and great service,"My last stay in Dublin was dating a bit.. close to 20 years! So my stay at The Marker hotel was an unexpected experience. the hotel is located in a totally renewed part of Dublin, close to the docks, and still close to city center (10mns cab drive). The hotel staff is very welcoming ; the rooms are large and comfortable with all amenities one needs . Overall a great experience!",5,2016,04,25
206,Pool and service are top notch!,"Fabulous hotel! Well worth the high price! The pool is tremendously elegant and also includes a sauna steam room and jacuzzi. If you are a service guru, you will love the Marker. Sandra at front desk is very welcoming! Derek at the rooftop bar is a prime example of an Irish gentlemen!",5,2016,04,25
206,Beautiful hotel,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff, exceptional service and all round fantastic experience. I stayed in the hotel for work and it made life very easy. The rooms are great and the food very good, the location is fantastic if visiting the exhibition centre",5,2016,04,24
206,One night stay and spa treatment,"Beautiful/modern hotel, courteous/professional/accommodating staff. Amazing spa experience. Would absolutely recommend. Rooftop bar is a great place to have a beverage and unwind while enjoying beautiful views. Self-parking is a little tricky, I suggest the valet option",5,2016,04,22
206,"Fantastic Hotel, good value for money","nothing to complain about, would go again anytime. location is quite alright and everything in walking distance. Staff was very nice and forthcoming. Very clean and also great room service. Unfortunately the rooftop bar was closed due to the wheater. I guess I got to check it out next time. :-)",5,2016,04,22
206,5* Service at Modern Hotel,"This waa a business stay and the hotel is very chic. The checkin and checkout service was smooth. Fantastic hotel which I will be returning to for pleasure purposes. The breakfast option was slightly limited, we really like choice  but to be honest the service was great fantastic staff and lovely Spa area that i want to return soon.",5,2016,04,21
206,Fab place to stay ...has it all,"My absolute favourite hotel in Dublin. ..Fantastic value for 5 star hotel. Rooms amazing , food great with loads of healthy options. LOVE the cocktails! The staff are lovely & very professional. The spa is gorgeous. ",5,2016,04,21
206,Great stay,"Great hotel, very nice and modern, lovely rooms.  Staff was very informative, courteous, and helpful. They even bring you fresh milk and butter to the room!  Great rooftop too with a phenomenal view of the city, ",5,2016,04,21
206,More business than leisure,"Nice room and clean, good sleeping bed!
Responsif staff in general.
But first ever hotel that charges you for parking (27Euro wich you descover at the end)!!
With room rates from simple to double from one day to another!?!",3,2016,04,21
206,Hen Weekend üòäüôÉüêì,"Stayed here with my friend for the weekend of my hen! Beautiful hotel- really modern and in a great location for town! Our room was lovely and the beds were so comfy. 
The spa is great and the pool is lovely and relaxing (and also darkly lit)! I hopefully will be back ;) ",5,2016,04,21
206,Bollinger Evening with Tasting menu,"This was the most fantastic evening and I couldn't recommend it enough! If the hotel hosts another event like this I will definitely be going! 
The evening began with a champagne reception and canapes on the rooftop terrace. It was a beautiful evening which helped but it is absolutely worth having a drink there whether you're a guest in the hotel or just on a night out.
Then we were seated in the restaurant downstairs for the most fabulous tasting menu. the Chef (Gareth) came out to introduce the courses and share his inspiration for how he put the dishes together to pair with each champagne being served. 
I can honestly say it was one of the most delicious meals i have had in a very long time. I won't go into all the courses but the tuna carpacio and the turbot were amazing. 
The service we received from all staff was exceptionally high and I would highly recommend anyone to stay in this beautiful hotel on any occasion whether its for a special night out, a girly catch up or a more corporate function. 
Personally I can't wait for the next event!!",5,2016,04,20
206,Beautiful Hotel in the heart of the docklands,"It's ultra modern, and if you like that then you will love The Marker.   I adore the location, overlooking the Grand Canal dock area, a buzzy business area with lots of cafes, restaurants nearby.   I just wish I had had a room overlooking the water, but I was only there for one night so it wasn't that important.   Next time (and there will be one) I will be asking for that.
The Bord Gais Energy Theatre (itself a very impressive building) is right next door.   The hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff are welcoming, friendly, professional.   Liked that I was escorted to the lift when I checked in by Peter.
My room had EVERYTHING you could need for a comfortable stay and I think the best coffee making corner I have ever seen.   You name it, the room has it.  The bathroom was just that - had a bath and a large and powerful separate shower.   Closet space a little limited especially if two are sharing the room, but it was enough for me - the singleton.

Nearest LUAS stop is a 10 minute leisurely stroll from the hotel, you could probably get there faster if you broke into a jog, and this is probably the only downside for me.   I really dislike using taxis, so I like to be quite near the LUAS or a Bus stop.   This hotel is about as far from the stop as I would care to be.   It would be a most unpleasant walk on a wet day.   However, the walk (across the Samuel Beckett bridge) is very interesting and pleasant.   I imagine that most guests at The Marker will either walk to their destination or take a taxi  (taxi rank outside the door)

I had breakfast there (not necessarily included in the room price) and it was excellent.

This hotel is not cheap, but for  special occasion it ticks all the boxes.",5,2016,04,19
206,A 5 Star Experience!,"I had the pleasure of staying in The Marker for a work event.. I left the hotel feeling like I had been away on a break! It was a fantastic experience, they manage to offer 5 star service, in a very relaxed, informal and down to earth way. All the staff I encountered were friendly and helpful, and so genuine. For anyone what is conscious of healthy eating, they are all over this! and have a menu that caters to this, with raw juices included. But also plenty of treats too - with chips and other good stuff. If you are looking to enjoy Dublin, be it from Ireland or not, and feel like you are getting a proper treat then this is definitely a hotel worth checking out. You will not be disappointed.",5,2016,04,18
206,Excellent service!,"We spent 3 nights here. The staff and service was excellent! Very knowledgeable about things to do in Dublin.  Great accommodations! We loved the lobby bar as well as the rooftop bar. Both had great drink, food and service. We will definitely stay here again!",5,2016,04,17
206,Top service,I always book this hotel when staying in Dublin. I have stayed multiple times for both business and leisure since they opened. The standard is always superb on each visit. Rooms are spacious and luxurious. The food is fantastic and all staff are extremely attentive and helpful. Having stayed here many times I've availed of all services from the roof top bar to the spa and I must say I absolutely couldn't fault a thing. I honestly wouldn't stay in any other hotel in Dublin as I find it difficult to find a hotel that is consistent with standards. Looking forward to another visit soon.,5,2016,04,16
206,Excellent ,"Brilliant stay at the marker,  the hotel is bright and modern,  the room was lovely,  the breakfast great and the staff are all so friendly and efficient. Will definitely stay here again and would highly recommend.  ",5,2016,04,16
206,5 star all round,"Stayed here for two nights on business. Made very welcome by Cristina.

Room 315 was so luxurious. Fantastic view of canal and lovely bathroom.

Good selection for breakfast. Was very happy overall.

Had a spa treatment by Yvette. Was very relaxing. A pedicure for 60 euros which lasted an hour. 

The staff in The Marker are all very pleasant. There were two staff who really made my stay very nice. Nazim in Room Service. What a gentleman..a true ambassador for our industry. 
Fionnula who served my food in the bar. Again went out of her way to make me feel welcome.
If I am in Dublin again I would love to return to The Marker.
",5,2016,04,15
206,Anniversary Stay,"What a fantastic hotel. Not cheap but worth the extra money. Fantastic room with all the amenities you need. Huge bathroom with separate walk in shower. On learning it was our Anniversary the receptionist sent us a lovely bottle of red wine up to the room. We didn't eat at the hotel or use the spar but definitely 5*. 
Will be going back soon.",5,2016,04,15
206,Stylish hotel,"We had a lovely weekend stay at the Marker with the family, the rooms are clean and bright and the beds were very comfortable!
The staff were pleasant and nothing was too much trouble, the pool was nice (think they need to review the restrictions for pool use for older children!) the breakfast was lovely and we really couldn't find fault with this hotel and would definitely recommend it , a special mention for the doorman/concierge who went out of his way to advise and help us with the places to visit/transport options etc thanks! ",5,2016,04,15
206,Great hotel,"Stayed at marker for 3 nights on business trip having stayed at several other hotels in town I find this one to be the best combination of space, style, comfort, location and atmosphere.

The Spa is excellent. The staff very professional. There is very little to criticise.",5,2016,04,14
206,An Awesome Place,"We just returned from 6 nights at The Marker and I can't say enough good things  about the hotel. At check in we were upgraded to a nice sized room on the 5th floor with a view of the plaza and the cool red and green colored sculpture garden. We had a huge marble bathroom and our room was very quiet, like we were the only people there,although I know the hotel was completely booked.The staff is excellent, very friendly and helpful. I found the front desk people to be a little cold and robotic, but the door man and bar and restaurant people are great. 
The hotel is modern and well designed,in a good location at The Docklands, a newer area full of younger people (Google etc is there), very safe - quiet and  removed  yet only a 15 minute walk to the City Center, Temple Bar, Grafton Street, Trinity College, the museums, etc. 
When we made the reservation a while back we wanted 6 nights but they said they could only do 5 as they were booked, but once we were there and liked it so much, we made it clear we wanted that 6th night and they made it happen, so we really appreciated that effort on their part.
We would definitely come back and plan to do so soon. 
Pros: 
We went to the bar every evening for a pre-dinner drink and were treated like family from the first night.The drinks are good and the bar food is excellent.
Breakfast is very good. not a lot of choices, but the best buffet breakfast I've had at any European hotel.
Beautiful hotel - looks like a Four Seasons inside
Taxis always available, easy walk, very safe area.
Perfect for those seeking high end accommodations in the city yet with a chic, modern feel.
Special thanks to:Yair, Godfrey, Petya, Dev for excellent service, professional attitude and friendly way, we left feeling we made new friends and will miss them.
Cons:
The bathroom shower has a very bad design, water goes everywhere.
Our room was very hot and there was no way to adjust the temp.
Over all this is a good choice in Dublin,",5,2016,04,14
206,First Class - 5*,"My mum and I stayed at the Marker for a long weekend in Dublin and from the moment we stepped out of a cab in the pouring rain we had one of the doormen running over with a brolly to help us with our luggage! We were lucky enough to check in early as there was an adapted room free earlier than the usual which was great. The room itself was huge as was the bathroom and both were absolutely spotless. I would say the thing that makes this hotel special is the staff as they were all incredibly helpful, cheerful and couldn't do enough for their guests. Although location isn't as central as some other hotels it is only a 20 walk to the shops and attractions and benefits from being slightly less crazy/noisy then central Dublin! I will be recommending this hotel so all my friends and family next time they visit the city and would jump at the chance to stay again myself!",5,2016,04,13
206,Perfect In Every Way,"From the moment we arrived The Marker truly delivered. We were met by an extremely professional and friendly doorman in a top hat and trench coat. He immediately welcomed us and escorted us to the door while asking about our trip. Meanwhile others were gathering up our luggage and bringing it in. The reception desk was also amazing. All the women at the desk were full of smiles, fast and efficient. The lobby is very modern and spacious. We then were taken to our room by the bellman. Our room was very spacious with a great view of the Grand Canal. The bathroom was huge with a tub and separate shower. A real nice feature is the heated floor in the bathroom. The bed was very comfortable. The room decor was very tastefully done. To us a big plus was the location. Located in the Docklands it is a little ways, but not far from the city center. The good side is it is away from the chaos of a very busy city. It may be the quietest hotel stay in a major city that we ever had. We are extremely happy  with every aspect of our stay. Now we just need to find time to come back for another stay.",5,2016,04,11
206,High Value Beautiful Hotel,"Even though it's pretty pricey it's 100% worth it, you get tremendous value and it really is a super awesome & stylish hotel, loved it!  Would definitely stay again, next time not on business so I could enjoy more of what it had to offer!",5,2016,04,11
206,First class service,"First class service from the incredibly friendly and helpful staff gave our weekend trip to Dublin a touch of magic.

The hotel was immaculately clean and comfortable ! We were upgraded to a deluxe room on arrival which was a nice surprise. 

Wonderful hotel and staff!

206,"Good hotel, little details can be improved","Hotel looks very new. And of course very clean. Huge room and toilet, with tub and separete shower. Big desk. Floot to ceiling windows. Toilet has heating under the floor which I think is really a good detail.
Really friendly and helpful staff.
Room cleaning staff really put attention to details.
The spa is awesome.
Free wifi.

But...
The breakfast selection is a bit limited, especially the pastries.
The air conditioned keeps doing noise even if you turn it off. 
The alarm in the ceiling does a clicking sound every minute (maybe it was defective) but it ends up being annoying.
But the worst thing is the door slamming. Rooms have such a big and heavy door that when one is closed nearby, my whole room would vibrate, even the windows.This seems to be a problem in almost every hotel I have been. why nobody uses a better system?

I give 5 stars because the overall experience was very good and I would come back to this hotel again.",5,2016,04,09
206,Excellent Hotel,"We spent our first two nights in Ireland at the Marker Hotel. We arrived into Dublin around 6:30 AM and got to the hotel around 7:15AM. Even though the hotel was full the night before, they managed to get us into our room about 9:45 AM. The room was very nice, especially the bathroom. It has a very large shower and a heated e staff was very friendly and accommodating. ",5,2016,04,09
206,Lived up to expectations,"I had heard very positive things about this hotel and so when I saw a reasonable rate appear on my company travel web site, I booked it for two nights.  I thought the location, while a little away from the centre of the town, would be a good base to get taxis from, and that was right, although the layout of the bridges in the area, don't give taxis many choices if you are coming from the north.  I arrived and was instantly impressed with the sense of luxury and the attentiveness of the staff.  I was given a large room on the 5th floor, facing the river and overlooking an interesting old chimney stack.  The room had two double beds and looked very modern and clean.  The bathroom was all marble with a heated floor (although it was deemed to be summer, so it didn't function).  Apart from that, everything worked.  You get lovely toiletries, robes and slippers.  There is very good free coffee in the lobby in the morning and the room has coffee making facilities.  The bar area is nice too, not buzzing like the Shelbourne, more relaxed and an excellent choice of drinks.  There is a roof top bar, but it wasn't deemed summer enough for this to be open yet, so I guess I need to come back when it is warmer.  There are a few restaurants in the area too.  I had some high expectations, which can sometimes leave you a little disappointed, but I was very happy with my stay.",5,2016,04,09
206,Great Hotel,"Perfect location, modern feel, clean with plenty of extra amenities and both the food and staff were great.
After checking in I visited the spa for a treat after the journey. It was quiet and relaxing and I enjoyed the steam room, sauna, jacuzzi and pool.
I had a lovely corner suite on the fifth floor with a view of the docks.
I will be returning to Dublin to show it off to friends and family and will of course book is into the Marker when I travel with them.",5,2016,04,08
206,Fabulous 5 star hotel,"I have just written a thank you note to the Marker Hotel. How often do we do that? But they went out of their way to make our weekend fabulous. We were upgraded to a suite after I wrote telling them it was a special weekend. They did more too with other touches such as a welcome card, rose petals etc. But even if we hadn't experienced this I would have liked it there. For one thing its so modern, so chic with a fabulous open foyer and cool rooftop bar. The furniture is designer cool. The modern art well chosen and eclectic. The pool and spa area was lovely. The architecture of the hotel interesting with odd angles and sloping ceilings. Lots of light but great use of dark walls and floors in places. But the highlight of the visit was the really lovely staff who were just so welcoming and well trained in service. A pleasure. Finally the location is great. Its in what I'd consider a 'new' quarter of Dublin but has a lively feel to it, beside the Grand Canal Theatre and near to Google, Facebook HQs etc. You can walk into city centre easily, So no shortage of things to do and see.",5,2016,04,05
206,Totally enjoyed it immensely,"From the moment we arrived at The Marker Hotel, the experience was absolutely what you would expect from a five star Hotel. The building is absolutely an architectural gem in the heart of the docklands development and the interior certainly does not fail to impress. The modern and impressive lobby, bar and restaurant are so beautiful and lives up to five star expectations. 
The check in experience was first class and the staff were very helpful and friendly. I was absolutely delighted when I was informed that the hotel upgraded us to a larger room with a view of the canal and separate shower and bath free off charge. The room was immaculate with all the amenities that you would expect for this standard of hotel. The decor was in keeping with the overall design of the rest of the hotel. The bed and linen were so comfortable. The minibar was well stocked with tempting treats but in my opinion a little bit overpriced.  The WiFi was fast, reliable and convenient,  and the personal touches like a onscreen welcome message on our room TV was lovely. Unfortunately we didn't have time to avail of the leisure facilities and experiencing the cuisine in the Brasserie and cocktails at the Rooftop Bar, but we are looking forward to do so upon our next stay. 
The overall experience was absolutely amazing and enjoyable during 
our stay at The Marker Hotel. But I  do think that it wouldn't have been as remarkable without the friendly staff. Yes the building, interior and food was  exquisite and worth the five star rating but without the staff within the Hotel from the  door man to the reception, bar and restaurant staff and even the housekeeping staff were so helpful and friendly. you could seine that they took great pride in their jobs and most importantly in providing the exceptional service that is expected at a five star hotel. The staff for us made our stay at the Marker hotel, and without this I don't think the five star amenities wouldn't have been enough to make our stay truly remarkable and enjoyable 
I would recommend the Marker hotel but I do have to say that the location is a little far the city centre but the public transportation are within walking distance from the marker hotel to all the hot spots of Dublin.",5,2016,04,04
206,Stunning hotel and free birthday upgrade!,"We stayed here a a few weeks back for my birthday after being recommended by a colleague. From the moment you literally pull round the corner it's special treatment! I was fumbling for change for taxi when the door opened and someone offers my hand - not used to that sort of service from a hotel! He lad was lovely (Richard I think) he was a true Dub and asked what we'd be doing etc, was very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is stunning and very modern and light and airy, the carpets near the rooms are amazingly soft and bouncy too! Unbeknownst to me the hotel and asked my boyfriend if we were there for a special occasion and he said it my birthday, so we had an upgrade to an amazing (and huge) corner room that looked out onto the gaiety theatre , comfiest bed I've ever slept in I a hotel and the finishing touches were lovely, as was the fancy bathroom (amazing shower). They'd also put a lovely cake in our room with a birthday message on it! The breakfast was lovely with a good choice and people seemed to be asking for various things that the staff would get them, as though nothing was a problem. I had a massage which was a lovely experience- the lady even advised me on a bit of a muscle/back problem I didn't really realise I had, which I'm very grateful for and I've notice a difference since taking her advice. The little chill out room after is a really nice treat with the sorbet and orange juice! The pool and jacuzzi are great too. We didn't have any cocktails unfortunately but that will be for next time! I think you basically get what you pay for and this really is worth paying more for!",5,2016,04,01
206,Best Hotel in Dublin!,"We have just returned from our third stay at the Marker. The hotel itself is impeccable, the staff are extremely welcoming and the spa is superb. The hotel is very modern and cosmopolitan with wonderful views over the canal and square. It does not have that traditional or ‚Äòstuffy‚Äô feel to it that some Dublin hotels possess. Unnikrishnan Ramachandran personally greeted us upon arrival and ensured our stay was perfect. We believe this is truly an outstanding hotel and the best hotel in Dublin. Looking forward to a return for the fourth time when the rooftop bar is open for business.",5,2016,03,31
206,Gorgeous Hotel with Amazing Staff,"Recently visited The Marker as part of my partners Christmas gift. We were booked on the Easter Indulgence Package which turned out to be amazing value. We were greeted at 10.30am and we asked to leave our bags whilst we explored Dublin pre check in. To our delight our room was ready and we were ascorted upstairs. What a great start. We were also offered late check out which was a lovely treat. The rooms are amazing - decked out in a modern, chic and lux style with amazing marble bathrooms. 
We made use of the spa which was clean and relaxing with a small indoor swimming pool, steam room and sauna. I enjoyed a 60 minute facial which was amazing and was completed with lemon sorbet and pinapple juice at the end! 
Breakfast was gorgeous - buffet style but was so fresh and tidy as well as having staff clearing away promptly left us feeling relaxed yet our stomachs fully lined for the day! Lots of choice and gorgeous food. 
All in all an amazing hotel, the staff can't do enough for you. If you want luxury in Dublin this is the place to go. Area is modern and upcoming.",5,2016,03,31
206,Perfection!,"I travel a lot on business and the stay at The Marker was one of my best experiences. The hotel is located in a lovely peaceful area, close to water, surrounded by very nice modern architecture. My room was on the 5th floor. I was impressed by the generous size of both - the room and the bathroom (bathtub and a walk-in shower, heated floor). The design is modern and clean, the room was full of light. The attention to detail is abnormal; everything is focused on your comfort.
The staff is incredibly friendly and personal, yet professional. Kasia at the reception was lovely, as well as Nico and the gentlemen from room service.
The restaurant is excellent. The Marker has a lovely spa. I did not have time to test it, but I am planning to come back. So next time.",5,2016,03,31
206,Stylish Modern Hotel,"Here is a modern style hotel that manages to combine modern with style and comfort and not just an excuse to be eclectic. It takes a formulaic pattern and manages to create a real 5 star environment and make it a real pleasure to stay.
Room and bathroom was well appointed. Food is good; staff are pleasant and efficient. Spa was excellent with a real swimming pool. Gym adequate. 
Website does not do the hotel justice.
Will definitely return - in the summer though to enjoy the roof top bar.",5,2016,03,31
206,Amazing stay at the Marker hotel,"Just returned to London after a weekend in Dublin. Stayed in the Marker on Sunday night to attend at gig. Started off by having a treatment in the Spa. had a back massage and facial. it was really lovely and the products they use are amazing. The Spa area is lovely got to use the Steam room, Sauna, jacuzzi and pool. Changing areas are really clean and the relaxation area is beautiful.
The rooms at the marker are amazing. we got upgraded to a Deluxe room. we had room service and the food  was excellent! 
Breakfast the next morning was also really good. i asked for another fresh coffee and the lady was very obliging. would not hesitate to stay here again. in fact the next time i come to Dublin i will definitely stay here. its a great spot!",5,2016,03,30
206,Beautiful minimalist room,I really like this hotel. It s a W hotel style but with class. Rooms are spacious. Clean. Modern. Bathroom are top. I couldnt use the spa as it closes at 9pm so when you come from business and want to relax after work it s a bit tricky. The location is nice and quiet. Finally despite putting 5 stars for the quality of the hotel my only negative point will be for the breakfast which doesnt match my overall expectation if you want a continental one. They could do much better and my colleagues expressed same feeling. ,5,2016,03,30
206,Brilliant Experience,"Lovely walks, lovely views, beautiful  Food. Staff  very friendly,this was a great experience and will visit again.Shop and Pharmacy all with in 100 metres from Hotel,lovely coffee shops even closer if your a people watcher this is your heaven",5,2016,03,29
206,Truly a Treat,This was the first time my family stayed in this hotel and certainly will not be the last. We had a wonderful experience it was truly a treat for myself my husband and three children. We all enjoyed the stay immensely it was luxury. Thank you for making our Easter Weekend Fabulous.,5,2016,03,29
206,Great stay,Really nice hotel with great service from check in to check out. The room was very large and spotless. Comfy bed with nice pillows. Both breakfast and dinner was lovely.  I didnt get to use the spa area. ,5,2016,03,27
206,Break,"Stayed for a night after my partner arrived on a flight from Australia. 
The hotel is modern clean and very chic
Staff are of course very helpful and courteous 
Roof top bar is a cool addition 
Rooms are large and comfy
Pool area is sleek and relaxing 
Overall good stay for a night in the city 
For the price I would probably prefer to stay in a more rural luxury hotel and something a bit more cheap ask cheerful for a city stay but that just depends on your budget and what your requirements are.
For what this hotel is it is an excellent hotel with lovely staff ",4,2016,03,27
206,Second stay - would reckmmend,"I stayed at the Marker for 3 nights having stayed here before on a weekend break. The hotel is fantastic - the staff are very friendly, keen to have a chat and always go out of their way to help out. The decor and rooms are lovely - very clean and pristine. The bathroom was big and very comfortable, featuring underfloor heating, a large supply of towels and a bath as well as shower. The Marker has the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in; there is complimentary wifi in the room, as well as a great big window, blackout blinds, mini bar and all other standard amenities such as iron, hair dryer and safe. I used the spa which was lovely - it features a swimming pool, a large jacuzzi as well as sauna and steam room. I had breakfast on two mornings and it was just fantastic. The Marker has that luxurious edge that a lot of hotels lack and it is the detail that makes it so special. I will definitely stay here again on my return to Dublin!",5,2016,03,24
206,Fantastic service,This hotel is a great base for a couple of nights in Dublin. The vibe is cool and stylish. The bar is always busy with a friendly atmosphere. The staff are exceptional and nothing is too much trouble. Large spacious rooms and super comfy beds with great views over the square. The Spa is also a great bonus .,5,2016,03,23
206,Top Class hotel with a very friendly crew.,"The rooms are spacious and clean, excellent beds and a choice of pillows.
Room service fast as you can get it.
The team of concierges know their way around ( not only the usual restaurants around the block, but also the "" off the beaten track"" pubs ), which makes a change.
A special word for the front-office managers, who managed to deal with a couple of reservations problems in a very professional and satisfactory manner. Real top class!
( those who I am referring to will know who they are )
My apologies for finding out to late that this was a non smoking hotel ( as apparently all hotels in Ireland are ) also delt with by the staff in a polite manner.
One minor remark: the lighting in the corridors is in my opinion a bit to low.
Apart from that: a great hotel with excellent staff and good value for money",5,2016,03,23
206,Did not meet expectations.,"I stayed here on the Saturday night for the Ireland V Scotland match at the Aviva. We arrived at 2.50pm and check in was supposed to be at 3pm, our room was not ready and we went to the bar for a drink while we waited (this was my suggestion and they were not complementary). We were given a terrible seat behind a large sign and couldn‚Äôt see anything. We were told they would come and tell us when our room was ready. We were still waiting by 3.40pm so we went back up to reception; our room was finally ready after a few more minutes of waiting. The match was at 5pm so we were looking to get into our room sooner rather than later. The room was lovely, the d√©cor was nice and bright and it was superbly clean. The bathroom was stocked well with products and the shower was effortless. There was a good view of the Bord Gais Theatre and the canal. The walk to the Aviva was quick and there were always taxis outside the hotel if you needed them. When we got back to the hotel after the match we booked a table for 8pm to get some dinner. The bar menu was lovely, the food was of a really good standard, it was pricey but you come to expect that when you are staying in a five star hotel, it was worth it. It did take a long time for the food to come and that was a little disappointing. Food was ordered to come to the room in the morning and it came we everything we had asked for, I couldn‚Äôt fault that. We checked out a little later than we should have but it didn‚Äôt seem to be an issue. The Valet service was great. The reception staff were not overly friendly during checkout; I found them overall to not be very friendly. The other members of staff were so obliging, I couldn‚Äôt fault them. I don‚Äôt think I would stay here again, I found the place slightly pretentious compared to other places that I have stayed.",3,2016,03,23
206,Great hotel,"We had a great overnight stay at The Marker. The hotel is quite smart and trendy with large rooms, comfortable bed and a huge powerful shower stocked with fab bath products by hotel standards. We ate at the Brasserie before heading out for a gig and the food was a good standard albeit quite expensive. 

We made use of the lush pool area on our second day. My only bug bear was that there was only one hairdryer available in the ladies changing room... you need a good couple more!

Grand Canal Square is a smart, quiet area but there's not much to do in the immediate vicinity. The Three Arena is just a 15-20 minute walk in one direction and Temple Bar the same again but in the other direction. 

I'd definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again if I went back to Dublin.",4,2016,03,23
206,A great location for everything . . . .,Stayed for two nights and found it to be an excellent place to stay. The staff were really helpful and the rooms were modern and spacious. The hotel is in an excellent location for exploring the city.,5,2016,03,21
206,Excellent location & staff,"We stayed here three nights at the start of a driving trip throughout the southern part of Ireland. It's a very modern hotel, well situated far enough away from the Temple Bar craziness, but an easy walk to the fun parts. The rooftop bar has a great view, although the staff the evening we visited were a bit overworked.",4,2016,03,21
206,Business district ,I was on business and the place I needed to go was close that was great. So for my convince not really for my pleasure this hotel suited my purposes. I have no complaints. The rooms were clean and nice and reception was professional. However if I was in Dublin as a tourist or visiting I would not stay in this location. I'd be happy to get a lesser hotel for more of the fantastic day and night life Dublin has to offer. ,3,2016,03,20
206,Great hotel and Excellent service,"Much better hotel than I expected arriving to a business meeting and with no knowledge about the hotel. Great rooms, great lobby bar, excellent staff. Even the fish soup in the bar had gourmet qualities!! Lovey bed in a quiet room. The only negative I could find was the scrambled eggs for breakfast (too much water). All in all, a great price performance!!",5,2016,03,20
206,Simply the best,"The hotel gets everything right. The amenities and design are top notch. The hotel staff across the board were friendly and helpful, and made sure that everything was taken care to the highest degree. The best hotel experience I've had in a long time.",5,2016,03,19
206,Super nice hotel in a surprising location,"Having lived in Dublin 10+ years ago the location of the hotel was a big surprise to me. What was a no go area is completely regenerated and shiny and new. We chose it as we had business in the area, otherwise would have stayed more in the centre. 
From the moment we arrived at the hotel the service was faultless, the staff go out of their way to help and accommodate. The rooms are relatively spacious and stylish with a beautiful marble bathroom. We had drinks and food in the bar a few evenings which was lovely, but to be honest I think we were just too lazy to venture out in bad weather cos the hotel is a bit far away from the city centre, Stephens green, temple bar etc. While this was ok for us it might be a bit annoying for tourists or visitors that want to be centrally located. 
Breakfast was fab, great selection and outstanding quality and service. The spa was also lovely if a bit small for a hotel this size. 
Overall we loved this place and would stay again but perhaps hope for better weather so we can go out and about in the evenings.",4,2016,03,16
206,One of the Best in Dublin,"I have now stayed at the Marker twice, both times for business.  I am typically in Dublin a few times a year, and stay at a couple of different hotels depending on where I have meetings.  If I need to be at the Convention Centre or anywhere near it, the Marker is my choice.  The rooms are spacious and quiet, with comfortable beds, nice bathrooms and (if you're facing the front) good views over Grand Canal Dock.  

I have only had breakfast and drinks at the hotel, but the breakfast buffet (included, at least on my visits) is very high quality and has a great selection, and the lobby lounge is a pleasant place for a cocktail in the evening.  I have only visited in the winter so the rooftop bar has been closed.  I've only been to the fitness center once, since I generally prefer to go for a run outside along the river if the weather allows, but the gym is a good size and has state-of-the-art equipment--including some nifty treadmills with video simulating runs through some scenic spots around the world.

The front desk service is friendly and professional.  Overall I highly recommend the Marker.  The only potential downside is that it's a bit less central for sightseeing, but it's very well located for the CCD and the many businesses along the river.",5,2016,03,14
206,The Marker Hotel Dublin,"Excellent hotel, friendly staff, very clean, excellent pool, steam room and sauna.  no road noise, convenient to the 3 Arena.  Would definitely stay again.  Would like breakfast to be into the price though",4,2016,03,14
206,Excellent,"The hotel seems to be new and state of the art. The includes the rooms which are very well equipped and spacious (but you can't open any windown), the gym which has a goo selection of equipment as well as the reception and bar area. The location is quiet next to the channels but good walking distance to the convention center.",5,2016,03,13
206,Nice hotel but could get more for less,Expected more for the price. Executive suite was very stuffy as there were no windows> Rooftop was closed too which was one reason why we booked there in the first place. Residents bar was closed 3am.  However it is a great location and the staff were nice and friendly.,4,2016,03,13
206,Beautiful hotel,"Excellent location. The rooms were spacious with comfy beds and a lovely bathroom.  The customers services team went out of their way to make sure we had an amazing stay.  I had arranged some champagne, strawberries and cronuts to be in our room on arrival and some treatments in the spa.  Everything was perfect!  We didn't have any negatives at all....would certainly stay again.",5,2016,03,12
206,So Disappointed..,"My Partner and i stayed one night at The Marker hotel on a recent visit to Dublin to see the delightful show Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in the very near by Board Gais Theatre.Unfortunately we were not entirely happy with our stay at The Marker Hotel, Our check-in was at approx 2.30pm it was quick and efficient and we where told by the receptionist that the Brasserie restaurant was booked up and  finished at 5pm, the Roof Top Bar was not open but we could eat in the bar. We were then duly given our key card to the room, the price we paid for our one night stay was 299euro(inc vat) and then were told this did not include breakfast! we where disappointed by this,I feel when you pay this kind of money for a room surely it would include a breakfast?!?...The room its self was tastefully decorated and the bed was comfortable.The bathroom was probably the best aspect of the room with marble tiling through out  and under floor heating a large shower and a  double ended bath with nice toiletries,so i decided to have a bath while my partner had a drink at the bar.I had only got out of the bath and put a bath robe on when the door was knocked and opened at the same time!! thank god i had the time to put a bath robe on!! and there was a member of staff at the door asking if we had used the mini bar i told him NO that we had only checked in 40 mins before but he said he needed to check it anyway.So he came in and checked it and although he was very polite and apologized i  thought this was not acceptable... We went to the bar for a drink..nice cocktails but over priced at 13.20 euro a go. We decided not to eat in the bar as it was our ""only"" option on our visit in a 5 star hotel was the bar food..tut tut!! and we went else where..
Next morning we decided to have a lie-in as our breakfast was not included in the price of 299euro(inc vat) and our check out was not until 12 noon  and at 10.30am the door was being knocked by room service, tut tut again!! .Seriously do the staff and management/reception/room service team not liaise with each other to save the resident staying at a 5 star hotel the respect and privacy of their room until check out time and also same with the mini bar check ordeal the previous day..The expectations of a luxury product called The Marker Hotel did not deliver on our first visit and we where so disappointed .",3,2016,03,11
206,Really friendly modern hotel,"Stayed for 3 nights and really enjoyed the stay - highlights were very friendly staff, with nothing too much trouble and a sense that it came from the heart of the staff themselves, not as an imposed formula.  Room was modern spacious and well equipped

The harbour area has an open feel, but is pretty accessible to the main sites

So, Dublin is a great city to visit and whilst it has a great past, the present is pretty special too, so if you want a modern take on Dublin hospitality then choose the Market",4,2016,03,11
206,Fantastic....,"Amazing experience from beginning to end. Spotless rooms, spacious, lovely toiletries, great amenities, the spa was always quiet, clean and tranquil and the staff were welcoming, friendly and really went out of their way to make you feel special. The location was great for us as we didn't want to be in the thick of the city life but still only about a 20 minute stroll in town.  Even so the bar and restaurant were always busy so it didn't feel like you were in the middle of nowhere! Taxis are plentiful if you don't fancy the walk and there are plenty of pubs and restaurants within ten minutes. I would definitely stay again.",5,2016,03,09
206,"Conventially located, modern hotel",We choose to stay at the Marker Hotel due to it's convenient location close the 3 Arena which we were attending a concert  The hotel d√©cor is contemporary and modern with an ambience to complement  Our room was adequate with a large elegant bathroom  Convenience of pre-arranged valet parking was a nice add on  Disappointed that the roof top bar was closed during our stay. We were not notified of this until a few days prior to arrival by hotel personnel and by that stage we were out of alternative options to stay elsewhere  This hotel is a high end price hotel and we would've expected to be able to avail of all facilities during our stay but unfortunately this was not the case.  We may return again but will check in advance with the hotel before booking,4,2016,03,08
206,Flawless service,"Stayed in the marker with my sister after a day shopping in Dublin. From the moment we entered, the staff couldn't have been friendlier, In particular Paddy - he helped us with choosing cocktails (would really recommend the cucumber and elderflower) he also recommended things we could do in Dublin that night. We also had a great laugh with paddy the next morning at breakfast! Very pleasant, professional and has lovely personality. Will be back to see him again! He is an asset to your team, I have visited a lot of top class hotels and the service at the Marker is unrivaled! We will be back again very soon! ",5,2016,03,06
206,Beautiful Hotel,"Fantastic service by all the staff, very clean hotel and rooms are perfect, even the shampoo and shower gel are alot better than any other Hotel. However my only downside is the Dinner in the restaurant I feel it's definitely overpriced and wouldn't eat there again. However I would recommend the chocolate and peanut cake.
Top marks to all the staff, very professional!",3,2016,03,06
206,Really a good Irish Experience,Really quality service that will make you feel like you are at home. Brilliant spa and swiming pool. Good checkin and bookings can be done online really easily. Restaurant is balanced and you can also have a pint in the terrrace if the weather is good!!!,5,2016,03,06
206,Great hotel experience,"Nice and modern hotel, helpful staff, nice room and facilities, extremely clean. You get a good value for money. Good breakfast options, nice bar for the evening drinks Highly recommended if you stay in Dublin for business",5,2016,03,06
206,An excellent hotel for business in Dublin,"Stayed here for 5 days, good food, great room, very clean, nice indoor pool and decent gym, very helpful and friendly staff, one small complaint on my check in, my room not ready on time, but they made up for this by giving me a late check out at the end.",4,2016,03,02
206,Lovely Anniversary,"I took my wife to Dublin for our anniversary, The Marker is a top hotel, would definitely go back! Spa was great, room service, and food was great, the hotel restaurant was really nice, and we had sunshine on the roof top garden which was a surprise that time of the year.  It was the first time we had been to Ireland we loved it.",5,2016,03,01
206,Lovely LeDrunch,Service is top class and food was great. Little on the pricey side but only to be expected and totally justified given the beautiful interior and excellent service. It's the kind of place you come to for a a treat. Looking forward to coming back..,5,2016,03,01
206,Pippa's Fashion Factory Stay @Marker,"My friends and I stayed at the Marker hotel in Dublin when we were attending Pippa's Fashion factory. It was a really enjoyable stay, definitely will return. Everything was clean, modern and fabulous!! The hotel pool and spa area was lovely and the breakfast the next morning sorted out the sore heads. Overall excellent stay!!",5,2016,03,01
206,Amazing Hotel,We stayed in a superior room. It was a good size and the bathroom was amazing and featured a huge tub and underfloor heating. The view was disappointing and you could easily see into other people's room. Staff were friendly and helpful. Try the watermelon martini in the bar!,4,2016,02,29
206,Great stay,"Great hotel, fabulous spa and impeccable service. The bed was really comfortable and the hotel exuded peace and tranquillity and relaxation. Had a good restaurant recommendation of Osteria Lucio five minutes walk away. We didn't have the breakfast as a bit steep at 25 euro a time.",5,2016,02,29
206,Fab hotel,"The minute we arrive the staff were very helpful and friendly. We booked valet parking done very easy . Check in very quick. Bedroom was lovely and spacious and the bathroom had the wow factor. Love the toiletries brand. Bed comfortable. 
We used the swimming facilities. Very clean and everything was spot on. 
We book pre theatre meal and glad I allowed time for this as it does take a while. We booked at 5 and we finished at 7 which we headed across the way to Chitty Chitty bang bang. Location was perfect for this.
Food was lovely and catered well for gluten free diet.
Breakfast was one of the best especially for the likes of been a coeliac. Highly recommend. No queue and everything fresh and clean.
Forgot about the wonderful cocktails .
Check out was also speedy too.
I hope to return again if budget allows me ! ",5,2016,02,28
206,Excellent ,"I was here for just one night while on business in the city.

I arrived by taxi from the airport (‚Ç¨25). Check in was very good and the impression given nothing was too much trouble and I was made to feel very welcome

My standard room was of a good size, well set out and with high quality fittings. The bathroom was excellent with a nice large walk in shower. 

In the evening I had a few drinks in the bar where service was good.

I had a good night sleep and sound isolation was excellent.

Breakfast was very very good. Fresh and of good quality (but not cheap).

Location wise, this hotel is a good 20 minutes walk from the main tourist areas but great if you are here on business 

So an enjoyable but brief stay and I look forward to staying here again soon.",5,2016,02,28
206,Can't be faulted,"My girlfriend treated me to a weekend in Dublin for my birthday and she couldn't have chosen a better hotel. The Grand Canal makes for a wonderful backdrop with a real buzz about the place with the theatre, restaurants and cafes close by. Don't worry about the distance to the city centre: taxi, bus or walk (15 / 20 mins) will get you there in no time. Inside the hotel the two standout things were the watermelon martini my girlfriend had at the bar and the pool/spa area. Our room was very spacious along with the bathroom. We particularly liked the choice of music offered up in our room: Elvis, the Boss and Bon Jovi! If you are looking for a good base in which to take in everything Dublin has to offer but also want a little rest and relaxation then choose The Marker.",5,2016,02,27
206,Wow A+ hotel ,"Stayed at the hotel same time as I had a wine tasting venue.
The convention rooms are very nice and acoustic is excellent
Dinner and breakfast is super and done by some great chefs

Staff is extremely professional and friendly.

Rooms are one of the best I ever seen very well setup. Temperature at night was nice and cool shower separate from the bath and bed slept great.

Spa is also complimentary and very nice. Great pool sauna and Turkish sauna.
All in all not cheap but then again you get some serious hotel for it.
",5,2016,02,26
206,Hype,"The redeeming feature of the Marker was the pool and spa area. The rest of the hotel was average. The good stand outs was a knowledgeable bartender, the awesome shower gel and the car concierge service. Food was average for a seemingly 5 star hotel. At the price point the Marker commands I'd rate it 3/5",3,2016,02,25
206,Sumptuous,"The Marker is situated on the canal/river and from the minute you walk in you know it's special! Going to my 2nd floor room, the corridors are moody, lined with black wood and dimly lit. Makes for a very 'exclusive' experience. The only one time this was an issue was after being out for 2 hours in bright sunlight, it took a couple of minutes to readjust!
The rooms were beautiful, bed fantastically comfortable, bathroom with separate shower, massive powerful shower head, and the whole thing done in black marble. Very classy. Staff were lovely, helpful, breakfast really nice, and health spa impeccable. Pool temperature perfect, stream room hot! As it should be. All together 2 lovely nights.",5,2016,02,25
206,Remarkable,"The staff is so pleasant and professional, and the rooms are a true delight. Clean and stylish. Food is great, roomservice is great and drinks in the lobby are great. Nice view, and a superb area. Easy to get to and from airport. Would recommend staying here to anyone at any time.",5,2016,02,25
206,VERY SILENT NIGHT,The Bedrooms in this extraordinarily designed Hotel are exceptionally quiet and bedding most comfortable. The Capstan bath filler is not a favourite of mine but the Hansgrohe power shower made up for it. Their Restaurant and service are very good the Dishes are a little two large for the cutlery but otherwise their food & drinks menus are excellent with staff very friendly and attentive.,4,2016,02,23
206,Spa Day,"Myself and a friend had a spa day here. We both got the lava shell massage which was amazing! The spa is really nice, with jacuzzi, sauna steam room and swimming pool. Staff are so lovely and friendly. We had bar food after are treatments and the food is gorgeous and again staff are so friendly. Will definitely be looking into staying over night the  next time :) ",5,2016,02,23
206,Urban haven,"I have stayed here 3 times now & I love The Marker. The hotel is a very unique contemporary hotel on the exterior (depending on your opinion: could be ugly or amazingly creative). Its based on Grand Canal Dock a trendy area with tasty restaurants and cocktail bars for different budgets. Although its decor inside is v contemporary inside (which I wouldn't normally be a big fan of), it works well. The reception staff were incredibly helpful & check in was a breeze. Its a very new hotel (3 yrs old I believe) and is stunning - even when you walk down the corridors to you room, you feel like you could be in a James Bond movie. The Spa and Leisure centre are again stunning - luxurious but with character and incredibly unique. I used the Swimming Pool facilities& had a treatment done there and service was 5 star all the way. We ate once in the restaurant downstairs briefly and it was fresh and delicious. They serve the every popular 'Cronuts' there. We had breakfast in another area, and again the locally sourced & fresh buffet breakfast & continental breakfast was sublime. The rooms are funky yet cosy and super comfy. I personally loved the colour themes (which is not something I would usually comment/notice in a hotel). Our room faced the children play area of the hotel, and it was peaceful and relaxed.  It is hard to believe that you are in the city centre of Dublin and that's why I can only describe it as an Urban Haven. You are so close to everything around the city and can nip to your fav restaurant or pub/club in 5 minutes but once you are in the hotel, you are in an oasis of calm and luxury. I couldn't recommend it enough.",5,2016,02,22
206,Lovely experience,"We stayed here for a birthday treat the restaurant was beautiful and food was mouth watering, Professional and friendly staff, lovely spacious room, would defiantly recommend, very central and easy to get to",5,2016,02,22
206,A touch of class,Myself and my partner stayed at the Marker for 2 nights in mid-February and we thought it was a wonderful hotel.  It is difficult to highlight any particular aspect as it was all good. However I would mention that the staff were excellent - they must have good recruitment and training policies. We would definitely recommend. ,5,2016,02,22
206,February 19th 2016,"Our 1st visit to Dublin, lovely hotel, all staff very helpful and friendly, couldn't do enough for us. A wonderful stay in a lovely city. Arrived early and the room was already made up. Check in was seamless. The reception staff were happy to help with maps and mark city locations to suit our trip. The staff could not do enough to help and make our stay and enjoyable one.",5,2016,02,21
206,Fantastic Experience,"We went to Dublin for a weekend to include a play at the Bord Gais Theatre. The hotel was right beside the theatre. The staff are highly trained in customer service, very friendly, courteous and helpful in every way.",5,2016,02,21
206,Amazing!,We have just got back from a 2 night stay at the Marker Hotel and cannot recommend it enough. The staff are fantastic and the rooms and hotel is beautiful. Didn't have a chance to use the spa but looks wonderful. If you get a chance try the Ginger and Blueberry Collins! Can't thank them enough for making our stay and my birthday extra special. ,5,2016,02,21
206,The Marker Spa,"We only attended the Spa and did not stay in the hotel. 

The 1 hour massage was excellent. Professional masseuse in a lovely setting with minimal talk which is how I like it. After they bring you to a quiet area to sit and have a water for a half an hour. 

You can use the facilities for an hour before the massage. 

Would recommend even if pricey. ",4,2016,02,20
206,Valentines La Drunch ,"I would personally recommened anyone to stay or eat out at this hotel. We were only at the hotel for La Drunch and because the service and food was so amazing I will defiantly be returning for an over night stay. Our table was served by a waiter named Patrick who was amazing,  nothing was too much trouble for him and he took time to answer all of our 100 questions about the cocktails. We had fish and chips and the waffles and chicken and both were amazing. The cocktails were the nicest I have tasted in Dublin. Thanks Patrick for all your amazing help he is a credit to your hotel üòä",5,2016,02,18
206,Excellent Hotel,"This hotel provides everything you could want in a hotel stay.  The rooms are big, bright, spacious, comfortable and immaculately clean.  A little bit of a distance to the city centre but it is walkable depending on the weather.  If you take a taxi expect a minimum fare of ‚Ç¨10, depending on traffic. No problem with getting taxis and the staff are really helpful.  Perfect location for the 3Arena or the Bord Gais Energy Theatre (literally across the street).  Breakfasts here were lovely.",4,2016,02,17
206,Lovely stay !,"Stayed in this hotel for the weekend and loved it ! It is within walking distance of most places but not so far into the centre that it was busy and rowdy .
The staff were all super friendly and helpful . The room was very comfortable and cosy . We had a lovely view of the river .
We had breakfast on Saturday, which was super yummy (although no non-pork options!). In the evening, we had a drink at the bar in the lobby, which was nice and chilled. We didn't have a chance to use the pool or gym (which were complementary) but we plan on trying them out when we next stay there ! Really recommend this hotel .",5,2016,02,17
206,A delight!,"We called to The Marker for a food and wine pairing night and I was blown away by the staff's attentiveness, they were incredible! We started in the rooftop bar with a selection of canap√©s and a white port cocktail, yum and a teaser of what was to come.
The food was carefully paired to the wines which were introduced before each course and the executive chef also regaled all present with the thinking behind to menu.
All in all, an incredible night and I cannot wait for the next offering.",5,2016,02,17
206,Top Class,"Stayed for 3 nights to celebrate my 30th Birthday and also valentines. Can not fault a single thing about the hotel, the staff or the service. All round excellence. Room was beautiful and serviced each day. Hotel food was simply delicious. Dev in the hotel bar really deserves a mention for his excellent service and manner that we experienced on Monday night, as does Christina on reception who booked us tickets and advised us on our trip to Guinness Storehouse. Looking forward to staying again",5,2016,02,17
206,Great hotel and walking distance to the city centre,"I LOVE this hotel, the rooms are great, love the decor. Fantastic bathrooms! Great bar to people watch the glamorous Dublin lifestyle. The rooftop bar is fantastic when the weather is good. Night manager had coffee and breakfast to go bag ready for me as I was departing for an early transatlantic flight, very nice touch! Would absolutely recommend.",5,2016,02,16
206,Just wow!,"Firstly, well done to all the staff at this hotel, genuine charm and warmth on arrival, nothing too much trouble, great views, stunning food in the restaurant and the breakfast was brilliant. So good I have booked to go back already!!",5,2016,02,15
206,Marvelous Marker,"I can not fault this hotel. It was immaculately clean, the staff were so polite and helpful and they had everything you could think of. It was within easy walking distance of the city and on all the major bus routes. The breakfast was tasty and there was lots to choose from while the menu in the brasseries looked lovely we did not eat in the hotel as we were out seeing the sights most of the time. ",5,2016,02,15
206,Beautiful,"When we arrived the staff immediately took our bags, the check in staff were so so friendly and made everything very easy. The room was gorgeous -on both occasions that i stayed here. And the spa was great!",5,2016,02,15
206,Excellent 2 day social visit to Dublin,"We had a delightful stay in The Marker. Location is excellent. Locality is vibrant with Theatres, restaurants, walks, etc.We highly recommend it.  In house casual dining perfect for a light evening meal. Ambience relaxing.",5,2016,02,15
206,Most excellent and beautiful Hotel,"Most Professional staff, friendly and proactive. They make sure you have all you need and nothing is missed out. I had the best breakfast experience, even though the buffet was a little short. Friendly greetings and asking me if I want the paper, Toast, juice and so on is the small things that made the stay very pleasant.",5,2016,02,14
206,Amazing service. ,"All
I have to say is good things about this hotel, every member of staff is trained to the highest standard.. Not one fault at all with this hotel... Arrival and check in was professional and quick, we was given a upgrade to an amazing room 418 with a superb view! Didn't get a chance to eat at the hotel but I can imagine the food was good given the standards I had seen. Pool and spa was amazing so clean! Checked regularly when we visited. The shampoo and conditioner are great products! Honestly just a brilliant hotel and I would tell anyone and everyone to stay here atleast once if you are heading to Dublin! The store across the road called FRESH is worth a visit aswel! Thank you the marker! ",5,2016,02,14
206,Business stay,"The room was very comfortable and location is well connected. Service staff are very warm, friendly and eager to help - they even take care of any extra ordinary requests you may have.  I stayed most recently on a business trip and they are very well suited to cater to an international audience",5,2016,02,14
206,Modern luxury - fab!,"I stayed here with a friend for one night recently - it is a gorgeous modern and comfortable hotel. The girl at check in was really helpful - she helped us find our venue for the gig we were going to and was very pleasant. Our room was good sized and the bed was very comfortable. I had a great nights sleep and our room on the 5th floor was very quiet. We didn't eat there but I am planning to go down again and have dinner in the brasserrie.
It took as about 20 mins to walk to our gig on oconnell street and 20 to walk to grafton street the next day so it is slightly away from everything - which we didn't mind but do bear this in mind if you're looking for a hotel in the thick of it! ",5,2016,02,14
206,Fabulous but not exceptional,"This hotel could not be in a better location. A superb example of modern architecture and interior design. All of the staff, from housekeeping through to senior management are well trained, friendly, discreet and should feel an example to their profession. Food, both in the evening and at breakfast is very good. The bedroom we had was spacious, well appointed and well soundproofed - I don't recall hearing one door bang or anyone talking in the corridor outside. The bathroom was very well appointed, but not well thought out from an accessible point of view - grab rails are not really in the right places, the shower stool was very slippery and the shower has a high, fixed head. Although I am very active and independent in the wheelchair, I would be cautious of using the shower if my partner was not staying with me.",4,2016,02,13
206,Extraordinary Hotel in perfect location,"The Marker was a very positive suprise during my visit in Dublin. It is located perfectly close to the city center, walking distance from many sites and has a very high, yet modern, standard. I can definitely recommend the Marker for business travel.",5,2016,02,12
206,'' Most Amazing Hotel in Dublin '',I haven't stay at the Marker Hotel  in Dublin with my family yet .  Perfect Location . The Marker is the most amazing hotel in Dublin . I LOVE THE MOST AMAZING HOTEL IN DUBLIN IS THE MARKER HOTEL .  its a  fantastic hotel. The views are great .,5,2016,02,11
206,Superb facilities and outstanding service,"From the minute I decanted from the taxi on arrival at the hotel to the moment I checked out 3 days later; the service, professionalism, warmth and friendliness of EVERY member of the staff was superb.",5,2016,02,11
206,A gem in the heart of grand canal square,"I stayed here recently and the marker is truly a real Gem. The staff , location, facilities and general atmosphere is fantastic. The hotel offers 5 star luxury in the heart of the capital city. The pool and spa facilities are excellent. The bedroom amazing and not a disturbance to be had. I'd highly recommend the Marker for a stay in Dublin",5,2016,02,10
206,Fantastic stay at The Marker,"We got the chance to stay at The Marker late in January. Was looking forward to it for some time and it did not dissapoint. Great hotel, fantastic room and view from it, prompt and smooth service. We had a very relaxing time and are already planning a return trip.",4,2016,02,10
206,Fab night in gorgeous Hotel,"Our stay at the Marker was fantastic. The service was exceptional. Greeted by the door man as my taxi door opened, he escorted me to the check in desk as he carried my bags, so friendly and welcoming. Check in was swift with lots of info on the facilities at the hotel. The person who I checked in with as as lovely and welcoming as the door man and also carried my bags to the room and then showed me the various room facilities. The room was gorgeous, clean, warm, and had everything I needed. The deep bath, big shower and underfloor heating made the bathroom pretty special. I had room service twice which came promptly with a great attentiveness from the staff. I couldn't recommend the Marker higher. Apart from the hotel being gorgeous the staff really make this a fab place to stay.",5,2016,02,10
206,Ridiculously kind & professional staff,"My husband and I stayed for four nights. Our trip was a combination of a little of business that happened to coincide with our 10yr anniversary. This hotel fit the bill for both. The staff were extremely helpful and kind but yet very quiet, almost ""seen & not heard."" Our anniversary was acknowledged with some small chocolate tarts on a plate with ""Happy Anniversary"" written in chocolate sauce, and an accompanying note of congratulations. They also left a rose with chocolates on either side of our bed the first evening. Our room was cleaned impeccably each day, even moving our shoes to vacuum and setting our toiletries up neatly on a washcloth each time. Very detail-oriented. The pool was gorgeous but we only got in the jacuzzi, which felt wonderful and was in a much more spa-like, relaxing atmosphere than any hotel pool I've ever experienced. Just everything about this hotel was pure excellence.",5,2016,02,09
206,Top class hotel!,"Lovely hotel, absolute attention to detail. I think the little touches were lovely! I.e, the booking name on the homepage of the tele, the decoration on the chocolate strawberries. & not to mention room service - outstanding!

Loved the touch of the flower in the little bowl & the fold away trolley/table. The food was to die for, could of lived off their curry!

Breakfast was lovely too. A variety of cooked & continental choices. Again, you're waited on hand & food.

Staff are really friendly & will help with any of your requirements.

Overall, fully recommended!",5,2016,02,09
206,Wonderful 30th birthday experience,"The hotel is modern, comfortable and - although pricey - a brilliant choice for a special trip away. 

We visited for my partner's 30th and the hotel staff did everything they could do make our stay perfect. Beforehand they helped to arrange amenities in the room on arrival, as well as a spa treatment and breakfast (try the cronuts!). They were also extremely attentive during our stay - nothing was too much trouble.

The facilities are also great. I made full use of the pool and sauna, while my parents enjoyed his spa treatments. The bedrooms are comfortable - especially the bed - and with 24-hour room service there's not much more you could ask for.

We loved the location too. Dublin is pretty compact so it's only a short walk to the city centre (15-20 minutes, depending on pace) and a skip over to the Aviva stadium (10-15 minutes) if you're there for a game. It's very peaceful by the canal, and there are some great little cafes about for a bite to eat. Or, if you want a treat, try The Marker Bar. It was probably the best lunch we had!",5,2016,02,09
206,Mary L,"We had lunch with little time to spare before the afternoon theatre performance.When we explained this, the staff were very prompt and helpful, ensuring  that we got to the theatre on time , after a delicious  lunch. We returned to the Brasserie  afterwards  and the staff had no problem moving our booking forward as we had arrived too early. The food was mouth - watering and everyone in our party , including a very elderly lady, was  so well attended on, that we decided  we will definitely  make the Marker our favourite  place to eat when in Dublin. Reception, Bar and Waiting Staff all very welcoming and pleasant. Although  we didn't stay in the hotel, I am certain that the high standards we evidenced as non - residential guests are equally experienced  by all guests. Thank you. ",5,2016,02,08
206,Excellent hotel and staff,"Really enjoyed our trip.  Hotel was lovely, excellent service, food and staff.  All staff so friendly going the extra mile.  The overall pool and spa is the best we have been to again staff  lovely in there too.  Lovely atmosphere in the bar.  Rooms spacious, extremely clean with all you need.  Prices a little more than some other hotels but you get what you pay for and a little extra here.",5,2016,02,08
206,Great Hotel,"I stayed at The Marker for a one night business trip. I found the staff were cheerful & very attentive. The room was lovely, very spacious with an extremely comfortable bed. The bathroom was amazing with good quality complementary toiletries. The location was great for my purposes, maybe a touch too far from the centre of Dublin for some peoples liking.",5,2016,02,08
206,A really lovely pre theatre venue,"I visited the Marker Bar in the hotel for a pre theatre bite to eat with my parents this week and it was a really great experience.  The staff were very warm and service very professional. The choice of food was really good - something for all taste & appetites- and top quality.  My Mum ordered the Open Sandwich and was blown away by the 'trio' selection but specifically the Chicken on baby gem leaves - she passed on her compliments to the chef suggesting that it was possibly the best flavoured chicken dish 'ever'.  I enjoyed the Sea Bass - a lovely fillet and perfect portion size.  We have dined in the restaurant, which is always lovely, but the atmosphere, service and quality in the Bar was perfect for a pre theatre venue and we will definitely be back.",5,2016,02,05
206,5 star experience in the city,"fantastic hotel great location staff very friendly and excellent facilities, a real gem in grand canal square which is only a 10 minute walk from grafton street. the hotel is a hub at the centre of hanover quay with the bord gais theatre across from entrance and the lir theatre close by too. id highly recommend the Marker Hotel for a mighty city break in the capital city of Dublin,Dublin is a fantastic city with lots to do from its great eateries and public houses not to mention the various arts and cultural activities. go visit and stay in the Marker Hotel a 5 star experience that will definitely want you to return again soon. I highly recommend the Marker Hotel",5,2016,02,03
206,A Wonderful Hotel to spend a special occasion,"We arrived to a very welcoming receptionist where we were going to store our bags as we were a few hours away from check out and was very pleased to find out that our room was ready. The room was massive/clean and had a lovely view over the square which lit up in the evening. Nothing was a problem from asking for advice to asking for some different pillows. First class. We didn't try the food but we did use the swimming pool and gym which was full of high specification equipment. We would definitely stay here again and recommend to everyone. 
Only thing I would say if you want to be in the heart of Dublin, this is not the hotel for you. It was a good 20 minute walk to Trinity College. We used the hop on hop off bus (green one) which had a dockland tour which connected you to the original tour and the sights. We had to use taxis a few times to get back to the hotel and theses ranged from 6 to 12 euro depending on time and where we were in the city.",5,2016,02,02
206,Perfect Hotel in Dublin,"I have stayed at numerous hotels in & around Dublin over the past few years for business and for fun, including The Merrion, Crown Plaza, the Intercontinental, the Gibson, and Trinity City. However, on a recent trip to Dublin The Marker won my heart and I will never stay anywhere else in the city (if I can help it). 

Advantages are many, but I should highlight the following. The rooms are all essentially identical, which appeals to my egalitarian side. I detest hotels where only blind luck (or the kindness of the desk staff) determines whether you end up in a spacious suite or a basement room smelling of cigarette smoke. The Marker has neither and, as a result, you know exactly what you are getting and it is good! 

The rooms are perfectly silent and come equipped with comfortable beds, and unexpected luxurious touches, such as floor to ceiling marble bathrooms with heated floors, fabulous toiletries, in-room french presses for coffee, etc. etc. etc. The restaurant in the hotel is surprisingly good and the rooftop bar is fun. The location is very convenient. Finally, the staff is professional and accommodating. What more do you really need?",5,2016,02,02
206,Top class,"From start to finish the whole experience was magnificent. Staff were always at hand to help without ever being overbearing or in the way. The room was pristine and the view of the square fantastic. The pool is amazing, and so relaxing. And the breakfast buffet absolutely stunning. I will definitely be going back",5,2016,02,02
206,Nice Place to stay,"Had a great stay there with my wife - great meal -service was amazing- staff were fantastic,  rooms and spa facilities were excellent. Great place to stay for Bord Gais shows as well if I can afford it I would certainly go back there again.",5,2016,02,02
206,"It's my birthday, she's been there now it's my turn !","Such s lovely place .. Love the feeling on arrival, like the way they make a fuss of you without being false .. Room, view, food .. amazing. So close to city and such a great feeling of newness! This made me feel special, treats like this is so important ! ",4,2016,01,31
206,Great Hotel!,"Great hotel, definitely one of the best in Dublin. Everything was right, I can recommend to everyone! Could be a bitter closer to public transport but it is not bad and you can always take a taxi when needed.",5,2016,01,30
206,Collection  launch / press event  2016  for IE market,I've been staying in The Marker  hotel several times  now. I organize our company events  there 2 times a year since the hotel has been opened. I love the architecture & the interior. The service is efficient  but very friendly. Food & selection of wine  very good . I've also used a Spa  during my latest visit  - excellent  massage! Great place to stay  & use it for a  company event.,5,2016,01,29
206,Absolutely top quality hotel,"My stay at the Marker could be best described as perfect. Staff were very friendly, courteous and helpful with any questions. The room was spacious and very comfortable and breakfast was also very good.",5,2016,01,29
206,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed in the Marker for one night, such a fantastic and modern 5* hotel.  At the time of booking a promotion was on that benefitted us with a complimentary upgrade to the next room tier - in our case, a corner suite.

Our suite was large in size, huge bed, table and seating area, and desk to work at.  The bathroom had a large bath and separate shower.  The heated floor was a nice touch!

All the staff we encountered were incredibly friendly and helpful, the hotel was very modern and stylish inside.  We spent some time on the roof-top bar, such a great place to grab a drink!  It gets very busy during the summer!

We would happily stay at the Marker again and have already recommended it to family and friends!  Hopefully we'll be returning again in the near future!",5,2016,01,28
206,Exceptional Hotel,"Just back from a wonderful weekend away The Marker Hotel , Dublin. We stayed there before shortly after it opened but our experience this weekend was not comparable. They have achieved something extraordinary in the hotel over the last couple of years. From arrival to departure we were treated in a friendly and interested manner. The staff were not pretentious whatsoever. The room was beautiful and could not be faulted. We had drinks in the hotel and breakfast and our experience in the bar and in the dining room were brilliant. The breakfast servers were amazing and could not have been more attentive. Food was hot, high quality and plentiful-well worth booking breakfast for the experience alone. We found the valet parking to be great. Car was taken and delivered back within 5 minutes. The young doorman was a lovely guy, friendly and not pretentious or snooty in any way.We were delighted to receive 2 bottles of freezing cold water waiting in our car for the drive home. These little touches are what make this hotel one of the best in Dublin. From start to finish we were right at home which is exactly how you should feel. The staff are the best in the business. We cannot wait for our next stay in The Marker and highly recommend this hotel for a luxurious stay in Dublin. Worth splashing out for!",5,2016,01,26
206,Excellent experience,"From the moment we arrived at reception, the staff made us feel valued and were friendly and helpful. The food was lovely and coupled with an evening at a nearby theatre out stay was fantastic.  I would highly recomend this hotel to anyone who values high standards of service and accomodation.",5,2016,01,26
206,Very professional hotel,"The staff here were really good, nothing is too much trouble and everything is dealt with very professionally. Food was good, nothing amazing but just really nice for eating in the bar. The only thing i could fault it for and it is maybe been a bit harsh, was that it lacked a bit of personality. That aside I would happily stay here or recommend it, pool area is nice a well.",4,2016,01,25
206,Nice hotel,"Very modern - though not at all Irish 
Also not near center of town

But food was great and room was well equipped modern and clean.

I still didn't understand why there was a door hanger for a fire (like maid service or do not disturb). If there is a fire I am leaving, not leaving a note on the door!

If you are looking for an Irish hotel - this is not it - if you are looking for a hip urban hotel in Dublin this is your place",4,2016,01,25
206,Amazing,Well worth the price amazing hotel and amazing staff. The swimming pool and sauna was 5 star with a great atmosphere and not to crowded. Would definitely go back. They also left us 2 bottles of water in our car which was very refreshing. ,5,2016,01,25
206,Luxury,"Check in experience very good. Breakfast was very good and staff extremely friendly and efficient. Large bedroom with great shower. Great pool, great service. Wood stay again when visiting Dublin. Weather in January was fantastic, how lucky were we.",5,2016,01,25
206,Excellent ,"Excellent hotel - special mention to Daniel on concierge/valet parking - breakfast very tasty plenty of choice - rooms clean and spacious. Can recommend the cocktails would definitely stay again 

Parking available at ‚Ç¨24 euro a night plus rooms have a choice of pillows etc all in all a very comfortable stay ",5,2016,01,24
206,"Lovely hotel, great staff...","This was a lovely hotel and didn't disappoint!! The room was lovely and spacious and had a nice choice of items in the minibar. The bathroom was much bigger than expected and the heated underfloor was a great touch üòä
I have to mention Zoltan, who served us at breakfast...fantastic member of staff, very attentive and welcoming.

We stayed in this hotel as we attended an event at the arena. It's in the business district with great views and a couple of local restaurants. It's around 20 minutes walk to the centre and about 30 minutes from the main shopping street. All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel üòä

Oh and the Spa is AMAZING!!",5,2016,01,24
206,A  big disappointment,"The marker hotel sounds and looks great on paper so had pretty high expectations for my stay here but it turned out to be a disappointment. First of all the positives were the location (great as we were going to a gig in the 3arena) and the room was very spacious with a huge bathroom.

The negatives were that when I booked the room I selected to have chocolates in the room, no sign of chocolates when I arrived. Rang reception and they offered to bring them up to the room but I declined as the surprise was ruined at that stage so they obliged me and cancelled it but not once was an apology offered for the chocolates not being there in the first place. Was later rang back by a different staff member who proceeded to apologize and offered some complimentary champagne, all very nice so accepted and waited for it to be dropped up, an hour passed and no sign of it so we ended up leaving the room to get dinner as we were too hungry too wait any longer. We went down to the bar and ordered two of the burgers and some drinks, burgers were grand except for my girlfriend finding a hair in hers and I receiving a pint instead of a bottle like I had ordered, at this stage decided there was no point in saying anymore. Was also met with a long queue and wait to check out the the following morning. Overall a very disappointing experience for what I had expected and also paid a lot of money for, very expensive for that kind of experience.",2,2016,01,23
206,Fantastic Contemporary Hotel,"We had just one night at The Marker at the end of a trip to Ireland, but what a fun night it was. Our room looked out over the Grand Canal Square and that in itself is worth seeing at night ~ the lighting is just beautiful.

We had a King room with a roll-away, and it was comfortable and modern.  The bathroom was modern with a soaking tub and walk-in shower; one could spend hours in there pampering oneself,  after an hour or two in the incredible spa and pool on the bottom floor of the hotel!  Take a look at the hotel's web-site to see the spa and hotel images.

We enjoyed drinks in the bar and a light dinner, which was very busy with theater goers from a production next door. In the morning breakfast was served in the restaurant and it was very good. Service was excellent from the front desk to the bar to the restaurant. A stroll through the plaza at night with all the lights is a must. The contemporary decor and design of The Marker is superb. Highly recommend.",5,2016,01,23
206,favourite hotel in dublin,"The Marker is one of the newest hotels in Dublin and this is reflected in its contemporary and trendy design. I was quite impressed with the room. More spacious and stylish (imo)  than either the Westin or the Westbury. The bathroom was also very roomy and the shower was a wet room approach, which is disabled-friendly. The only trade-off here is location - not in the middle of the city centre but having lived in Dublin for 10 yrs previously, not an issue for me. Another option for those willing to forego the city centre is the Gibson across the river. Also stayed there recently and again is more spacious than city centre equivalents with nice appointed rooms but is not quite as good as the Marker. Gibson does have the tram on its doorstep however. If you prefer old world charm and a city centre location, go for the westin - rooms are cramped in the westbury.",5,2016,01,23
206,Great for business,I stayed three nights at the Marker on a business trip for a conference at the Convention Center.  The hotel is conveniently located a short walk across the river from that facility.  We arrived early Sunday morning on a flight from the States and were able to check in early.  The rooms were comfortable and spotless.  The wi-fi worked great.  Breakfast included in the room rate was top quality.  Best of all was service from the entire staff.,5,2016,01,22
206,Doomed by an upgrade!,"My suite upgrade didn't work out quite as expected! Air conditioning was not working (day 1), no hot water pressure (day 2), no heat (day 3). Friendly staff was apologetic and responsive but seems that the above is a pretty basic set of expectations for an hotel of this category.",2,2016,01,21
206,"Great location, nice stay",We went to a show in the Bord Gais and we decided to stay at The Marker. It was a very nice hotel. Modern and funky. The roof top bar was the highlight of our stay there. It was very relaxing with an urban chic vibe.,4,2016,01,20
206,Marker Hotel,"Gorgeous modern luxury hotel in the City Centre.  Exceptionally nice and friendly staff, lovely facilities. Perfect for a stay in Dublin in terms of location and comfort.   Close to BGE Theatre,  Stay the night,  go to show and into Harrys Bar afterwards for an interesting and fun night.",5,2016,01,18
206,The friendliest staff ever !!!!,"My wife and I have just returned home after a stay at The Marker. Never before in 40 years travelling have we ever experienced friendlier or more customer focused staff than at The Marker. Each and everyone of them made us feel welcome.

Check in and out with Stefan was so easy and our room facing the Square had a marvellous view. It was very spacious as was the bathroom and all immaculately clean. The bed was huge and very comfortable. Complimentary wifi, tea and coffee making facilities and an honesty bar all added to the experience.

We had both lunch and dinner in the Marker Bar and both were beautifully presented and very tasty. The staff were always very attentive. The bar was buzzing with people creating a great atmosphere. 

After a great nights sleep we enjoyed a hearty breakfast. There was an extensive selection of hot and cold foods from which to choose and plenty of tea and coffee.

When we were leaving the hotel our car was brought to the door for us and they left two bottles of water inside for the journey,  a lovely touch.

So if you go to Dublin stay in this amazing hotel and enjoy the experience as we did.",5,2016,01,17
206,Beautiful hotel perfect location,"I love this hotel.. Me and my partner stayed here for 1 night and was much better than expected. The rooms were huge and very stylish. You must visit the roof top bar for some cocktails, you can see the whole city. would 100% recommend this hotel.",5,2016,01,17
206,Excellent staff,"Stayed this week at The Marker Dublin.  Excellent staff and great breakfast, the pancakes with fresh fruit are a must.  Great leisure facilities and conference rooms.  Will most definitely be back the next time I am in Dublin.",5,2016,01,15
206,Christmas drinks with kids,"went in here for a drink while we waited for at show at the bord gais. Staff are friendly and well trained.
Was involved at the opening of the hotel a few years ago and for a city centre hotel the pool and spa are a real treat and luxurious. Very contemporary setting all round . If you haven't been its a lovely new treat.",5,2016,01,13
206,pre Theatre meal,Having had great experience on arrival the the hotel met by a valet at the door who took our car and parked it for us - we checked in and booked a meal in the Brassiere for 5.45pm giving us plenty time for the theatre to start at 7.30pm - Ordered our food starters arrived in good time and were tasty - however main course was a least 20 mins later and delivered to a serving table by another waiter - which sat there for at least 5 mins before our own waiter was finished imputing items on the till and brought the food to us as a result my husband steak was cold - we didnt make  a fuss so moved on and ordered dessert at about 6.45pm giving us plenty time to enjoy - However at 7.05pm the waiter came back to us and apologised that due to a mix up in the kitchen we wouldnt have time to have the dessert ! so we paid for our meal and left - The restaurant experience was a pity really as everything else was really enjoyable,4,2016,01,11
206,Friendly staff!,"First visit, pre-show on a very saturated Saturday eve, busy, but staff still attentive, pleasant, helpful, interacted with the kids... superbly imaginative Mary Poppins themed dessert for kids added to the magic and anticipation... oh and divine cocktails for the adultsüòâ",5,2016,01,10
206,Does not get any better!,This hotel is along side the Shelbourne as the best hotel in Dublin. Simply faultless. Fabulous rooms. Brilliant staff. If you get the opportunity to stay here. Do!!!!!  Food is off the charts. It's a modern hotel and very slick.  It's also in a great location with bars and restaurants a walk away. ,5,2016,01,10
206,Excellent Standards & Service,"Every year, we make our annual trip to Dublin to celebrate Xmas for special reasons.  Each time we have stayed, it has been with the Marker!  What do I say, if you keep going back somewhere...... actions always speak louder than words.  The service is just that little bit special and we appreciate that greatly...... Just love it.",5,2016,01,07
206,New Years bash,"Visited the marker hotel for a 4 day break over New Years, everything about the hotel is 5* .  Staff were excellent and the accommodation was spotless,food excellent but didn't use the main restaurant but many people did...
Would definatley recommend this hotel",5,2016,01,05
206,New Year's Eve trip away,"Absolutely excellent, we arrived early to leave our bags at 10.45 and was told our room was ready which was a massive bonus considering we was not supposed to check in until 3pm. New Year's Eve meal was amazing and they couldn't of catered for us better as we have allergies!! Spa facilities where spot on my massage was amazing the best massage I've ever had and I thought St Andrews Scotland was had to beat in regards to the spa. Lovely hotel and would definitely recommend. Thanks so much for making our stay so enjoyable.",5,2016,01,04
206,Awesome!,"The MARKER is a great hotel - centrally located, professional staff and all required facilities on hand. I really loved it. The check-in and check-out process were quick and efficient. The staff were extremely professional from the front office to the gym.",5,2016,01,04
206,Christmas Stay,"Annual Christmas night in Dublin.  Nice roof top bar, unfortunately was closed on night of stay but got to take some photos there. Check opening times when staying.   Staff were very helpful and friendly. Good location, Close to city center.  Rooms are very nice and quiet for a relaxing stay.    Would definitely stay again.",5,2016,01,04
206,Marvelous Short Break Destination,"My wife and I stayed in The Marker from 27th to 29th December last. We made up our own City Break by taking the Enterprise from Belfast ( First Class; not expensive for what you get ), sauntered from Connelly to The Marker. The Marker is a proper 5 star hotel in every respect : fine food, great service, top notch Spa and infinity swimming pool, great room. Tip, book a room overlooking the square and canal. We didn't bother eating out as the dining was that good. A trip on the Luas from St Stephens's Green to Dundrum Shopping Centre very rewarding. Good time of year to visit Dublin as most places of interest were open but the place was pleasantly deserted.",5,2016,01,04
206,New years at the Marker,"We booked the marker hotel due to its brilliant trip advisor reviews during our stay in Dublin for new years. Needless to say we were definitely not disappointed!

 We arrived early at 10.45am to drop off bags before heading into Dublin center, as check in is usually 3pm. We were greeted my a number of very friendly staff and were informed our room was already available. This was a huge bonus as it gave us chance to unwind before venturing out. 

We were given information about a complementary drinks and canap√©s reception for new years eve which was a lovely touch. This was in a function room which was very well laid out. The general manager Mr Charlie Sheil gave us a personal welcome and took a genuine interest as to our evening plans. He also informed us there would be a drinks reception on the rooftop bar at midnight. 

We returned to the hotel later that evening to see in the new year on the rooftop bar. We were greeted with complementary port and cheese board, again just extra touches which really made us feel welcome throughout our stay.

The room was spotless, the spa facilities were excellent and the massages we had were amazing, I'd highly recommend. 

Breakfast each morning was superb and service was always prompt and friendly.

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin.  It is a little out of the way but it is easily walkable from the center which takes a pleasant 15 mins. Alternatively a taxi can be arranged through the hotel for around ‚Ç¨7. The surrounding area on the docks has been recently redeveloped and has a very modern feel. 

Thanks to all staff at the marker for making our stay so enjoyable. 
",5,2016,01,03
206,Good hotel with great service,"we spent new year's eve at the marker. we are a family with 3 kids and we were well taken care of. although the hotel is big and could feel very coroprate like, it was surprisingly very nice thanks to very kind and helpful staff. robert at the concierge was just great and super efficient! the pool is nice and overall, although it is not very special, we had a good time at the marker.",4,2016,01,02
206,Fabulous Hotel,"From the moment the valet chap sweeped us into the hotel and we got an efficient  checkin with super restaurant recommendations I knew we picked the right hotel. 

Great facilities with exceptional service and fabulous rooms, this hotel offers everything to the young and modern traveller. 

Great bar with wide selection of drinks served with great nibbles. 

Only ten mins from the city centre, could not be any closer to the theatre if you tried.",5,2016,01,01
206,Lovely Weekend,"Everything you would expect from a five star hotel, the service and attention to detail was excellent. Food in the restaurant was also excellent. The bar had a good range of drinks and a great Cocktail menu. The hotel is in a good location in the financial quarter and only 20 min walk into town.",5,2016,01,01
206,Marker Hotel,Everything about this hotel was first class and we had a very enjoyable stay. The staff went out of their way to please you and we all felt very special for the night that we stayed. Would definately recommend to anyone you fancies a treat.,5,2016,01,01
206,A Very Memorable Birthday Treat ,"I stayed on the night of the 28th December with my girlfriend for her birthday. The stay exceeded our expectations in every possible way. 

The lady who checked us in (Zaige?) Was incredibly friendly personable and welcoming arranging for our bags to be taken to our room and walking is personally to the lifts. Peter who checked us out was also superb storing it luggage for a couple of hours whilst we went shopping into the town centre. Zoltan was also incredibly friendly and we appreciated it. 

Throughout the stay every staff member we encountered was beyond helpful friendly and polite. Everyone smiled and genuinely made us feel like we had their total and genuine attention. 

The spa is wonderful luxurious and spotless. We spent hours there enjoying the facilities on both days. 

The breakfast was delicious and service first class. The whole weekend was filed with little treats such as bottles of water in my car for the drive home. Umbrellas were provided to us when we went out a walk. Bags carried and doors opened too.

My girlfriend particularly loved the cake sent to our room for her birthday. It was a very unexpected treat that we appreciated.

The room was spacious spotless and luxurious. Very well equipped also. The bathroom was huge. Fast wifi and refreshments in the room were additional comforts. Very modern and very comfortable. 

I have and will continue to recommend this hotel. It was out first stay and we would love to come back again. 

All the staff are a real credit to this hotel. Thank you. ",5,2015,12,31
206,Amazing Stay,"Great hotel and very enjoyable stay.

The room was large, modern and very clean.  Could not fault it at all.

The Spa was great and the pool area was just amazing.

The bar area was great but my only criticism was that later on at 10.30ish the bar was very busy and it was difficult to get seats and the bar staff we over stretched. 

However staff were fantastic and attended to all our needs promptly and professionally.

Location is slightly out of the main area of Dublin but it was only a 15 min walk (or 10 euro taxi) to the temple bar  / grafton street area.

Will definitely be back",4,2015,12,31
206,Amazing hotel with fantastic staff!,"Can't recommend this hotel enough. Great location, fantastic staff who couldn't do enough for us. The rooms were great. Big and very clean. With tea and coffee facilities and a stocked mini bar. The pool and spa were a haven of relaxation with slippers and bath robes provided. I will definitely be back to The Marker!!",5,2015,12,30
206,Cool contemporary decor & amazing service,"I had a sensational stay at this hotel !  I was working in Dublin and stayed for 4 days.

I loved the rooms, the bar and restaurant and the pool - great spaces, I loved the design and enjoyed the food and cocktails.

Service from the manager and the staff was sensation - I had to move rooms as I had made a booking error - this was sorted out quickly and efficiently - and the staff couldn't be helpful enough sorting out my various requirements during the stay including losing my mobile phone ! 

I can't wait to stay again - my only regret is not getting to try the rooftop bar !",5,2015,12,30
206,An Amazing Experience,"I live just across the water from the Marker, I have been in it many of times, I'm a massive fan of the there trendy roof top bar.  I was in the middle of doing renovations on my apartment when I just got fed up of it all I decided I was going to check into a hotel for a 2 night break.  I walked into the hotel & they connected me to Catriona in reservations, she actually came out of her office to meet me which was very professional and gave me a special rate as I'm a neighbour of the hotel.  Well because I was so impressed with the Marker my 2 night break that I checked into actually turned into 6 nights.  The place is an oasis of calm in the hustle and bustle which is Dublin & it completely de-stressed me after a very busy month of renovations.  The rooms are spacious and very luxurious & I just loved the fabulous bathroom.  The Spa is truly magnificent you let all your worries go and completely relax & the pool setting is tranquillity with a modern twist.  They food is excellent and I was well impressed as there menu promotes the best of Irish produce which I love to see any Irish Hotel or Restaurant doing & the menu has a wide range of various options to suit every need.  But the best thing about this hotel is its staff and the level of service standards on a number of occasions they went on and above the level of service you would expect of any hotel for example, on one the nights before I went out I noticed a button had fallen off my coat, I went down to reception to get a sewing kit to so it back on myself, at reception they told me to take the jacket down and they would have the button sewn back on for me, I was so impressed that act of kindness made my night.  There simple attention to detail does not make this hotel a good hotel, it makes it a great hotel, it is Irish Hospitality at it best and other hotels could take a leaf out of its book.  I can see why its a member of The Leading Hotels Of The World, it belongs in that club & the management should be very proud of its staff.  Even though I just live across the way from it and can see it out of my window I know I'll be checking back into it again when I need a little break from the world.",5,2015,12,26
206,Fantastic Hotel,We stay during business /please trip to Dublin and we couldn't be happier with our choice. All was great and specially recumbent to visit pool and spa area.   We tried both restaurants and were great even with special requests as I am vegan and is always a challenge when I am abroad. They did great job.,5,2015,12,22
206,phillip,Beautiful hotel beside theatre and in lovely location. Very good staff and food. Rooms very modern and comfortable. Concierge particularly pleasant and helpful. Roof top lounge is a must. Would definitely visit again perfect for Bord Gais Theatre.,5,2015,12,22
206,"Beautiful Spa Hotel, Poor location","First, and foremost, this is a stunning hotel! The rooms, spa, pool, and other facilities are top notch; I was very pleasantly surprised by how wonderful it was! 

The service, from the moment our party arrived until the moment we departed, far exceeded our expectations. Being unfamiliar with the city, the concierge took care of all of our needs throughout our stay and introduced us to one of the best meals we've ever had at one of the local gastro pubs. At every interaction they provided options that suited our tastes and budgets.

This hotel offers an incredible spa and fitness facility. What you see in the professional photos is actually what you get. 

The rooms were of a very generous size, with large bathrooms. Comparable to upscale North American Hotels we've stayed in. It was almost too much space for two people and certainly unexpected since we have not found this to be the norm in Europe/the UK. This was not a positive for us as we quite enjoy our small boutique hotel experiences when visiting this, and other, part(s) of the world but there are far worse things one can complain about!

Our room package came with breakfast each morning and it did not disappoint as well. They offer very tasty selections, both hot and cold.

I would recommend this hotel for those that are looking to spend their time on site taking advantage of the spa treatments and other facilities but not for those looking to enjoy the sites in and around Dublin. For us, it felt wasteful to be dashing out of such a wonderful place each day and not taking advantage of what the hotel facilities had to offer. 

We would stay here again but spend more time onsite.",5,2015,12,22
206,modern,"stayed in the marker overnight it is a very bright modern hotel in a lovely location,it has a lovely rooftop lounge and outdoor seating with a great view,the room was lovely and had a great breakfast, plenty to choose from,for my taste the hotel lacks intimacy a little bit to open plan for my taste also not cheap thats probably to do with the location.",4,2015,12,21
206,Pre Theatre Dinner at The Brassarie,"Situated in Dublin's Grand Canal Dock beside the Bord Gais Theatre the Marker hotel is the perfect choice for pre Theatre drinks or a meal. We opted for the Pre Evening Show Dinner before Mary Poppins. Food was excellent with some nice touches for the kids with the deserts. Service was as close to perfect as you could ask for. Every member of staff was polite, friendly and excellently trained. Overall it was a great well timed but not rushed experience. Defenately recommend it",5,2015,12,20
206,Beautiful hotel on the Dublin docks!,"Came here with a couple of friends, we casually stormed in for a quick drink & bite and were not dissapointed. Service was great - polite and smiley waitress made it even better and the large sharing platter was delicious! Will be back!",5,2015,12,19
206,A most relaxing experience,"This hotel is a gem in the City of Dublin.  My friend and I stayed here last weekend and were delighted with the entire experience.  The staff were absolutely charming and couldn't have been more helpful, the atmosphere was uber relaxing, and the facilities and accommodation were faultless.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin ...",5,2015,12,16
206,Fantastic Hotel for Work & Fun,"I recently stayed at the Marker for a week-long business trip.  We came in a few days early to explore Dublin.  This was one of the best hotels I've stayed in, especially for the price.  

Our room was made available early, even though the hotel was quite booked.  We had a room on the 5th floor overlooking the Grand Canal.  Bed was comfy, bathroom has nice heated marble floors, a large shower with separate tub, and a heated towel rack.  

My work meetings were held in the hotel conference center which was well equipped, bright, and comfortable.  The staff made sure we had everything we needed.  

The rooftop bar is fantastic when it's open, and is a great place to grab a beer/cocktail or to host a private event (which we did both of while there).  

The lobby bar also has very accommodating staff who remember you and your drink preferences throughout your stay.  

Breakfast in the hotel is a good buffet.  I'm sure there are better options, but if it's included in your rate there is nothing to scoff at.  Hot foods as well as yoghurt, cereal, charcuterie, and juices.  

The especially outstanding portion of our trip was when the hotel restaurant accommodated our group of 30 with zero notice after another local restaurant did not honor our reservation.  The food was very good and the speed with which they pivoted and accommodated us was impressive.

I will definitely be back next time I'm in Dublin!",5,2015,12,15
206,Luxurious 5* Hotel in the Heart of Dublin,"I recently stayed at this hotel for business and I am pleased to say that I enjoyed my experience at The Marker. Its a relatively new hotel in Dublin and its modern furnishing and contemporary design makes a comfortable stay for anyone looking to stop over in Dublin or if you are going down for work. I would say the hotel ranks quite highly if you compare it against some of its other 5* peers in the city (I have previously stayed at the Conrad Dublin and DoubleTree by Hilton).

The rooms are well laid out, with all of your modern conveniences available at your fingertips. The bathrooms are lavish, modern, clean and spacious. Did I forget to add that the marble flooring are also heated? Which makes it a lifesaver on those cold mornings once you have woken up. The beds are very comfortable and the staff are attentive but very helpful. The hotel also has gym facilities and indoor pool/spa facilities. 

My only gripe is that the gym is not 24hrs which can be a pain if you like to head off to the gym late in the evening.",5,2015,12,15
206,Superior,"Excellent service: caring, fast and friendly. Great location. Rooms equipped with everything you need, spacious and beautifully furnished. Modern restaurant with nice view, wide selecetion of breakfast a'la carte and extremeley nice service.",5,2015,12,14
206,"Good hotel , but not central","this is a fine hotel, new , good rooms , expensive bar and restaurant , nice spa , it will take you a good 30 mins to walk into town at a brisk pace , so its a little out of the way. If you are bike city savy then you have a option , otherwise its taxis's all the way which would not be my favourite way to travel .There is a major theatre right beside the hotel so be sure to get a show in .",4,2015,12,14
206,Girls weekend,"We stayed in the Marker hotel in November. I can honestly say it was one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. It was spotlessly clean, the staff couldn't do enough for you and the food was lovely. Attention to detail was spot on. We had 2 treatments each and they also were excellent. Highly recommended",5,2015,12,12
206,Lovely Dublin Hotel,"Great hotel, friendly staff, convenient location, comfortable and quiet hotel rooms - what more could you ask for! They also have great bathrooms, and I especially appreciate the heated floor in the bathroom.",5,2015,12,11

My room was huge and well equipped with coffee, tea, and all accessories you might need on a trip. The service was kind and excellent.
Don't miss the bar ... :-)",5,2015,12,09
206,Irish Hospitality at its best,"We had the most fantastic stay at the Marker. We were going to a show at the 3 Arena so the location is perfect. The staff were extremely friendly at reception. They also were very knowledgeable about airport transfers and locations of bus routes. The breakfast is one of the best we have had, lovely Irish produce. You can tell its popular in the area as there were many people arriving for breakfast only. Restaurant staff also very friendly. Well worth a visit",5,2015,12,09
206,A Perfect Stay,"The Marker was perfect for our 3 night stay in Dublin. The rooms are comfortable and the views are amazing. Breakfast and room service were both excellent, and the gym and wellness spa are a nice size. Most importantly, the service was excellent. Everyone there was friendly, helpful, and so professional, it made our first visit to Dublin a pleasure.",5,2015,12,09

Also I would like 2 thanks Alfredo and Stephen( duty manager) for sorted out little request ( about my voucher.
That's was very kind of you guys.
And that's what we called 
Excellent customer service 

",5,2015,12,07
206,Lunch at The Marker,"I have been to The Marker quite a few times myself, but never with children!!!
They have a fantastic children's menu, ‚Ç¨12 for main and dessert, real food!!!
I hate that a lot of restaurants think all children love chips, mine don't! 
Anyhow, they went for steak with prawn, mash and carrots 
And brother went for pasta!
Dessert was 4 different ones on a plate!!!

The staff so kind and friendly!!!
Thank you x  ",5,2015,12,06
206,Girls luxury night,"Myself and 7 girls recently stayed in the Marker for a girls night away. I dealt with Catriona for my booking and she was extremely pleasant and helpful, and above and beyond to ensure our stay was 5*. When we arrived each of our rooms were upgraded and complimentary chocolates left in our room which was such a lovely and not expected gesture. Catriona reserved an area on the rooftop bar so we could enjoy cocktails under the heaters. The rooms in the Marker are fabulous and the staff are excellent. I would highly recommend the Marker for both business and pleasure.",5,2015,12,04
206,Always a Pleasure,I have to travel to Dublin ever month with work and I will always stay at the Marker. The rooms are massive even in economy and the staff are great. They have a good healthy menu and the staff are good with intolerances (My and Son are Dairy Intolerant). Honestly can't see me looking for another option for a long time.,5,2015,12,03
206,Mary,A fabulous hotel staff v pleasant and friendly our room was very comfortable and relaxing with a great bathroom and amazing  soft fluffy towels and lovely toiletries .  Fabulous breakfast with a great choice of food  On my second morning I got poached eggs which was done to perfection. Our waitress was Elaine who was super. It rained but this didn't spoil our weekend  we have a lovely view which was amazing at night with cool lighting .cant wait to return.,5,2015,11,30
206,Very beautiful,"The room was wide and very welcoming, the indoor pool was surprisingly lengthy and the breakfast was very good. The staff was very helpful. The hotel is within walking distance of the main business area of Dublin. It does not get any better.",5,2015,11,30
206,Fabulous!,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in! In one of my favourites areas in Dublin, very central, everything's walking distance!Amazing staff! Fantastic service! Food in the restaurant downstairs was outstanding again with great service! Top roof bar one of my favourite places! Quiet expensive tho but definitely worth every penny! ",5,2015,11,29
206,Bad breakfast,Better to stay in a B&B.  The taxi service was terrible.  The staff were really friendly and the rooms were very nice.  Location is a little out of the way and with the one way system a bit of a nightmare to get anywhere.,2,2015,11,26
206,Great hotel ,"You know you'll have a great stay the moment you walk in. The staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms are amazing. Also the breakfast is pretty decent. 

I needed to be at the Convention Centre which is just a few minutes walk so location was very convenient. 

Try out the spa on your visit. 

Definitely worth visiting again. ",5,2015,11,25
206,Perfect U2 Gig Accomodation ,"We chose this hotel for our 2nights stay in Dublin on the occasion of the U2 concert in 3 Arena. 
I recommend this option particularly for following reasons:
1) Walking distance to 3 Arena (15mins). On the way back the bike riksha is a romantic, quick and comfortable option.
2) Spend a relaxing day before and/or after in the spacious and relaxing Spa area of the hotel...particularly during rainy and windy days...you will enjoy the gig experience much more relaxed and in tune.
3) Close by to the airport (20mins by taxi)
4) symphathetic staff ...on the other hand, this is apparently not limited to the hotel staff but to the Irish in general.
üòä
Thank you. We will be back.",4,2015,11,25
206,Mid week trip,"Stayed for two nights the middle of November. The staff were so helpful and went out of their way to make us feel at home. Rooms were very spacious, and the bedding so comfortable. the swimming pool area in the spa was really relaxing. This hotel is pretty new but they are doing a top job.",4,2015,11,24
206,Another Amazing Experience at The Marker Hotel,"I brought my mother for a fantastic birthday celebration to The Marker hotel on Friday night. We had a swim in the pool which is fantastic and like an underground cave perfect for relaxing and shutting off from the world. We had a beautiful meal, I was feeling adventurous and went for the wild boar for starters it was fantastic, we then had steak for our main it was cooked to perfection and the flavours were amazing. The staff were so friendly and helpful we were never with an empty glass. The Facilities of the hotel are fab and we relaxed on the rooftop bar taken in the breath taking views of the city. We finished up our night in the bar cosy beside the fire the athmosphere was buzzing. Breakfast the next morning was delicious and we were well fed and set up for the day. We would like to say a huge thank you to all the staff for making our stay amazing and a special thank you to the Head Chief Gareth Mullins for looking after us so well my mother had a fantastic birthday I don't know how I will top it next year :) .. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a night to remember.",5,2015,11,23
206,Fantastic as always,"Immaculate hotel, great staff. Location is dependant on where you want to be but perfect hotel. Staff are great and very helpful. Fifth time here with work and will certainly be back in work or leisure capacity. Spa facilities are also great.",5,2015,11,23
206,Weekend in Dublin,"We were in Dublin for the Greyhound Night of the Stars at Shelbourne Park which was just a few minutes walk from the hotel. This hotel is a gem and unusual for a modern hotel in that everything in the room was user friendly from the TV and lighting to the under floor heating in the bathroom which was well received on a cold and wet weekend. The breakfast buffet was very good and easy to navigate with everything to hand, while eggs, toast etc. were cooked fresh and served at the table.  The service level at this hotel is first class without the stuffiness you tend to encounter at the Shelbourne, Westbury or Four Seasons Hotels yet is reasonably priced all the same. There is a classy looking Spa and a pool which is as good as any you will find in a City Hotel. We did not use the rooftop bar due to the foul weather but it is obviously a big attraction to locals and tourists alike during the warmer months. Overall, we could not fault this hotel and it will definitely be our preferred choice on our occasional visits to Dublin. Peter & Linda. Birmingham",5,2015,11,23
206,The best hotel in Dublin,"Love this hotel. Go to Dublin every year for work and this is just the best hotel in the city. Love the location, the decor, the facilities and the staff! A refreshing addition to the collection of tired hotels in Dublin!",5,2015,11,23
206,Engagement on the rooftop ,"Here for an engagement. The staff were excellent in communication prior to arrival regarding engagement plans. Lovely touches, like staff walking past you in the corridor and stopping to ask you how your day is going adds a lovely warmth to be hotel. Very impressed with Cristina in reception, and the unimaginable service in the rooftop bar, particularly David and Derek and Graham. They made you feel like the president, whilst offering a good fun, jokey and entertaining service. All the staff in the rooftop bar were outstanding. I have over 300 likes and 200 comments on Facebook from the engagement post and am happy to have advertised the outstanding experience in the marker hotel. I will continue to be an ambassador for the marker. 

The quality of the cocktails is exceptional. They taste amazing, with literally 100 to choose from, and the staff are able to advise you on the right ones. They don't taste strong, but they obviously are as they certainly had quite a kick, which is good value for money. 

The spa is ultra modern with an intimate atmosphere. The rooms are ahead of their time, and the heated bathroom floor is a lovely novelty. Can't recommend the hotel enough. 

If you choose to get engaged here, it will be an evening you never forget. 

Much Gratitude

Mark and Claire",5,2015,11,22
206,Excellent location and service,"The location is excellent and within walking distance of many restaurants.  The area provides enjoyable walks.  I tried the spa while visiting and it was a very nice experience.  The relaxation areas could use a little work, but the staff was top notch.  The rooms have abundant space and offer alternate power connectors for travelers.  The bathrooms provide deep tubs for a soak with separate shower.  Room service offers quality food and selection.  I would recommend this hotel for business or pleasure.",4,2015,11,21
206,Lovely 5 star hotel,"stayed for a work conference recently. Fantastic facilities, good food, very sleek and comfortable bedrooms. Reminds me of hotels in Sweden or Denmark with the very sharp design. The pool area was an added bonus!!",4,2015,11,21
206,Awesome Service,"The staff make this hotel special, everyone from porters to receptionists was friendly and helpful.  Ambience is excellent, dim corridors set calm tone and rooms are well fitted, bathrooms are stunning with lots of marble and feature sinks.  Breakfast was really good quality.  Didn't visit spa but heard it was amazing.  Great location for Convention Centre.",5,2015,11,20
206,Too quality!,"Stayed for a week on business and it's hard to find fault with The Marker.

My room was large, quiet and very comfortable (the best hotel sleep for a long time!), 

Breakfast was a good buffet, with extra choices if you wanted. However, ‚Ç¨19.50 is
expensive for a bowl of cereal and a cup of coffee!

Every member of staff I spoke to was friendly, helpful and really gave the
Impression of 'caring'.

",5,2015,11,20
206,Amazing 5 Star Stay!,"I took my fianc√© for a romantic overnight stay last weekend to celebrate our engagement.  At time of booking I mentioned that I wanted special touches in the room. On arrival to the hotel we were greeted by very pleasant staff which created a great first impression. We got to our room which was very spacious and spotless clean, my fianc√© was so impressed and delighted with the petals on the bed and champagne in the room which I ordered. What a great start to a fabulous night at The Marker, truly an amazing hotel! Cannot wait to go back.",5,2015,11,19
206,How the mighty have fallen!,"I first started coming to Dublin three years ago on business and fell in love with this place. 

Great service, attention to detail and a warm and welcoming ambiance. I have stayed here 30 times and spent, I would estimate well over ‚Ç¨9,000 in the process. 

This evening however will be my last night here. Gone is the personal service that used to make me feel special and I have noticed this deterioration over the past 6 months. 

Just today, the wi-fi has been down most of the night - I am having to hotspot from my phone to write this review. I spent 30 minutes trying to get through to room service, and gave up and went to a local bar instead. When I returned for a nightcap, I spent 15 mins waiting to be served, whilst the barman seemed more intent on chatting to some bloke in front of me. Finally I get back to the room on the coldest day of the autumn so far, and despite having ramped up the heating, the room is like an icebox.

The hotel business is all about service; I should know I use them every week. When you neglect your loyal customers and forget about the basics, chasing the corporate dollar for conferences and gatherings to the detriment of your regulars, you are on a slippery slope to oblivion.

There are many other hotels in Dublin I have tried; the Herbert Part; which doesn't have the style, but which makes you feel wanted as a customer; the Merrion, pure opulance on a grand scale, even if it can be more expensive. Going forward I will use these establishments as an alternative.

It is with a heavy heart that I pen this review. This place used to be great, but is now just a pale shadow, an imitation of its former self.

They will still welcome their many guests, taken in by the amenities and glossy marketing, but I will no longer part with my cash to stay at an establishment that has lost its soul and which has forgotton what it is there for.",1,2015,11,19
206,high quality and very nice,"great location for attending a conference at the convention centre (but about a 15-20 walk into the centre of Dublin). Very tidy, modern and extremely comfortable (a superb bed!). We arrived early (too early to get into the room) but were able to shower and freshen up in the spa/gym showers (great after 30 hours of travel!). The corridors were a little dark - the is the only criticism I can think of!",5,2015,11,19
206,Great hotel with exceptional service,"Expected a nice business hotel and was pleasantly surprised because it was much nicer than most.  Room clean, large, comfortable, bathroom more luxurious than expected with separate shower and bath, location perfect.  Service was really exceptionally nice, easily on par with luxury hotels - staff are clearly highly trained.  Room service and food was nice, good quality and plentiful. Recommend their cronuts from the bar!  Will return.",5,2015,11,19
206,Best porridge ever!,"These guys take service seriously. From the restaurant to the rooms, they go the extra mile. Make sure and try the breakfast. A decadent porridge is a great way to kick off your day. 
Central to all the key amenities in Dublin but just at the edge of the tourist tramping zones. ",5,2015,11,19
206,Great,"Room with a view on the water, caring and helpful staff, friendly dinner at the brasserie and a big plus for the very big swimming pool. The spa facilities are amazing and definitely worth the stay. Location is perfect for business and only 15 minutes walk from downtown",5,2015,11,19
206,Successful work trip :-),"We held a small work conference over 2 days. Everything from the room to the service was fantastic. Highly recommend and would go back again. We also stayed here and the accommodation is wonderful. I love the dark corridors with the pools of light just over the doors! Also managed to use spa which was quiet, clean and super relaxing.",5,2015,11,18
206,Fantastic and Cool,I recently stayed at the Marker while attending a conference at the nearby CCD. Brilliant spacious and comfortable rooms Fantastic bathroom shower with Malin and Goetz products Fantastic breakfast options and fun rooftop bar! Helpful and upbeat staff I will definitely be back! Loved every minute!,5,2015,11,17
206,Amazing,"From the time we arrived in our taxi until the time we left, we could not have received better service. The hotel is centrally located, spacious (for Dublin) and modern. The quality of the furnishings, marble bathrooms, beds that you wish you could take home,  great breakfast... It's almost a destination hotel. A little on the pricey side but worth every penny. One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in.",5,2015,11,17
206,Phenomenal 5 star hotel,"We went to the Marker hotel with 3 couples to celebrate our 40th birthdays and we were not disappointed. It was raining when we got out of the taxi and the guy on the door come rushing over with a huge umbrella for my wife and her friend whilst he carried their luggage. When we checked in at 11:00 our rooms were ready and the girl on the check out even took us to the lift. We were in a standard room but this was lovely. Very spacious with a decent sized bathroom and a really comfortable bed. The spa area with amazing. Always a spare bed, got into the Jacuzzi easily which held at least 8 to 10 people,  huge swimming pool, a steam room and sauna. What more could you ask for. We came back to the hotel each night for a few drinks. The service in the bar at night was excellent especially Godfrey who served us on both evenings. Everything we ask for we got. They staff just didn't say no. Check out was also an good experience and they held our luggage until we returned to catch our flight. Taxi's were always booked for us but there were taxis directly outside anyway. A 15 minute walk from the town center but still in an excellent location with trendy eateries and pubs on your door step. Couldn't fault this hotel in anyway. You have to try the legendary 'cronut'.Would definitely stay again when I go back to Dublin. Thank you for a truly amazing experience.",5,2015,11,17
206,Great location and one of the best hotels in Dublin,"I love the architecture, the location and the place. I have just one complaint about the service, I think we were unfortunate that day because it wasn't my first time there and the service was always outstanding.
After the little incident, I just want to say that Mark at the brasserie was amazing! Just blew us away with his service tonight. He is a credit and the hotel is to be commended on someone like him on their team.",4,2015,11,15
206,Recent stay at The Marker,All round excellent service. Very friendly staff. Good value. Great location. Close to conference facilities. Did not get to see roof-top bar but hear it is great. Would stay again. Highly recommend for business or pleasure.,5,2015,11,15
206,Superb hotel and service is EXCELLENT,"The best hotel in Ireland I'd ever been...excellent location, brilliant service, and sumptuous meal ... i will definitely go back here :) The staff are very helpful and very courteous to us. Indoor pool is superb. My boyfriend told me it was a very good choice that I have chosen this hotel. We really had a nice time in the rooftop bar. It was a bit chilly but there is also a nice warm room in the rooftop that you can sit and still enjoy the view and the drinks.",5,2015,11,14
206,Excellent; 1st rate!!,"My wife and myself stayed at the Marker this past week.
Part business part pleasure.
The accommodations were excellent, the service, bellhops, front desk, bar, restaurant
staff all superb. Meeting rooms were great as was the food.
The rooms were clean and comfortable.
I would highly recommend the Marker Dublin !!",5,2015,11,14
206,Wedding night stay,"We stayed here for two nights and the service was incredible. I think when you pay extra money for a hotel, this is the level of service you expect to receive. The staff were very helpful but not over familiar and the room was very comfortable with a great view over Grand Canal Square.",5,2015,11,12
206,Fabulous Hotel,"This was our second time staying in ""The Marker Hotel"".  What can I say? We were met by Stephan who was extremely helpful and welcoming.  Check in was faultless, informative and courteous.  Our room wasn't ready as we were early so we had a light lunch was was very enjoyable in comfortable surroundings.

The room had everything we needed, nice mini bar, luxurious bathroom, spotless and comfortable bed, nice view of canal.  My husband answered a knock to our door to find a waiter with a bottle of wine and cup cake with welcome back in chocolate to 'Welcome' us back!! Much appreciated.

We were going to Michael Mc Intyre in the 3 Arena and had an easy 15 minute walk to the event. 

Our room was close to the elevator, but we didn't hear any noise and had a wonderful sleep.  We had breakfast in our room which was really good.  Didn't use the pool, Spa was fully booked; my mistake I should have pre-booked.

Thank you to Stephan and all his staff for a wonderful experience.  We look forward to our return and will recommend to family and friends.",5,2015,11,11
206,excellent hotel,My husband and Istayed in this hotel last Friday night An absolutely great experience in every way .The room was stunning and the bed linens pillows etc luxurious.The staff all round the hotel were so friendly and beautifully mannered. Avery special  thank you to Catriona who looked after us so well.It was a real treat to stay at The Marker Already looking  forward to going back .couldnt say one negative  thing about The Marker,5,2015,11,11
206,Excellent hotel,From the moment we arrived at the hotel our stay was perfect. The staff at reception were so friendly and extremely helpful.  When we checked in we were told that our room had been upgraded to a corner suite....even more luxurious.  The room was fabulous and spotlessly clean.   The bar was lively when we got back to the hotel that night and the cocktails were too good!  Breakfast was excellent with a huge choice on the menu.  We will definitely be back.,5,2015,11,09
206,Makes my top ten list,"Being a traveler all my life I have experienced hotel stays in over 35 countries.The Marker is easily a top ten one together with Cubo in Slovenia and Square9 in Belgrade.
It combines design elements that make it unique with excellent service,an unbeatable breakfast quality and a unique mini bar which is in fact a closet in the wall revealing all kinds of edible goodies once discovered( It took me a full day to find it,by accident)
All in all an excellent choice but on the expensive side.",5,2015,11,09
206,Absolutely stunning Hotel,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay here on a Saturday night. We had tickets for a show in the 3Arena. We booked based on the reviews online & the proximity to arena which was a comfortable 15 minute walk. There were taxis outside but it was a lovely evening & plenty of others strolling along towards the point village. On arrival check in was most welcoming with friendly professional staff that appeared to enjoy their job, something that's hard to find in other hotels we've stayed in where staff are under pressure, rushed & guests feel like an inconvenience. The marker is nothing like that. It's red carpet, polite mannerisms & nothing is too much for anyone. The room we booked was a deluxe. Very Roomy, luxurious & faced the canal/docks of Dublin. It wasn't breathtaking but pleasant. We had our dinner from the bar food menu in a comfortable area with lots of seating, beautiful fire setting surrounded by the modern architecture that is the Marker with the outside of the hotel flowing through the inside. I had rib-eye steak. It was mouth watering. My husband a mammoth burger followed by well priced desserts. Drinks were very expensive but we expected this & throughly enjoyed our pre theatre dinner. Following the show we returned to the hotel to discover the rooftop bar was closing (11pm) we were disappointed but it will be a prefect excuse for us to book again for the rooftop bar & Spa which I believe are stunning. Our night was very comfortable, the room completely dark with heavy blackout curtains. This quietest hotel stay we've ever experienced and we both slept very well. We enjoyed a full hearty breakfast the following morning at 10:30. The atmosphere again very welcoming & relaxed. After check out our car was brought to the door for us and 2 complimentary bottles of water for our journey home. 
 Thank you to everyone  at the Marker for a wonderful, luxurious stay. We will certainly return.  ",5,2015,11,09
206,Great Hotel,We stayed 2 nights in this centrally located hotel. Amazing position for seeing Dublin with friendly & helpful staff. who went out of their way to assist us. Lovely buffet breakfast & amazing roof top bar. Only down side was that my 12yr old son was only allowed in pool at certain times.,5,2015,11,09
206,Very pleasant stay,"Stayed two nights at the Marker Hotel at the start of my Irish vacation and I was not disappointed. A rather new hotel in the Docklands area of the city, the Marker is conveniently located near the convention center and is but a few blocks from the River Liffey. It is about a 15-20 minute walk to Dublin center, but don't let that deter you.

On arrival after a red eye flight, I was pleasantly surprised to be able to check right in to my room in the nine o'clock hour--a full six hours early!

Room was big enough--though by no means huge. Bed was comfortable, bathroom was well-appointed with black marble and separate soaking tub and shower. Rooms are well insulated from noise and I couldn't hear anything from neighboring rooms or the nearby lifts.

Full Irish breakfast was excellent. I cannot comment on the other meal offerings, the bar, or the pool/spa as I did not have time to avail myself of these amenities. All staff were professional and helpful.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this hotel. Is it a 5-star luxury experience? Not sure if I've ever encountered that in my travels, but then again I don't spend thousands a night on a hotel. For the price, I'd rate the Marker Hotel as excellent and would stay there again in the future.",5,2015,11,09
206,Stunning place to stay .. perfect ...,"Stunning place to visit, stunning place to be lucky enough to stay ... it has the wow factor from first glimpse .. I can not write enough about this hotel .. I want to live here :) fantastic rooms/suites .. bespoke.. breath taking views.. separate living and sleeping areas .. bathroom was just beautiful .. This hotel has it all whether staying over or popping in for an event or few drinks..  I need to go back right now :) Unfortunately we just stayed one night, arrived in the late afternoon and had an early morning check out... Next time I would love to stay for a weekend ... Well done to all the staff for making our visit one to remember for the right reasons..",5,2015,11,08
206,Absolutely fabulous!,Stayed here at the weekend for one night and couldn't find one fault with it. We were upgraded to a corner suite and the room was just beautiful. Couldn't hear any outside noise and you wouldn't even know you were near a busy road. Staff were all extremely helpful and friendly. Food and cocktails gorgeous! Would definitely recommend it and I am looking forward to staying here again in the future.,5,2015,11,08
206,Perfect hotel in Dublin,"A new and perfect hotel with a very kind staff. Lovely swimmingpool and spa. Close to the city centre. The room and bathroom was very spacious and luxury. The airport is relativily close by. We will certainly come back.
One little minor thing; there was no soap holder in the shower.",5,2015,11,08
206,Beautiful property--a bit of a hike to City Center,"This hotel is brand new, and it certainly shows. The room and marble bathroom were super spacious and very nicely decorated. Really tasty in room coffee and tea as well. 

If you stay here definitely take advantage of the pool/spa area on the second floor, which is gorgeous. I spent an afternoon reading there and relaxing in the sauna. The spa menu is on the expensive side, so I didn't indulge, but probably would have if there was some kind of promotion specifically for hotel guests.

The only issue with this hotel is that it is a bit of a hike to city center. I walked it, but it takes about 30 minutes (with traffic) to get to the Temple Bar area. It is also pretty tough to find food in this area after about 7 p.m, as most of the cafes are only open for breakfast and lunch. If you want a light bite to eat late at night good luck. My husband and I arrived back at the hotel late on our anniversary and ended up eating convenience store sandwiches.",4,2015,11,06
206,this is a perfect hotel,"The marker Hotel is a perfect stay in terms of service staff and facilities. The location is supper. The hotel is minutes from the convention center , 15 minutes from Tmple Bar area and convenius distance from DUB Intnl airport .  I'd highly recomand this nice hotel",5,2015,11,06
206,Really one of the best,"A big congrats to the team of the Marker. Every single service / product was an above expected experience. As I travel frequently, this hotel is definitely a must when you are staying in Dublin. Congratulations to the whole team",5,2015,11,06
206,Very Good Stay,"I had a very good stay at the Marker Hotel. Nice service, great room.  All very clean.  Most important very comfortable bed, so I had a powerful sleep.  Location of the hotel is amazing as just few min walk from place I had to be. Great area for a walk.",4,2015,11,05
206,Excellent Hotel,"We stay in this hotel regularly and  customer service is excellent. The hotel has everything that you would expect from a 5* but with the friendliness and genuine welcome that is often missing in other hotels. We travel practically every week and thus  stay in hotels all over the world. However we can honestly say that The Marker is probably our favourite hotel both for Business and Leisure,",5,2015,11,05
206,"The Marker, Dublin ; Always superior","Consistently excellent staff, personal service and old style attention to detail that is missing from so many contemporary hotels defines the Marker. Professionalism, comfort, efficiency, cleanliness and good will is in abundance for every guest in every encounter with all staff. Every time I stay, there is another personal touch- whether it's birthday cake, or a room upgrade - my companions and I are always impressed. Plenty for other Dublin hotels to learn from!!! Thanks guys.",5,2015,11,05

206,Great hotel in a great location,"Great hotel near many of the tech companies (Google, FB, etc) 

Trendy place with a lively lobby with decent food.

Smaller than hoped for gym and pool. I am big into fitness and am upset when a 5 star hotel advertises fitness/pool and doesn't really deliver on my expectations.

Great rooms and service",4,2015,11,02
206,Luxury in the heart of Dublin,"This hotel has huge relaxing bedrooms, with very comfortable beds, gorgeous big bathroom. The staff are super friendly. Very close to the city centre. Beautiful views from their roof terrace. Amazing food.",5,2015,11,02
206,"Fabulous stay, short walk to tram and bus","My husband and I stayed here for a week to attend a conference and to do some sightseeing.   The location was great as you're only a 5 minute walk to the Convention Center across the Samuel Beckett bridge.  Also, there is a Luas tram stop (Spencer Dock on the Red Line) behind the Convention Center which gets you all around town.  Also the hotel is an easy walk to 2 of the Green Bus Sightseeing Stops and the Aircoach bus which goes to the airport every hour.

Everything about the hotel is wonderful.  The service when you check in, the room, the food/drink and wait staff at the lobby restaurant and rooftop bar, as well as Robert the concierge who helped me plan/book a couple of day trips.  I'd love to go back to The Marker!",5,2015,11,01
206,The Market - Dublin,"The rooms are very comfortable, the bathroom has a floor warmer which is great in the cold, the river Liffey is across the road and provides a great view. For me it was very conveniently located across my workplace and though the stay was very short, it made it easy to avoid getting wet in the showers",5,2015,11,01
206,Beautiful Hotel,This hotel is in the heart of Dublin in a beautiful setting surrounded by lovely resuaurants and beside a theatre. There is a roof-top bar which serves some delicious cocktails.

206,"convenient location, big rooms","second time I've stayed here and a little more positive this time.  Perhaps its me, perhaps its the hotel maturing and getting more experience.  I still struggle with the fact I can't open a window and the airconditioning is too loud to leave on...despite that, the large rooms and the great location makes it a good option.",4,2015,10,30

Another plus is the lovely area surrounding the hotel on the water.  Over all my favorite
hotel in Dublin.",5,2015,10,29
206,Absolutely fabulous hotel‚ù§Ô∏è,"From the moment you arrive at the hotel in your car, it is 5 Star all the way. They make you feel so special and so welcome. We had our two children with us in a connecting room and they were treated so well. Even had little cookies and sweets ready for them on arrival. Fabulist rooms, really soundproofed and fabulous food. Be sure to try the rooftop bar as it's such a beautiful view and the staff are just lovely. Overall, a wonderful stay and would highly recommend if you are looking for a little luxury in Dublin. ",5,2015,10,28
206,Fantastic hotel,"Travelling with family (including two young-ish kids), we found this hotel to be new, clean and well-situated for a trip to Dublin (so far so normal at those prices...); however, it was the exceptional service and attention of the staff that we found most impressive.  Whether in the restaurant or the main hotel, nothing was too much trouble and it was clear to us that the staff are well trained and motivated, super helpful and friendly.  Also, for those who like swimming pools and spas-this hotel has a super special pool and the spa looked cool!",5,2015,10,28
206,An Upclass Place at a Good Price,"We picked The Marker from a list of hotels on TripAdvisor and found it to be everything and more that was mentioned in the rankings and reviews.  This is a beautiful hotel located along the waterfront section of Dublin.  It offers all the amenities of a 5 star hotel and is conveniently located near public transportation and tour buses.  The staff is remarkable, especially the housekeeping folks who were not only excellent at their job but also friendly.  It is worth pampering yourself in this beautiful hotel.",5,2015,10,28
206,Luxury at a great location,"The Marker is a fabulous hotel.  Whilst it is outside of the main tourist hub of Dublin, it boasts nearby transport links via the Luas and Dart to keep you within minutes of all of the main areas.   Situated in the business area, it's also surrounded by buzzing cafes and restaurants as well as the Bord Gais theatre (where you'll see many of the top touring shows). The rooms are bright, modern and superbly comfortable.  Staff friendly and only too happy to help.  The pictures of the hotel speak for themselves!",5,2015,10,28
206,Modern and a great location,"A very cool and modern hotel. Very lively residents bar into the small hours (which I find hard to come across in many hotels). Rooms were very modern, good size tv, and a heated floor in the bathroom with a large shower!

Valet parking was very handy and cheaper than the adjacent Q-Park. (Make sure you pre book).

Wish I had time to try out the spa but would certainly return!",4,2015,10,27
206,The Marker - Great Experience,"A brilliant experience overall from start to finish. Couldn't fault anything about hotel except drinks was expensive.  My treat is champagne which was 15.40 per glass (sorry can't remember the name), my husband had a Midleton rare whiskey priced approx. 20 euros. Excellent quality.  Overall a wonderful night had by all including my two teenagers boys.",5,2015,10,27
206,A quality hotel with great service and friendly staff,"My wife and I stayed for a few nights as a weekend get away. The hotel is one of the best hotels we have stayed in, with nicely decorated rooms, facilities and furnishings. The staff cannot do enough for you and are very friendly and this underpins the great service that they offer. I would happily stay at the Marker again and look forward to the next opportunity to stay again.",5,2015,10,26
206,"Modern design hotel, high class service","A warm welcome was given when we arrived late on a Bank Holiday weekend. Room 513 offers a spacious bathroom, a heavenly bed, enough space for luggage and clothing. We could not hear a single sound coming from the hallway, our room neighbors or the surroundings. Service was exceptional friendly.
",5,2015,10,26
206,No surprises,"As a business traveler, location is one of the most important aspects of a hotel.  The marker is very well located near the convention center and a lot of offices.  The area must be one of the posh areas in Dublin.
The reception is exceptionally good and personal : a plate with a cake and fruit in your room and a personal card with your name.
The room is not particularly large but good enough if you need to spend some time there for working.
The desk has a UK and European electricity plug.  Very convenient is that the desk light comes with an integrated iphone connector for charging.  No need to unload your chargers.  However, easy to forget when you leave the room.
The wifi is free of charge and no hassle with passwords.  There is a safebox in the room as well as the material for ironing.
You can make yourself a cup with some instant coffee but this is a bit outdated these days.  many hotels provide a nespresso machine or equivalent.  While we are at it, some other points for improvement : limited space in the wardrobe and an unfortunate choice of the telephone connection.  One side of the bed has all the switches for the lights, while the other side only has one switch for that side of the bed.  The latter is where you can find the telephone.  So either you sleep on the side where you can switch all the lights on/off but have to jump out of the bed when your telephone rings or the other way around.
There are rooms with a shower and rooms with a bath.  Depending on whether you are a bath- or shower person, you may want to ask when booking.
The breakfast is extensive but not exclusive and quite monotonous if you stay there for a longer period.  Scrumbled egg, bacon, sausage, potatoes on the warm side.  A limited choice of bread, cheese and meat.  2 types of sweet danish pastries,  Yoghurt and fresh fruit.
To end on the most positive note of my stay : the personnel is extremely friendly and helpful !",4,2015,10,26
206,Excellence in the new heart of Dublin,"Impeccably attentive staff, the brasserie for dinner, breakfast, rooms, services, all is managed in a very professional and accurate way. I stayed there for eight nights and every day (at anytime) I was welcomed with a smile. Room service is also up to standards. Rooms are quiet, well clean, with comfortable beds and good bathroom amenities. A true five star hotel. Compliments to all those who work there.",5,2015,10,25
206,Great stay in a great city,"The hotel was fantastic. The breakfast was amazing, the rooms were brilliant - we had connecting room for the children. The only issue with the stay is that the children are only allowed at the pool during certain hours of the day. These did not really fit our day well and it was very dissapointing. We only found out about these rooms after we arrived at the hotel!",4,2015,10,25
206,THE hip hotel in Dublin,This hotel  can truly be called hip. Outside and inside appearance is state of the art. Staff is very friendly and help you whenever they can.(We wanted to visit the roof terrace although closed - they made it possible. The location in the Dublin¬¥s dockland area corresponds with the cutting edge style of this hotel.,5,2015,10,23
206,excellence in service and food,very nice and modern hotel. Excellent food and the service is to a very high standard. Bedroom was very clean and fresh and the infinity pool is a nice touch Close to the city center and walking was not a problem.,5,2015,10,23
206,Use the Spa,"Very comfortable place - attentive service, nice amenities.   Do NOT miss out on the pool and spa.  The room was very spacious and I slept pretty well - but I found the large, over-stuffed pillows to be quite uncomfortable. Don't forget about the spa.",5,2015,10,21
206,Typical of what you'd expect of a luxury hotel in a European city,"The hotel was excellent, staff kind, and ambiance good.  There was nothing special, but it was clearly a luxury hotel and had everything you'd expect from one.  Tip: if you check in late, and the hotel is booked, they will upgrade you to a suite if it's the last room left.  I got lucky with that.",4,2015,10,21
206,Mini Break,"We stayed three nights at this fabulous hotel. Throughout our stay we were impressed with the very excellent staff, who were so friendly, helpful and very professional, The room was spacious, modern and super comfortable. with a large bathroom with bath and walk-in shower. I used the spa pool every day, the atmosphere is very relaxing, with low lights and soft music.  The breakfast is self service with an excellent choice of both continental and cooked foods. The reception and lounge bar areas are quite busy with a good vibe in the early evening, with people enjoying after work or pre theatre drinks.  The hotel's architecture is quite striking and faces into a modern central square,  shared with other large buildings like the Bord gais Energy Theatre which  is in the Grand Canal Quays area, it is about a 30 minute walk into Dublin centre from the hotel.  However there are buses to the centre which run quite close to the hotel.  Would have liked to have tried the roof top bar area, but it was closed during our stay. Excellent stay, excellent hotel.",5,2015,10,20
206,Loved it!,"Spend 3 nights for a business trip at The Marker and really loved this hotel. The interior at the front desk is an architectural masterpiece and the rooms are large, well decorate and equipped with every convenience. You should visit the Spa & Welness, loved the lifefitness, sauna and swimmingpool.",5,2015,10,18
206,Overall great stay,"Was very happy with my stay, the staff is very friendly, its a bit of a walk to Dublin downtown but I nice sceanic walk down the waterway. There is a rooftop bar that everyone talk about and the spa and pool are supposed to be amazing but unfortunately was to busy to visit either.  Overall great stay and very professional staff.   The restaurants by the hotel are targeted more towards foreigners so you are going to get more expensive mediocre food but overall the room is clean, free WiFi and they even have 1 us outlet if you forget your convertor.  ",5,2015,10,18
206,All Great Experience,"My parents stayed in The Marker recently and here is their review
""From the moment we arrived we felt at home.  This was very important as we belong to the over 60s brigade!!!!  Our beautiful room, the lovely food, the welcoming ambiance and the professionalism of hotel the staff were all first class. A special mention to Lillie who treated us like royalty and made sure our stay was perfect.  Thank you so much.
We will definitely be back and highly recommend this hotel""",5,2015,10,17
206,Real treat!,"Hi we stayed in The Marker as part of a birthday celebrations and really enjoyed The Marker experience‚Ä¶We had a room over looking the Bord gais Energy Theatre and it was lovely watching the comings and goings whilst at the same time not hearing a sound from the streets below. From checkin , by the most friendly and helpful reception staff we have ever come across to breakfast in the room, which was a real treat, to dinner, then drinks on the rooftop, it was a fantastic stay‚Ä¶. Can't wait to return soon!",5,2015,10,15
206,Excellent,"First class product. As others have observed, from the moment we arrived, the service was excellent. Luggage taken, car whisked away, and in a lovely room in no time, with great views. The swimming pool and leisure area was delightful, though quibbles would be that a few more towels would be nice, as would more loungers. Mrs Bealbhocht was going to the theatre, and had an excellent supper in the bar. I was going to a dinner there, and unusually for such a function, the food was absolutely superb.  On the Bealbhocht star scale - 4.7 stars - outstanding for a newish place.",5,2015,10,14
206,Modern clean 5 * hotel in Dublin,"I really love this hotel in Dublin. We stayed there for 3 nights and got a free room upgrade. It is modern and sophisticated with nice rooftop patio. Good quiet location by the water and grocery store. Everything is perfect for the hotel and make sure you ask for an upgrade if they don't offer you. It is best to get the room facing the water and you can even see sunset in the room.

My other favourite part of the hotel is their pool and sauna. Pool temperature is so warm and comfortable. They have adult only hour for the pool. If you have a quiet relaxing time to yourself you can go during those hour and late before the closing of the pool.",5,2015,10,14
206,Decent Hotel,"We stayed here for one nice.  Very friendly staff at check-in and willing to help you get to your room!  The room is nice, but nothing amazing. They are fairly sizeable though which is a nice feature.  A bit too far away from the city Center so takes about 30 minute walk into the city center.",4,2015,10,14
206,Lovely stay,"Stayed here with my friend for my birthday. Hotel is lovely. Rooms were clean and tidy, lovely big bathroom with separate bath and shower. Tea and coffee facilities in room. Hotel has free Wi-Fi. We used the spa facilities and they are defiantly not to be missed. The hotel has a roof top bar and we enjoyed relaxing and admiring the view, they even supply blankets when it gets chillier on the evening. 

The theatre is just across and it takes about 20 minutes to walk to the city centre. There are a number of restaurants and bars around the area. 

We have a wonderful stay thank you!",4,2015,10,14
206,Dublin stay,"Fantastic hotel! Brilliant staff, excellent service!   A really top hotel in the up and coming east side of Dublin's financial district.  The spa is fantastic and well worth the visit alone!  Excellent spacious room, with a good view out onto the canal.",5,2015,10,14
206,Peaceful and bliss,"From start to finish the whole experience was just perfect! From the bellhop collecting you bags there was no need to lift a finger the whole stay. The large rooms and AMAZING bathrooms were exactly what was needed for a relaxing break. The spa may be a bit pricey but well worth it, mango sorbet and freshly squeezed orange juice waiting for you when you get out. 10 minute walk to Grafton street too All in all I give 5 stars.",4,2015,10,14
206,Wonderful Experience,We stayed at the Marker for business purposes.  The hotel was wonderful - rooms were spacious and immaculate. The staff was friendly and helpful to our every need. THe location was perfect area to get around on foot or by local bus or taxi service. Thank you.,5,2015,10,12
206,Absolutely Fanbloodytastic!,"5 Star from start to finish with a genuine warm greeting from the staff including the lovely valet, lady on reception and all bar and restaurant staff. I did not meet one unfriendly staff member for the one night duration of my stay. 100% recommend this over other Dublin 5 Stars I have stayed in. We had a lovely deluxe room with a very comfy bed and lovely bathroom and bathroom supplies. My husband used the pool and said it was lovely. We had afternoon coffees and drinks in the ground level bar and the man that looked after us was a credit to the hotel. Unfortunately I did not get his name. Cocktails before dinner in the rooftop bar were a delight. Breakfast delicious the following morning and the lovely touch of two bottles of water in the car when it was brought around was a very nice final touch. I will certainly be returning for business or pleasure. In fact I said to my husband I will never stay anywhere else in Dublin again! It was the staff that made it for me. Well done everyone. Keep up the good work!",5,2015,10,12
206,Worthy of 5 stars," Difficult to fault, we really enjoyed our stay here. A modern hotel 15 minute walk from O'Connell bridge on the South Bank. Next to new Bord Glais Theatre. Great hotel, excellent service, very comfortable and very clean. Large rooms with large bathrooms with a bath and shower",5,2015,10,10
206,Beautifully appointed,"A very nice hotel - situated perfectly for short or long walks (e.g. Trinity College 10 minutes).  The exceptionally professional staff were phenomenal throughout my stay.

Be sure to make use of the spa whilst there...excellent steam and dry saunas.

The area surrounding the hotel is a bit dull (lots of luxury condos - all the dodgy old brick buildings are, sadly, gone).  Head westward for more interesting sights and sounds. ",4,2015,10,08
206,"Great location, comfortness, ambience and staff!","Perhaps the best hotel in Dublin with an absolutely great service from all of its staff. They GYM may be kind of small and the room decor a bit too pop for my liking... but other than that, the comfortness of the room is perfect, the food very tasty (great breakfast) and the people very very nice. Well done for making it happen one more",5,2015,10,07
206,Excellent Hotel with wonderful staff,"Stayed here for 3 nights in Sept 2015. The room was larger than most hotel standards and an excellent bathroom with a good sized walk in shower and a big bath for relaxing in at the end of a busy day. The staff were super friendly and professional. I would recommend the rooftop bar for a bite to eat and a great view of the river.Walking distance to the conference centre and only 20 minutes to the airport (traffic dependent) Taxi in to the centre of dublin around 15 minutes and 7 Euros, so very easy to get about.",5,2015,10,07
206,Disappointing Honeymoon Stopover,"We were so looking forward to staying here before we left for our honeymoon but at ‚Ç¨250 p/n with no breakfast, we were sorely disappointed! The rooms were modern & clean but nothing special and the staff were good but not 5*. We had a group booking in the rooftop area and although the food & view were good, the staff were rude to a number of our guests. Our room
wasn't ready when we arrived at 3pm and their 'courtesy car' also wasn't available for the duration of our stay. If you want a real 5* experience, don't stay here!",4,2015,10,06
206,"New, modern, elegant but no Irish charm","If you like modern amenities, large rooms, western type hotels; this is it. I loved my stay at the Marker. But I would have preferred a more boutique type hotel in Dublin with more of the personal Irish charm.",5,2015,10,05
206,Great Service,"As a Dublin native, I go to the Marker Hotel quite often. The hotel has excellent design is placed in the 'silicon quay' of Dublin in the up and coming development area and the Google headquarters neighborhood. The Marker hotel Spa and Wellness is an experience all in its own and I highly recommend the Weekender package. One of the best massages I ever got was there and I go quite often to spas around the world. The Restaurant offers innovative dining with amazing cocktails and if you are on a budget the Sunday Le Drunch from 2 to 5pm offers cheaper choices. 
The rooms are amazing. It really is worth the price.",5,2015,10,04
206,Excellent Hotel,"We started our 10 day trek to Ireland at this hotel-it was a great way to start. The hotel is lovely, good is good, and the Lomi Lomi message is excellent! The only drawback is that since it is in the business district, most nearby restaurants are closed. Not to worry though, there is the HQ across the street and a grocery nearby.",5,2015,10,03
206,Amazing from start to finish,"The Marker exceeded my expectation from the time I arrived (very early) to the end of my trip. Their management are doing everything right, from hiring the best people to establishing a service culture that is rare to find these days.  I would highly recommend The Marker to anyone wanting a great stay in Dublin.",5,2015,10,02
206,Too warm!,"Great staff, great food, great service, but with warm weather, the rooms were so warm that I couldn't sleep.  I mentioned this to the desk as I left the first morning who promised to check on it next day, but I returned next day with no resolution.  They brought a fan that had to be filled with ice???  But that was not much help that night.  They promised to take care of it the next day.  I returned to no change.  If this hotel is trying to be luxurious, that doesn't happen if the air conditioning does not work.  I couldn't take a shower or blow dry my hair without having a heat stroke.  Never would stay here again unless they fix this!",3,2015,10,01
206,Exceeds expectation ,"Every thing excellent. The best of the best are the staff. 
The whole staff were friendly,  polite and makes you happy all the time. They make my trip to Ireland one of the best trips in my life. If I visited Ireland again I will definitely stay at the Marker hotel. ",5,2015,09,30
206,The Marker Hotel,"We stayed at The Marker Hotel in Dublin this weekend. It was a lovely hotel with amazing service. The staff was always there to help us find great restaurants. The Roof top bar was exceptional. The rooms were spacey, extremely comfortable and clean. It was 15 minute walk to Temple Bar along the river.  I would highly recommend this hotel !",5,2015,09,30
206,"Excellent modern rooms, good location and fantastic roof top cocktail bar","We stayed at the Marker in July 2014 and I have visited the roof top cocktail bar on 4 occasions since and I think its one of Dublin ""hidden gems"". The rooms are really nice, modern and classy finishes. Bathrooms are excellent standard. The staff are very polished and professional and the ""Piece Du Resistence"" is the truly fantastic roof top cocktail bar. On a summer's evening it is ""to die for"". Excellent location for the Grand Canal / Bord Gais theatre. Robert and Tracy, Dublin Ireland",5,2015,09,29
206,"Incredible Service, Beautiful Modern Hotel, Perfect Location if your focus is the Tech Sector, Interesting Architecture","I spend a lot of time in this beautiful hotel in the heart of Silicon Docks. I'm a business software veteran who was one of the earliest employees in one of the most successful software companies in the world today. I always have important meetings here. The reason for that is the friendly and efficient service. In my experience it is incomparable to any other hotel in Dublin. If you want a perfectly located hotel where service is excellent, you can meet senior people from the tech sector in Ireland (most of them are located within 1 kilometer of the Marker). That of course also applies to Irish people meeting important clients from abroad. An additional tip is to seek out a guy simply known as Dev in there to look after you. He is incredibly attentive (even by the hotel's high standards) and will look after your clients/prospects extremely well. The Marker also has a view from it's roof bar that rivals the view from the Gravity Bar in the Guinness Storehouse. These are the 2 best elevated views of Dublin. And the Marker looks out on the Grand canal and the impressive Grand Canal (Bord Gais) theatre built by starchitect Daniel Libeskind. Just around the corner you have another starchitect's work - Santiago Calatrava's bridge. And across the water in the iconic Convention Centre (an impressive giant glass barrel in a concrete box by architect Kevin Roche). I'm into architecture. Dublin ranks lowly in Europe for architecture, but the Silicon Docks is the one outstanding exception when it comes to modern architecture. I wouldn't call it a romantic hotel (it's more sleek, clean modern lines than romance), but it's the pinnacle in terms of business hotels in Dublin. This is the only major hotel located right in the centre of Dublin's Silicon Docks - and Dublin sells more software than any other city in the world. Most of that software is sold from a 1KM radius of here. I've recommended this hotel to many visiting friends and business connections - and have always been thanked for the recommendation. 3 of my business contacts visiting Dublin for the first time praised the place so highly today I was moved to write this recommendation.",5,2015,09,28
206,Luxurious hotel well worth a visit,"This was one of the most fantastic hotels that I have ever stayed in, and from somebody that has travelled a lot with work and personal, that is a lot to compare it to.  From the fantastic and fast checkout, to the beautiful spacious rooms, with a large bathroom, separate shower, and bath, extremely modern.  Brilliant location in the heart of the newly built docklands, very quiet.  It is not central, so about a 20 minute walk into the central of Dublin, however taxis are cheap here and is only around an 8EURO cabride into the CBD.  The highlight would have to be the magnificient spa area, with relaxation pool, spa bath, sauna, steamroom and relaxation area.  We had breakfast once at the hotel, the buffet was ok, I wouldn't say it was worth the 24EURO they were charging but it wasn't bad either.  If open, definitely checkout the rooftop bar as well, fabulously decorated, brilliant view, plus great little tapas dishes to top it off.  If this hotel was in a city that was more lively with more things to do and see, I would definitely make a repeat visit.  Be aware though it is a 5 Star hotel, but definitely worth the price.",5,2015,09,28
206,Great modern hotel,Clean and spacious - wife complained about no decent mirror in the dressing area. Excellent location and great breakfast.  Rooms very modern but comfortable with a large and stylish bathroom.  Unfortunately it was raining so didn't experience the roof top bar.  Staff very pleasant and accommodating.,4,2015,09,28
206,The Marker Hotel Experience,Excellent hotel. Brilliant staff and superb location. We stayed for the weekend as part of my wife's 40th Birthday celebrations. Staff made us very welcome and the hotel went the extra mile to make the occasion extra special for us. I could not fault the Marker Hotel - 5 Stars all the way!,5,2015,09,28
206,The Marker Hotel Dublin,"The hotel was beautiful - it is based on the abstract idea of ""caves"".  We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel.  They have a really nice breakfast buffet, but it is a bit pricey and not included in the cost of the stay.  Recommend that hotel guests check local restaurants in the area for breakfast - it can be half the cost.  I felt that there was too much pressure upon check in to sell us a higher priced room with a view, sell us the breakfast buffet and bus tour.  We were told that there were only so many rooms with Expedia that got the nice view.",5,2015,09,28
206,Great!,"Fast Check-In & check out, always friendly staff, very clean and large stylish rooms. The fitness center was also very good and the hotel location is also very nice. We will come back to The Marker if we one come back to Dublin. If you do not need the big breakfast we recommend to go to the supermarket/ bakery 50 meters away - they made fresh and very tasty sandwiches, muffins etc. ",5,2015,09,26
206,Honeymoon overnighter,"We recently stayed in the Marker for one night prior to departing from Dublin for our honeymoon. The service we received and the quality of the hotel was outstanding.

Nothing was too much trouble for them and it really marked a great start to our honeymoon.

Fantastic experience :)",5,2015,09,26
206,One day in Dublin,I have been recently in this hire which is located in a new are close to the sea. The area is nice. The hotel is a modern building close to the river. The rooms are large and comfortable. Wifi connection is good. All the people of the hotel is quite kind and efficient. ,5,2015,09,26
206,wonderful experience,"We chose The Marker, as a treat for our 10th wedding anniversary. On arrival we were treated very well, reception gave good advise on where to visit, and also to be careful of our belongings in the temple bar area. We were advised that we had a room with a view, and boy, we got it!!!! The corridor was fab!! Room was very clean, spacious, the bedding was lovely, and the bed was so comfy. Everything that you needed was in the room. We used the pool, three times on our 3 day visit, we went at different times, and again, very clean, and nice and quiet, nobody bothering anybody. The pool is beautiful. A must visit is the Rooftop bar, again we went there three times, each time sampling a different cocktail!! Very friendly staff there too. A huge highlight was the slices of cake for our anniversary, and ofcourse the bed getting decorated.  Its about a 15minute walk into town, but that didn't bother us.",5,2015,09,25
206,Happening hotel for the younger generation.,"Located at the up and coming Docklands area of Dublin, I can see why this trendy hotel is rated highly. It's chic and sleek interior is architecturally iconic. I saw mostly younger people in the lobby. I would give it a 5-star rating for the amazing service I received during my stay here, however, the ambience in the hotel is too busy I feel like I'm in a departure area of an airport. The flow in the common spaces on the first floor is not up to a 5-star this hotel is supposedly rated. I was talking to a concierge when I overheard a couple complaining loudly to another concierge. It was troubling since the situation was not handled well and it went on and on. 
Our room was very large with views of the the Bord Gais Energy Theater. The bones in the room and the bathroom are high quality but by gosh, the sheets and the wall art pieces were average it looked like the interior designer quitted before he can complete his contract.",4,2015,09,24
206,Wonderful 5 Star,"This is an exquisite 5 star hotel in the heart of Dublin's newest district. I remember when it was just factories and empty space but now it's almost Dublin's answer to Canary Wharf,. The service in the bar and brasserie in the hotel is second to none. Whilst the staff in the Spa are so accommodating. Delightful swimming pool with not too many people in it. All in all a great place to stay and spend time.",5,2015,09,23
206,Wonderful stay at a wonderful hotel!,"Just returned from an amazing trip to Ireland.  Our first week was in Dublin and we stayed at the Marker Hotel.  From the moment we arrived until we had to leave, the staff at the hotel did everything they could to make our stay perfect.  Voltan greeted us when we arrived, got us checked in and took care of our luggage.  Every time we ran into him after that he would ask if there was anything we needed.  Robert handled finding another tour for us when the one we had scheduled was cancelled at the last minute.  Frederico literally ran down the block to chase down a cab for us.  Chris, Dev and Godfrey made sure we were taken care of in the bar.  I think it was Claire who made up a list of phrases in Gaelic so we could try to speak the language while we were there.  Helen made sure our room was take care of every day.  The hotel itself is beautiful.  The rooms are spacious and well equipped.  The location is great, right next to the Borgese Energy Theater.  The staff is what makes this hotel outstanding!",5,2015,09,21
206,Holiday in Ireland,Started our Ireland trip in Dublin staying at the Marker. The service was beyond anything I could have imagined. They knew what we needed before we had a chance to ask. Everyone was friendly from the front staff all the way down to the housekeepers. I would highly highly recommend this location. Thank you for the 5 Star treatment,5,2015,09,21
206,Marker Hotel Dublin,"Outstanding service especially the Concierge Services and the Restaurant Wait Staff. Disappointed in the room that did not have properly working air conditioning, eventually we were offered another room which met our expectations. Issue was not corrected until I asked for the GM.",4,2015,09,21
206,Marker,I have traveled many places. The Marker stay was first class in all aspects. All staff were extremely courteous and helpful. Food quality was very good. Room was as good or better as any I've experienced in this price range. Would make a point to stay there again when in Dublin.,5,2015,09,21
206,Fabulous in every way,A sleek stylish hotel at Grand Canal just beside the theatre. This hotel provides it all in a trendy minimalist style. The staff are friendly and effiecient. Our breakfast wa samazing and served by the,5,2015,09,21
206,Excellent Hotel!,"This hotel which is right by the grand canal is extremely nice. And very good value for money. 

My twin room was very spacious with an amazing view of dublin. Bathroom was phenomenal, was almost the same size as the room itself!! Pool there is really nice, same with gym. Very nice and modern, whilst also being very decorative and luxorious. I ate dinner at the bar and had the marker burger which was delicious! Staff were also very nice and helpful. Although my only bad remark about it was through one of the receptionist staff.. i had friends visiting me in the hotel and wanted to go to the lobby, they then needed a keycard in order to use the lifts and as they were down in the lobby the receptionist called them over and asked them all sorts of questions like what is your room no.? What is the name under? Why are you down here? Where do you live? Etc.. confused my friends told him that they were visiting and the rude man then said ""okay well im going to take your keycard and let you into the lift to go to the room, and you have half an hour to leave because of a visitor policy"". Of course i was outraged by this and rang to complain and the man was very apologetic, however it was still unacceptable.. other than this the hotel was phenomenal and would recommend to anyone!",5,2015,09,20
206,Outstanding stay in Dublin,"We loved staying at the Marker Hotel. The location was trendy, yet full of history. 
The staff was friendly, professional without being stuffy. 
The food was outstanding!
We used the Spa services including the massage. The pool was so cool. Loved the ambience.",5,2015,09,20
206,"Modern, AMAZING pool","Our family stayed one week at The Marker for a family holiday, with adjoining rooms. We were on the 5th floor - sometimes you heard music (low) and chairs moving from the rooftop bar - but this only disturbed us one evening, and it seemed to stop by 1 a.m. or so. Next time I might stay in a lower floor.  The pool was simply incredible - a length pool (long and narrow) beautiful black slate, salt water with skylight - just a magnificient luxury to swim there.  The hotel is a bit of a hike from the old city and main tourist attractions.  We liked that - but others may not.  The rooftop bar has a beautiful view, and the hotel seemed to make sure that some tables were always available for guests, which was great. The breakfast buffet had lots of selection and was carefully tended to - I liked the local Irish cheese in particular. Sometimes service could be less than stellar - once they locked our adjoining rooms, once they were still cleaning when I came back with the kids to swim around 4 pm. Breakfast service was great.  Dinner service was a bit slow. I would stay again.",4,2015,09,19
206,Great stay,"Enjoyed our stay here immensely. Is a very modern hotel with great amenities.  Spa is fantastic, nice gym, sauna , jacuzzi etc. rooms are modern , sleek very clean. If facing the front have a nice view over grand canal square and the water. Many of the Dublin hotels of this caliber are in old buildings not that they aren't nice if you want to have the old world charm. This is not that. Staff is great facility fantastic. Only drawback is you are either a fifteen twenty minute walk to the central area or a short taxi ride. We will stay here though next time in Dublin ",5,2015,09,19
206,Modern ,Airy modern feel. Beautiful bar and restaurant. Near Google and face book offices. Gorgeous pool area. Healthy menu options amazing. Would recommend for business or leisure. Friendly service. 10 mins from temple bar and main shopping area.  ,5,2015,09,17
206,"Very, very good","This is the best hotel I've experienced in Dublin and, indeed, the whole of Europe. The service is exceptional and the housekeeping standards just remarkable. Very close to the Docks and the business areas. City Center is a 5 min cab ride. Also, the only hotel which has room service that actually tastes good. Highly recommend the Marker. My only complaint is that it is frequently sold out and I can't get a room there on every trip.",5,2015,09,16
206,"Excellent service, beautiful hotel","Quick and efficient check-in and check-out. Beautiful, clean and spacious room. Beautiful indoor swimming pool. Very strategic location, easy access to business district (Grand Canal area). Lovely surroundings, shops, restaurant nearby.",5,2015,09,16
206,Worth a visit,"We had a great weekend  in Dublin recently and The Marker lived up to our expectations. I loved the design and the location  was perfect for our purposes .The area can be very quiet at weekends as it's primary a business district but for people who do not want  non stop partying this is no bad thing!. 
Staff are excellent , well trained and very welcoming and the only downside was the very poor coffee served - it was of vending machine standard and not what one would expect in a 5 star hotel.
We also enjoyed the rooftop  bar and thought that the delicious cocktails were quite reasonable  for the quality.
Overall a very good hotel and we'll worth a visit.",4,2015,09,16
206,Fabulous hotel in Dublin,"Gorgeous 5 star hotel - clean, comfortable very modern.  Everything was perfect.  My only complaint is that for the price, breakfast should have been included and the service at the roof top bar wasnt particularly good, was really slow on Saturday night and there were very few people there as it had been raining earlier.",4,2015,09,15
206,Nice hotel but really dark in the rooms,"This new hotel looks great when you see it from the outside and has a beautiful and modern lobby area, bar, and restaurant.  The room was nice, but the lighting was so bad in the room, we couldn't see anything, especially in the bathroom.  Bathrooms were also poorly designed - no counter space or shelf space to put your things on, and no hooks to hang towels.",3,2015,09,15
206,Excellent hotel within a walk of the city centre,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights for the Irish Champions horse racing weekend at Leopardstown and The Curragh. 
The room was spacious, the King Size bed was as comfortable as it gets. A large marble bathroom with separate shower enclosure and a large bath. Underfloor heating to take the chill of the marble floor in the bathroom.
The soundproofing was excellent, so there was no outside street noise to keep us awake at night.
Be sure to book bed as well as breakfast as a deal. The choice of fresh food for breakfast was superb. The staff are all trained to a high standard, so service is very good and friendly as well. 
I walked out of the front door and asked a staff member if he could tell me the way to the nearest newsagent. His response was ""Which newspaper would you like sir, and I`ll get it sorted out for you"". 5 minutes the ""Racing Post"" was delivered to our breakfast table. That is what I call service with a capital S. They didn`t even charge me for the paper.

Small touches like this are the trademark of a bygone standard of service.

There are several decent gastropubs and restaurants within a few minutes walk of the hotel.",5,2015,09,15
206,Exceptional!!,"Just arrived back from a long weekend in Dublin, stayed at the Marker Hotel and cannot praise it highly enough! Yes the hotel itself and the facilities were first class, yes the beds were the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept in, yes the rooms were spacious, and yes, I would hope to get most of that from a five star hotel, what I was really impressed with though, was the staff. The attention to detail was outstanding. Each and every member of the team was happy in their role. Nothing was too much trouble and every one of them made you feel you were the only person staying in the hotel....so well done to the staff trainer! If I go to Dublin again, this hotel is where I would stay.",5,2015,09,14
206,simply perfect,"This was our second time at the Marker and the service etc was just as good the second time round.Nice touch was the fact that acknowledged our wedding anniversary and even left a card with two small pieces of cake for us on our arrival.
When we arrived at approx. 15.30 our room was not ready a simple apology and two complimentary drinks were offered.The bottom line is that small touches like this rmakes this hotel a true 5 star.",5,2015,09,14
206,Excellent Stay,"Our stay in The Marker was really outstanding. It is an excellent 5-star hotel, very modern, clean and nice, with a very cooperative and kind staff and very well located in Dublin. It is going to be ""my hotel"" in Dublin for sure.",5,2015,09,14
206,Probably the best hotel in Dublin,"Stayed at the Marker for 1 night last week while on business in Dublin. Got an excellent last minute rate and when I arrived was upgraded to a corner suite which was extremely good. The front desk staff, especially Andre, were exceptional. The hotel is located beside the Bord Gais Theatre and looks out on the water in a new business district in Dublin.. The hotel is a very modern 5 star luxury hotel which has been very tastefully designed with no expense spared. Would highly recommend the hotel and plan to return.",5,2015,09,13
206,Cozy and awesome!,"Great location - my favorite place at Dublin. Clean, quiet, comfortable room. A little bit dark in the bathroom (not really good for make up :)))) But I like this light - cozy atmosphere :) Would love to stay here again!",5,2015,09,11
206,Fabulous hotel,"We stayed for 3 nights last weekend and from the moment we entered the hotel we just knew it would be fantastic.    Our rooms were large and extremely comfortable (although no drawer space in our room) but the shower was fabulous.    Well stocked mini-bar with tea and coffee making facilities.    Breakfast (@21 euros) was worth every penny. On Friday evening we had cocktails in the Rooftop Bar and as it was quite windy outside, blankets/throws were provided  for those who felt the chill.    But by far the best experience was the Spa/swimming pool.  A swim/sauna/jacuzzi followed by a 30 minute facial is an absolute must.   The staff were very friendly and helpful.      Overall a great experience and we would certainly recommend the Marker.",5,2015,09,11
206,Upscale hotel for a great stay!,My husband and and I stayed here for our last night in Ireland on our Honeymoon. We arrived a bit early so walked around Dublin sightseeing. Came back to a spacious room with lots of windows. We went up to the rooftop bar for delicious drinks and a nice view. It was a bit chilly out but the hotel had blankets to use up there. The bathroom was very spacious and sleek. This hotel had the most amazing bed. It was a shame we had an early flight and didn't get to sleep in.,5,2015,09,10
206,Trip to Dublin,A little bit out of Dublin (20 min walk) but nice and quiet with minimal traffic noise - some good restaurants in the area. Check out deals there is a huge vaiance in prices for the rooms. Food in hotel good.,4,2015,09,10
206,Fantastic,Stayed here for 3 nights. The place is great. Rooms are big and so are the bathrooms. The location is great to the city centre. Pool is nice. The food was very good as well. The staff are on the ball and are top class. Dear hotel but you pay for what you get which is great service.,5,2015,09,09
206,Great Stay!!!!,My wife and I loved this place.  Arrived around 7:30am and kept our luggage there as the room wasn't ready.  We freshened up and changed in the spa/pool area which is wonderful.  We used the steam room and pool and really enjoyed it.  They called us at 11:30am to let us know the room was ready  The room was very nice.  We had some drinks on the rooftop which was great. The staff here is very friendly and attentive.  They will do anything do you.  I would definitely stay here again without hesitation when in Dublin. ,5,2015,09,08
206,Excellent all around,"Visited the hotel on business and selected the hotel on a recommendation from colleagues (the location was excellent for offices in the Docklands). The hotel was modern and in impeccable condition. While the decor might not suit all tastes, I found it very nice. All expected amenities were present and well done, especially the pool and fitness facilities, which were fantastic. Breakfast is astronomically overpriced, but that's the norm for a luxury hotel. One comment regarding location would be that it's not ideal for someone visiting Dublin for pleasure, as there's a bit of a hike to the city centre, so there is certainly better situated hotels for that purpose. It's also a bit difficult to find access to the hotel via car, as the driveway is situated in some small streets within the development that the hotel sits in.

One minor distraction - the fire alarm was going off constantly while eating breakfast on our morning of departure. Had I not already been awake and in the lobby, this would have been a real inconvenience, but after a very short evacuation, the hotel identified the false alarm and was working furiously to resolve the issue (a guest tripped their fire sprinkler, so it's hard to fault the hotel for the alarm).

If and when I'm back to Dublin on business, I would definitely stay again.",5,2015,09,08
206,Right on the Mark!!,"Where to start? We booked the Marker 6 months in advance, and could not have been happier when we arrived. Pure class from the moment we arrived. 
Check-in was a breeze and very professional, pleasant and helpful, Meagan is a superstar. Wonderful room decor, we had a great canal view as well. 
The lobby bar is comfortable and a great place to relax with a cocktail, or a glass of wine, or anything really, prey that your server is Godfrey, a true gentleman and someone who obviously loves his job. 
But the jewel here, is the Rooftop Bar, this is where I have difficulty with some of the negative reviews on this point, access to residents is unrestricted and the experience was wonderful. Derek, 'The Director of Rooftop Affairs', and Maurice run a first class gig here, nothing was too much trouble and we absolutely loved it.
Some great food choices, and a substantial drinks menu combined with stunning city views, blankets provided if you are feeling a chill, make this a not to be missed experience. 
A word to Management here, don't lose Derek, Maurice or Godfrey. 
The location is superb, if you don't enjoy strolling arm in arm with your partner, then you might like to be closer to the centre of things, but that is not us. Just far enough out to still be convenient to everything, and the Grand Canal / Docklands area is quiet and safe any hour.
If I have a negative, it is that breakfast is not included in the rate, which is not cheap, but this is a minor issue, as there are a multitude of establishments near by for whatever breakfast experience you desire.

This is a wonderful hotel in a great city, and I highly recommend it to anybody seeking a quality stay in uber chic surroundings, with a bit of Irish humour and craic thrown in.  ",5,2015,09,08
206,Almost fantastic,Arrived at 1pm room was ready on arrival.  Room beautiful and very clean had a few drinks in bar area before using spa which was lovely.  Managed to have a drink on rooftop before heading out all staff amazing. On our return from being out it was our wedding anniversary we decided to have a drink on this occasion the bar man was not fantastic and did not feel he fitted in to the hotel infact was quite rude and unprofessional this was reported on the evening and was dealt with even received a follow up email. When we returned to our room it had been re tidied and rose petals etc on bed very nice tuch breakfast we had in our room the following morning was lovely so all in all amazing apart from one member of staff,4,2015,09,08
206,Underwhelming ,"We booked this hotel as a last treat before we headed off travelling. Our stay didn't get off to a great start. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived to check in, at 3pm. Not really acceptable for a ""5 star"" hotel, especially at the rate charged. Also the roof top bar, this hotels main attraction, closed early. When we went down to the lobby before we headed out we were told it closed was closed before 8pm instead of 9pm like we were informed. General decor is fine and very clean but nothing luxurious or outstanding. Our woes were addressed by management at the time, and were offered complimentary drinks in the bar. Unfortunately by this stage the general experience was spoilt.the spa area is fantastic though and the facilities are wonderful and spotless throughout. There are many better hotels in Dublin with a better location & standard.",3,2015,09,07
206,Fantastic stay,"I recently stayed here for business and was very impressed with the hotel.  The rooms were large and well kept, and the staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating.  The indoor pool is quite lovely and the location is great (although a long walk/short taxi ride away from the tourist sites).",5,2015,09,07
206,Birthday treat,"I took my boyfriend here for 2 nights for his Birthday and it was a fantastic stay. 

Check-in process was smooth and the team were very helpful offering to book us taxis and asking if we needed any help getting around Dublin as it was a first time visit for us both.

The hotel is top quality, looks impressive from the outside - modern and the rooms are huge. We didn't have a view from our room - but the room made up for that. Bed was glorious, so comfortable. Bathroom and complimentary shower products were very nice.

The team also left a birthday cake in the room when advised that it was a special trip which was an unexpected thoughtful extra! 

Minibar/tea making facilities well stocked. TV/Wi-Fi/electronics all good. 

We didn't sample any food or drinks in the bar area however it was very busy every time we went through it.

Nice area in Dublin, we walked into the center everyday which took about 25 mins but it was a nice walk. Would definitely stay again! :)",5,2015,09,07
206,lovely,"We always go for a drink here before and after seeing a show in the bord gais, The marker bar is lovely and the cocktail list and wine list are very impressive. Have only stayed here once and even though I don't usually enjoy staying in overly modern hotels this was very nice.",4,2015,09,06
206,Awesome hotel to spend last night.,"This hotel is pretty much spot on.  Check in, check out, rooms, service, food and location were all very good.  We booked several months in advance so, our rate for the night was quite reasonable.  We called to possibly add another night and it was going to be twice as much.  For what we paid - it was outstanding.  If I had to pay 500 euros, I might be more critical.",5,2015,09,06
206,"Superb Room, Service, and Food","The Marker is definitely a top notch hotel.  Every staff member we encountered did their best to be helpful and accommodate our needs.  Our room was large, bright, clean, and comfortable with a great view out to the Grand Canal.  Bathroom included both a large shower and a bathtub, all modern and clean.  Free WiFi was decent with a quite usable bandwith of 8 megabits per second.  The breakfast buffet was outstanding and included both a great variety of buffet items plus the abilty to custom order anything on the ala carte menu.  Dinner in the hotel's Brasserie restarant was also excellent and reasonably priced.  If the weather permits, don't miss the rooftop bar; priority of seating is given to hotel guests.  The location on the Grand Canal is pleasant, but many of the major sights of Dublin are some distance away.  The closest, Trinity College and the Book of Kells is a 20 minute walk.  But there are always taxis in front of the hotel and most of the sights are an 8 Euro ride away.",5,2015,09,06
206,"Service, Style, Smiles... Excellence","In a city as vibrant as Dublin, it's difficult for a single business to stand out. The Marker's design, comfort, staffing, management, location, and overall excellence shows that with energy and dedication, anything is possible. This is particularly impressive given the consistency that the hotel has maintained during the ~two years that it's been my 'home from home' when in Ireland.",5,2015,09,05
206,WOnderful service and wonderful hotel,I would without fail stay at this hotel the location is superb and the staff / management really know how to run a hotel. I manage all the trips for my company and this was the first one so important that it went well for me. The Marker made it superb and everyone was very happy I would use again and again. It was an extremely pleasant trip and these guys really know how hospitality!!,5,2015,09,05
206,Most comfortable beds and great food ,"Stayed at the Marker for one night with my children. Most comfortable beds ever! Delicious breakfast buffet that had everything you can think of.

Food is delicious and healthy.  Definitely coming back to stay at the Marker next summer!

It is also walking distance from the centre of Dublin.",5,2015,09,05
206,Best service I've ever had at a hotel,"From the moment we arrived the staff have been friendly, courteous and accommodating. The hotel rooms were beautiful and the spa area very nice. I felt very pampered here and will not stay anywhere else in Dublin!",5,2015,09,04
206,Exceeded our expectations in every way!,We recently had the pleasure of staying at the Marker Hotel. We experienced the best customer service we have ever experienced in our travels. The hotel is beautiful. Rooms are spacious and well appointed. Food was excellent. Room service was superb. The spa/wellness area was amazing. The rooftop bar experience is not to be missed. The staff at the Marker Hotel exceeded my expectations by far. Highly recommend to anyone visiting Dublin.,5,2015,09,03
206,Exceptional service,"Wow! is pretty much what sums up my stay at The Marker, the service from reception, to bar, to concierge, to housekeeping was exceptional, nothing was too much trouble,  our room was upgraded without prompt when we told the receptionist we were here for my Birthday, if that wasn't enough we came back to our room to find a Birthday message and a gorgeous cake!! The room was comfortable & spacious and the bathroom was just divine, very clean, great turn down service,  go up to the roof terrace, you get priority as a guest and yet again the staff were great, they gave us blankets & umbrella's when the weather turned to drizzle. I would highly recommend The Marker and will most definitely be back",5,2015,09,02
206,Sheer Bliss,"We stayed here surprising my partner after proposing but it was The Marker that surprised us with a completely unexpected free room upgrade! Everything about this hotel is amazing, the staff are incredibly courteous and polite, the rooms are amazing and the pool area is just sensational. The eucalyptus steam room is a must! Everything about the room was brilliant and we left thoroughly relaxed wishing we could stay longer. Thank you so much for making our engagement even more magical, we will most certainly be back!",5,2015,09,01
206,"Amazing Hotel, great customer service, exceptional stay!","Stayed here for a few nights for my 23rd birthday. From walking through the entrance, I could tell this would be a memorable stay. Amazing architecture, a buzzing atmosphere and most importantly staff presence which is not too over powering but welcoming.

After a nightmare journey (after being diverted to Shannon due to the fire in Dublin airport), the hotel made us forget about the journey and made me start to actually celebrate my birthday. Our room's were not ready, so we ordered a few cocktails from the bar. After only a couple of minutes, the hotel concierge after hearing of our awful journey, knowing our room was not ready and knowing it was my birthday, approached us with free tickets for the Sound of Music in the theatre next door. Excellent touch and a big thank you. 

Rooms are very nice, excellent in fact. Bathroom has the wow factor and if you don't have underfloor heating at home, you will miss it as soon as you leave. Few problems with the shower, however nothing that reception did not sort out promptly. Definitely check out the spa area as well as the rooftop bar! 

To the concierge, maids, waiters/waitress', receptionists, bellboys/girls, spa therapists and everyone else that plays a role in the running of this hotel - thank you for making my birthday memorable and my stay enjoyable!",5,2015,09,01
206,Short Stay,A really good experience. We arrived in a downpoor only to be guided in effortlessly by door staff. Our room was upgraded and perfect. We enjoyed the rooftop terrace. All staff very helpful. The position is within easy walking distance of the centre close to the canal and River Liffey. Would recommend it.,5,2015,09,01
206,relaxing day in the spa,"I visited the Spa and wellness area with a friend recently and we were treated like royalty. The staff were very friendly and helpful. It was lovely to have a nice quiet pool to start off with and lovely relaxing area. But the massage was excellent. Tailored to your own needs, it fitted the bill and I left feeling totally relaxed. It was just what I needed!",5,2015,09,01
206,Great Ambience,"We had a one night stay at this hotel and really enjoyed it. Very clean, very chic, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and the beds were very comfortable.

The hotel is about a ten or 15 minute walk to the Temple Bar area, but there are amenities around the hotel itself. Restaurants, cafes, and stores, etc. The grand canal docks offer a nice, quieter atmosphere. 

Great hotel, would definitely recommend.",5,2015,09,01
206,AWESOME HOTEL,"Cannot recommend enough.  Very friendly and helpful staff and a room that had all the necessary facilities plus more. Free use of pool and sauna and although the location is not very central there are nice places to drink and eat close by. The hotel itself has two fantastic bars, one located on the roof. Only negative is the main restaurant doesn't open on sunday or monday however the bar still serves great food.",5,2015,09,01
206,Up for the games,"Booked this hotel some weeks ago for overnight stay between the Ireland rugby match and Mayo GAA match.
Fantastic breakfast 
Comfortable rooms.
Loved the rooftop bar.
Wanted to have a sandwich around 4:30 pm no seats available even though the restaurant is huge and so us the bar - tip allow your guests the opportunity to eat in the hotelüòÅ",4,2015,08,31
206,Exceptional - Sheer Utopia ,"I booked here to celebrate my wife's birthday as as a treat. This is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in. From the moment I checked in to the moment I left I was treated with world class service and genuine friendliness and interest. The attention to every detail in this hotel is exceptional. We stayed in a corner suite which was fabulous. The room was spacious luxurious and the bathroom was huge and the views superb. We had breakfast both mornings which was delicious with so many options which would
cater for anyone from continental options to full cooked breakfast. The staff were are so helpful and attentive. 
After shopping all day in Grafton Street it was a perfect way to wind down in the Luxurious Spa area. The infinity pool is huge or you can sit in the bubbles of the massive jacuzzi or unwind in the sauna/steam room. 
Staying in this hotel was an experience that just kept getting better and better and the staff could simply not do enough for you. 
After dining out we returned to the hotel to make a visit to the much anticipated roof top bar. It was something I had been looking forward to. The gentleman who greeted us once we stepped out from the elevator was one of the most genuine friendly helpful and made the experience that more special so a massive thank you to him who even went out of his way to come and say goodbye on the Sunday evening when the rooftop was closing. A true gentleman, extremely professional and a true asset to this hotel. Our experience on the rooftop  was magnificent and the views are simply stunning. It's one of the those experience you are grateful to have undertaken. It rounded of celebrations of my wife's birthday in spectacular fashion and one we will never forget. 
We dined casually on the Sunday night in the hotel bar and the food was delicious and service superb. They even let us finish our bottle of wine on the rooftop bar for the last hour before it closed. 
To sum this hotel up its modern, luxurious, glamorous but simply the sheer attention to excellence in customer service sets its so far above any 5 star hotel we stayed not only in Dublin but the world. We could not have enjoyed our stay any more it was a stunning weekend stay. My only regret was having to leave but I will definitely return. Thank you for a wonderful experience.  ",5,2015,08,31
206,Second time review,"My second visit to the Marker and this time it was for my wedding anniversary along with catching a show in the Bord Gais Theatre. I let the hotel know in advance it was a special occasion and they were kind enough to upgrade or room type to a corner suite. 
The hotel and rooms and bright and fresh but in my opinion they're on the small side. The corner suite while very nice had a very small room perpendicular to the main bedroom. Its a strange little room, I say strange as it has no furniture in it. Its is tiny but a I think it would have been perfect for a chaise lounge, or a small dining table.  Other that the size of the room it is lovely and the hotel web site images accurately reflect the rooms. 
The lounge area which I previous had service issue seems to have up'ed its game. The general servers in my opinion were still a bit poor but the floor managers where ever watching and took up the slack. Either way the service was better than before.
As I said in my previous review, The Marker is almost there and could really be one of the great hotels in Dublin if it continues to focus on customer service. One of the best things about the Marker is the pool & spa area. Pools are rare in a city hotel so makes a lovely addition, make sure you try it out.",4,2015,08,31
206,Great staff and service,"Stayed here for a Saturday night and was great service. Room wasn't ready when we arrived so they took our bags which worked for us as we wanted to do some shopping. They called us when room was ready and when we returned to the hotel everything was in our room and waiting for us. Had a drink on the roof top bar which was great and Derek at the door for the rooftop bar got us a great table and made sure there was room for 3 of our friends who were joining us later. When we returned to the hotel later in the evening they arrived at our room door with another complementary bottle of water. Check out the next morning was busy but the ladies at the reception took care of our bags and let us return after breakfast to complete the checkout. Valet parking was reasonable for an overnight stay in the City. Overall good experience, cocktails a little expensive but staff and service and quality of the room and amenities more than made up for it. Will definitely return if back in Dublin for the night.",4,2015,08,31
206,Amazing Hotel,"We stayed here from 28th - 31st August and had the most incredible stay. 
Our flight arrived at 8am and we caught the 747 bus from the airport (using one of the 3 day travel cards from the Spar shop in the airport. It was only ‚Ç¨19 each for the travel card). We got dropped off by the bus at the convention centre by the river and then it's only a short 5 minute walk to the hotel over the bridge. As we were so early, I knew we wouldn't be able to check in but just wanted to leave our bags so we could go out and explore. This was all taken care of and then we left and caught the dart to Malahide and also stopped at Howth on the way back (both worth a visit and the dart is free to use with the travel card). We were back at the hotel for around 3pm and advised that our bags were already in the room and given our key cards to room 616 on the top floor. The staff are all so courteous and friendly. Our room was beautiful and had a lovely view out on to the canal and the square below. We got changed and joined the queue to the roof top bar. The bar opens at 5 and we were there just slightly after. The queue soon got pretty big but we were seated in no time and were able to enjoy the sunny evening with some drinks. It's a great view and I would recommend a visit up there if you get the chance. It's around a 20 minute walk from the hotel to the Temple Bar/George's St area but it is possible again to catch a bus along the way. The Guinness factory is around 40 minutes walk away but you can stop at the Brazen Head pub along the way :)
We spent a couple of hours in the spa using the facilities and once again, the staff were extremely helpful and courteous. In fact, every member of staff we encountered at the marker were so friendly and polite. It really is the most perfect place we have stayed. We didn't eat at the hotel as we generally stayed out most days. There is a taxi rank outside should you need a taxi and there are a few bars and cafe bars around the immediate area but not many. 
All in all, I would definitely stay here again. It's close enough for a nice walk but not in the mayhem of central Dublin. ",5,2015,08,31
206,The Retreat stay at The Marker,"Frankly I couldn't find superlatives to compliment The Marker Hotel as much as it deserves. The design, the staff, the food, the atmosphere...all were top class ! I brought a group of journalists on a press trip there, and they were all very impressed to. Thanks so much for such a fabulous time.",5,2015,08,31
206,The Marker Review,"Very nice hotel with a great service ! Highly recommended ! The rooms are very clean, the bed is very comfortable and the staff is taking care about everything. Did not have a chance to visit the SPA, but I¬¥m sure it¬¥s great as well. Thank you",5,2015,08,31
206,Wow wow wow ,"As I write this review I am sadly travelling back home having stayed at this fabulous hotel for two nights. My husband booked the trip as a surprise, and how pleasantly surprised I was as I walked through the lobby doors and greeted by such friendly staff.  From the moment we arrived to our last moments in the hotel I could not find one single fault.  We dined in the evening one night of our stay, had drinks on the roof top terrace both nights, and dined like kings in the morning for breakfast.  We had the luxury of staying in a corner suite (which I would recommend to everyone). The room was extremely spacious, a bathroom to die for and posh toiletries. I would like to make a special mention to the kind hearted gentleman who was working on the roof top bar on both nights.  Unfortunately I didn't catch his name, but he was so kind hearted, thoughtful and went out of his way to make sure we enjoyed every second.  He was a pure gentleman and a huge asset to the hotel.  It is clear to see that this hotel amongst the funky interiors, fabulous food and luxurious spa area the one thread that holds it all together is customer service. I can not recommend this hotel enough, we are planning our next stay already, travelling home on the train.  Sad to say goodbye but will definitely be returning and soon I hope. X ",5,2015,08,31
206,Top Marks,"Stayed here for one night in August and I was blown away. 

We used the spa in the afternoon and it was absolute bliss. The pool is fantastic and the jacuzzi, steam and sauna rooms were just what you'd expect from a 5 star. Had a treatment which was also great. 

The room was fantastic too. Really high ceilings, a large wet room and great little products. Bed was super comfortable and in case you don't like the pillows there's a menu to choose different types. 

We ate in the brasserie. One of the nicest meals I can remember. 

We then used the roof top bar. It was the end of August so bit chilly but the complimentary blankets were great, oh and so were the cocktails. Really great views. 

The architecture of the hotel is stunning, the location feels out of the way but close enough to the centre, and I could go on, but the usp of this hotel is the staff. We felt completely at ease, really welcome and nothing was too much trouble. 

I would love to go to Dublin again, but it's going to be hard to justify staying anywhere else. 

This was a brilliant place to eat, drink, relax and stay. 
",5,2015,08,30
206,Overnight stay b&b only,"Beautiful hotel staff very welcoming and helpful throughout stay a bit on the expensive side if only using as a stopover, probably need to use the spa and pool have a drink at the bar and perhaps have food there to get best value for money, but i'd love to stay there again",4,2015,08,30
206,Wonderful stay,"Beautiful hotel - fantastic location in docklands area in walking distance from city centre.  The spa at the hotel is wonderful - beautiful pool and jacuzzi etc.

The bedrooms are very comfortable, stylish and spacious.  The bed was so comfortable I didn't want to get up! Really nice bathroom with both bath and shower -also lovely toiletries provided along with plenty of towels, robe and slippers.

Nice to have iron and board in room and also a decent hairdryer.  One other nice touch was a small mirror that you could move around the room to where you need rather than having to use fixed ones. 

We arrived early so the staff kindly held our bags and they were taken to our room.  We had drinks and food in the bar area - both lovely and service was great. It is expensive but worth it.

Staff at reception on check out were very helpful holding our bags due to late check out and ordering airport taxis - very nice stay. Wifi signal is very good.",5,2015,08,29
206,Excellent service in the vibrant Dublin,"New hotel, new room, excellent service. The room was very comfortable, clean and quiet. Bathroom amenities were above standards. Breakfast was very good with a lot of fresh products and very nice staff. We had dinner in the Brasserie of the hotel. Starter and main course were delicious, still to work on the dessert.",5,2015,08,27
206,50th Birthday,Had fabulous stay with group of friends.  Staff were very friendly and attentive to every need.  The breakfast was amazing you could have been as healthy or unhealthy as you wanted and loved the bloody Mary's.   The roof top terrace was lovely and as the weather was fabulous on the Friday night when we arrive we maybe stayed wee bit longer than we should but when the sun shines just had to enjoy it.   A great experience and look forward to visiting the Marker again.,5,2015,08,27
206,One Of The Best Hotels I've Stayed In,"This is just a really, really lovely hotel. There's a huge attention to detail and they don't stop at anything to make you feel comfortable. It's also the cleanest hotel I've stayed in - the rooms are absolutely spotless. 

It's located in the Docklands area of Dublin, a 20 minute walk or 5 minute bus journey into the centre of Dublin. I enjoyed being a little way away from the vibrancy of the centre because it meant we could relax and come back to a quiet, chilled hotel when we'd had enough of sightseeing. 

I'd recommend getting a bus pass from the airport on arrival. I think you can buy them pretty much anywhere. We were there for three days and got a 3-day card that worked out to be about ¬£30 each. You can get the bus to and from the airport and then use the hop on hop off buses and the standard buses. From outside of the hotel, most of the buses that pass you will be going into town. 

We didn't get a chance to go on the rooftop terrace (because the weather was rainy!) but the one day we did want to go up there it was fully booked, so I'd recommend pre-booking if you'd like to go up there.",5,2015,08,26
206,Perfect stay,"On arrival we had a little trouble finding where to park due to satnav bringing us around the wrong side of the building; it was the address given though. Had to abandon car and walk to hotel for directions. Once that was sorted and the kind parking valet took our car keys, everything was super!

Got drunk on cocktails, had the pool to ourselves, stuffed ourselves silly at breakfast, loved the view from our room, had races up and down the corridors...oh, maybe I shouldn't have mentioned that bit ;-)

Had an entirely fab weekend in Dublin, and the Marker Hotel contributed nicely.",5,2015,08,25
206,Luxury Stay,"A gorgeous hotel, perfect for a romantic break.  We were visiting Dublin for a concert and this hotel made our stay extra special.
The rooms are spacious and clean with lovely views.  I also used the spa which has a beautiful pool.
Restaurant food was lovely and cocktails at the bar a treat!",4,2015,08,25
206,Very comfortable,"The hotel is not central, unfortunately, but the bus is close and takes you to the center in about 5-10 mins. The hotel is very modern, Japanese style, and *very comfortable*.  The spa is fantastic, and I still dream about that swimming pool (a highlight in my stay). There are nice restaurants and an organic grocery store next door (open until 10PM). There are options to go to the airport by bus, both relatively close to the hotel, and the ride is just 6 Euros.",4,2015,08,25
206,Best Ever,We enjoyed previous visit to the hotel and booked it for our Silver Wedding Anniversary. Wonderful experience. Quality throughout. Great service. Lovely gift to mark our anniversary. Loved the views from the rooftop lounge. Stay finished outside in Spanish-like weather to leave us with great memories.,5,2015,08,25
206,Last Ireland Stop On Our Honeymoon,"Very classy, plush, luxurious hotel in Dublin. We used this hotel as our last Ireland stop on our honeymoon and we're glad we did. Hotel staff was very kind and courteous. An added plus is the concierge who parked our car for us.  Temple Bar area is about a 20 minute walk. Airport is a 25 minute drive away in the morning. ",4,2015,08,25
206,Very nice,"Stayed for one night. Enjoyed drinks on the rooftop bar before going down to the lobby as it was getting windy. Room was spacious with floor to ceiling windows and black out blinds. New and modern decor, nice bathroom. Valet parking. Would stay again if I got a good rate",4,2015,08,24
206,Wonderful Weekend,"Had a fabulous weekend at The Marker over the August Bank Holiday weekend. From the porters to the receptionists, our every whim was catered to. Had a missing bag on arrival on Saturday but Ina and Fred had it recovered in no time much to my relief. Great amenities and the infinity pool was a delight after a long day sightseeing.",5,2015,08,24
206,Three days of luxury ,"I am very sad to be leaving Dublin after a lovely three night stay at The Marker Hotel. Staff were very helpful and friendly. We spent Friday night drinking wine on the rooftop terrace, which has a wonderful view of the sunset, convenient heating and blankets etc. 

Sometimes I find in 5 star hotels that the staff can either be very dismissive or bother you too much, however this hotel has got the balance just right.

Overall a very pleasant stay.",5,2015,08,24
206,"Excellent location, top notch.","Sadly, we were only here for one night. The hotel is fab and I wished we could've been here longer.
I particularly like the dark hallways- this may sound strange to some but for those who travel a lot, or do shift work, it instantly helps your body relax. More hotels should use this feature for weary travellers.
Next up the day spa is superb, I really liked the concept of the relaxation rooms. If I had to be slightly picky- I would say that our 'adult' time was slightly spoiled by 2 very excitable boys at the pool. This is a very upmarket Hotel and although parents a probably relieved to have the children burn off some excess energy, they should also be respectful of other guests who are wishing to relax too (not the hotels fault).
Food was amazing- cater for the more health conscious, as well as people who are coeliacs - thank you Marker Hotel :)
Great bar area downstairs and of course on the roof top- amazing.",4,2015,08,24
206,Lovely Dublin hotel,"Lovely clean, new, stylish hotel. Very helpful and courteous staff.
Beautiful spa/wellness center with infinity pool. 
In good area beside the new theatre. Rooms were quiet despite the busy area.
Valet parking made it easy.",5,2015,08,23
206,"""Feel relaxed from moment of arrival""","Stayed in ""The Marker"" hotel last night as we went to see the show ""Once"" in The Olympia.  A fantastic hotel, with hotel customer service excelling in quality.  Every member of staff is efficient and dedicated.  As we sat in the bar yesterday evening we observed Managers sweating floors, helping busy staff members, real team work and effort at all times.  Unfortunately due to weather the roof top bar was partially closed, so we were initially told we couldn't go up.  With a short gap in clearer weather, the member of staff on duty came over to us at the bar and asked if we would like to go up whilst we could.  This was much appreciated and a nice touch.  I just can't praise this hotel enough with the attention to details, umberellas coverage from taxis, bottles of water left in car when it was collected from valet to name but a few.  If you want a relaxing, high quality and feel good break visit ""The Marker"", it's a ""must do"" experience.",5,2015,08,23
206,The tech is especially on point,"The Marker is, as everyone else says here, a modern hotel somewhat outside the city center. I enjoyed my stay: everything is quite clean and the breakfast is very good. It's more of a business hotel than others I stayed at in Ireland. Wifi is included and couldn't be easier to connect to. 

What you need to know about this hotel is that while its location is interesting, especially for urban revitalization enthusiasts, it is somewhat far from the main part of Dublin. OK, not that far, especially if know where you're going, but if you just flew in on the red-eye, and your room isn't available, you may have to go elsewhere to get a bite and collect yourself.  There didn't appear to be any food service available on the Saturday morning when we arrived, and we had to go out and find a local pub. There are a few restaurants in the area but that only became clear later. Consider whether all members of your party are experienced travelers who are comfortable with long walks before booking, because you may be walking to and from the city center a few times a day.

I wanted to try the roof deck bar as our last day at the hotel was a beautiful day, but it was full and was a bit of a velvet rope situation. If reservations were necessary I wish I'd known in advance. The weather had been a bit iffy this summer and the roof is not open every night.",4,2015,08,23
206,24 hrs of Class,"The children were staying over with their grandparents for a night so as a treat we booked into The Marker .... and we weren't disappointed!! The service was fantastic, the staff were efficient and friendly without being intrusive, the room was bright and spacious and the bed was so comfortable. There is a lovely rooftop bar were we enjoyed the some cocktails and casual dining. Although the weather wasn't great it didn't impact on our experience. Breakfast was also very enjoyable, we dined at our leisure and the food was superb. The spa and pool area was perfect to chill out for a couple of hours. All in all it was a great place to recharge the batteries for 24 hours. ",5,2015,08,23
206,Dublin stsy,"This hotel is very modern and minimalist and may not suit everyone's taste. The room we stayed in was spacious and the bed was very comfortable but for a luxury hotel the towels were a bit hard! 
Breakfast was very good with a range of options to suit all tastes. Our room rate was 279 euros which was pricey in my opinion - this was bed & breakfast. The staff are all very helpful. The hotel is next door to the theatre which is great for a show and the city centre is easily accessible by taxi at a rate of 8 euro or you could walk which would be a 25 minute walk. 
With a range of hotels in Dublin this is worth considering depending on the rate. I note this month there is a free room upgrade special on which would go some way to justify the rate.",4,2015,08,23
206,"Modern, luxurious and well situated","Found the Marker while scanning TripAdvisor for a place to stay in Dublin. It surpassed our expectations... sitting along the canal and across from the theatre, it's in a great location (although it's a walk to many of the real touristy attractions) and the green hop-on, hop-off tour bus stops just steps away from the hotel.  The spa & wellness centre was very plush and smelled of lemongrass, the rooms had incredibly high ceilings and grand marble bathrooms. The list of pros could go on and on...  The on-site breakfast is expensive but that gave us the chance to eat at Herbstreet a few doors down which was well worth it and definitely should be checked out by anyone in the area.",5,2015,08,23
206,Birthday treat,My husband and I stayed here on Monday night last. What a beautiful hotel. Situated in a lovely area with the Bord Gais theatre across the road. The hotel itself is very impressive but we were so disappointed that the rooftop bar was closed as the weather was probably one of the best days we had all summer. The leisure centre was lovely and very quiet so we had the place to ourselves for some much needed relaxation. The food was good and breakfast was enjoyable. We will definitely be back and hopefully next time we will get to experience the much talked about rooftop bar ,4,2015,08,22
206,The status  of  luxury ,"Loved every second of it the drive up to an impressive  looking building  valet  parking  great value as we left the car for the day and went shopping  in town, beautiful  room fab shower !! The most relaxing spa a huge jacuzzi  loved it all thanks marker hotel and your most professional  staff good job all round I'll be back !!! ",5,2015,08,20
206,Mid term City Break,"I had heard this was a fantastic hotel just opened over the last 2 years, and decided on a family break there.  It is indeed modern, chic and all you would expect from a modern hotel.

The rooms are good size, modern and well appointed.
The leisure centre is fantastic for a city hotel and family friendly- although not for very young.
The roof top bar is worth a visit on its own!
Breakfast is excellent also, even if it is kinda self service.  Only downside, is that it's a little bit of a walk to Grafton St area- although ideal if you are attending BGE Theatre.",5,2015,08,20
206,Enjoyable,"We checked in for one night as we were watching a play in the Bord Gais theatre.  Receptionists were friendly and we were shown to our room by a lovely lady waiting at reception.  Rooms are very stylish and bathroom is spotless.  Breakfast was tasty and catered for all palettes.  Our server at breakfast was very helpful and accomodating.  WIFI is excellent. Had a bit of a problem on check out regarding the bill.  I have to say I was very impressed by the high level of service I received from Mr DeVries, the guest relations manager, who resolved the matter quickly and professionally.  I would definitely return to the Marker based on the exemplary customer service I have experienced.",4,2015,08,20
206,Sheer Comfort and Bliss,"Absolutely everything about the Marker is 5 star, each and every staff member greets you with a WARM WELCOMING SMILE and a genuine interest in you as a guest, In particular the Italian waitress in the restaurant ( Elana i think was here name ), so friendly and engaging and determined to ensure our restaurant experience was a wonderful one.
Every inch of the hotel is immaculate ,shining and spotless.
The rooms are stunning with an amazing view , every comfort is provided,The  beds were so comfy and all the in-room amenities , mini bar , etc, etc all added that  special feeling of been pampered. .
Swimming pool and spa facilities second to none.
The location is central yet in a very quiet and peaceful  area .
You would never imagine you are in  the heart of Dublin .
I enjoyed  and relaxed so much i just didn't want to check out.",5,2015,08,20
206,Always a pleasue,"Love this place!! Always go to the marker when in Dublin!
Great hotel - really modern! Cocktails on the roof top bar are a must. 
Rooms are large with very comfy beds. Great choice for breakfast and the cronuts are amazing!!
Good leisure facilities - there is a pool and a gym. Used the spa on my last visit and I really enjoyed my full body massage. It was so relaxing!!",5,2015,08,20
206,Return visit did not disapoint,"This was my second visit to the Marker Hotel, and the service was again excellent,  Our room was well appointed with plenty of plug sockets.  Its location within easy walking distance of the DART and longer walking distance of the city centre make it ideal for a weekend stay.
Should I return to Dublin this is where I will stay!",4,2015,08,18
206,The definition of 5 star,"I went for a very short weekend trip to Dublin for a wedding and wanted to stay somewhere nice. I booked it through Booking.com and have to say that their service wasn't up to par.
When I arrived at the hotel, I was greeted with someone else's booking details which was a bit of a shock but after I corrected everything, the stay went really smoothly.
We had breakfast at the hotel on Saturday morning and it was really lovely, the staff were fantastic. I also had a problem with my phone charger,so the reception desk charged my phone for me whilst I had breakfast,they really couldn't do enough for you.
The room was extremely clean and tidy, the same can be said for the bathroom.
The only disappointment for me was that I really wanted to have a few drinks on the rooftop terrace but it closes at 11pm on Saturday nights. So we went for a drink in the bar downstairs and I have to say the cocktails were pretty dire. I had 'The Marker Dream' which tasted like soapy water and I ended up leaving it and my mum had 'The Solero' which was also disappointing.
On Sunday, i tried to book a late brunch somewhere nice in the city and the reception desk tried their best to get me a table at the 'Rustic Stone' but to no avail and the guy even printed off all the details and the menu in case I could get through on my own, but it didn't happen.
I would definitely recommend staying here, as it is only a 10-15 minute walk into the centre of town. A taxi shouldn't cost you more than 13 euros at night.",5,2015,08,18
206,I want to live at this hotel!,"This hotel oozes modern elegance from the second you arrive. We arrived after a 30 hour trip and were greeted by friendly staff in the reception. Upstairs, our hotel room was super modern and bright, facing a courtyard framed by other rooms. I loved the colour scheme and the beds were really comfortable (maybe we were just jetlagged but they felt better than normal hotel beds!). The bathroom had a separate bath and shower and was gorgeous marble. The pool and sauna at this hotel were awesome and the breakfast down in The Brasserie was a great assortment of typical breakfast foods, hot and cold. I would definitely stay here again!",5,2015,08,18
206,Really excellent stay! Very memorable,"Cannot speak highly enough of the Marker. Above all the service of the staff throughout is what really heightens the experience. Discreet, friendly and very attentive. A lot of thought, experience and skill has gone into the guest experience from the minute you arrive to your departure. Particular thanks to Peter at front desk, who advised us and welcomed us. He and his collegues took immense pride in their work, way beyond what I have seen even in five star hotels.

The spa, swimming pool area is one of the best for a city hotel anywhere in the world, and indeed overall the look of the place is a masterpiece in the contemporary design hotel category and is complete with roof top bar

You won't have any regrets about staying at this place, though our stay was for pleasure its fully equipped for business also.",5,2015,08,18
206,Great Stay,The Marker was a great stay and a pleasant surprise.  The staff were helpful and friendly.   All wanted to make sure that our needs were met.  Great lounge area in the lobby and also in the rooftop bar.   Food and drink were great.  Highly recommend!,5,2015,08,17
206,Out of this world!!,"We are just back from a long weekend stay  here and I cannot fault anything. The  location was lovely, the hotel was beautiful, the rooftop bar outstanding and the staff  amazing!  We arrived down to dinner late last night (2045) and we were going to visit the rooftop bar afterwards. We asked when it was open till and we were told that it shut at 2100. As we were leaving the next morning the staff kindly let us go go to the rooftop bar and have a drink. This was extremely kind of them to do this and it was much appreciated. The staff always spoke to you and greeted you when they saw us and took time to chat with us which I found very nice. The spa was luxurious and the food delicious. ",5,2015,08,17
206,Held an event here ,"My company hosted a marketing event here.

Staff were top notch, hotel itself is beautiful and perfect location. Hire this venue if you want to make an impression!

We ordered breakfast for guests- no vegetarian option, but that was probably our oversight ",5,2015,08,17
206,""" Sets THE MARK "" in Dublin City","Stayed there last week with my boyfriend. From the arrival to the departure, one of the best experience i every had. Smooth check-in on arrival. The door man, reception team, everybody was very helpful. The bedroom - WOW ! The best i should say. We had drinks in the bar and went for dinner in the hotel restaurant which was excellent. All the staff is very professional and helpful. After we went for drinks on rooftop terrace which was wonderful experience. The view is amazing i should say. For breakfast there was lot to choose from the buffet. Elena and the manager ( Indian guy - didn't remember his name ) was very helpful and professional. We had a wonderful experience and will definitely come back soon.",5,2015,08,16
206,The Marker,"We had a wonderful stay at the Marker.  The service was perfect.  The location was in the relatively new Docklands area. It was a 20 minute walk to town, but we enjoyed staying in this vibrant area.  The staff was very helpful and eager to please.   Great property.",5,2015,08,14
206,Stayed here for a wedding 3 weeks ago,"Beautiful hotel, staff could not do enough for us, very helpful. Really lovely bedroom, spotlessly clean. No one hurrying us out of our room. Amazing room for the wedding reception and an equally amazing wedding meal. The roof garden was an ideal setting for the drinks reception. Would recommend it to anyone for their wedding reception",5,2015,08,13
206,Fabulous,"Excellent hotel & the service was exceptional. From the moment we entered the hotel the staff cannot seem to do enough for you. The bedroom was lovely, the bathroom was huge & the Wi-Fi was fast. We had drinks on the rooftop terrace which we really enjoyed thanks to the friendly staff - can't remember the man's name but his daughter lives in London. Breakfast the following morning was great, buffet style but everything was so fresh & tasty. Will definitely be back.",5,2015,08,12
206,Disappointing to say the least ,"I've never felt so unwelcome in a hotel before. We checked in a few hours before the official check in time, and the front desk hosts were great and more than accommodating. We decided to explore Dublin for a few hours, and came back around 8pm. Our luggage was waiting for us in our room, which was very nice, but that was the end of the customer service. 

We wanted to have a cocktail before bed, so we headed downstairs to the bar. We ordered inside (I had an Irish coffee that was so terrible and bitter, I could barely drink half) and after a few minutes, decided we wanted to sit outside on the terrace. Immediately, our server came outside with our bill, and then proceeded to watch us through the glass windows like we were criminals. Every time I looked up, he was peering at us through the glass. 

If that wasn't offensive enough, we went downstairs on our second night for dinner. We decided to give it a second chance, and sat in the same bar area. The server came over and was quite rude off the get go. We got up to leave, and he pointed to the cups on the table (that were there before, and pushed to the edge) and asked us to pay for them. That was the first interaction he had with us, but he didn't realize he hadn't served us sodas? We went down the road to Milanos, where service was much better and the staff was actually pleasant. 

The Marker Hotel may have quite a few stars and high marks online, but only stay here if you prefer to be looked down on. The staff (mainly in the restaurants) are pretentious and off-putting. For the price you pay to stay here, and how far out it is from the city center, you'd be better off staying elsewhere. ",2,2015,08,11
206,Very good hotel but similar better located available for the money,"Very good hotel, great staff and service and rooms very well appointed, loved the bathroom. Restaurant in the hotel was quiet on a Friday evening and was expensive for the quality of the food. Location is just a bit out of city centre and not the nicest walk at nighttime. Overall enjoyed our stay but would probably opt for a better located hotel for that kind of price range.",4,2015,08,10
206,Excellent Service,"We stayed 3 nights at Marker Dublin. Everything was excellent,Staff were excellent in service from room cleaning to bar/dining staff. It's rare to see all staff in hotels to be of same excellent service,with an aim to please at all times.",5,2015,08,10
206,hit and miss,"The hotel is very modern and in a new area of Dublin but for the price I would probably try elsewhere next time in town. 
I had booked a  room for 3 people and had requested a high floor but this request had not been noted. Despite arriving at 10pm room was not set up. As we arrived the room was only set up for 2 people no extra bed and there was spillage at the entrance of the room. The extra bed was just dumped there and not set up properly, as a sat on it it started to fold up. 
On the plus side the swimming pool is lovely place to relax after a day in the city .",3,2015,08,09
206,Relaxing,My husband and I stayed for two night we had a deluxe room looking over the canal which was beautiful very modern hotel the staff was really friendly and very helpful would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2015,08,08
206,"Almost great, but no bargains in Dublin","It's a classy place, and most of the staff/management seem to be trying hard, but a with a number of irritating niggles. Booked 2 rooms for a family weekend break in June, so me, the Boss and 2 grown up kids who were going to a concert at Croke Park on the Saturday night. Arrived lunchtime, the rooms weren't ready till quite late in the afternoon and apparently a surprise that we might all want to be on at least the same floor so the time at which they were going to get us into a room steadily crept up from half an hour to nearly 3 hours so we had lunch there, although had we realised how long it would take we might have gone into town for it. That said, the rooms were good, nice view, I liked the plumbing. Everyone very friendly but that didn't necessarily translate into helpful. From the time we booked right up to during the stay, we got email invitations to try the Spa, but of course it was fully booked for absolutely everything apparently weeks in advance, and the staff there were quite offhand about using any of the facilities. Roof terrace bar was spectacular although surprisingly difficult to be allowed to go up - more surprising was to get up there and find it half empty, at around 1900 on a Saturday night. A local visitor who was leaving as we arrived commented 'I hope you brought your credit card' - it was a great place for one drink while watching the evening sun over the Dublin rooftops but an evening up there would make Croesus check his wallet.  Dinner in the restaurant on the ground floor was excellent and the service first class. Getting a taxi later after 23.00  to go to try to find the daughters who'd got lost the wrong side of Croke park, was quite a challenge - it's obviously a busy time for taxis in Dublin and the guys on the door kept giving the taxis which did arrive to the high visual coefficient young ladies (of whom there were many, arriving constantly), until in the end I gave him 50 Euros to get me a cab, at which point I got one instantly.  Checking out also took a surprisingly long time. Would we go again? For sure, maybe pre-booking all transport, also booking the spa 6 months in advance, which would give time to save up for a second round of cocktails on the roof terrace.",4,2015,08,08
206,"Great hotel, fab location & super friendly staff","I stayed in The Marker recently when visiting Dublin on business. I found the rooms to be very big, huge bathrooms, funky & modern. The roof top bar which was very busy both nights we were there had an amazing view & great cocktails. The staff were super friendly & helpful, finding us space on the rooftop terrace each night. I have no criticism about this hotel, all aspects were great! Happy customer. ",5,2015,08,07
206,Two night in Dublin,We were booked in to the Marker for two nights following a wedding. On arrival we were told that there had been a flood and that there was no room available. What could have been a nightmare was amazingly handled by the hotel who had already arranged an alternative and brought us back the next day even upgrading us. The hotel itself is impressive and the service impeccable. A must is the rooftop terrace and the wellbeing and spa. A special thank you to Gary Redmond who managed our transfer there and back and even sent a small gift to our room. We would definitely return and would recommend the hotel.,5,2015,08,07
206,My Boss loved it,"As an Executive Assistant, I must ensure when I book a hotel for my multiple executives, that it meets expectations and perhaps I would earn bonus points for exceeding expectations.  I believe I earned the bonus point on this one.  

I booked the Marker for his first stay in Dublin seeing that it had better than average ratings on Tripadvisor.  He really did take a liking to this hotel.  Food, service and hotel was great he said, and the location was perfect as he needed to be in that area for his meetings.

I also found the price extremely great compared to say a chain like Marriott.  

On his second trip, the Marker was sold out so I had to put him somewhere else (The Croke Park - review to follow shortly).  Without having to go into details about that, he asked that I rebook the Marker on any future visits and if not available to try in and around St. Stephen's greens.  Will keep you posted.",5,2015,08,06
206,Fabulous friendly and helpful staff," All the staff were lovely to our two children aged one and eleven.  When we were leaving we realised we had left a book of great sentimental value somewhere.  The staff kindly offered to look through the security cameras to locate it for us.  Amazingly we got a call the next day to say it had been found .  We were very impressed that they went to so much trouble for us even after we had left the hotel.  Our thanks go to all the fabulous staff there. ",5,2015,08,06
206,Impeccable ,"We stayed there for three nights and found every aspect( with the minor exception of parking ) was impeccable. The staff are, without exception , superb both in terms of their professionalism and curtesy.
The rooms were excellent, well appointed and comfortable. We received a complementary upgrade, which we felt exemplified the stay.
Great location and a proper Irish pub on the corner ( The Ferryman).
Fully deserves the 5 stars üëç ",5,2015,08,05
206,Wonderful Hotel - Quality!,"I booked this 4 day trip to Dublin for our 13th (Unlucky for some, but not for us!) Wedding Anniversary.
I reviewed the existing comments on trip advisor and thought that The Marker Hotel was an excellent choice, I was not wrong.
The Marker is situated around a 10 minute walk from the centre of Dublin, which was ideal. The hotel interior is beautiful and the staff are very friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble.
Our room was 426 and it did not disappoint - it was spacious, well equipped (Mini Bar, Flat Screen TV/ Tea/coffee facilities/ Bottled Water/ Hairdryer/ Room Safe/ Iron / Bath Robes/ Luxury Toiletries.........and more) and had a luxury bathroom.
The breakfast at The Marker was really lovely and will set you up for a day of sightseeing - great choice of cooked items and continental items as well as cereals, yoghurt and fresh fruit - at ‚Ç¨24.50 per person for the cooked breakfast a little pricey but excellent quality local produce.
On the Sunday evening we decided to eat in the relaxed bar area, can highly recommend the Sea Bass and my husband had the Club Sandwich.........very nice.
Housekeeping was excellent, faultless in fact, our room was cleaned daily and fresh bath towels provided.
Checking in and out was smooth and efficient, loved the hotel, the city of Dublin and the endless places and exhibits to visit.
Would recommend in a heartbeat, if you are reading this review do not hesitate to book :) happy holidays.",5,2015,08,05
206,"Nice place, Nice people.","The hotel is out of town but seems close enough to walk to everything.  We walked to Croke Park, Guinness, Grafton Street and Temple Bar.

It is directly across from the Bord Gais Theatre and a short walk to the O2, now Three arena.

The hotel was very nice... the entrance and bar area is modern and there is a bar on the roof that is nice and 'chilled out' with live DJ playing lounge type music and great views.  You can of course get cocktails and food at the bars.

The room was nice and big, and the bathroom was very big with a bath and large walk-in shower.  We had no complaints about the room but it wasn't special... i would describe it as forgettable.

The pool was very nice.  Clean and calming with a large steam room and sauna.

The staff at the hotel were very friendly but there was a lot of them!  Everywhere you looked there were members of staff.",4,2015,08,05
206,Luxury stay in The Marker,"Amazing, luxury hotel.  The place is pristine, the staff are courteous and attentive, the rooms are large, spacious and stylish.  Perfection!  Location, although lovely, was a little further outside the city centre than I had realised.",5,2015,08,05
206,Dublin on the canal,"If you want a clean, modern and quiet place to stay while in Dublin,The Marker is your place. The property is right on the Grand Canal and steps from the river. No large crowds, great running areas along the canal, easy cab rides or 15-25 minute walks to most tourist sites. Also very convenient to the DART stations. After a long day of touring Old Dublin we looked forward to returning to our new and air conditioned room.",5,2015,08,05
206,Disappointed ,"The staff, food and spa were very good and worthy of 5 stars. I was really disappointed with the room decor, design and especially the air con. The room was as hot as the sauna with the air con on its lowest setting, reception sent an engineer who looked at the box and told me there wasn't a problem and the room was at their preferred temperature. As a result I had two nights of bad sleep and felt really unrefreshed. Hotel is located in a good area and is only a 15 minute walk from the temple bar and town centre. I won't stay at the Marker again.",1,2015,08,04
206,Birthday trip,"Fab stay in the marker from arriving I was treated like a princess the staff couldn't do enough from Wishing me happy birthday on arrival and upgrading us to a suite we were more than pleased
Only small issue is the breakfast not being included and with the stay being so expensive you would assume this would be a given ",4,2015,08,04
206,The Marker makes its mark!,"I will only ever stay at the Marker when visiting Dublin. Excellent amenities, the friendliest staff and wonderful ambience makes for a lasting impression. The rooftop terrace provides excellent views and the delicious cocktails are not to be missed.",5,2015,08,03
206,Weekend city break,"Great service, friendly staff and outstanding chef. Real shame that the hotel is let down by the infrastructure. Disappointed that despite the great contemporary look and feel the air con pumps out hot air. Faulted twice but advised the system was fine really spolt our weekend. We didn't sleep properly and both have sore throats after what should have been a fab weekend. The design of the shower also adds disappointment, door opening inwards when shower runs to check temperature leaves bathroom flooded and also you knock your arm on inside door handle. Would expect the detail design to work in a place like this! On a positive all meals were of the highest quality and outstanding service by all staff. Would recommend spa and treatments, excellent standard. Unfortunately will not use this hotel again due to the air con, real shame.",2,2015,08,03
206,Wonderful Hotel in Great Location,"I had the pleasure to stay here on a recent business trip.  Its by far the best hotel I've stayed in in Dublin.  The rooms are HUGE and very well equipped, and the bathrooms have luxury to match - huge tub and a separate shower.   I found the service in the hotel to be excellent, the staff were all very friendly.  The roof bar is also a fantastic place to pass a couple of hours on a summer evening.  I will definitely be back.",5,2015,08,01
206,Sisters getaway,"I stayed here with my two sisters. Really swish place, clean, comfie  and funky accommodation, central location but not noisy. Delicious food in the restaurant (so we ate in hotel both nights). Breakfast super too. Bar has fab cocktails. Rooftop bar is impressive but given it was winter we didn't last too long, despite heaters and blankets. Visited this hotel again with my husband in February and all lived up to expectations. Six of us booked in for weekend away this coming November.",5,2015,08,01
206,Loved my stay!!,"Just spent six nights at the Marker and I could not have asked for anything better.  For context my budget is allows for me to stay at ""swanky"" place yet I am not a ""swanky"" person.  The Marker and her staff did not make me feel out of place and I really appreciate that.  The hotel is very nice and situated in a district that is busy by day yet a bit more quite at night, except for the theater goers which are not the rowdy type of crowd.  That said it is within a short walking distance (15 min) to the Temple Bar area, so we were able to head out and have fun but come back to a quite hotel.  

The hotel incredibly quite.  In the six days we may have heard a door slam twice and no talking in the halls.  I know they were quite busy so it must be sound proofing.  The beds were firm and comfortable.  

Services we used: room service (brownies, ice cream), bar, spa (massage, pedicure), and pool.  Not a complaint for any of it.

Most importantly the staff was impeccable.  Every interaction was just how it should be.  I especially want to call out blonde at the reception desk she was so professional (did not catch her name but she may have been South African) also the gentlemen that was the bar manager he waited on us a few times and again could not make us feel more welcomed.

There were two nice breakfast places nearby if you don't eat at the hotel one is called Herbstreet (gets really busy) less than a block on Hanover Quay and the other was Lolly's (breakfast counter with outdoor seating) the quiche was great.  It on Forbes St again less than a block away.  DO NOT EAT AT MCCABES DELI just over a block away on Cardiff.  It was filthy and gross.

As you can tell I enjoyed my stay and would recommend you stay here too.",5,2015,08,01
206,Class in the heart of the docklands.,"The Marker has an understated opulence - an elegance of character that comes not just from the fixtures and fitting, but from the staff and the service they provide.

The rooms are immaculate and large enough that a couple don't feel cramped.  (I shared a room with my teenage son for a week and i had to go out of my way to get in his way.)  The bathrooms are huge - I'm sure you could fit several people in there at once (not that I've ever tried).

The gym has a wonderful pool, spa and sauna with cardio equipment and free weights.  There's enough machines that you won't be able to use crowding as an excuse not to work out.

The bar in the foyer has a refined buzz about it and the food service there is good enough that it provides a more than suitable alternative on a cold and wet Dublin night.  That said there's a very handy and very tasty take-away just around the corner called Lolly and Cooks - perfect if you feel like pigging out in front of the TV instead of going out on the town.

Location wise it is next door to the theatre and a short walk up to Temple Bar.

It's a bit on the pricy side, but you certainly get what you pay for when you stay at The Marker.",5,2015,07,31
206,Excellent Staff but Food extremely disappointing especially Breakfast,"Had a lovely stay here for a special occasion. The staff were all amazing and it is the staff that make this hotel a pleasure to stay in. From Megan at reception to Samantha in the restaurant, also the waitress at breakfast, the housekeeper & the door man at the lift to the rooftop bar & all the other staff - I couldn't find fault with one staff member which is a very hard thing to find so well done to the Marker to having the best team of staff I've ever come across.
What is stopping me giving this hotel Excellent - is the food. For the price that they charge for B&B I was extremely disappointed to see the Irish breakfast served as a buffet and it not individually cooked. Nothing in the buffet was very hot or fresh looking, I did ask for an omelette & it was very disappointing. I must say that the crosissants were very nice. But again it was an expensive night as the breakfast was not up to what it should be for the prices charged.
We also had dinner, at the time we ate it was not very busy. I did not find the main courses to be very hot. Also no sides were served and they were all extra. I got a side of new potatoes which were an extra ‚Ç¨4 and these were not overly hot either. The bowl was not even full so all the extra sides made it an expensive dinner.
The other thing that disappointed me about this new hotel was the relaxation room in the Spa area. 3 areas partitioned off with light curtains to look at - what a view..... one section has bean bags, second section has something similar to a low hammock from a ceiling which are very difficult to get out off & the third section are 2 proper relaxation beds - they need to check out the relaxation in the G Hotel Galway & The Hertiage in Killineard.
I must Compliment the hotel on letting us check in early. We weren't expecting to get our room early just leave our bags and go for some lunch but reception had no problem letting us into the room which is very much appreciated as other hotels make such a big deal out of it.",4,2015,07,31
206,Simply Superb,"My boyfriend and I stayed at The Marker last Autumn, we were so pleased with our stay and the impeccable food that we decided to return again this year. Its not only the beautiful design of the hotel that I fell in love with but the outstanding customer service! On our return this year not only were we greeted with the utmost professionalism, but to our surprise one of the staff members (Mark) recognised us and gave us the warmest welcome back. Mark personally escorted us up to the rooftop bar and ensured there was a table for us and even gave us free drinks to our amazement. This is the second time that I can honestly say The Marker hotel was the highlight of our trip to Dublin and we will 100% be returning again.",5,2015,07,30
206,I agree! Very good,"New, funky hotel, boutique in style but big on space, in a hipster location. Good all round and better than faceless corporate hotel. Staff were very good. Complimentary bottle (big) in the room, ""free"" wifi and an honesty bar.....yes, I know nothing is really free and it's all included in the bill somewhere, but nice touches. Nice",4,2015,07,30
206,"Quiet, contemporary, luxurious, LOVED IT","LOVED this hotel. From the moment we arrived until we checked out: it was all great. Brief visit in Dublin for my Mum's 80th birthday, we wanted a quiet, classy, special retreat for my sister, Mum and I to share. King deluxe with the roll-away bed added, was perfect. The staff was super nice, professional, very attentive. Liked that the porter at the Marker gave us a quick 'tour' of the room (since, laugh if you will, in Amsterdam, due to language barrier, I couldn't figure out the shower!) 
Accommodations/booking remedied a situation (first they emailed us saying we couldn't add the bed to a room we were interested in, even though it says so on the website so they upgraded us, which was not only very helpful but went along well with our plan) Hotel lobby is quite spacious with a bar/lounge & dining area; although we did not eat there - we skipped the breakfast buffet which seemed more food and money than we were up for. Elegant furnishings, subdued vibe, modern touches, sophisticated clientele, quiet (halls are painted black). Visited spa daily (huge lap pool/12 person,POWERFUL jacuzzi/lemon smelling steam bath) which was (thankfully) lightly attended by guests, and VERY relaxing >most perfect after traveling/flight. Malin & Goetz products provided in the room smell YUMMY (want more!) Bed was heavenly. 4 choices of pillow: menu by the bedside/can be ordered simply by calling front desk. Front facing room had awesome view of the River Liffey. Great little grocery store across the square had food, beverages and awesome coffee, cappuccino, espresso in the morning if you don't want to overspend by consuming items in the room. I hope to return during a time when the rooftop is open!",5,2015,07,29
206,Great staff,"Outstanding hotel worth every Penney , staff were lovely , food was nice and rooms were fabulous , great location and views from the hotel , right in the centre of Dublin , cannot wait to return back to this hotel , the pool was amazing and the spa ",5,2015,07,29
206,Understated Quality,"To me the hotel is a modern luxury hotel but in a very different way to the more traditional and older style hotels such as the Shelbourne. 
From the moment I pulled up outside in a cab to the moment my case was loaded into the boot of my cab on leaving I was looked after and made to feel very welcome, nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff, I would describe them as attentive but not fawning. Bedrooms are excellent and provide a great nights sleep, the food was always tasty and drinks well presented, we also enjoyed the pool and spa facilities.
The location is great, a 15 minute walk into the City centre along the Liffey or a short cab ride. In my opinion the Hotel is excellent for a weekend break or a business trip.
The hotel also has a fabulous rooftop bar
I will certainly stay again when I visit Dublin",5,2015,07,29
206,"Wonderful, caring staff",I visited The Marker recently but unfortunately had to leave shortly after check-in due to an emergency. The staff were truly wonderful and caring and I will certainly return as a result. A fab hotel.,5,2015,07,29
206,One of Dublins Star Hotels,"Recently Stayed in this amazing 5 star hotel while travelling home from Spain and visiting the BODYGUARD in the Bord Gais theatre.  this is just across the court yard and an amazing hotel, excellent staff, great comfortable bed and classily rooms",5,2015,07,29
206,Nice Staff and Hotel - but overpriced and not that central.,"I recommended this hotel to some European and US friends who stayed recently. The overall experience was good.   I would definitely acknowledge that the staff are very professional, and it is a  very nice modern hotel.  We especially liked the concierge.  Who is definitely experienced and wise in the ways of the industry.  However, some of the clientele in the rooftop bar on a Saturday night weren't quite what we would have expected in a five star hotel. He managed them as best and as professionally as he could. Also, there were some very drunk ladies in the lobby lounge.  The room prices are very expensive.  Particularly as the location is not as central as some hotels, I think they are forgetting that they are just off Pearse Street!  
As for the bar prices - wow.  Very high.  It was less expensive at the Shelbourne.  Which is also five star but in a very different league. In fact the bar prices are higher than the K Club also!  Overall it was nice but too pricey.  We didn't eat here for that reason, this meant we had to go into the city centre more than we might have liked.  I will be recommending a more central hotel in the future at the same price range.  I gave an average star rating for this review, this is to be taken with regard to their five star rating.  Nice but not an exceptional five star.  For us the food and beverage prices were just too much.",3,2015,07,28
206,A quality experience,We had a superb visit to The Marker hotel. From our arrival to our departure the staff were so attentive.  The attention to detail was excellent and every staff member worked really hard to make sure our visit was an enjoyable experience.  The hotel location is excellent and very central which is a wonderful bonus.  I would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2015,07,27
206,Nice hotel but not worth the price. ,"Stayed here for one night. We were celebrating our engagement but the hotel failed to acknowledge this in any way. 
Our room was very nice and totally spotless. The under-floor heating in the bathroom did not work though. 
Also a member of staff entered my room during the day while I was having a nap. Still not sure why they entered as they left promptly when I woke up. 
The food in the bar downstairs was nice. We enjoyed it so decided to try it again the next day before leaving the hotel. We sat for 20 minutes without any server coming to our table. Not even to take a drinks order. We decided to leave the hotel and eat in a trendy bar just up the road. This is completely unacceptable for a 5 star hotel. 

Breakfast was not included in our room rate. We decided to give breakfast a miss as we were unwilling to pay over 50 Euro for breakfast for two. 

Also the hotel has no complimentary parking for guests. Parking is 24euro per night!! What a rip off. What a disgrace. 

I have recently stayed in comparable hotels in Ireland and The Marker just doesn't cut it for me. It's a shame though because it's location beside the Bord Gais Energy Theatre is fantastic and it's rooms are nice. ",3,2015,07,27
206,1st Call Hotell,"This hotel must rate as one of the very best in Dublin for the service, rooms, facilities and eating and drinking arrears.   The roof top bar is a must if you are resident or non-resident.   Will return again when we next visit Dublin",5,2015,07,27
206,Luxury Stay,"Modern, Clean, luxurious stay. Great location.  Food is excellent.  Great sevice. Had a wonderful time, coming away relaxed and refreshed from the Spa.  Rooms are spotless, spaceous and comfortable.  You really get a 5 Star experience.",5,2015,07,27
206,Breathtaking experience,"Me and my partner are just back from this hotel as we stayed down a few nights for the Ed Sheeran concert in Croke Park. The Marker is situated a little away from the city centre but that's what made it so special for me as it was a lot more quiet and peaceful. The hotel staff were just brilliant and so helpful and made our stay very special for us. We didn't try the food so can't commit, but we did visit the rooftop bar and it was to die for, it was a little chilly so they offered me a blanket to keep me warm such a nice gesture, they really do make sure there guests are well looked after, the hotel room itself was spacious, very clean with a fantastic view out to the canal, I most certainly will stay in this hotel when I stay in Dublin again and I highly recommend this to anyone, you will have an amazing stay and you won't want to leave ha! We went to the Spa and have never been so relaxed in all our lives it was just perfect :) Thank you very much to The Marker Hotel as you made a few days in Dublin very special hopefully see you all again soon :)",5,2015,07,26
206,"Modern, Friendly, Canalside","We spent two days here prior to a cruise: the staff was accommodating (we arrived before the usual check in time but reception stored our luggage and then texted us as soon as our room was prepared so we could take a nap before heading out for our evening in Old Dublin). 
The location is a bit away from the usual tourist attractions, but certainly within walking distance on even a drizzly day/evening. Because of the location, we did take taxis (easily available from the hotel concierge/doorman) more frequently that we would from a more centrally located hotel nearer the ""touristy"" attractions. Nonetheless, we enjoyed the waterfront location watching various activities as well as locals using the water in the ""Grand Canal."" Plenty of cafes, restaurants, even an intriguing food market/eatery. The hotel is conveniently caddy-corner to the Bord Gais Energy Theater (venue for touring musicals, ballets, orchestras and so on).
We had tapas and drinks at the rooftop bar one evening where many couples/groups of friends enjoyed the sunset (rather late in late June) as well as the charming gas fire pit/fireplace. When the wind picked up and the warmth of the day waned, there were warm ""throws"" available in which to wrap ourselves. A very hospitable touch.
Overall the room was clean as were the public areas. There could be a bit more lighting on the hotel room floors: it is rather dark when exiting the elevators. as there is no daylight.",5,2015,07,26
206,"Fantastic hotel, questionable service!","Firstly it is important to say that this hotel is top notch. The food, drink, style and comfort all get top marks. As they all should for a hotel that is this expensive.

We travelled as a party of 6 (three couples) but only 2 of the rooms were ready & there were some annoying and unnecessary mix-ups upon check-in.

The rooms are mightily impressive. Very spacious & well appointed. Bright & minimal with comfortable, large beds. Good wardrobe space, a safe, mini bar and full-length mirror. Bathroom is huge, bath and large shower with lots of space.

Our first stop after checking in was the Rooftop Bar. This is one of the absolute highlights of the short trip. Fantastic views, beautiful tasting plates, great cocktails, cold beers and delicious bubbles!! But be prepared to pay for the privilege. Pricey but totally worth it.

After returning from a show in the Bord Gais Theatre (which is a 30 second walk!) the queue for the rooftop bar was ridiculous and the bar was full so we decided to go to bed. Ordered room service but as it was after 11 there was a very limited menu. Pizza & chips were tasty but expensive and the selection of late night room service was disappointing. The food did arrive on time & was hot but some of the accompaniments we ordered did not arrive.

Unfortunately breakfast brought more bad service. Firstly we were waiting for a table because 'usually there are only tables for two or four' and then our server mostly ignored us. He poured coffee but didn't bring milk for 15 mins, left empty plates on the table for 20 mins, we had to call him back to take orders. Individually all small problems but together they were pretty frustrating. That said the extra order of pancakes, Maple syrup & crispy bacon was delicious as were the poached & scrambled eggs, fresh fruit & yoghurts. Sausages, mini pastries and toast were less impressive.

At check-out all of our bills were incorrect with additional charges and mix-up causing much annoyance. Staff did apologise & try to rectify the situation but still frustrating. Valet parking was very good.

Overall The Marker is a fantastic hotel but the service needs some serious polishing up. Service in the Rooftop Bar was excellent, it's a pity that standard isn't available throughout the hotel. Definitely worth a trip but expect it to dent the bank balance!

TIP: Get the cronuts early before they are gone. And try the amazing chunky chips with chipotle sauce!",4,2015,07,26
206,Great hotel,"Just back from our second visit at the Marker hotel excellent hotel excellent service fantastic rooms

The only small negative which lets the hotel down a little bit is breakfast for such a beautiful hotel breakfast does not sell this hotel you have to pay extra for pancakes etc!! We didn't have a fry only pancakes but this cost us 10.00 on top of the bb rate!!

206,Relaxing weekend in Dublin ,"The hotel situated in the grand canal area of Dublin close to the convention centre, 3Arena, and Bord Gais Energy Theatre, so lots of opportunities to listen to music or see a show. This is a newly generated area, several restaurants, lots of cafe's and places to buy fresh food for a picnic. The hotel has a restaurant, roof top bar, gym, spar and swimming pool. The pool and hot tub are a great place to unwind after a day walking around Dublin. The rooms are very spacious and very comfortable. The staff are very friendly, welcoming and helpful. It's a bit of a walk into the city centre, the parks and temple bar, but not too far. The Marker hotel a perfect place to make a base, explore the city and if you prefer the quieter part of the city it's away from the hustle and bustle of temple bar.",5,2015,07,25
206,Trendy but very comfortable,"This hotel has style and substance! Set in the docklands area of the city with lots of places to sit outside including a roof top bar, this hotel is tastefully decorated and the rooms have great attention to detail. Robes and slippers, free mineral water, an excellent mini bar, a huge luxury bathroom and a wonderful bed made my stay here extremely comfortable! The staff are friendly and attentive and the breakfast freshly cooked or buffet style. A great place to stay.",4,2015,07,23
206,Fantastic Time at the Marker Hotel,"I went to the Marker last week-end as I won a prize to have dinner, stay and tickets to an TV show to be audience participants.  The Marker was amazing.  We stayed in the corner suite which is really spacious, beautiful decor, very modern, the bahtroom was really large, all done in black Marble, The suite has everything you need, a fully packed mini bar, tea and coffee making facilities.  You have views of the Dublin Harbour and Dublin Mountains.  We decided to pay for the overnight parking which costs ‚Ç¨24.  Your driver meets you outside the front and brings the car to the car park for you, leaving you free.  The Marker Bar is a wonderful coctail bar on the very top of the Hotel.  This is a must, we really enjoyed it.  Again it boasts views of the Dublin Mountains and the Dockland.  The staff coudn't do enough for you and you can have a snack and coctail there overlooking the whole of Dublin.  The dinner was amazing, I had Steak and my Fiance had the Fish.  We had Rose wine with that which was also realy fruity and nice.  I would highly recommend staying at the Marker and eating out there too.  They have a wonderful Spa with pool, we didn't visit that this time, but will again.  Aoife",5,2015,07,22
206,Amazing hotel,"I have stayed here twice with my girlfriend and I have had a ball both times. The hotel looks amazing. The service is unbelievable, they can't do enough for you, food and drinks is unbelievable also. Everywhere I stay I compare to the marker and nowhere has came close to it, it's a nice modern hotel with a nice vibe. Will be back over and over again.",5,2015,07,21
206,The Marker Hotel Weekend,"Fantastic!  Cocktails took a little longer than expected on one or two occasions which was probably just as well! Highly recommended.  Really can't wait for the next occasion to book a stay here.  Convenience, service, quality on all fronts.",5,2015,07,20
206,Excellent hotel,This is a modern hotel the rooms are very good and comfortable the staff are very friendly helpful and efficient the bar is a great place to have a drink and food it has a bar on the roof which has a great view its situated at docklands with a few restaurants close by its about 20 minutes walk into the city the only thing we did not like was the dimly lit passage ways,5,2015,07,20
206,First Class Service,My wife and I stayed in the Marker for one night to celebrate a birthday and we found the hotel to be faultless. The staff were so friendly and helpful and the hotel itself is beautiful. Our room had a spectacular view of the canal and while we didn't dine in the hotel we made time to have a drink in the rooftop bar and we were delighted that we did as it is spectacular. We also availed of the leisure centre and found it up to the same standard as the rest of the hotel.   The hotel is not a cheap place to stay but you get what you pay for and it is still good value for money because of the all round quality on display.,5,2015,07,20
206,Beautiful,"Lovey overnight stay in the Marker Hotel. Spacious room with beautiful large bathroom. We had everything we needed, tea / coffiee making facilities, iron, safe, hairdresser, bathrobes, slippers etc....
The rooftop bar is spectacular and a must when you visit this hotel. Near the centre - nice walk or short taxi ride.",5,2015,07,20
206,Wonderful Stay at the Marker Hotel,"Myself and my Fiance won tickets to stay at the Marker Hotel and a night out at the Saturday Night With Miriam show in RTE.  we totally enjoyed our stay in the Marker Hotel.  From the moment we arrived the staff couldn't have been nicer, we decided to go for overnight parking and only had to leave our car at the front door of the Marker and the driver parked it safely for us in the car park, this is ‚Ç¨24 and to us worth it.  Then we checked into our room which was a corner suite which was just beautiful withe great views of Dublin.  The room was spacious with all the facilities, nice touches like cake and Chocolates on the pillow.  The bathroom was super size and very beautifully decorated, with black marble and really big with a lovely elegent bath and walk into shower.  we decided to go and check out the rooftop bar which is absolutely beautiful with views of the Dublin Mountains and the Harbour, you can enjoy some nibbles there and a coctail, an experience not to be missed.  The staff were just lovely and I couldn't fault this hotel, highly recommend it.",5,2015,07,20
206,The best 2 nights of our 13 night vacation.,"First off, we made a huge mistake on our trip to Ireland. And that was staying at the Marker the first two nights. Why? Because every other place we stayed in comparison didn't stand a chance. Each night upon checking into our new hotel we would joke about turning around back towards Dublin and doing another night at this amazing hotel. From the beautiful rooms, to the roof top bar, and the incredible infinity pools on the ground level, this place leaves nothing to be desired. But the best part of this stay was without question the staff, who never ceased to be friendly, helpful, and accommodating to two awe struck travelers on their first trip to Ireland. Despite not having a reservation on the last day of our trip, they were nice enough to hold our bags so we could explore the city once last time while we waited for our flight to take off early the next morning. The next time we find ourselves in Ireland, we will be coming back.",5,2015,07,17
206,"Excellent service, great amenities. Perhaps the best hotel I have stayed.","We've stayed in this hotel as I was attending a conference in the Conference Center across the river (10 min walk).  This is probably the best hotel we've stayed so far in terms of service and amenities.  There are other hotels that offer these amenities, but their service is impersonal.  The Marker strikes the right balance and make the guests feel really comfortable from the time they arrive until they leave.

Hotel: this is a new hotel, built in around 2013, in the old docks aside one of the canals. The hotel was spotless clean. I was in the room during one of the cleanings and the cleaning was very thorough. It is the first hotel that I was not afraid to walk on the carpet barefoot.

Amenities: free wi-fi on all rooms, exercise room and a wonderful pool.  Very long, but not deep.  Small kids can swim there safely (adult supervision is required of course) from 10-12 noon and 3-5 pm.  The rest of the times are for adults only.  There is a dry and wet sauna rooms adjacent to the pool and of course a jacuzzi.  The hotel also offers SPA and personal treatments.  All these under a very soothing ambient music.  Really remarkable.

Rooms: quite large, even for US standards.  Coming from the States we really appreciated the multi-national outlets that were on the main desk.  With a splitter we could charge three devices at once and three more in the bathroom outlet.

Breakfast was included in the price.  It did not have much variety or prepared dishes, but it was very satisfactory.  You will be looking forward to a buffet breakfast that includes pretty much everything.  From scrambled eggs (can be made to order too) and meats (ham, sausage, black pudding, etc) to different types of cereals and breads, cheeses, fruits, croissant, yogurt, etc.  Freshly squeezed orange was great. (Truly, not for a box that says ""from freshly squeezed oranges.)

Service: this was the highlight of the hotel.  The hotel staff made you very welcome and comfortable from the moment you set foot in it until your departure.  Everyone was polite but they were also taking an interest at you.  Everyone, from the reception and the restaurant staff to the cleaning crew was amazing. By far the best service we have received.

Surroundings - Restaurants: The hotel has a roof top garden, which we unfortunately did not visit.  But there are few very nice restaurants in the area.  I would suggest HQ which is in the other corner from The Marker.  The hotel is a little off city center, but it is only 15 min walk to the Trinity College area.  You can also go there by bus or get one of those hip-in-hop-out site seeing buses. The ticket for those costs 10-20 Euros for one day but you get to visit Trinity, Guiness factory, etc while you hear the description of the other interesting parts of the city.

One small blemish: we asked for a 4 am wake up call and we did not receive any.  Most likely was an one time unfortunate event, but just make sure you have your own alarm set for backup; which you probably should  do anyway regardless of which hotel you are staying.

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our staying in The Marker hotel and we will gladly stay there again if we visit Dublin.",5,2015,07,17
206,Really neat!,"Great hotel, especially for the price.  We stayed here last May 2014 - the staff was wonderful, the room great - loved the pool!  Staff also helped us with directions, making reservations, getting car service.. Will be back next time in Dublin.",5,2015,07,17
206,"Large rooms, well maintained, friendly staff","The top-hatted bellman with the big smile was the first sign this was going to be a nice hotel.  I arrived early in the morning from an overnight flight and though my room wasn't ready for check-in, I was allowed to use the spa for a shower so I could go about my day.  The rooms are large, with great bathrooms.  The lobby bar is friendly with decent food.  The breakfast has lots of options and the staff, to a person, are very pleasant.  And the rooms are SILENT.  Highly recommend.",5,2015,07,17
206,A Vegas style hotel in Dublin,"Superb room , good view of the canal , great breakfast, moderate pricing at bars including roof bar.

Great service from reception to gym and bars.

I did travel on business but would return for a romantic get away.

The amenities in the room were of great quality including coffee maker , quality coffee, walk in shower with good water pressure.

I am not a picky traveler but this hotel probably spoiled me.",5,2015,07,15
206,Work or Play,"I love this hotel our 1st stay was back in 2013 for a concert, staff where excellent then and still excellent. This is now my 4th visit and this time its for business, and I cant fault it at all.. By far one of the BEST hotels I have ever stayed in.

Rooms are spacious, with great decor.
Food is fanatic.
Staff are outstanding.",5,2015,07,15
206,Roof garden visit,"there are not many rooftop bars in Dublin but we arrived earlier on a friday (about 1830) and there was still tables. They dont take bookings and you just have to try on spec. It's the old create demand and see if those who turn up fit the bill- we did! Looking out over the docks towards the AVIVA Stadium it was very relaxing, prices ok but as you would expect not the cheapest. The place has a really cool vibe about it, wouldnt hesitate to go back and stay at the hotel as it looks like the best design hotels out there.",4,2015,07,14
206,"Excellent hotel, great location.","Great hotel!  Excellent service (particularly when it came to helping us recover our lost luggage) from an extremely friendly and helpful staff.  Very clean, contemporary/modern design, and a quiet and comfortable room.  Would definitely recommend and stay again.",5,2015,07,13
206,Great stay,"Very nice hotel little bit outside of city center. Clean and quiet.  Service is excellent, but this is true for almost any place we been in Ireland.  The only draw back is bathroom ‚Äì typical case of European style over function design, but at the end it worked too.",5,2015,07,12
206,It's all great apart from the location for city centre revellers,"This is a top class hotel. Even the amphibious boat tour guide points out the hotel from the canal.

I'd like especially to praise Pawel, the night porter, who was very considerate towards me when I was having a sleepless night, giving me tea with honey and lemon for my couch.

But don't be mistaken if you're a tourist: it is a long walk from the city centre.",5,2015,07,09
206,Luxury (sigh),"I loved this hotel! The staff - accommodating and efficient! The location - great! The rooms- awesome; nothing like walking across plush carpet onto heated bathroom floors, super comfortable beds, robes and slippers for guest use, fully stocked mini bar. All the luxuries!  The food was an experience in gastronomic pleasure. Would love to return soon!",5,2015,07,09
206,Rooftop bar rocks!,"Great vibe on the rooftop bar. A friend organised a great drinks party here, the lift is maned by hotel staff to ensure only members of the party can join, the seating area and cozy, with blankets and heaters, drinks staff could maybe improve a little, whiskey given in different glasses and a little distracted for orders. But overall amazing hotel, great views. Highly recommend",4,2015,07,08
206,City style,"Stayed in Dublin for a March weekend with unseasonal good weather so this is a positive review without even seeing the roof bar (as it is closed before April). This is a lovely modern hotel with very good sized rooms and bathrooms (this was one of the best bathrooms I've used in years). The staff were very friendly and the bar was buzzing all weekend. We had ""Le Drunch"" on the Sunday which was a nice concept but the food wasn't quite as good as the rest of the hotel, but by no means bad. Definitely worth a visit.",4,2015,07,08
206,Delicious Meal,"A small family get together here we all enjoyed an excellent meal, the service was very good and the hotel atmosphere is so relaxing. The location is lovely with the buzz outside of the Docklands and surroundings. I would recommend here.",5,2015,07,08
206,Great rooftop bar!,"Gave an overnight here to my parents in May. Their room was gorgeous, really spacious with an uber comfortable bed! Very quiet relaxing corridors and lovely spa. The restaurant does delicious food too! With great use of Irish products. The hotel is in the docklands quarter in the trendy Grand Canal Dock with the Bord Gais theater right outside and a lovely view from many of the rooms... though from the rooftop bar it's truly spectacular!! I was at a party here and it was incredible!:) Great spot for a very cool gathering... would recommend!:)",5,2015,07,08
206,Business ,"Just returned from a business trip and stayed at The Marker Hotel in Dublin. I had high expectations as my taxi driver was raving about it before I got there. Stunning interior design! Excellent tasty food presented in the style you would expect when you see the decor. Cheery , helpful staff throughout  hotel. Loved the bedroom and have to say ... I stay over in many hotels over the UK and Ireland and the beds!! Soooo comfortable! Didn't want to get out  of it this morning. Hope to stay here again on my next trip to Dublin üòÄ10 out of 10 guys!!",5,2015,07,08
206,Great experience,"We enjoyed our 4 days stay at the Marker. The staff was helpful. Our room was spacious and quiet. The location of the hotel was great,,,next to a theatre ( plays and Broadway shows),  only an easy 20 mins walk to Trinitycollege, Grafton street and the Temple bar district. The roof top bar gives you a great view of the city.",5,2015,07,07
206,"A really nice hotel, with a great roof terrace /bar","A great time had here, the food excellent, but what made our stay was the roof bar / terrace. The staff so welcoming. Stunning views too. Concierge so helpful, got us booked in to places in the city, thank you.",4,2015,07,07
206,Amazing hotel,"We stayed at the hotel at the end of June and loved every minute of it. We had a superior king room, which was lovely and spacious, with everything you needed. the spa and gym were good and the open top bar amazing. The staff were very friendly and always eager to help. The breakfast was a little expensive but everything was nice and fresh. The hotel is in a lovely area, and as the sun was shining, it made it even better to sit and relax on the quayside.",5,2015,07,07
206,"Fabulous Hotel, amazing experience!","We stayed in the Marker Hotel in June after our civil service wedding. On arrival to drop our car off, the valet staff were fantastic. Their manner and attitude was really professional and very friendly which set a great tone for our stay right from the outset. The hotel manager Charlie, also came to congratulate us which was a lovely touch and we really appreciated the effort. 

When checking in the reception staff were very nice and upgraded us which was a lovely surprise. 

The corner room they gave us was very spacious and spotlessly clean. It came with all the amenities a good room should eg iron, hairdryer, bathrobes etc and the bathroom was also lovely and big. The staff also provided us with some congratulatory cake and drinks which were delicious. We also treated ourselves to some of the hotels 'cronuts' and these were also exceptional. 

We had some drinks that evening in the main bar area and the service was very good and the prices were very reasonable. 

We visited the Pool and Spa the following morning and the staff were friendly and helpful. Changing rooms for the pool were spotless and the pool area was very quiet.

The only downside throughout our stay was that the rooftop bar was not open and having heard of the spectacular views from it, it was a shame we didnt get to have a drink there. 

Overall though we would definitely recommend staying in this hotel and we look forward to spending another night in the hotel soon.",5,2015,07,06
206,Disappointing ,"Unfortunately our stay here for one night was a disappointment. The Breakfast was cold and horrible. Not good enough for a 5 star hotel. Stayed for my mothers 50th birthday which the hotel knew about and they did nothing to enhance our stay for this special occasion. Receptionist seemed  quiet rude on arrival. Other than that a positive was that the other staff were so courteous and efficient. Dinner was lovely, but over all a disappointing stay and an over priced hotel. I Was so excited to stay here and it was a massive let down to be honest. Best experience was the spa. ",2,2015,07,06
206,The Marker,"The hotel is clean and the rooms are great. The only complaints I have was there was a lingering smell from the kitchen all over the hotel. The spa was ok, nothing special. But the service was good and the hotel had everything you needed.",4,2015,07,06
206,Rooftop Bar!,"Visited the Marker on Saturday afternoon with two friends, just to experience the Rooftop Bar! We were welcomed at every opportunity from very friendly staff and Derek at the elevator was especially nice to us, I had forgotten sunglasses and jokingly asked if they provided complimentary sunglasses, and he nipped into a side room and came back with his own glasses for me to use! I was very surprised, he was an absolute gent! The rooftop bar is gorgeous, we were sat in the shade and when we go back we would book a little table in the sun! Staff couldn't have done more for us, even having blankets available for the cold weather! All in all a lovely experience, and one we will definitely repeat!",5,2015,07,06
206,Above and Beyond expectation,"The best service, most comfortable bed, and delightful staff of any Hotel I've stayed with over the past several months.  I would recommend the Marker to anyone traveling to Dublin Town.  The doorman stood by with an umbrella to walk us to the taxi.  The reception made sure we had everything we needed.  Loved our stay and wish it could have been longer",5,2015,07,06
206,Birthday Celebration in Style,"My favourite highlight was having the cocktails on the rooftop lounge. the DJ was superb - pity the floor wasn't suitable for dancing (also hard to walk in high heels!!).
The restaurant was great - the staff were amazing especially in the restaurant.",4,2015,07,05
206,The place to stay in Dublin,Very convenient location.Stayed there for a 2 day business trip and I would definitely go there again if needed. The SPA and the pool were very beautiful. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was amazing. The ceilings were very high which is good and the view from my room was looking at the square in front of the hotel- amazing.,5,2015,07,05
206,Amazing hotel ,"A ways from the hustle and bustle of the grafton st market. (In a good way)  This hotel is trendy and spacious.  We came with our one yr old which is a feat in itself but the staff was amazing and gracious to us every step of the way.  
I highly recommend this hotel.  You will not be disappointed.  ",5,2015,07,05
206,Convenient to Google and Facebook Offices,A posh hotel with stylish d√©cor and a nice rooftop bar.  Very convenient walking distance to the offices of Facebook and Google in the Docklands.  Just across the street from the Bord Gais Energy Theatre.,5,2015,07,03
206,The Marker Hotel....WOW!!!!,"The BEST Hotel I have ever stayed in. From the moment you arrive you can feel the luxury. The staff are wonderful,the rooms are fabulous, 100% will stay here again!!  The location is great, not far from the Luas or Dart station, right next door to the Bord Gais Energy Theatre. Close to the city centre.",5,2015,07,03
206,Fabulous Experience,"Travelled to Dublin for Taylor Swift (two friends), and chose this location because of its proximity to the 3arena.  Check in was efficient and pleasant. We were told the room wasn't ready, but the hotel would call us as soon as it was available. Hotel called quickly, and we were in the room in less than half an hour.  Room itself was very comfortable and clean, had a great nights sleep. Bathroom was huge, and shower had plenty of hot water and good water pressure. My number one issue with hotels is normally with the hairdryer provided. Hairdryer was supplied and actually worked better than my own at home.  Since we had time, we wandered to the pool. Pool and Spa staff were all friendly and helpful. Changing rooms for the pool were spotless.  The pool was clean and a lovely temperature to combat the summer heat nicely. Used the pool twice during our stay, was not disappointed either time.  Overall, the only slight issue we had during our stay was shortly after check-in, there was a fire drill, which we hadn't been told about, but had been scheduled for the Monday before our arrival and the Tuesday of our arrival. While it was a minor thing, a little forewarning would have been appreciated.  Overall, was very happy with our stay, and would stay here again.",5,2015,07,02
206,Amazing!!,"The marker is so modern and is the perfect place to relax after work!! Cocktails on the roof top bar is fab especially when the sun shines - which is rare in Ireland!! The food is delicious! I love the cronuts  
The spa is so relaxing! And it's such a nice way to detox. I often go to the marker to treat myself and won't be stopping anytime soon!! Keep up the good work guys!!",5,2015,07,02
206,Modern hotel - walk to center of town,"The Marker is in a trendy active area with bars and restaurants all around. Modern hotel with friendly staff, comfortable beds, large bathrooms and a rooftop bar with great views of city and water. Fifteen minute walk to Trinity College and O'Connell Street.",5,2015,07,01
206,Excellent,"This hotel was first rate and with the trip advisor upgrade our room was like a suite. We had two bathrooms and a complete living room room. Staff was knowledgable and very friendly, the hotel is in a good location and very modern. We also enjoy the included breakfast buffet.",5,2015,07,01
206,Great hotel!,"Beautiful hotel!  The rooms were clean and modern, as well as the rest of the hotel.  The he staff was always friendly and very helpful.  Being that that the hotel is downtown, there is plenty to do and see within walking distance.  Would definitely recommend The Marker for anyone looking to stay in downtown Dublin.",5,2015,07,01
206,"Great stay. Faultless, unless you want to be literally in the city centre","It's about a 15 min walk to the centre, best done along the attractive riverside.Very pleasant walking back from  the pubs as it stayed light till 10pm. Weather good so no problems with rain!

it's a very new hotel in a business district in the old docklands area, parts of which still need renovation. Taxi to/ from airport c 28-30 Euros.

It was my partners birthday and we were kindly upgraded to to a kingsize room with views over the front / waterfront. Room is modern spacious and luxurious (esp. ensuite with large shower as well as a bath)

Staff and service excellent. 

We ate out in town evenings, not in the hotel. Recommend Darkey Kelly's at the top end of Temple Bar opposite the Christchurch, great food and trad Irish music on weekend. Not as touristy or loud as the bars in the centre of Temple Bar.

Also across from the hotel overlooking the water id the ""Fresh"" Food Store which apart from other nice stuff bakes croissants on site, next to its on site ""Insomnia""coffee bar, so we had breakfast there.

Thoroughly recommend",5,2015,07,01
206,Setting the Standards,"Stayed at the Marker Hotel recently with a friend! From the moment we were greeted at the door to the moment we departed, never have I come across such professional, well trained and curteous staff! They are a true credit to this hotel! Special mention to Paul the GMIT graduate in the restaurant for his hospitality!! The hotel itself is in a prime location and standards are set extremely high! The room was gorgeous and perfectly serviced by the staff! In room technology is certainly advancing! The rooftop bar was like something from a movie. Treated like VIP's. The spa facilities are well worth a visit and Cathriona was most helpful and professional! I will certainly be returning to this hotel in the future and recommending it to all! Well Done Marker Hotel!!",5,2015,06,30
206,indulgent weekend,had a marvellous stay at the marker dublin. beautiful room. lovely spa. lovely staff. only thing i would say is location was a bit far for me from city centre being 60 yrs old.  had to use taxis all the time as walking about dublin sightseeing was very tiring without the walk back to the hotel.,5,2015,06,30
206,Modern Good standard hotel,"Stopped in May in this recently opened hotel. Very high standard hotel in the business end of Dublin. About a 20 minute walk to temple bar street. The room it self is good sized and the bathroom is very large with an amazing bath and shower, the room doesn't suffer from outside noise and the bar has very good pricing for beer considering the standard of the room . Definitely recommend this room ",5,2015,06,29
206,A Joyful Stay,"If you are looking for a truly special experience while staying in Dublin then you can't go wrong with The Marker. From the time we arrived at the hotel until the time we left, every facet of our stay was exceptional.  The rooms are very well appointed, comfortable, and quiet beyond belief. The staff was polished, always at hand when needed, and very helpful both with hotel matters and information about seeing Dublin.  Fine dining, priced accordingly, is available but we did not indulge, We opted instead to sample the cuisine at various local pubs and restaurants to get a more authentic experience.  The area where the hotel is located is modern with terrific views and it is only a 20-minute walk to the heart of Dublin.  Would we stay there again? You bet we would!",5,2015,06,29
206,Great Hotel,"The service at this hotel is exceptional.  The rooms are clean and efficient with a beautiful bath.  The beds are firm but not too firm, definitely not sagging.  The Rooftop Bar is a must to visit with beautiful views.",5,2015,06,29
206,classy place,"My boyfriend and I booked one night in this hotel for the end of our two week back packing trip.  we were both exhausted and needed to relax.   We were greated immediately upon entering the hotel and our bags were taken up to our room. The pool, sauna, steam and hot tub area is very relaxing and guests respected the silence, which was lovely.   We ordered room service which was delicious and delivered hot and promptly.   Overall it was exactly what we were hoping for.",5,2015,06,29
206,top class spa.,"I visited the spa here, very high class and the staff are amazing. I had the Sunday package which lasts 1.5 hours. However you have use of the pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna whilst you are here. The therapist was very thorough. Would highly recommend this spa whilst in Dublin.",5,2015,06,28
206,Overrated and overpriced,We stayed here last weekend. It's a modern hotel with very little character or personality. The only friendly staff were the concierge. The rooms were basic. My partner went up to the roof top bar whilst I got ready and when I went to head up a few minutes after I was told it was too busy and there was no capacity for me. Definitely not worth the cost of a room here for the service was not up to standard much to our dismay,3,2015,06,28
206,Nice hotel for personal or business,"Arrived early, checked in quickly/efficiently. Welcoming staff. Free wifi was fast. Two bed rooms are double beds & beds were comfy. Nice coffee amenities, complimentary water and biscuits in room. Spacious by European standards. Bath was large and well equipped. Halls are dimly lit. Room was very quiet at night despite rooftop and lobby being packed. Great ambiance and energy throughout. Stayed with brother and was a good set up for us. Saw lots of couples, families and business travelers, hotel seemed to be suited to all. Cafes close by. Not in the city center area and is a trek, but would stay here again and would definitely recommend if you don't mind cab/uber to city center.",5,2015,06,27
206,Best hotel in Dublin I've seen so far,"We stayed in the hotel as a romantic getaway. Beautifull and fully equipped rooms, very welcoming and excellent service, relaxing spa facilities. Maybe it is not most luxurious hotel I've been in overall, but definitely the best one I've been to in Dublin, can not say anything negative. If the price is right for you - go for it.",5,2015,06,24
206,Outstanding service,"Our stay was wonderful! our first stop to Dublin, what a wonderful reception!
Fantastic personal service. Taylored staff, hired and trained to perceive and assist.
Just fabulous.
the breakfast was amazing! And the staff remembered many of our group the second morning.",5,2015,06,24
206,"Good hotel, a push for 5* though...","We stayed here last weekend, the service was good, although one or two issues cropped up which we felt could have been better dealt with, although minor I don't think it would happen in a true 5* hotels.

The pool sauna etc are brilliant, possibly the best I've seen in any hotel, the location is a bit of a walk into the center of town (20 mins), the room itself was average.",4,2015,06,24
206,"Perfect, relaxing stay!","We chose the Marker because of the many great reviews that I read about - and it didn't disappoint!  The check in was smooth and very friendly.  The reception and open areas are contemporary and clean.  Our room was a good size with plenty of room for our things.  I really appreciated the sound proofing!!  I hate it when you can hear partiers coming in at all hours of the morning, or hear toilets flushing or worse, the person in the next room snoring!!  We didn't hear a thing!  The mattress and linens were very good.  Good towels.  Great breakfast on site.  As everyone has said, the hotel is about a ten minute walk from Trinity College, but it's a pleasant stroll either along the waterfront, or a quiet neighborhood.  I enjoyed the walk - especially after a good Pub meal!   I would stay here again.  Very comfortable!!!",4,2015,06,23
206,Best place in Dublin,"The staff at the Marker were very helpful, very attentive.  Attention to detail was amazing.  The best hotel I've stayed in. Spotless rooms which were well equipped, and the food was top quality.  The Marker had a roof top bar which was a really great venue.  Brilliant!!",5,2015,06,22
206,Fantastic,"Booked the Marker as a treat for the night for my daughter and I as we were going to see Fleetwood Mac in the 3 Arena.  From start to finish everything was wonderful. Staff were so obliging from the lovely doorman to the reception staff. We were upgraded to a beautiful spacious room. Everything was spotlessly clean. Bathroom was huge and the toiletries were gorgeous.  We went up to the rooftop bar for a couple of cocktails before going to the gig. The view was amazing and cocktails are definitely worth trying. On our return we ordered pizza to be sent up to the room, very tasty. The beds are so comfortable. Definitely worth the price. If your thinking of staying in Dublin and want quality and comfort I definitely recommend The Marker. You wont regret it.",5,2015,06,22
206,The Marker Does Hotel Stay Right!!!,"After a harrowing travel experience ending up one day late, I was not prepared for the fabulousness I enjoyed at the Marker Hotel. I was greeted by the reception staff with empathy, assistance, and genuine concern for my comfort. Everything about my hotel stay was remarkable and I am a travel veteran and hotel connoisseur, of sorts! If your travel plans include hotel accommodations in Dublin, Ireland, you will do yourself a huge favor by selecting The Marker. I loved it! Cannot wait to return. I missed one night's  stay, for which I was charged, and I don't even mind! That is how good my stay was at The Marker.",5,2015,06,22
206,Really Nice Hotel,"Loved this hotel, reminded me of a newer W Hotel, service was amazing, staff couldn't do enough to make our stay more comfortable.  Rooms were great, super comfy bed and fabulous marble bathroom, with a great shower and bath tub.  Super impressed.  Roof top bar was really fun, if you're a guest they do give you priority which is very nice, its super popular. Free wifi thumbs up to them for thatLocation is not bad, its a little off the beaten path, takes you about 15 mins or so to walk to Temple Bar, or pretty easy to catch a cab (about 10 Euro with tip).    On the negative side, we just couldn't get the AC cool enough, it always felt stuffy in the room and the windows don't open.  The hallways are very dark and always seemed crowded with laundry and house cleaning stuff.  They need to figure out a more subtle way to make this happen.",4,2015,06,22
206,Great Stay at a top hotel,"Even before we arrived the service at the hotel was excellent. We were arriving in Dublin for Bloomsday early in the morning and the hotel was happy to arrange an early check in. Check in staff were very helpful and assisted us with directions around Dublin to make the most of our day.

The rooms were modern and spacious and well equipped. There is a great spa and pool. The hotel was well located for Trinity College and the bars and shopping in that area. The only downside was that the roof top bar was closed.",5,2015,06,21
206,A fantastic stay!,"We stayed at the Marker for 4 nights in May.  The hotel exceeded our expectations.  The staff was fantastic!  

I arranged to have a birthday surprise for my fiance about a month in advance of our stay.  Robert, the concierge did a fantastic job in corresponding with me and helping me arrange the surprise.  We had balloons, a birthday banner, some cronuts, chocolate covered strawberries and some authentic beers, only found in Ireland.

The room, itself, was clean and spacious.  The bathroom was completely done in marble.  The location of the hotel was a little further away from some of the other hotels, but it was still a good location.  It was about a 10 minute walk to Trinity College and about a 5 min. walk to the River Liffy.  There were some delis nearby and it was really convenient to pick up breakfast, lunch, a snack, and some drinks.

The rooftop bar is a must see.  It seemed very popular as did the hotel itself.  The lobby bar was always filled with people enjoying a drink.  We only went to the rooftop bar once, because although it was very upscale and the service was great, we didn't feel like we were in true Dublin.  My fiance and I were looking for authentic pubs.

My fiance went to the spa area and used the pool and he thought it was fantastic.

I highly recommend the Marker.  You will not be disappointed!  I would definitely stay here again in the future.  I do plan to visit Dublin again!  What a wonderful city!",5,2015,06,20
206,The Marker,"Excellent hotel. Very comfortable and the service is perfect.
Very well situated.
The restaurant is awesome ‚Äì I would highly recommend their Irish T-Bone Steak.
Even though the rooms are slightly over prized ‚Äì it‚Äôs still worth every cent. 
The service staff is very forth coming and always ready to provide assistance.",4,2015,06,20
206,Short but enjoable visit,"Myself and partner stayed there few months ago, for our anniversary. It was a very enjoyable stay - staff were friendly and accommodating, nothing was too much trouble. Breakfasts spot on with excellent coffees. 
We will be back",5,2015,06,19
206,City Break,Marker is 5 star quality of place and staff.   Very friendly and helpful.    great modern design feel but with quality as well.  Location is a bit out of centre - but that was fine for us.  otherwise one of the top places in Dublin to stay.,5,2015,06,18
206,"Great location & rooms, no AC.","We very much enjoyed our stay at the Marker. 

It's only about two years old, so many of the airport bus services didn't know its location, and the closest stop was the other side of the river, which made for too long a walk with luggage. However, the location on the Grand Canal was perfect: quiet, restaurants, grocery store, convenience store, Bank of Ireland ATM across the street, huge Energy Theatre across the street, and the Hop-a-Bus stops on the corner.

Black hallways, large black marble baths accented the uber modern feel. The spa area looked luxurious, though we never had time to avail ourselves. And importantly, the indoor pool was actually a lap pool for swimmers. That's good.

The room and bathroom were large by any standards. The beds and pillows were comfortable, though the duvet was too warm in the warm room. Bedside lighting was great for reading. The huge tub was deep and wide.

I am heat sensitive, and didn't think that would be much of an issue in Ireland, but just in case, we booked the Marker because it specified that it had central air conditioning. Well, that wasn't exactly the case. We could get the blowers to work, but it never got cooler than mid-70s. We had someone come up and look at it, but he thought the blowers were working sufficiently. I'm guessing the cooling system needed freon. We filled the tub with cold water to cool off.  We yearned for a ceiling fan. Of course, while we were there, it was Dublin's hottest day of the year.

There is a children's playground right behind the hotel.

A business center with computers and printers is located in the conference rooms area of the hotel.

The front desk staff was very courteous and accommodating.

So, loved the location, the front desk, the large room and bath. Did not love the lack of air conditioning, and the fact that it's hard to get to from the airport.",4,2015,06,17
206,Everything was Outstanding,"We stayed here two nights after flying in from the US.  Not only were we allowed to check in early at noon, but were upgraded to a corner suite which was on the 5th floor with a great view of the harbor.  Everything we needed was at our fingertips.  It's a great location for eating, visiting sites and shopping.  We walked everywhere.  Loved it and highly recommend it.  A bit pricey but worth it and then some.",5,2015,06,17
206,Fantastic!,"Stayed here for mine and my partners Anniversary. This was a our first time to Dublin and this hotel is one of the reasons I want to go back. The staff were great and polite, the food and drink is amazing. As It was our Anniversary we were given a complementary bottle of wine.

The rooms and great a spacious with a good selection of food and drinks in the mini bar. The bathrooms are huge with under floor heating which is a great touch.

The spa and pool is what makes this hotel though so calm and relaxing,.

Will definitely be going again.",5,2015,06,17
206,Top Class,"Had such a fab overnight stay here recently for work. Such a treat.

Room was lovely. So modern, very spacious and so clean. And for us ladies a hair dryer that stretches to the long mirror in the room!! Such a plus. The beds are also so comfy. 

I ate in the bar as the restaurant was closed the night and had a great feed

The location is great and staff amazing.

Highly recommend it. . ",5,2015,06,16
206,amazing,"amazing, first class, will be back. the service i personally received even prior to arriving was world class. for months i had been emailing the hotel for many reasons, from not being sure if we could make the trip due to my work commitments, to wanting to surprise my partner with certain things throughout our stay. throughout the whole process the staff assured everything would be okay if it turned out we could not make it, and the help i received for added extras was wonderful.

i had paid to surprise my partner with an upgrade to a suite, champagne on arrival on ice in the room. we were in Ireland for her birthday week. due to my work commitments we get to see each other for around 2 months a year, so any time together is precious, and i made this aware to the hotel. the help i received was second to none.

on arrival, parking our hire car outside, we opened the car doors to be instantly greeted by a lovely man welcoming us, offering to park the car for us, and taking our bags inside. a perfect start within moments. 

inside, reception, the bar and restaurant are all joined together, and visually grand.

the view from the huge bay window in the room was beautiful. the quays and ocean spreading out through the busy walk way of Dublin. the bathroom is stunning, the showers wonderful and the bath incredible. the decor throughout is gorgeous. 

the location of this wonderful hotel is top. its a lovely 20 minute walk into Dublin city centre and Temple Bar, so we dropped our bags off and headed out to explore and shop.

after arriving back from shopping, staff had left a note, and complimentary chocolates and strawberries welcoming us to the Marker on our special occasion. a lovely touch. 

upon returning back to the hotel later in the evening after a lovely dinner out and drinks at a bar, we of course decided room service was a must. we ordered the warm chocolate brownies and ice cream. within what felt like moments, a knock on the door arrived with them arriving, they was beautiful. 

breakfast the following morning, slightly hungover was amazing, included in the room, its a help yourself selection of anything and everything. cooked and added to the tables briskly. 

after checking out, and our car arriving back outside to leave, with our bags taken to the car for us again, we left with one more nice little touch, just two bottles of water in the trays for our journey on to Galway.

many thanks for a wonderful experience to all at the Marker. we will be back,",5,2015,06,16
206,"Trendy, fashionable, and comfortable","The Marker Hotel is located on the canals just next to the theatre house. It's in a prime location to be away from the crazy, loud hype of Temple bar, but close enough to walk into the party (20 minutes). The food is exceptional and the chef has an amazing personality. You must try their cronuts!! The rooms are spacious, clean, and well-designed. It feels like a lighter-colored version of a W Hotel. The service is top. I would highly suggest experiencing their rooftop bar for a beautiful view of the city. Overall, a great place to stay in Dublin.",5,2015,06,16
206,First class,"Had a great weekend - hotel was everything we expected And more :) rooms were lovely and lovely to sit outside both the bar and on  rooftop terrace :)
It was my birthday and hotel delivered have made chocolates to my room :)
Really friendly staff and great cocktails!

Will definitely be back.",5,2015,06,15
206,"Looks the Part, but Fails to hit the mark","Recently stayed in the Marker Hotel Dublin. The staffs are extremely courteous and helpful. The room was nice and the finishes were certainly above average. The hotel is well placed in Dublin with easy access to Temple Bar and the main tourist areas of the city. More of a weekend break hotel than a business hotel. However on the downside I would advise against travelling to the hotel with the car as the hotel doesn‚Äôt offer hotel Park. You can park in public car park adjacent to the hotel but this is expensive five hours in the parking cost me ‚Ç¨15, the hotel do offer a valet service this is ‚Ç¨24. Whilst in at the hotel the power to my room tripped when I plugged in the clothes Iron and it took the hotel 20 minutes to reset the power. I placed a breakfast menu card on my room door at 2 AM, however the card was not picked up by hotel staff and I failed to get my breakfast at the planned 7 AM time in my room. The second morning of my stay I went to the main restaurant for my breakfast, the breakfast buffet was a poor standard and costly. As a regular business visitor to Dublin I would be reluctant to rebook in this hotel.",3,2015,06,11
206,Best place to stay,"The hotel is one of the places to stay in Dublin. Design and interior are fancy. The room, especially the bath room is huge. The spa area is very modern and stylish with all you need. Very polite and friendly service. No complains at all, that is my experience.",5,2015,06,11
206,Fantastic hotel for business or pleasure,"I stayed at The Marker almost every week for 3 months as I was working in Dublin. The hotel is sleek and modern and the rooms are clean and luxurious. The staff is friendly, efficient and professional. I would recommend it over the Merrion and definitely over the Westbury. 

As an LHW Club member, I was always upgraded to a Grand Canal facing room, sometimes double upgraded - the canal facing rooms are worth it. The breakfasts are solidly good. 

The beds are comfortable and I was always given feather pillows upon my arrival after I asked the first time. The staff allowed me to leave a bag with toiletries over the weekends and it was always in my room when I checked in. 

The bathrooms are really large with a huge tub and separate shower. The counter has a ton of space, so that I could spread my makeup out. 

The free wifi always worked and worked decently well. 

The only (tiny) complaints I have are: no hair dryer outlet in the bathroom and a dearth of outlets near the bed. One room had outlets built into the night stands, but most rooms had nothing near the night stands, especially for the side of the bed closer to the door. Also, the roof bar was never open whilst I stayed between February and May, which was a bit disappointing. ",5,2015,06,11
206,"They run their business like humans, not robots.","I haven't exactly been here, but i booked for my 1st anniversary later on in July. I was looking forward to the trip however I dislocated my ankle playing football and now i am unable to travel and enjoy Dublin and The Marker to the fullest. Even though I booked a non refundable rooms via Expedia, they kindly refunded my monies back. I'm not rich and I understand The Marker is a business, but they treated me like a human and not another number. Once I am up and about I will be making a trip to Dublin and sure to be staying at The Marker in the coming months / Years.

Thank you",5,2015,06,10
206,"Tuesday, June 9, 2015","Worth 5 stars.  Superb facility.  Excellent pool, sauna, steam room, hot tub & exercise facilities.  Warm staff.  Well trained.  Attentive.  Liked the location although not central...close enough. Concierge provided dining recommendations and those for a walking tour.  And then made the reservations for us.  All were excellent.  The rooftop bar has a great view.",5,2015,06,09
206,Dublin weekend,"Perfect for a weekend in Dublin, 20 minute walk from Temple Bar and all the madness so nice to escape to the lovely roof top and relax.
This is a new hotel in the recently developed docklands area. The hotel is featured in Boutique Hotels of the world and it certainly deserves this. 
It is a well managed with excellent friendly staff, great food and drinks. 
The fitness and pool area are also good.
Who could ask for more for a weekend trip.",5,2015,06,09
206,Repeat visit - Repeat excellence,"This is my repeat visit to this exciting new hotel in the Dublin Docklands. The extremely well appointed large rooms are complemented by a very friendly eager to please staff. Add to this an excellent gym (6am-9.30pm hours), fast free internet, innovative and creative bar menu and you have all the ingredients for a successful (albeit expensive) stay.",5,2015,06,09
206,Wonderful weekend break,"Recently stayed at this hotel as part of a weekend birthday celebration for my wife. Neither she nor I were disappointed in the slightest.

The room was very spacious, clean and had all the facilities you would expect of a quality hotel. The bathroom was fabulous!

The spa facilities were excellent and my wife very much enjoyed the treatments we booked - especially the reflexology. A great relaxing start to the weekend.

The restaurant too was very good, the food excellent and pre-theatre menu exceptionally good value. The roof top bar was very well worth a visit - great views, great service and much needed blankets & heater to combat the cold! 

Throughout our stay the staff were exceptionally warm, welcoming and willing to please. We were never left disappointed by their attentiveness.

If you're happy for a short walk or taxi ride to the centre of Dublin, I can thoroughly recommend this hotel. It is well worth it.",5,2015,06,09
206,"Excellent, modern hotel - 25 min walk (or 10‚Ç¨ taxi) from the centre","We stayed here over the weekend and were very impressed. It's got a very modern look and feel and is a 25 min walk down the river to temple bar or a short taxi ride. When we arrived at 3pm our room was not ready and after waiting 45 mins we were then double upgraded. Not great service but cannot fault the compensation! Our room was excellent with everything you need including flatscreen TV, plenty of storage, and one of the comfiest beds I've ever experienced in a hotel. In addition, we had a walk-in rainforest shower and a separate delux bath. The breakfast was very tasty with quality ingredients and lots of choice although the hot Irish breakfast was not piping hot but this is a minor grumble. The concierge was very helpful and we never had to wait longer than 5 mins for a taxi. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel and it fully deserves its 5 star rating, 
Ps the best tourist site is the prison - brilliantly informative and interesting for all ages.",5,2015,06,08
206,Chic and satisfying,The staff are extremely courteous and helpful. We didn't have to lift a finger. The concierge even helped us with a reservation at a local restaurant. The room was quite nice and the finishes were certainly above average. The pool space was wonderful though the hot tub was on the cool side. Overall a great stay.,5,2015,06,08
206,"Beautiful hotel, warm welcome, luxurious stay, but menu needs a veg-ucation.","First things first - warning, do not use the airport hotel taxi service (they queue up just outside the airport exit, which makes you think they are trustworthy). We were royally ripped off. Driver took us long (40 minute) way to the Marker. Return driver advised we get Hailo app or prebook/check before getting in, should be no more than 25 Euros (15-20 mins).

Marker concierge welcome was brilliant, looked after us and helped us settle in. Friendly and warm welcome.

Our room was beautiful (631). Decor modern and luxurious. My Mum's 65th birthday and they had left a lovely chocolate strawberry and birthday message - nice touch. Luxurious twin room with some super mod cons, the ipod dock is for older generation connections  but just make sure you bring an adaptor if you want to use that, huge bathroom, peaceful ambienace and slept so well! The toiletries are gorgeous! Wish I could buy bigger bottles.

Woke-up bright and early and made my way down to the gym/pool. Didn't open until 7am at the weekend which was disappointing because breakfast starts at 7am too and I love to start my day with a good burn in the gym/pool before breakfast gets too busy, *A 6am start in the gym/pool all week would be better for guests if possible. 

Reception supply water/towels/fruit and a running route (5-10k) in the local area too, which was superb considering the sun was shining. Felt very safe to walk around the docklands for some fresh air. Go and have a dip in the saltwater pool and jacuzzi, stunning - so relaxing! The eucalyptus steam was great, and the sauna was super too! The gym is excellent, great machines and everything you could need. Plus icewater with freshly sliced lemon too.

Breakfast buffet was perfect, poached/fried/scrambled eggs, or omelette of your choice, (plenty of irish sausages and bacon for meat eaters), and a yummy continental breakfast selection. Irish yoghurt in little glass jars are a must try! Made a great start to the day. Coffee piping hot and delicious. Loads of teas available. Well worth it. Friendly team bring you hot toast, delicious hand formed irish butter, coffee and juice. Lovely.

Later on...
Yummy cocktails on the rooftop - a must, what a view. 

Menu/Chef in the bar/restaurant need a veg-cation, meat/fish-eaters are very well catered for, but a better vegetarian menu option needs to be addressed. 

Tips:- Check out my photos to see how amazingly close the following useful facilities are:-
If you walk straight out of the hotel and in a straight line for 2 minutes you get to a strip containing:
Organic/fresh food Grocery shop with some great foodie gift ideas too, 
Crystal Dragon Chinese, I didn't eat here but it looked busy and popular
Cocktail bar again busy and popular
If you turn left out of the hotel for 2 minutes there is:
A cafe/brunch bar - very busy and looked yummy
Pizza Milano (a.k.a Pizza express)
Spar convenience store (cigs, alcohol, sweets, paper, mags etc)
Dublins Green Bus Hop on/off bus sight seeing tour - stop number 6 from their docklands pink route. This tour is excellent and if you buy a ticket for a day you get a second day free! We used this to get around all weekend. When you arrive go to the stop to make a note of the bus times. Very useful!

206,Great birthday present,"Just back from a girlie overnight in the Marker hotel to celebrate a birthday. We all had a fabulous time! The staff were excellent; from assisting us book the tailored package to meet our needs before we arrived to the second we got back into our car at the front door. The best customer service I have experienced in a while. First impressions filled me with apprehension that the hotel would be too minimal for my liking however this tended to give the hotel a calm relaxed ambiance despite it being very busy and in the city centre. Spa treatments, cocktails and the rooftop terrace were fabulous. Location is perfect for access to city centre shopping and all big concert and sporting venues. Five star all round!",5,2015,06,07
206,Couples Mini Break - The Marker,Stayed at the hotel on June 5th 2015 with my husband. Had been travelling on business trip prior to this and just wanted one night away from kids and work to unwind. Arrived on Friday evening and was pleasantly surprised by the facilities and the venue. Really lovely atmosphere and very well located across from the Bord Gais Energy Theatre where we could have booked a show. Enjoyed a really delicious meal in the Brasserie restaurant followed by some well advised Port and cheeseboard. Was disappointed that the terrace bar closed at 11.00pm so did not get to experience this unfortunately and i believe it is great. Rooms are pricey so would recommend trying to get a deal. No need to book breakfast at 24.50 Euro a night with an amazing place like Herbstreet on your doorstop with an amazing selection of breakfast and brunch options but get there early as wait time was half an hour at 12pm on a saturday. Great hotel and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Accommodation is slightly overpriced though.,4,2015,06,07
206,"Great Staff, Lousy Room","I stayed in this hotel grand total 8 days.  The first time 7 days, the second time only one night.  In between the 2 visits I spent 3 days touring the country side.  I had the misfortune of spending the majority of my nights in a room with all sorts of problems.
First allow me to stress that I loved the people there, from the people helping me with my luggage, checking in, maids, everyone that I ran into were incredibly nice, friendly and pleasant.  Absolutely top rate staff!  Well trained with great attitude!  Head above shoulder better than the hotel that I stayed last year at College Green near the Trinity College, where the staff members were indifferent and dishonest and if you are not out of your room by 11:30 in the morning, the maid would simply slip a note under your door and not even bother to clean it that day.

The reasons I did not give the Marker a higher rating are:

1.  The towels were stiff and hard.  Don't know if it is due to quality of the material or the laundry technique.  The other hotels I stayed at outside of Dublin all had much thicker and way softer towers.

2.  Although the rooms are spacious but lacked closed space and drawers.  For a short stay it is not a problem.  But when I stayed for a week, I like to hang some of my clothes in the closet, and put the foldable ones in the drawers; this way I did not have to spend each morning frantically messing up my suitcase finding what to wear.
The 2 rooms I had did not even have drawers next to the bed to put reading materials, glasses, and various items one normally put next to bed.  The so called night table was simply a big solid piece of block put on a built in stand.  One can hardly call it a table.

3.  Lastly but most importantly the first room I spent 6 miserable nights in was like an igloo.  Late May Dublin was still quite cold.  During day time it is not a big problem, but at night when I went to bed there was a very cold draft from the ceiling directly blasting toward the bed.  I tried changing the room temperature to no vail.  The only way to stop this arctic wind was to turn off the fan completely than the room gets very stuffy after a while.
I also had serious problem with the shower.  Even though I don't take long showers, during the 3-5 minutes I was in it the water temperature must have fluctuated at least 3 times.  It turned from just right to scalding hot and if one fumbles to turn the temperature down even ever so slightly, the water became icy cold right away.  To complicate the matter further, the switch/knob did not have hot/cold clearly marked, thus made the fumbling the first few times all the more frustrating.  It happened every single time I took a shoer with no exception which lead me to question the good reviews others had written.
4 days later one I checked back in and was given a different room, low and behold; the new room warmed up quickly and stayed that way.  Although I only took a very short shower, this time the water was nice and warm all the way through!  I think I had a room that had mechanical problem before.  The heating system was not working at all and it was stuck in the AC mode permanently.  The hot water system in the first room also had some mechanical problem.  No arctic wind and nice warm shower I slept well the last night.",3,2015,06,07
206,Post Christmas break ,"With regular visits to Dublin we normally stay at The Westbury but thought we'd check out this relatively new addition to the Dublin scene. 
Whilst the food/cocktails were great, staff were hit and miss, massages were standard and the bed was incredibly uncomfortable. 
Some staff were very helpful and friendly but at the bar they gave off a snobby air. We had two massages which were honestly average, but the chilled pool/sauna area made up for this. 
At 2am after failing to sleep on the lumpy pillows we requested more from reception (not code for anything else!) and new pillows were brought immediately but they smelt as if they'd been in storage. 
Apart from this the room was lovely and the heated floor in the bathroom was great, as were the toiletries. 
Breakfast was also great, lots of choice, friendly staff and yummy. 
Mentioned the lack of sleep/uncomfortable on check out but this was ignored.  ",3,2015,06,06
206,Shopping trip,"Excellent modern hotel. Amazing rooftop bar. Great food. Member of staff monitoring entrance to the rooftop bar was not very pleasant & actually a bit rude to us but he was the only member of staff that we had an issue with during our stay, every other member of staff made up for him as the rest of the staff were all great & very friendly. I will be returning to this hotel. ",5,2015,06,05
206,Down by the Docklands,"Lovely setting....not too far (20 mins) to walk to town centre.....great staff...nice room if a little small...... There was a festival on at the docks the weekend we were there which was entertaining. We did not eat in the hotel as its not for us we prefer the town....however drinks were very expensive but I guess that's what comes with this class of hotel.
      ",4,2015,06,04
206,Excellent Stay and Service at the Marker,"We stayed in a corner room that faced the Grand Canal Square.  The view was quite impressive.  The room was spacious, modern and very comfortable.  The bathroom had a walk in shower and deep soaking tub.  Turndown service every night and robes and slippers provided.

Service at this hotel was excellent.  We were greeted immediately upon arrival.  The doorman walked us into the hotel and introduced us to the front desk staff.  The front desk service was exceptional.  We arrived early and our room wasn‚Äôt quite ready.  We sat down to have a drink and a bite to eat in the bar area and our front desk clerk found us within a couple of minutes to inform us that the room was ready.  

Service continued to be exceptional during our stay.  One night the remote control wasn‚Äôt functioning.  I called the front desk to ask for help and it was almost like someone was at the door immediately after I hung up the phone.

The hotel is new and well placed in the Docklands area.  A bike share station is across the street and a major bus stop is within a block of the hotel.  The commuter rail station is not far away.

We had breakfast in the restaurant and the food was very good.  Out of all places in the hotel, the service here was a bit spotty.  Not bad, but not as excellent as the front desk and the rest of the staff of the hotel.  We had a meal in the bar area of the hotel one night and service was spot on and the food was very good.

We would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2015,06,03
206,Beautiful hotel with great staff,"I stay here for business and the staff are fab, food lovely and the rooms are massive it feels like acsuite. Great location and a real funky bar area and restaurant. Of course when you need to relax there is a great pool and spa",5,2015,06,03
206,Dublin visit,"Outstanding very modern hotel in newer upscale section of Dublin.  Good restaurants in area of hotel.  Rooftop bar at the Marker has fabulous views, don't miss it.   We walked all over Dublin from this location. Room was very spacious and met the expectations of a five star room.",5,2015,06,03
206,Elegant hotel and very friendly service,"Wow! Beautiful stylish rooms with soft carpet, trendy colour scheme and underground floor heating in the luxurious, huge marble bathroom. Shower and bath are separate. Very sophisticated and excellent attention to detail. Well, it is 5 star but it lives up to its reputation. We got a large twin room for ¬£190 without breakfast in order to see a musical across the road at the Bord Gais theatre. So handy for the performance and the 3course pre-theatre menu was delicious. About 32 euro, with unusual vegetables and a Masterchef feel to it. I thought it all good value in the end, although not cheap, of course.  Everyone is so observant about our needs and solicitous, while being (sincerely) friendly. Although the staff may not all be Irish-far from it, they have the famous Irish welcome down to a tee. I popped in to see the spa area which looks lovely but I am glad I did not bring my swimsuit with me as the pool water is dark due to the tiles. I highly recommend the artisan bakery at the end of the block for a delicious breakfast at a much cheaper cost. Il Valentino was a serendipitous find. When we got our valeted car, there were bottles of water left for us, Marker style.",5,2015,06,03
206,Expensive but worth it,"This was a final night on a three night stay in Ireland, first two in Carlows The Lord Bagenal Inn and final night here which was super.

Really can't say enough about the marker, super food and drinks and amazing location. This is a special hotel that deserves every credit.",5,2015,06,02
206,Top marks for The Marker,"Stayed here 2 nights recently prior to flying back across the Atlantic.  Usually choose the Westin or Westbury but these seemed a little staid by comparison, so figured I would give the Marker a look.
 
Arrived just after 3pm and was told my room wasn‚Äôt ready, was told it would be 10 ‚Äì 15 minutes so went to hang out in the lobby and bar area.  Nice, airy modern space with lots of light, lots of business types milling around and having serious looking conversations.  Ended up waiting in the bar for about 30-40 minutes before my room was ready.  Not a great start.  Staff were nice and friendly on check in and showed me to my room, walked me through the amenities - coffee and tea making facilities, mini bar and some sort of secured wifi access that I didn‚Äôt really get.  Room 312, nice big room, very clean, decent size bathroom and a view of the square so no other buildings blocking your light ‚Äì always nice.  Although I understand some rooms overlook the River Liffey, so worth asking about that when you book.
 
I had a light lunch in the bar, smoked salmon with fresh made bread ‚Äì delicious.  Very generous portion of smoked salmon.
 
Visited the rooftop bar for a couple of cocktails.  It was a chilly evening but worth a look as there aren‚Äôt many bars in Dublin with such a view, if any. It seems the bar closes frequently for private events and due to the infamous Irish weather so check if its open upon checking in. 
 
I had dinner at the Brasserie restaurant on Friday evening.  The place was eerily quiet and had that sort of hotel restaurant feel to it which lacked warmth.  The food, however, far exceeded my expectations.  Great to see so much locally sourced Irish produce and ingredients on a very interesting menu without being too ‚ÄúOirish‚Äù  Odd wine list ‚Äì Canadian pinot noir anyone? Guided by my excellent waiter, Juan from Spain, I  selected a delicious Mirto Rioja to accompany my meal.  Good food and attentive service.
 
I didn‚Äôt use the pool or spa, so can‚Äôt comment.
 
I go to Dublin a couple of times a year and usually stay in either the Westin or the Westbury.  The prices were similar between all three for the dates I wanted.  The Marker is a lot newer and feels it with its darkly lit corridors giving that luxurious club-like feeling and fresh vibrant room colours.  It makes the other two hotels seem a little old fashioned.  For proximity to Grafton Street shopping, Temple Bar and nightlife, the Marker loses out as its quite a trek, probably a 20 minute walk to get to the action.  For an overall 5 star feeling however, the Marker wins out from arrival to check out.
 
I will be bringing my girlfriend to Ireland for the first time in July, so hopefully the Marker can lay on a repeat performance of my recent stay.",5,2015,06,01
206,Best in Dublin,"A true five star property with personable service, exceptional rooms, and exceedingly comfortable beds.  Booked a last minute stay and could not have been more satisfied.  Great rate too.  Don't miss the great Dublin property.",5,2015,06,01
206,"Nice hotel, but not 5 Star.","I was looking forward to staying at The Marker and sadly was disappointed on arrival. The lobby/bar area was very busy, which wasn't a problem as such, but it lacked atmosphere and just felt noisy and not relaxing. Furniture and decor look a little tired for a hotel of this rating. Staff took a while to take my lunch order and were not able to answer questions I asked about the menu. I waited quite long for the lunch which wasn't worth the ‚Ç¨20 i paid, coffee was cold.
Reception staff were polite and friendly. The bedroom was very nice and beds were comfortable, nothing exceptional about it.
The restaurant is very open, an extension of the lobby, but service was good and the dinner was excellent.
We used the Spa the next morning. Again I was disappointed. It was definitely not 5 star. There was nothing particularly wrong with the treatment, but I've had much better elsewhere. The thermal/pool area and especially the relaxation area, is very basic could really do with some design input.
I am not normally this critical of hotels, but I really expected more from the Marker for the price we paid. The location was great for the Bord Gais Theatre, but I would rather pay for a taxi and stay further away.",3,2015,06,01
206,Birthday weekend ,A beautiful hotel with exceptional food and service. The room was huge (we only went for a standard) with a big bathroom bath and shower separate we had a great view of the square. The roof top bar is a must see the views are specular and I would highly recommend the marker dream cocktail! ,5,2015,06,01
206,Excellent with a few buts....,"Stayed in the Marker on May 30th with my husband for our wedding anniversary. The hotel, located in the grand canal dock, is modern and impressionable from the outside.
The staff are fantastic and from the moment you arrive they go the extra mile to ensure your stay is comfortable and care free.
The bedrooms are spacious and modern and again very impressive. 
The downside is the lobby area/bar. It is very open and lacks atmosphere. It is reminiscent of an office lobby more than a hotel.
The same general area is used for breakfast and it again lacks privacy when you are sitting down to eat.
Another negative is the spa and pool in that I don't think it's an appropriate area for children.
We paid a lot of money to stay in the hotel for a relaxing time however when we went to the pool there were children jumping in and out of the jacuzzi and screaming at the top of their lungs.
The marker is a stunning hotel but I think these areas could be revisited and with a few slight changes it would make it worthy of its 5 stars.",3,2015,05,31
206,2nd stay and just as good as the first,"I am Mr High Maintenance and cannot fault this hotel. Staff lovely, great design and decor (the hotel, not he staff :-) ) Bar nice, pool fantastic and all spotlessly clean. A short cab ride away from town and nice quiet location. Great for the Bord Gais Arena if you're seeing something there A+",5,2015,05,31
206,Great experience,"We had a wonderful dinner at the hotel brasserie this evening, outstanding by food and service (thanks to Mathieu, our host tonight was lovely and inpecable). Couldn't fault anything, great experience.",5,2015,05,30
206,perfect stay - couldn't fault it,"I would highly recommend staying here. Staff are friendly and efficient, the room was excellent and the bathroom so beautiful! You will love this hotel. also worth visiting the hotels rooftop bar and using the swimming pool; both of which beautiful and well maintained.",5,2015,05,30
206,Dublin Dockside Bliss,"If you are after a peaceful relaxing weekend in Dublin, it has got to be the Marker. Attentive professional staff, beautiful decor and furniture. Food and service fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble. We had a lovely time!",5,2015,05,28
206,Great hotel just outside the centre.,"I did a lot of reading before booking this hotel but as we wanted somewhere special, we decided we'd push the boat out and book The Marker based on the amenities, location and reviews. 

Around 25 minutes from Dublin Airport using the 12.00 Euro return AirCoach, it is only a two minute walk from the coach stop (more on this later).

Check-in was efficient and courteous.  

Room 201 is a great room - spacious, clean, nice bath/shower - until you open the curtains!  Facing you is a black-painted wall, feet from your window, Not a great sight and one I would think similar rooms above 201 have too.

Discussions were had, money swapped hands and we moved rooms. I can say that room 404 was excellent - very similar to 201 but for the views!  

Tea/coffee/water facilities all provided for with an ""honesty"" bar in the room too.  There is also a good hairdryer and ironing facilities are also provided.  The bathroom supplies were replenished daily and were of a high quality.

Over and above the issue with the room, the hotel was excellent.  We can't comment on the food as we didn't eat there (there is a great supermarket 100 yards from the hotel door called Fresh - highly recommended, does hot food, cold food...) but the roof top bar was fabulous with some heated/covered seating and blankets available too should you start to feel a chill.

We also used the pool facilities - the area could possibly do with some additional loungers but if you're happy to bide your time, you'll get somewhere to sit.  Great steam-room and sauna room.  All very clean.

All staff were very polite and nothing was too much trouble.

With regards location, a reasonable 20 minute walk to the centre which is fine before the Guinness but is more than staggering distance after!  Plenty of stores / bars nearer though.

Back to the AirCoach.  On the way back to the airport, the coach stop is very near the end of route and as such the coach can be full - there were only four seats available when we went home with some people turned away - worth bearing in mind!

I've given it 4 stars - mainly due to room 201 (if spending this kind of money, I'd have expected better) and the fact we didn't eat at the hotel means we can't comment on food.",4,2015,05,28
206,"One of my Favorite Hotels in the World! Service, Food and Breathtaking Location","We hosted a big summit in Ireland. Selected the Marker for our host hotel. VIPs from around the world flew in. They all loved it. The food was remarkable. The rooftop bar breathtaking. Rooms beautiful. (Try the penthouse suite! 2 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms!)
20 feet form Facebook's HQs, around the block from Google's. Doing business with the digital leaders? Have to stay here. Everyone is next door!",5,2015,05,27
206,MARKERS JUST FANTASTIC,Stayed here with my wife for 2 nights xmas pressie a fantastic hotel and not a bad word against it I would recommend this hotel to anyone just a tip make sure that when you check in if the top bar is open as it was only open for one night you don't want to miss out on that,5,2015,05,27
206,Great hotel,"We stayed for a two night weekend break, good location about 30 minutes from the city centre.  Great rooms, really attentive service, the rooftop bar is great but be prepared to wait for admission. The bar is good and the brasserie okay but very limited vegetarian choices.  Would highly recommend this hotel but make reservations for dinner if you want to eat in any of the local restaurants.",5,2015,05,26
206,Lunch at Bresserie Bar,"Had a bite at the bar today with my friend, an exceptional modern design with lovely comfortable furniture, the food was so tasty along with the helpful and friendly staff. Kasia the lovely waitress brought us upstairs to the roof bar to a phenomenal view of Dublin. Would definetly recommend it to anyone and I'll definetly come back again :) ",5,2015,05,26
206,Weekend,An all-round great experience. No hesitation in highly recommending this hotel to all... Great location; great facilities; great bars (especially the cocktail bar staff (Miche√°l & Maire - The M&Ms of the cocktail world...!) in the Marker Bar; great food; smashin' trip..!,5,2015,05,26
206,Great location.,"Stayed here for one night with my sister. Meant to be a 5 star rating, but would say a 4. Nice room, good bathroom, very comfy bed. The let down would have to be the lack of tea, coffee etc. One biscuit (for 2 people). Breakfast not included with the price.",3,2015,05,25
206,Wonderful Weekend Break,"A group of 9 ladies stayed at this fabulous hotel last weekend. Can't fault a thing, the staff were friendly, smiling, helpful at all times. Spacious, modern rooms fully equipped. I have read other reviews about the hallways lighting etc but I honestly found the walk from the lift to our rooms ambient and calming with  a luxurious feel to it all, as the carpet was like velvet. The spa is amazing, calming and relaxing, and free to use at all times, a must visit! Breakfast was top quality, the waiters were on hand, helpful, friendly and professional, couldn't ask for anymore.  We had a great weekend stay at The Marker and highly recommend it!  Dublin is friendly, bustling and vibrant, loved it! 15 min stroll into the city or cab for 9 euro approx.",5,2015,05,25
206,Very good business hotel,"Great hotel - decent sized desk, strong, free wifi, good breakfast, strong shower, good hairdryer etc.  Close to one of the offices I needed to visit & a short cab ride to the other office.  Friendly, helpful staff.",4,2015,05,25
206,Fantastic stay,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel the room was lovely and spacious. The hotel staff were pleasant and very helpful. Would recommend this hotel and would return again. The lunch was also delicious in the restaurant with lovely window views. Great service.,5,2015,05,25
206,Outstanding Hotel,"This is an excellent and new hotel. Rooms are large and luxurious. Free strong wifi. The staff is very attentive and helpful. They check is your room acceptable and offer complimentary umbrellas when leaving the hotel to borrow for your trip outside.
The tram is nearby, small grocery store outside, plenty of taxis and bus service on Pearce street to take to Trinity college / Temple Bar area.
While we were there went on 1.) the Traditional Irish Musical Pub Crawl  which was very enjoyable - they take you to two different pubs up to a private 2nd floor area.
2.)  Food & Folklore Dinner at Brazen Head Pub - you go to the 2nd floor private area for a nice traditional Irish dinner and talks about Irish folklore. Very enjoyable",5,2015,05,24
206,Fantastic!!,Service and staff... well what can I say. Out of this world!! First class. Staff were exceptional. We tried out the roof top bar... AMAZING!! the view.. the staff... blankets for everyone to keep warm. Cocktails were so great. Would recommend it to anyone first class service!!,5,2015,05,23
206,Something special ,"Stayed here just one night for our wedding anniversary. The staff here are just superb. Everyone from the reception staff, the bar staff and waiters in the Brasserie - made our short stay very special. There is a real attention to detail. And delighted to see such a lot of local Irish food on the menu - worth a special mention. 

Highly recommended. ",5,2015,05,23
206,A perfect stay in a wonderful hotel,"My first time in Dublin for a business trip. The hotel is situated on the docks in a fully renovated area. It is quiet, convenient and decorated with taste. People are very helpful. The pool is great. Excellent food.",5,2015,05,22
206,Perfect Stay,"Well this was one of the perfect hotel I have stayed in. The hotel is across the river from the Dublin Convention Centre were I was attending a conference. Right from the start the stay was perfect. The Aircoach bus from Dublin Airport will drop you about 100 m from the front door. However this bus is only once every hour and I was lucky that I did not have to wait for it and I took the bus on my way back to the airport as well.

On arrival the check was quick. I had a room on the top floor but had views of the opposite building. The room and the bathroom was immaculate. The real winners for me were

1. Excellent free internet. The login and password are available to you on the TV in your room. 
2. Excellent Java coffee sachets with a French press to make your own brew in the room with some excellent complimentary cookies. 
3. Lovely toileteries with a ""rum soap"" which I last saw in an hotel in America. 
4. Morning newspapers 
5. Wonderful breakfast spread at the cafe

Well I have nothing bad to write about this hotel. The service and staff are as good as in any good Asian hotels. This is the best service I have recieved in a four star European hotel ever in all my travelling.",5,2015,05,22
206,Great Hotel in Dublin,"We stayed at the Marker Hotel in Dublin and were very pleased. The rooms were spacious and modern as were the bathrooms. The staff was very helpful. The breakfast in the hotel was excellent, the best we've had in Ireland so far. My favourite was the Porridge with milk. Best porridge in Ireland I thought. I thought it was overall very good value for a big city.",5,2015,05,21
206,Hip Hotel in the Tech Area of Dublin,"The hotel was very modern with large rooms.  It wasn't like a typical European hotel.  The bar is the lobby was very popular and very busy.  It was evidently a hot spot for young attractive women getting together for drinks.  Also, it appeared that quite a number of foreigners (like us) were staying there.  I'd stay here again when traveling to Dublin.",4,2015,05,20
206,Stay if you can afford it,"What an absolutely beautiful hotel - the room, food, staff, atmosphere, beds, all amazing!  We were lucky enough to stay at a corporate rate.  It is quite pricey, but definitely worth it.  Have nothing negative to say.",5,2015,05,20
206,Nice hotel,"Very nice hotel in the modern docklands area. A bit of a walk to down town but the positive energy of this new area highly compensates. Rooms comfortable, well kept. Roof top bar a bit up itself, but perhaps this does cater its audience. Certainly would stay again.",5,2015,05,19
206,The marker Hotel,The red carpet was out when we arrived. But soon realised it wasn't for me their was a Samsung event later in the evening. Saw Louis Walsh and Vogue Williams. Lovely looking hotel. Corridors a bit dark. Bar and restaurant nice but not really 5* standard compared to a London hotel. Location good. Reception staff very friendly.,4,2015,05,19
206,Rooftop is perfect function venue,"I recently celebrated a family function on the rooftop. My guests were blown away by the stunning layout and furnishings. The food tasted great, cocktails were awesome and staff were excellent. For such a luxurious venue, you might expect some snobbery or pretentiousness from the staff however they couldn't have been more down to earth. I will definitely  consider the venue for future events",5,2015,05,19
206,Best choice for the money,"This might be the best hotel in Dublin for the money.  Yes, it's a bit expensive and some knock it for location; but, it blows away the competition.  The staff is helpful without being stuffy.  The rooms are spacious.  Breakfast is very good.  The bar area is lively; but, not overcrowded, well into the evening.  It's walkable to almost anything you want in Dublin but taxis are easy to find.  Have stayed in other upscale hotels in Dublin, many of them more expensive so this is a very solid choice if this is your price point and you value upscale accommodations and service.",5,2015,05,18
206,Overall very disappointing,"My partner, our two children (aged 8months and 3) and I booked this hotel for the end of March. We were treating our children to the zoo and children's museum and we wanted a gorgeous hotel for us as adults to relax in. I spent ages deciding which hotel to pick and I chose the marker. It looked modern and the location was perfect. We spent ‚Ç¨400 and I don't mind spending the money when it's worth it. Upon arrival the first thing I noticed was the staff were everywhere and very serious and not a smile on any face. It was such a cold atmosphere. I truly felt like a hindrance at the front desk. Also I didn't meet one Irish member of staff. We were shown to our room and it was nice. Pictures on website are much nicer. The view was beautiful though. I also was a little annoyed that the windows couldn't open (I know they are floor to ceiling windows) but it was so stuffy inside the room and the weather was gorgeous. I though I would be into the dark modern look but the hallways were a really dark brown and and actually horrible to walk down. But that's just my taste. Now swimming pool was fine and spa area was nice. We couldn't go to roof top bar as it wasn't opened (it's seasonal) which I completely understand but I wish they made that clearer upon booking because that was one of the main reasons I booked! We didn't drink at the bar because I didn't like the lay out. It's practically in reception and no privacy. Breakfast was fine but I was shocked to see that they had a small menu with lovely sounding things on it but that it was extra price wise. I mean we paid ‚Ç¨30 for breakfast buffet never mind more to have pancakes?? I just didn't feel it was a 5 star hotel, it looks it but staff were mediocre and it wasn't all it was made out to be. I will be staying elsewhere next time I go to dublin which is once a year. ",2,2015,05,17
206,Great hotel ,"Stayed at the Marker for one night only when attending a conference in the convention center. Perfect location right across the canal and even though I didn't get to explore the hotel amenities much, my stay was faultless. Very spacious room and comfortable bed, free wifi and attentive staff. Would stay there again. ",5,2015,05,16
206,Thrilled to be Chilled,"Lovely overnight stay here, whilst it is a bit out of the way, there are enough cafes and bars nearby if you want a stroll around.  Had a drink in the rooftop bar we stood in a queue to get up there wondering if it was worth the wait, it definitely was the view is amazing not to mention the friendly service and decor, probably helped that we were lucky enough to get a sunny evening!  Room was very comfortable plus we had a great view of the Bord Gais theatre and waterway. Spent the morning in the pool and steam room before breakfast. Great find and will definitely be back",5,2015,05,16
206,2014 Summer - LOVE,"I want to go back NOW. After 7 days around Ireland in small town.. staying at The Marker was the best way to close the trip. The room was so amazing and comfortable.. we slept probably too well. The bathroom in our room was gorgeous, however I need to point out, it was the best out of the other two rooms our family had. Theirs were much smaller. 
The pool and sauna rooms were beautiful and perfectly heated for the 60 degree summer. (I'm from California, I'm cold)
Food was great. 
Rooftop bar was GREAT. Views and design were super appealing to a landscape architect. 
One downfall would have to be the price.. everything was spendy, but that's because it's luxurious. Couldn't have spent much more time, but we saved a ton on the first leg of our trip, so it evened everything out. 
Location was good for us as our friends lived just down the way, but not GREAT for people wanting to explore the main city. Need to taxi, but the taxi drivers are so great anyway. 

Can't wait to go back!",5,2015,05,14
206,Wow!,"Booked this hotel for my husbands birthday. The hotel is beautiful with modern and tasteful decor and although it's a ( pleasant )15 to 20 minute walk to Grafton street etc, the hotel itself is in a lovely vibrant location with great views around the canal and gave us a great opportunity to explore another part of Dublin. From the friendly doorman Barry who sorted out our car to Rachael on reception we had a lovely welcome to the Marker which gave a great first impression. The hotel room was  luxurious and spotless with great amenities from smart TVs to iPhone chargers and the beds were super comfortable. We had drinks out on the terrace ( would recommend for a sunny evening ), and I wish I could remember the names of the staff but all who were on the evening of May 13th were simply fab and very attentive. Food in the bar was delicious and the atmosphere very relaxing. I really could not fault this hotel, we were really looking forward to our stay and it did not disappoint! The only drawback was having to go home but we plan to return very soon! Thanks again to all the staff!",5,2015,05,14
206,Nice hotel,"Visited Dublin for 4 days in February and stayed at The Marker. The hotel itself is a very nice hotel, and the rooms are lovely. We only used the spa facilities once but wished we had used them more. The food was nice but overpriced for what you get and if you want to visit the Temple Bar area of Dublin and be in the thick of it it's approximately a 20 minute walk away. ",4,2015,05,14
206,How the other half live.,"Stayed in the Marker for my wife's birthday , we weren't disappointed. Really impressed with everything. Staff very helpful and pleasant. Hotel was spotless and everything worked as it should.Spa was very relaxing. Food was very good.Abit of a walk into the center but not too far , 20 mins or so.Around 6 or 7 euros in a taxi.Plenty of places near it for food to.Was up in the rooftop terrace but had to stay under cover because of the rain.Couldn't see too much. Can't blame the hotel for that!
Overall a really good time at the Marker, my only gripe is that I couldn't stay for longer.Will definitely return. ",5,2015,05,12
206,Needs to apply just a little more attention to detail,"Great friendly check-in service. We tried their breakfast, lunch and dinner menus and on each occasion excellent food was served. 
Arrived early, left bags and went out for lunch. Receptionist said she would call when room was ready. Room was upgraded from Superior Room to Corner Suite (actually a corner room) with views in two direction. At the official check-in time 3:00pm we were handed the keys to 234. The room was nice except one direction was closely and uncomfortably overlooked by the many staff in very nearby office block. 
A few minutes later two workmen arrived and said the ac had been reported as not working very well. We had only just arrived and as the temperature initially seemed ok we sent them away. After 20mins at the lowest setting the room was too stuffy and warm. A call to Accommodation Service said we should wait for at least 30mins to see if it cools down properly. At this class of hotel and at this room price the ac should have been running in advance of our arrival so the the room was cool and fresh on arrival. A/c was fixed but was too noisy for my partner who unlike me has very good hearing.  Even when the a/c was turned off the ventilation system was noisy but as we had unpacked we really couldn't be bothered to seek a room change. 
Other minor points:
Minibar had only three teabags. Bathroom had only enough bath/shower gel for one bath and one shower. Concierge gave us the wrong time to wait nearby to pick up the sightseeing tour bus and that left us hanging around for quite a while; information given should have been spot-on accurate. In the spa area on the mezzanine level I was not informed at the spa reception where I should go to collect a towel and irritatingly had to walk back there to get one.
At the breakfast buffet it was annoying that used plates were not alway removed from our table before we returned with plates of other items of food. I accept that these are small matters but in my opinion they let the hotel down.  
In summary, this is an excellent hotel with friendly staff and great food in a useful location. Attention to detail could be improved. We would however happily return here if the occasion presented itself again but the ventilation/ac system in our room would be the first thing we would have to check.  

",4,2015,05,12
206,Exceptional,"Exceptional professional service, cannot fault this hotel, we left ten minutes after booking for a meeting, came back an hour later and the room was cleaned again and they set the bed for sleep, facilities food and staff all lovely. Would highly recommend ",5,2015,05,11
206,Great hotel,"The Marker hotel is located in an area of Dublin that reminds me of Docklands in London: near water and surrounded by so many new buildings.  

The reception staff is very friendly and welcoming and they kept our requests for a quiet room towards the end of the building.  The room was large, with simple but elegant lines and huge windows towards the front of the building and the water.  In a cupboard we found complimentary water and tea/coffee making facilities.  The TV was large with lots of UK channels, so it was as if we did not leave London.  The bed  linen was very good quality and so were the towels and bathrobes.  

I found it a bit disappointing that neither the shower or the bath had an extender shower that us women like using, however their toiletries smell divine.  

The drive to the airport is just over 20 euros and if you want to reach the major museums in Dublin and visit further west I would not recommend walking as the 'in between' area is a bit funny.  A taxi can take you for around 10-15 euros and in some 10min.

The breakfast is 24 euros however is extremely varied and the staff is very helpful and friendly.  There are several eateries nearby and a supermarket if you want to stock on juice/water etc.",5,2015,05,11
206,Roof Top Bliss,"A trip to the Marker and particularly the roof top for food, wine and cocktails was eagerly awaited and did not disappoint! The attention and service received was impeccable! Our server Alan was brilliant, constantly refreshing our glasses and serving up some of the best food I've had in ages. The menu comprised of small plates of various treats and I can only say that it was a triumph. I had organised the venue for my girlfriend, her mother and some friends and they were so impressed with the setting, service and food and drink. Well done to all at the Marker. - A lovely day out topped by an amazing experience - rooftop bliss! ",5,2015,05,10
206,Wonderful stay,"We stayed in The Marker on a trip to Dublin over New Year's and absolutely loved it. The service was welcoming and attentive; the room was stylish, extremely comfortable and quiet; and the rooftop bar was fantastic. 

The hotel is set in a fairly good location with great views over Dublin: if you're going out in the city centre, it's certainly walkable, but perhaps a bit of a trek if you're going everywhere by foot. The only other issue is that it's a shame that such a modern and stylish hotel doesn't have quite as many tech features as some of its international counterparts - mounted speakers (rather than connecting to the tv) for instance.",5,2015,05,10
206,Cannot fault!!,"I cannot fault the marker, all staff were impeccable with their service from start to finish and made our stay memorable. I have already recommended to many friends. The room we had which was a deluxe had amazing views, a huge bed and luxury bathroom. We normally always hear noise in hotels but this is very well insulated. Room service is the best I've had. The only down point was the drunch lunch we had, really small portions (salad) for 15euro so I felt quite shocked when it arrived as it was a starter portion. Apart from this we will be back again!",5,2015,05,08
206,Up there with the best,"I did some research on trip advisor on which hotel to stay in, and it was well worth it. The location is a bit out of the way but there is a tram 5 mins away that will take you any were you need to go. The actual hotel is top draw the staff could not do enough for us, on our arrival we were upgraded to a larger room with a bathroom that was outstanding and had every thing you could possibly need from luxury soap to shaving kits.
Breakfast is as expected every thing you could wish for, all good quality food. Finally the spa is breath taking and only adds to the experience of staying. Brillaint hotel and great customer service",5,2015,05,07
206,Weekend city break,Our two night stay in The Marker Hotel was very pleasant indeed. The hotel lived up to all our expectations. The only minor fault would be the relatively limited clothes storage facilities in our room (unless we missed additional drawers/shelves of course). Aside from this minor detail we couldn't have enjoyed our stay any more. Our weekend in Dublin was greatly enhanced by both the hotel itself (the spa facilities in particular were impressive) and the staff who could not have been more helpful. Would highly recommend staying here whilst in Dublin.,5,2015,05,07
206,Fantastic Service - Great Hotel,"Really nice clean, functional and high quality Hotel in a great location. The finest part of the Hotel is however the Staff, nothings too much trouble. Wonderful. We wouldn't hesitate to return here on our next Visit to Dublin. I'd happily recommend this Hotel for Business or pleasure!",5,2015,05,06
206,Excellent hotel and great service,A lovely place to stay. Everyone really helpful at all times. Great cocktails! Beds very comfy and everything very clean and in good repair in the room.  We will be back again. This was our second visit .,5,2015,05,05
206,Excellent,"This is our second time staying at the Marker hotel and i could not fault it, the service is second to none. The staff are friendly and couldn't do enough to help and make our stay more enjoyable. Would definitely recommend.",5,2015,05,05
206,Great service in a great location,"My husband and I brought our one year old daughter here for a bank holiday treat. The Marker was great, extremely welcoming towards our little girl, making sure our every need was met. We paid a supplement for a view of the square and the canal which was worth it as it is lit up at night and we were spending the evening in the room. We used the pool and spa area which were both lovely, and immaculately clean. The service is what makes this hotel stand out. From the moment we booked, they were warm, friendly and quick to respond whenever we had a request. I am docking one star for the price of breakfast in the morning, even though it was delicious. It was - put simply- overpriced. In all other respects, this hotel is well worth a look.",4,2015,05,04
206,Short Stay Long Memories,"The Marker Hotel in Dublin is a wonderful place to stop whether on a short stay or for a longer holiday.  Lovely decor, great spacious rooms and finally a hotel that gets the right temperature in the room without the sound of the air con whirring all night!!!  I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for anyone thinking of taking a trip to Dublin.  The staff are attentive and professional.  The Spa and indoor pool wonderful and if the sun does come out!!....The Rooftop Bar gives great views with the sea on one side and the mountains on the other.",5,2015,05,04
206,"Great value, chic location away from the crowds","This hotel was a great value in a cool, slightly off-the-beaten-path Dublin area in the Docklands. Very accessible to the city center, but more modern and updated than a lot of the other options we saw. Overall a great place to stay and quicker to get to from the airport.",5,2015,05,04
206,A perfect weekend in The Marker,"My boyfriend and I spent one night in Dublin over the bank holiday weekend, and this hotel turned out to be the highlight of our stay.
When we checked into our room, it was large, clean and spacious, with one of the best bathrooms I have come across. We also noticed that though our room did not have a view of the adjacent canal, effort had been made to create a water feature in the centre of the hotel so the view from our window was still pretty. 
From the moment we checked in to the minute we left this hotel, all the staff went out of their way to ensure we were enjoying our trip. We were given complimentary umbrellas when we headed out in to the rain and were even provided with bottles of water for our journey back to the airport. When we needed a taxi to take us out for an evening meal, the reception staff were more than happy to organise this for us whilst we enjoyed a drink in the bar.
As far as the hotel facilities are concerned, we were very impressed. Unfortunately on the first day we spent in Dublin it rained all day long, however this was not a problem as it meant we had time to make full use of the hotels spa facilities. Again, these were modern and clean, as well as being quiet so we could enjoy some relaxation before heading out in the evening. Towels, robes and slippers were all provided (both in the rooms and the spa) so we really felt as though we were being looked after.
The hotel also has a rooftop bar which was lovely to enjoy a drink on before heading into the town - especially when the sun came out!
In terms of location, the hotel is about a 15 minute walk into the centre of Dublin (about 5 minutes in a taxi) which was absolutely perfect for us.
I do not usually write reviews about hotels, but my boyfriend and I were so impressed with this trip that I felt I had to!
I will be reccommending this hotel to anyone going to Dublin in future!",5,2015,05,03
206,"Lots of Space, good location",Right in the heart of the tech area - was able to walk to work. I was also impressed with the modern bathroom and overall amount of space in the room. I was able to relax and take a bath - and there was no noise at all to keep me up at night.,5,2015,05,03
206,Anniversary weekend,"I have enjoyed top hotels around the world and this is high on the list of enjoyment 
The rooms are superb and the hotel has a great vibe about it 
If you want to feel relaxed and indulge yourself then this has to your first choice in Dublin",5,2015,05,03
206,Spa and afternoon tea,"Had an amazing spa and afternoon tea at this hotel. The staff were really helpful, everything I asked for had been organised and the spa was gorgeous. All of the girls (there was 8 of us) loved their treatments and my massage was one of the best I have ever had!",5,2015,05,02
206,Perfect!,Beautiful modern hotel in a stunning location with exceptional views over the city from the rooftop bar. Didn't have dinner here however the buffet breakfast was amazingly high quality. Definitely will be back for more.....especially when the weather gets a bit better üåû,5,2015,05,01
206,Wouldn't be top on our list of hotels worth returning to,"My family and I stayed here in February this year for 1 night and would not be in any rush back.   The main reason we selected this hotel for our family get-together was to make use of the rooftop terrace bar in the evening, after coming back from a play in The Olympia.   However, this bar was not open and we were told it wouldn't be until April.  This was very disappointing as we had heard a lot about it & the lovely views you have of Dublin from here.  The opening dates should be clearly indicated when guests go to make a booking.   In addition, we had booked 1 x superior twin room and 2 x superior king rooms.  My Mum and I checked in to our twin room with no issues.  However, when one of my sisters went to check in she was not given her king room and was told none was available.  She was given a twin room and was advised she could pay extra for a corner king room if she wanted.  Luckily, we had our booking details with us, which she produced and in the end she was provided a king room at no extra cost.   My other sister had no issues when checking in.   Also, we did not like the breakfast seating area which is to the left of the ‚ÄúQueue Here to Be Seated‚Äù standing area.  There should be a divider of sorts here as you have no privacy whatsoever.  Quite a number of people can be standing here sometimes, while they wait for a free table and they are only a foot away from you if you are sitting on the bench couch side.   We could not fault the breakfast itself.  There was plenty of choice.   When checking out I was asked if I had used the Valet Car Parking facility and I advised I had no car with me.  However, I was still charged for parking on my final bill which is not cheap at ‚Ç¨20 (I think).  I had to ask the Receptionist to remove this charge and print me out a new,  correct receipt.  Overall, the hotel rooms we had were modern, spacious, clean and comfortable, including the bathrooms but we wouldn't class the Bar & Reception area as particularly comfortable.   The prices for food and drink are very high in this hotel (even in the mini bar) but this was expected for such a hotel in Dublin city. One last thing to note - the constant questions from the bell boys is annoying.  If I am standing with my case in front of the Reception Desk, it is clear I am waiting to either check in or check out.  I do not need to be asked this and then be told a Receptionist will be with me shortly.  It is a tad too much attention for me and other family members.  There are many other hotels we look forward to trying out in Dublin, next time.   That is the beauty of large cities, plenty of choice!",3,2015,05,01
206,Hotel makes a great catch and dive!,"We arrived mid afternoon after a long drive to be told our room was not ready .Apparently an event the previous evening had resulted in slow departures which does happen.On being asked by a vigilant manager were we ok,I responed not really!Once he understood our situation (attending an event at 7.30 as well as having dinner before hand),he immediately upgraded us and had coffee delivered to an excellent room which he escorted us to.Hotel very good with great facilities and the roof top bar was a big hit despite the inclement weather.friendly and attentive staff.",5,2015,04,30
206,"Nice Hotel , Great Location","Stayed One Night , check in was quick and the staff are very friendly.  The room was very spacious and clean with all mod cons.  The leisure facilities are very good.  Breakfast was average, there was cereal, fruits and hot buffet breakfast, however expected more from a 5 star hotel.  The location is great, restaurants and bar are plentiful and it about 15-20 walk to city centre",4,2015,04,28
206,"Spa, Staff and Service all faultless","We had a fanatic stay here and the staff including those at the spa went out of their way to accommodate every request including getting flowers, strawberries and wine on arrival. Our stay went without a hitch and in particular we enjoyed the room service and breakfast. The masseuse (Luh) was very knowledgeable and gave the best maternity massage my wife has ever had.",5,2015,04,28
206,Very Enjoyable Stay,We stayed at The Marker for 3 nights in a deluxe room overlooking the Bord Gais Theater.  The hotel is very sleek and the rooms were comfortable and very clean.  The main restaurant served a number of local dishes for dinner with great service.  There is a bar on the roof with excellent views of the surrounding area.  It was a bit cold when we were there but I can imagine that it is the place to be in the summer.  There is a nice gym and spa at the hotel.  The location is a bit away from the main tourist sights but we did not have issues with walking and the cabs were not expensive when it started to rain.  If you are looking for a modern/trendy hotel in Dublin this is the place for you.  I would definitely stay here again.,4,2015,04,27
206,Excellent hotel,"I liked  my week in this hotel.
The food was excellent, the staff was helpful and kindless, the room was beautiful, charming and modern, the noise was magical, options was ridiculous, th√© landscape was fenomenal, the activity was historical, but the price was very disapointed.",3,2015,04,27
206,"Stylish, modern city base with great service","Stayed here for one night in January. The hotel is smart, stylish and design-orientated. Rooms and lobby have bold colour schemes and bathrooms are particularly luxurious with large baths and showers, high-quality toiletries and plenty of complimentary goodies. Comfortable - and large - bed made for a good night's sleep. I had mentioned I was there for a birthday and we received a birthday plate, with a note from the manager, which was a nice touch. The spa facilities are also good - the pool and jacuzzi are a good size, with steam room etc. The doormen were also particularly helpful about tips for dinner, visits. Would highly recommend.",5,2015,04,27
206,Stylish Dublin stay...,"Love the Marker hotel. It's my more stylish home from home with lovely staff, a warm atmosphere, great views and wonderful food. Highly recommend this gem of a hotel which is located in the Grand Canal area of Dublin. Next door to the best theatre in town, the Bord Gais energy theatre and beside some super eateries and bars.",5,2015,04,27
206,A good Hotel,"A good hotel near the Congress Centre of Dublin and in a good position for going to / coming from the airport. Service, rooms and reception are excellent (in particular, friendly). The hotel is modern and has its own style that may be more or less appreciated but that certainly is remarkable.",5,2015,04,27
206,well worth a visit,"What a lovely hotel staffed by very friendly staff   rooms are excellent thick luxurious carpets and excellent spa and fitness centre bedrooms very good 
would definitely go again   rooms cost more if you book on the day so book in advance for a bargain",5,2015,04,26
206,I want to stay at the Marker again,"I stayed 3 nights in November and 8 nights in December 2014 on business. I travelled directly from New Zealand. I needed to rest and be able to concentrate on the case I was working on so I didn't want to be distracted by the workings of the hotel. The Marker delivered. The hotel is modern and slick. I went to the gym everyday and liked it. Breakfast was superb. The staff at all points were helpful and courteous on both stays. The room was quiet, substantial and I was able to rest. I was near to everything I wanted. The walk to the city was fine. I am determined to come back to Ireland with my wife and will definitely stay at the Marker at my own cost.",5,2015,04,26
206,Overnight,"Quick overnight stay
Stayed here last night. The staff couldn't have been more helpful. We had a light dinner in the pm which was basic and only average. We had gone to the rooftop for cocktails earlier and had a lovely monitor and glass of wine. It was windy and cold and we were underdressed. The overhead heaters were on and blankets were available to keep you warm. I'm afraid it was not my scene. On a warm night I'm sure it would be lovely. It's definitely different. There is an infinity pool on the mezzanine floor which is lovely and worth a quick visit. Breakfast was disappointing. We were surprised that breakfast was 24.50 extra on top of the huge price charged for the room. Breakfast should have been included. The coffee was week and my poached eggs and bacon were only Luke warm. Hot breakfasts should be ordered and brought to clients fresh and hot. Hot buffet breakfasts have no place in 5 star hotels. There was no white bread of any description available this am. The rooms are lovely but unfortunately reading a paper is impossible as there is no reading light in the room. Some rooms have no view as was ours. ",4,2015,04,25
206,Relax at The Marker,"We went to a concert in the 3Arena and booked The Marker for the night. Relax Unwind in luxury. We were upgraded to a suite as we were celebrating a birthday and our anniversary and found a tray of treats left in the room for us. From the reservation to our departure the hotel staff were excellent. The room the bed the pillows pure comfort the shower was like a waterfall. The breakfast was great too. 

We definitely will return to The Marker and I highly recommend it for couples for families and convenient for the 3Arena.",5,2015,04,23
206,Marvellous Marker,We love this hotel and always look forward to being looked after so well by the lovely staff. The location is fabulous.   The view from the rooftop bar is amazing over the city.  The bedrooms are of a very high standard.  The food is delicious and there are other good restaurants in that area.  There is a nice 20 minute walk to Grafton Street.,5,2015,04,23
206,Appreciate the Services delivered,The overall cleanliness and service from the entire staff was much appreciated. All the staff has been very friendly throughout my stay. When staying for an extended period a variety of food options would be nice.,4,2015,04,21
206,"Beautiful, modern, great service","This modern, clean luxurious hotel is in the modern section of Dublin across the square from a major theater.  Very quiet, beautiful and clean and the staff cannot do enough to please you.  It is a bit of a walk from Temple Arms, however, I love to walk, so it was not a problem.   I highly recommend.",5,2015,04,20
206,Excellent Hotel!,"Everything was flawless. The hotel has a beautiful, modern design, spacious rooms, flawless service, and a great location, although not in the old city center. Some rooms have poor cell phone coverage. That's something you might want to point out in your reservation.",5,2015,04,20
206,"Bad Breakfast en pillows, very friendly staff.","It doesn't have the best location, expect to take taxis anywhere worth seeing.
The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The pillows were awful and we slept bad. Housekeeping woke us up at 8 am on the first day asking when we would like our room cleaned. 

The breakfast was a royal rip off: 25 euro per person, with extra charge for anything like fresh fruit juice (OJ was included). Not even ham on the buffet - for 25 euro we expect more than salami as the only cold cut. Their lunch menu was decent. ",3,2015,04,20
206,Calm and cool,"Went for 1 night.  The room was large and well appointed and bed was very comfy, but what was really nice was the silence.  No banging doors from other rooms, no voices in the corridors, just a beautiful oasis of calm.",5,2015,04,19
206,Almost there...,"I was attending a show in the Grand Canal Theatre (Bord Gais Energy Theatre) and decide to stay in the Marker Hotel. The Marker is one of Dublin‚Äôs newest hotels and is a member of the LHW group, so I had high expectations.
The hotel itself is located direct beside the theatre on Grand Canal dock, on the unfortunately named Misery Hill street. This area over the last 10 years has seen huge changes with the theatre, hotel, bars and restaurants setting up. It was great to see this area receive some much needed attention. As a location, it is also within walking distance of the IFSC area of Dublin and the Three Arena. I would say that it is a short taxi ride into the city center as I wouldn‚Äôt fancy walking it. If you do it would take about 25 minutes of a stroll. 
The hotel itself is a ultra-contemporary structure which fits in well beside the equally contemporary theatre. On arrival I found the staff to be welcoming and friendly. The area to the right as you enter the lobby is the bar area, which seems a little chaotic at times. There is a roof top bar which is seasonal and obviously weather dependent.
Rooms are long and narrow but of a standard size you‚Äôd expect in a city hotel. Half of the rooms face the canal, so request 1 prior to arriving if you would like a view.  My room was clean, crisp with a deco that suited the hotel brand. Room have AC, which is not too common in Ireland, but very much needed. 
Over the course of my stay I did encounter a few customer service issues, which are difficult to believe considering the price and brand of the hotel. However these can happen anywhere and how the hotel deals with these complaints is how I rate the overall service. The manager I spoke with was very pleasant and dealt with my issues in a very prompt and professional manner. This was followed up with a personal mail after I returned home. 
The hotel also boast a stunning infinity style pool with is a rarely in a city center hotel. The pool area is haven of calm with soothing dark deco and spa music playing.. The area also hosts a large Jacuzzi, sauna and steam room. I did have a treatment in the spa and the service provided was top class.
Overall the Marker is the new kid on the block and a definite contender to other 4/5 stars in the city. My experience was one of contrasts from the chaotic area of the bar to the peace of the pool and spa area. Its nestled ideally for the theatre, Three arena and financial area of the city. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll enjoy your visit and in the coming years I expect that the Marker will grow in popularity.",4,2015,04,19
206,Day trip to Dublin,"The hotel was impressive and the staff was very helpful with all requests and proximity to shopping and food was just right! It was one of the best breakfast buffets we have and we have had them from Rome, Denmark, London, New Zealand just to name a few!
              
              ",5,2015,04,16
206,Marker is fabulous!,"If you want an absolutely wonderful, reasonable hotel that personifies professionalism, graciousness, service, beauty, then you want the Marker. We are here currently for a business summit and have been treated like royalty. Actually I thought they had me mixed up with someone else, the treatment has been so grand. The staff is beyond polite and friendly, they go out of their way to make sure you are taken care of in the nicest way. 
I can't sing the praises of this hotel enough. We have conferences all over the world and they include some 2000 people. That amount can try anyone's patience but the Marker staff just keep going above and beyond. The hotel itself is so pretty, wait until you place your feet on the heated bathroom floor. The huge bathroom is all in marble and is the size of a normal living room, very large.
I can honestly say this has been the best stay in a hotel outside the US. Fabulous!",5,2015,04,15
206,Mark marked Marker,"We spent 3 nights at the Marker Hotel near the city center in Dublin. At our arrival there was some problem with the reservation beacuse of the travel agency, but Robert and Unni, the manager were more than professional and kind to solve the problem. So after the first excellent impression we had a comfortable, quiet and very nice room. I like very much nice and big bathrooms, I was really satisfied with ours. 
Once we had breakfast in the hotel, Elena was really helpful, Mark, my son appreciated her kindness. Breakfast is perfect, huge choice, good ambiance. Also we had once a dinner in brasserie, where my osobucco could get a michelin star. I must notice also Ferenc and Mathieu's professionalism who served the food and wine with such a big smile and humour. The SPA is correct, just enough after a walking/visiting day in Dublin. We had also opportunity to rent a bicycle to ride to the port. Bartos kindly helped to my son. 
Our last memorable time was spent on the roofterrace, what Andreas opened for us to see the view. He was also very kind, lovely and after in the bar very professional. 
We loved our little journey and there is no question that we will still return and offer this hotel to our friends. Congratulations, good job! Nomen est omen, we marked Marker!üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ",5,2015,04,14
206,Pricey but 5 Star Experience,"Loved our stay here. We got tickets to see Jersey Boys in the Bord Gais and wanted a place nearby, well you couldn't be closer unless you had a sleeping bag outside the door. Striking design, fantastic staff, great facilities. Everything catered for before you could think of it. We even got to meet a couple of the stars of Jersey Boys (and spotted a couple other celebs) in the hotel bar. My only qualm was my room curtain didn't reach all the way over to the end so in the morning my room was quite bright, which I don't like, but that's a minor detail.",5,2015,04,14
206,Special weekend,"The hotel was beautiful, rooms , food, Staff, outside area. everything was great, except the bar/ coffee lounge service which was extremely slow. thought the hotel quite expensive.  It was a special birthday weekend with friends otherwise we would have went for a less expensive hotel.",4,2015,04,13
206,Luxury concert visit,"We chose the hotel because of its proximity to the 3 Arena.  Our stay was brilliant, right from our arrival where a lovely guy took our car to the car park.  Check in was really quick and we went straight to our room.  The corridors to the room were lovely and dark with a really luxurious feel.  The room was pretty big, with nice furniture, immaculately clean and nicely presented. The bed was amazing and I really loved the toiletries which were beautiful.  We had time for a meal in the bar which was lovely although the service was a bit on the slow side. We were taken to the concert in the hotel courtesy car by a most pleasant guy who said if we needed him to pick us up to call the hotel.  This was a really nice touch and certainly made us feel very special. Breakfast was brilliant, we had so much to choose from. The melon bowl had just emptied and the waitress noticed me looking at it, next thing without saying anything I was brought a whole plate full to my table. We had poached  eggs cooked to order along with bacon and all the usual bits. I would definitely recommend a visit, I know we will be back.",5,2015,04,12
206,5 Star Experience,"Our family of 4 stayed in two rooms for 4 nights.  Excellent choice!  Great clean and quiet rooms. Our rate included breakfast and we looked forward to it every morning.  Location is a bit out of the way, but our goal was to see Dublin and we certainly saw it all. Staff was very informative and accommodating. Used the gym and spa and had cocktails outdoors on a lovely spring day. As we were leaving for airport, they forgot to give one of our bags that was in storage (and we didn't immediately notice!).  Upon realizing their error they sent a taxi with the bag to meet us at airport at their expense.  Class act!",5,2015,04,12
206,Great stay ,This was the second time we stayed in The Marker and it was just as pleasant. Staff even allowed us to check in early after arriving in from an early flight into Dublin Airport. Food was fantastic. I cannot wait to come back during the summer months to make use of the rooftop bar. ,5,2015,04,12
206,One night Easter weekend stay,"the hotel is lovely, modern and luxurious, but our stay was very disappointing as although it was Easter weekend, the hotel restaurant was shut (no reason given) and the rooftop terrace bar was also shut (no reason given). we had planned a special evening with dinner but had to eat an average bar snack in their busy public bar area, and the service was poor.",3,2015,04,11
206,Another Great Stay,"we had such a great experience the last few times that we wanted to treat ourselves for our anniversary. 
The entire staff were so helful organising every single detail for the trip, I cant thank them enough.
cant wait to go back!",5,2015,04,10
206,Great location and very high level of service!,"Stayed with g/f for her birthday in April 2015 and had a great stay. Valet parking at the front, shown in and bags taken to room. Check in was very smooth with great staff. Inside of hotel was absolutely fantastic - d√©cor and finish all great. Room was huge with 8ft bed, bathroom suite all Villeroy and Boch and shower was big enough for about 6 people! 
Reception staff recommended places for us to visit and gave us a map to help us find our way around. 
We enquired about the roof bar on arrival but were told that it was closed for refurb. Was slightly disappointed as this was one of the selling points for this hotel although they did offer to take us up to get a few photos etc. 
The food options are the casual bar or the brasserie restaurant. The brasserie looked lovely but most of the menu was fish or steak and lacked a chicken dish, leaving g/f with little on offer that she would eat. The bar menu did look good for burgers etc but we were looking for something more than bar food so we went to a nice little restaurant across the road and came back to the Marker for drinks and dessert after.
The following morning we took a walk around the quay where there were lots of nice little healthy food options. We got breakfast here and ate it outside in the seated area in the sun. We also stocked up on a salad bowl picnic lunch to take to the zoo.
Checkout was again very smooth and valet parking brought car back to meet us stocked with water for the journey.
In terms of location the Market has a great location on the quay - about 5 min walk to O2 arena, 20 mins to Grafton street, 30mins to Henry street and 45 mins to the Guinness factory where we did the tour. 
The interior and service in the hotel were both 5star and we will definitely be back again. The only slight negatives we had were the lack of chicken on the brasserie menu and the roof bar being closed but both were minor and the positives far out weighed these areas. Didn't get to try the spa or gym as we were only staying 1 night but both look to be up to the same standard as the rest of the hotel.
Highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a high quality hotel with very helpful staff in a great location.",4,2015,04,10
206,Good but not great.,"This hotel has the potential to be truly amazing, but a few things left me wanting more.

Check-in was a little tedious as our room was not ready, we waited 15 minutes at the lobby before being asked to wait in the bar area, with a complimentary drink offered to us. We were told that our room would be ready momentarily. Waited 15 minutes to be served in what i thought was a not very busy time of day for the bar team.

Waiter did not understand that our drink was complimentary and told us he would speak to someone. 

After waiting for around an hour, i went back to reception to check on our room availability, to be served by the same member of the reception team, she appeared to not even recall our previous encounter. Handed me a key and that was that. Not the best start to our Marker experience.

The staff were incredibly attentive, but almost to the extent of being a little tedious.

The spa & pool facilities are up there with the best i have experienced, infinity pool, sauna, steam room & jacuzzi were all wonderful, with the addition of 'child hours' this allows you the option to go to the pool when it is child-free. 

The concierge team were fantastic, helping me arrange restaurant bookings on each night, i would especially like to thank Robert for his assistance.",4,2015,04,10
206,What a place!,"We booked the hotel for a weekend break in Dublin, and whilst I'm not bothered about hotels as I only see them as a bed for the night, I was thoroughly impressed by the Marker. The staff are incredible. SO friendly, SO helpful! They helped us pick places to go, things to see and helped us with issues with a smile so wide it made you feel so special. The room is spacious, and the bathroom was beautiful. The beds were a little hard for me, but I don't think thats much of an issue. They left a cake in our room as a welcome and the staff were constantly in contact with us for bookings we asked them to make us. It's easy to walk from the hotel to the center of town and the area surrounding the hotel makes for a beautiful space to relax. The food is a little pricey, so we ate all our meals including breakfast at cafes surrounding the hotel. There's also a gym that all guests can use, and a spa which has a great selection of treatments. Would definitely stay there again!",5,2015,04,09
206,A once in a lifetime experience!,"The Marker hotel was our first stop in our Honeymoon trip to Ireland, and what an experience that was! the Hotel is amazing, starting from its' wonderful helpful caring staff to the deluxe rooms, the cleanness and the luxury of every single detail of our stay. Despite having a bad luck with the luggage arriving late, the hotel and staff made our stay so wonderful!
We stayed at the Marker Hotel for 4 nights and all we can say is WOW! Amazing on every level! a truly luxurious experience.",5,2015,04,08
206,"very modern, fantastic decor, great cleanliness, comfy bed!!","Beautiful hotel over looking the water in Dublin. Was my first trip to Dublin but I am very happy about where we chose to stay. 
The restaurant and food looked great however we were only there shortly so went out to eat elsewhere. 

I would gladly return to stay here again. 

The room was great and the bed was huge, and sooooo comfy. 
The bathroom was also huge, had a lovely modern shower and bath and was another wow factor. 

The SPA was AMAZING !!!!",5,2015,04,08
206,"""Wow!""","Stayed here for 2 nights with my daughters. Beautiful hotel & friendly staff. My daughters & I enjoyed the pool and hot tub. Extremely clean - loved the fresh fruit, tea and lemon water available in spa. Room was spacious & very comfortable. Enjoyed the heated floors in the bathroom. A little bit of a walk to the center of Dublin, but other than that, absolutely no complaints. We would definitely recommend!!",5,2015,04,07
206,Staff couldn't do enough to help...,"Hotel is a little out of town... But don't be put off, the air coach (from Dublin airport) drops off and picks up 2 minutes from the hotel (you want the Maldron Hotel stop on the 702 service to Greystones).  Also the Dublin tour bus goes from the same stop. You can get a 2 day pass for ‚Ç¨20 which will take you straight into the centre of the city and back again. You can use the same pass to get around Dublin and see all of the sights. Alternatively the walk to the city is 20 minutes and you can even take the scenic route along The River Liffey.

The hotel itself is gorgeous. Spacious room and modern bathroom with a full mini bar service and lots of wardrobe room. The beds are super comfy and there is a full wifi service in the room and lobby area (complimentary as you would expect).

The staff were amazing, they couldn't do enough to help you. 

The view from the rooftop bar is a must see. However it's not always open so check in advance. The view is not to be missed especially at sunset.

206,A brilliant experience!!,"I stayed here for one night with my 2 daughters as we were going to see The Jersey Boys at Bord Gais. From the minute we arrived we were made to feel special from the welcome we got from the concierge to the receptionist (I think her name was Rachael).The room was really nice spacious,spotless with all you needed.We went to the spa to use the pool and Jacuzzi.The atmosphere here was peaceful and again staff friendly and helpful. I had booked the trip as part of my daughter's  birthday present and we received a lovely plate of cake to the room which was delicious! My daughter had lost a ring and we left a note for the ladies cleaning the room to look out for it.We received a phone call to say it hadn't been found but it has since turned up at home.I can't rate this hotel highly enough and would recommend it as one of the top hotels in Ireland.Will definitely be back!!",5,2015,04,07
206,Favourite hotel in Ireland!,"We went down to the Marker Hotel for a night over Easter and have to say, there isn't one thing that isn't just flawless about this place.

It's our 3rd time there and we will definitely be back in summer!",5,2015,04,06
206,Easter at the Marker,"Just checked in en famille to a corner suite here at The Marker on Grand Canal Quay
Had Le Drunch downstairs in the Brasserie and waiting on our eldest daughter to take cocktails on the Roof Bar.
Service so far excellent, check in seamless and room plush and would heartily recommend it and just next door to the Bord Gais Energy Theatre.

Book it today!!!",5,2015,04,05
206,Dublin at its finest,"This a very new hotel and the d√©cor certainly reflects this. Very modern but also with lots of character. The staff were very friendly and certainly add to the overall feeling of quality. The room, a superior delux, was lovely, great selection of entertainment on the tv, room service was excellent and the wifi was complimentary and quick. It was about a 15 minute walk along the Liffey to get to Temple Bar and some other attraction, the Guinness Storehouse, for example 20 minutes further on but the taxis are very reasonable so being slightly further out of the centre isn't a problem. All in all a cracking hotel and well worth the cost.",5,2015,04,05
206,5* star,"check in , fast efficient and very polite and helpful.Although we were very early we were checked in and shown to our room straight away(thank you Nina)..Very spacious,modern room with a lovely view.Bathroom much bigger than one would expect.The spa area and pool were beautiful and again run by very friendly staff.Overall the place is spotless. breakfast was a fine affair with anything you could possibly need.Did not get to use the rooftop bar as it was not open until the following day.Will definitely be back",5,2015,04,05
206,The guest is king!,Probably not the Markers target group - pensioners using their free travel passes to go to Dublin by train and see a show in the Bord Gais Theatre. Booked as a treat and it was. Beautiful rooms comfy bed and luxurious bathroom. Extra stars for the lovely big wash hand basin. Staff were absolutely lovely and kindly found us a seat in the very crowded bar so that we could have something to eat. Pool jacuzzi and steam room were all very clean and well equipped - really enjoyed this as the weather was awful. Breakfast was was wonderful. When leaving I told the receptionist that my meal the previous evening had not been good. I was taken seriously and and a manager removed the meal charge from the bill and apologised. That means we definitely want to stay in the Marker again since everything else had been perfect and it also convinced me that this was an exceptional hotel which regards every customer as important.   Thank you to all the staff in the Marker - you are exceptional.,5,2015,04,05
206,Beautiful modern hotel near the heart of Dublin!,"We stayed here two nights. Our room was large and beautifully furnished.  The room and hotel have an ultra-modern feel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room we stayed in had a beautiful canal view.  This hotel had the best wi-fi of any place we stayed in Europe. Each TV in every room functions as a hot spot. It's brilliant, and worked great. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,04,04
206,"Great room, nice area.","Very nice contemporary hotel. Bright roomy bathroom with heated floors, bath tub and glass shower area. A little irritating is the fact that it was impossible to suppress the fan, even when I set it to off on thermostat. So there is always low humming noise on background.",5,2015,04,04
206,AmazingHotel!!!,"So from the moment we entered the hotel... We could tell we were going to have a fantastic stay! We were greeted at the door and our bags taken straight off us and put in the hold. The polish national team were staying in the hotel and were more than happy to have a few snaps taken. Our room was upgraded free of charge and a happy birthday cake delivered to the room which was a lovely touch! Staff couldn't be more helpful inparticular Mark who works in the resturant. He went above and beyond of what he needed to do and made the stay even more special. Thank you Mark. Room service was quick and a good selection of foods, the breakfast was top quality with a variety of different foods to choose from and the spa topped off our stay! We will 100% be coming back to this hotel as its luxurious, classy and still close to the city shops and pubs. Till next time...",5,2015,04,02
206,Wonderful Stay!,"Fantastic hotel in a neat neighborhood!  

Service:  Top Notch, made me feel like I was the most important customer in their hotel.  They really went the extra mile for me.  If you forgot it, they find it for you.

Rooms:  Beautiful, very clean, excellent bathrooms, comfortable beds.

Truly one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in.  Highly recommended!",5,2015,04,01
206,Possibly the best hotel I've ever stayed in!,"I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. 

I booked this hotel as a surprise gift for my girlfriend‚Äôs mum‚Äôs 60th birthday as she had never been to Ireland. I arranged the chauffer service from the airport for that extra 5* touch which was great and recommend to you. Less hassle and fuss from the airport with taxis of busses. All the staff were amazing. Always doing everything to possible to make our stay that little bit extra special, which is I‚Äôm sure the reason why we‚Äôll be back. The driver was brilliant and chatted to us all the way to the hotel and had loads of recommendations for our time in Dublin. The manager was at the door to great us and showed us up to our room ‚Äì He recommended a beautiful Italian restaurant just out of the city, which would have never found without him. They even arranged the restaurant booking and travel arrangements for us. If you ring ahead of your trip and talk with the reception about your stay they will endeavour to make your welcome extra special. No request was too much trouble‚Ä¶ from the airport pick up to small additional welcome items in the room on request.  

The rooms were big and spacious and had everything you needed. Being a bit of a gadget geek I really loved the interactive TV with all our booking in formation on screen/on demand music/internet and message centre. 

The spa area was just something else. I popped in early afternoon and had the place all to myself. The pool is so relaxing; the sauna and steam rooms were brilliant. I think I actually fell asleep in the Jacuzzi listening to the tranquil music. There were treatment rooms and a fully equipped gym available too which I didn‚Äôt have time to use but will in future. 

The bar area was so friendly and inviting. We had several drinks in the bar area before heading out for our evening meal and a couple on return. The bar staff were very attentive and quick with our drinks. 

The brasserie restaurant was top notch. We only had our breakfast here but it was marvellous. As a person who loves a good breakfast I have to say this was excellent. The Market had everything I could ask for. Even though everything was self-serve the restaurant staff were constantly bringing additional toast, tea and coffee, if you were looking like you were to running low. 

All in all the best hotel experience I have had. Due in no small part to every staff member I spoke with before and during our trip. The hotel is truly 5* but the staff are what push it over the top for me and are the reason we‚Äôll be going back very soon.

206,Amazing hotel,Wow this hotel is a must if staying in dublin great customer service brilliant staff. The rooms are amazing so fancy and posh I felt like royalty when I stayed here. I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting dublin. Definitely the best hotel I have ever stayed in.,5,2015,03,30
206,Chic modern hotel,"I stayed at the Marker for a business trip and was very pleased with this hotel.  It is a new, modern hotel with an amazing spa and indoor pool facilities.  The staff is great and attentive to any needs or requests.  The restaurant and bar area is also very nice.  The rooms are large and have huge marble bathrooms.  Too bad I didn't have time to use the large tub.  The hotel is located in a newly developed part of town that is on the water.  It is a short taxi or tram ride to the city center.  I highly recommend the Marker Hotel.",5,2015,03,30
206,Amazing!!!,"This is a beautiful hotel! The staff were all really friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. The room was amazing!!!! The view from our room was superb. 
The hotel reception and bar area was lovely and was a nice atmosphere to have a few drinks before going out for the evening. 
Pool and leisure facilities were really relaxing. 
Would love to come back one day soon!!",5,2015,03,30
206,My favorite hotel in Dublin!,"This is my favorite hotel in Dublin - and one of the best hotel experiences anywhere. Rooms are very nice, stylish, modern, clean. Beds comfortable. Very nice and professional service and staff. And I love their pool, great for swimming, relaxing - design and music make a wonderful atmosphere (especially when you are the only one there in early morning or evening). I like the dock area outside, the hotel is next to the water and close to many offices and the conference center. Close enough to the shopping and pub area, where you could take the bike, train or even walk to. 
The only thing I am not a fan of is that you cannot open the windows. But even when you turn off the air condition (at least in MArch ;-)) the room had a comfortable temperature - not too warm and not too cold.
I always love coming back.",5,2015,03,30
206,Nice place but not the Sunday best.,"Excellent location if you are at an event in the theatre opposite but otherwise I'd look nearer the city centre.  We visited on a Sunday, the show we were going to was cancelled & we found the surrounding area was like the Marie Celeste after 6pm & the only dining option was the hotel restaurant which was less than intimate for a special occasion meal. Coming back from the city centre were we ate ( One Pico - delicious) we attempted to visit the famed roof top bar only to be told it was closed due to a private event - something I feel reception could have alerted us to earlier. Rooms were comfortable though but have to say I won't be rushing back.",3,2015,03,29
206,Uber cool hotel with buzzing Cosmo. Atomsphere,Great addition to the Grand Canal Dock. Always buzzing with a healthy mix of locals tourists business and theatre goers. Design is chic modern and the city benefits from this beautiful hotel.,5,2015,03,26
206,Went her for my husbands 40th,Beautiful hotel.  Staff very attentive.  Really enjoyed our stay here. A bit pricey but I believe you get what you pay for.  Ideally situated in a beautiful part of Dublin.  When making the reservation Stephan promised a nice room and we weren't disappointed.,5,2015,03,25
206,Luxury!!!!,"Very friendly staff, quirky hotel, beautiful spa area and different but fabulous cocktails!only 15 minutes walk to the centre or grab a bus for under ‚Ç¨2!have been and will continue to highly recommend it!!!",5,2015,03,25
206,Incredible from start to finish!,"I booked The Marker as a fairly last minute deal through booking.com (¬£595 for 2 people 4 nights fyi) and I honestly could not have chosen a better hotel. From the first moment we arrived to the moment we left the staff bent over backwards to ensure that we were perfectly looked after. 
The rooms and bathrooms were beautifully presented and absolutely immaculate. The beds (we stayed in a superior king room) were absolutely huge and very comfortable, and the extensive collection of teas and complimentary waters etc in the room were a very nice touch. We only ate out 2 of the 4 nights we were there, the first of these evenings was on recommendation from the concierge and was a fabulous restaurant on a  boat on the Liffey. We ordered room service twice, and were very pleased to see that not only was there a brilliant selection, it was fabulously well cooked, not too pricey and served 24 hours a day. 
We also took advantage of the bar in the evening, dining and enjoying cocktails on our last night. Both the food and cocktails were absolutely brilliant but our evening was made by our very kind waiter Sean (who usually works on the rooftop bar) who offered to take us up to see it as the view was incredible and it's currently closed until April. This little added touch at the end of the holiday honestly made the whole trip for us. 
I wouldn't hesitate to go back to The Marker at all - honestly the best hotel I've ever stayed in and I'm actually on countdown now until I can go back again. Fabulous.",5,2015,03,23
206,Great Hotel,"Staying here currently for business and it's a really nice place.  Quick review:

Reception - nice, easy, informative
Room - Nice, clean, modern styling (not my fav, but to each their own).  The only thing I don't like is that the shower is basically part of the room so sometimes you get some run off from the shower into the rest of the bathroom, but that is minor

Food - Breakfast was ok, not amazing, but pretty good.  Had dinner at the bar and it was very good and reasonable.   

Location - very close to where I works so good for that, will admit though that it is a bit far from lots of the attractions and restaurants etc, so you are in for a hike or a cab to get to most places, but wasn't a huge deal for me.

Overall a good place.",5,2015,03,23
206,The Only Place to Stay in Dublin,"What a fabulous hotel with wonderful Service!
I love this hotel. I have just returned from a weekend stay and I can't speak highly enough about the staff and the facilities.
This was a family trip and we were traveling with a 5 year old little girl and whilst this hotel is ultra modern and fashionable they catered very well for both the adults and children.
On returning from the hotel I realized I had left a diamond necklace in my room. Robert in Concierge was so helpful and efficient in tracking down the necklace and arranging for it's return.
I would also like to mentioned Jose in the brassiere who was wonderful - friendly and so helpful. It was a pleasure coming down to breakfast every morning.
Thank you The Marker we had a wonderful time and would love to visit again !!!!",5,2015,03,23
206,A nice Stay,"Myself and my husband recently stayed as a treat, we found our stay to be pleasant the room was lovely although no view only into another building this was a little disappointing as this was a treat for us both. We found all the staff to be extremely friendly. On booking we received email detailing the our costs per night in the email it stated that our price per night and that this included Bed, Breakfast, Valet parking, Wifi, Taxes and charges and upon check in we paid the full cost up front but when we were departing we were charged an extra cost for valet parking we found this to be extremely poor form and as we did not have email proving what it had said we had to pay the extra costs.
We waited a total of 2 nights and on our second night there we decided to order room service but the food was not good my husbands was burnt and my pizza was not cooked for a price of ‚Ç¨70 it was totally inedible. 
For a 5 star hotel I would have expected a lot more from the hotel, we had breakfast there one morning and for the price per person, I would have expected a lot more than an average over cooked buffet style breakfast. 
Basically I found hotel to be average and not to be 5 star at all. We felt that the price to stay at this hotel was over priced as we have previously stayed in other Dublin Hotels that are just as nice but a lot less cost.",3,2015,03,23
206,Lovely Hotel !,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, there were 7 people in our party, age range was 5-72, the staff were lovely, especially in the restaurant, where they were happy to adapt the menu for my daughter who is 5. I found all the staff very friendly towards us, and my daughter was welcome in all areas of the hotel. The swimming pool is open to children at certain times, and we made use of this, there were other children using the pool too. There is also a play area at the side of the hotel which the staff made us aware of. The room was clean, and I would definitely staff here again, I found it a very child friendly hotel !",5,2015,03,23
206,Best in Dublin.,"Had an expensive last minute rate, but you can't go wrong with the Marker. 
Unless you are not into contemporary design. 
Fantastic pool. Design is outstanding in the lobby, pretty good in the rooms, but a bit bland and impersonal. 

As usual with most hotels, difficult to get pitch black given I had corner room with like 12 floor-to-ceiling windows - which bothers me but most likely not that many people. 

Excellent food. 
Taxis are always available downstairs, and Dublin is not very spread out. 
Most companies are headquartered in this ""new"" area of the city.",5,2015,03,22
206,Funky hotel with good service and comfort to match,"A short notice trip for my partner's work meant finding a hotel at short notice. I chose the Marker based on the pictures on-line as it looked interesting. Success! Not only is the architecture funky, and interesting but the rooms are very comfortable, a good size and quiet. The staff have been exceptionally helpful and accommodating, the cocktails were good. Sadly not enough time to visit the swimming pool. The location is a little bit isolated from Dublin centre but there are a few places nearby to eat and drink which look promising and the Energy Theatre is next door. The walk to town centre is around 15 minutes but on a slightly less than inviting main road, however you could take the DART train into the centre a station is very close by and a cab would only be a few Euro's. Compared to any of the older more established hotels we have seen in the twin centre The Marker Hotel seems by far the most boutique.",5,2015,03,22
206,Outstanding,This hotel is amazing. Stayed over the weekend for a family birthday.  The food in the restaurant was just amazing.  The staff were all extremely pleasant.  The leisure facilities were then best ever ..  A treat not to be missed. Miriam,5,2015,03,22
206,Could not have been better!,"One of the best hotels I've ever stayed.  The concierge helped plan day trips, arranged all taxis and even arranged to have flowers delivered to room by local florist.  Restaurant food was great.  Bar service was spot on.  Rooms exceptionally clean.",5,2015,03,22
206,Incredible Hotel,"The hotel is wonderful.  We stayed here over St. Patrick's Day.  It is far enough from everything that you don't get the madness of the crowds.  It is about a 15 - 20 minute walk to city centre, and about a 15 euro cab ride depending on the traffic for the day.   The bar food was excellent as were the drinks.  I was  very impressed with how nice the entire staff was from check in to check out.  If you needed anything they all went out of the way to help you out and get what you needed.    The room was plenty big enough for my wife and I to stay in and the view was great.  It was a very bright room.  You did have to put your key card in a slot to turn the lights on.  From there you controlled the lights at the switches.  When you left you pulled the key card out and all the lights went out.  I'm guessing this is way to not waste energy.  We didn't have any issues with the key card for the elevator, as I know some people have mentioned.  I would stay here again.",5,2015,03,20
206,"Good business hotel (location, service, cleanliness)","The service in the bar and lobby has been one of the best I've ever encountered. Rooftop is exceptional and  rooms are spacious and clean, while the bathroom was the best quality part of it. Just not 5 stars as it's quite pricey for Dublin (and room decoration is a little dry)",4,2015,03,20
206,Loved It!,"We Stayed Here For 3 Nights Over St Patrick's Day & Absolutely Loved It :) The Spa&Wellness Area Was Amazing & So Relaxing! The Rooms Were Very Modern, Extremely Clean & The Housekeeping Was Always On Key :) The City Centre Is About A 15 Minute Walk Away But A Convenient Taxi Service Runs Outside The Hotel (About ‚Ç¨7 Into Temple Bar) With Also A Bus Stop Located Just Around The Corner :) Would Definitely Recommend To Family&Friends!!!!",5,2015,03,19
206,Great Location and Bar,"Overall good. Don't like not being able to open a window - aircon all the time can be very drying. Room we got (113) was very dark. 

I had booked a night on my own card and a company had prepaid a second night for me. I identified this at check-in yet I received a knock at the room door on the second day wondering if I was checking out. This shouldn't have happened.

The lifts were quite temperamental with the room cards - this may be just me but it was a bit annoying.

Don't like having to walk by a porter every time I leave the room - sometimes you just want to keep your head down and not have to say 'hi'. I'm sure they don't care what I do but I felt a bit watched. A lot of folk on trip advisor have commented on this also. I suppose this is a personal thing and i'm sure plenty of people love it and it's a judgement thing from the staff but I prefer to feel anonymous in hotels. 

Gym was great. Pool was great (including sauna/steamroom/jacuzzi).

Cocktails are fantastic!",4,2015,03,18
206,great location,"We stayed here for the 6 Nations Rugby Match , its a perfect location for anyone that will be going to the Aviva Stadium,  It is aslo as stones throw into Dublin centre.

All the staff were very attentive, rooms lovley and spotlessly clean with great views . Breakfast had an impressive spread. we also had lunch in the Bistro which was very taste!

I would definitly recomend staying here.",4,2015,03,15
206,The place to be,"A new entrant to Dublin's growing hotel scene and well worth a visit.  Rooms are large with amazingly comfortable beds and plenty of amenities for working.  The bar downstairs is a lively spot and great for people watching. You get a sense that this is a happening place (in a happening city) and is very stylish and contemporary

I was initially concerned about the location having only previously stayed in more central hotels, but this proved not to be a problem and there are a number of bars and cafes nearby and it's only a 15 minute walk into the centre of Dublin. 

Staff were very polite and helpful and the club sandwich I ordered on rooms service was the best I've ever had anywhere.

The only downside to my stay were that the pool and spa were closed, as was the rooftop bar (though that was less of an issue in early March).  I will certainly use this as an excuse to visit again so that I can take advantage of all the facilities.",4,2015,03,13
206,Great break,"We stayed one night in The Marker hotel, while attending a concert.
We ate in the hotel the pre-theatre menu had plenty of choice and waitress was very helpful.
We had cocktails after the concert in the bar - delicious.
Bedroom had great view and very comfortable bed.
Overall great location and lovely break.",4,2015,03,13
206,Very disappointing stay,"When booking this stay reservations were incredibly rude and when we arrived the pool was closed and the gym is only average. In fact, the gym is nice but the simple things dont work, which is not what I expected from this hotel. 

It is hard to believe that this 5 star hotel is only 2 years old. The white walls around the reception and many doors saying 'employees only' are become badly discoloured from use. 

The mini bar was not full upon arrival and despite calling to inform them of this, they did not seem to care and it was not replenished. 

On the plus side, breakfast was nice, but we felt under pressure to leave despite there being very few guests around. It was also surprising to see very few Irish people working at this hotel. Perhaps our stay coincided with a time in which the Irish staff just happened to be off. 

Not a great experience and there is certainly better out there.",1,2015,03,12
206,Fabulous hotel,"Would just like to say a huge thank you to everyone at The Marker.
We have just returned from the best weekend. The staff are great as is the food, the suites and the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept in! Cocktails are excellent too. Excellent hotel and will definitely return!",5,2015,03,09
206,Where else in Dublin?,Simply the best hotel i have stayed in out of all the other Dublin hotels. Very nice rooms with absolutely stunning bathrooms. The underfloor heating is pure luxury as is the deep old style bath tub. Loved the designer toiletries also. Its nice to see a hotel that doesn't use the run of the mill cheap stuff.,5,2015,03,09
206,"When in Dublin, stay at this new, clean, safe hotel with beautiful views of the canal!","I know a lot of people want to stay right in the middle of all the tourist traps, but I enjoy staying a few blocks away in a quiet setting with the canal directly outside he front door and sunshine streaming in the windows. This is the newest hotel in Dublin with gorgeous rooms of excellent size and big bathrooms with full soaking tubs, just a precious retreat!!",5,2015,03,08
206,It's all about style,"If you want a stylish hotel down in the Docklands, The Marker will hit the spot. It is all cool greys and citrines and sharp angles. Also, if you like having lots of staff about you will enjoy the Marker, especially in the lobby area (though not necessarily in the restaurant area). And if somebody else is paying for your room you will be even more likely to like it. 

It is not, however, a family oriented hotel, and I am not surprised that the people who have brought their small children didn't care for it. I don't blame the hotel, however: they are what they are, and they don't pretend to be otherwise. It is clearly targeting an upscale urban market- the demographic being well-off (or expense account) 30-something and older people who think that they are still cool enough to be included in that group. 

Although I heard (and read on TripAdvisor) some gripes about the food, I found it to be fine. The menu is a bit limited, but it was tasty enough. The waiter, who was French, had great advice on wine. Breakfast range was good, and the plates are kept in a warmer so that your hot breakfast doesn't get chilled. 

There are a lot of 'little touches' to make you feel special: 2 of you in the room? two mints for each of you at turn down. Get your car back from valet parking? glass bottles of The Marker Water are waiting for you in the cup holders. 

Having said that, I didn't warm to the place. It all felt a bit too self-conscious- but then I tend to prefer human warmth over cool perfection. To each their own.",4,2015,03,06
206,Most convenient for business travelers,"Best location, most helpful staff, i have never been treated so kindly by hotel staff before.  I praise the general manager for keeping such motivated staff.  The room was perfect, wifi is excellent, gym was a little small but still good",5,2015,03,02
206,Great trip,"Went for a weekend away an this hotel was amazing, the spa and staff are great with a good location. We asked for a water front room an received it .  Really nice to have a drink in the bar area next to the fire when it's cold. Can understand why this is one of the top hotels in Dublin. Would def stay there again.",5,2015,03,02
206,Outstanding,"I have stayed in some good hotels but this tops them all. From the lovely helpful staff, gorgeous lobby, fantastic luxurious rooms - to the little touches such as fab toiletries and turn down service with slippers and chocolates. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff who are a credit to this establishment. Even a 10am check in! The location is a little out of the way, but nothing more than a nice walk along the river, a 5 minutes taxi ride or the tour bus stop very near by. Stay here. You will not be disappointed.",5,2015,03,01
206,Very disappointing ,"Stayed here for one night in January with my husband for our anniversary. I was looking forward to it for ages! 
First thing that hit me when we walked into the hotel was the strange atmosphere. An excess of staff members standing around looking very serious to the point of it being uncomfortable. Check in was fine, we were upgraded to a corner suite which was great....until we realised the 'Corner suite' was just a larger bedroom with a bigger bathroom. I'm not sure what the definition of a suite is but I've had upgrades before to suites which were amazing and normally two rooms-this was not! 
The room was nice, very modern with nice toiletries etc but minibar was grossly overpriced.
We ate in the bar for lunch. We had two sandwiches and fries-for a 5 star hotel I would've expected the sandwich to be a hell of a lot better, it was very basic standard! The bar also had a very strange atmosphere with staff looking like they were afraid to smile or relax.
We ate in the restaurant that night and I was extremely disappointed! The food was flavourless. I was genuinely sorry we didn't venture out for our meal.
The spa was fine, pool facilities were lovely but treatment area not great for this standard of hotel.
All in all I had been so excited to stay here but was beyond disappointed! 
I feel this is definitely a hotel that has been overly hyped. When you stay in a 5 star hotel you might expect comfort and class but there's a distinct lack of class here.
It's suits the pre theatre crowd due to its location and the valet parking was nice-although the extra parking charge was not! 
Definitely would not return and would not recommend to others
",2,2015,03,01
206,Good experience,"We stayed here only one night before returning to the UK. It's mostly great.

Pros:
New, clean, helpful staff, nice food in the bar, seems to be nice restaurants nearby
Con:
Bit hard to get to if you're driving - our GPS struggled, not close to the touristy stuff

A small thing - there didn't seem to be any sort of desk lamp, and it has the usual very very dim hotel lighting, so the desk was unusable. There was an iPod charger that looked like it should be a light as well, but just didn't turn on or work despite staff assistance. 

But on the whole, a great stay. I like clean and modern.",4,2015,02,28
206,This must be heaven,"We were lucky enough to have a trip to Dublin be part of our February calendar. And to make life perfect we were scheduled to stay at the Marker Hotel. We were greeted warmly upon arrival and quickly checked into our beautiful bedroom. The bathroom was marble lined with a soaking tub and luxurious shower.  The bed linens were amazing and it must be the most comfortable mattress ever.
Even the Dublin February weather has been perfect.  And tomorrow I can't wait. For a swim in their beautiful pool.  Now I know what heaven is.",5,2015,02,27
206,Second wonderful stay,"This was our second stay in this hotel. We were so impressed by it last year we stayed the weekend after Valentines and we are returning twice more this year.
If you like luxury and quality this is the hotel.
Friendly staff and great facilities in an excellent location.
Love this place.
Could move in!",5,2015,02,27
206,Trendiest of the 5 Star Dublin Hotels,"I was treated to a night here for my birthday recently. The standard, service and general atmosphere is most definitely of a five star quality. The room and general decor was chic (and very comfortable!!). We had breakfast and a brunch, both of which were very good. The bar is lovely, and the list of delicious cocktails will satisfy even the thirstiest of customers! We were also upgraded because of the occasison, which is always always a big plus in my view.

We also used the pool, jacuzzi, gym, steam room and sauna facilities during our stay. Although the pool is quite shallow, hence not entirely suitable if you wanted to do a few lengths, it is PERFECT for spending an hour or two just relaxing - moving from the pool, to the jacuzzi / steam room / etc.

The one point I would say is that it is not within a reasonable walking distance of the city centre of Dublin. One could definitely walk it, but it would take at least 30 minutes or so - although a taxi into the centre would take 10 minutes.

Overall, it's definitely the trendiest of Dublin's five star hotels, albeit not as centrally located. However, I would whole wholeheartedly recommend it for those looking for a trendy hotel of a solid five star standard.",5,2015,02,26
206,Amazing,"Second time staying for concert in 02/3arena..absolutely amazing hotel, ideal central location near city centre..amazing rooms most comfortable beds iv ever experienced..staff extremely friendly and willing to help",5,2015,02,25
206,Great Hotel ok Location,"Really nice hotel, very cool interior with massive rooms and really comfortable beds! Area around the hotel was nice, my only negative is it isnt right in the city centre 15 minute walk through not the nicest area or ‚Ç¨10 in a taxi! 

",5,2015,02,25
206,Perfect luxury mini-break hotel,"My husband and I had a fantastic 2 night stay here. The standard was definitely 5 star, from the room design and decor, to the lobby and bar, spa and pool area, and breakfast buffet selection.

I can definitely recommend Luh the spa therapist very highly - her massage and facial were wonderful. 

We would love to stay here again on our next visit - hopefully when the roof top bar is open!

Only slight downside was the distance from city centre (20 min walk), meaning we got a few more cabs than anticipated at night, but worth it for the facilities and views of the docklands from the room.",5,2015,02,24
206,Good Hotel,"Good Hotel, with friendly staff and excellent facilities.  

We took the airlink, which was cheaper with a 72 hour pass that allows you to use the hop on hop off city tour.  Hotel a little out of the city but well within walking distance.

Theatre is right outside hotel",5,2015,02,24
206,Lovely stay,"My boyfriend and I stayed for two nights for a weekend city break. The hotel was great, the staff were only too happy to help with anything and catered for all your needs. We didn't eat in the Brasserie but we did have some food from the bar which again was good and the cocktails were delicious, but pricey! The wellness spa is also worth a visit! The location is probably the only thing that doesn't score so highly as it is a 15/20 min walk from the centre however I can imagine it is good for business stays. The rooms are spacious and imaculate, we had already had the room cleaned for the day and yet when we popped back there had been a delivery of chocolates and slippers, nice little touches. Would definitely stay again. ",5,2015,02,23
206,Excellent ,"A really great hotel, rooms are spacious with everything you need. The bathrooms are huge with fancy toiletries. The spa is just what you need but treatments were full so book ahead.

In a addition there is a nice a la carte selection.",4,2015,02,21
206,Super,"Stayed here on a weekend trip to Dublin and a show in the Theatre across the road. Great location, superb facilities and welcoming staff. Rooms are large, modern, clean and well equipped. We ate in the restaurant off the lobby and had one of the best ""hotel "" meals ever. Wide variety of choices, superbly presented and served with a smile. Steak was as good as any in town. Our Waitress was fast, knowledgeable and extremely friendly. Definitely be back. Thanks ! ",5,2015,02,20

206,Sad to say Would not stay again!,"Stayed the monday 16 for our valentines night away ... Was extremely disappointed we were told at reception booking in that we were upgraded (which we were definetly not !) in fairness place was very clean which to me is #1 .. Air con /heating was broke in our room it was actually -1 that night outside and our room was still unbelievably warm so can't imagine if it wasn't freezing what it would be like ! My partner tried calling reception where he was told to keep trying card in slot and see would it work which it didn't , finally got a fan brought to room which sounded like a generator it was that noisey so we got no sleep at all ! To make things worse shower was broke the next Morning the nozzle was pointing at shower door and near flooded the bathroom under door so had to use all towels to clean up water( I could never leave a hotel room messy!) to be honest just wanted to get out of the place .. Have stayed numerous times in dublin would defo not stay here again I would recommend the Gibson hotel in point village if your looking for elegance and for half the price if not less !!! ",2,2015,02,18
206,everything was brilliant apart from the food,"difficult this , but this was nearly a perfect stay , everything about this hotel is sublime , rooms brilliant , beds brilliant , health club brilliant , staff amazing, bar brilliant , get the picture fantastic location , i will be back time and time again , 
the only down side for me was the brasserie maybe i am picky i thought the food was average to say the least presentation was great just meat overcooked , i chose cheese for sweet and it was very cold , like just taken out of a fridge and not had chance to adapt to room temp, 
including a blue 
apart from that this is a truly great hotel well done to all the staff great place really",5,2015,02,18
206,Quality Hotel,"We have recently returned from a two night stay at The Marker. An excellent hotel with extremely  helpful staff. We arrived straight from the airport very early to drop our bags off and our room was ready for us.

Our room was large with a lovely big bathroom and very comfortable bed. We enjoyed the hotel bar too which was reasonably priced - especially for Dublin.   

The walk into Temple Bar took about 15 minutes along the river.",5,2015,02,17
206,Simply Perfect,I stayed here with my boyfriend for one night and I just wish it was for two! The service from the moment we arrived was fantastic. The room itself was top-notch with every facility possible and we had an incredible sleep. Before we headed for dinner we enjoyed a lovely couple of drinks at the bar and the next morning we had a relaxing dip in the pool. I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be returning myself.,5,2015,02,17
206,Birthday treat,Went to Marker Hotel for my Grand Daughter's 18 Birthday.It was a very special treat for her.The hotel is really lovely and the rooms are great with plenty of room.The staff are very friendly .We had a drink in hotel bar which we found expensive.We went out for dinner.Had breakfast in restaurant next morning.For such a big hotel someone needs to give the chef some tips on how to make proper porridge.Breakfast was ok.Just glad we did not eat there night before.We were waiting for car for 25 minutes .No one had bothered to tell us it was outside.I would not go again unless it was a special occasion.If anyone is thinking of going.Have a full wallet with you.,3,2015,02,16
206,Excellent,"I stayed at the marker hotel for 3 nights and have just returned.

What can I say from the very first contact with the hotel about accessible rooms it was brilliant! 

Upon arrive the access into the hotel was flat and the staff very helpful. The security in the hotel was also very good. The room I stayed in was an accessible room and fully accessible for me, I was so pleased, flat access through out.  The cake in the room was also yummy!

The staff were always polite and helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them. I asked if the spa facilities were ok for the wheelchair and a member of the staff kindly showed us around the spa facilities just so I could assess before using it. 

We used the spa area (pool, jacuzzi steam and sauna room) what can I say a real calming experience. Again all flat access for the wheelchair in and around the room. 

We also ate at the hotel on the final evening. The food was lovely and service again was excellent. Plenty of room around the bar area again for the wheelchair.

Up on checking out the staff helped with the 2 wheelchairs and luggage. I was sad to leave after a fantastic visit and a great start to my 30th celebrations! 

Thank you The Marker Hotel",5,2015,02,16
206,A Relaxing Stay,"My girlfriend and I have just returned from a 2 night stay, we were welcomed to the hotel by friendly staff, bags were offered to be carried, we arrived at 11 ish and were extremely pleased that our room was ready. The superior room was fantastic, large bathroom and room. The hotel is situated about 20-25mins walk from Dublin centre and a safe walk too. The area where the hotel is is a newer area of the city boasting cafes etc and a dock area. Through the day we generally walked into town but it's a definite taxi ride into the city for an evening which isn't a problem. We went to the spa on Saturday a really nice pool although could have been slightly warmer a bit cold really, steam room etc was fantastic and very relaxing. In summary if you're looking for a nice weekend away in a nice quiet area of the city but with lots of cafes etc this place is for you the walk into town wasn't a problem for us so don't be put off by that, lots of pubs or cafes along the way for a coffee",4,2015,02,16
206,Birthday weekend,"Just been back to the Marker for the third time this month. Love this place. 

Today we got an upgrade to room 620. All I can say is unbelievable!  The suite is fantastic. Two rooms, two bathrooms. Amazing view. 

The staff were brilliant as always and arranged flowers and cake which was really tasty!",5,2015,02,15
206,Good business hotel,"Stayed for one night in January. Good bar area, with good service - a little generic but fine for a night. Room the same - not that memorable but all done to a nice standard and quiet / comfortable. Location is ideal for city centre business district.",4,2015,02,15
206,Fantastic modern hotel,"From the moment we arrived service has been excellent especially unni in reception . Slight mix up on restaurant sorted rapidly even eith a fully booked valentines dinner.

206,Beautiful hotel hotel the middle of downtown,"Very nice hotel and fantastic conference room. The rooms are very well suited and breakfast as well as restaurant is very high quality. 
Big recommendation if you can afford a little more because it is not cheap",4,2015,02,13
206,"Style, Attention & Quality in Dublin","At last a great hotel in Dublin, for many years now I have tried a different hotel in the city every time I visit. Over 3-4 years of visiting 4 times per year I have never found a hotel good enough to return back to - until visiting The Marker! It is quite excellent. I will return here, it is a first!

I only have 2 criticisms.. waiting at reception upon arrival was too long. They need more staff at peak periods. Once at the counter the attention was superb but the wait was much too long. Secondly the location is in Dublins docklands, which have/are being revitalised, hence the location is a little too far to comfortably walk to meetings and shops in the actual centre. You need to make great use of Dublin's filthy taxi's to get around rapidly and comfortably. The hotel needs an arrangement with a good taxi firm to ensure immediate front door availability of good, clean cars suitable for the business and family traveller.",5,2015,02,13
206,great hotel in a nice environment,"friendly staff, well kept hotel. delicious breakfast buffet , cozy and lively bar. spacious rooms with good beds and quality products. silent at night, excellent spa & sports facilities. nice location (canal, businesses, opera,...).",5,2015,02,12
206,Amazing ,"Stayed here twice oh my god I loved it rooms are amazing dinner in restaurant was flawless and the waitress who's name escapes me was simply a delight extensive wine list. The cocktails are simply the best I've ever had. Breakfast was just amazing although when I stay at five star I don't expect the breakfast/service manager to go around on both times I stayed there to ask me to tell me he's taking the breakfast buffet away would I like to get anything from it, didn't appericiate that considering how much money it cost to stay there. Saying that I loved it there and would definitely stay there again. The wellness centre/ Spa is amazing. Everyone has to stay here at least once in there lifetime. 
Well done guys keep up the good work.üëç",5,2015,02,11
206,"a late ,wet,tired marker","we arrived late at night, we were both tired and wet from rain that night. check-in was slow. the bell  boy insisted  on showing us  how wonderful  the room was. I said ""good night"".
he did not see we were not in the mood for that. the coffee maker was a french press type. worked poorly. result, NO COFFEE!
no a happy camper! this is after a week in Wales and a 4 hr. ferry ride and 3 hr. bus ride.",5,2015,02,11
206,Stylish,"Stayed here last year for a weekend break in Dublin, very stylish and tastefully decorated, the roof top bar is something special. Our room looked out across the square and the docks, the room was spacious with a massive   bed, the bathroom was also big with a nice bath and a  large walk in shower. Although we did not use the main restaurant, we had a bar snack which was nice, breakfast  was superb, all  set with  modern furniture and fixings in a  contemporary way. Location was perfect for our sightseeing and would happily recommend to friends.",5,2015,02,10
206,Great hotel and friendly staff,"We had a fantastic stay at the Marker over a weekend in January. We are experienced travellers and value good service, high quality restaurants and friendly staff. The polish doorman and concierge Bartosz was very helpful and serivce-minded. Keep up the good work at the Marker.",5,2015,02,10
206,Solid Hotel,"This is my second time at this hotel.  Stayed here due to work again and had a back facing room.  No real view but I guess I have to upgrade for that.  Nice ""new"" area with a few restaurants, cafes, delis, and overpriced supermarket.  Hotel front desk was very helpful in recommending day tours as I stayed two more days for leisure.  About a 15 minute walk to Trinity college/Grafton street area, which is the only drawback I see.  Other than that, a modern, clean hotel that deserves its high ranking",4,2015,02,09
206,"5* Surroundings, 3* Service","Stayed here back in November. The Marker is every bit how you had expected from its exquisite photos. Modern and super stylish. 'Moody' decor and luxurious fixtures and fittings within the guest rooms and common areas. Quirky jaggered edges throughout, you feel like you're in the definition of modern. Everything about the decor screams 5* and is definitely deserving of such a high rating, a huge disappointment then that the service is anything but. 

Disinterested staff made you feel like you were just another number through the door. On complaining, the general manager even tried to argue that we were incorrect.. clear indication that as thought, no care or attentiveness was awarded to their guests. 

Huge let down overall. Had been so excited having heard many great things about the hotel. Simply won't return because of the service. ",2,2015,02,09
206,Nice,"The hotel was just a short walk from the Luas stop which brought us from Heuston Station in about 20 minutes. We arrived early to the hotel and were delighted to find that a room was available for us. The reception staff were very friendly and welcoming. The room was nice and modern, if a little characterless, and absolutely spotless! We found that the minibar was extremely over-priced and disappointing. The location is fantastic if you are going to see a show at the Bord Gais Theatre which is just next door to the hotel. We were going to see a show at the 3 Arena and found that the hotel was well situated for this also (it is just a 10/15 minute walk from the hotel). When we stayed the rooftop bar was unfortunately closed but we had a nice drink in the bar in the lobby. There are also a number of nice restaurants and bars located around the square and the Luas will bring you right into the city centre. The area itself is quiet and we had a pleasant stay. For a 5 star hotel we found it a little on the bland side and overpriced but a nice place to stay nonetheless.",4,2015,02,09
206,Outstanding as always,"Visited The Marker hotel for our fourth time at the weekend, this place never fails to impress! A lovely gentleman greeted us at the door to take our luggage & car. Arriving at around 2pm we were checked in which we weren't expecting as check in isn't until 3! Room was great as always, I did request a front facing room which I wasn't given however all the rooms in the hotel are just as good as each other so didn't mind! Cocktails & food (breakfast lunch & dinner) here are gorgeous, we were also given 2 birthday cupcakes for my boyfriends birthday which was a nice touch, & I didn't even ask for them! 

Great buzz around the bar/lounge area until late, you wouldn't even need to leave the hotel for the town!

The pool/spa is something else, one of the best I have visited!

Only bad thing was that the rooftop bar was closed during our weekend & it's one of the main reasons we stay at this hotel, great time here again all the same & without a doubt I will be back again & again",5,2015,02,09
206,Simply fantastic!,"We wouldn't hesitate in recommending The Marker as a fantastic place to stay in Dublin. 
Despite a very short stay of just one evening we have returned home feeling well rested and refreshed having thoroughly enjoyed our time at The Marker. 
The hotel itself is beautiful, but what really makes it stand apart from other hotels is it's staff. We found every member of the Marker team to be friendly, welcoming, polite and courteous.
In our view, it is the simple things that can often make the best impression. Thoughtful gestures and a friendly, happy workforce...both of which the Marker have done very well in our experience. ",5,2015,02,08
206,Beautiful Hotel in Beautiful Location,"I Love this hotel, Its my new Favourite Hotel to stay in Dublin. Try the roof top bar, they even offer you snuggle blankets & hot water bottles on chilly evenings. Very Cool & really stylish. Walking distance to City Centre & cool little shops & cafes on the doorstep.",5,2015,02,08
206,friendly staff; good location for show.,"Stayed as was seeing a show in the Point/ 3 Arena.  Good location.
Staff were all friendly and helpful.....
Room- excellent; comfortable, good size, and QUIET.
Myself and wife had meal in the brasserie; I was DISAPPOINTED with the Pork belly- I have had a few times before and expected it to crispy; however the fat was soggy/soft; not as good as should have been...... The rest of the meal was good though, and my wife enjoyed the sea trout.....
Good wine list.",4,2015,02,08
206,The perfect wedding day!,"We would be happy to recommend this amazing hotel! We had our wedding reception on the rooftop of the Marker and it was perfect. 

We were very happy and satisfied with the professionalism of the Events Executive, Linda O'Neill for really looking after us with all the details of the occasion, Barry and Sandra who were there throughout the day, staying on top of everything for us and Gareth the chef for providing us with an incredible variety of delicious food. Every single member of staff were so warm, friendly and professional that it really made a difference for us and our guests on our special day.The owner greeted us on arrival with champagne and gave it that personal touch. They were very accommodating of our needs.We were absolutely thrilled with our room.

They really made our dream day come true and more. We had the best day of our lives and will never forget it.

Simon & Kika",5,2015,02,07
206,Could stay there for weeks!,"Stayed there on a business trip for 4 days last October. One of the best properties ever to be accommodated, undoubtedly. So many great reviews, actually proved to be realistic.
Upon arrival around 11:00 am, the room, as expected, was not ready. Within an hour, (early) check-in was allowed, together with a complimentary upgrade to a 4th floor room overlooking the Canal. It seems that this upgrade is readily offered, when possible. A very nice touch, indeed. The view to the waterfront was great. The top-to-floor window let daylight brighten the room interior and allowed best possible views, night and day. Room was great, very modern, well appointed.
Bed was perfect, its mattress unbeatable, had some of the best and most relaxing sleeping times ever!
Breakfast was just delicious! Firstly, staff was very courteous and willing to serve, always with their best smile. That was true for all staff members of the hotel. Quality of food served for breakfast was of very high standards, one of the first things to remember about that hotel. Try the variety of cheeses offered, one by one. It becomes obvious why Ireland is famous for its dairy products.
City center and Temple Bar area is a 20-25 minute walk, alongside the river. Taxi ride is around 8-10 euros, max. 
Dublin Convention Center is a 7-8 minute, 450 meter walk across the nearby bridge, over Liffey River. In the same direction, on N Wall Quay, the bus-stops with connection towards and from the airport, are located. 
Overall, highly recommended. 
Dublin itself is a great destination. Simplicity, hospitality and friendliness of locals are enough to convince that another visit should be arranged soon!",5,2015,02,03
206,Excellent,"Excellent hotel, fantastic location, great service. 
Really really classy and modern hotel with great customer service. 
Highly recommended.

I had room service for breakfast. Excellent plentiful menu to choose from and good quality food.

206,A palatial facial - top marks..!,"Firstly I must preface this with the fact that I am not regular reviewer, however I was motivated to document my 'palatial style' facial that I experienced recently at the Marker Spa. Picture this; I arrive and I'm greeted warmly by Tunde at Front Desk and welcomed to get cosy in a robe and slippers where I float into a treatment room, escorted by my lovely therapist, Olia.  ''A robe and slippers ...but It's a facial, I jested?''....After a short inquiry to my facial needs and concerns I am asked if the music is to my liking and asked to select my preferred treatment oil. Now I'll save you the minute details, again, treat yourself and experience it first hand....but close your eyes and imagine lying in a warm bed, with a heated leg rest pillow, candles and soft music, where my palatial facial began with warm mittens for my hands, heated towel for my feet, and then an extensive face, arms and decolletage massage followed by facial treatment of heavenly elixirs (hold your nose for the spirulina mask!, lol) that had me so relaxed, I almost fell asleep. After the treatment Olia, presented me with my slippers which she had heated and a surprising refreshment and left me to unwind in the relaxing areas. Those who know me, know that I'm not used to 'extreme relaxation' so I made my way for a quick dip in the luxurious infinity pool and jacuzzi! Top marks for the Marker, where I felt like a Queen for a few hours, shhhhhh tell everybody!",5,2015,02,03
206,Lovin the marker,"Stayed here last night celebrating our anniversary

Room
The room was lovely very modern, loved the underfloor heating in the bathroom and toiletries.

Amenities 
Had a swim in the pool -it's a decent length sauna, jacuzzi and steam room - it's really beautiful and very relaxing, they could do with more seats and the water tap is very uncouth! But definitely recommended

Food
Had Le drunch - it was lovely - we went down at 4:30 and it emptied out by 5:30 so I'd advise to go earlier.  I had the salad - top notch and the beef - the presentation of the beef could have been better,it was presented on top of a v.small amount of mash and the sauce was totally absorbed into the mash.  The beef was a little tough - will ask for heifer next time

Drinks
Gorgeous mojitos, and great selection of wine by the glass - rooftop bar closed which was a pity

Parking
‚Ç¨20 valet which is as good a deal as you will get in this location 

Overall, great hotel - it's a good walk from st Stephens green but has great facilities - recommended.",4,2015,02,02

Disappointed the roof top bar was closed but gives us an excuse to return very soon :-)",5,2015,02,01
206,Superb Hotel,"stayed here recently over a weekend.  chose this hotel for its proximity to the Bord Gais Theatre.  its literally outside the hotel door.
a valet parked our car on arrival, great value for ‚Ç¨20 nightly.  check-in was with a charming and welcoming girl called Tara.  she told us we had been upgraded to #534.  she was efficient and friendly at the same time.  the bedroom corridors are very tastefully decorated.  we opened our bed room door to be amazed by the room.  a wonderful space is the best way to describe our room.  every modern convenience and a big comfortable bed.  the hotel bar was really busy after our show had finished but table service was not an issue, thankfully.
breakfast was very enjoyable.  all the usuals on the buffet with eggs benedict served at the table.  the swimming pool was pure bliss, particularly with no children between 12pm and 3.  a haven of tranquility and relaxation.  the remainder of our stay was very enjoyable. all of the hotel team are so hospitable in every way and nothing is any effort to them.  the concierges, in particular, are true gentlemen.
the only negative is that we had to leave!  well done to all, can't wait to come back soon.",5,2015,02,01
206,my new first choice in dublin,"first time to stay at the marker . location was fine . the hotel itself was modern and welcoming . staff are very friendly indeed . the bar food looked lovely and had a nice comfortable atmosphere with a wide selection of beers , cocktails etc . my room was large and modern and the bathroom was very clean . breakfast was fine . overall i really liked the marker and it would be my first choice when staying in Dublin again .",5,2015,02,01
206,Infinity swimming pool,"I loved the infinity pool.  Pool is open from 6am to 8pm (I think) which was great as I was able to use it twice. For this reason alone I will stay there in future.  It is annoying when pools open late and close early.  

Bar isn't bad even though it's really in the lobby.  

Bedrooms lovely but not huge.  

Breakfast is expensive but I didn't have it as I was having it elsewhere. I suppose it's ok to have an expensive breakfast if the room rate is fair which it is.",5,2015,01,29
206,Great hotel,"Hotel is about a 10-15 minute walk from the centre in the doclands area and a nice walk into town. Hotel is modern and luxurious and the staff are very attentive and helpful. 

Breakfast was excellent quality, delicious and a lot of choice, also very accomodating and friendly towards my 15 month old son. We didn't eat at the hotel as I had already made reservations, however if this trip had been without our son, we would have definitely eaten there. The hotel restaurant and bar areas were busy on a Friday and Saturday as this seemed the place to be and the decor and atmosphere was very good.

We had a deluxe room which was nice. The carpet throughout the hotel was very deep plush and I had no hesitation letting my little boy crawl around our room, as it was spotless. Bathroom was marble with heated floor and excellent quality toiletries provided, bath also very big and deep. Bed very comfortable and you can order different pillows if you so wish. 

We ordered room service for dinner for our son twice off the children's menu and the food was excellent, particularly the fish fingers, which were actually big chunky goujons.

Pool and area was lovely, clean and not busy.

Checkout was smooth and efficient.",5,2015,01,29
206,Great Meal at Marker Brasserie .,"We had dinner here before Rumors of Fleetwood Mac concert in B.G.T.It was a treat . Each of six courses had quality tasty ingredients .The choice was good and highlights were the special seafood starter,guinea fowl and the sea trout dishes.Service was excellent from the warm welcome to detailed information on allergies ,to pacing of courses .Wine list also offers great choice.
Recommended ,and certainly well above average hotel restaurant fare.",5,2015,01,28
206,Perfect weekend,"Stayed at The Marker last weekend for two nights & what a treat it was. From the minute we arrived the staff could not do enough for us, all very friendly & helpful. The hotel it's self is stunning. Beautifully designed through out, our room was enormous with an equally enormous bathroom. The spa is delightful, very relaxing & tranquil. I had some treatments in the spa which were by far the best & most professional treatments I have ever received.  Breakfast was perfect, a lovely selection of hot & cold food on offer, not an ounce of grease in site, all top quality produce too. All in all could not fault this hotel which was worth every penny.",5,2015,01,27
206,Perfection,"Stayed for the first time yesterday. This hotel is first class we had an absolutely beautiful room, the bed was so comfortable, with bath and a massive shower. From the minute you arrive the staff are so attentive and the little touches make so much difference. There was a wide variety of delicious food for breakfast between hot and cold food. We went to the pool after which is so relaxing. Can't recommend enough such a stylish hotel with excellent staff we didn't want to leave!!",5,2015,01,25
206,Wonderful hotel with five star service,"We stayed for one night in the Marker and could not have been more impressed.  From the moment we arrived we were struck by how pleasant the staff were.  We were greeted with genuine warmth by Barry on arrival and he parked the car. That experience was replicated throughout our stay.  There was a small issue with our meal which was dealt with really well by Mark in the restaurant.  Our room was modern and spacious and the turn down service was amazing.  We ate in the restaurant as part of our package and the food was really good.  The pool area is fantastic and really well maintained.  Attention to detail is very clear, when got the car back there were two bottles of water on the seats for our trip home.  This is an ideal location if you are coming to Dublin for a short stay as the location is great, it is only 5 minutes from the DART and you could be on Grafton Street by foot in 15 minutes.  The only downside was the breakfast which was a buffet which didn't really fit with the overall experience.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Marker and would highly recommend it.  The staff in the hotel made our stay.",5,2015,01,25

You name it, it was excellent. From reception, staff friendliness, bar service, room, quality of breakfasts, concierge it was first rate. As good as anywhere in the Middle East and The Far East.
Only one adverse comment would be not enough drawer space in the room for storing clothes.
We would also add that Dublin ia also one of the most friendliest places on earth we have visited",5,2015,01,23
206,Luxury & very polite staff,"This hotel is luxurious with very comfortable beds, spacious rooms & hugs bathrooms with both shower & bath. The style is modern with lots of dark wood. The room had no outside noise.
My favorite area was the dark pool, Jacuzzi, team & sauna. There were sun loungers & bean bags to relax into.
The staff were polite, helpful & friendly.
The only negative aspect was the Wi-fi & phone signals. Both were intermittent, but I'm sure will be fixed soon.",5,2015,01,19
206,On The Mark,"The Marker is without a doubt the most fabulous hotel I have ever stayed in.  The staff across the board are so friendly & helpful, I am just so sorry I never booked breakfast, upon return I will for certain be having it!! Really gorgeous & luxurious beds& bathrooms. Can't rate it highly enough. ",5,2015,01,18
206,Hands-down best modern luxury hotel EVER.,"My husband and I decided to stay here for 2 nights on a whim when stopping back through Dublin during New Year's week after a family wedding. It is seriously the nicest, most comfortable, most friendly modern luxury hotel we have ever stayed in (and we are hotel snobs).

The room was beautiful, HUGE, and very nicely appointed. The bathroom floor has its own heating control - I mean, come on. It's as if they thought of everything when they designed it and left nothing to be desired. But, the star of the entire show...is the BED. Holy. It is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. That is not an overstatement. I don't know what mattress/linens/pads they use, but I really want to know because I would love to sleep like that every night. If someone from the hotel sees this, please tell me how I can find them!!!

The staff at the hotel was phenomenal - so friendly, accommodating and never pushy or snobby, which one sometimes encounters at other hotels of this caliber.  I cannot remember any staff member's name in particular, but everyone who assisted us throughout our stay was really great.

One thing I think that deserves a mention that, although an upscale property, the room service menu prices were very reasonable! We didn't order (although those parmesan truffle fries looked SO tempting), but I thought it was a nice aspect.

The hotel bar was lovely and had a great selection of wines by the glass - even a sparkling Albari√±o, which I have rarely seen. The sharing plate with the hummus, calamari, etc, was delicious and perfect for 2 with 2 glasses of wine. The buffet breakfast in the brasserie was amazing. The options were fresh and delicious and the service was, as always, fantastic.

The design of the common areas, the staff's uniforms (beautiful top hats for the doormen) and the rooms, with dark hallways and beautiful brasserie for breakfast really makes this hotel feel modern, fun and luxurious without being gaudy or dated.

Will stay here every time we are in Dublin from now on. My family lives in D4 and we normally stay near there, but they'll just need to come to the Grand Canal Dock to see us or we'll take more taxis now... because we have a new home in Dublin :)",5,2015,01,17
206,Wonderful - simply stunning ,"My husband and I spent the weekend before xmas here. The hotel excelled - we had a beautiful corner suite with stunning views over the Grand Canal.

Suite was spacious, very contemporary and modern. 

The rooftop bar is great,not really ideal for December. Even with blankets & heaters - not for us it was bitter. We did have a couple of cocktails inside which was nice. Believe spring onwards you will enjoy the views and beautiful terrace.

Hotel had a fab bar downstairs, customer service throughout stay was brilliant. 

As a added addition a infinity black granite pool & spa.....nice to chill.

Location is in the docklands area - easy to get a taxi/tram or bus.

Walk into central Dublin is 15mins plus.

The Ely restaurant and bar is nearby - trendy and modern. 

There are a couple  of other bars and restaurants.",5,2015,01,15
206,Back again. Meetings meetings meetings. ,"So. I am back here again. 

Once again the hotel proves itself as a great venue for business and pleasure. Having the ability to have secure and high speed internet just makes it for me every time. 

Having the comfortable room as well after the hard day of work really just makes it all perfect. 

I'll be back again!

Thanks!",5,2015,01,13
206,Excellent,"We stayed at the Marker for 3 nights on New Years Eve. The service we received during our stay was exceptional - nothing was too much trouble for any member of staff and everyone was extremely friendly. 

The room itself was very modern, spacious and comfortable. It was very clean and was furnished to a high standard. Each night at around 8pm, we'd have a knock on the door from one of the staff offering us drinks and chocolate and making sure everything was alright. I thought this was a very nice touch. 

The only negative throughout our whole stay was that due to the weather conditions on New Year's eve, we couldn't enjoy a drink outside on the rooftop bar (one of the reasons why we booked the hotel) and instead were crammed in to the inside bar. We were told we were next in line to be seated and we'd have to stand until then, and after standing for about 40 minutes, it appeared people who arrived after us were being offered seats instead. However, due to the excellent service we received on other occasions, this wouldn't affect our rating of the hotel nor would it affect our decision of returning.

The hotel has a gym, swimming pool, sauna and steam room. I really enjoyed using these facilities. My only comment would be that I felt that the pool didn't have enough loungers around it as each time we used the pool, all loungers were occupied. 

The hotel is about 25 minutes walk away from attractions and nightlife such as Temple Bar area and St. Stephen's Green but if you are looking for a romantic getaway that isn't in the hustle and bustle of the city centre, this is your place. 

There are 2 cafes, a Spa shop and a couple of restaurants located nearby which is quite convenient however we were unable to find any bars/pubs that stayed open past 10pm (This could be due to it being NYE/NYD)

The concierge's outside were so friendly and would go out of their way to deliver an excellent service. On New Year's Eve it was raining heavily, and they walked everyone to their taxis sheltering them with an umbrella. They were always helping us with directions and general advice on where to visit in the city.

I would definitely return to the Marker again and will recommend to anybody visiting Dublin.",5,2015,01,13
206,fabulous new year,"We stayed at the Marker Hotel Dublin with friends for three nights over the new year, our stay was excellent from beginning to end. Nothing was too much trouble and attention to detail by all the staff was second to non  The rooms were spacious and of a very high standard and although new years eve in the restaurant was obviously busy nothing was too much trouble and service was spot on.Both myself my husband and our friends have stopped in some lovely hotels in different parts of the world but this was probably one of the best.Our only small disappointment was that because of the weather [ raining and cold ] we couldnt stay up long on the roof top bar but it didn't really make much difference to our enjoyment.. and it also gives us a good excuse to return later in the year when the weather is better.",5,2015,01,09
206,Quick one night stay,"We stayed here our last night in Ireland.  Wish we could've experienced more of the hotel but we had a very early flight the next morning.  The hotel space is modern and cool.  We heard about the rooftop bar, but by the time we made it back to the hotel, it was closed.  We were totally bummed.  We had a drink in the hotel lobby bar instead.  Our service there was so-so.  We weren't well attended.  On another note, our room was chic, as one would expect.  If only we could've enjoyed it longer--I think we slept for 6 hours and then had to head to the airport.",4,2015,01,07
206,Gorgeous hotel and fantastic staff,We stayed in the Marker for one night in early January with my husband and sons and were upgraded from interconnecting rooms to a suite.  What an absolute treat and such beautifully appointed rooms - my kids are still talking about it!  The staff were wonderful from the reservation experience right through to delivering our car to the door on departure.  A brilliant stay and the staff made the experience better than 5 star!,5,2015,01,07
206,"Excellent modern upscale hotel, right opposite theatre","This is a great choice for a romantic break or theatre break in Dublin. The rooms are fantastic, there is great food and cocktails available, and a 23 metre infinity pool with spa and gym to cap it off. It is actually very good value - compare these prices to London and New York.",5,2015,01,07
206,Wonderful stay.,"My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel and we really could not fault it at all. The staff were presentable, friendly, accommodating and friendly. The room was frequently cleaned even up to twice a day. The pool was lovely and the food was delicious too. The overall decor of the reception and dining areas is lovely and welcoming. It had a really nice atmosphere there. You are about a 20 min walk to Dublin city centre and it's not the most scenic walk either but we would definitely come back to this hotel.",5,2015,01,07
206,Definitely a must if staying in Dublin,"We recently enjoyed a night at the Marker between Christmas and the New Year. The hotel decor is stunning, very modern and minimalist. The staff are excellent. From greeting us at the entrance to our departure they couldn't have been more pleasant and helpful.
The rooms are beautiful and the bathroom underfloor heating was a nice touch.
Cocktails in the bar were delicious as was the buffet breakfast. I was a bit disappointed the roof top bar was closed but honestly didn't expect it to be open on one of the coldest nights of the year!
With the theater across the road and city shops and restaurants a 10 minute walk away, I would definitely recommend a stay here.",5,2015,01,07
206,Great hotel,"We stayed in The Marker hotel for one night between Christmas and New Year. The hotel is stunning and very modern. The staff were excellent and couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. Rooms amazing, to the point we didn't want to leave. We didn't take breakfast as part of our deal as it was expensive and decided to go elsewhere and ate for probably half the price. The hotel is slightly out from Grafton Street etc, which we didn't mind as we were happy to walk in and out but if you are looking convenience then you are better staying closer to St Stephens Green. All in all loved the style and design of the hotel plus the attentive staff so would definitely stay again.",5,2015,01,06
206,Awesome hotel in the heart of the docklands,"We spent a week at this hotel with our family and loved it.  The rooms were contemporary and cosy, the service was outstanding and the restaurant/breakfast is excellent.  This is definitely a hotel you want to return to.  Finally, they have a rooftop bar that is fun and beautiful.",5,2015,01,06
206,Fantastic 5 star hotel highly recommended,"Went down to the marker for the weekend with my fianc√©, absolutely loved this hotel! 
It's in a really nice around the docklands and beside the theatre! As soon as you arrive everything is brilliant, the style of the hotel, the welcoming staff, the list goes on. Our room was lovely, so clean and modern, a huge kingsize bed and a separate bath and shower! 
The only one bad thing I could say about this hotel was how uncomfortable the pillows in our room were! Honestly felt like I was sleeping on a rock the first night, the second I found other pillows in the wardrobe and they seemed a lot better! 
The bar in the hotel is gorgeous, has a really nice comfortable feeling and the staff are very attentive and see to your every need! 
We had dinner in the hotel the first night and it was nice too. 
On the Saturday we used the spa, I had a back massage and a facial and my fianc√© had a back massage, they were both really nice and done by lovely staff!
We used the spa facilities after which were amazing and everything is spotless and clean.
Would definitely stay in this hotel again, the last time I was in Dublin we stayed in the merrion but I definitely preferred the marker",5,2015,01,05
206,Good stay but some issues,"We stayed at The Marker for 4 nights over the New Year. The hotel itself is lovely and very modern. We arrived at 9am after an early flight and expected to have to leave our bags until our room was ready. However we were told we could go straight to our room which was a brilliant start. We stayed in a room overlooking the docklands which was large and had a lovely bathroom. Town is a 20 minute walk away and over the 4 days we only got a taxi twice (due to the rain) so don't be put off by location as it is a nice walk. 
We did have a couple of issues however. House keeping only cleaned our room around 4pm on 2 days. I understand that they were busy during this period but after a full day around Dublin we just wanted to get back to our room to relax and not have to vacate our room.   At 6pm we then got a knock for turn down service. 
We did eat in the Brasserie on New Year's Day and enjoyed a lovely meal. The service was good until it came to paying the bill. We waited 10 minutes for the waitress to bring the bill and a further 20 minutes for them to take it away. There was only 3 other tables being waited on and all the other staff were busy setting up for breakfast it seemed. 
These are only small issues but ones that you wouldn't expect from a luxury 5 star hotel.",4,2015,01,05
206,New year recharge break,"We stayed for 3 nights at the Marker - we were emailed  before our stay welcoming us and asking if there was anything that could be could be done for us in preparation for our stay, I informed Deirdre Dwyer by email that we were arriving at approximately 10 am and would it be possible to have an earlier check in - she replied promptly that she couldn't guarantee this but would try their best to accommodate us - on arrival we were able to check in - very impressed!! Lovely hotel, pool and spa area fab!! It's situated in the docklands area with a few lovely local restaurants/caf√©s.  The hotel staff could not be more welcoming, pleasant and helpful",5,2015,01,05
206,Great hotel but mediocre location,"We stayed one night at this hotel. 'Great rooms, great service, beautiful rooftop bar with incredible city views. My only con is the location. It requires a cab ride to Temple Bar area and other attractions. I would highly recommend this hotel for business travelers and for those who truly want luxury. However, if location is your preference then find a hotel closer to attractions.",5,2015,01,04
206,Very Good Hotel,"we had a one night stay in the Marker and availed of the spa treatments and swimming pool.
The hotel is a new five star facility which is very well positioned in the docklands close to the Board Gais Energy Theatre and a 20 minute walk to O'Connell street.
The breakfast was good and the staff and service were excellent.
Our bedroom was also of a very high standard of which you would expect from a five star hotel.
Definitely return sometime.",4,2015,01,04
206,New Year in Dublin,"Beautiful hotel in the dockland area of Dublin. 

Staff always professional, polite, courteous and welcoming. 

Hotel room was spotlessly clean with all the facilities one would hope for.  The view was OK but we would have preferred a view of the front of the hotel.  Really handy for the Bord Gais Theatre though the city centre was a 20 minute walk along the Liffey. The walk was lovely in good weather! The surrounding area of the hotel was great too - there was a very well stocked supermarket just a short distance away (Fresh supermarket). There was also a very nice deli too and Italian bakery and coffee shop. 

The breakfast was fabulous,  tasty and freshly made.  It was such a relaxing environment and staff deserve a special mention too as they were so friendly and nothing was too much trouble.  Bar food was tasty but expensive as were the drinks. That said it was all an enjoyable and memorable experience and if we are in Dublin again we would certainly not hesitate to stay there. It was all first class and testament to the hard working and conscientious staff to make visitors feel so welcome. ",5,2015,01,03
206,Nice hotel for a one-off stay,"Stayed here for one night in July - rooms are funky. Breakfast was slightly disappointing for a 5 star hotel. There are very few common areas to lounge about in.

Swimming pool was cool and stylish.

Rooftop terrace is worth a visit if slightly pretentious.",3,2015,01,02
206,The Best!!,"We stayed here for 2 nights between Christmas and New Year. It was one of the best hotels to stay in. The staff were amazing, nothing was too much trouble. We really felt so welcome and were superbly looked after. The food is so delicious - just a super hotel.",5,2014,12,31
206,Best place I have stayed since living in California,"the hotel is new and I can say that I had a brilliant experience. All the staff were friendly and really helpful, I used the chauffeured car one day to head into town and Zoltan our driver is a true asset to this hotel with information he gave me and my partner.
The food at breakfast was good and of a good standard I used room service on 2 of the mornings it arrived at the allotted time and again it was very good. Food in the bar was excellent service was very good as well. I would recommend  this hotel  to anyone as it so good. The Spa and pool are very relaxing service again was brilliant.
All staff are so helpful a credit to the hotel I will be returning very soon..!!!",5,2014,12,31
206,Wish I Could Add in More Stars,"This hotel is absolutely amazing. The service... from getting a last-minute reservation, to a friendly check-in and check-out at even 3 am were hands-down perfect.

The room was just gorgeous. A wonderful soaking tub -- perfect after a long day of work and traveling. Everything was clean and well-arranged. The technology available through the tv/wifi was fantastic and even the in-room coffeemaker was clever and tasty.

And honestly, I can't say enough about room service, the quality of the food and the menu available. Delivered quickly and fresh from the stove -- all of the food was fantastic. As someone who also grew up in Kentucky, I was particularly taken by the Kentucky-based craft beer selection available.

Can't recommend more highly.",5,2014,12,29
206,Exceptional staff,"Stayed for one night in early December with a friend and got a great rate. It's pricey but good value based on the spacious room and excellent customer service. Front desk professional and very friendly, as were everyone else we encountered. Although it was busy and there was a little buzz about the place, it is very modern and therefore I felt a little soulless. Rooftop bar was freeeeezing but a hot water bottle, blanket, delicious cocktails and lovely friendly service made it all very bearable.  It's not in the heart of Dublin and that is the only reason I would hesitate staying again. Highly recommended.",4,2014,12,29
206,Excellent,"Simply excellent on every level from the warm welcome, the service in the restaurant, the stunning and delicious food, the luxurious rooms to the location. Highly recommended for business and pleasure, a great place to stay and relax in Dublin.  ",5,2014,12,29
206,Stunning hotel,"We stayed here recently for a one night break,from the moment we arrived we were impressed from the friendly valet parking to the welcome we recieved,our room was lovely modern & stylish just like the rest of the hotel,we dined in the brasserie,the service & food were both perfect we went to the theatre & returned to our room to find that staff had visited leaving chocolates & slippers,simple yet lovely touch,we enjoyed drinks in the stylish hotel bar that night,the breakfast delivered to our room in the morning was one of our highlights absolutely delicious & very well presented,we then finished our stay by relaxing in the spa for a while,again very modern stylish & relaxing,all in all 10/10,thank you marker staff for making our stay so enjoyable.",5,2014,12,28
206,"Stayed there for 6 months, still wanted more","I stayed in this hotel for 6 months for business purposes, so I came to know if quite well. It's an excellent place.

First of all, service. At all levels - from the doormen, to receptionists, to waiters and the hotel manager himsels - it is impeccable. They always make you feel as if they are elated you cared to stop by, and are extremely creative and flexible in serving your wishes.

Secondly - the feel. It is a modern, upbeat vibe. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, tastefully decorated. Bathrooms are great.

Thirdly - food. Expect great standards from both the Brasserie, as well as room service and the bar.

And fourthly - the spa. The near-full length swimming pool, the sauna and the steam room provide a great atmosphere to chill out in.

If you want more, there is the rooftop bar, conference space, the business room and probably more!

Were there some problems over my 6-month long stay? Yes, but they were fixed quickly an professionally.

Overall, a great experience and I remain under great impression of this hotel.",5,2014,12,26
206,Excellent hotel,Excellent hotel in the heart of Dublin. From the start the staff could not have been more helpful right from checking in. The rooms are great with an amazing marble bathroom. The restaurant and roof bar is a must see........................,5,2014,12,22
206,Exellent,"Go there when you go to Dublin - very nice place, very nice people, rooftop bar, good breakfast - we booked on tripadvisor and got a free update, then we upgraded to a suite (top floor in the corner - huge) and had a wonderful time.",5,2014,12,22
206,Tad overrated and overpriced but good!,"Great location, stylish, modern hotel. Rooms are nicely decorated, beautiful bathroom, comfortable bed. Was a bit strange that upon arrival there was a daily deposit charged/secured from our card. Used the spa section only once, but it' s very nice, clean, has sauna and steam rooms, as well as nice pool and jacuzzi. Not enough beds, so if it is busy no chance to relax after swimming. Breakfast is really good, large choice of cold and hot breakfast meals, but they need to improve on the egg benedict!",4,2014,12,21
206,"Ultra modern decor, ina great hotel","We stayed just one night but I was very taken with the hotel.
It looks more like an art gallery than a hotel. Ultra modern with very interesting decor, in truly unusual style. Very different from the standard , classic Dublin hotels.
Staff very helpful.
Lifts a little complicated with key entry, but the rooms very well appointed and great beds. 
The breakfast is a buffet, but very good quality.
It is in the new regenerated dock area, but very well worth a visit.
",4,2014,12,19
206,Slick hotel,"Checked in early after a red eye flight from Boston.  Friendly staff welcomed me at the curb and at Reception.  Clean room with beautiful carerra marble bath, plenty of plush towels and peppermint-scented bath soaps. Cool vibe and great coffee in Marker Bar - suit and tie crowd.  ",4,2014,12,16
206,Amazing,I only stayed one night but this hotel was beautiful . The room was large with an enormous comfortable bed and lovely bathroom but my husband managed to flood the floor thinking it was s wet room and I slipped on the marble . The spa was amazing and treatments lovely. ,5,2014,12,15
206,Let down by the chilly bar and menus,"This is a shiny new hotel in the little docklands development about 15 minutes out of town. Handy for local theatre, concert and sports venues, not so good if you want to be in the middle of things. But we went for a relaxing spa weekend, so the location was perfect for us.

What I liked:

- Stylish and comfortable rooms, lots of space & seating. Well equipped - including a proper hair dyer, iron & ironing board.
- Massive, swanky bathroom with huge bath and separate shower
- Friendly and attentive staff, welcoming to all (it was a mixed crowd of guests, not really a trendy crowd that the styling of the place might suggest)
- The pool is to die for - really huge for a hotel pool, plus steam room, sauna and massive jacuzzi pool big enough for a crowd (6/5 for the pool)
- Top notch spa, was incredibly well looked after and had the best massage ever (7/5 for the spa). It's not cheap, but it's worth every penny - would go to the spa again in the blink of an eye

What I didn't like:
- little things like not being able to open windows & temperamental lifts (but can live with that)
- the really big let down for me was the bar & restaurant on the ground floor. Firstly, it's freezing in there and this put us off staying longer (we had to go up to our room to warm up), food options are well below what we expected (veggie options almost non existent and everything else just OK) and the restaurant was closed in the evening. This is a deal breaker for me, it's what would stop me going again.

Our food disappointments were eased by the lovely Herb Street cafe across the road but (with the exception of a Pizza Express and a sandwich bar) that's all there is nearby.

Such a shame the public areas, bar and food didn't match up to the room, pool and spa or we'd be regulars here.",3,2014,12,14
206,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING,Fantastic experience. Staff were second to none. Obviously a lot of hard work goes into recruitment and training. Would not stay anywhere else......and the rooms are spotless. I will be coming back to Dublin and will always stay at the Marker. Well Done,5,2014,12,14
206,Sensational stay! Won't stay anywhere else!,"Fifth visit to this hotel and it just gets better and better every time!! Lili the guest relations manager went above and beyond to make my birthday visit extra special! Staying in the Presidential Suite my friends and I felt like superstars! Beautiful rooms with our own dining room, living room and a bathroom each with lovely finishing touches such as scented candles, heated flooring, welcome letter and handmade chocolates!! We will most definitely be back again soon! Festive wishes to the whole Marker team! xXx ",5,2014,12,13
206,Absolutely Outstanding - Cannot recommend highly enough,"I will start by saying that I have off the charts expectations re hotels / airlines / service etc. I travel a huge amount and stay in countless hotels every month. The Marker has been an experience that far surpassed my expectations.

I wanted a special night in DUB and was looking at the Shelbourne, Merrion and Marker. I opted for the Marker due the pool (I lap swim and only stay in hotels with a proper, rectangular pool. I told you I was demanding).

Anyway, from arrival to departure everything was superb. The staff - every single one - were engaging, smart, polite, attentive - just great. The decor was stunning and the interior designer has done a great job. Colours, layout, room style - great. I used the lobby bar for coffee / work in the afternoon (great latte's, tasteful complimentary mini mince pies), then later for drinks. Buzzy atmosphere and great service. I used the restaurant for breakfast which again was faultless (trust me - I never use this word).

The pool is brilliant. Great colours, ambient music, perfect for lap swimming.

The icing on the cake however, came when i returned home a few hours later. I received and email to say lost property had been found in the room and to please call the hotel. When I did this, it transpires ‚Ç¨100 had been found and they would get it returned to me etc. FANTASTIC service. The room attendant could have easily pocketed that and it clearly says a lot about the calibre of the team working at The Marker that this action was taken.

Lastly, cabs in DUB are frequent and cheap so you're only a 10 min / ‚Ç¨8 cab ride to town.

Stay here - you'll love it! :-)",5,2014,12,13
206,Loved the atmosphere and welcome,"Great welcome form the staff who were very attentive. The food was lovely and the place was lively.
The room was delightful and the attention to detail great. Enjoyed it immensely. One little peeve the food in the bar was served at coffee table height not the most comfortable to eat at but otherwise loved it. Ideal location for going to the theatre next door.",5,2014,12,13
206,Great hotel. Poor restaurant.,"Not our first stay at this hotel so knew what to expect from it. 
Staff throughout are excellent and the accommodation is most definitely 5*.
What really spoilt our stay however was our decision to dine in on a wet winter night rather than seek out a good Dublin restaurant. 
Four of us all picked different dishes from a smallish menu. The lamb and steak both arrived undercooked. The vegetarian option was bland to put it mildly and the pork was simply a mistake. The meal concluded with a whimper when we were served 2 cold Irish coffees. 
Had we not been entertaining guests I would have challenged the bill which would have been on the high side for a very good meal but was almost laughable for what we endured. 
When the only 2 good aspects of the meal are the basket of bread and a well chosen wine you have to think that management are asleep at the helm.
My strong recommendation therefore is stay at this great hotel but eat anywhere but here.
",4,2014,12,13
206,Perfect,"Stayed one night in this hotel and it was perfect.  The room was spotlessly clean and the beds were so comfy.  Best nights sleep i have had in a hotel for a long time.  The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.  The full Irish Breakfast is up there with the best full Scottish breakfast! We did not have very much time to spare in dublin as the sole purpose of the visit was a concert across the road.  The hotel has a courtesy car which we were able to use to take us to an attraction in the city centre.  Most helpful.  If i had to give a criticism it would be that we could not get served drinks when we returned to the hotel later in the evening....we thought guests would still get drinks after ""closing time"" albeit in their room but that was not to be the case.  The mini bar, as with all hotels, was expensive.

We were delighted the rooftop bar was open earlier in the evening and we enjoyed a couple of cocktails.  Immaculately tidy, blankets supplied if required (can be a bit chilly) and cheery, friendly, professional staff (found this throughout our stay at the hotel).

I will definitely visit dublin again and for a much longer visit and i would not hesitate to stay at this hotel.  We loved it.",5,2014,12,12
206,Brilliant Hotel!,I recently stayed at The Marker for a 2 night stay and was pleasantly surprised. The hotel boasts a great location with a short walk into the town center and local amenities. The reception staff was very helpful upon checking in and for the duration of my stay. All local taxi drivers mentioned its a great hotel and I cant agree more. Will be looking to return in the near future. Thank you :),5,2014,12,10
206,Great staff!,"We recently spent 4 nights at the Marker and were impressed with the warmth and sincerity of the staff.  Everyone expressed interest in how we were spending our time in Dublin, asking us if we had enjoyed various restaurants and our activites, sharing their own suggestions, and of course offering the services of the hotel at all times.

The rooms are spacious and immaculate, nice turndown with chocolates, beds are comfortable, some rooms face inward with minimal light. 
However, for anyone with allergy issues, note that the housekeeping staff is required to use a very strongly scented room deodorizing spray when they clean the rooms. As it caused me to have an allergic reaction, the manager graciously moved us to another ( and upgraded) spray free room when it was ready and housekeeping did not use the spray for the duration of our stay.

As another reviewer noted, it can be difficult to find seats in the bar area, especially on evenings when there is a performance at the center across the street. However, apparently bar tables can be reserved.  And, the bar staff, like everyone else, was friendly and upbeat.

The Docklands location was an easy walk to downtown Dublin to see the sights, have dinner, etc. Also, right aroung the corner from the hotel is Lolly & Cooks for reasonably priced coffee, scones and other quick breakfast and bakery items.",4,2014,12,09
206,Great hotel ,"I've stayed in many Dublin hotels over the years; Hilton, Westin, Doubletree, Maldron, Bewley's, etc. but the Marker is the best. Lovely rooms, great spa/pool and staff who really try to 'go the extra mile'. I've not eaten in the restaurant but the rooftop bar definitely worth a trip.",5,2014,12,09
206,Anniversary weekend away,"We stayed here recently for our first wedding anniversary! I cannot say enough great things about this hotel ! The rooms are beautiful, spacious bathrooms with bath, separate shower and underfloor heating !! The pool and spa facilities are also amazing! We found the staff so friendly and very helpful. The buffet breakfast exceeded our expectations - we are both from Dublin but really felt like we were on holidays abroad. Can't wait to visit here again : D ",5,2014,12,09
206,Excellent,"My wife and I stayed at the Marker last week end for two nights and were impressed by this modern hotel. We have stayed in some great hotels across the world and we believe the staff at the Marker are the best that we have ever experienced.
One downside is the lack of seating facilities in the bar area. Having returned from the 3Arena after a concert we wanted a drink but as there were no seats it wasnt possible.
That aside we were very happy with this hotel",5,2014,12,09
206,Very good modern hotel,I stayed here for one night on a business trip. It's in a relatively recently developed part of town on the south side of the river opposite the various office developments on the other side which are accessible within 5-10 minutes over the footbridge. The Marker is located in the smart looking Grand Canal Square development and is an imposing building.  I had a superior room which was large and comfortable. The foyer bar area proved a good area for a meeting - wasn't there long enough to sample the food but was generally impressed with the quality of the hotel and the helpful service. ,5,2014,12,07
206,Relaxing Luxury and Friendliness,We spent a wonderful night at the Marker hotel to attend a show in the 3 Arena. We really enjoyed our stay. The room was gorgeous with no expense spared and attention to detail all over. The bathroom was exquisite. We had a beautiful view of Grand Canal Square from our window. The staff were extremely helpful without being in your face. Unfortunately we didn't get to try the rooftop bar or restaurant but that'll just give us an excuse to go back!!! The one downside was that we were only there for one night. Until next time Marker.....,5,2014,12,06
206,"The Marker is a ""Must Stay""","I originally planned on staying at a hotel in city center Dublin but when I read about the Marker Hotel and the new Grand Canal Square Project, I changed my plans. That turned out to be the best decision. I love the Marker hotel at the Grand Canal! It's super modern yes, and also warm and cozy too. There's a lovely fireplace with comfy couches in the lounge that overlooks the canal. The bedrooms are fabulous..and the beds are heaven. Breakfast is amazing...dinner as well! The pool, the spa, and the rooftop bar keep you in shape..coiffed and quenches your thirst for good drinks and amazing view. Choose a room with canal view at least 3 floors up overlooking the Square. The Square is full of exciting new businesses with restaurants, bars and shopping! The taxis to city center are plentiful and the bus stops are a two minute walk away. Take the comfortable Aircoach from the airport for 6‚Ç¨. I want to thank concierge Robert and evening client relations Andre (from Portugal) overnight guest relations! They are wonderful gentlemen who will see to it that your comfort and daily needs are met to the highest level. ",5,2014,12,05
206,Good business hotel,"Chose this hotel as it was very close to the office. The surrounding area is what I would call the business district and would say the hotel is aimed at the Business traveller and couples. The staff were incredibly friendly and you will receive a very warm welcome. There is real attention to detail in this hotel and the room, which had a bath and shower also came with underfloor heating (Room 607). I didn't get a chance to explore the hotel or the bar, as there were a number of functions going on. I ordered a room service breakfast that was good but nothing to write home about but a reasonable price compared to some hotels so the breakfast area may be a better option. One tip, if you book breakfast on arrival it also cheaper than just turning up and giving them your room number. The hotel is also right next door to the Theatre. I am a light sleeper and heard quite a few people returning to their rooms between 2 and 4am which surprised me for a Wednesday and I have had beds in recent hotels that I found more comfortable. Would visit here again",4,2014,12,05
206,Amazing hotel!,"I am not sure what I loved the most, the cleanest toilets I have ever seen, friendly perfect staff, a bartender in worldclass, great room, great bathroom, comfy beds, good minibar and so on. The staff was very attentive, bringing you olives and nuts for free in the bar section, and the serving was fast. We are going back this spring, I can't wait! Dublin is also an amazing city, such friendly people.  I had planned to visit many cities around Europe, but I fell in love with Dublin so I will just keep going there often instead <3<3<3<3",5,2014,12,05
206,Wonderful hotel,"Really enjoyed staying for 4 days at The Marker. The swimming pool is a treat, as are the related facilities. The bedroom was a great size, wifi worked perfectly, and the bed was comfortable too.Staff were very friendly.",5,2014,12,04
206,Back again...   and thanks!,"Recently stayed at the hotel again on business.   Once again I found the staff to be professional, helpful and above all pleasant to deal with.

Thank you again to the staff, and I will be back in February 2015 for a Valentines weekend!   Can't wait!",5,2014,12,04
206,Magnificent location and fabulous facilities,"I stayed for a few nights at The Marker on business and had an extremely pleasant experience. The room was amazing, the breakfast legendary and the swimming pool/sauna really relaxing. The staff were very helpful and I will return - on business and for a weekend with my wife and family. Oh, and on the Saturday evening I had dinner - a recommendation from a lady in the pool who was telling me just how brilliant the chef is - it was a superb meal. Interesting combinations of food and flavours. A great contrast to the usual hustle/bustle and pubs of Dublin city.
My only regret is that I didn't get to see the rooftop bar. Next time....",5,2014,12,03
206,"Hospitality, Grace, and Location. It does not get better.","Stay here if you want hospitality, grace, and a warm welcome from everyone working there. General Manager Charlie Sheil has set a tone and environment that is classy, cool, chic and inviting.
From the bar to the restaurant, from the Spa to the pool, it is clean, well-laid out, and populated with friendly, polite, and professional people of all nations. Staying anywhere in Dublin these days means that you are in an International City. Trinity University bringing students from across the continent, and international Tech Firms (indeed, Facebook, others) bring youth, verve, and energy. The Marker invites, houses, and refreshes them all. Walk from the hotel across the square to the canal, and see swans floating almost year round. Walk two short, historic blocks, and you are either enjoying very good food, or on Samuel Beckett Bridge. 
The Marker ... marks the spot ... for where to stay, meet, and eat in Dublin.",5,2014,12,02
206,"Bad experience overall, not 5 star follow through","I stayed in the Marker on a much awaited family trip with my mother and sister. Though we enjoyed our night in the hotel, and the pool and spa are certainly luxurious, I was disappointed in the fact that though it is clearly a 5 star hotel with 5 star prices to match, the staffing appears not up to scratch.
Unfortunately I left a wallet behind in the room when I checked out at noon. I  live in the UK so keep a separate wallet for euro and sterling. As soon as I realised (4pm) I rang the hotel (wrong phone number printed on my receipt) and asked them to check the room. Despite no new guests using the room they didn't locate the wallet. It had been a gift from my husband and had quite a lot of cash in it so not really surprising that someone lifted it but I had to ring the hotel many times to follow up on this with no success. I would have hoped that retrieving something left behind wouldn't have been impossible. The hotel did have someone respond to my emails but he just insisted that the 'integrity' of the hotel was beyond reproach, and referred me to the police.",2,2014,12,02
206,Wonderful Anniversary Weekend at the Marker,"We have just returned from celebrating our anniversary at the Marker, from the time of booking to departure the attention to detail was brilliant. The staff really go out their way to ensure you feel special which many hotels do not. The facilities at the hotel were superb, we loved the rooftop bar and the spa. The pool and treatment facilities were superb, we even got a sorbet and smoothie whilst relaxing after our massages. There was a slight complication with part of our spa booking but the manager went completely out of his way to make sure we were properly compensated and arrangements were made.

The rooms were probably the least impressive part of the hotel, although they were still nice. The bed wasn't especially comfortable compared to other five star hotels around the world. As mentioned in other reviews there is a lack of storage (only 2 drawers we could find and a small wardrobe with only hanging space.) There is also a lack of plug sockets available. The ipod docking system is actually only a charger and lamp, it would have been nice to actually play music in the room. The hotel have a TV phone link to stream music, unfortunately this didn't work (QR code didn't scan). There aren't many gadgets in the room which wasn't a real issue and the makeup mirror in the bathroom wasn't height adjustable (set at about the right height for someone who is 6ft). Not 5ft like my girlfriend. Again none of these were issues. The food in the hotel and room service were fairly mediocre (Cold brownies and pizza for the sum of about ‚Ç¨40). 

Any of the negatives however were completely outweighed by the positives so this really didn't bother us too much. The staff especially including the manager, Fiona on reservations, Stephan & Robert on concierge were brilliant, the friendly, informative, personal touch really goes a long way! We would definitely come back again in the future.",4,2014,12,01
206,VIP treatment all the way...,"An ultra chic modern and sophisticated hotel with an unbelievable service level. We felt like VIPs all the way from the valet parking ( and presentation pineapple and ginger hot punch ) to the valet check in, to the amazing spa area with tranquil lighting, to the rooftop bar with views over the Liffey and Grand Canal and ultimately to the car being delivered back to the door ( with complementary bottles of mineral water installed into the cup holders for our journey home ).  Everything about this hotel is better than you would expect. They have thought of everything but above all, I believe that the staff here must have a very very good management team behind them, as they were clearly happy in their work, and I felt as though this was personal for them, not just a job, a level of self satisfaction and pride in being part of this experience. They have raised the bar in terms of service.",5,2014,11,30
206,Top notch hotel,"We spent a night here recently while celebrating a family event. All were very impressed. Our group included 8 children and the staff went the extra mile to keep them happy and contented. The rooftop bar had a splendid view over the canal and the city and was supplied with heaters and rugs to keep us warm. The location on Grand Canal square is in the newly developed part of Dublin and has some interesting structures such as Samuel Beckett bridge- design based on the harp- the Theatre and the Convention Centre. A five minute taxi ride , costing about ‚Ç¨5 has one in trendy Temple Bar or Grafton Street. Overall a very enjoyable experience- would highly recommend this hotel",5,2014,11,30
206,"Super modern, super service","well now, what a nice surprise at the Marker - it looked nice and rather lovely from the website but this is top hotel experience and twinned with the best bar in dublin on the roof, must be on your list of places to stay. As in at the top.

As long as you like modern and smart, this hotel has the facilities spot on - spa, pool, our room was spot on for a basic twin was large and quiet, but where this place gets it, is the people. Some hotels Ive reviewed here are soulless - from the doorman you first meet, to the reception staff who could not do enough (hot towel and beverage on arrival) to the assistant manager who I had a chat to in the lift, very nice chap, these folk aim to exceed, and they do.

But the gem is the roof bar - put it this way, we went last week, lots of rain and cold, but we still went up, staff spot on, wine just so, attention to detail which you do not find - feels 5 star, but not pretentious at all, hard to pull off.

If we return we will be back, add in its 20 min walk to the centre, and a decent bar over the road as an option plus the food is great, and you're on to a winner.",5,2014,11,29
206,"Exciting, Modern, Trendy, Super Cool","I would rank this hotel in my Top 5 hotels I've stayed in the world. I go for modern, trendy hotels as a solo travels as suppose to ones geared towards families and tourists. The hotel opened this year and it stands among the traditional hotels in Dublin. My single room was huge! Plenty of amenities. The spa and boom were so great. I used it every day. Since it's off season, I got a 3 nights get the 4th free deal. Boom! The rooftop bar gets crowded fast so plan accordingly. Now, the location. I wanted something away from the tourist center/Temple Bar. The Marker is by the docklands away from city center. It's a 20-25 minute walk. So you'll need to use the buses or taxis, which are plenty. I loved the hotel so much, I didn't mind it because Temple Bar is a tourist hellhole and loud every night.",5,2014,11,27
206,Top notch,"Very cool ultra-modern hotel with a super location. It's not exactly cheap by any means but I must admit the service is very good. The style of the hotel is modern and sleek, the rooms are beautiful, very spacious and the roof top bar is impressive. Breakfast finishes at 10.00 am sharp and is quite good but they let themselves down on the coffee, seemed cheap to me. Lovely location in the Grand Canal Square and it's within strolling distance of Pearse Street and then right in to Dublin City. Overall I'd recommend this hotel if you got a few quid to spend.",4,2014,11,26
206,Lovely Hotel,"Yes this place does what it says on the tin. Just went in for a few cocktails. The place is in a great location, great staff and wonderful setting in the heart of Dublin. Beautiful surroundings with chic style and cool interiors. Very impressed with the place but you would pay a little extra for the few drinks but I think its worth every penny. Would recommend it to our lovely visitors in our beautiful town. If you like my review please press the like review button.",4,2014,11,24
206,"good, but not a 5 star!","OK so there are some good things about this hotel - The bar is nice and they make great cocktails. Also the building is a cool design  and the shower/bathroom was amazing, the toiletries were nice....and that's about it! Here is what was not so good.... 1. The rooms are clearly designed WITHOUT a woman in mind - there was no good lighting and no plug sockets near mirrors...a nightmare for styling hair/applying make up and very impractical!....2. the front desk seems disorganised - At check in we got handed a chip and pin machine and had to pay ¬£40 sterling without the staff member explaining clearly what it was actually for. Instead he was distracting us with small talk. It was only afterwards that we realised that it was some sort of deposit for the room (what 5 star hotel does that?!?!?!) ....Also, when we checked out, the front desk was very busy with no queue control. A woman (who I assume was a manager as she was wearing plain clothes) came up to us to advise that we were all sorted and she took our room keys. I asked if there was anything to sign, for expenses from the bar, or anything else to complete. She said no and that it was all sorted and settled (I assumed they still had my card details from check in to settle the account). She then left and I realised that I wanted a receipt for expenses. I went up to another girl behind the desk (in uniform) and asked for this. She then asked for payment and I explained that the manager had sorted it. To cut a long story short....the staff seem unable to effectively communicate to their customers and advise of how they operate! In the end the manager came back out to advise that she was going to email an invoice for payment after we had left, as this was quicker when the front desk is busy. At no point did she explain any of this to us when she took our room keys - she was clearly just trying to get the front desk area cleared quickly without any regard for customers needs - really disappointing! This hotel may have a 5 star design but the service really let it down....I have stayed in other 5 star hotels in the UK and there is no way that I would rate this hotel to the same level.....its good, but its not great!",3,2014,11,23
206,A Mark of Excellence,"We stayed at the Marker on a Birthday weekend on their Sunday night deal ‚Äì and while this is certainly an expensive treat, the level of service, the style and the whole experience made it worth every penny. 
We arrived on a mild July evening ‚Äì check in was a breeze, the lady on reception couldn‚Äôt have been friendlier, asking with genuine interest where we were from and why we were there. We mentioned it was our birthday weekend, and later we were sent 2 glasses of Prosecco to our room, which was such a great touch.
The room itself is slick, spotless and modern. We were greeted with a personalized note and delicious tiramisu. The Bed was like a cloud, the view onto the dock itself was edgy and different and the bathroom was huge. 
We made use of the rooftop bar on our stay, and yes the cocktails are expensive but the views afforded over Dublin are amazing. Plus as residents in the hotel they are more flexible in letting you up to the rooftop and enjoy the cocktail a little past closing. 
I loved every little luxurious element of our stay at the Marker ‚Äì but the stand out of all the excellent details (the turndown service, the swimming pool and the robes) were definitely the staff. They are friendly, engaging and not fussy. The Marker is a special place, perfect for special occasions!",5,2014,11,23
206,Wonderful weekend at The Marker,"Just back from a flying visit to Dublin for a big family gathering.  Booked the Trip Advisor offer & we all had upgraded rooms & great breakfast as part of this (we had an added bonus of a further upgrade to the vast & luxurious Presidential Suite).  From the minute we arrived, the staff were very obliging and really went the extra mile to make our stay relaxing & enjoyable.  Rooms were spacious (Fiona in reservations was excellent & made sure all our requirements were looked after when we booked, including extra pull out beds) with everything you'd expect from a 5* hotel (make sure you request one overlooking the canal for great views).  Sandra, Roderick and the rest of the team in the restaurant looked after us brilliantly & we enjoyed a long Sunday lunch ... The Marker call it 'Le Drunch' (think brunch with a twist & chilled music from the DJ).  We were a big group with children & the hotel made them feel welcome too - colouring with the meal, able to move around without stressing, good kids menu & staff who seemed to care about every member of the party.  So much more I could add ... the cool roof terrace (OK it was a bit cold but the blankets, heaters & warm port helped), great spa & pool (with family swim times), great location (a good 15 mins walk into the city but the Grand Canal area is a good area in its own right) ... in summary, this hotel works whether you're a couple getting away for a cool weekend, a family group or on business.  We will be back! ",5,2014,11,23
206,Family christening,"What a lovely hotel and very friendly and efficient staff. We gathered here for a family christening, the hotel is situated in the Docklands area, just a taxi ride to Trinity and Temple Bar area.We were made very welcome had beautiful room very high standard and modern, the bathroom was to die for lovely toiletries too. Excellent food I could go on and on can't wait to return. It was just brilliant. Were offered complementary biscuits with coffee and nibbles with our drinks. Lovey pool area which is complementary if you are staying at the hotel.",5,2014,11,23
206,"wow, wow, wow!!!!","WHAT A HOTEL!!!

I've just returned from a two night business stay at this hotel, and was totally impressed with everything.

Where to start...

The room (210). Huge, modern, very well appointed, great view and a fantastic bathroom with beautiful products (shame they weren't in large bottles as with the toilets and the spa changing rooms though). It had absolutely everything i needed. 

The staff : everyone was helpful, professional and friendly. In all departments. 

The spa : OMG. Large, great selection of amenities. I loved my 60 minute full body massage. The pool is a really good length and not too cold. The sauna, steam and jacuzzi are all a good size and very lovely. Large, well equipped gym. Smart changing room with good products etc etc. Absolutely wonderful spa. 

Bar and restaurant: wonderful, tasty food. Great service. Breakfast selection excellent (changes daily).

Business centre: REALLY very good. We had a good sized room, well equipped and with good AC. 

Honestly, I couldn't fault this hotel. I would definitely recommend it, and would stay again when I'm next in Dublin, hopefully for leisure reasons so I can savour it more!!!",5,2014,11,23
206,Amazing service,"I stayed here for 1 night and have to say that I was very impressed, the hotel looked amazing and all the staff were very well presented, they were also a quite attentive, several times staff dropped what they were doing just to  check that I was being looked after, my room was not ready when I went to check in as the hotel was busy buy we were offered complimentary drinks in the bar as we waitied which was nice, we were also offered a complimentary upgrage to a bigger room. The room we had was very nice indeed, the decor was lovely and modern, the room was very well presented and very very comfortable, the facilities were fabulous. Yes this hotel is a little bit pricey however you really do get what you pay for, I cannot wait to stay here again.",5,2014,11,23
206,"Beautiful, Modern Hotel","I spent 4 nights at the Marker during a 2-week trip to Ireland and Scotland and it was by far the best place I stayed. It's incredibly modern and has beautiful amenities - the spa, pool, and gym were great, and the restaurant was fantastic for breakfast. The rooms are beautiful - spacious, comfortable. I live in NY and have lived in studio apartments smaller than that bathroom - the bathroom was ridiculously nice. The bed was comfortable, and our room had great view of the Docklands area. 

It's not necessarily in the middle of the touristy or city center area, but it was incredibly convenient to get to where we wanted to go - a 5-10 minute, reasonably cheap cab ride to Temple Bar and other restaurants and bar areas. It was also pretty close 20 minute walk to Trinity College.

The staff was also very welcoming and accommodating. 

Hated to leave, looking forward to going back.",5,2014,11,19
206,"Good , but not 5 stars .","This hotel was billed a bright new light on the horizon for Dublin hotels , it came close with the decor and general classy look , but fell short on atmosphere and character . I have stayed in the Merrion Hotel recently and it ticked all the boxes. Maybe in a few years the Marker can step and become one a more refined and atmospheric place to stay , but for now it feels a bit sterile . The staff were professional and courteous. The location wasn't as central as I would like and I felt a bit closed off from the city.",3,2014,11,19
206,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed here for a girls weekend recently and couldn't have chosen a better hotel. It was perfectly located for the city centre and the 3Arena being halfway between them. Being that bit further from the centre of things meant that it was very quiet at night, and yet we were only 15 minutes walk from all the shops, restaurants, bars etc. The staff were, without exception, all very pleasant and helpful - which you would expect in a hotel of this rating. The rooms were very spacious and the bathrooms were enormous with under floor heating. For those not used to this, be careful as it can get quite hot if you put it on too high! The breakfast was extremely good value and of very good quality and quantity. You must use the Spa if staying here. The pool is 23 metres ( so a bit of exercise can be had) and was so relaxing I could have spent all day there. On the Saturday night the bar was packed which led to a great atmosphere (not something that usually occurs in large hotel bars). I can't recommend this place enough and I can't wait for another excuse to go back to Dublin so that I can stay there again. As for a previous reviewer saying that it could be in any city anywhere, the Irish staff and their friendliness meant you couldn't forget you were in Dublin.",5,2014,11,19
206,Modern,"This hotel is very modern in style comparing with most of other hotels in Dublin. 
The rooms are spacious and include everything you need. Bathrooms are also very big a super nice. 
The view over grand canal dock is lovely.
Located in the new area of Dublin it is very good for business travel being close to Google and other big companies. 
Room service is good and fast. 
Restaurant is acceptable but not the best choice.",4,2014,11,19
206,Charmless,"Beautifully maintained, very professional staff, luxurious room, but completely without charm. This is the place for people visiting Ireland who don't want to be there. We felt isolated from city center. Cold and sterile.",4,2014,11,18
206,Great Addition to Dublin,"The Marker is a true 5 Star hotel in terms of service, style and room quality. It is in a great location close to the Point/O2/3 Arena and the Bord Gais Energy Theatre. Realistically, a 5 minute taxi ride to Grafton St etc. 
It has a relaxed but still really polished approach to everything that we experienced, from the valet parking to check-in/out and handling of taxi bookings. Breakfast is very good but they approach the hot food delivery with buffet-style which is almost impossible to get 100% as your scrambled eggs will always be sitting there for a while:) You can order off menu but there is a supplement for that (a bit cheeky that). The room was fitted out impeccably with lovely shower, toiletries, complementary water etc that you would expect but don't always get at some 5 Stars.
Would stay here every time gladly.",5,2014,11,17
206,Super hotel,"Stayed just one night for rugby at Aviva- this is an up scale hotel - rooms first class (beds a little firm for us), reception and service very high standard,- didn't eat in hotel but quite a few eateries nearby. Valet car parking 20euro per day. It's not a bad location but prefer something bit more central. Overall it would be difficult to find fault here.",4,2014,11,17
206,Great Hotel,"Four of us have just returned from a great weekend in Dublin, and i have to say staying at The Marker was the icing on the cake, what a great Hotel, all the staff were friendly and very professional from the moment we walked in to checking out.
The rooms were very clean and comfortable with a lovely large bathroom and a very comfortable bed. The rooms were kept immaculately clean by housekeeping and the turn down service was a nice touch.
Breakfast was amazing and well worth the money, booking the day before also saved money.
We tried the Spa which was good, although we didn't try any of the treatments.
Another great thing about The Marker is the rooftop bar, we had some great cocktails and although it was October the heaters and blankets kept us warm (well that and the cocktails i guess!)
All in all a great Hotel that i would highly recommend, a little out of the centre but the cab drivers are really good, you also get a lot of good advice from them.",5,2014,11,16
206,Amazing hotel,"Fantastic hotel with the most friendliest and professional staff I have ever come across in a hotel environment. The little touches like a birthday cupcake set out , the slippers left by the bed and the chocolates on your pillow. I could go on and on about this hotel as it was the best I have ever stayed in and will definitely be back.. Could not recommend it enough. Thank you for a fabulous stay.",5,2014,11,15
206,Go to relaxing stay in Dublin,"I travel to Dublin about 6-8 times a year, and The Marker has become my favourite retreat. In summer if the weather is good, go up to the roof bar for a great vibe. If it's a bit cooler they provide blankets. Some have complained that this is a bit away from the city centre (‚Ç¨10 in a cab, walkable if you don't have luggage). I actually like that about it - it's nice to get away from the hubbub of the middle of town.",4,2014,11,13
206,Rooftop bar is the jewel in this hotels crown!,"A bit late with this review!  Stayed in this hotel in April with a friend for 1 night.  Room was fab very large with great view of the docklands.  Bathroom spotless with lots of towels.  Are deal didn't include breakfast but we found plenty of nice restaurants/coffee shops close by. We never got to experience the pool or spa Which is a pity as it sounds wonderful- definitely on the list for the next stay! We also decided to eat our main evening meal elsewhere as the restaurant in the hotel is very open plan and in my opinion lacks atmosphere, more like a canteen feel from it. The huge bonus to this hotel is the rooftop bar,  which if you're lucky and the weather is good is a definite must!  Fantastic view of Dublin with a decent food menu and the bottle of house white is divine!   Staff up there are so friendly and attentive offering blankets if it's a bit chilly and never far if you need a top up from the bar!  Can't wait to return! ",4,2014,11,12
206,Close to heaven`,"This hotel is stunningly modern and yet hasn't abandoned any of the comfort, or most desirable features one might find in a more traditional or, old fashioned hotel, giving rise to it's quaint and sophisticated atmosphere. Don't let my use of the word quaint deceive your perception though, as this hotel is a beacon of white, modern magnificence.I first experienced this when I walked in the front entrance to the lobby, then again on the roof! It was a cold autumn day, one recently enough and the skies were full of thick white clouds, but I still felt as though I was somewhere like New York or LA, as the roof top bar and terrace was out-of-this-world classy, really putting the icing on the cake for my visit to the Marker (Even though I didn't stay their this time round in Dublin) I had a glass eh hem (bottle) of bubbly and salmon Ceviche  (incorrect spelling) and thoroughly reveled in the views of Dublin from the roof top bar:  it was a close to heaven experience.",5,2014,11,12
206,Top notch 5 stars hotel!,"Everything you get from this hotel is amazing. It is located at about 20 min walk from temple bar area, right in the center of the Dublin's financial district. 

The roof top bar and other facilities are very well maintained and nice. The staffs are very friendly and would go the extra mile to help you. They come and tidy up your room twice a day. 

I can go on and on about this hotel. It is definitely worth the extra money you pay for Marker. 

Well done and I look forward to my next stay!

206,Wonderful place to stay,"We stayed for a few days at the Marker Hotel in September and enjoyed every minute while we were at this hotel.  Their staff is excellent, very helpful and always pleasant.  The rooms and bathroom were very large and the beds we extremely comfortable.  We ate at the breakfast in the morning and it is well worth the price.  Everything was so fresh and delicious plus there were so many options available which was much appreciated.  We also enjoyed using their swimming pool and gym during our stay since a lot of hotels do not have them.",5,2014,11,11
206,Amazing pool,"The Marker....lavish surroundings...but I didn't feel it was relaxing. Too much going on. Rooftop pool closed. Rooms very spacious.  The pool are was the best I have ever seen, the lighting, the temperature, wish I'd had time for a visit the next day again! The directions on the website weren't accurate...",4,2014,11,10
206,outstanding experience in dublin,"Spent a weekend in Dublin - my wife's birthday and university visit combined. We chose the Marker having read many good reviews and it proved to be an excellent choice. The hotel is nearly new, very stylish and cool. Great location, a little bit of a walk from the City Centre but good spot in its own right on the Grand Canal basin. Lots of good bars and restaurants nearby.
The best thing about the Marker however is its staff. From reception through the restaurant to the room attendants, everyone was smiling, helpful and efficient. They are a real credit to the Hotel and helped make our stay a memorable one. Oh and the food is pretty good too - don't miss Le Drunch,  great way to pass a Sunday afternoon",5,2014,11,10
206,Everything we expected !,"Fantastic 2 night stay at the marker. All staff members we encountered were extremely friendly and seemed genuinely interested in what we had planned for our weekend away. Room was very spacious and comfortable - would have loved a room with a view of the water but maybe next time ! The bathroom was huge and towels replaced each day. Strawberrys, chocolate dessert and a very nice note was left in the room from the manager wishing me a Happy Birthday, which I really enjoyed. The rooftop bar is a must, was too cold to sit outdoors so we were seated in the covered area but didn't take away from the feel out it. Lovely cocktail called ""Touch of Frost"" ‚Ç¨13.50 - was delicious. Great location to the city centre and an umbrella was offered to me as the weather was a bit wet ! 

The swimming pool was one I will remember - The black tile around the pool area is beautiful. Lovely Sauna, steam room and Jacuzzi . Not busy at all. Very peaceful and a lovely place to relax. Had a beer in the bar downstairs and prices were very reasonable. Didn't eat in the hotel so cannot comment on the food. 

Would definitely return !",5,2014,11,10
206,Really enjoyable,"Had a enjoyable stay at the Marker over the weekend. Staff were friendly, rooms were comfortable, breakfast had a good selection, check out was a bit slow, but everyone was checking out at the same time. Will return.",4,2014,11,09
206,Marvellous Marker is making it's mark!,"The Marker is a five star hotel in Dublin's docklands area. The staff are very friendly and obliging. The decor and furnishing are excellent. Our room was beautiful...large, comfy bed, big floor to ceiling window, chic ensuite. There is a nightly turn down service complete with chocolates.
The hotel has an amazing rooftop bars that affords wonderful views of the city at night. Superb with great food. The Marker is close to a stop for the City Hop on Hop off bus. It is also only a short walk away from a stop for the airport shuttle. These buses come very frequently and are punctual. 
Another short walk from the hotel..literally only minutes, you will find the graffiti walls for U2.. Very interesting. There are good convenience  shops very close by. We were treated very well at the Marker. Great stay. Highly recommend to visitors to Dublin. The Concierge wears a top hat. TOPS!",5,2014,11,07
206,"Fab Stay, Loved The Marker","I booked this hotel as a treat for myself and my cousin for a big girls night out on Saturday...and a treat it was! Arriving at the hotel, we saw the beautiful lobby and loved it, we checked in half an hour early and when we got up to the room we were greeted with a super spacious, plush, clean, modern, trendy room with everything we could have needed including two amazingly comfy queen beds! Although the fixtures and fittings of this hotel are fab, we found that it was the staff who make this hotel, they are great and you could have a real laugh with them- especially the concierge, the security and a lovely guy in the brasserie..they were all polite and courteous as you would expect but they seemed genuinely interested in helping and speaking to us which is lovely. We felt like celebs haha!! 
The rooftop bar is just brill we loved the fact that they had heaters and blankets too!! It's not even any more expensive than anywhere else that we went so its well worth having a few at the hotel with the views. 
The spa was gorgeous, as a spa therapist myself I can sometimes find pools/jacuzzi's a bit of a 'busmans holiday' however, this is something else, its stunning and we were SO chilled out in there. The Jacuzzi was like a hot bath and the infinity pool looked like glass. The best spa experience I've had in Europe. We both agreed it was the perfect hangover cure along with the cronuts!! 
We had room service whilst we were getting ready to go out on sat night (pizza and chips very sophisticated haa) the pizza was lovely but we were both hoping for home made chips and they were more like 'school chips', that's the only criticism really..they weren't great at all, but we still ate them like! 
We were asked numerous times if it was worth getting flights over to Ireland and staying in a luxury hotel just for the sake of one night out, and we both agreed YES, DEFINITELY! We've both said we're going to do the same thing next year. Keep up the good work :)",5,2014,11,06
206,Good hotel.  Minor things kept is from being great.,"Overall, I was very happy with my stay at the Marker, however, a few things could've made it much better.  The room was nice and the bathroom was large.  The staff was great.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze.  Unfortunately, there was an issue with the taxi the hotel booked for me.  It was not available at the expected time and the hotel promised a flat negotiated rate to the airport, which I did not receive.  Additionally, the hotel restaurant and rooftop bar were both closed during my visit (and that was one of the major selling points of this hotel and a reason I booked it).  The walk to city centre/Temple Bar wasn't bad, but I don't know that I'd stay in the docklands area again unless I had a reason to be there.  I can certainly recommend the hotel, but it wasn't perfect.",4,2014,11,05
206,Cheerful Marker,"Well trained attentive and polite staff. Breakfast very good and the burger at lunchtime is superb.
Would recommend the nearby Ferryman bar for a late drink. Easy access to town by taxis 10 mins. x20mins walk. Special mention for Eleena at Breakfast who referred to me as ""Her Lovely Customer"" She was brill !
Hotel gave us a free upgrade considering it was a special birthday celebration",4,2014,11,05
206,Four nights in Dublin,"Excellent staff, superb rooms. Breakfast  was OK , but spoilt by cold plates on the hot buffet. . Our suite had excellent views of the conference centre which was beautifully illuminated at night. Must visit a local punb called The Ferryman , excellent Guinness with a vibrant friendly clientele",4,2014,11,04
206,Small things can detract!!,"As mentioned by many people the hotel is great albeit Dublin taxis have a sliding scale on charging having paid from 6 Euros to 16 Euros for the same journey to Temple Bar.

Constructive criticism
Breakfast service on our first day was poor and even the restaurant manager agreed that it had not been up to their standards. So why did I have to ask for it to be credited rather than being offered!

If there is a time for children in the pool please stick to it and also dont allow babies into the pool without nappies

The jacuzzi was fabulous pity that I watched 4 different people trying to get into it on the wrong side of the handrail and one went full length! Perhaps an arrow to show where the stars are would be good

Also couldnt understand why the rooftop bar didnt open till 3pm at weekends

Difficult to get curtain fully shut so consequently the lights from outside kept the room partly lit

Otherwise a super hotel with lovely staff and rooms. May need to return to see the rooftop bar!",4,2014,11,03
206,The friendliest staff ever...,"This is the perfect 5star hotel! Wonderful rooms and the beds are divine! The bathroom is super spacious, well lit and got floor heating, that you can adjust. It is o-so-quiet at night, I had a wonderful sleep!
The breakfast staff is truly amazing: super accomodating, helpful, friendly and happy! Fantastic experience!
The staff everywhere is well trained and very very polite. My room service lady was the best appearence ever! Super helpful, efficient and just nice... 
Highly recommended as a modern experience in a interesting neighbourhood. You will not regret!",5,2014,11,02
206,Stunning hotel,"What a perfect 2 night stay we had at the marker. From arriving to checking out it was just perfect. We had a room on the second floor and the room was a very decent size, very clean infact absolutely spotless. The bathroom was very big too with a bath & a shower. I liked the touch of having underfloor heating, it was much apprecited with winter approching. There is tea & coffee making facilities in the room and my other half was delighted at being able to make fresh coffee with complimentary biscuits. The bed was too comfortable and I made use of the services of being able to order different types of pillows to your desire. We made use of the spa facilities and the pool was a good size & very relaxing. Plenty of seating around the pool area to enable relaxation amidst the business of being in Dublin city. My partner noticed that the hotel offers a curtesy car from the hotel to any destination within a reasonable radius. This was a bonus as we made use of this service. I cannot fault this hotel. It really is 5* service. I will be back very soon. Thank you for a memorable stay",5,2014,11,01
206,Amazing hotel in perfect location for visiting Dublin,"I've stayed in a number of top notch hotels all over the world and this one is up there! The service even prior to checking in is unbeatable. Upon check in our two kids were asked to fill in there own check in card which included there favorite drink - within 10 minutes of being in the room this was brought up! 

I'm writing this from the hotel, lay in my comfy bed.

Every member of staff I saw and dealt with in the hotel was perfect - couldn't do enough, always smiling, always had a 'hello' or 'goodnight' and always had the time to be making sure every aspect of the hotel was perfect for its guests. 

The rooms are a good size and look virtually brand new with quality finish throughout.

The location is unbeatable for us as last night we went to see Shrek at the Bord Gais Energy Theater (amazing show, don't be put off thinking its Shrek and it will be no good - been to a number of NYC Broadway shows and this was up there with them - anyway I digress) - the theater is literally opposite the entrance to the hotel - 30 meters I reckon for the reader who needs figures.

I would not hesitate to stay again and recommend this 100%

One of the best!",5,2014,11,01
206,Great Hotel...housekeeping not so much,"Spent two nights as walk-ins since due to last minute change of plans. The hotel is really cool, the staff was so helpful and nice; the room was very nice and we loved the heated bathroom floors. My husband tried to use the pool facilities but he was too late which was disappointing because it looks incredible in pictures. The restaurant manager was really sweet to let me have breakfast even though they'd closed 15 mins earlier, which I'd mistakenly thought was 10:30am. Anyway, everything was terrific except housekeeping. Our towels 2 bath, 2 face and 2 hand towels were all dirty so we put them on the floor to be replaced with fresh ones. When we came in that night, we found they'd been all been folded and placed back on sink. Gross. ",4,2014,11,01
206,Top notch,"This hotel has the best service I have ever experienced and a lot of care to minimum details. The restaurant and bar were extremely good with very tasty food and drinks. Breakfast is delightful, you can easily spend an hour trying and enjoying all the dishes. WiFi is flawless and the location is beautiful. The rooms are pretty, spacious and comfortable at the same time as being practical with the facilities.",5,2014,10,30
206,Girls night out,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. From the welcome at reception, to the super king size bed, to the tapas on the rooftop terrace, to atmosphere in lobby bar, luxurious carpets,  trendy decor and super location. I love this hotel and it is one of the few I would say I am definitely going to try get back to with my hubbie!  I highly recommend.  Staff are all superb and so naturally friendly. Love love love it!! ",5,2014,10,29
206,Great place without the snobbery,"Hi my wife and two very young children stayed for two nights.The staff were very friendly and made an effort every time I met them to have a chat.We had a superior room on 3rd floor overlooking the water.It was an amazing room with shower and bath and an amazing view and funky lights lighted up the outside areas.The area is very safe with a few food and restaurants. We tried 'milano' which did Italian food ~recommmended.We ate in the hotel bar.The service was a bit on the slow side but the food very good.The prices were what you expect at this grade of hotel.There was also an amazing swimming pool,sauna and jazzuci.
.In terms of prices the hotel reservations matched the cheapest online price I found.Overall a great experience which other hotels should take note to follow.I will return next year.
",5,2014,10,29
206,impeccable,"The rooms are amazing, the amenities even better.  Eco-friendly, high class and delicious food in the bar area. In a safe part of town, with fun bars near-by. The staff were so friendly and helpful with airport/train transportation as well as with giving directions and suggestions!  Could not be happier!",5,2014,10,29
206,Amazing!,"We were very pleased with our stay at The Market Hotel October 2014.  The hotel accommodations were great - very clean and super modern.  The staff was the most friendliest and helpful I have ever experienced.  A special thanks goes out to Barry the doorman who found the Civil Registration Service place my mother was looking for (which was MUCH closer than what we were originally planning to go to), and Kapil the waiter who worked during breakfast and made our time very enjoyable, especially while I was juggling two jet lagged young children while my husband was at work.  The staff always greeted you upon arrival with a smile and asked if there was anything they could assist with.  We stayed in a corner room suite with a sofa bed (which the staff came promptly to turn down and setup).  Everyone there was attentive to every little detail, the doorman would even step in if there happened to be a long line for the front desk - Gabriel had stepped in when he noticed I was waiting on line and offered his assistance!  Would recommend this hotel to anyone who is staying in Dublin!!!",5,2014,10,29
206,Fabulous,The hotel and staff were excellent. Lovely room with everything we needed. All the staff were very helpful and friendly and nothing was a problem to them. Food was gorgeous and the rooftop bar was amazing. ,5,2014,10,27
206,"Fantastic, Luxurious Hotel!","What a gorgeous hotel The Marker is! When we arrived our room wasn't ready (we didn't expect it to be as it was 9.30am) however the receptionist took our number and contacted us as soon as our room was available. Throughout our stay all members of staff were extremely welcoming and helpful, the room itself was perfect, the bed was huge, the amenities were plentiful; iron, ironing board, hairdryer, choice of various tea's and coffee's, cafetiere, safe etc. The bathroom was amazing with both a deep bath, and a huge shower! I would not hesitate to re-visit this hotel, and would not choose to stay anywhere else whilst visiting Dublin.",5,2014,10,27
206,Wonderful experience.,"Booked the Marker for the bank holiday weekend as a family break for my wife and our two children who are under 8. From the moment we pulled up in the set down area on Saturday until we got into our car this morning the entire experience was simply top class. The check in was very smooth and as with some other hotels they had separate registration sheets for the kids, but unlike others they asked for the children's favourite drinks and delivered same to our room just after we had settled in, a lovely gesture. We had interconnecting rooms on the 6th floor which had lovely views. The very modern design and spacious layout of the rooms is very impressive. We ate in the hotel bar area on both evening's and found the service and food to be first class. The children's menu doubles as a very clever little entertainment pack with quizzes, puzzles and crayons. Our waiter on both evenings was Dev who went out of his way to make our children feel welcome.
We enjoyed a matinee show in the theatre across the street and afterwards visited the roof top terrace bar for some fruit cocktails (non alcoholic), it was a lovely experience and the source of some great pictures. As per a number of other reviews the breakfast was superb, excellent variety and very attentive service. The staff in this hotel are the best I've ever encountered!!. 

The only minor issue I would have is that the usage periods for children in the swimming pool is quite restrictive.  I'm sure our children are no different to others of a similar age, up at the crack of dawn and asking to go to the pool and 10am is quite a wait. I fully appreciate why there are designated times but would suggest that rather than 10am to 12pm perhaps 8am to 10am would be more beneficial as it allows for pool before breakfast and then families can get away for the day. It's the only thing that I would change and in truth I don't think it would stop us staying again. ",5,2014,10,27
206,"Great, perfect, cant say much more than that!","I stayed for a long weekend with 5 friends.... and it was a great stay with great service, not one issue. The hotel is in a newly developed aream, about 5 minutes by taxi from the main town and taxis are readily available outside or you can walk. There are also some local bars and restaurants to. Check-in was quick and easy, very polite and professional. The checkin are is at the front of house, to the left is the restuarant and to the right is the bar area followed by lifts to the roof top bar. I should imagine on a nice summers day the roof top would be great, but there is only a small seating area indoors and outdoors, some cover and heating with blankets but not much, but they are still very accomodating. Breakfast was a great spread, food was excellent, fruit, cereal, cooked and the staff were so polite and friendly and didnt stop. Our room was a suite, charged at a decent rate, free wifi, slippers, robes, loads of toileteries, tea, coffee, water etc etc. rooms were clean and tidy, turn down service, choccies, nothing was a problem for the staff. Bathroom was large, walkin shower etc etc. Flat screen TV although couldnt get the iphone facility working. We used the pool, nicely heated, good for a few lengths, sauna, etc etc Overall a very nice stay, would happily go back again and again.",5,2014,10,27
206,Lovely Hotel,"Just spent the weekend at the Marker Hotel in Dublin with my wife. The place is excellent. Helpful staff, lovely room, the spa was brilliant and the rooftop bar was the icing on the cake.

A little bit of a walk into town but really not that far.

I'd rather be there now than sat in my office writing a review!",5,2014,10,27
206,Treated like royalty,"We left the hotel this morning and were very sorry to leave. We stayed two nights for my wife's 40th Birthday, and we were so impressed. Fantastic welcome and we were very lucky and privileged to have a free upgrade to a Luxury corner suite. The room was HUGE, the views were fantastic, the room was immaculately clean and ultra modern. The staff at reception were warm and friendly the whole time through, the gentlemen working at the front door couldn't have been more helpful. I have traveled a lot through work and social means and i have stayed in 5 Star hotels but i honestly think this is the best hotel i have ever stayed at. We went up for a drink to the rooftop hotel and the views are spectacular, there is also a fantastic food store opposite the hotel and the whole area around the hotel is very nice and ultra modern, I can't thank the hotel enough for how special they made my wife's birthday and if we come back to Dublin then there is nowhere else that we would stay.",5,2014,10,25
206,Excellent hotel and fabulous service,I have recently been at a summit in Dublin which ran for four days. I was fortunate to be accommodated at The Marker Hotel. From the moment I arrived and was greeted by the hyper efficient doorman (Barry) to being assisted by the General Manager (Charlie Sheil) on what would have for most people have been accomplishing an impossible request every part of the stay was excellent. The rooms are well appointed and spotlessly clean. The restaurant and bar service is faultless. I would have no hesitation to recommend this hotel and will definitely return again,4,2014,10,24
206,A modern classic,"My wife and I visited the Rooftop bar on Saturday October 18. Access is restricted for safety purposes. The official monitoring the numbers before allowing access to the lift was pleasant and helpful. On reaching the roof we were wowed by the view. The manager of the bar offered to seat us. It was clear that many visitors come purely to sample the view and are readily facilitated. We ordered drinks and shared a ""slider"" dish. It comprised 2 small burgers served with unusual butternut chips/crisps on the side. The food was no more than a snack but well presented and tasty. We were surprised no soup or chowder was on offer. There were a large number of staff who were well presented and efficient. We enjoyed observing our fellow posers. The cost for 1 glass of Pignot Grigio,1 bottle of craft red ale and the food came to ‚Ç¨28 approx. Definitely worth a visit as a treat or for a special occasion (weather permitting).",5,2014,10,21
206,Nice hotel stay......would visit again.,"Lovely hotel, a little out the way from the town centre, there is a hop on bus nearby (docklands tour) which can get you to town.  Breakfast was help yourself, wasn't the best if i am honest.  The pool is nice, steam room sauna and jacuzzi all used and nice to relax after a hard days walking. The skybar is a must do, although when we visited it was a little cold but they do provide blankets, The service at the bar was good.  My wife lost her phone at the airport and the help we recieved from the reception desk was incredible and so lovely we eventually got the phone back within an hour, Thank you! Will be visiting again.",5,2014,10,21
206,"Ultra-modern, awesome design and extraordinary service-level","The Marker is located in a hot, new neighborhood in Dublin, and the building is a great example of modern architecture - in its imposing, twisted geometrical angles. I was already impressed when I entered, but that was only the beginning!
The reception was busy when I arrived, and I stood and waiting for my turn. While I was waiting, an attentive member of staff offered me a glass of citrus-infused water, which immediately took the edge of my wait. When the reception was ready to receive me, I was greeted by a smiling staff member, who could not immediately allocate me a room (according to the specifications I asked for), and instead offered me a complimentary drink in the bar and a news paper. I happily sat down and waited for 30 minutes in the stylish bar, after which a staff member came to me an gave me the keys for my room. I immediately realised that the Marker has great staff with a real problem-solver attitude. 

I made my way to my room, which was very cool, yet lush and had everything I needed - a bathtub (and shower), working space, huge comfortable bed and a great high-quality supply of bathroom essentials (the hand soap is so deliciously fragrant!). One thing I really found a great touch was the French-press for making coffee in my room.

The bar and lounge in the lobby was always busy, which people dressed for special occassions, making it a lively space, and the service was impeccable. The roof-top terrace bar, is small, gorgeous, with well-selected music. And the staff there were also great. 

Breakfast was a delight, with very strong service personnel. We had not booked breakfast in advance, but we couldn't resist once we saw it. The reception was ever helpful throughout our stay, and one staff member went to great length to help us find suitable restaurants and succeeded at giving us a fantastic taste of Dublin. 

Overall, this is a top-notch hotel, with outstanding staff - the like of whom is rarely seen at hotels in this price-range in Europe. I really cannot compliment the staff enough: They were courteous, elegant and above-all very, very good at their jobs. The Marker's staff are an example to be followed. 

Myself and my better half summarised our stay at the Marker like this: ""We'd go back to Dublin just to stay at the Marker again"". It's rare that we don't miss our apartment when we stay in hotels, but, for a moment at the Marker, we didn't.",5,2014,10,21
206,Incredible customer service,"Absolutely loved our one night stay for my birthday and a show at the theatre next door.From the moment we arrived we were fussed over and treated like royalty,I have never encountered such amazing customer service,every staff member was so friendly,as a treat for my birthday I was given a lovely cupcake in my room and a glass of champagne with Sunday lunch,lovely touch.Food was delicious, loved the homemade bread served in little hessian sacks,so much to like about this hotel,rooftop bar was fab ardour room on 4th floor had amazing view over grand canal...We will be back.",5,2014,10,20
206,"Awesome time here, but I'm not happy at all","I had a wonderfull 2 night stay in Dublin at The Marker Hotel.
Awesome location, service, facilities and everything was good.
After I checked out however, I have been severely inconvenienced due to my room deposit still not being returned to me after 19 days!
I feel completely let down and after such a great stay this really has left a terrible taste in my mouth.
After almost 3 weeks I certainly feel that this mess could have been avoided.",5,2014,10,20
206,Love this hotel 5*plus,"Stunning hotel , rooms , service ,staff amazing . The room was constantly cleaned and condiments replenished twice a day. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin , totally spoiled rotten with this hotel. Roof top terrace brilliant. Took my fianc√© for his 30th birthday and definitely was not disappointed . Can't wait to visit dublin again and stay in this hotel. Despite the fact it was approx 20 min walk into temple bar this still doesn't put me off. Wish we would have known there was a green hop on hop off bus stop around the corner ! Will know for next time :)",5,2014,10,19
206,Great stay good service and lovely hotel. Will be back.,The staff are friendly and helpful. This is how all hotels should operate. I recommend that you book the restaurant and roof top bar. Cocktail choice is great and you can't beat experienced bar staff. Great location for the theatre.,5,2014,10,19
206,Outstanding Service,"We stayed three nights at the Marker from 1 to 4 October. The hotel room was very comfortable and well equipped and the roof-top bar a treat. We dined once at the brasserie where the food and wine were excellent but what really made the stay memorable were the outstanding staff. Everyone we encountered was friendly and efficient and went out of their way to be helpful; in particular our waiter Marcos, on his first dinner service, was superb.",5,2014,10,18
206,Fabulous hotel,"Bedrooms, service, food and rooftop bar all fantastic! Worth a stay if you can get a room! Best check in ever!  The staff make the place and the design of the hotel is very unique. Also overlooks a beautiful river and has the forest sculpture right outside.",5,2014,10,16
206,Five star all the way,we have used this hotel over the last year for overnights and it has always risen to the highest standards. This time we met some friends in the bar for an early evening quick bite. Service exemplary and food totally pleasing to all. One of our party had not seen Dublin from the top floor bar but although on this evening it was closed the manager insisted on opening the upstairs area and giving us a private visit. Five stars are ingrained in this hotel.,5,2014,10,15
206,Very nice hotel,"Scheduled for another hospital appointment in Crumlin Children's Hospital for our little boy, we decided to stay in the Marker Hotel due to its location in the city centre.

We had heard good things about the hotel and from reading the reviews we thought it was a great choice. We're very thankful to the hotel for the wonderful rate that was provided to us for the night of our stay.

On approach to the hotel we were met by security / porter (as our arrival was late) who kindly unloaded the car and helped us into the hotel as with two children under 2, we don't travel light.

We were taken to the lobby where check in was fast and efficient, all staff we met at this stage were extremely friendly and no task was too small for them. The porter then advised he was going to park our car, and took the car to the car park (please note, there is a ‚Ç¨20 charge for the valet car parking, but this is very reasonable for the city centre.)

We decided to upgrade to a suite (which cost an extra ‚Ç¨30) just to have a little extra room so our 1.5 year old could move around without worrying. 

Overall, so far very impressed with the hotel and the service. Its living up to its expectations in terms of the service of the staff - however we felt a little let down by the room.

The porter guided us around the room, advised of all the amenities and even ordered a coffee to be brought to the room for us.

The room we felt wasn't very spacious compared to a standard room, the only addition we felt was the addition of a couch (which was placed under the TV, so it was impossible to sit and relax) but with two babies, there wasn't much relaxing to be done. The room amenities we're fantastic however, fresh brewed coffee (first time I've seen fresh cafetiere coffee in a hotel room) and a secure wifi connection only for the room - this is a fantastic service.

The breakfast was amazing, lots to choose from in buffet style. We did feel a little underdressed (even at breakfast) due to the fact it was 90% businessmen in suits having breakfast, we were dressed casually in T-shirts and jeans.

Checkout again was very fast with no issues. The porter on duty, came to our room and took our bags. The car was already waiting outside for us, and the porter had our bags tidely packed into the boot of the car for our arrival. He couldn't master the pram, however I don't blame him as I still cannot fold it without a struggle myself! Two bottles of still water placed in the car for us was a nice little touch.

Overall, very satisfied with our stay and we cannot fault the staff in any way. It was 5***** service received at all times, and again no task was too small for the staff!",4,2014,10,15
206,5 star experience,"The attention to small details makes the Marker a truly 5 star experience. Without exception every member of staff we met was friendly and welcoming, helpful and courteous. Stephan in particular impressed us. Sitting at the rooftop top on a sunny Saturday afternoon it felt like we were somewhere much more exotic than Dublin and the spa is also a rare find in a city centre location. We will definitely be back and I would recommend it without hesitation.",5,2014,10,14
206,Those Drinks!,"We didn`t stay at the hotel , but visited the rooftop bar for pre dinner drinks. They were amazing! And the view was great. And the service was nice, all though a little slow, but worth it because the drinks!!!  Try the specials!",4,2014,10,14
206,Stylish and comfortable,"The hotel faces the Grand Canal place and the Bord Gais Energy Theatre. The view on the place side is stunning. Great neighbourhood to have a drink or eat something. The hotel itself if stylish, extremely well furnished, and comfortable the staff both friendly and professional. The swimming pool is my favorite hotel pool ever.",5,2014,10,13
206,Wonderful stay,"I rareldy write a review but the hospitality, service, and attentativeness of the staff and hotel managers was so outstanding. This hotel is truly 5 star. It is modern and well located The breakfast buffet was excellent and the breakfast staff was always very attentive and provided great service Our tours started early so we could not wait for the breakfast buffet but the manager arranged for us to have room service early in the morning All the staff were extremely cordial and helpful from the doorman to the maid service to the reservation desk and of course the managers - John B",5,2014,10,13
206,Just great,"From the moment of arrival to that of departure, simply a transport of delight. Great location for Dublin Convention Centre, 3 Arena, an Bord Gais theatre. Every member of staff was friendly and helpful without that intrusiveness and obsequiousness sometimes encountered.
The rooms were quiet,bright,airy,spacious and clean
Breakfast was a delight with lovely food nicely presented and a daily newspaper..
The Poland sauna were equally lovely, except for some Whitney lady remonstrating with her husband in the steam room with no concern for others.
The internet was a couple of clicks on first use only and was free and uniform quality throughout the hotel......just the way it should be.
The only downside was some food smells from the restaurant which tended to permeate, but I would have no qualms in recommending this hotel to anyone.",5,2014,10,13
206,what a surprise,"well as we were going to Ireland and staying at different hotels we choose this one we weren't sure as it is a new modern hotel not normally one we would go to , we need not have worried the staff from the rec to the dining room was lovely we booked the pre theatre dinner what good food and the breakfast was so good and the manager helps out they were very busy but all got very good service I hope they keep this up and we will go back absolutely 
thank you all so much",5,2014,10,13
206,A brand new hotel with spacious rooms and big bathrooms,"I stayed there already twice, so:
it is a brand new hotel with spacious rooms, big bathrooms, nice views on the square and harbour, perfect location (if you are up for business for nearby located companies);
swimming pool area is rather strange (with the black pool), frankly it is uncomfortable to swim (but perhaps it is a matter of taste).",5,2014,10,12
206,Very nice hotel,"My wife and I stayed at The Marker for a week end trip away.

Very impressed with the complete package from check in to departure.

The check in was quick and uncomplicated, the room was lovely, clean tidy and very modern.

The bathroom was superb, lovely stone set rooms, just perfect.

The hotel is located in the old docklands area and is nicely situated in an area that has undergone major investment to make it very nice, it is just a short walk away from the main centre of Dublin, but far enough away to be peaceful.

The food was very good, good selection of main meals, wines and a very big choice at breakfast utilising good quality ingredients.

Really impressed with this hotel and staff were very polite.

The roof top bar is amazing, but does get very busy, so in busy times you must put your name down and wait your turn, make sure you go up there though for an amazing view and ambience.

Thanks to all concerned for a lovely stay.",5,2014,10,11
206,Just lovely,"We stayed in The Marker for 1 night recently. We were going to the 3Arena and decided that the location was perfect for us. The 3Arena is only about a 10 minute walk away and the city centre is very close by too.
The rooms are beautifully decorated, very spacious and extremely comfortable
The staff are lovely, they are very friendly and attentive. 
As it was our anniversary, we were gifted with a lovely bottle of wine in our room when we returned later in the evening accompanied with a very thoughtful card.
We were there the same day as some big conference and seating in the bar that evening was very limited but the staff hurried around to ensure that extra tables and chairs were brought out so nobody was left standing for too long.
My only quibble was that we didn't get to use the Rooftop bar as it was too full, I know this may seem trivial but the Rooftop bar was full from the conference attendees and we as paying hotel guests were not permitted to go in due to space issues. Again a trivial matter that was only exacerbated by the bad weather.   
Overall, a very pleasurable stay, I would highly recommend and will stay again myself in the future. ",4,2014,10,10
206,New LHW in Dublin,"I am a big fan of hotel brand Leading Hotels of World (LHW) due to their high quality in hotel preferences and standards and The Marker Hotel Dublin stood strong against the demanding criteria. 

The hotel is located a good 20 minutes‚Äô walk (or 5 minutes taxi depending on heavy Dublin traffic) from the city centre in the new financial district of the city where the business buildings have been developed but not so much the shopping and dinning aspect. This was my only dissapointment.   

My stay included three rooms for a party of 6 six. Our rooms where large, carpeted, comfortable, and spotlessly clean. The bathroom did not have a separate toilet but we enjoyed the rain shower and the luxury toiletries and not forgetting the fluffy towels and bathrobes.

The rooms included a well appointed tea and coffee making facilities, ironing facilities and a well stocked mini bar. The room Service was carried out to a high Standard and the Food did taste very delicious and the Price was not astronomical.

For my the highlight was the swimming pool, the sauna, the whirlpool‚Ä¶opened from 6:30am this was just perfect!

I do not know what the hotel does to it staff: either very good lighting or a moisturiser but they all just seem to glow with interest and enthusiasm! 

Will return and would highly recommend to a guest not looking to stay right in the middle of the City centre.",5,2014,10,10
206,Nice hotel to stay in,"Overall I was impressed with the hotel, the staff were nice and the roof bar is a nice place to have a drink. The hotel is pricey as it is a 5 star but we had little choice as Dublin was very busy that weekend. It wasn't much dearer than 3 stars in the city so we treated ourselves. The bed was a nice big double bed and not just two single beds pushed together. A good quality bed is a must for a good review.",4,2014,10,09
206,This Hotel has the Wow factor,"A most impressive hotel from the foyer, friendly and attentive staff to the spacious bedroom and underfloor heating in the plush bathroom.  Took my partner away for a birthday treat and had an amazing few days.  Only 10-15 min walk into the city centre and situated next to bars, cafe's and beautiful theatre. This Hotel is really worth a visit",5,2014,10,09
206,Great stay,"Stayed only for one night.  Arrived at the hotel at 8am after an early flight, hoping to be able to change and store our bags.  Instead they gave us our room early!  Quiet, very comfortable bed, modern and large room.  Rooftop bar was too busy but we had a look anyway.  Really enjoyed the pool, steam room and hot tub.  One of my favorites!!",5,2014,10,09
206,Beautiful space in excellant location,"I held a one day business event at this hotel and was very impressed. The Location in the newly regenerated Docklands is lovely, giving a feeling of peace and tranquility while still being within walking distance of the City Center. Meeting facilities were very good and the staff very helpful. Accommodation was excellent with bright clean spacious rooms. My next trip to Dublin I would certainly look to stay here again.",4,2014,10,09
206,fabulous hotel,"Stayed here for three great nights and didn't want to leave! This hotel has size and style - the rooms are big and the bathrooms impressive. New large flat screens connect you to all the information and WiFi. Daily chocolates and turn down service much appreciated as well! If you have time - check out the pool/spa area. 25m infinity pool is perfect for a swim, plus the steam/sauna/jacuzzi and mood lighting help you relax. Finally, the rooftop bar has to be checked out - don't be put off if the door staff tell you it is too busy I think they want to maintain the ""exclusive"" vibe, plus they won't refuse hotel guests.",5,2014,10,08
206,Shocking,"So disappointed... Spent a fortune on a 4 day stay in a suite and was treated like a 2nd class citizen. Not a tabs welcome but robotic.. The reception grit was more interested in my credit card than smiling.. Room was nice but.. Hairs in bath, hair on pillow, really??? I went to the front desk and they said they could only downgrade me if I was to move but someone would contact me the following day.. That never happened... Rooftop amazing views but packed full to extract max revenue and loses all service! Dirty napkins and floor everywhere! Ignored for ages.. I have to stop now.. Getting annoyed.. Have a 2nd opportunity to a manage to assist with move but never came back to me.. Poor..",1,2014,10,07
206,They Put the AWE in AWESOME!,"WOW! What an amazing hotel. Its set in the newly renovated dockland area and a short 5-10 minute walk to the city center. The rooms couldn't be anymore spacious and the restroom was just as impressive. This hotel needs to become a chain so i can give them more of my money. Are they earth friendly? Yes! It is nice walk to and from the city center? Yes! Are the amenities offered good? No, they are GREAT! What about bars? Any good bars? Umm, rooftop bar is enough to make you want to wish you were in love to share it with that someone special. What about the staff, are they nice? Heck ya they are nice! I almost felt like I was staying a friends place. I would recommend this hotel to any and everyone!",5,2014,10,07
206,Superb Hotel,"We stayed at the Marker hotel for a couple of nights this August (2014) during our first visit to Dublin. I have to say it was close to perfect! The staff were attentive and friendly and the docklands location is great; only a 20 min walk to Temple Bar in the city.

The rooms are very modern; black granite bathrooms and plush bedrooms. Very comfy!",5,2014,10,07
206,First Class Hotel!,"Just back from an amazing night's stay in The Marker- what a fabulous hotel. The staff were so friendly and accomodating, even from the initial booking stage, where my every request was met with a prompt response. I am so impressed by the hotel and wish to thank the staff for making my stay just perfect! Stunning interiors and very funky and modern - a real gem. I will definately be making a return trip very soon.",5,2014,10,06
206,Lovely hotel,"Beautifully decorated hotel, the room was fantastic and the reception staff were incredibly welcoming and friendly, even using my name to say goodnight when I walked past later in the evening. Good location in Dublin. Bar menu was a little 'healthy' for me after arriving late at night on a business trip if I'm honest :0)",5,2014,10,06
206,Great Location,"Stayed in The Marker Hotel as a Birthday treat. Beautiful modern hotel, in a great location just beside Bord Gais Energy Theatre. The rooms were a good size and bed very comfortable. The breakfast was excellent one of the best I have had in a hotel.",5,2014,10,05
206,Very plush,My wife brought me here for my birthday and it was top class. Great style and valet parking put this above the other hotels I've stayed in while in town. It's pricy but the little things are worth it in my opinion like bathroom products and branded water in the room. A fully stocked mini bar available with is dear but that's to be expected. Visited the roof top bar which was full of groups having food and drink but a reservation is recommended as there is limited space. The only fault in this hotel is the poor athmosphere. The hotel was busy but we were whispering in the bar it was so quiet and sterile. Ended up going to a nearby bar for drinks and food because if this. Overall great hotel with a great location plenty to keep you happy. ,4,2014,10,05
206,Beautiful Luxury,"I would definitely stay at The Marker again.  The rooms were immaculate and spacious.  I wish I had more time to visit the spa but I did stop in to look and the pool is amazing.  There is a rooftop bar, but I was there for 2 nights and it was only open one of the nights.  I am not sure why it wasn't open every night and there was an event in the hotel so I am sure there would have been people there.  The hotel is located about a 15 minute walk from Grafton Street and Temple Bar.  I enjoyed being away from the noise and crowds, so this wasn't a bother to me.  The bus station is about a 5 minute walk and the Dublin hop on hop off bus stops around the corner.  We ate at the Brasserie in the lobby which was good, but a little over priced, so don't be afraid to venture out.  Also there was a DJ playing and there were 2 tables with people at it, so it was a little loud and unnecessary.",5,2014,10,05
206,Outstanding service,"The hotel is located in a great area, easy to get to shopping and dining. The best part of the hotel is its employees. My wife and I had a drink at the Roof Top bar and she mentioned to our server Sean, during a conversation that her throat was a little scratchy, by the time we returned to our room he had a cup on the night stand with tea bag and a small jar of honey waiting for her with a nice note. Every employee we came in contact with could not have been nicer! Would highly recommend staying there.",5,2014,10,04
206,"5 stars promised, 5 stars delivered!","An extended weekend stay with my 19 year old son in Dublin was excellent, also because of the excellent services and infrastructure of this hotel. Staff was without any exception (!) fully focused on ensuring an superb stay for all guests. Although we had no entitlement to a room with two queen beds instead of one kingsize (the only one available when we booked), we were offered a change of room for the next day! The transfer including luggage had been arranged whilst we were in town. The room was as clean as it could be (never seen like this) and airco worked well. Been in (too) many hotels in my life, this will rate within the top 5 ever visited without any doubt. Top recommendation and not too remote if you like a 20 minute walk to the city centre.",5,2014,10,03
206,"We are totally amazed by the Hotel, the view and the Staff!","The Marker Hotel made our trip to Dublin more than marvelous! 
We arrived very early from a long flight and were directed by the staff to relax in the beautiful SPA while our room was available...such a nice gesture!
It was the perfect location, wonderful room, very modern and beautiful hotel with very friendly staff, very clean, (while walking to our room everyday a wonderful aroma ""of freshly cleaned"" greeted us), had a very nice dinner at the restaurant. We had a little issue with the shower but was taken care off quickly and well. Wonderful experience we would recommend this hotel highly and hope to go back soon. ",5,2014,10,03
206,Absolutely fabulous!,"We stayed two nights in a deluxe room with a great view over the canal. The rooms are a decent size, lovely big bed and a calming, monochrome decor. The bathroom was modern and spacious with a decent shower and bath. Everything was exceptionally clean and the room staff friendly and helpful. We visited the spa for a swim in the pool on Sunday morning - one of the most beautiful pools and jacuzzis we have come across in a city hotel. We didn't eat in the restaurant so cannot comment on the food, although we did manage to get up to the rooftop bar on Sunday afternoon, which has fantastic views and great staff. The service throughout the hotel was exemplary. Would thoroughly recommend.",5,2014,09,30
206,Fabulous!!!,"We travel extensively for work and pleasure and the stay at The Marker (4 nights), hands down, was the best experience ever. The decor, cleanliness, service, attention to detail - it all exceeded our expectations. Loved the coffee press with good quality ground coffee and the evening chocolates:) 
Early morning check in was a huge bonus after an overnight flight. Every member of the staff that we encountered was courteous, helpful, and seemed genuinely happy to be working there.
Well done, The Marker, and thank you for a great stay.",5,2014,09,29
206,a little bit disapointed,"On arrival my husband and I were impressed as everything looked lovely.

Our problems were..
A damp smelling room which we were moved from for the second night of our stay but meant we had to pack all our stuff up and unpack when in the new room. 

A late wake up call..
Although only 6minutes late that coupled with our taxi request for 5am not being ordered by Reception staff (as informed by the taxi driver) resulted in a panicky departure and only just making our flight on time.

Maybe i over expected but we were stopping in a 5* hotel?

The staff were mainly polite and attentive there were just a few minor issues for us and I believe the stay was extremely expensive for our experience.     ",3,2014,09,29
206,A perfect weekend escape,"I'll start this review by saying that my partner and I worked a very tough summer in the hospitality industry and we wanted a weekend escape to relax. We both have keen eyes for how staff treat and take care of their customers, and professionalism, that said we could not have a more perfect weekend.
We arrived on a Friday to be greeted outside by a very friendly staff member who welcomed us and while the concierge checked us in we relaxed in the lobby and had top notch coffees to perk us up for our day. After being told our room might not be ready for a number of hours due to a full house over the last few days. Our room was ready within 30 minutes or being there. Arriving on the fifth floor to a dark hallway giving an amazing atmosphere of tranquility to the hotel. Needless to say the rooms were modern and sleek. From seeing the television  welcome you with your name on screen to a marble bathroom of the utmost elegance. Breakfast is a must at the marker. Food for all types of eaters, from frys to fruit salads and drinks service to a tee. The rooftop bar is an essential visit  for all guests of the marker. The only elevator in the building to take you to 7th floor rooftop gives a special vip ambience and would excite anyone on their visit. A truly amazing experience on a sunny evening with a surreal view of Dublin City. Dinner afterwards was just a super treat. Excellent service and exquisite food. A lovely floor manager gave us sublime tips on where we should attend for drinks in the city since we were unfamiliar with Dublin. The Marker is a flawless hotel in the heart of Dublin and I cannot wait to come back next year.
Thank you for making our weekend so special
Sean",5,2014,09,28
206,Gorgeous hotel with rooftop bar and rockstar pool,"The Marker is a world class hotel that we could not fault.
Drinks at the rooftop bar where great, blankets are a nice touch even though it was summer its still Ireland !
Rooms are spacious and luxurious, service is excellent.
Highlight above all else is the indoor pool, steam room, jazuzzi and gym area - really top shelf and beautifully finished. What a bonus !

Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer at The Marker",5,2014,09,24
206,The only dissapointment was that I couldn't stay longer!,"My husband selected the Marker as a suprise venue for our anniversary. The exceptional 5 star treatment from the staff combined with amazing spacious room and bathroom, a WOW pool/thermal area was breathtaking. Make sure you have breakfast there, too!! Some of the details I loved: blue ink coloured carpet, black floor tiles, the colour combination blue/yellow, large windows, flowers in the foyer, etc etc. One thing to improve: a soft closure toilet seat would be nice.",5,2014,09,23
206,EXCELENT,"We were very happy with your treatment at The Marker during our stay from 7 September till 9 September. We could see from the moment of our arrival that the hotel service has a great quality, both because of its comfortable and appropriate facilities, as well as service and constant concern for our comfort. 

Thanks to the team that made our stay a good time, comforting and secure. I would like to comment how pleased I was with the service provided to us by Nina at the Spa. We have visited many hotel spa‚Äôs and have found most of them pretty good and the staff generally friendly. Nina has by far outpaced every one of them.

We are sure that when we return to your city, we will go back to your hotel.",5,2014,09,23
206,Superb hotel in the Dublin Docklands,"Very stylish hotel with excellent service.  Our room had one of the most comfortable beds we have ever had the pleasure of sleeping in, even better than our own!  En suite was great with a bath and a walk in shower and oodles of marble!  The food in the restaurant and bar was of good quality, although not cheap, and beautifully presented and served.  There can be few better locations for a pre-diner drink than the roof top cocktail bar.  The breakfast buffet was amazing.  
Valet parking service worked very well, although they were a little perplexed by how we got so much luggage into my wife's small convertible.

Very convenient for the Bord Gas Theatre and O2 Arena.  A bit of a walk into town, but not an unpleasant walk by any means.",5,2014,09,23
206,"rude staff on check in, missing so many ""little things""","The person who check us in was extremely rude.. When I had to pay I checked to see how much was being charged for, and the person behind the counter, I believe his name was Robert.. had Charged an extra 50 euros.. When I queried this he rudely snapped ""its a security deposit, I already told you this"" being slightly hard of hearing I did not hear him say this, so I think it was unfair and very very rude.. I was happy to pay the deposit but think this was handled badly... Also there was a smell of damp in the room, which was fine when the aircon or heating was on, and only noticeable when we walked into the room each time.. Over all I think it was over priced for what it is, and so many ""little things where missing"" no one offered to help us with our bags, our bottle of water was never replaced (we where staying the same time as some friends and they had three or four bottles), at breakfast we where only given one slice of toast each with no one asking if we wanted more and no one offered any more tea or coffee than our first ""allocation"" I would expect all these things to be a matter of course for a hotel claiming to be so high class, but for us it was the lack of little things that ruined our stay.. Honestly I think the hotel is trying to be something its not, and charge far too much for a room only stay.. the roof top bar was nice though, and provide blankets if it gets too cold",2,2014,09,23
206,"Great place, very accomodating, nice staff, good bar","During our holiday in Ireland we spent 3 nights in the Marker Hotel after getting a good deal online. It was very affordable for our three night stay and from the minute we arrived the staff was very helpful and directed us very well on where we could get food, good drinks, cigars and other luxuries around Dublin. Our room was very cozy and had everything we needed for our stay, comfortable bed, good TV for when we needed to relax, shower and bathtub with lots of hot water and a very helpful guide book on the table. Breakfast in the morning was great, my wife loved the bacon! When we had the chance too we got a drink in the bar and the bartenders were always great, one in particular seemed to be there all the time and each time we talked to him seemed happy. It was a very pleasant stay and when we return to Ireland in the future is a definite stay.",4,2014,09,23
206,This hotel redefines standards of excellence for hotels in Dublin.,"I have stayed in this hotel on several occasions and all that I can say is that it is very difficult to fault it.

I work in the hospitality sector myself and I like to think that I have a keen eye for detail, from check in to dinner, drinks in the bar or on the roof top, the welcome you receive on check-in to the high standard of work in accommodations all show us that Mr Sheil their General Manager together with his different Managers were busy writing their procedures well before the hotel opened and have implemented them with perfection, and let me tell you their organization works perfectly. 

For me the Marker is the best option if you are looking for five star service in both fashionable and youthful surroundings with beautiful cuisine and a great bar to match!   
My friends and I have spent the last few weeks deciding what to do for new years and so that everyone can bring in the New Year together, this coming year we‚Äôll be celebrating it in Dublin and I can tell you that when we decided on our destination the hotel we were going to stay in needed no reflection!

Bravo!!!",5,2014,09,22
206,"A pleasant surprise, expected a business hotel and got much more","I was uncertain about the location and expected a typical business hotel.  My worries where unfounded. The hotel is a short taxi ride from the downtown center.  The area has a young demographic and appears to be growing. The hotel itself was sleek. Our room large, quiet, and comfortable. Service was friendly and professional. There was an attention to detail such as water bottles placed in our car by valet parking. The roof bar offered a nice view plus blankets in case you caught a chill. The restaurant served excellent food with attentive service.  My only complaint is the physical space of the restaurant for dinner.  It felt more like an offshoot of the lobby, almost an afterthought.  The atmosphere did not compliment the food.",5,2014,09,20
206,Slick city hotel,This hotel is perfect for an overnight for shows in bord gais or three arena. Loved the bedrooms & bathrooms as they were quite spacious. The pool and spa area is amazing. The decor in General was a bit modern and minimalist for me and was disappointed that rooftop bar was closed. Breakfast was everything you would expect from a 5 star. Would be perfect for a girls night away.,5,2014,09,19
206,roof top bar,was invited for tasting dinner at Marker Hotel - firstly champagne cocktails on the rooftop bar - excellent venue - well looked after then down to the restaurant for 6 course champagne dinner - excellent - 5 stars all round,5,2014,09,17
206,My new favourite hotel in Dublin,"I am a regular business traveller, and do enjoy my creature comforts especially when away for a few days and you know you'll end up with some time in the room. My company has used the hotel as a venue so felt I would give it a go based on recommendations from my Irish team. I was not disappointed. I got a complimentary upgrade to Deluxe King room (thanks to Erica Shiels for that) which has a lovely comfy bed, a desk, and sofa to sit on which is handy if you have guests.

The shower was heavenly, and a fine selection of bath and shower gels and lotions. The standard of finishing was something else. 

If you're hungry there is the choice of The Marker Bar - Very tasty and different bar food, or the Brasserie which will impress your clients if you are inviting them for a business dinner.

Overall the staff really do go out of their way to help you and ensure you're having a good time. I must be on a run of good hotels as I am not one to hand out 5*'s very often. Credit where credit is due, and I shall be back to The Marker again in October. Can I get that free upgrade again please? ;-)

If you are in any doubt, it is worth paying a little extra for the quality experience you will receive. There is plenty of places to eat, and a taxi rank outside if you want to head into St Stephens Square or Temple Bar.",5,2014,09,16
206,Truly fabulous!,"Having celebrated our 15th anniversary in Sicily with our children during the summer, we wanted a weekend of luxury for a second child-free celebration and decided on a stay at The Marker.  A few days before we arrived, I contacted reservations and explained that we would be celebrating our anniversary and asked if I could purchase a bottle of Champagne to have in our room on arrival.  Sarah emailed be straight back with a bar menu to choose the Champagne from and was really helpful then the day before we travelled, called me to double check the reservation and to see if there was anything else we wanted or needed - so far, so impressed!  We got a cab from the airport to the hotel which took around 25ish minutes and cost 25 Euros.  The cab driver was really knowledgeable about the area and spoke highly of the hotel.  First impressions of the hotel were great - it looks amazing, has a fab location right on the river/docks on a buzzing square bordered by the theatre and bars/cafes.  The doorman, concierge and desk staff were really friendly, we were checked in immediately and were told that we were to be upgraded to a luxury corner suite with the hotel's compliments which completely blew us away!!  Thanks once again for that lovely gesture!!  The corridors to the rooms are painted in a very dark purple and low-lit, which actually I really loved and our room was stunning.  Huge bed, sofa, table & chairs and a desk with three floor to ceiling window's overlooking the docks and square and the most beautiful black marble bathroom.  There were good toiletries in the bathroom (but no bubble bath for that fab huge bath, although they probably would have got us some if we had asked!), hairdryer, iron and board, umbrella, shoe cleaning bits and bobs, kettle, tea and coffee with biscuits and a well stocked mini bar (50 euros a night is taken for this on arrival but refunded if you don't use it, which we didn't) and air-con/heating.  The icing on the top of this amazingness was a slice of gorgeous cake with a welcome message piped onto the plate and a personalised note from the management along with our pre-ordered champagne.  I could have moved in and stayed forever at this point...  We went for a wander around the dock area and down the river towards the sea, then returned to change for dinner and ate at the Caf√© Bar H opposite the hotel, which was good (reviewed separately).  On returning to the hotel, the room had been turned down, which was a lovely touch too.  In fact, the room was serviced twice a day on both days, fab!  

Next morning, we ventured down to breakfast (I pre-paid for this when we booked) and couldn't have been happier with the selection - there was a great choice of pastries, fruits, cereals, meats and cheeses and breads and a hot buffet of scrambled eggs, bacon, black pudding and sausages (all locally produced) and mushrooms and fresh tomatoes.  There was also an a la carte menu with eggs benedict, French toast, porridge etc at an extra cost.  Tea/coffee, juices and toast were served to us at our table by our incredibly friendly waitress.  I spotted what I think was a ""make your own Virgin Mary"" table, (especially for hangovers?), haha - nice touch!  Well fed and feeling happy, we decided to walk into the main city centre and then out to the Guinness Storehouse beyond ( a dream destination of my Husband's).  The walk to the centre took around 15 minutes and was a nice one then it was probably another 25ish onwards to the Storehouse.  We might have got a cab if we had known it was that far, but the walk was pleasant and we saw Trinity College, St. Patricks Cathedral and Dublin Castle along the way.  The Guinness Storehouse is well worth a visit even if you aren't a Guinness fan (as i'm not), it's interesting and the Gravity Bar at the top has amazing 360 degree views of Dublin and beyond and I was able to use my voucher for my free pint of Guinness (part of the entry fee) for a coke instead.  We walked back to the centre and wandered Grafton Street, sat for a while in Stephen's Green then explored Temple Bar and the area north of the river and had an ok lunch at Fitzsimon's (reviewed separately) before walking back to the hotel.

That evening, having heard great things about the hotel's Rooftop Bar, we changed and headed that way.  I was looking forward to having some great food and a bottle of Champagne while enjoying the amazing views of the docks, city and mountains beyond, although I had heard that it get's very busy and entry isn't guaranteed so I didn't get my hopes up.  We spoke to the gentleman at the entrance downstairs who radioed the bar and then sent ourselves and another couple up in the lift, I was excited, however on arrival we were told that there were no tables for 2 at that moment and if we didn't mind sharing we could sit at a large communal table, which we did.  We were under the impression that as we went up for a table for 2, that we would get one when one became available and the couple we arrived with were shown to one within a couple of minutes which seemed to confirm this.  There were plenty of waiters around but no-one approached us to take drinks orders, so my Husband went to the bar and ordered and was told that they would bring the drinks to us.  I'm not sure what it was exactly, but the service up there was not the friendly and attentive service that we had experienced downstairs and we didn't feel especially comfortable or welcome, a feeling that only grew as over the following 25 minutes we watched 5 separate couples exit the lift and be shown straight away to tables for 2...  Eventually, with the lack of atmosphere, feeling uncomfortable and sat at a too-low-to-eat table with views over the back of the hotel (although beyond that was nice), we decided it wasn't going to be the amazing night we planned, paid and left.  I had wanted to speak with the gentleman who was in charge of greeting and seating people, but he had vanished so I left it.  Downstairs, we asked if we needed to be seated at the lobby bar or if we could just grab a table and we were shown to a table, given menu's with more of that super-friendly hospitality.  We went on to enjoy an evening of cocktails (you must try the cucumber and elderflower Martini's - superb!) and great food (club sandwich and chips and a huge portion of Irish smoked salmon with bread and salad) - I can't put my finger on why the atmosphere and service is so much better downstairs as it's the same hotel, but there is a definite difference here.  We had a really, really great evening in the end, so all was not lost.

Sunday morning at breakfast, although she was not our waitress this time, our waitress from the previous morning came over to our table and had a chat which was lovely and the food was just as good as the day before.

We truly did have the most fabulous stay, it's so rare to find such attentive and friendly service in a hotel of this calibre - instead of feeling like a room number, we were made to feel like actual people and this along with the fab, huge clean room, amazing facilities and the location make this a ""must-stay"" hotel - yes it's a touch pricey but worth every single penny.  You won't be disappointed, I promise you.  We will definitely stay here again in the future and hopefully next time we will have some time to make use of the amazing spa and have a better Rooftop Bar experience.  Thank you all so much for a memorable and fantastic anniversary weekend, it was incredible and we'll never forget it :)",5,2014,09,16
206,Modern treat,"Stayed here for 2 nights as a treat for my boyfriend as we were going to a concert in July. The whole hotel is very modern & stylish & is maintained to a very high standard, as was expected. It is pricey, but you get what you pay for. 
Service was extremely good; reception staff were friendly & knowledgeable, restaurant staff were very friendly & attentive, cleaning staff were also friendly & tidy the room multiple times a day if you wish. Everyone did everything they could to help & make us feel welcome, which isn't always the case being a young couple.
The room & spa facilities were amazing & our meal was lovely, even though our tastebuds were tested a little by the 'haute cuisine'. 
Our rooftop bar experience was somewhat ruined by the rain but the ambiance was still great & it felt like a vip area with great views of the city.
The only negative I can think of is that the hotel is quite hard to find if you aren't familiar with the area, we drove around in circles before finding the entrance as it's a bit of a maze of one-way streets & the hotel front faces away from main traffic. Once you find it though, it's easy to walk or get a bus wherever you need to go.
Would definitely love to stay here again!",5,2014,09,16
206,MODERN HOTEL IN DUBLIN,"I recently stayed at the Marker in Dublin, it is a beautiful, contemporary hotel with a lovely roof top bar.  The gym and pool/spa are very nice.  The interior halls of the hotel are quite dim which may be a plus or minus.  The surrounding area has a few nice restaurants.  i did not dine at the hotel.  Everyone was very nice and friendly.  I especially liked Stefan the bell man, what a friendly lad.
I would stay here again.  Keep in mind this hotel is south of the river.  A $7 cab fare will take you to Grafton St.",5,2014,09,15
206,Amazing experience,What an incredible hotel. The staff cannot do enough for you and genuinely felt like a celebrity on the rooftop bar. The spa was jaw dropping. We spent 2 nights here for our 10th Wedding Anniversary and was kid free for the first time since we had them and loved every minute of Dublin and this wonderful hotel. ,5,2014,09,15
206,Dublin's dockland palace! 5*,"My friend and I stayed, on the sixth floor, for two nights in room 623. The hotel is very stylish and yet the staff are very approachable, helpful and genuine. They made us feel very welcome.
The room we had was excellent. It was spacious, head two single excellent sized beds. A desk with a TV that did everything apart from make you a cup of tea ;)
There was a well supplied mini bar, worth a great choice of wine, beer and soft drinks. There were crisps, nuts, biscuits, chocolates, teas and ground coffee. All nearly hidden away in a cupboard.
The bathroom was excellent and again, well stocked with towels and toiletries.
In the wardrobe there was a safe, bathrobes, iron, ironing board and hair dryer.
There was a table and two comfortable tub chairs with a lovely welcome note, chocolates and bottled water.
I have some very minor issues with the room. 1. We understood how to operate the heating but the room was still far too hot for us. We turned the aircon down, turned it off, many combinations, and still we ended sleeping on top of the bed sheets. I did call housekeeping but there was nothing that could be done. 2. The air conditioning, I assume, was in some way drawing cooked food smells through into the room. It wasn't a big problem but was noticeable. 
The docklands address is lovely, but there isn't a huge amount to do there. There are several restaurants, coffee bars, general shops and specialist ones.
We enjoyed fruit cocktails from the bar, these were excellent!  We had breakfast, which was excellent...you could enjoy fruit, traditional lightly fried/grilled food, continental meats cheeses and pastries...you name it and it was there.
Check in/check out was fine, they require a E50/night deposit but that was credited to my debit card on departure.
All in all we had an excellent stay. If you can make sure you visit the genuine Italian coffee shop, Il Travatorie (spelling??) They make the most amazing cakes and coffee...yummmmmm",5,2014,09,14
206,Fab Hotel,The Marker 5* Hotel in Grand Canal Square is a must if you are planning a night away. Right next door to the Bord Gais Theatre and 20 min walk to the 3 theatre. The rooms are beautifully laid out. The front lobby is so white and beautiful with it's polished plaster finish. There is no colours to be found the building is held up by glass panels. Valet parking as you drive up in your car. My only one disappointment was the roof bar was closed to a private party but would have been nice to just go up and to have a look. Would I stay again for sure no doubts about it. Fab time had. ,5,2014,09,14
206,So Modern...,"Unfortunately we got in late because of travel so we didn't get to enjoy the hotel like I had planned especially given what I had paid for it. It is a very cool spot and a newer area. The architecture is amazing. Wish we had more time here..,",4,2014,09,13
206,One of the best,"Staff is genuinely kind and helpful, there is a big and convenient spa with infinity smimming pool for relax, building and room are amazing. Food is not great with room service, so i recommend you explore nearby restaurants. Would recommend and go back!",5,2014,09,13
206,Great hotel but not ideal location for tourists.,"5 star hotel. Rooms and facilities were top notch. Only downfall was the location. For tourist like myself, it was a good 15 minute walk from the city centre. Other than that, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Turn down services are always a nice touch as well.",5,2014,09,12
206,Good Hotel - Valet Parking!,"Stayed here one night on the way back from holiday.  It was a little bit confusing trying to find the front of the hotel.  However, the room was nice and it was quiet, the staff were very helpful, but it would have been nice if someone had come over to us when we parked outside the hotel for the valet parking, as it was absolutely pouring with rain, and my husband got soaked, trying to get someone's attention, we had no instruction of what to do when we arrived, previously for this service, we have just put our hazard lights on, I know this is not important to many people, but it doesn't take much to pop out with an umbrella.  Food was nice, the waitress was lovely helpful and chatty.  Not sure I like the modern design of the 'lobby restaurant', looks a bit like a service station.  But all in all it was a good stay, if only for one night.",4,2014,09,11
206,"Beautiful Hotel, fabulous service, overall an excellent experience.","This hotel is located in a nice clean area of Dublin a short walk from the busy city area, not too far though. Everything about the place is of an excellent standard.  The rooms were clean, a good size, lovely bathrooms.  The spa and gym area were beautfully clean, well maintained and a pleasure to use. The restaurant downstairs was quite good, not perfect, however the buffet breakfast was great. I would highly recommend this hotel to stay at while in Dublin.  Make sure you have a drink in the upstairs bar.",5,2014,09,11
206,Perfect for business,"Fab five star in Dublin city! Stayed here for two nights and the staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. Check in and check out was so swift and easy. 
Great selection at breakfast. Ate on the rooftop bar one night, stunning view. Room is so spacious and clean. The pool is great for a swim and I loved the full body massage that I got!! I was so chilled out and relaxed after it. I will definitely return!!",5,2014,09,10
206,Excellent,"You do undoubtedly get what you pay for but we still left the hotel feeling we got value for money. We decided to pay that little bit more as the reviews were good. I tried hard to find fault ... maybe a chip of paint or spots on the carpet or a cranky member of staff! But found none of the above. The place is spotless, the staff are unobtrusive yet very helpful, they had a Happy Anniversary note and some eclairs for us in the room for our arrival. Nina showed us to our room and was just such a lovely pleasant girl. Breakfast was a lovely buffet with lots to eat.  The spa is lovely and the gym is not over-done but perfect. Jacuzzi was really big, nice pool, nice chairs by the pool, steam room and sauna. It's in a really lovely area near the Bord Gais Theatre and right beside the canal and it feels very much like a holiday destination.  Above all, people do make your stay and I have to give 10 out of 10 to customer service. Beds were 'turned down' and towels replaced when we were out during the day (stayed 2 nights), sweets left on the bed, bottled water in the room and tea/coffee.  Nice restaurants close by if you need to pop out for some air and a coffee/bite to eat and it's not that far from the city centre .. only a few minutes in a taxi.",5,2014,09,10
206,Pure Luxury,"Getting to the hotel was easy, we booked transfers from the airport to Cardiff Lane and it's less than a 5 minute walk to the hotel as soon as you get off. When Checking in to the hotel we were greeted with a lovely warm welcome and instantly felt at home! 
As soon as our bedroom door opened we were both gobsmacked, our room was beautiful and extremely big with a hidden gem! Whilst we were exploring there was a knock at the door and when we opened it we were greeted by a member of staff with a beautifully decorated slice of cake and a letter welcoming us to the hotel. 
The room was big, with 2 single twin beds which were more like small doubles and were super comfy! The bathroom was out of this world, we both couldn't wait to use both the shower and bath they were just so appealing!
We went out to explore Dublin on our first night and when we returned to our room we were shocked to find our beds had been turned down and chocolates were left on our pillows.
The hotel goes above and beyond to make you feel at home and the staff were all so helpful.
By the end of our holiday we didn't want to leave and already want to go back!
The only downside is we didn't visit the rooftop bar or the spa as were just so knackered each day, next time hopefully!!
If you're planning to visit Dublin and want to relax choose The Marker, you won't regret it.",5,2014,09,10
206,Amazing spa and treatments ,A friend got me a voucher for the spa so I went to the spa for back massage and facial.  The  spa  area is beautiful very modern and sleek and luxurious facilities.  Louise  did my treatments.  The massage  was very thorough and felt great and the facial was excellent great products and really relaxing.  Louise and all staff were friendly and professional and knowledgeable.  Definitely among the best massage and facial I have had would highly recommend it! ,5,2014,09,10
206,Great hotel and location for a city break,"Well we have just got home from an amazing 3 nights stay at the marker hotel. I booked this is a surprise birthday present for my girlfriend. I told the hotel this and in arrival they had left a nice little note and birthday cake for her :) nice touch.
First impressions were amazing. Looks really classy and posh. every member of staff in the hotel were so professional and polite.
We had a room on the second floor (226) which had a great view of the canal and a huge bathroom with bath. However like many other reviewers the big problem with the rooms is storage! There are no drawers other then one small one in the desk. Really needs addressing.
We used the spa which was brilliant and extremely relaxing.
One bonus with our booking was when booking on trivago it said breakfast not included however on arrival they told us it was so had a result :) breakfast was also great but one slight disappointment was the menu said potato scones which I was curious to try but they never had these. Other then that was perfect!!
Location was also great. 10 minute walk to temple bar or the shopping areas. Or ‚Ç¨8 in a cab.
Would return in a heartbeat. Thank you to all the marker staff for making this break truly memorable ",5,2014,09,09
206,The Mark is On the Mark,"Just an outstanding hotel!    I visited with a friend a we stayed 4 nights.    We enjoyed the location as it is centrally located to the things we wanted to see and do.   Easy to get a taxi out front too.   The doormen and front desk were very friendly and efficient.   The room was extremely clean and well taken care of every day.  The Marker Spa is awesome; I enjoyed the Indian Head Massage.   The Rooftop Lounge is a scenic view.
  If I had to take away a 1/2 star it would be for slightly slow service both times visiting the rooftop lounge and in the lobby bar.  However, I without a doubt give The Marker 4.5 stars out of 5 - and since there are no half stars I am happy to round up to 5 stars! 
I would stay here again!  You should too.",5,2014,09,08
206,Great location but the 'black' hotel is seriously lacking in storage space,"Excellent staff and service, hotel is spotlessly clean and great location overlooking Grand Canal basin and next to Borg Energy theatre. Arrived early and impressed that we could have our room at 10.30 am but I think this may have been luck that it hadn't been occupied the night before. Room had reasonable view towards Grand Canal Basin but as we were on the 6th floor the window was set back and there was an area with walls on either side that felt as if it should have a balcony.Really can't understand why the rooms on this floor didn't have windows flush with the hotel wall as it lost room space.  I've had larger rooms and the bathroom was very small and dark with black tiles.  When I asked if we could have a room with bath, was told we would have to upgrade to deluxe. Unpacked to find that there was only one drawer ! As we had a twin, there were 3 bedside units but none of them had drawers to put personal things in; very bad design in my opinion. The hotel did give us a bottle of wine for the inconvenience which was appreciated. Twin beds were very very comfortable and 4 ft wide which was great. Slight permanent hum from somewhere even when off; not good for a light sleeper.  In room coffee was a sachet for a cafetiere and no decaf which is standard in most hotels therefore had the hassle of having to order decaf and have it delivered. Everything in the hotel is 'black' including the dark corridors, swimming pool and even down to the black pencil. Apart from being dark, the swimming pool was fantastic as was the Jacuzzi and steam room.  Rooftop bar amazing, good tapas and prices quite reasonable but could do with some heaters in the outside areas.  Plenty of nice cafes and a couple of shops round the canal basin to get lunch and breakfast.",4,2014,09,08
206,Outstanding,"Recently spent only one night here but we were extremely impressed with the entire experience. The hotel was modern, fresh and very well appointed. The decor was fresh and modern. The staff were excellent, very friendly and accommodating, we were travelling with our young baby and we received a free room upgrade and all the assistance we needed. We had a wonderful meal in the restaurant (though prices were a little steep). The location was great for us, nice area to walk around without being right in the centre. We travel a lot and have stayed in hundreds of hotels but The Marker really stood out for us. Would definitely return and recommend.",5,2014,09,08
206,Amazing mood music and spaces to be in,"Out stay started with a free upgrade so it was always going to be good! We had a really fun view out over the square which lights up at night. The bathrooms are excellent, spacious and very well designed as is all this hotel. The dark corridors are a shock but they're quite fun really. You MUST go to the rooftop cafe / bar and try the snacks there, great bold flavouring. The pool is very peaceful. Everywhere has background music which you might imagine would be annoying but it's perfectly pitched so it's just nice. Staff are friendly and helpful, beds very comfy. The decor is quirky and keeps you interested. The docks are fun to walk around and the place is quite cheap considering the quality of it - go!",5,2014,09,08
206,Trendy & Comfortable,This hotel is trendy and cosmopolitan. Our room was spacious and comfortable. Wonderful view of Grand Canal Square. Great food and great cocktails! The roof top garden bar was delightful on the sunny evening we were there. Lovely staff made our stay even more pleasant.,5,2014,09,08
206,Amazing Hotel,"The Hotel is beautiful, the staff is helpful and very friendly . We stayed there for 3 nights and I did not want to leave. Breakfast is well worth it, don't miss it and the dinner was equal that of any 5 star restaurant .
The rooftop bar is a must. The view from the there is awesome
Our room had a great view and a beautiful marble bathroom with heated floors and a large tub.
The pool is beautiful and quiet and the have a nice fitness area. 
Truly an awesome Hotel !",5,2014,09,08
206,Modern with old-style warmth,"My wife and I spent two lovely nights at The Marker recently.  And we were both impressed and appreciative of not only the facilities, but also of the staff.  They were more than attentive; they were well trained, responsive, and displayed a warmth that complimented their professionalism to make it a truly enjoyable experience.  And whenever we return to Dublin, The Marker will be at the top of our list of places to stay.",5,2014,09,07
206,Great hotel...can't find any drawers!,"The Marker is an ultra modern but lovely hotel set on Grand Canal Square Hotel in the newly refurbished Docklands area of Dublin.  It is an easy (15 minute) walk to Temple Bar, Saint Stephens Square and Grafton Street.  The rooms are quite spacious and luxuriously appointed but as noted in the title of my review I can't find any drawers!  Plenty of wardrobe space, but no drawers which I find slightly odd.  It is a minor detail though.  The downstairs bar serves amazing cocktails and the best smoked salmon I have had for a while.  Looking forward to trying the rooftop bar overlooking the River Liffey this evening which specializes in tapas.  Would certainly stay here again.",4,2014,09,05
206,Great,"Stayed here for 5 nights had a great experience ,staff were helpful and friendly . Rooms very nice ,bathroom excellent great big bath . Only downside was it as a 15- 20 minute walk into town , still worth it .",4,2014,09,04
206,The Marker Hit Its Mark!,"We stayed at The Marker for four nights in August whilst attending the Croke Park Classic football match between Penn State (WE ARE!) and UCF.  The Marker has a great location, not in the craziness of Temple Bar. The modern d√©cor was very cool.  Room furnishings were very comfortable.  Breakfast was delicious--recommend the pre-paid 15 Euro pp to save a little.  Rooftop bar had fantastic views of the city.  Most of all, the service was excellent. From the reception to the bar to the restaurant to the maid service, all was top-notch.  I would recommend The Marker without hesitation and hope to stay there again.",5,2014,09,04
206,Pit stop on the way home,"Our journey home to the UK from Ireland entailed a stop in the Marker for one night. We really enjoyed our stay, the room was fabulous, the facilities were plentiful. Our bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom facilities excellent. The staff were very helpful and accommodated our very early start by having breakfast ready to take away.
We dined in the hotel due to the awful weather, the restaurant is a little impersonal being along the hall from the lobby. the food was good, the choice of wines extensive and a little expensive too.
The high point throughout our stay was the attitude of the staff always very helpful (even a personal early morning alarm call) and made our stay really enjoyable.",5,2014,09,03
206,Chic and modern with A* service,"If you like stylish modern hotels this is for you! Set in the heart of Dublin's developing docklands area it is ideally placed for both the new and equally stunning Bord Gais Energy Theatre and a stones throw from the O2. Lovely rooms, amazingly helpful staff and a beautiful spa await you. Unfortunately we were unable to sample the delights of the roof top bar but everything else A1. Just a couple of tiny niggles. Breakfast was nice but disappointed in the selection of fruits on offer (prunes/apricots would have been a welcome addition) also room servicing is a little OTT.  They wanted to clean our room at 8.30 am (we had arrived at midnight! ) they then wanted to check the cleaning and replenish throughout the day. We popped a 'do not disturb' note on the door the following day. It was more expensive than what we usually pay but worth it for a special treat. Non-residents can use the spa if they have a treatment priced over ‚Ç¨50. Our only disappointment was that the roof top bar wasn't open during our stay. Exemplary staff - well done!",5,2014,09,03
206,Great staff,"We stayed at the marker hotel in Dublin this August. We both had a wonderful time and I would recommend a hotel because it has a wonderful staff, spa, pool and service.

The decor is lovely.  They did however, charge us ‚Ç¨30 a night extra for our room saying they were going to upgrade us from a deluxe room to a better room, yet the room was no different than any other deluxe room.

Otherwise except for the  bait and switch, I highly recommend this hotel.  The staff is lovely, helpful and makes a stay very enjoyable.",5,2014,09,02
206,You get what you pay for,"After a 4 night stay I started to get accustomed to the attention to detail this hotel offers, everyone was friendly and helpful but not overbearing. The room was first class and the only small thing it was lacking was cupboard/drawer space. The pool area was lovely and being able to return to your room in a thick robe and with a dry costume added to the pleasure.

The breakfast was superb, with simply everything on the menu. 

We had one evening meal here too which was equally as enjoyable as the rest of the stay and of the same standard as the hotel. The service was excellent too, just the right amount of attention  and a professional manner to accommodate our limited time due to our theatre booking.               

When we have saved up, we would return here anytime.",5,2014,09,02
206,"Nice hotel, odd experience","Myself and my wife and young child (22 months) booked a suite in this hotel at short notice on Thursday 21 August.

Upon arrival, circa 9pm, we immediately started making enquiries about room services - we had been told in advance that food was served until 11pm.  Over the course of about 20 minutes, we made a number of enquiries with the room service attendant about a number of dishes.  The first enquiry was about a Thai curry on their menu, which looked like a vegetarian dish.  We were advised that it was a chicken dish and that the base of the sauce was made from a commercial paste.  Not liking the sound of that we then enquiried about pasta disc and were also informed that the sauce in this dish was a commercial sauce.  Our next enquiry was about the steak and we were informed it was an 8oz steak but at ‚Ç¨29 we felt this was too expensive.  In the end we ordered simple fish n' chips which is not what we felt like but we were hungry.

After dinner we ordered two drinks to our room.  There was an inordinate delay and after about 10/15 minutes room service rang us to apologise for the delay.  This woke our young child and just as we had her settled the phone rang again, this time to advise us that room service were at our door.  Needless to say our child awoke again and by the time we had her settled we were too tired to enjoy the drinks. 

The room itself was very cold when we arrived - given that we had booked it last minute, it seemed that they had left the heat off and overlooked ensuring that the room was warmed up for us.  My wife found the room cold even after it had warmed up (about an hour later) and I would put this down to the cold colour on the walls.  The corner suite that we were given was aesthetically suited to business than pleasure.

Breakfast the following morning was mixed.  The buffet contains the usual selection of cereals, breads, cheese, yogurts, etc. and this is well presented.  The hot food looked distinctly unappetising.  It consisted of bacon, saussages, saute potato, tomato served on mushrooms and scambled eggs.  Each of these was separately served in what would appear to be a bain marie with a glass covering.  This problem is that steam from the hot water was condensing on the inside of the glass cover and food that had been grilled and fried had the appearance of being steamed.  My wife took a selection of food and found it lukewarm and overcooked.

I ordered two fried eggs and was presented with two eggs that were cooked hard on the underneath and cooked to a plastic consistency on top.  The waitress looked unsure when she presented these and when I enquiried how the were cooked I was advised they had been fried then placed under a grill to ensure they were cooked on top.  I returned the eggs and was given two better cooked eggs instead.

In all, the room service and breakfast experience is mediocre at best and the room was cold.  Except for the room service team, the staff were extremely polite and charming.  To be honest, I felt that the politeness was excessive.

We checked out of the hotel early and went to the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  Although this hotel is older and shows a lot of wear and tear, our stay there was delightful (see separate review).  

We gave our feedback upon departing and this was handled very well, both by a duty manager and by the guest relations manager.  They have explained that we were wrongly advised about the food by room service.  But the bottom line is that we spent a lot of money and this was a once in a lifetime chance to have two nights away without 2 or our 3 children.

In my opinion this is at best a 3 star hotel and I would not recommend it for pleasure.",1,2014,09,02
206,This hotel made our vacation wonderful!,"We loved the rooms with beautiful contemporary decor and sooooo comfortable beds.  The bathrooms were wonderful with a all glass shower and rainhead.  The best part of the hotel were the amenities: loved the rooftop bar with amazing views, spa and breakfast was superb. Excellent location on the docks with close by restaurants and bars.

We returned 5 days later foranother night stay and the staff remembered us and couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful.  We truly loved our stay at The Marker!!",5,2014,09,02
206,Great stay....,"I can't recall being so pleasantly surprised by exceptional service and welcome by any hotel other than the Marker; I had wanted to check this hotel out for my parents when they come to visit in October this year, so I got a great deal from one of the hotel price comparison sites, for an overnight stay in June this year.

It has a busy lobby, with bustling activity, especially since it is mainly a corporate hotel. Conferences and groups of foreign visitors congregate routinely. Despite the masses, the very professional and courteous reception staff, made eye contact while I was shyly making my way to the check in desk, and gave me a broad welcoming smile! That is half the battle won in the strife for perfect service, I think!

The check in was smooth an efficient, and because I was only staying the night, and after enquiring my purpose of picking the Marker, my lovely reception fella upgraded me to a room with a superb view.

Location-wise, it is a brisk 20 minute walk to get to O'Connell street, but the docklands renewal and pedestrian paths make it a pleasant one.  Then there is always the LUAS (light rail) across the Liffey only 5 mins stroll from the hotel which can bring one over to the west side of the city, north of the quays, stopping at Jervis centre(shopping), Kilmainham and Smithfield etc.

Breakfast at the hotel wasn't included in my room rate, but customers are given the choice of adding it on; if one does this the evening before, there is a discounted rate: ‚Ç¨15 a head, for buffet style tasty fare and organic yogurts and freshly squeezed juices. The waiter we have was fast! pleasant and very polite; the F&B manager that morning was on the shop floor, and stopped to chat with most of the customers, including myself.

The spa and pool are impressive, although a little small in size but pleasant enough if one uses the facilities during less busy times.

All in all, I can't wait for this October when I'll be able to treat my folks to this gem of a hotel....I just hope my friendly reception staff is still around!",5,2014,09,02
206,Top class!,"Great hotel with even better service. Enjoyed a very relaxing weekend. Perfect location for leisure and business, within easy walking distance of all major attractions. Roof top bar is a must with fabulous views over the city. Rooms and amenities top quality, bathroom very spacious with quality fixings and adjustable floor heating a great touch. All staff very friendly and helpful.",5,2014,09,01
206,Luxury at its best,"Comfortable, convient, stunning views of Dublin day and night. Wonderful spa and pool. The roof top bar alone is worth the stay. Staff are very attentive. Attention to detail was magnificent throughout our stay. Loved it",5,2014,09,01
206,"Professional hotel, and you pay for it","Spent the weekend here while attending a wedding. I had a fabulous room with a large bathtube and all sorts of conveiences,including an iron and ironing board. The staff was very helpful. We had lots of ironing to be done and they were fast and efficient. There is a great lap pool and my time in the spa was wonderful. Really a top-notch hotel. However, you do pay for the experience.",5,2014,09,01
206,Great Hotel,"The hotel is new, and have very friendly and attentive staff. The spa was great, and the breakfast was really nicely done with great options. Did not get the chance to see the rooftop terrace, but all in all a great one night stay.",5,2014,08,31
206,Where you must stay in Dublin,"I found The Marker Hotel on Tripadvisor. I loved the pictures of the hotel, but the reviews are what sold me; the hotel certainly lived up to its expectation. The rooftop bar is amazing, the pool is breathtaking and the rooms are enormous, by European standards. It is a 20 minute walk to the center of the city (some reviews said 10), however, this was no concern for us. We did spend a little in taxis but well worth it (typically a $10 taxi ride). If you have never been, Dublin is quite small (only 500 million) so you can be anywhere quickly. Also, there are posh bars and a quaint breakfast place across from the hotel, AND a brand new theater right next to hotel. No shows were active while we were there, but certainly look into this if you stay.The staff is AMAZING and they have a great concierge to help with all reservations. Hotel quality, amenities and a posh/modern hotel out weighed location for us. We couldn't have been more pleased.  A little tip, we went directly to The Marker Hotel website to make the reservation and it was slightly less than the usual travel websites and offered us a king-sized bed where all the travel websites said they were sold out and only offered two doubles.",5,2014,08,29
206,JUST GREAT -MY HOME WHEN IN DUBLIN,"Think my third/fourth  ?time stay was to be a fourth/fifth   but as my plans always change did not make fourth/fifth   to rush ""home"" to China on business -am Irish -live abroad so always nice to come home and to Dublin on route to my family home in Sligo 2/3 times per year meet my sister and family etc  -used to stay in the U2 place down the river which used to be fab -but then went down(after 2 bad stays enough! as I pay myself !!) -not sure now ??-then Merrion -very nice great location superb service -particularly concierge and door men  but a little worn in places and they did send me to an occupied room last time !-as I am travelling normally in Europe for at least a week usually from China have valuables and luggage so security important.
Found the Marker from reviews -really nice modern  Hotel -location so so -like a developing area in China so will be better in 2/3 years -still walking distance to O Connel Bridge but still really nice particularly in summer ,Hotel rooms superb-Dental Kit on request only though  in a 5 Star Hotel??-but this is Europe !1 ,staff great -finally got to visit the rooftop bar and entertain my sister ( last few times closed as winter or off period) -great place although chilly for me even in August coming from 35c China heat-Dublin 12C??  Overall a great Hotel -pool is superb ( visited last time ) really everyone helpful -just a great hassle proof place to stay after a 19 hour journey -definitely recommend and I am difficult (Manage one of the best Hotels in Asia)  but very down to earth  as all Irish people are -would say if you like Luxury and modern choose here , like Luxury and traditional choose the Merrion -for people who like a traditional Irish Breakfast -I was underwhelmed by Merrion( three times there)  -did not try The Marker yet -as had no time!-best  breakfast I have had in Dublin in terms of Traditional Irish at Hotels in my opinion was at Gresham food authentic although service so so but worth a try. Anyhow hope this review is helpful",5,2014,08,29
206,Excellent hotel for a weekend away,"We stayed here for 2 nights over the august bank holiday. The staff and very friendly and helpful, the rooms fairly big and nicely decorated with great bathrooms. The pool, sauna and steam room are worth a visit too. We ate one night in the bar because the brasserie was shut on the Sunday night, the food was good but a bit pricey perhaps. The rooftop bar is worth a visit if the weather is good enough.

There's a couple of nice restaurants in the area, we went to the Mourne seafood bar one evening, does great fish. You do need to book if you want a table but you can just turn up and sit at the bar. 

It's a good 15 minutes walk into the centre of Dublin but easily walkable. You can get a bus or the tram if you want to go to the other side of the city though. 

I'd definitely recommend The Marker for a short visit.",5,2014,08,29
206,"Outstanding design, quality and levels of service",The design and attention to detail make this a very comfortable and interesting hotel to stay in.  The staff are exceptional and will always help in anyway they can without being overbearing.  The hotel is striving to be first class leading small hotel and it shows through in all areas.  The spa facilities are first class.  The location in redeveloped docklands area is about 10 mins from the centre but is interesting and lively in itself and plenty of nearby restaurants.  Highly recommended and probably the best place town if you like design and quality.,5,2014,08,27
206,great hotel,"The hotel is not listed in the ‚ÄúLeading hotels of the World‚Äù directory for nothing.   The taxi drivers were impressed when I told them that I was stying at the Marker.  They told me that it was the newest and best hotel in Dublin.

Stayed at the Marker Hotel for three nights.  Everything in the hotel is AMAZING; millions must have been spent building the place.  The staff are really friendly and helpful as soon as you sit down someone comes up and asks someone comes up and asks if you would like a newspaper to read. 

The hotel has a fantastic 23-metre swimming pool and jacuzzi.

One thing really impressed me with the Marker is that they telephoned the day before to double check I was coming

As has been noted in previous reviews the views from the rooftop bar are amazing.  My only gripe about the rooftop bar is I got the impression that the staff thought, ‚Äúoh there is a block on his own we will ignore him‚Äù.  Having said that the metre D up there really did look after me.   Having said that the rest of the staff really looked after me. as well

As has been noted in other reviews the hotel is right next door to the Brod Grais theatre, so if you arrive early for the show you can just pop back to you room for a few minutes.

The reception even transferred my payment into my local currency so I did not have to pay foreign currency payment on my credit card bill. 

Will defiantly come back to the Marker when next in Dublin.",5,2014,08,26
206,Stylish & attentive staff,"Modern hotel in Dublin's newly developed south side next to the Bord Gais Energy Theatre and Grand Canal. The staff are excellent - very willing to assist and provide excellent service levels: reception, the spa staff, restaurant, room service - all were great.
Food is good, particularly the breakfast. The roof top bar is stylish, popular and serves great cocktails  - with lovely views of the city.
Rooms are nicely equipped, spacious thanks to good ceiling height, with the usual amenities - multi-channel TV, iPad dock, mini-bar etc.
The spa is great. A good sized pool which sensibly restricts kids swimming times so adults can chill / swim quietly in the evening. Our kids still had plenty of time to splash about.
Overall an excellent stay - highly recommended.",5,2014,08,26
206,Discovered by accident!,"What a find!  After our chosen hotel apparently overbooking and having to provide us with alternative accomodation during our trip to Dublin to visit friends, we were given an upgrade to The Marker at no cost to ourselves.  And very impressed we were too. This is a wonderful retreat in a fabulous location.  Our every requirement was met and superceeded and the staff could not do enough to help make us forget the earlier traumas of the days confusion. 

I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the charming docks area in Dublin although you may need an overdraft for the drinks bill at the end of your stay.",5,2014,08,26
206,Very disappointed,"I stayed for a night at the marker on the 24th August with my partner as a treat as we both live in the Dublin area. I arrived at 3.30 and after paying the room rate plus 50 euro incase we touched the minibar, was told my room wasn't available to check into however I could have a drink 'on them'. I was left sitting for 10 minutes before i was served a drink in the bar area. In the end I was sat alone for way over an hour seemingly forgotten about. It seemed as if a shift had switched over and they had forgot that their guests were waiting... the room was lovely and the bathroom gorgeous. When my boyfriend arrived he was very upset by how the check in was handled and made this clear which the hotel then offered us a bottle of wine. From then the whole experience was awkward they began to acknowledge him by name when we went through the atrium, as if service only mattered when you were annoyed. Then to add to the experience there was loud banging from 9 in the morning for an hour. The Hotel followed up with an apology email, but the whole experience was far from 5 star and was awkward, I have had better service in 3 stars where the staff are real people rather than robotic. I was so looking forward to trying the rooftop bar and the pool but didn't feel comfortable to do so. I wouldn't be back.",2,2014,08,26
206,real 5-star !,"Brand new hotel, modern design, large rooms, huge bathrooms, clean, excellent service by professional and very friendly staff.

The only negative is the location, which is beautiful - on the river - but still, it's about 20 minutes walk from downtown and the main shopping areas.",5,2014,08,26
206,Perfect Birthday Stat,"My boyfriend booked this hotel as a treat for my 30th birthday. The hotel is very new and from the moment we arrived the service was excellent. We were given two complementary glasses of champagne and a cake in our room which was a lovely touch. 

The rooms are spacious and extremely well appointed. Our bathroom had a large bath and separate shower. The spa is also fantastic. 

We went to the rooftop bar on our first night. We had to wait about ten minutes for a table but this was no problem and stops the bar becoming too crowded. It was with the wait and we had a lovely, if a bit expensive, evening up there. 

I cannot say enough good things about this hotel or it's staff. It is a bit out of the city centre and is about a 20 min walk to Temple Bar, Grafton St etc. 

Will hopefully be back soon!",5,2014,08,25
206,Brilliant modern hotel,Stayed here for two nights. Check in with Gary and his team was very welcoming. Our room was very clean and really lovely. The bathroom was class and the bed was very comfortable. We had cocktails on the roof top bar. The view is amazing. The service from all the staff is excellent. We had dinner on our first evening. Two courses for 25 euro each which was great value but also very delicious. Breakfast on both mornings was excellent. A great selection of everything. Roderick and Jose gave excellent service. Sandra and Gareth also went the extra mile when we arrived to welcome us. This was much appreciated. We walked into Dublin in roughly 20 minutes. We got a taxi back from Merrion Square which was 8 euros. Thank you The Marker hotel for a lovely stay. We will return again.,5,2014,08,25
206,one of the best,"nice location with best service recommend to visit the hotel, the breakfast was in very nice location , the room was provided as per our request, flower arrangement for free, the canal view is excellent.",5,2014,08,25
206,Superb!,"My wife and I stayed in the Marker Hotel over Christmas (2013). We had tickets to see Wicked in the Bord Gais Energy Theatre and so wanted a hotel nearby. The front doors of the hotel are literally a stone's throw from the theatre entrance so if you are seeing a show I recommend this hotel!

The hotel itself was amazing! Very modern and trendy and the room was amazing. We walked to O'Connell and Grafton street in about 30 mins so it has a nice location (tiny bit out from the main shopping areas but def walkable!). We had dinner in the hotel restaurant before the show which was lovely which we were able to book from our room.

Throughly recommend this hotel - really enjoyed our stay....thanks!",5,2014,08,24
206,Very good business hotel,"Very comfortable modern hotel in docklands area of Dublin. Very charming and helpful staff. Just across the river from conference centre, pleasant surroundings but more than half an hour walk from true city centre/tourist attractions. Would recommend for business purposes as opposed to tourism. If the purpose of a trip is to attend a conference, this hotel is perfect.",4,2014,08,24
206,Highly recommend,This is a new hotel and well maintained. The staff were friendly and helpful. Our flight arrived early and they kindly stored our luggage and took it to our room when it became available. Rooms are spacious by European standards and the beds comfortable. It was quiet and we slept well. The Grand Canal Square in front of the hotel with gardens and the architecturally interesting Bord G√°is Energy Theatre is stunning particularly when the red glowing angled light sticks reflect in the canal waters. It is easy to access taxis and the Dublin bus (including the Hop on Hop off tour buses) from this location or it is a brisk 20 minute walk to city centre. There are food markets across the courtyard or up the street should you like to pick up a quick simple meal or the hotel has fine dining facilities. We were very pleased with our choice to stay here and would do so again.,5,2014,08,22
206,Marker hotel ,"Come to Dublin every month on business, by far the best hotel I've stayed in this year 

Clean modern rooms, friendly staff and nice area down by the river

Book early for the rooftop bar as places fill up quickly and tables are limited 

If you want the best and can get a deal on price this is it ",5,2014,08,21
206,Brilliant Stay!,"Stayed here recently, first time in this Hotel and this part of Dublin.
Lovely staff, fantastic room and great area.
What a nice new find in Dublin, both the Hotel and the area.
Highly recommend, from start to finish.
clean, bright comfortable, friendly, loads of athmosphere, 
Pleasant surprise.",5,2014,08,20
206,Beautiful Hotel - My Favorite,"I've stayed here a couple of times and never tire of the place. The staff are excellent, the rooms are gorgeous and the food is top of the range.
The roof top bar is a must visit.
The breakfast is the best i have come across in a long time and must be sampled.",5,2014,08,20
206,Enjoyable stay and funky room!,"Stayed here for one night for a midweek break in July.  Lovely hotel and very courteous staff.  Did not enjoy the meal we had in the restaurant on the evening we stayed, it was expensive and very small portions.  I had the spatchcock chicken which was more bone that meat.  Staff in the restaurant were polite but the manager there on the night we ate there was so serious he sour any good humour.  In the upside rooms were lovely and very comfy! Love the decor in the halls leading to the bedroom,dark with minimal lighting and plush carpet.  Only thing about the room that is a negative is that the windows cannot be opened.  I also enjoyed a beautiful relaxing spa treatment in the hotel's spa,I had a facial,customised facial.  Therapist was so friendly and thoroughly enjoyed my facial! Overall really enjoyed my stay at The Marker! Only downside was the dining experience üòû",5,2014,08,19
206,FANTASTIC MODERN HOTEL,"We recently stayed at this hotel and must say we were very impressed. The reception we received was second to none, very professional yet extremely friendly approach. Our rooms were very big and extremely comfortable. The suite was huge with all amenities you may need. We would highly recommend staying at this hotel not only for its location, staff and service but also for its luxurious feel. We will definitely be back!!!!",5,2014,08,19
206,Mark this spot!,"We recently spent three nights at the Marker and thoroughly enjoyed our time there.  We arrived before check-in time after a long trip from Canada.  The staff did everything they could to get us into our room as soon as possible, and offered use of other hotel facilities while we waited.  The room was very spacious, with a beautiful big bathroom.  The servicing of the room was top notch, and we appreciated the nightly turn-down service.  The rest of the hotel is lovely and modern, and the rooftop bar has great views.  We also used the pool and jacuzzi after a long day of walking and loved the subdued lighting and great jets in the spa.  We had room service breakfast twice, and it was very good, and professionally presented at the exact time we requested.  
Location was very good - easy stroll to centre core, but quiet at night.  Also easy walk to the DART to catch the train for day trip outside the city.  Not cheap, but worth the splurge.",5,2014,08,18
206,10 out of 10,"arrived here for me and my partners anniversary after wanting to stay here since it opened.service is top class,rooftop bar had amazing views of dublin and was nice to have  a drink or two.recieved an upgrade to a deluxe room and was not dissapointed rooms are huge and very modern.went into the city centre for dinner and drinks you will need to get a taxi as it is a 20min walk to city centre.the swimming pool is a must to relax in before a night out.i was very happy with everything and service was phenomenol.will definately stay here again but only on special occasions as lunch,parking and bed and breakfast cost 350 for 1 night but brilliant hotel",5,2014,08,17
206,Absolutely Outstanding!!,"I have just returned from a 2 night stay at this fantastic hotel where we were getting married in the nearby Registry Office.I cannot begin to explain how the staff of this hotel made my stay the most amazing experience of my life,something I will treasure.From the time we arrived we were treated to the best of everything.The Staff on arrival were courteous,polite and unbelievably pleasant.Our room was outstanding!On the morning of the wedding they could not have done enough for us and that continued on throughout our stay.The location of this hotel is spectacular and I know our photos will reflect that.We cannot thank the staff and management of this hotel enough for making our day so memorable and we will definitely be returning to stay again in the near future.The Best Hotel in Dublin and it deserves all of its 5 stars!!Denise...",5,2014,08,17
206,Sophisticated but not pretentious,"A very stylish hotel with excellent housekeeping and friendly, professional staff.  Non residents enjoyed lunchtime drinks and snacks in the lounge / lobby, creating a happy, sociable atmosphere.  We stayed in a deluxe room and the bathroom was very impressive.  Breakfast was delicious and the standard checkout time of midday was a real bonus.",5,2014,08,16
206,Excellent hotel,"Spent eight days here recently and was overwhelmed with the quality of the service and facilities.  Everything was first class.  The roof top bar is a great place to have a drink and watch the sun go down (weather permitting).  Had dinner one night in the restaurant - we both had lobster and it was delicious.  The front desk personnel were helpful, knowledgeable, professional and polite.  We loved the hotel and will definitely stay there again.",5,2014,08,16
206,Marker Hotel = on the mark!,"What a wonderful hotel. We had room 202 overlooking the canal and the Energy Theater. A bit off the beaten path, which meant fairly quiet at night. This is a mixed-use area, so there are offices, restaurants/caf√©s, apartments, and some retail all mixed together. Had we stayed in the heart of downtown I suspect there would have been lots of noise from traffic and people. Service here was excellent, all staff we encountered were peasant and courteous. We had drinks/snacks on the rooftop and that was lovely. We had to wait a bit to get a table but it was well worth it, we enjoyed the view and the meal. Laundry service was same day and I thought reasonably priced for a hotel of this caliber. We stayed here about a week and our time here could not have been better. Definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2014,08,15
206,"One word ""perfect""","My partner booked a 4 night stay @ the Marker for my birthday. From the minute we stepped in the hotel we were not disapointed. Each and every one of the staff were friendly and helpful and could not do enough for you. (sorry im terrible with names and too many to mention) We checked in and were shown to our room. Moments later there was a knock on ther door, a waiter with glasses of champagne for my birthday! later in the day we arrived back to find cake with ""happy birthday"" wrote in chocolate on the plate. 
The room was spotless, the bathroom was huge, great hairdryer so need to take your own and the iron was better than the one i have at home. The wifi was great as really quick. Only negative is there could have been more storage space. 
The breakfast were great with a huge variety from cerials to cheese and hams to full cooked breakfast. 
We spent Friday night on the roof top terrace which is a must!! Its a great place to chilled with cocktails and the views are great. My partner proposed while we were up there which was all pre planned with the staff who did a great job of keeping it quiet.
Can not praise the hotal and staff enough, We will deffinatley be going back for a second vist.

Just want to thank the hotel for the most memorable weekend ever!!! Thank you so much xxx",5,2014,08,14
206,Awesome Staff - Great Hotel,"6 Stars to the staff of the Marker Hotel.  Not only are they friendly but helpful beyond expectations.  This is a very nice hotel...heated floors in the bathroom, deep soak tub, beds are among the most comfortable we have ever had in a hotel and the environment is very friendly.  It is a little out of the way for the night life...but well worth staying at.  It is within short walking distance of every major tech company.  But best of all are the Staff...shout outs to Robert, Stephan and Andrea for making our stay excellent.",5,2014,08,14
206,Great and stylish place,"Really great hotel, located in the docks. A little far to walk to the city centre if you want to go there, but the dockside area is great too. Modern, and stylish place, great staff and facilities. Worth a stay if you can afford it :-)
Breakfast is not included",5,2014,08,13
206,Fantastic stay,"My husband and I (both in our 30's) recently stayed at the Marker from August 5th-7th while in Dublin. From start to finish the Marker staff went out of their way to make our stay memorable. We are members of the Leading Hotels of the World, and I must say - this hotel sets a new standard. The reservation team went out of their way to make sure our booking process was seamless and added a few extra touches that made our stay something special. The concierge, front staff, breakfast staff and maid service all contributed to an extremely comfortable stay and overall fabulous experience. In terms of location, it's about a 15-20 minute walk along the waterfront to Temple Bar...which in my opinion was just right. We enjoyed exploring the city during the day and relaxing on the rooftop bar in the evening before dinner. We also received lovely follow-up from the Guest Relations Manager after our departure, to ensure our stay met our standards. All in all, it's one of the best hotel experiences we have had. Cheers to the people at the Marker. If they can maintain this standard, they will be a tough act for any other hotel in Dublin to beat.",5,2014,08,12
206,Fabulous hotel,"Stunning hotel with fantastic staff available to assist whenever possible. Fully enjoyed all of my stay here and couldn't fault the hotel, the suite or the spa. 
A must is the roof top bar stunning views great staff great service fantastic cocktails. ",5,2014,08,10
206,Absolutely amazing every time,"We just spent another fantastic weekend at the Marker, nothing has changed and nor would you want it to, you can't improve on perfection. This hotel sets the standards by which all hotels should be judged, the staff are all super friendly and do everything possible to make your stay enjoyable. The rooms are spotlessly clean and modern, the spa is the best in Ireland and one of the best I've been to worldwide and the food is superb. Add to all of this the wonderful rooftop terrace bar with views all over Dublin and what you get is pure gold. This hotel is the best in Ireland bar none and I'm pretty sure it will be number one on trip advisor very soon since it's only opened just over a year ago. Book the Marker and I can promise you won't be disappointed. ",5,2014,08,10
206,A nice treat for a weekend in Dublin,"Great location, although a bit out of town. Surrounded by nice bars and restaurants and only 10 mins walk from the main sites.

Rooftop bar is lovely, although they may ask for a reservation, so worth planning ahead.

Rooms are nice furnished and laid out, although wardrobe space is a bit limited.  Spa is a good space to relax for a while, with a decent sized pool and jacuzzi/sauna etc.",4,2014,08,09
206,Very Impressed,"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel.  I would recommend to ring in advance to book the valet parking as it could cost ‚Ç¨30.  The staff really make this hotel.  They are all so friendly.  We has a room on the third floor, nice view, beautiful bathroom with great shower.  The turn down service was lovely as we were rushing out for a meal and when we came back the room was cleaned again, with slippers left out and chocolates, a lovely touch.  The breakfast was very good, plenty of variety.  My husband said the Irish breakfast was great, the bacon was very fresh as he finds in most hotels it isn't always the case.  They even had flaxseed.  We did get to see the rooftop bar.  The views are fantastic.  It can get quiet busy later on I. The evening and sometimes can be closed for private functions.  Maybe check with the hotel beforehand if you want to see the rooftop bar.  It was our anniversary, lovely little pastry in room wishing us a happy anniversary.  It is a good 15/20 minute walk into the city but you can get the luas also.  There is a spar close by and also another grocery shop straight across the road from the hotel.  They do a nice selection of wine and also wine from the chiller. When we were leaving 2 bottles of water left in the car for us.  Really enjoyed our stay.",5,2014,08,09
206,"Great hotel, a little off the beaten path.","I spent 4 nights at this stylish and very comfortable hotel.  The staff was friendly, professional and ready to assist at any time.  Another bonus is that the size of my room was quite large, in comparison to most of the hotels I've stayed at in Europe.  The hotel is located in the Docklands area of town, about a 20 minute walk from the Trinity University/tourist area.  This is both a good and a bad thing depending on the nature of your visit.  The positive is that the area is very quiet, has great views of the river and docks,and you're much more likely to strike up a conversation with a local Dubliner.  The negative, for me, was that I often took taxis (about 6-7 Euro each way) to get to the Trinity College area to catch tours just because I didn't feel like always walking the longer distance.  If I had to do again, I likely would have stayed somewhere a bit closer to tourist area, but I can't say enough good things about the Marker.",5,2014,08,08
206,Great Hotel,"Very Nice new area, beautiful and modern. Well connected to Temple Bar and Dublin City Center. I definitely recommend it. There is a lovely restaurant at the other side of the canal, were we ate delicious seafood. Very well connected to Dublin Airport as well. Loved it. Great view from the terrace.",5,2014,08,08
206,As good as it looks in the photos!,"One of the newest hotels in Dublin... really cool architecture, rooms very spacious, attentive staff. Received a free upgrade. Gym and spa facilities top notch. Food really good, although a little pricey. Close to good restaurants and bars. Will be returning.",5,2014,08,08
206,very good 5 star chic hotel,"stylish and comfortable hotel and the best service we have ever experienced. a lot of thanks to the shift manager UNNI for his great attitude helping us. the pool, gym and spa area are modern and efficient. we really enjoyed our staying very much
to improve : lack of closet space in the room. the food variety and quality in the bars. needed more light for shaving in the bathroom.",5,2014,08,08
206,"Fabulous place to stay when exploring Dublin, truly relaxing.","We stayed here for a 3 day break in August. All aspects of our stay were top notch. All staff from the time of our arrival to when we left were friendly, helpful and professional. The rooftop bar was a real treat, a lovely way to end the day. The views from rooms at the front of the hotel are great watching people kayaking in the quay, there is a good choice of cafe's eateries nearby if you choose to stay local (the food at the hotel was great too). The room was spacious, immaculately clean and the bed was so comfy we stept really well each night.  We even found we were the only people in the pool/Jacuzzi/steam and sauna area which is well worth a visit. After many years of staying in hotels on a regular basis we have very high expectations and The Marker certainly is one of the few places we have stayed that met them 100%",5,2014,08,06
206,Not great,"I booked my Mum, sister and I into the hotel as a treat. The rooms are beautiful but I have to say I was very disappointed in the customer service although I had hoped this was perhaps due to a few 'new opening' hitches

We went for dinner and when we arrived back we were not allowed to go on the rooftop as it was at full capacity. The person was quite rude and did not seem to care that my family were staying in the hotel. We sat at the bar and did not get to the rooftop. Upon leaving we had wanted to try the cronuts, which were also sold out. Not to mention the queue in check out. While the hotel was new and clean it lacked customer service and friendliness. 

I recently emailed about booking a table for 2 on the rooftop for myself and partner, to be told they only reserve for parties of 10 or above. I explained what had happened last time but still customer service is lacking here.",2,2014,08,06
206,Luxury hotel lives up to its name,"The Marker was everything we wanted it to be. Comfortable with friendly, knowledgable staff. It was in ideal situation for us. We enjoyed the rooftop terrace, seating area at the front as we had lovely weather. Breakfast was excellent and room had all the little touches that set a good hotel apart from the others. Even a Cafetiere for coffee in the room. We would definitely stay here again.  Nowhere is perfect but the odd niggle was soon forgotten in the overall experience.",4,2014,08,05
206,Fabulous,"Stayed here for 2 nights in May. First of all the decor was beautiful, all the staff where lovely. The food was brilliant and to too it off the bed was incredible. The marker is the only place to stay in Dublin when visiting. The rooftop terrace is out if this world.",5,2014,08,02
206,First class hotel. Worth every star.,"This is a fantastic hotel. I had last minute changes to my reservation and had to bring my 10 month old and mother. They were so accommodating.  Everyone we encountered from start to finish were genuine, warm and very professional. The lobby, the lift, the room, the bathroom and the pool are the perfect size. It might sound strange mentioning this but in Ireland everything tends to be awkward in size in  
hotels. The breakfast was absolutely delicious, really well organized and the staff were lovely. They have meats, cheeses, pastries, the usual eggs and sausages. A wide variety to cater to everyone. Really well presented. The staff were very attentive and the table was set lovely.My only 
regret is that we didn't have dinner in the hotel. We went downtown which was a disaster. But we will know 
better next time. I highly recommend your hotel. Thank you for a memorable stay and I will be back! ",5,2014,08,02
206,Up on the roof. ,"I had visited this hotel for a few drinks while on a stag do in January and thought it was cool. Had heard about the roof top bar but didn't get a chance to go up on that occasion. We did however, on our most recent trip to Dublin. We were lucky with the weather, although slightly overcast, it was very warm and the sun broke out a good few times, from the roof bar the views around Dublin are grand, I can see the attraction and why there is always a waiting list to get in on the great days!! We had a bottle of champagne and white wine along with a few beers and I found the pricing very reasonable. A great place to spend a sunny afternoon. ",5,2014,08,02
206,"Lovely, modern and chic hotel in Dublin","Took two rooms on a family trip to Dublin and picked Marker Hotel as it's close to the theatre to see 'Dirty Dancing'.
Friendly welcome from reception and valet parking. Had lovely rooms with great views over Grand Canal Square and Harbour, excellent, friendly service, spectacular rooftop bar for drinks (hotel guests don't need to wait in line as this is a very popular local venue to meet), lovely pre-theatre two course meal and 30 second walk to theatre, which is itself a magnificent building.
Excellent breakfast in really distinctively designed restaurant, again lovely, helpful staff.
Overall, lovely experience, expensive but well worth it.",5,2014,08,01
206,"Excellent hotel, nice location","Stayed here for just one night when I was in Dublin for business.  Booked at the last minute.  I arrived early having taken the red eye, and my room wasn't ready.  I elected to pay more for a better room which was ready, and was put in a corner suite.  Very nice room, floor to ceiling windows, spacious bathroom,etc.  The hotel is located conveniently in a recently-revamped part of Dublin which seemed very lively.  Hotel staff were helpful, and I will stay here again next time I am in Dublin.",5,2014,08,01
206,Roof Top Bar 'Closed for Private Function' - Not good enough!,"Arrived and was greeted politely by staff. Check in was smooth and friendly. 

The room itself was clean, a good size and nicely presented. I have no complaints regarding the room or service received as everything in that regard was very good. We ordered room service breakfast and it was delivered exactly on time.

The wifi worked well (very important), it was able to stream at a decent rate and you even have a personal 'wifi bubble' that you can pair into and stream content to your tv which is a nice feature. However, it can't stream things purchased via an iTunes account and stored on your phone / iPad etc.

The breakfast was decent, the sort of breakfast you would expect from a large hotel - the continental selection and then the usual bacon, scrambled egg, sausages etc.. I've had better and I've had worse but it was fine overall.

The big failing now of the hotel which was the main reason we booked the place and also the reason we will probably never return to it. On asking the girl at reception for directions to the roof top bar, she informed us it was closed due to a 'private function' and would remain like this for the next 4 days. This spoiled the hotel for us as it is the hotels selling feature that distinguishes it from others. Had we have know this we would have just booked into the Gibson hotel which is almost half the price and is served directly by the Luas line making it very easy and cheap to nip and out of city centre. The Gibson offers rooms which are just as nice and from memory we even have a small balcony you can step out on in the Gibson.

Anyway the one key feature which would make the hotel feel special is quite often closed (I've since found out), and because of this there is no reason why I could recommend anyone choose this hotel over the Gibson - which also offers free parking. 

Even the Westbury which is a bit more expensive again but offers location that is just a few steps away from Grafton Street would be a better option for those travelling for pleasure.",3,2014,08,01
206,Best hotel ever,"We stay 3 nights there. What a wonderful stay. Everything is just perfect, staff, room, location... I want the same comfort at home !!! I love the deep blue carpet, the bed so comfy, the marble bathroom, very modern and zen at the same time.",5,2014,07,31
206,Best view in dublin,"First impressions are great, your car is taken care of and the front desk staff are great and efficient, we booked a suite which shouldn‚Äôt be called a suite as it only consists of one room and isn‚Äôt that large for a suite, we queried this and were upgraded to a full suite which was wonderful. The Hotel itself is spotless and the food is very good, we had the pre theatre meal which was great value for the quality, the down stairs bar is ok however very open. The roof top bar is a must visit and has one of the best views in Dublin. Worth booking though as it gets busy. The pool and sauna and steam room are amazing. This is a 5* hotel however don‚Äôt bother paying extra for a corner suite which is basically a large room.",5,2014,07,31
206,Ultra modern hotel,"Stayed in the Marker for one night. Although the hotel is expensive you get what you pay for, excellent service for staff, from the doorman, valet parking, reception and bar staff. The hotel itself is very modern. The room was very clean with fully stocked mini bar and very comfy beds, bathroom is massive and loved the shower. The hotel also gave us a welcome platter with delicious mini desserts, very nice touch. Turndown service also with chocolates on pillow.  The location itself is about a 20min walk from temple bar area.  Only drawback is that we didn't get to visit the rooftop bar as it closes at 11, but had a delicious cocktail in bar instead.",5,2014,07,30
206,When in Dublin,"My friend and I stayed at this hotel and loved it.  The service was very friendly and the room was super nice and comfortable. The bathroom was very clean and posh. The concierge was so very helpful. The hotel has a really nice rooftop for drinks and light food. 

They really go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. Their breakfast buffet was excellent and really like the coffee.  The spa was gorgeous!  Would definitely stay here again when in Dublin.",5,2014,07,29
206,"Great Staff, Not so Great Value","We chose to stay at the Marker for a 2 night stay during July 14 due to it's location, star rating & reviews. Transfers from the airport take around 15 minutes & cost approximately ‚Ç¨20 by taxi. First impressions of the hotel were good. Modern looking, good location, popular.

Upon arrival we were greeted at the taxi by an immaculately dressed friendly gent who took our bags into the reception area where the reception team were friendly, efficient & helpful. We opted to pay for our 2 night stay in full upon arrival so were a bit surprised that we were also expected to pay a deposit of ‚Ç¨50 per person, per night on top. 

The lobby of the hotel is open planned with a lounge bar & reception area leading to the bistro dinning area. The decor is very modern, light & had a pleasant atmosphere.

Our room was classified as a deluxe double (Room 208) & was well appointed, clean & views to the front overlooking the canal & theatre. Our room had a safe, iron & board, slippers, dressing gowns, Tea & Coffee making facilities & a mini bar. The bed itself was large & comfortable, the bathroom had a large shower & bath & had the usual toiletries available.

A nice surprise when returning to the room in the evening was a pair of slippers either side of the bed on a towel with good night written on along with the chocolates on the pillow. 

Breakfast consisted of a large choice of cereals, yoghurts, fresh fruit, sausage, bacon, black pudding, mushrooms, tomato & scrambled eggs served buffet style. Tea, Coffee, Orange Juice & toast were brought to the table. All food was well presented & appetising, the only complaint was that the scrambled eggs were cold, admittedly difficult to keep warm for long on a buffet. 

The lobby bar was busy, especially if the theatre across the street is emptying, had a good atmosphere, choice of beverages was good, staff were friendly & prices reasonable for a hotel. Complementary olives & nuts were provided at the table. A nice outside seating / smoking area also had full table service, again busy & seats at a premium. There is a roof top bar however due to a private party we were not allowed access so cannot comment.

The hotel also has a well equipped gym, pool & spa area, sadly not used during this visit. Evening meals were taken outside of the hotel so cannot comment on food.

Departure was once again efficient, the deposit refunded & a ‚Ç¨3 mini bar charged in error refunded without question & taxi booked.

Overall the hotel was very clean with polite, efficient & friendly staff. It is situated in a good location within walking distance of the main landmarks of Dublin. Free maps of the main streets were available from reception. I would recommend this hotel although cheaper hotels have better locations & facilities, especially if on a budget. The taxi driver back to the airport said that we chose a nice hotel, but probably the most expensive in Dublin. I agree",4,2014,07,29
206,Excellent hotel,"I was in Dublin for business and stayed at the Marker Hotel for ten days. I enjoyed my stay very much. The hotel is very modern, beautifully decorated and with a very pleasant atmosphere. The staff is very welcoming, friendly and efficient. 
The hotel is situated in the new Docklands area which is at a convenient 15 minute walking distance from the centre. I did not try the hotel restaurant in the evening, as there are many good restaurants very close to the hotel and some evenings I simply preferred to spend time in the city centre. But I did enjoy the breakfast very much and also had the opportunity to order food from the bar one day at lunch when I did not have time to go out for a meal. The waiter was very kind and brought my order to the conference room where I was working.
And as for the conference rooms and business centre, they are very well equipped. The event manager and the staff are very professional and attentive to all request and they are very good at finding solutions to all kinds of problems. And not even once did I see any irritation when I asked to adjust the light, or the air con in the conference rooms. And I did that several times, as the participants at my meeting could not agree on the right temperature etc, in the room. The staff seem to be extremely patient!
And now to the rooms. I cannot say anything negative. Just like the rest of the hotel, they are beautifully decorated and very clean. Spacious bathroom and very comfortable bed. What else can one ask for? I used the laundry service and all items came back very quickly and perfectly ironed. The staff at the reception are very helpful and can advise you if you would need any tips on where to go for a run in the area, the best restaurant, or where to go shopping etc.
I would love to return to the Marker Hotel for a romantic weekend. And if I do, then I will definitely order their Cronuts! They are exceptional.",5,2014,07,27
206,21 century quality in great old city,"Just had one night there with my wife.
 Everything was excellent.
The service, the room, the atmosphere.
enjoyed the lobby bar - great for people watching.
Although thoroughly modern there was still a great traditional Irish breakfast with the fantastic sausages that we in the 'diaspora' crave.
we got there too late to enjoy the rooftop bar but will get that right next time.
One thing, I actually prefer a location nearer town center.",5,2014,07,24
206,Excellent drinks venue,"We were recently at a show close by and went to Marker for post show drinks. Such a lovely hotel and really suitable for girls night out. Excellent staff who are very efficient.

So good, we are booked for dinner this weekend. Can't wait!! ",5,2014,07,23
206,Fantastic hotel with wonderful attentive staff !!,"We stayed at this hotel on Sunday to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  When we arrived the staff were straight over took our baggage and helped us get checked in.  We had the le drunch which was fab best cod & chips with minted mushy peas ever !!  We both received a complimentary glass of peach Bellini to celebrate our anniversary on behave of the staff and when our desert came out there was a happy anniversary message written in chocolate.  Throughout our stay the staff were friendly and attentive at all times and this was all staff not just a few ! The hotel is modern, luxiourious and immaculately clean.  We both enjoyed a gorgeous spa treatment and the use of the swimming pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi.  An absolutely gorgeous hotel, with great staff, wish we were still there and will deff be back !!",5,2014,07,23
206,Lovely lunch! ,"I had a business lunch here and was very impressed. Food very good, seating area is spacious and well organised. My business colleague were also impressed and I would definitely go back. 

Only negative thing I would say is they were a bit stretched on staff as we could not get anyone's attention to pay the bill and had to go up to the bar to pay it.  ",4,2014,07,22
206,Amazing. I love it. ,"Literally the nicest hotel I've stayed in. Such a treat. Utter coolness. Staff all so eager to help and ensure that your stay is all that you want it to be. Service was excellent. Couldn't be faulted. All guests are treated extremely well. Breakfast and le drunch were fabulous, dj in the brassiere was ultra cool. Rooms gorgeous, ceiling to floor windows with fab views. Rooftop bar was unfortunately closed for a private event the days that we were there but after asking at reception it was no problem for us to be shown around the next morning. I can't wait to return.   ",5,2014,07,22
206,5 Star all the way,"From the moment we arrived we knew this was something special. We handed over our car keys to the valet service and were whisked through to reception and before we knew it we were relaxing in a beautiful double room. Everything about this hotel was 5Star, the room, the decor, the breakfast, the staff and the impressive spa. Dublin's a great place to visit and our stay was definitely enhanced by staying at this wonderful hotel.",5,2014,07,21
206,Modern Hotel That Goes The Extra Mile,"Located at the new Docklands area, this hotel is a perfect stop for theatre (right next to Bord Gais) and has a bunch of new restaurants and shops around it.  There is bus transportation close by but you can walk to Temple Bar and places downtown in 15-20 minutes.  Rooms were very quiet and the staff was friendly and helpful.  Beautifully done gym and pool area (has a steam and dry sauna).  We didn't get to try the rooftop bar but that always looked like a highlight.  Price for the room for what we got was more than reasonable.  Highly recommend.",5,2014,07,20
206,Restaurant review.,We have eaten the bar food a few times before going to the nearby theatre and it is generally excellent. This is the first we have eaten in the restaurant. It was a deal so not sure if the price we paid reflects the usual bill. The food was just fantastic. It was as good as the food we had recently in a Michelin star restaurant. The chef is Garret Mullins. The restaurant was packed and he managed to produce some very high quality food for a lot of people. On top of that the service and staff were very good and attentive. I would recommend this restaurant. ,5,2014,07,20
206,My First Hotel Review!,"Went there to celebrate a special occasion with my wife and go to the theatre next door. I have to say that everyone that i encountered was so friendly and helpfull and they couldnt do enough for you. The staff remembered our names and wished us a happy anniversary wherever we went, vert impressive considering that it seemed they were pretty busy while i was there.
  My wife already hinted that she wants to be brought back there again and to be honest, i cant wait to go back either!",5,2014,07,20
206,Great hotel,"Stayed here while visiting Dublin with work. Wow what a hotel! Staff were so attentive, room was beautiful-large and spacious and so modern. Location was just what we needed-no time to explore but close to our offices. Breakfast was high quality and lots of choice. The rooftop bar was stunning-made for a great drinks reception. Overall a perfect stay, would love to return!",5,2014,07,20
206,Fantastic hotel for girls getaway,"We stayed in this this hotel as part of a girls getaway in Dublin. Everything about the hotel is wonderful, the staff are extremely helpful and accommodating. The rooms are very well appointed with clean and modern decor and lovely views over the city. The breakfast is absolutely magnificent with a range of buffet and al a carte options. The lobby which leads out to a small street terrace is a relaxing place to meet friends and enjoy a drink. The jewel in the Crown is the roof top bar which has breathtaking views over the Dublin Mountains and onto Dublin Bay and is the perfect place for afternoon drinks. The hotel is only a scenic 15 minute walk along the River Liffey from Connolly Station Luas stop so it makes it a good base to explore the city and of course it is right on the steps of the Grand Canal Theatre which makes it a great place to catch a show. There is a good range of dining options on the concourse as well. I will definitely stay again.",5,2014,07,20
206,Nice hotel with a couple of small issues,"Stayed for three nights, lovely and modern with lovely rooms and big bathrooms. Friendly and efficient staff. Only disappointed that the rooftop bar was shut to residents for two out of the three nights we were there due to private functions. Also if you use the car park behind they recommend valet parking as it costs 20 euros instead of 30. But when i checked out they tried to charge me 100 euros for five parking charges despite only staying there three nights. But this was corrected without a fuss.",4,2014,07,19
206,Cant wait to go back.,"Me and Mrs Burns (or Mrs Purdie as she still refers to herself)  visited the Marker for a weekend in Dublin. We have stayed in quite a few 5 star hotels as we consider ourselves better than the commoner people so don't like to mix with them. As they say in Made in Chelsea , ""rah rah... blah blah rah"" or something like that although I don't actually watch it as it is truely awful but my wife does, which i think is the real reason why i have to keep shelling out for these 5 star sleep overs. I'm sure she thinks that 5 star hotels are all going to be full of young hip and beautiful people just like Made in Chelsea , but they really aren't. They are always full of a lot of old people blowing their children's inheritance before they keel over. At least leave enough to pay for the wooden box i say. My wife was very pleased to see lots of the young and beautiful in the uber trendy Marker. I was also pleased to see the young and beautiful hen party.. If you're reading this Claire none are as beautiful as you of course.. Seriously.. I mean it..  (i hope you believe that or I'm in serious trouble when i get home).

On checking in they have a really lively vibrant open plan lobby. It runs the full front of the hotel and has a restaurant at one side , a cocktail bar at the other and reception in the middle. It's a great spot to sit and people watch and the local girl checking me in on arrival was very friendly.  I believe it was also her first day. Well done her. 

We had a superior room just in case any 3 star regulars got lost on the internet and mistakenly booked a standard room in here so we had to make sure we as were far away from them as possible. Of course the presidential suite would have been further away , but that wasn't possible on our chosen weekend due to a funding error that my bank account has. The rooms was great with some nice mini bar treats which had clearly been thought about. There is a good sized bath were i retired too with some yummy salted caramel chocolate from that mini bar. I've got a thing for baths and incidentally asked my wife out on our first date from a bath. Don't worry, its fine! It was just a phone call. I wasn't in her bath or anything weird. Ahem...The room appears a little sparse at first , but everything is just well hidden behind lots of drawers and compartments so the room looks super tidy. It's kind of wasted on us as we had it looking like a Mumbai slum in under 30 minutes by the time we had been through every drawer, ironed some outfits, had a few drinks,put on make up (not me obviously), and got melted chocolate caramel down the bath... Thankfully when we went out that night the hotel did a wonderful job of returning the room to its clinical look. I really don't know how they got that caramel off the bath though. It was welded on and looked like poo. I hope they didn't think i did one in the bath. That said there was no charge for the Salted Chocolate caramel so who knows?

Onto the facilities. We went to the roof top bar on the first night. It was raining so they let us stand in the enclosed section which is really nice although it wasn't set up with any tables or chairs which were all outside. I didn't mind standing but when we went back later they had it well stocked with tables chairs etc. Im not sure where they were hiding those tables and chairs at 7pm on a Friday night and still don't know why they were. One tip is to head up early to that bar. It can get full quickly but its really worth it as their cocktails are excellent and i know this because I'm sure we tried them all from what i remember . We must have as we gladly spent a small fortune in the roof top bar and went back for more the next night.
The spa is really nice. I do like a spa , which is not the most manly thing i know , but a nice relax and a read are among my favorite things. The Spa in the Marker was excellent. The pool is really stunning and its quite quiet for such a buzzing hotel. One improvement they could make is to move it all closer to the lift. It has a very long corridor to walk down before you actually reach the the spa which seemed like i was crossing the Sahara after suffering a day shopping with Mrs Burns (Purdie) who went to every shop in Dublin to find a top that some random girl was wearing in the lobby the night before. We walked 6 miles that day..   
To the person who gave 1 star to the marker and said the Steam room smelt of Menthol to mask the smell of sweaty feet , have you heard of aromatherapy? Seriously... Some people..

Breakfast was excellent but a little steep asking for ‚Ç¨15 for a buffet (‚Ç¨20 if you don't pre-book) and if you do want anything cooked fresh to order which many hotels will do for free there are lots of expensive extra charges...Eg ‚Ç¨6 extra for pancakes. So if you wanted pancakes and coffee at breakfast it could cost you ‚Ç¨26...Maybe you should have the pancakes in your room, or somewhere else entirely?

Location wise its about a 15 minute walk to O'Connell street along the river. Its a nice walk and the hotel is just close enough to be central. Its built in a newly developed area of Dublin which looks to be very up an coming. We tried the Mourne Seafood bar across from the hotel and it is excellent.

All in all we loved the Marker and cant wait to go back. I give it 5 Stars all the way. I cannot see how anyone from planet earth can give this hotel a 1* rating unless they are doing anything but venting anger about not knowing how to work the air conditioning which Mrs Burns (Purdie) who is a technical moron figured out all by herself. Well done Mrs Burns (Purdie) and well done to the Marker for a great hotel.",5,2014,07,19
206,Weekend Break In Dublin,"Just back from an amazing weekend in Dublin with my boyfriend. This hotel is incredible.. Not stayed in one of this class in a long time. Nothing was too much hassle and the attention to detail is incredible. Worth every penny! We booked to go to Dublin to go see dirty dancing which was playing in bord gais energy theatre, and out of sheer coincedence was next door to the hotel! So all in all was the best weekend break I've had in a long time, and majority of this was due to amazing marker hotel!! Xx",5,2014,07,18
206,Bollinger Tasting and 5 course meal,"Enjoyed an unforgettable night which started with champagne cocktails on the roof terrace accompanied by the nicest smoked salmon I have ever tasted! Beautiful balmy evening. Meal and service superb! Chicken & foie gras terrine, lobster ravioli, champagne & elderflower sorbet, wild turbot, strawberry & lemon curd meringue with basil ice-cream. Each course carefully chosen to compliment the champagne. Superb touches and surprises accompanied each plate of food.  Well done Gareth and team on a brilliant success. ",5,2014,07,17
206,Other hotels must climb high to reach The Marker,"Recently opened, part of the ""Leading Hotels of the World"" chain, at the magnificent ""New Dublin"" neighbourhood of the docs, in front of the mirabilant Libeskind's Theatre. Really fantastic five-star hotel practicing promotional fares policy at the beginning of it's activity. Cuddles you from the beginning to the very end of your stay. The rooms are large pastel-coloured, modern, perfectly clean, right as the bathroom, climate control is simply faultless, the staff very friendly and helpful. Rooftop restaurant at open air offers you a breath-taking view of the port. Yes, it‚Äôs 1,3 km from O'Connell square, but you'll not wish to leave...",5,2014,07,17
206,Mini Break,"Decent hotel in good location popular with young professionals. The hotel is about a 20min walk along the River Liffey from the main attractions. There is a (not cheap) public car park next door. Would return.
      
      ",4,2014,07,16
206,absolutely fabulous,"From the moment you enter the hotel you feel relaxed.  The rooms are stylish, the rooftop bar is amazing,  the pool is very nice.  The staff is incredibly helpful.  There just isn't anything I could think of that would make this hotel better.",5,2014,07,15
206,5*+ Hotel - Amazing weekend!,"We stayed at The Marker for 3 nights from 11-14 July 2014.  We had taken advantage of an early booking rate and had noticed an offer on tripadvisor for an upgrade including breakfast.  Although we were not able to avail of this offer we were offered an upgrade to a corner suite at an excellent rate which we took.  We were checked in by a lovely Spanlsh girl who I remember was from Santander - she was so nice and smiley and brought us to our room - 135.  Although the view was a bit disappointing (the offices beside and the play park), the room was still lovely - nice and spacious, exceptionally clean and well finished.  Housekeeping staff in the hotel have exceptional standards and the room was perfectly presented every day on our return.  As others have noted the turndown service is also lovely.

The only thing that needs improved is the TV size in the room - it is far too small for the size of the room - it needs to be a 37 or 40 inch tv at least.

We really enjoyed the rooftop bar also - you have great views of the city and staff are very helpful.  The cocktail menu is quite short but staff will make you whatever you wish off the menu.  The Maitre D (from Monaghan) was a good laugh and very pleasant.  the heated seating area is great and we did not need any blankets but there were so many of them if you wanted one.  it was no nice and relaxing on the rooftop.
The spa is wonderful - very clean and relaxing.  
Checkout today was also great with Robert - very pleasant and helpful - Zoltan was also excellent ordering us a taxi and sorting luggage for us.
We will definately be back to this wonderful hotel.",5,2014,07,14
206,Excellent stay at this Top class hotel,"Myself and my Fiance stayed in the hotel on Saturday night for his birthday .. what a fantastic experience it was. The Valet parking, the friendly staff and reception when we arrived couldnt do enough to help us it was first class treatment. When we got to are room we were greated with champange as a birthday token we really felt like VIPs. The room was fantastic looking out to the Bord Gais with full lenght windows we could sip on our champange and watch the world go by. We then went to the Roof top bar again greated with the friendliest of staff, unfortunatly it was cut short as the heavens opened up (typical Irish weather) but Gareth (head chef) came to our rescue and got us a table inside where we recieved amazing food. The next morning we got up for breakfast with a massive choice from fresh fruit to a big fry up the lay out was second to none. We then headed to the pool area which again was amazing the facilitys are just fantastic and the decor just tops it all off we felt like we were in another world..Even though the hotel was paked to the raffters on sat night we still felt like we were the only ones there the staff where so attentive. All in all it was a night we will never forget and a great treat we needed..Thanks to all the staff espically Gareth .. you are a legend.",5,2014,07,14
206,Very impressed,"We stayed at the hotel for the night as we were going to see Dirty Dancing.  The staff are their best asset such warmth throughout the hotel.  
The location is great about ten minutes walk to the city.  The rooms are spectacular especially the bathrooms. 

We were very impressed with the breakfast in the morning and the lovely Italian girl who served us. 

We cannot wait to go back to try out the roof top bar",5,2014,07,14
206,Stylish with good design and great service,Good design and very service oriented staff. We really enjoyed staying in the Docklands away from the hustle and bustle of O'Connell St etc. Dublin central is fairly compact so it is easy to get everywhere. A lot of it is personal preference -- modern design vs traditional hotel and quieter area vs bustling. The room was very spacious as well with a wonderfully comfortable marble bathroom.,5,2014,07,13
206,Huge recommendation!!,Stayed at this hotel. Excellent everything. We felt as if we knew the staff personally. They could not have been more helpful and friendly. Right beside the canal and bord gas energy theatre. We can't wait to go back,5,2014,07,12
206,Easily the best... by far.,"From the moment we entered, by every staff member greeted with a smile and exceptional service. The rooms are modern, comfortable and have absolutely everything you need. Very stylish hotel, bar and restaurant and would be very hard for anyone to fault anything. The rooftop offers exceptional cocktails ans condiments with exquisite views. 
The pool is very relaxing and the bed is the type you never want to leave. 1 night in the marker will leave u with so many memories... thank you to all the staff!",5,2014,07,12
206,fantastic hotel,"stayed at the marker for 2 nights recently ,this hotel is top class,all staff from household to management were very friendly and helpful,the location is great, for such a top class hotel the atmosphere was very relaxed ,the rooms are beautiful and spotless clean..cant wait to go back there again",5,2014,07,10
206,Marker hotel tops again ,"We have just stayed in the Marker Hotel in the Docklands, Dublin. This is our second time, the last this time last year. On arrival the doorman remembered us, on the second day which was my GFs Birthday she was greeted with a happy birthday madam when entering the hotel, brill touch. The staff are as expected for this type of hotel, professional, courteous, cool, trendy and know when to have a joke with customers and when not. We had an issue where my GF got her shoe caught in a ridge on the deck with shoes she just bought that day and the heal ripped, with in 30 mins they had come back to say that they will fix or replace even knowing they were ‚Ç¨255. We all make mistakes it's how there dealt with that's important. The spa is stunning and a great place to chill. Rooms are contempory and real cosy :) enjoy of your staying, it's for sure our favorite hotel.

206,Fantastic hotel with excellent staff.,Stayed for 2 nights in July 2014. We had arrived at the Hotel at 9 am with the intention of leaving our bags and checking in later but the room was ready straight away which was a bonus! The staff were all very friendly and helpful and made us feel welcome right from stepping out of the taxi. We were given the choice of two rooms - one with a bigger bathroom including a bath and one with a view. The room we choose was the one with a view on the top floor and was great.  Breakfast was good with plenty of choice - hot and cold. I cannot fault the hotel at all and would recommend in a flash!,5,2014,07,09
206,Excellent,"This hotel is fantastic, the staff are very attentive, the rooms are very comfortable, ours over looked the theatre front and canal, I really liked the underfloor heating in the bathroom. The rooftop bar is awesome with great views, it is on the expensive side but we were on a birthday treat weekend so that didn't bother us at all.
It's a lovely area, within walking distance of the Aviva Stadium (20 minutes) Temple Bar (20 minutes) Connolly Station (15 minutes),
We did all three. I would most certainly consider staying here again.
Good Job Marker, Thanks.",5,2014,07,08
206,Weekend retreat,The marker is a very nice well appointed hotel. The staff are very helpful and leave no stone unturned.  Some however were a little moody. The room was very nice and very clean bathroom very spacious.  The spa was good however the steam room needs to be checked more regularly for steam!  Overall we had a good experience.,4,2014,07,08
206,First class service,"Stayed for 3 nights, found all the staff very friendly and helpful when required. Upon arrival at 12 they checked us in and had a room ready by 1 (2 hours before the allotted time) We stayed in a superior room and was amazing with a huge bathroom! Good minibar, tea/coffee, apple charger and all luxury items in the room. Maid service was excellent and to a high standard. Didn't eat in the hotel other than breakfast which was a good selection but probably not the best I've seen but good none the less. 
Visited the rooftop bar which was fantastic in the sun (blankets and heaters when it gets chillier!) a real good atmosphere and space with views over Dublin, definitely a place to visit. 
There is a taxi rank right next to the hotel with a few restaurants close by, taxi to city centre was ~8 Euros. 
Used the spa for the Sunday package and was a wonderful experience with excellent pool/Jacuzzi facilities and a great Spa treatment and relaxation Area. 
Would definitely visit again without hesitation.",5,2014,07,07
206,Fabulous modern hotel,"Just stayed at this lovely modern hotel.

206,Luxurious stay and a real treat,"My partner treated me to a stay in the Marker in April of this year to celebrate our anniversary. I had high expectations given what I'd heard about the hotel and I really wasn't disappointed. 
We enjoyed a most amazing spa treatment and massage shortly after we checked into our rooms.
Our room was on the 3rd floor over looking the now vibrant Grand Canal area - the fittings and furnishings were all of the highest stands and we loved the decor. There were plenty of lovely touches, and it was delightful to be greeted with bubbly and a token anniversary treat.
We enjoyed a delicious meal in the hotels restaurant, where the service was again fantastic. 
If I was to say one thing we were disappointed by it would be that we weren't able to get up to the rooftop bar - this was something we had been very excited about when we arrived - we were told by security that it was too busy and that we would have to try another time. It would have been the real icing on the cake if we had been able to at least get a glimpse.
Overall we had a really great stay and hope to return when we visit dublin again.",5,2014,07,03
206,Excellent Hotel with very friendly staff.,"Myself and my wife stayed last Sunday night, it was for my wife's birthday and having told the reservation agent a desert was in our room when we arrived. A really nice touch. My wife used the spa and she describes as a wonderful experience.  When we walked through the hotel at any time we were always greeted by a member of staff.  This is a fantastic hotel and we will most definitely be back.  ",5,2014,07,02
206,Great Hotel,"We stayed here for three nights and couldn't have been happier with it. The staff are very friendly and couldn't be more helpful. The rooms are big and very clean, the beds are amazing and very comfortable. I asked for a room with a bath and got a bathroom with a bath and a walk in shower. There was a small problem with the smell of drains in our room but the staff investigated it and we were offered another room. As it was our last night we refused as we couldn't be bothered to pack and then unpack so they sent us a free bottle of wine and discounted one of our bar bills. We didn't try the food but the bar staff were very attentive and the wine a good quality. Over all one of the best hotel stays I have had in a long while and I am very fussy!!!",5,2014,07,02
206,A Dublin treat with style,"Hard to find, on first visit, but well located in the Grand Canal area near the Theatre and restaurants, but away from the shopping part of the city. Circular 'on/off' tour buses stop 100 metres from the front of the hotel.  Service was slick, hiccup when we checked out early to catch a ferry and the bellboy forgot (within 10 minutes) a call to collect our luggage.  Apart from that service was what one would expect from a top hotel which prides itself on being one of the top 400 in the world.  Rooms are light and airy, with all mod cons and ultra modern interactive TV/Computer system. Very cool. Food in restaurant not exceptional but acceptable, pricey for what it was. Wine is expensive. Would re-visit.",5,2014,07,02
206,Weekend break,"I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday this weekend. It was amazing! The hotel was fab and staff were so nice! The swimming pool was lovely, rooms were gorgeous! Not far from the hustle and bustle in Dublin. Not a bad thing to say about this place I would definitely recommend staying here! It was well worth the money ",5,2014,06,29
206,Snobby,"we stayed at the Marker for 3 nights...NOT a family friendly hotel.  The staff was snobby,  Maybe for young single people this would be good but definitely not a family.  We had to get 2 roll aways and I asked if they were comfortable...we were assured they were...they were horrilbe...like sleeping on a board.  For the price of this hotel they should have a better way to accomodate families.",3,2014,06,29
206,Perfect for the Convention Center,"Superb luxury hotel with service that may outdo the Ritz.  Chic modern design.  Excellent breakfasts.  Rooftop bar is fun.  Ten to 20 minute walk to Trinity College and Grafton Street and perhaps five or ten minute walk to convention center.  If you walk to Trinity/Grafton/Temple Bar, take a few more minutes and walk along the river.  It does cost more than nearby choices, but it is worth it.",5,2014,06,26
206,Newer mod canal front hotel,"I stayed at the Marker for three nights in late May and thought the experience rather pleasant.  
While the room was large, bright and clean, it was the service that was commendable.  Everyone I encountered, from front desk to Brasserie servers to housekeeping staff, was friendly, courteous and helpful.
Nice touches in the room were heated bathroom floor tiles, a great little french press coffee maker and the t.v. touch screen menu. The bed was large and comfy, with nice linens and a good quality mattress. Little mint chocolates were offered at turndown service, which I happily gobbled up.
The view from the rooftop bar was simply stunning, and the spa was beautiful.  A particularly nice touch, even compared to the very fancy (albeit pricey) hotel spas I've sampled, including the Fairmont Montreux, was the post-massage refreshment of a little juice bottle and snack.
I ate the pre-theatre menu at Brasserie and thought the chicken with lentils and broccolini was just delicious.  I did not care for the recommended salmon starter, which they deleted from the bill without my asking.  The breakfast buffet, included in my package, was excellent and included delicious yoghurts, muesli and other cereals, small but tasty pastries, and great scrambled eggs and several breakfast meat choices.  The service was so excellent that they fulfilled my hopeful request to snag one cronut and a made to order green juice. 
One small quibble: my package included an upgrade to the next room category, which I'd hoped meant a canal view.  However, the upgraded room had a view of the kiddie park (ironic since I am sans rugrats), and was about a nose length from the large building directly adjacent.  I'm starting to wonder if I repeatedly get crummy views at five star hotels (with the notable exception of Grand Resort Bad Ragaz) because I'm a solo traveler, or perhaps because I ask for a quiet room?  To be fair, (once again) I happened to be in Dublin over a bank holiday weekend, and I did check in late. They definitely gave me an upgrade, as the room was very large,and, with the exception of an air vent in the bathroom, quiet.
While The Marker does not have the enviable location of, say, The Westbury,  I think they are well on their way to being a successful addition to the Dublin hotel market.",5,2014,06,25
206,The staff makes this a true experience,"I stayed here for business, and chose the hotel mainly for its location close to the Convention Centre, and based on the good reviews. I arrived from the airport by bus, and from the moment I checked in everything went smoothly. I was shown to my room by a very friendly and polite man. The room had everything I needed; a comfy bed, a desk, sitting area, good wifi, hair dryer, ironing board etc. I loved especially the marble bathroom with a tub and separate shower area, and the Malin & Goetz amenities!

During my stay all members of the staff were always polite, friendly and seemed to be genuinely in a good mood, and I feel that they were what made this truly a five star experience. My room was kept in top notch condition, with evening turndown service.

The breakfast selection was wide enough, and the quality was exceptionally good. Special thanks to the personnel working there during breakfast, they made my day every morning! I tried the bar on the night of my arrival, the drinks were okay and the salad was a fresh take on something that could easily have been boring. I also had the pleasure to visit the roof top bar, which was very nice. During my stay I used the pool several times, and found it good for swimming long distance too; in the mornings it wasn't too crowded either. The pool area was also very nice.

The hotel is located about a 15 min walk from the city centre, which I didn't find too long, but I didn't have the chance to visit the centre every day. For this type of trip I found the hotel more than perfect, and was very happy with my stay!",5,2014,06,24
206,Amazing hotel review cont.,"Just realised I never finished my review from my stay in March! From start to finish the Marker made the whole Dublin experience a perfect one! 

As discussed in my previous review the room was beautiful with large bed, crisp white sheets, perfect pillows and a huge marble bathroom with rainfall shower and bathtub! 

The hotel was all about the little touches ensuring we had a fabulous stay. The food was also delicious. Great selection at breakfast with cooked breakfast, eggs and omelettes available with wide choice of fillings. Detox strawberry water was especially nice. Fresh fruit, pastries you name it they had it. Unfortunately we didn't get to sample the rooftop bar as we got lost in the many bars in Dublin and didn't make it back in time. 

We both had fully body massages in the spa and have to say they were amazing but be warned they can be deep massages so can make you very sleepy afterwards not advised before a night out in Dublin city perhaps as more of a detox the next day! The hammock chill out area is very relaxing and the pool, jacuzzi and steam rooms make the experience complete. 

Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a modern yet comfortable stay in a great location to explore Dublin city. I am currently looking to book to come back at the end if July and in September and will be booking in here. ",5,2014,06,24
206,Modern and stylish,"This hotel is based by the quays very close to the centre of Dublin. There are some great bars and restaurants nearby and Temple Bar ids less than a 15 minute walk or 5 minutes in a cab.
The rooftop terrace is very chic with fantastic views and if you're lucky enough to have a sunny day you can spend hours up there.
Bedrooms were stylish, spacious and comfortable, my only complaint was the breakfast which was 'buffet style' (always a euphemism for cheap and not very cheerful) which you don't expect from a 5 star hotel. When I saw the runny scrambled eggs and the ageing bacon my heart sank. Raj the excellent restaurant manager cheered me up again by listening intently to my moaning and promising to submit my thoughts to the Management. Lets hope that by the time you stay there a freshly cooked option is available.",5,2014,06,24
206,Overrated and expensive,Stayed with my wife for our first year wedding anniversary and we were most disappointed. For a 5 star hotel we felt the hotel was very basic. The staff were very helpful and friendly but it was not what we expected from a 5 star hotel we both agreed it was over rated and especially when the staff knew it was our anniversary there was no nice touches which we have previously received in other hotels. I would not recommend the hotel for a special occasion. ,3,2014,06,23
206,First visit to Dublin and this hotel chain,"Excellent location, staff, food and facilities. Near enough to walk to the city centre as long as mobility isn't an issue but far enough away not too feel too touristy. Probably not so good if you have children. Swimming pool and gym excellent. Not cheap, but well worth the money. Only had one meal there, fish and chips, best fish and chips for ages. Had a drink one night at the rooftop bar. Wonderful views of Dublin.",5,2014,06,23
206,Too far from city center,"The Marker is a very nice hotel with a lovely rooftop bar and friendly staff. I just wish it were closer to the city center. It is a 18 min walk and there are very few conveniences nearby (ie pharmacy, restaurants, grocery). I was in need of some pharmacy items as my bag was lost. The hotel has no shop and we didn't feel like walking or taking a taxi to the nearest pharmacy.   As with all hotels we stayed at on this trip there is no ice machine or vending- only a mini bar. I also did not like the lack of a top sheet. There is only the duvet.",3,2014,06,23
206,Modern Hotel. Great Customer Service,"Stayed here for one night while on a business trip. Great, modern and new hotel. Customer service is second to none!
Beautiful hotel overlooking the canal with all the amenities you would expect. Only issue for me was the low lighting everywhere, but that's probably just my age!
Breakfast had lost of choice and the chef made me an amazing bowl of porridge with honey. Great start to the day.
Quite expensive per night but it is a city centre hotel.",4,2014,06,22
206,The only place to be seen?,"The architecture alone draws you into the Marker Hotel, fingers crossed its service delivers on the all important first impression... Thankfully this is one of the very few hotels that truly ticks all the boxes, from reception to restaurant to spa, but the piece de resistance has to be Dublins only roof top bar and is the best for cocktails, the downside and there has to be one, expect long queues, and if the sun is out....",4,2014,06,22
206,"Modern, clean and stylish but a little far from the centre","This is an excellent hotel, with great rooms and restaurant (for breakfast or dinner). Its stylish and modern and having only recently been built is in great condition. The service is attentive and helpful, and nothing was too much trouble (although we were not particularly demanding guests) and the rooms are so well insulated that it is very quite inside. The one downside, is that it is a good fifteen to twenty five minutes walk into Dublin City centre, and while the area around the hotel is relatively well served for bars, and some restaurants, you will want to go into town. In the end we were using a least one taxi a day (10 euros) to get back, having walked in, and if you come back to the hotel before going out in the evening as we did a couple of times, then the taxi costs mount up. This, of course is not the hotel's fault, but if you tire easily and do not fancy a lot of walking, and are not keen on cabs you might be better staying nearer town.",4,2014,06,22
206,"The calsburgh of city centre hotels, fab from top to tail.","Great hotel, lovely friendly helpful genuine staff from valet parking to roof top bar staff. The location is great, there is a really great lively vibe in this hotel, great buzz, but at the same time with a chilled feel that instantly allows you tune out and relax.  The rooms are spacious and well designed. All in all loved it I will definitely stay there again and have already recommended it. My only negative comment would be that breakfast should be included in room rate, in my experience that would be standard for this class of hotel.
 ",5,2014,06,21
206,Good,Hotel had just opened. Nice big rooms looking out on grand canal square. No complaints. Only issue is the queuing for the terrace bar. Residents should have ongoing access rather than queues.......all good.....,5,2014,06,20
206,"Amazing, Wonderful, Amazing!!","I got a special offer on the http://www.canalboatrestaurant.ie/ which starts off at Mespil Place & ends up in Grand Canal Dock....babysitter offered to keep our little girl for the night so we jumped on the idea of finding somewhere in/close to Grand Canal Dock for the night.  Above our budget for sure but TOTALLY worth it....I booked a package which got us an automatic upgrade in room - oh boy was that a good idea.  We ended up in the most amazing suite....separate sitting room, spare toilet room, huge ensuite bathroom &  fabulously comfortable bed.  We arrived, dropped our car at the door (we had prebooked valet parking), checked in, went to our room, marveled at the upgrade & hit the pool.  More luxury - dark grey tiled pool, sauna, steam room, jaccuzi - all wonderful.  The little things make all the difference...a machine in the changing room to dry your swimming togs - nice!!  Back to the room, got ready for dinner & made our way to the rooftop bar - what a view...there were only outside seats available & even though it wasn't the warmest of evenings it didn't matter.  We were seated under a heater, given blankets & I was even brought a hot water bottle.  I had a Virgin Mojito - delicious, my partner had a few bottles of craft beer.  Then we went for our canal boat dinner & back for a nightcap in the hotel.  Back to the room, the bed had been turned down & a chocolate left on our pillows.  Next morning we went down for breakfast after a quick dip in the pool.  The buffet is fantastic but in true greedy fashion I also ordered from the A La Carte menu - equally delicious & totally worth the few extra euro.  When we were ready to check out we went to reception, our car was waiting outside & off we went.  Like I said above - a bit above our price range but so very, very worth it for a treat!!",5,2014,06,19
206,style over function,"a new hotel near grand canal, very snazzy on first look, but actually staying there you notice how little function was thought of when doing the design.  The windows don't open, so you are stuck with air-conditioning that makes a racket.  and there are 2 controls, but no way to work out why or for what.  The glass shower enclosure looks great, but the bathroom door gets stuck with the bathmat.  The marble looks lovely, but is dangerous when wet.  The passage carpets are deep and sumptuous, but you can't pull a wheeled bag on them....and so on...",3,2014,06,19
206,Best design hotel in Ireland,"Great modern hotel, every single detail is beautifully designed. Rooms are awesome, and spa and gym are definitely what you expect from a modern 5 star hotel.

Great food! Breakfast was amazing, and burgers at the hotel bar are a must. Rooftop is pretty amazing as well.

The location is perfect, close to most of the tech companies, although it is a bit far away from the center, tje hotel fits perfectly its location, being integrated as part of the environment!",5,2014,06,19
206,Truly 5 star hotel,"My partner and I stayed at The Marker for just one night but wanted to stay all week! It's a very modern and smart hotel overlooking the canal and the service was second to none. 

The room itself was spacious, very well decorated and the bed was ridiculously comfortable. The spa was wonderful, with a full length infinity pool, jacuzzi and steam/sauna room as was the rooftop bar which we frequented before and after dinner for a wide selection of cocktails and whiskies! The hotel is also walking distance from Dublin city centre, a 20 minute stroll along the river, which we didn't mind given the relatively peaceful area in which The Marker is located, alongside those fantastic facilities. 

In terms of the service, at check in we were asked if we were celebrating anything in particular so I mentioned it was our anniversary - after coming back up from the spa that afternoon, we found a beautifully presented plate of cake and a note congratulating us! A very sweet and unexpected gesture. 

The only inconvenience we encountered - a broken toilet flush - saw us switch rooms at about 11pm, but it was dealt with swiftly by the highly professional staff.
 
We would highly recommend this hotel and shall certainly stay again if back in Dublin.",5,2014,06,18
206,Excellent hotel with 5 Star Service,"Stayed last week for a Conference across the River from the Conference Center, Dublin.  This hotel is in a quiet area away from the hustle and bustle of Central Dublin.  Check-in was very smooth and an explanation of using the room card for the elevator was helpful after a long flight.  My room was large, the wifi very good, shower and bath both available and a hidden cupboard with coffee, tea and mini bar was handy to have.
The breakfast was the same every day, so it was a bit tiring eating the same things, but it was well prepared and offered an assortment of meats and cheeses, besides the scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage.  
Turndown service in the evening and a complementary paper in the morning were appreciated.
It was a nice walk to the Convention Centre and not too far to the City Centre either, so it can be done by foot or by cab.
It is definitely a hotel I would consider if and when I travel back to Dublin.",5,2014,06,17
206,"A perfect stay, quality hotel and superb staff!!","Stayed at The Marker 3 nights for my Wifes 40th birthday, the staff were superb and the hotel immaculate.

From the moment we arrived we knew it was the perfect hotel for us, we were checked in to room 514 which had views over the square and the water ‚Äì ideal! We were given a very warm welcome at reception by Robert during check-in and who very kindly wished my wife a happy birthday, once in the room the hotel delivered two glasses of complimentary champagne and cake, a very nice touch! 

The hotel has a lovely roof top terrace bar and also bar in the foyer area, the service again was slick and nothing was too much trouble ‚Äì the cocktails were amazing, we‚Äôd recommend the Gin and Tonic Mojito and The Liberal. Around the hotel there are a few places to eat and drink, Ely serve great food and a very relaxed vibe.

A perfect 3 night stay, sad to leave and really looking forward to going back very soon.",5,2014,06,16
206,Super slick Dublin hotel,This is a very cool hotel a little bit away of the hustle and bustle of Dublin. The rooms are lovely and big with comfy beds and a fab modern bathroom. Very modern design with grey and green colour scheme. The rooftop bar is very nice as you don't that much in Ireland and the clientele were very smart. I would recommend having a few cocktails there. Breakfast was great and all the staff were extremely helpful. It is also walking distance to the Aviva. The Spa is lovely however a lot of the rooms weren't working which was disappointing and the pool could have been a bit bigger but we weren't there for that so it didn't really matter to us. Parking was a bit of an issue however with no more spaces available when we arrived.,5,2014,06,14
206,Thirsty crew Irish Spring Tour 2014,"We stayed here for a couple of days while we were in Dublin. I have to say it was amazing. The room we had,was a deluxe facing the Bord Gais Energy Theatre & had a nice view of the square below. Free wifi,huge big comfy bed & fab bathroom with cool toiletries. Breakfast was great again, served by a lovely girl called Velia. Hope I have spelt her name right. Nothing too much trouble for any of the staff. The only slight thing would be I would change the black pudding supplier,I have had better in other places in Ireland. Plenty of bars,restaurants around the hotel also for evening eats. Also the rooftop bar is an experience too. Again,fantastic service,blankets,hot water bottles. Fab views specially of the mountains & the sea. Pretty easy place to get out & about. Quick taxi is no problem.All in all I would Definately stay here again. Fab place.",5,2014,06,08
206,What a lovely hotel,"My husband and I stayed recently there while attending War Horse in the Bord Gas theatre. It is a perfect location for attending any shows there, directly across from it. From the moment we entered we were greeted by a staff member and welcomed, he was aware of the check in reception being busy so he directed to another check in desk which we were attended to immediately. The gentleman was very helpful and professional, he informed us of all the services available and offered us an upgrade which was fantastic, the room was beautiful, looking out on the canal. After the show we went on to the roof top bar which was lovely. Next morning we had a beautiful breakfast and relaxed in the foyer for a while. Overall it was a lovely experience.",5,2014,06,07
206,"Top notch hotel in ""New Dublin""",This amazing hotel in Dublin Docklands gives a fresh view of Dublin. This hotel is just a short stroll along the water to the must see parts of Dublin but is in a beautiful water surrounded backdrop to give you that chance to really unwind. The staff here are excellent and very welcoming. They are knowledgeable and of the highest standard. The in house brasserie serves up five star cuisine to round out the experience. This hotel was one of the finds of our trip to Ireland and we would happily stay again if we happened to find ourselves in Dublin again.,5,2014,06,06
206,Fantastic stay,Second visit here and it's getting better and better. I was greeted by Barry at the front door.My check in was very professional and prompt. I was checked in by Gary who was a wealth of knowledge with services to offer and gave me some fantastic eatery offers outside the hotel as I requested he also gave me his business card and said to not hesitate to contact him directly if I require further assistance 5 star service.the  room was well equipped  with a very comfortable bed. The one big let down with the hotel is the standard of the bar food on offer. Service was very good but it's the second time I have had some very average bar food. They have a simple selection of food on the menu but to get a club sandwich so wrong is a basic error. The pool and spa area are well worth a visit and if your going to bord gais it's an ideal venue. On my check out I called the front desk and asked for my car to be returned and this was a fantastic service. Check out was very perfect and I'm looking forward to a return visit. Hopefully bar food will have improved ,5,2014,06,06
206,Great Cocktails,"Stayed here Saturday 31 May 2014.  We were going to a show in the Bord Gais, Singing in the Rain.  We ate in the bar,  food was just ok.  Wine and cocktails were lovely.  The rooftop bar after the show was really nice, the staff were lovely and you could get blankets or hot water bottles if you wanted, which is a nice touch.  The room was fine but there was no bath and we think a five star hotel should have a bath.  The mini was really well stocked and the bed was comfy,  we got a good room overlooking the Bord Gais, room 616.  The staff and the service in this hotel are helpful, attentive and very pleasant.  Would recommend this hotel for them alone.",4,2014,06,04
206,Best Dublin hotel I've stayed in,"This hotel is great.  Attentive check in staff who, after completing the paperwork, didn't just point me to the lifts but walked me to them.  The room is clean and comfortable.  The bathroom is fantastic, with a full bath and separate wet-room style shower.  It's clean, comfortable and quiet.  I just wish I was staying for more than one night!",5,2014,06,03
206,Pure class,"I stayed at the Marker Hotel for two nights while being in Dublin on a business trip. The hotel is very nice, my room was very spacious, the bed was great, but if anything, the service was even better. From I first walked in until I left, they couldn't have done more to make it a great stay. This is easiest the best hotel I have stayed in in a long time and I couldn't recommend it enough.",5,2014,06,03
206,Great Location in Dublin,Great boutique hotel in Dublin. The staff was very accommodating and the hotel was lovely. We were able to walk all over Dublin from this location. Was larger then we usually choose when we are traveling but all the staff was so friendly that they made it feel small and cozy. Breakfast was great even though it was not included in the room rate we ate there two mornings it was so good.,5,2014,06,01
206,The Marker is The Hotel in Dublin,"I don't know about others, but staying at The Marker is a very good experience when in Dublin, for work or vacations. Nice rooms and bathrooms, fantastic breakfast (although a little expensive - 15 euros), relaxing pool and saunas - free for hosts and a very polite staff. A tip: take a drink at the lounge bar. Stunning view! And better: placed in a calm area not too far from the centre.",5,2014,05,31
206,Simply the best!,"It has been a great stay at the Marker Hotel. Staffs are super courteous and the room & facilities are superb! Their linens are super soft and all amenities are of great designer.
Their minibar has everything you would need, includes a red wine and bottled water. Of course for a fee  =)
The location is by the Dublin Convention Ctr, about 7' walk to the LUAN. Very nice surrounding and quiet area. Their spa and restaurant is superb, chic and romantic!",5,2014,05,27
206,Amazing Stay,"Stayed there from 23rd May 2014 to 27th May 2014, can't say enough about the hotel except the whole stay was absolutely amazing, the staff was great, the food was stunning, the pool area made you feel really relaxed.  Perfect location, perfect views especially from the roof top bar.  I would recommend it.  Thanks for a great weekend.",5,2014,05,27
206,Beautiful rooms & outstanding service,"We stayed at this wonderful hotel for one night only - I could have happily stayed for a year. From the warmest welcome possible, the tone was set for a truly memorable stay. We arrived mid morning and were able to check in to our room. Escorted upstairs, the room features and amenities were fully explained and were of the highest quality. Our room overlooked the canal and was light and bright. The bathroom was a highlight - floor to ceiling marble, hugely spacious with bath & walk in shower. In terms of service throughout our stay, the staff anticipated our every need. They were impeccably polite, remembered our names and the level of personal attention received in every area of the hotel - brasserie, rooftop bar, reception and concierge - was outstanding. Our car was valet parked which was well worth it as there is very little parking around this area. It takes approximately 20 minutes to walk into the city centre - a very pleasant walk along the river. A most memorable stay.",5,2014,05,27
206,Doing the small things perfectly!,"This hotel surpassed all my expectations and my husband's! This was the best hotel we've been to in a long time. As far as five star hotels, they all have a standard to keep to so it's the little things that make all the difference and The Marker Hotel has perfected this art! Everything from the note and sweets welcoming us in the room and to congratulate us on our anniversary; the most welcoming of receptionists Robert and the doorman/concierge Stephen who were so accommodating and helpful without trying too hard! The attention to detail was second to none, the breakfast, scrumptious! We didn't eat dinner there but we will the next time we stay.
The rooms are spacious, the bathroom luxurious! The only negative comment I would make is the room was a tad on the warm side and we couldn't figure out the a/c to get it cool but it's a minor complaint amid the plethora of wonderful this hotel has to offer! And of course, I left with the obligatory box of cronuts (2 actually!) for the kids!!! Mmmmm
We'll be back again! Thank you for a lovely anniversary!",5,2014,05,27
206,Super Hotel,"Just spent a long weekend in Dublin, and The Marker Hotel was just lovely. A contemporary hotel in a good location just outside of the City Centre and with great views, very convenient for all of the sites.

Even though we took our three children with us, the hotel were extremely accommodating, and gave us a suite which fitted us all in, what a refreshing change ! none of the other hotels in the City could flex to offer us this. 

We had a lovely breakfast included which was really nice, the bar area for drinks is cool and modern. We had afternoon tea, the children had hot chocolate and little cookies (which they have reared about all week).

We had turn down service on the beds, fresh towels and linens, jus what we wanted and would expect from such a top notch hotel, and a fantastic nights sleep.The bathroom was huge and roomy, with lovely toiletries, I would highly recommend to families, couples and business people, just a superb all round great place.

The Hotel looks stunning at night too, with the urban forest outside, and it is right next to a theatre too. During our stay they were running Singing in the rain... definitely a return visit is required.

I would definitely recommend The Marker, and if we come to Dublin again, we will make this our first choice.

We didn't get a chance to try out the rooftop bar, as it was closed during our stay, (we will just have to come back!)......",5,2014,05,27
206,Feeling Pampered,"Great hotel in Central Dublin, Relaxing few days at Grand Canal Basin - sunshine made it feel like the continent - kids swimming, breakfast by the river, lovely room, great dinner in the restaurant, bit on the expensive side but worth every penny",5,2014,05,27
206,Brilliant,"Stayed at the Marker for a short weekend break with a friend.  They allowed for early check In at 9 am after our transatlantic flight, which is so wonderful when all you want is to have a shower and nap. The rooms were lovely, nice beds, though I found it a bit hot in the room from time to time.   The location was a bit far away from the main attractions of Dublin, about a 20 minute walk, but the walk served us well given given that we just ate and drank once we were there!  We went to the rooftop bar, which was amazing, and nice that they furnished you with blankets.  We were advised by locals to take a cab back at night as the walk could be dodgy, but it was generally inexpensive and the Dublin cab drivers are a good laugh.  Great stay.",5,2014,05,27
206,Flawless Stay!,"I can't recommend this hotel enough. Flawless rooms, efficient staff, perfect location for a city break. Stunning panoramic views of the city from the roof top terrace. We emailed to ask for our boarding passes- less than 3 minutes later they were under our door! No ask is too much",5,2014,05,25
206,"Impeccable service, great location","This was not my first time in Dublin, but was my first time in this hotel and staying in this part of town. The hotel is a really nice property! Clean, comfortable and quiet in the rooms, but with activity downstairs and on the rooftop bar. The rooftop bar is really cool, with a view of Dublin and blankets for the Dublin weather. What really stands out about this hotel is the impeccable service. Truly attentive staff that were tripping over themselves to ensure I had a good stay, but not in an obtrusive way. From the bellmen to the desk staff to the housekeeping staff, everyone was spot on and I felt really well taken care of. This part of Dublin has really developed into a fun part of town. Restaurants, theaters, and bars, this area is nice and is close enough to other major shopping/restaurant areas as well. I hope I can get back to Dublin soon and stay here again!",5,2014,05,23
206,The Marker Hotel's Perfect Location for Dublin Visitors,"'Stayed at The Marker for the first time last Saturday. Its a fantastic Hotel right on the water at Grand Canal Dock in the heart of Dublin. Valet parking at the door was a great start and the very helpful Front Desk got us off and running. The bedrooms are as good if not better thank most in this part of the world - excellent WiFi, heated Bathroom Floors, AirCon, Coffee/Tea Room Bar, and a ""proper"" shower. The views are unique and if you goo to the Roof Bar for an evening drink as the sun sets, you will see Dublin as never before. The Restaurant Breakfast is also very good and evening dinner with very attentive service made it a relaxing experience. On checking out, the Valet Parking returned my car with bottle of water on board for all the passengers - a very nice but simple touch. 'Did not get a chance to check out the Spa but I really enjoyed The Marker and would recommend it to all - families and singles.",5,2014,05,22
206,Nothing to fault,"The Marker represents a very well run hotel where nothing is too much trouble for the staff.  We arrived late on business and ordered some bar food after 10pm, when the kitchen was due to close.  After a little negotiation the staff kept it open for a little and when the food arrived it was excellent. 

Rooms are very plush and comfortable.  Breakfast is a similarly high quality to the evening food, with a wide selection of options.  Will stay again if I find myself back on business.  Probably a little expensive for a leisure trip though....",5,2014,05,21
206,Fab,"Beautiful hotel, excellent staff with excellent attention to detail! Great cocktails and food is very good. Very mod hotel and the roof top bar is amazing with fantastic views. Very child friendly.Would highly recommend for business or leisure",5,2014,05,19
206,Superb in every way!,"Have just returned from a 3 night stay at Marker with my husband & we cannot praise the hotel highly enough! It was fantastic in every way from start to finish! The service & attention to detail would show anyone in hospitality how to do it right! We did not encounter one bad staff member & each and everyone of them go out of their way to assist in every  way! The rooms are very modern & spacious & serviced  so well each day with excellent cleaning & fabulous products of which there is no shortage! All I can say is stay here if you get a chance , you won't be disappointed! Can't wait to go back! ",5,2014,05,18
206,Incredible,"We stayed here for one night, and I can only wish we had of stayed for more. What an incredible hotel, with the most professional staff I have ever encountered. The hotel itself is a beautiful building, with a very modern, elegant layout. We had a last minute get-together with friends for a birthday at the bar downstairs. We were then escorted and welcomed up to the rooftop bar, and were told to relax as there was bar service (the views are stunning). The staff continued to be attentive and welcoming of our group, by arranging a beautiful chocolate fruit cake from the brasserie and decorated plate for my friend's birthday. The rooms were ideal, and the complementary cosmetics were top notch. Also the bottles of water in the car from the porter was a nice touch, as were the chocolates and goodnight mats on the floor when we arrived back to the room. This hotel is very reasonably priced, the price was in no way pretentious and breakfast was included. The breakfast was to my liking with a great selection of foods on offer. I honestly cant fault this place, I would only say that there should maybe be a reservation system with the rooftop bar, as there are limited tables and it would really be a shame to miss out on this if you're a guest.",5,2014,05,18
206,Best hotel I've been to in Dublin!,"Modern hotel in great location in downtown Dublin, by canal. Great service with very eager to please staff complemented spacious VERY pleasant rooms with state of the art furnishings (nothing missing that I can think of), free wifi, well equipped gym (including weights, cardio, rowing machine, etc..). Not inexpensive but I was lucky to get all of this at a relatively low room price in mid May. I will definitely be back!",5,2014,05,18
206,Did not stay at the hotel but they were very helpful,We stopped into the hotel to meet up with a person.  We had our luggage in tow.  We were not staying in the hotel but they stored our bags a gave us coffee and water in the lobby.  They have good wifi in the lobby.  We also enjoyed brunch in the lobby restaurant.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.,4,2014,05,18
206,Amazing Hotel,"We are just back from a two night stay @ The Marker- - what a hotel!!! Absolutely gorgeous, ultra modern with extremely friendly staff.  The rooms are clean and comfortable, with everything you need to hand - the attention to detail is second to none!!  The rooftop bar is gorgeous and the cocktails delicious.  I couldn't fault the hotel on anything and their staff are the best I've come across.  I can't wait to go back again üòÄ",5,2014,05,18
206,Favourite hotel I have been to,"I stayed here with my boyfriend in May. The whole stay was perfect. The staff went beyond themselves to be helpful. All the small touches are fabulous. 
The rooms are beautiful, I love the shower and bathroom. Swimming pool and changing rooms spotless. Rooftop bar is stunning at night time. Make sure to eat in the restaurant.
Overall the hotel made our stay so memorable. I will definitely be back. ",5,2014,05,17
206,Beware of valet parking,"Fantastic hotel in great location which we enjoyed for 2 nights. The room was very comfortable and the welcome we recieved and the assistance of staff when ever we ask for help was great. The pool was lovely as was the roof top bar, with great view over Dublin.
Our only complaint was when our car was brought round, when we were leaving, from the hotel carpark and discovered scratches down one side of the car. It's a very small carpark aparently and space is tight (we do not drive a huge car). To be fair, they did pay for the car to be repaired after some discussions and took full responsibility but we were not the first time incident of its kind we were told......you have been warned. Park the car yourself!",4,2014,05,16
206,"Modern, clean, great service","The Marker is a lovely hotel located on the grand canal with terrific views. The staff were very friendly, always looking for an extra opportunity to assist. The hotel was very clean with a modern design and well-appointed rooms. 

The one small flaw was our inability to cool the room using the thermostat. It may have been our inexperience with the thermostat system, but the room ended up being too warm during our stay.

All in all the Marker is a wonderful property and is highly recommended.",4,2014,05,13
206,Fantastic hotel in a great location,"My husband and I stayed for two nights in March and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Location is excellent particularly with the theatre next door. The food was really good and the early bird menu was really good value. We had a delicious breakfast both mornings and the service from the staff was faultless. The rooms were really well soundproofed with an edgy feel. The spa was excellent but far too expensive and this should be looked at as we would have used this more if it was more reasonable. Also I thought residents should have had priority access to the roof terrace bar as the queues were very long and no consideration was given to hotel residents. Other than that, I would recommend this hotel highly.",4,2014,05,13
206,Great stay-great hotel,This is a lovely modern hotel of interesting architectural design. The staff are friendly & attentive. Rooms are a nice size & we had a great view of the dock area. Bathroom was a good size too with both a shower & a bath. Breakfast was very good with excellent service. Restaurant was closed (Monday night) and this was flagged upon booking but bar food was available & very nice. Spa / pool area was up to standard. Just check out the opening hours of the roof top bar - to avoid disappointment! Impossible to get there during our stay despite specifically asking. ,5,2014,05,13
206,"Great experience, wonderful customer service","My husband and I just spent one night in The Marker Hotel over the weekend. It was a wonderful stay. More than anything else, the customer service was absolutely outstanding. The hotel is very comfortable and we enjoyed drinks in the bar and breakfast in bed (promptly served). The pool area is very nice and any time I rang reception, my name was used in conversation. Before going to the marker I sent an email asking for something to be printed out for me on arrival at the hotel and without asking it was presented to me on check in. Check in and out were prompt even though both times were very busy. Hotel is clean, modern and comfortable but as mentioned already here it is customer service at which the Marker excels and that more than anything else is what makes a five star hotel. It is lovely to see hotel workers smiling and greeting you. We will be back.
Ashling",5,2014,05,12
206,Excellent,"Very nice modern hotel with friendly staff. 

Room was fresh and large with, almost, a great view of grand canal. 

Atrium was busy in the evening and roof terrace bar cold however this did not detract from an excellent stay. 

Spa is relaxing however we felt treatments were on the expensive side. 

We look forward to going back! ",5,2014,05,12
206,Excellent!!,We stayed in this hotel for 1 night over a weekend. Our stay was excellent from the start to the finish. The room which was a superior room certainly lived up to its name. It was spacious very comfortable and extremely clean. The pool & jacuzzi were also very good. The staff were the most helpful staff we have has for a long time!! I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to my friends if they were staying in Dublin. ,5,2014,05,11
206,"Excellent hotel, comfortable stay","There are a lot of good reasons to stay here. The rooms are clean, new, well furnished and comfortable, and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. On one occasion we were waiting to ask a question at reception and a porter approached to see if he could assist (he could); taking initiative to be helpful creates a great impression and is a credit to management.  The hotel is about a 15-20 minute walk to the main shopping/eating area of the city, which was fine for us as we like to walk. There are half a dozen restaurants nearby, but the locale appears to be largely residential and offices and fairly quiet. We didn't eat at the hotel and the rooftop bar wasn't open, however there always seemed to be a lot of people in the bar area near the lobby. Easy to reach from the airport as the Aircoach has a stop just a 2 minute walk away. My only gripe is that the downlights for the main basin in the bathroom were too dim and badly positioned, so that even shaving became a guessing game. Given the property is so new I can't see this being addressed any time soon through refurbishment, but it's a shame that something so basic marred an otherwise excellent room layout. Nevertheless, I would highly recommend this hotel and stay here again if we return to Dublin. ",4,2014,05,09
206,Great 5-star Hotel,"Nearly perfect hotel in very nice newly developed docklands area.  Mostly businessmen so you'll have the first-class amenities (pool, spa, steam room, sauna, gym) all to yourselves during the day.  Only negative is 15-20 minute walk to any tourist sights, but you need to walk more anyway.  Rooftop bar was closed for one reason or another so that was a negative - there was only one night during our stay when it was open and only until 11.",5,2014,05,09
206,A lovely stay,Just stayed in the marker hotel. All in all a wonderful experience from the moment we pulled up outside to the moment of departure. Well done in particular to Unni a great host. We look forward to returning in the not too distant future. A great stay,5,2014,05,07
206,Phil's Marker Stay,"We found the staff courteous and efficient. The facilities were very good and the Rooftop Bar well worth a visit. Very convenient and relaxing place to stay especially if you plan to attend an event at the Bord Gais Energy Theatre, only a few steps away.",5,2014,05,07
206,A one-night-holiday experience,"From the moment we arrived and our car was taken for parking until the moment we set off home, our night at the Marker was simply perfect!! The staff were all polite, friendly, efficient and above all helpful! The hotel itself is situated in Grand Canal Square opposite the Bord Gais Energy Theatre. Our room was beautifully appointed overlooking the square and canal, contemporary in design with a fabulous bathroom. We headed to the Rooftop bar for pre-show cocktails and mocktails (as my teen daughter was traveling with me) again the staff were helpful and thoughtful ensuring we were warm as we sat outdoors on a not-so-warm May evening! The following morning we had a lovely breakfast in the brasserie and once again the staff tended to every need with a smile. Later on we headed to the Spa and Wellness centre that truly gave us that ""spa experience"". Check-out was fast and cheery, and as we had a coffee at the bar our car was brought around for us and luggage taken care of. The final touch was finding two bottles of water waiting for us in the car for our journey home..... Our stay at The Marker, though only for one night, felt like a holiday.  Every need was taken care of and always with a smile. I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough and look forward to the next time I get to experience a stay there. ",5,2014,05,04
206,Wonderful bathroom and superb design,"I recently stayed at the Marker for one night while on a business trip in Dublin.
I was very pleased with my room which had a really modern deco with nice and warm colors. The kind bed was confortable even if it doesn't beat the Westin heavenly beds.
The bathroom was just wonderful with separate shower and bath tub. Malin+Goetz products are offered and the Rum body wash was an absolute delight.
I also took breakfast for 15‚Ç¨ which featured a nice choice of pastries, fruits and yogurts.

Overall, I really enjoyed my stay, the only drawback being the location of the hotel which is a bit remote from Dublin's centre even if it's a 20min walk to Temple Bar.",5,2014,05,04
206,Exquisite Modern 5 Star !,"I stayed in The Marker last November when visiting Dublin, not usually a fan of such architecturally moden hotels I must admit I am already planning my next visit !. I adored everything about this hotel, the staff made us feel so welcome and our every need was catered for. Our room was just exquisite and the best bathroom I've ever experienced at a five star. You really get the feeling that no stone has been left unturned. Regarding the food...... Perfect !, and I fell in love with the roof terrace and it's sublime cocktails. I will be booking this hotel on every trip to one of my favourite cities.",5,2014,05,02
206,"Very good, just a smudge away from excellent","Just stayed here for 4 nights, attending a conference at the nearby convention center.    It is an excellent location---just a 5-10 min walk across the bridge to the convention center, with many excellent restaurants (esp the comfortable but chic ely bar next door) and pubs within easy walking distance.

The rooms are large, well appointed, and the staff is extremely helpful.    The breakfast buffet is very good.   I liked the sitting areas/informal meeting tables set up in the lobby.    Free, excellent wifi throughout the hotel.    

A few complaints that in a lesser hotel would have meant a harsher review:
- wake up calls for both my colleague and I were 30 minutes late (we arranged them separately).   The following morning when there was no wake up call requested and she then got one at the previous day's original time.
- The charging station in the desk (very nice feature) wasn't working and the staff member showed me how to wiggle the station's main plug under the desk to get the electricity flowing.   I had to do this several times during the trip.
- shower drain was slow
- Rooftop bar was closed most if not the entire time I was there (at least Mon-Wed night)

Most of this should be able to remedied rather easily and I would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,05,01
206,Amazing hotel - just a shame the rooftop bar was not open!,"The Marker is a really lovely hotel - beautiful rooms with 5 star amenities and the friendliest staff I've ever encountered at a hotel! We stayed for 2 nights for our anniversary and loved the hotel.

There are a few good restaurants nearby and the theatre next door (we saw War Horse and that was brilliant - we got last minute cheap tickets by walking in in the afternoon and asking at the ticket office). It's about 20 minutes walk to Temple bar area where we ate both nights of our stay - was fine for us to walk but can imagine being a bit of a pain if it was raining! Would have thought taxis are cheap though. 

The pool / spa area were fantastic - quiet in the week too so once we had the whole area to ourselves.  A good spot for relaxing!

The only downside was the rooftop bar wasn't open at all during our stay (or was only opened for a private party). Otherwise would have given the hotel 5 out of 5 as everything else was brilliant! Apparently it's not open that much in April or earlier months due to weather (particularly in midweek), but when we were in Dublin it was quite warm so would have been nice to go up there... Bit of a disappointment as we were looking forward to that and it was one of the reasons we splurged on The Marker for the 2 nights. 

We didn't have breakfast in the hotel but instead had pastries / bagels from a deli type place called Fresh (I think) a couple of hundred metres away (literally a couple of doors down from the bar on the corner opposite the hotel). Would recommend this for those wanting somewhere different to go - we sat outside one day when it was sunny in the morning and saved a bit of money compared to breakfast in the hotel. ",4,2014,04,30
206,"Great location, excellent staff","We selected The Marker as it was somewhat cheaper than many similarly starred Central Dublin hotels, and we were interested in staying in this part of the city that was new to us. We weren't disappointed. Our last stay in a much longer established hotel on Stephens Green last year was disappointing- it was quite shabby in places, whereas The Marker is brand spanking everywhere. Location is lovely, and we took Dublin Bikes along the River up to O'Connell St and Grafton Street. Staff are extremely helpful. My only gripe was that we couldn't access the stairs (were told they were for emergencies only!) and had to take (and wait for) the lift to our bedroom on the second floor. However Stephan the Guest Relations Officer who was in touch within 48 hours of our stay tells me this was an error and has promised to look into it. And he is going to internationally post me back my left-behind phone charger for free! There's a hotel who cares what its customers think.",5,2014,04,28
206,One of the best hotel experiences!,"This is a great hotel! The price is great for the quality of service. I has two rooms and was placed on the sixth floor. We checked in early and the staff didn't even comment about it! Our rooms were impeccable with comfortable beds and great shower pressure. The bath products provided were lovely. Our daaily make up of the room was perfectly done, and I loved their turn down service.

The staff was the real gem of this hotel. I was always greeted by several staff when I entered the lobby. The porters were quick to assist with luggage. The breakfast staff was efficient (breakfast was good too). 

We were able to make it up to the rooftop bar over the weekend. I found it disappointing that the bar was closed most days for functions, but we had no problem getting in on the day they were open. The staff immediately sent us up the elevator, ahead of non-hotel patrons. The service, which included hot water bottles and blankets, was great. They definitely made me feel special.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and would only stay here in Dublin. The taxi ride to the action in town is under 10 euro and there is always a taxi available.",5,2014,04,28
206,Lovely modern hotel,"Very helpful staff, large rooms ( no real outlook).  Great breakfast, fab sky bar and it's only downfall is the 12 minute walk up Pearce st to get to trinity college ( what a drab street that is).  However you eat and drink so much in dublin the walk is good for you, or there is the hop on hop off bus stop rot outside",5,2014,04,28
206,Perfect,"My cousin and I stayed in the marker last de ember for one night only.
From the moment we landed we were met by friendly, courteous and professional staff from the front desk to the dining room. 
Food was delicious, and we got up to the rooftop bar to see the city lights.
Also we had cocktails in the bar after our food, which were lovely. 
Breakfast next morning was a feast which we had in our room, yet again presentation, and high quality of food was wonderful. 
I'm returning in October to treat my student son to a night in a real 5 star hotel. 
As I said it is perfect.",5,2014,04,28
206,Great service and lovely spa,"I visited the Marker hotel last week for a spa day and enjoyed it immensely. The staff are excellent. The facilities are top notch- nice pool, Jacuzzi, sauna and steam room. It is nice to have these facilities on offer in a city centre hotel. My companion and I did not stay over but enjoyed our spa experience and then sampled some cocktails in the hotel bar afterwards. The decor is a bit too modern and clinical for my liking and I think the bar and lobby area lacks in atmosphere as a result. However, overall I was impressed with the friendly and efficient staff and would recommend the Marker hotel for a spa day!",4,2014,04,28
206,Brilliant Stay,"We stayed at the hotel after attending a show at the adjacent Bord Gais Theatre. The quality of the show was more than equalled by the brilliant experience we had at The Marker.
The standard of service provided by the friendly and helpful receptionist was continued throughout our stay. The staff took time to enquire about our needs and were genuinely interested in what we had to say. In particular I would mention Sandra and Raj.
All the meals we had in the hotel were of a high standard.
The quality of the building was impressive, with our room being both spacious and luxurious.
I would highly recommend this hotel, which truly merits it's 5 star rating.",5,2014,04,28
206,I CAN NOW CALL IT A 5 STAR HOTEL,"I stayed in the marker hotel earlier in the year, and it was awful to say the least. Myself and my partner gave the marker hotel a second chance over the weekend and we were pleasantly surprised  .on arrival we were looked after very well and shown to our rooms without any hassle.We received a full explanation of how the room operated(heating, a/c,minibar etc) and we're told if we needed anything not to hesitate to ask. We went down to the swimming pool which was quite busy but still enjoyed it. It was very clean and we'll looked after compared to last time. We were going out to an event in Dublin that night and the marker went that step extra and printed off directions for us. I will definitely be returning to the marker in the future and recommending it to all my friends and family. It is clear to me now the first time we stayed in the marker hotel was just a bad day at the office for them. I would like to say a special thank you to the male receptionist(Robert I think) and to Stephan, general manager.",5,2014,04,28
206,Superb,"Friendly staff, efficient & unobtrusive service, interesting, fresh and tasty food in the Brasserie. Ideal venue for a meal before attending the adjacent Bord Gais Energy Theatre: we will definitely go back. 
Will definitely be back.",5,2014,04,26
206,Great Hotel But Not On The Night of a Big Event,"I arrived at this hotel on a beautiful, sunny Spring day and that showed it's beautiful dockside location off to perfection.

The check in staff and bellman were  friendly and my room was well-appointed and spacious.

However, there was a big awards ceremony in the hotel that evening. I was having business meetings in the hotel bar/cafe when a hotel manager came up to our table and asked us to move to make way for the function guests who had yet to arrive.

I wasn't best pleased that I was moved mid-meeting and it lead me to wonder whether the design of the hotel, limited it's ability to host big functions alongside it's normal business guests.

I would still come back here but would check what was on first.

",3,2014,04,26
206,Making its Mark in Dublin,"We had only a one night stay, mid week, to attend a show at the splendid Bord Gais Theatre across the plaza from the hotel.  It was too little, but enough to inspire us to conjure another opportunity to return.  
We had a top floor room with great views of the plaza, the canal basin, the pleasure boats, the Daniel Libeskind designed theatre and the pedestrian and bicycle traffic below and the Dublin mountains in the distance.
This hotel, which opened in April 2013, is still in the full flush of youth but maturing well.  It has a complex geometric feature ceiling through the entrance foyer, reception, bar and dining areas.
On a brilliant sunny April day the light filled the entire front of the building and helped the spirits to soar.  
Our room which had a king sized bed of the utmost comfort had plenty of space and features one should expect from a 5 star property.  The bathroom was huge, fitted for access and use by a wheelchair user and with a wet room shower.  Two negative observations here. The only lighting was entirely at ceiling height and this meant that there was poor lighting of the hand basin area.  Also, the shower head was at approx. eight feet high and a good stretch for a tall man.  It was not possible to alter the direction or flow of the water.  This gave a sense of lack of control and could be an issue for some customers.  
We ate in the bar area and while our burgers were substantial and service was speedy and professional it was not exceptional food.  Breakfast, however, was excellent with a wide choice and good replenishment of depleting items.  The breads were great.  
There are excellent staff at every level; professional, attentive and good mannered.  In fact, I feel that the staff are the really exceptional feature of The Marker.  That, and those views of course.  I have to get back soon!",5,2014,04,26
206,Class and Excellence,"I had reserved The Marker based on other reviews and it was our first port of call after a long flight from Australia and we were not disappointed. The exterior of the building is modern and in keeping with the new residential and office buildings of the Grand Canal and the reception, bar and brasserie are light, airy and welcoming with a really interesting and funky ceiling.  We had a lovely lady check us in (we were early but no one batted an eyelid) and were offered a room on the 6th floor facing the canal.  We were advised that the room did not have a bath, but we did not want one anyway.  The rooms are modern and spacious with a glorious king sized bed and fantastic pillows.  The room is well appointed with plenty of rooms for large suitcases and has a good sized TV, robes and tea and coffee making facilities as well as a safe.  My only minor criticism is the lighting in the bathroom and while it looks ultra modern, because of the dark floor and wall tiles it is actually quite dim.  Very difficult to shave properly even with the magnifying mirror.  The floor in the bathroom is heated and also has a heated towel rail. The toiletries smell and feel beautiful.  There is a turn down service which is very welcome, down to a couple of mint chocolates on the bed.  

The hotel has a swimming pool, sauna, steam room and spa.  The spa was out of action during our stay, but not a big bother.  Both the sauna and eucalyptus steam room were particular favourites of mine and come highly recommended.  The hotel offers spa treatments if you are so inclined. 

The hotel was kind enough to organise a couple of tours for us and I mentioned in passing that I thought the AC was faulty and I had been cold.  An electrician promptly came up to the room and showed me the correct operation (there had been nothing wrong with it) and that evening an additional heater was in the room.  All this without me asking for it - that's exceptional service.

We didn't avail ourselves of the rooftop bar due to it being closed over Easter as well as for private functions.  Nor did we have breakfast at the hotel as I though the price a little expensive.  It turned out that it might have been worth paying the extra, as there were so many things closed or opening very late due to Easter.

Given the hotel's location on the Grand Canal, it is about a 15-20 minute leisurely walk to O'Connell Street and Grafton Street, however it is not a long way and we willingly walked it several times a day, along the Liffey river.  

Dublin itself was not as picturesque as I imagined, so getting out of the City on various day tours made a lot of sense and I loved the Irish countryside and landscape.  Spring did not seem quite as progressed given it was getting to late April and it was cooler than I was prepared for. The wind off the water really blows and creates a chill, although we were lucky and had a couple of sunny and clear days.

Should I return to Dublin again, I would definitely stay at The Marker again.  I really loved the place!",5,2014,04,22
206,"Great, but the food wasn't ","We stayed Saturday just gone in a superior room, the room was fab, more or less what I expected. The man working behind the reception, Robert with the dark hair, was very accommodating and very nice. Unfortunately the good was a little to be desired, lamb was over cooked , and the desserts where bland. Also the breakfast was self service, I thought this very strange for a 5 star hotel. ",3,2014,04,22
206,Superb service,"I booked a superior room for 3 adults but when we arrived we were upgraded to a larger room to give us more space. This was just one example of the wonderful service we encountered from arriving in our car to be met by a porter with a trolley for our luggage to valet parking.The hotel is modern, trendy and spotlessly clean.My son and husband were wowed by the gym and large pool.We had early evening drinks and tapas on the roof top bar which was great if chilly but we were provided with blankets and it was worth it for the views and ambience.The luxurious bathroom was fab and our bed very comfortable. We ordered a box of cronuts which were delicious.I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,04,21
206,Impressive,"Everything about this Hotel was great, arrived at 4pm and my room wasn't quite ready yet, reception told me it would be ready in 10 minutes, I was running late already so they kindly upgraded me. Staff so helpful, fantastic bar staff and the roof top bar was amazing, they give you blankets when it gets a little cold. The rooms superb, loved the shower. Can't wait to go back this summer.",5,2014,04,20
206,Amazing !!,"If your in doubt on where to stay the marker hotel has it all ! From the moment you walk in you just feel the place has class ! 
Bedrooms good size - lovely bathrooms ! 
Food/ drink little pricey but what do you expect in a city hotel ! 
Staff - couldn't do enough from the moment we arrived.
Spa- beautiful place..
Thanks for a lovely weekend the marker.",5,2014,04,20
206,Brilliant from start to finish!,"We arrived here to stay last sat nite at 4pm ish. We had booked the valet parking so pulled up outside and the porter was quick to greet us and take our car away and offer help with luggage. I did think 20 euro was steep for parking but anyway we booked. 

We went inside and were greeted by another lovely chap who asked our names and quickly went off to return with our check in sheet, so check in was instant! Brilliant! Reception staff were nice also. AND we got a complimentary upgrade to a canal view room! SUPERB!!!

We went upstairs and the hallways are chic and well sound proofed, there was also a nice fragrance. Entered the room, again lovely fresh scent and light airy room with view of the lovely canal. U could just sit here and people watch, was lovely! Bed huge and so so comfy with loads of pillows :-), bathroom was huge with a huge separate shower and bath with light marble and big sink AND UNDERFLOOR HEATING :-) nice! Someone come into room after we went up and left a dessert which is a nice touch !We didn't hear one thing in the room and got a fab sleep!

The location is a good bit from temple bar area so you couldn't walk in heels ladies, but the taxi fare was reasonable at around ten euro average, and the hotel almost immediately sorted us with one when we went to reception.  The hotel itself was absolutely buzzing when we left for town at around nine so you could enjoy yourself here likewise if only the drinks were a lil more reasonable! The rooftop bar was stunning, we went up there around 6pm and the sun was out so was like we were in another country And very relaxing and lovely ambience, I was also given a blanket should I take a chill! Fab! Prices were overpriced tho, I got a strawberry daiquiri which I felt disappointed with, it wasn't well presented nor tasted great so I felt this wasn't value for money at 13.50euro. Tip is drink Guinness or bottled drinks as they were pretty much same price as anywhere else in dublin x

Hotel is right next to bord gais theatre and I only wish I had know it was on the doorstep as I was too late to get seats for warhorse!

POOL IS STUNNING, this was the reason I picked this hotel as wanted a pool and I was not dissapointed, it is so relaxing with steam, sauna, jacuzzi an large pool. One little thing is the jacuzzi wasn't warm enough, it was only few degrees higher than the pool. Changing rooms have good shampoos, proper hair dryers and swimsuit dryer BUT NO STRAIGHTENERS? I was shocked, most places have these now, even nite clubs! Lol 

Check out was quick and easy. 

Overall I loved this place and the staff make the place, those guys need a pay rise they were great! I WILL DEFFO BE BACK!",5,2014,04,15
206,"Wow, 5* for The Marker Hotel and your wonderful staff","I enjoyed a 1 night stay on Sat last, a girlie get together and we wanted to stay somewhere special - and wow are we glad we choose The Marker. Loved the location, the rooms and the fantastic rooftop bar where we had the opportunity to get some unique group photos - but most of all we loved the attention from every staff member, so attentive and polite and welcoming, ensuring we really felt treated like royalty. Only downside was that we didn't have time to enjoy the spa, so i will be returning soon. Thank you everyone at The Marker.",5,2014,04,14
206,Marker Hits the Spot with APE staff !!!!!!,"Dont be fooled....  By APE I mean staff that are Attentive, Professional and Enthusiastic!!!!!  Every staff member that we met over our two-day stay exhibited all of th eabove in bucket-loads.   I've stayed in better buildings, with more gimmicks and with ""posher"" furnishings but the Marker stands out for its staff.   Whatever you're doing Marker Management please keep it going....

Other that its staff the hotel has a lovely lobby area, great bar / bar food, excellent brasserie, nice roof-top bar and spacious rooms.  The location is in the new docklands area and it remnded me of being in Barcelona with its chic plaza and well designed buildings and streetscapes.

The only tiny frustration that we had was that even thjough the room had a nice I-Phone charger / lamp it didnt allow us play any music from our own device, neither could we play a CD...  Otherwise head for teh Marker becasue you wont be dissappointed!!",5,2014,04,14
206,The bar has just got higher - in every sense !!,"Just returned from a one night stay in The Marker - having stayed in all the 5 star hotels in Dublin I really feel this has set a new standard
Friendly warm welcome at the front door - excellent service at the front desk and a beautifully modern bedroom. If this wasn't enough there is fantastic rooftop bar where you can sit back enjoy a drink and see Dublin from a completely different perspective.
If you staying in Dublin this is a must!!!

206,50th birthday in dublin,"We have just returned from a relaxing 2 night stay at The Marker,and can honestly say it was the most wonderful and personal feeling hotel we have stayed in and we have stayed in the top hotels in Scotland and found THe Marker a more personal and relaxing experience. The staff made us both feel that we were the most important guests in the hotel. Form the little touches of the most amazing chocolate cake and card in our room for my husbands 50th birthday. To the tour of the spa to show us where everything was and the wonderful buffet breakfast.To the very comfortable spacious room with the full length windows.we could not recommend it highly enough and hope to return in the future.",5,2014,04,08
206,Lovely Hotel,"We have just returned from a stay at the Marker Hotel and felt compelled to write and say how lovely the hotel is. The service from walking through the door to breakfast is second to none. The hotel is around 25 minute walk from Grafton Street and all the sights which can be reached by walking along the river for us was this was pleasant as the weather was good.
Sadly we were unable to book a table for dinner at the hotel as it was fully booked until after 9 (a bit late with a 10 year old) but we ate breakfast this morning, something for everyone with a great selection of hot and cold food, the waiting on staff can't do enough for you! We would definitely return to this hotel if and when we return to Dublin.",5,2014,04,06
206,One Night Romantic Stay in Dublin,"An absolutely superb experience.  I brought my wife to the Marker for our wedding anniversary and the staff really made the stay a memorable event.  The staff on check-in wished us a happy anniversary and this was followed with a cake and card waiting for us in the room.  We had tickets for a show in the Bord Gais and having pre-booked the valet parking with the hotel, the time from arrival, check-in and over to the theatre was literally a few minutes.  We didn‚Äôt have time to experience their pool and spa, opting instead for a lovely breakfast served to our room.  Avoid the queue at check-out and opt for express (just hand over your room key and they‚Äôll email an invoice). The car was ready out front with bottles of mineral water left for a much needed re-hydration!  Thank you to all the staff.",5,2014,04,06
206,One of my finest hotel experiences,"We stayed here for 2 nights in December and I have to say it was a great experience. The service was perfect from start to finish - I had an awkward early check in and a few other requests that were all met without issue. The room was spacious and comfortable. We didn't use the restaurant but the breakfast was excellent as was the bar - lovely cocktails and bar nibbles.
The hotel is located in a great area of the city, close to the Bord Gais Theatre and 15 mins walk from the city centre. I would recommend to anybody travelling to Dublin to stay here if possible and I'm looking forward to my next stay already!",5,2014,04,05
206,A shining example of fantastic customer service,"Exceptional customer service, from absolutely EVERY member of staff in this hotel. My goodness, so many hotels, shops, bars and restaurants could learn a thing or two from these people. And having spent my life in the service industry, it is rare to experience service on this scale - bar that experienced on Concorde. Even (don't mean to patronise) the lady who came to do the ""turn down"", was absolutely charming, professional and lovely. I came to look round Dublin, without realising that the hotel was infact a destination in itself. I ate at the restaurant, which for pre theatre menu was great value at euro25, considering you pay euros 15 for a pizza express pizza in dublin - not a cheap city - and the food was really great. The room was modern, luxurious, beautiful bath and separate shower, huge bed to die for, and if you can afford it, definitely worth upgrading to a corner room/suite - stunning views over the canal. Hotel right opposite the contemporary beautiful theatre - we got some last minute warhorse tix - 10 mins before the show started, so great to tie hotel and theatre. Lovely area on the waters edge 15 min walk to main dublin city area. Bike hire for euros 5 (like boris bikes) for 3 days - right outside the hotel doors, so easy to go for lovely cycle around the city or along the canal. Rooftop bar is stunning and very very cool - a must - mostly outdoors with amazing views over city and out to sea. The spa and pool are certainly worth a visit - all very lovely, large pool, modern, and relaxing.  This hotel knows how to do ""cool"" - it is cool, but without being pretentious. Think of the Sanderson or ME hotel, but with better service. Here, they are utterly charming. Final tip, you can easy jump on the Airlink bus from the airport, and get off at the first stop - I think it's the one for the congress centre (Canal basin). Just walk over the river (bridge), and down one block, and you are there at the hotel, for a mere 6 euros! Without a doubt I will be back, and will be recommending it to all my friends and family. It was a toss-up between this hotel and the Four Seasons, and I am so glad we chose the Marker. I leave the hotel tomorrow, after 4 wonderful days - a truly wonderful stay in a great hotel.",5,2014,04,04
206,Nice Hotel,"We stayed in this nice hotel for 7 nights in January 2014. It is a new hotel and clean.
Nice quite location. The city center is 15-20 min walk (beside the river will be a very nice walk).
Staff very helpful. Nice bar in the lobby.
Room is spacious, bathroom very clean, with nice heated marble flooring.

The only negative was the breakfast, not that much choices, though the place is nice beside the lobby.",5,2014,03,31
206,Perfect location for bird gais theatre,Great location. Lovely room. Nice spa. Robert the concierge was v helpful. I will definitely stay again if I am going to the theatre. Only criticism would be that some tables in the bar are not suitable for eating-too small and too low down. And the brasserie was not open for lunch so the bar was the only option.,5,2014,03,30
206,Love love love!!,"Where to start? 
The Marker has it down to a T. 
You know what makes or breaks hotels? The little things - they all add up. Well all the little things The Marker Hotel do add up to one amazing hotel. 
Mugs for tea in the room, slippers, robes, selection of tea, coffee plunger, modern tv, a CLEAN welcome note in the room (pet peev of mine is dirty room directories) bathroom amenities that smell amazing. Every little thing in the marker comes together to make one amazing package. 
Also I love that there is plenty of staff & how every single member I walked by said hello& smiled. 
As I said, it is the little things. 
Keep it up!",5,2014,03,29
206,The best hotel in Dublin?,"First time to stay here, had read reviews which were all good. Hotel looks fabulous from outside and is even better inside. Reception (Robert) was very welcoming and couldn't have made check in any better. Rooms are fantastic and really well kitted out with great views of grand canal square. Rooftop bar is a real treat and the staff are very very efficient and friendly, even hot water bottles for outside!! Breakfast was simply delicious and the waiters were ever so attentive. Finished off by valet Attendant leaving bottles of water in car for journey.
Strongly recommend this hotel, it may not have old school opulence of Merrion, Shelbourne or Westbury but it's modern style with superb staff and attention to detail put it in the same class as these standard bearers.",5,2014,03,29
206,5 Stars,"From the moment you arrive at this hotel you are swept away into a world of comfort where the staff are your friends and only wish for you to be happy.

We stayed one night for a trip to ""Warhorse"" at the theatre next door in March 2014.

The room was huge, well set out and had a great view out on to the square. The bed was massive ( as was the bath!) and very comfortable. Nothing had been overlooked - all the usual hotel Faye was there - TV, ironing board, tea and coffee as well as seating area, mini bar and safe.
The marble bathroom was glorious with a huge bath and separate shower. Sadly the bath robes and slippers were too snug for me, though.

The long dark corridors make you feel peaceful and quiet and as such I never heard any noise to suggest I was in a hotel, during my stay.

Breakfast was lovely - your usual hot and cold buffet with an enormous selection of choices.

On our return from a walk we found the bed 'turned down' - slippers laid out and chocolates on the pillows - a lovely touch. I was surprised though that any sign we had been in the room had been removed. A small piece of litter removed from the bin and the chairs straightened. This made me feel like a guest in my own hotel room if you know what I mean ? 

All in the Marker Hotel must be the best Hotel I've ever stayed in. Well done and I hope to return.",5,2014,03,28
206,"Modern, foody, great staff !","I found this hotel on Trip Advisor. When away on business on my own i prefer modern hotels. I like fast Wifi, great service, a good restaurant, and high quality well-equipped rooms. I booked a Deluxe room, a deep-tissue massage in the Spa, & valet parking.

From the moment i arrived the whole experience was just incredible. The concierge who met me at the door was a giant of a man, & quite possibly the most polite and helpful man i've ever met. He took my car keys, issued me a ticket, & introduced me to the receptionist. Check-in was quick & easy, again from tremendously polite and helpful staff. I found the room easily, and it was exactly as i'd hoped. Modern, spacious, well-equipped, nice view. A beautiful contemporary bathroom, with marble everywhere & a walk-in shower (i do value a great shower). The TV had a huge choice of channels, & also other features such as iPad mirroring, & music on demand. 

I then went to the Spa. Again, brilliant polite helpful staff. The massage was excellent, the facility was great, & i headed to the restaurant suitably chilled.

I was met by the restaurant Manager, a young Dutch 'food-lover'. Service was beyond impeccable, the food was amazing, great wine (which he decanted for me !!), & i was treated to some samples of other things on the menu through the course of the evening, as we discussed the world of food in general. I would go to this restaurant even if i wasn't staying at the hotel ... it stands-up as a great restaurant in it's own right. I really can't praise it, or the staff enough !",5,2014,03,27
206,A Contemporary Hotel in a historical city!,"Travelled 7000 miles from Hong Kong to see Derren Brown Infamous show at Bord G√°is Energy Theatre located right next to the hotel!  The room is spacious, clean and with very high ceiling; the food at The Brasserie was delicious but most amazing was Derren Brown having breakfast at same restaurant with us; I believed he's staying at The Marker too!   
I would recommend this hotel to anyone who's traveling to Dublin.",5,2014,03,27
206,5 Star Experience,"We stayed here last weekend, and we had a wonderful time there. From the moment we arrived at the set down space to the time we departed from there two days later, the staff could not have been more friendly and genuinely helpful.

We were met by Stefan who took our bags and brought them to reception. Before he parked our car for us, he introduced us to Robert at reception, who checked us in with the minimum of fuss. Stefan was on hand to bring our bags to our room, and gave us a guided tour of the room. A brief summary of our stay included Roof Top Lounge on Friday night. It was cold and  wet so we couldn't stay outdoors. It was quiet therefore, and staff were winding down, but just as last drinks were called, a large group arrived in. If the staff were disapppointed at this, they certainly didn't show it, and served the new guests with the same enthusiasm as if it were at the beginning of the night. 

We used the Spa and Wellness Centre on Saturday, and again the customer service experience was excellent. We ate there on one night, and the food in the Brasserie was top notch. Breakfasts on both mornings was varied and plentiful. When hot plate food became empty, they were quickly replaced by the staff. Check out was very efficient, and Stephen the doorman had our car was ready for us when we left, together with two bottles of mineral water for our trip home. 

The overall view of the weekend, was a modern, spotless hotel, excellent food, nice bar atmosphere, but the biggest impression left was the quiet efficiency, and friendliness of all the staff members that we encountered. If this is what 5* service is, then the Marker has it in abundance. Other tourist establishments should visit, and learn a thing or two about customer service here. We would highly recommend a stay here.",5,2014,03,26
206,Stop looking and stay here,"I have stayed in a lot of hotels and worked in a few too and I would just like to say that this hotel is The BEST hotel I have ever stayed at.  When they say 5* this is what they mean.  The staff are friendly, helpful and keep asking if there is anything they can do for you.  The rooms are so clean you can eat food off the floor.  Breakfast is decent but on the pricy side (‚Ç¨20 per person) .  We also had dinner at the restaurant and it was very strange food, wouldn't really recommend eating there.
The pool, jacuzzi and saunas are all amazing, clean and well kept.
The beds are very comfy, I think it's memory foam, and I think all the double beds in the hotel are king size.
The location is a little outside of town but it's only a ‚Ç¨7 taxi ride to the centre and there are also busses.
Would recommend this place to anyone and would never stay at any other hotel in Dublin.
Just amazing :)",5,2014,03,24
206,Amazing roofbar,"I live around the corner from the hotel and have been in for food and drinks to the lounge area a few times with my friends, work colleagues and husband. The hotel is very beautiful and modern but staff always very friendly and welcoming. Finally tried the roof bar of the hotel last Friday with my husband, had always imagined it was very difficult to get in but were surprised when the lady by the lift told us that there was space available. The views are breath taking and the seating area inside is small but very comfortable as it was very cold outside. The service was the highlight of our evening. Our server Alan was very attentive, friendly and couldnt have done more for us to enjoy our stay and recommended 2 excellent cocktails which were worth the ‚Ç¨13.50 prices. Looking forward to visiting back during the summer when its warmer but that dosent take away from the warm service. Thank you.  See you soon.",5,2014,03,24
206,Can't find fault,"Stayed here on a business trip; the hotel is modern and thoughtfully designed. Guest rooms are spacious, with comfortable beds and large bathrooms. Darkened corridors add sense of style, strangely. Facilities for business travellers in-room are good, with large desks and free wi-fi. The only hotel I've stayed at to provide complementary chocolate cake (in upgraded room at least) as part of first night's turndown. I know people who would come here for that reason alone! Staff were friendly and helpful. A pity that the rooftop bar isn't open during the week as the lobby bar is a bit impersonal. Not able to comment on hotel dining facilities as we ate out but the conference catering was a very good standard.",5,2014,03,22
206,Amazing Hotel!!!!,Arrived to the hotel today and from the moment we stepped out of the taxi the treatment was 5*. Given a stunning superking bedroom (room 431) with large bathroom with modern fixtures and fittings...perfect and bed is sooo comfy! Truffles as part of turn down service are to die for! It is also my friends birthday and they brought a beautiful complimentary platter up with chocolate cake and chocolate writing wishing her a happy birthday! It's the little touches that make this hotel a gem! Looking forward to sampling the food and bar and will repost! Very impressed so far!! ,5,2014,03,21
206,Missed Opportunity at Marker Hotel,"Lovely staff and a beautiful hotel. Great admiration for the interior designers really cool.

We were not told about the need for the hotel card in the lift. We got separated I thought I was stuck in the lift until another guest rescued me.

Dining times are confusing on the website. I rang the hotel prior to our visit and was told that we could not eat after 5 pm. My husband booked a table at 7 pm. on the website and received email confirmation. Staying there we realised in the bar you cannot get food after 5 pm. but you can go to your room and pay for room service and get food! This is not 5 star standard. If you are a resident you should be able to get what you want when you want it.  In the restaurant last time to eat is 7pm.

We also paid ¬£50 sterling for the hotel car park for two days. I think this is ridiculous. 

We went to dinner. I ordered oysters there were none left in stock. I ordered chicken wings which arrived cold and particularly tasteless.

Incidentally, my husband's meal was lovely‚Ä¶a chicken dish. 

I told the waiter about my cold tasteless food. He said the manager will talk to you now. THE manager was clearly visible in a black suit and ignored me. In fact, the waiter who was very attentive until the cold chicken complaint completely ignored me too after this point.

The bed was exceptionally comfortable. Fantastic room!

The pool was to die for a very relaxing experience we visited the sauna and the steam room also. 

First morning they ran out of bacon. We did get bacon‚Ä¶eventually.  First morning my breakfast was cold.  Second morning sausages were off. I did not complain as I thought there was little point due to the previous night and the lack of concern about my cold, tasteless chicken wings.

I did not want any discounts and the fact that nothing was offered is irrelevant.  I wanted the dinner/breakfast service to be of an acceptable standard which it clearly is not. There  were no visible signs of poached or fried eggs on the breakfast trolley.  Nobody told us we had to order them.  So on the second morning I had a plate full of breakfast ordered a fried egg and it took at least five minutes.  Poor organisation skills here and very disappointing. My breakfast needless to say on the second morning was also cold apart from the egg (which was lovely). 

Is this a five star hotel? No it definitely isn‚Äôt.  I think price wise it was ok apart from the car park charge; but it is a four star venue for all of the above reasons.

Would I stay here again? Yes‚Ä¶because of lovely staff (apart from the dining room manager) and fantastic innovative design of rooms.   Clearly I would eat elsewhere as the dining experience was not up to standard.  The poor reaction of the dining room manager was the most annoying and my faith in the overall service could easily have been restored by an appropriate reaction from him. 

I would also question a car park charge prior to my next stay.

Limited meal choice on dinner menu was evident also.",3,2014,03,21
206,Just visiting the lobby for supper,"This is a fab location if you are going to Bord Gais theatre and you want to have an informal sit down meal in the lobby of the hotel which is both luxurious and comfy with many different types of seating to suit your needs. The waiting staff are pure 5 star level, so it makes for a very nice experience. The kitchen closes at 10pm so we just got in there after our theatre around that time and my husband was ravenous so they allowed him to have something and I saw them do it for about another 2-3 tables after us that came in so I like this kind of flexibility. Having said that in line with the times that the shows finish in Bord Gais they could probably do with opening this until at least 11pm or so as I think they would still have a steady flow as lots of people coming and going still at that time we were there. Of course being 5 star, the prices are extortionate, I actually can't believe they have a cocktail menu that costs as it does in the current climate averaging from 13.50 to 20.00 and they are possibly the smallest cocktails I have ever seen in my life. Unless you are loaded you actually wouldn't be able to have many rounds of drinks and you can see a lot of people come in for one and are gone which again is something they need to look a, as if they were more reasonably priced I think people could afford to stay there longer but again of course they are looking for a certain type of clientele and therefore missing out on a whole pool of people who are coming from the theatre but don't want to spend that type of money after paying such high prices already for their tickets, excellent location of course and we didn't get the chance to experience the rooftop bar as it is only open Fridays and Saturdays or something like that.",4,2014,03,21
206,One night business trip,"Superb. For 5 star they know what they are doing. Turn down service is top. Service level purely from the greeting, assistance and the ""hello's"" provided made one feel special. Location is also very very good. Excellent size bathrooms and super shower",5,2014,03,20
206,Beautiful Hotel,"Stayed in The Marker for the first time in March 2014 - stunning room and great service. From the second you enter the hotel you know you are entering a different class of hotel. 

We checked in around 12 noon and were shown to our room on the first floor. Every aspect of the hotel is done to a high specification, inlcuding the lobby, the hall way to the rooms and the resturants. The room itself was huge, even though it was 'Basic' by The Markers standards. The bathroom was stunning with the heated floors, bath, shower and large feel to it. 

In short, I couldnt fault the hotel as it was flawless, and having a 5* hotel in Dublin for around ‚Ç¨180 per night was excellent value in my opinion. Would stay there again without doubt.",5,2014,03,20
206,"5 Star Hotel, 5 Star Service","Hotel is located in Canal Square which also houses a number of small cafes, a Spar etc and is an easy 15/20 minutes walk to Grafton Street.  Plenty of staff across the hotel.  I found the reception staff and breakfast servers the best during our stay.  Unfortunately, the staff at the Roof Top Bar not so good as my husband had to wait at the table a good 10 mins before having to signal to someone he wanted to order a drink as no one had approached us for service. This happened again when we wanted to order a second round.  In a 5 star hotel, you expect that the staff will anticipate what you want before you even ask for it.  Did this ruin our stay?  Absolutely not, was the only blip the entire stay so it was annoying as it would have been a flawless overnight stay from start to finish otherwise.  

The room was beautiful.  I loved the deep Cadbury purple carpet and the bathroom was a place that you could stay in all day.  Floor to ceiling grey marble with separate full bath and a shower that would easily fit 4 people.  Lovely quality shower gel, shampoo etc  The bathrobes were extremely rough and I believe had been washed numerous times without fabric softener.  No big deal though.

Breakfast was excellent, plenty of selection and unlike the Roof Top Bar, the staff couldn't service the table enough and always seemed to be close by if anything else was required.  Breakfast service was the best we received during our stay.

The hotel is very stylish, very modern but I do think it could benefit from a little more personality in the bar area just beside reception.  But this is just a personal note.

I found the location of the hotel very refreshing as it seemed to be an emerging hip new area to visit.  I would definitely stay at The Marker Hotel again in the future.",5,2014,03,18
206,"Beautiful hotel, excellent staff","We stayed here for 2 nights for our anniversary and it was a wonderful, luxurious stay. The check-in service was excellent, the staff were attentive and friendly. The room was lovely and the spa is fantastic. Can't recommend this hotel enough.",5,2014,03,18
206,Excellent,Top class hotel. Dublin s finest . Rooftop Bar is a must see. really good and attentive staff. will be back. The hotel itself is really modern and there is a really nice vibe. The grand canal square area  is a great new area.,5,2014,03,16
206,Remarkable!,"Had a really lovely stay in The Marker Hotel. Service excellent, rooms super. Very nice decorating, crispy modern look. Good food. Very nice situated in business district. On walking distance of the center of Dublin.",5,2014,03,16
206,Such Luxury,"We only stayed here one night. We were seeing a show in the Bord Gais Theatre and this hotel is seconds from the venue. 
The first thing we noticed was the number of staff. There are a lot of very friendly staff here. They all say hello as they pass and if you stand still for a second or two you'll be asked if you need anything. 
Our room was beautiful and very clean. Lots of gadgets to play with, iPhone charging station and array of plug sockets. And very importantly for some people a 'real' 'full sized' hair dryer. The bathroom is great with a really good shower. 
The breakfast next morning was a buffet but definitely one of the better ones we've had. Lots of local, Irish and artisan products were available and were displayed beautifully. Even the pat of butter on the table was from a small local producer as was the muesli, yoghurts etc. 
The fire alarm went off twice while we were there. They were having an issue with it! Even that gave the staff a chance to show how friendly and organised they were. 
All in all we will definitely stay here again. You're 20 minute walk from the heart of Dublin city but you feel like you're in European capital with all the new buildings around Grand Canal.",5,2014,03,16
206,Fun in the City,"So, not the cheapest hotel we've stayed in but for a hotel of its class in the middle of a city definitely a good one. 

We were attending a concert at the O2 and the location was great. 

A Dublin Bike stand is just opposite the hotel and is a great way of keeping the taxi budget down whilst getting around the city. 
Plenty of eating places around so you are not locked into eating at the hotel, with Herb Street for breakfast highly recommended.

On the whole a fine hotel in an ideal location for what we were after

",5,2014,03,16
206,This is business trip!,"I stayed here for 2 nights during a business trip in Dublin.
It was my first time in Dublin and I adored this hotel since the first sight.
Really amazing! And what a great staff!
The position is also really strategic to visit the centre of the city by walking just 15/20 mins.
I think there is nothing better to relax in the Spa after a long business day and order your room service.
I loved the queen size bed and the pillows!!!
There is also free wifi in all rooms and common places.
I'd like to come back here with my husband because this hotel is really amazing!",5,2014,03,15
206,Top Class Hotel,"Excellent hotel, spotlessly clean, friendly staff if somewhat pricey. Lovely wellness centre with nicely heated pool. The breakfast is very expensive for what you get. The rooms have everything you would need including an absolutely lovely bathroom.",5,2014,03,15
206,pure relaxation,"every single min spent here was perfect, fantastic service ... room was so clean and tidy, modern and had a really amazing view that allowed us to people watch into the square. Roof top bar was AMAZING .... all round amazing stay",5,2014,03,14
206,"Good, less good and bad","The good: great location, easy walk to the centre of Dublin, nicely furnished room, one of the nicest hotel bathroom i have seen, good value valet parking.
The moderate: we were seated on swivelling chairs for dinner, something that should not be allowed in a good dining room. food was ok though. For breakfast, as the waitress sat us down she listed all the breakfast items that cost extra such as porridge. Only later in the breakfast when I mentioned that I was surprised that they only had scrambled eggs did she say that doing fried eggs would be no problem.  
The bad;  When we turned around from checking in, we saw that our airplane carry-on baggage that we had left just behind us was firmy in the hands of a bellhop who insisted on accompanying us to our room, wheeling our small carry-on bag on his trolley. Once in the room he insisted on giving us a lecture about the facilities --  This is the window and this is the view and here is the television and this is the remote control,...on and on... . Seriously it went on for a full five minutes and we were of two minds whether to burst out laughing or to physically kick him out of the room. Anyway we tipped him and he left. I find this type of behaviour intensely annoying. A polite 'would you like some help with your bags'  would be sufficient.  This was tip-whoring, definitely not a five star service.",3,2014,03,13
206,"Great staff, Issues with the Rooms","When you walk in this hotel you believe you are in one of the finest hotels in Dublin.  The grandness of the lobby, the architecture and the service of the staff was all remarkable. 

All the staff were kind, friendly and over the top with service.

The room, which was an upgrade king suite was a solid 7 out of 10.  
It was nicely appointed, but not stellar, for an upgraded room, the size was still quite small and not suitable for 2 people to work effectively.
The bathroom although having the highest quality finishes was poorly designed.  The stand alone shower leaked every day and leaked significantly below the doors.  We had to have the cleaning crew come the first day there was so much water. 
The electrical also had an issue, again the crew came to repair and replace.  

The service was stellar on these items, but it was still frustrating as we stayed a week and every day we had to use towels to clean and hold back the water.

Found it pricey, but everything in Dublin is pricey.",3,2014,03,13
206,Great new find in Dublin,"Stayed here with a large group. 
Nice sized rooms and well thought out for business travel with a nice touch of modern feel. 
Hotel staff is very friendly and organized. 
In a quieter part of town than we normally stay in.   A nice change. 
Walking distance to the 02 arena and a 10 minute walk to heart of Dublin for shopping if needed. 
Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,03,13
206,Superb hotel ,"Had the pleasure of  visiting the marker hotel on sat 8th march . A party of 3 , we decided to have dinner there before a show . Staff are amazing , so friendly , mannerly and the service can only be described as 5 star . Before dinner we went up to rooftop area, outdoor heaters , blankets and hot water bottles are provided if you feel chilly . Snacks are also provided with your drink . Great views over Dublin . Dinner did not disappoint , great value for a 5 star hotel , special pre show deal ‚Ç¨25 for 2 course ,‚Ç¨29 for 3 course . Silver service , polite staff explained the dish we each chose and exactly what was in the dish , they know their stuff . Fab !!! . The marker management should be commended on how they train their staff . A hotel that is just one year old in April will be around for a long time . Superb !!!  ",5,2014,03,11
206,Excellent Hotel,"Myself and my sister stayed at The Marker this weekend as we were attedning a concert at The O2.  It was fabulous.  The service from the point of pulling up to the hotel to the second we were leaving was impeccable.  The rooms are beautifully decorated, cocktails expertly made and the food was superb.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Spa aswell.   I know where I'm staying for any future trips to Dublin.",5,2014,03,11
206,The best hotel in Dublin,"Just back from our third stay at the Marker, there is no better hotel to stay at in Dublin, beautiful decor and rooms, a stunning roof top bar, staff are super friendly and helpful they really make you feel welcome, spa is fantastic too. We stayed this time for my fathers 70th birthday and they even sent a birthday cake to his room! Little things like this make a difference. I really could not rate a hotel higher. 6 stars if there was such an option. Thanks to everyone at the Marker for making our stay so enjoyable again.",5,2014,03,09
206,Excellent choice for a business trip,"I have only praise for this new hotel, about to celebrate its first birthday.  From the time I arrived, the service could not be faulted, the room was first class and I enjoyed the restaurant, lounge bar and fitness room.  I look forward to an extended stay in warmer weather and the rooftop bar, pool and the spa treatments.  There are good bars and restaurants within easy reach. Very convenient for the airport and well positioned for the business district - what a find!  Looking forward to my return visit.",5,2014,03,06
206,Third time staying and will be back.,"I stayed in The Marker not long after it opened and again some months later. On both of those visits I was impressed with the quality of the building, the rooms, the bathrooms but felt something was missing from the overall experience of being a guest. The service seemed a little too cool for its own good, I never really felt engaged with the hotel. Back there this weekend just past and my view now is that The Marker really is finding its stride. From the moment we arrived, everything felt like it was more genuine, more relaxed. A mix up with our booking (I had requested two twin rooms and was given two doubles) was sorted out in minutes with no fuss whatsoever. The rooms are very well appointed and the bathrooms are amongst the very best in the city. The staff treated my young nephew and nieces with adult level respect and every time we entered or left the hotel we were acknowledged. One of the porters went out of his way to go to my car to retrieve my mobile phone and deliver it to the room. Rooms service was delivered quickly and to a very high standard for room food. At a busy checkout, additional staff offered guests the option of express service, allowing us to leave immediately. I've stayed in all the other five star hotels in the city but for my money The Marker is the one, notwithstanding that some people will prefer the city centre locations of The Shelbourne and The Merrion. Personally I just love this whole area of Dublin.",5,2014,03,03
206,"Close to perfection, and closer to the city than you think","From start to finish, this was an experience of the highest quality.  Check in was friendly and efficient, and got us to our room a good two hours before official check in time.

The room was a good size, a large and very comfortable bed, and had a high quality shower, TV facilities, and free and good quality wifi.

We used the gym and pool in the Spa and Wellness area.  A good range of machines in the gym area, and a beautiful pool, jacuzzi, steam and sauna room, which used the space well, and was extremely relaxing.

Then to the famous Rooftop Bar, buzzing on a Saturday afternoon.  It was a chilly evening, but blankets and hot water bottles took the bite out of the open air section.  Drinks weren't cheap, but the cocktails were simply delicious.

Down to the main bar for food, and while a club sandwich and fish and chips isn't haute cuisine, they were perfectly prepared.

In the morning, we didn't go for the breakfast, instead indulging in some tasty cronuts, before enjoying the gym and pool some more before the generous check out time of midday.

Throughout all of this, the service was excellent.  The style and design of the hotel is sleek and modern, and it adds significantly to the life of the area, with the bar and restaurant busy with people going to or coming from the Bord Gais Theatre next door.

It's easy to think that this is not really in Dublin City Centre.  However, it's very close by in reality - a 10 minute walk would get you to O'Connell Bridge.  There's also a lot of choices in the immediate area for food and drink if you want to leave the hotel - though frankly, I'm not sure why you'd want to.  Just fabulous.",5,2014,03,02
206,Don't stay here if you can avoid it....,"As a Dubliner who is now living in the US, I regularly travel back to Dublin on business. The Marker is next to my office so I was excited when it opened and was one of the first people to stay at the hotel. The hotel is not awful, you're not going to run out disgusted or move hotel outraged but please don't mistake this hotel for a five star hotel or a hotel in the same league as The Shelbourne, The Four Seasons or The Dylan. I travel all the time and recognise five star service or even good service when I see it and unfortunately the vast majority of staff have no experience in the service required for high-end hotels. For example, when I was trying to get a taxi in the rain the doorman told me to walk to the bridge and shrugged his shoulders. When I returned 3rd time at the hotel they didn't welcome me back, they assumed it was my first time at the hotel, isn't it on the screen in front of you that I have stayed there a few times? especially that I stayed there the first week of opening? Also, the 'suite' which was nearly ‚Ç¨300 a night was a corner room with a rubbish couch, I could see no difference between this and the regular rooms. The hotel bar and restaurant areas are awfully cold and unwelcoming, this is a matter of taste of course but don't expect luxurious surroundings. If you want value for money, this is not the place. I've switched to the Shelbourne now, right in the heart of town for the same rate or less than this uncomfortable and unfriendly place is offering...",2,2014,02,26
206,Excellent facilities and location.,"Attended a course facilitated at the Marker Hotel last month. It was absolutely fabulous, the hotel is very modern and wonderfully positioned. Its a nice 15mins walk from O'Connell st or a 20 mins walk to Grafton st. The conference rooms are very well set out, wonderful coffee machine, fab pastries.  The staff are so friendly and professional. We had a tour of the bed rooms, will definitely hope to stay there in the near future. 
Lunch was excellent, beautifully presented and served in a lunch box.",5,2014,02,26
206,Five Star but also friendly,"Stayed one night seeing a show at nearby theatre.from arrival to leaving was impressed by the friendly standard of service. Hotel 15 minute walk to city centre because we were going to theatre had only a bar snack tasty and quick service.After show wanted to have a drink in roof bar but it was full settled in lobby bar when I member of staff remembered us came over to say there was a place now for one last drink on the roof empressed by that level detail.
One flaw the wet room/ shower flooded the bathroom floor design over practicality but rest of room comfortable.
Check out a little slow but not hotels fault people should remember what they put on their room.
Must commend young Dutch gentleman who was on the bar last night and now on duty again very helpful and friendly  a great advertisement for the hotel.
Would recommend it especially if attending the theatre.",5,2014,02,24
206,Short and sweet anniversary treat,"We stayed here for 1 night to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary . We were going to show in the Board gais Energy theatre so it was perfect .
I don't think I can complain or comment negatively on 1 thing , everything was perfect . The check in staff asked if we were staying for any special occasion, i told them it was on our anniversary and after we got to our room 2 glasses of champagne arrived courtesy of the hotel . It was a lovely tough . 
The room was a great size as was the bathroom and it was immaculately clean. It is bright and modern and has a real contemporary feel but is not cold .
We didn't eat in the hotel but had drinks after the show and the service was very good. this is a 5 star hotel and you do pay 5 star prices for the bar etc but I found the room to be good value. 
Check out was very busy when we went to leave but all the stay were on hand and were working as quickly as they could to make sure no one was waiting too long and in fairness to them everyone was leaving at the same time .",5,2014,02,24
206,Another visit to heaven,I was so lucky to have February visit to The Marker Hotel.  The room was again was perfect for some rainy days in Dublin.  The marvelous breakfast each morning was a highlight from the greeting to the service.  I needed Gluten Free and my GF toast arrived promptly at the table before I went to the breakfast Buffet.  I am not a tea drinker so I truly savored the cappuccinos  and the poached eggs.  What a way to start the day.  I can't wait for my next visit.,5,2014,02,22
206,Classy,"This hotel is wonderful, clean and trendy. The rooftop bar was closed which was a shame, ad it was Friday night which was disappointing. The food and cocktails are to die for. Free WiFi throughout which all hotels should have, but sadly don't. Breakfast was gorgeous. The pool and spa is beautiful, the only gripe I would have is that there are loungers beside the pool, but it was way too cold to sit there. They had water available beside the pool which is a great idea. The bed is soooo comfortable! My complimentary paper of choice was hanging outside my room which is a lovely touch. Robert on the front desk was so helpful ad friendly. Your car is put away for the night (20 euro) and dropped to the front door in the morning. Really pleasant experience...thank you!",5,2014,02,22
206,"Great place to stay, bit out the way","We stayed here for a mini city break in November 2013 and while the hotel was lovely and clean with a HUGE bathroom and bedroom (and bed... huge bed!) it was a little further away from the city centre than I thought which was okay as we often walked in and then taxi'd back for about ‚Ç¨8-10. 
Staff on reception were helpful and told us how to get to places we needed to get to (bars/guiness factory etc). 
The roof bar was amazing and even though it was cold we enjoyed a few pre-dinner beverages. 
We didnt eat in the hotel and considering the price was suprised that breakfast is not included. Not sure it is worth as much as they charge but as I have nothing especially to complain about that is just a personal opinion. 
it is a very new hotel so in good condition, hope it remains to this standard over time. 
Would most likely stay somewhere more central next time unless I needed to be in that side of town.",4,2014,02,21
206,INCREDIBLE,Without a doubt one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in from checking in to our spa treatments and relaxing by the fabulous pool. The room was spotless cannot be faulted and the service was outstanding they really made us feel special and we cannot wait to go back. Amazing value for money and after one night there I felt like a new women. The roof top bar was so romantic and the room service food and breakfast was delicious. I would not stay anywhere else in Dublin.,5,2014,02,19
206,WOW!!!!,Sunday Drunch was a wonderful experience. Food superb - touches of michelin star style. Very attentive service by all the staff. Wonderful way to spend a grey Sunday. One complaint music was terrible - DJ maybe needs to diversify. Surely Sunday should be 'chill out' time!!  Will be back very soon for the food.,5,2014,02,18
206,"Excellent hotel, friendly staff","I enjoyed a 3 night stay at The Marker. Overall a very pleasant experience - helpful staff, very good service over breakfast, a good selection for breakfast and good coffee. The pool, hot tub and sauna facilities are very good and well maintained. The hotel was very clean. My only minor complaint is I prefer hotel rooms to have solid flooring (e.g. Marble or Tile) - but the Marker rooms have carpet. The bathroom was gorgeous as well - full sized shower and separate bathtub. Will stay here again when visiting Dublin.",5,2014,02,17
206,Superb hotel,"Stayed at marker and got a show in at bord gais which was evita! Arrived at hotel and had booked valet parking, my keys were handed over and I had nothing to worry about. Ina at reception was superb and nothing was to much trouble, she even printed my theatre tickets for me. Hotel itself is just superb and the turn down service was a lovely touch. Our room was big wit deadly view of grand canal and shower bathroom was beautiful too , 5 star all the way.",5,2014,02,16
206,Gorgeous Hotel,"I booked this hotel for a long weekend break for my boyfriend and I to celebrate his birthday and Valentines Day. We both agree with the other reviewers- the hotel is a proper five star experience, yet it manages to make guests feel comfortable and at home and we settled in very quickly. We were very pleased with our room, which had views across the square towards the Bord Gais Energy Theatre ( and the very funky light stalks which are multicoloured at night). The bathroom was gorgeous - big bath and separate shower and the whole hotel is decorated in muted greys and blues, with the odd splash of colour. We had a very good breakfast on our first morning - others have commented on the prices and it's true that the Marker isn't cheap, but food, drinks and service are all five star standard and I wouldn't expect to count cheapness amongst the many benefits of staying in a luxurious hotel. We also ate in the Brasserie for the special Valentines dinner, complete with wine pairing and a champagne cocktail (passion fruit - yum!). The food and wine were both wonderful and the atmosphere very friendly. We thoroughly enjoyed it. The spa is a must as well - my boyfriend and I both had Indian head massages which were amazing and the pool, steam room and jacuzzi area is lovely too. The weather was terrible on Valentines Day but we had a lovely day relaxing in the gorgeous Marker and genuinely didn't miss being out and about. If you have a hankering for some luxury, met with friendly Irish charm and a comfortable atmosphere, go to the Marker. You won't be disappointed!",5,2014,02,15
206,WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER BEEN IN,"On arrival to The Marker Hotel we were greeted with a very, unorganised front desk. Our rate for what was going to be a two night stay was ‚Ç¨378 euro, not including breakfast, plus a ‚Ç¨100 deposit for the minibar that was in our room that we did not want.we paid in full but later decided we could not afford the 100 deposit as that was our Valentine's Day dinner money. I went back down to cancel our second night(tonight) and was approached by an assistant manager who was unfriendly and unsympathetic to our situation. We cancelled anyways and we thought it was sorted. It was not. Nobody bothered to tell us that it takes 5 WORKING DAYS  for our money to be transferred to our accounts,  that's ‚Ç¨289 out of pocket at this stage. When we accepted what had happened we decided not to let it ruin valentines day completely we  went up to our room to discover the superior king room we booked was not so superior, more like a double room in any 3 star hotel.the toiletries were limited and nobody had explained how to use anything eg.heating/air con. We then went on to use the pool facility, which was not very clean, the steam room had an over powering scent of menthol to disguise the foot smell. My over all impression of the hotel was that it was trying to be something it clearly is not, I have stayed in other 5 star hotels in ireland and believe me they are world's apart. Myself and my partner were highly disappointed and would not recommended this hotel to our worst enemy.",1,2014,02,15
206,Excellent restaurant for Theatre goers,"We arrived at the Marker Hotel cold and wet after a stormy journey from Waterford
Table was booked in dining room for 5persons and the lunch and service was excellent
Lunch was22eu for 2 courses and worth every cent. Would reccomend this hotel  to any foodie",5,2014,02,14
206,Great Dublin Hotel,"Stayed in the Marker Hotel last Saturday as I was attending a show in the Bord Gais Theater  next door.  The hotel really did  lived up to my expectations. F,rom the moment we arrived we were pampered. The staff were wonderful. The evening meal was delicious but expensive for what we got.  The Breakfast was wonderful everything was so fresh and tasty.  If I did have to deduct  a point it would be the cost....it was a little pricey .   Parking was also a nightmare .  if you are thinking of staying make sure to book your parking spot when booking your room or you will end up paying ‚Ç¨15 per night for the car park next door.  All said and done would I stay there again , Hell yes,  it was wonderful.",5,2014,02,12
206,The Best of hotels,Went for dinner with a friend who was staying there and absolutely loved it  No complaints whatsoever. tThis is what a hotel should be. Absolutely wonderful greeting and setting is something else. If you have the money go spend a weekend in Dublin at this hotel,5,2014,02,11
206,Good hotel terrible parking and drinks way overpriced.,"Stayed here at the week end, check in early room wasn't ready which we understand.
But my the parking is a major problem you have to pre book parking limited spaces so had to park in the public car park next door  30‚Ç¨ a night rip off the hotel should really look into this problem.
Arrived back after the match to have a drink at the bar, limited seating crazy being a saturday had to wait 20 mins for a seat.  Next the shock the price of the drink exorbitant  9.50 for a glass of wine.
Breakfast was ok not 5* coffee cold had to ask for a second pot cold too.
Also the door men not interested  in you unless you wanted a taxi or had valet parking.
Reception staff excellent.",4,2014,02,10
206,Amazing weekend. 5-star experience!,"We stayed at The Marker hotel for our anniversary weekend. It was wonderful!! The room was nicely decorated, very spacious, modern and clean as a whistle. The bathroom was my dream bathroom. Massive bath tub and then separate glass encased shower. Bathroom was as big as a bedroom you find in most hotels!

The breakfast was delicious and offered a wide spread of choices. Following a great meal every morning, we'd venture down to the spa, which was an absolute delight. Again, clean as a whistle, modern with first class amenities. I didn't want to leave! I left Dublin feeling totally relaxed and rejuvenated -- and this is mostly due to The Marker!

I was most impressed with the level of service we received. All of the staff was so warm, welcoming and helpful. Every interaction we had was a positive one. 

I highly recommend this hotel and I can't wait to go back for another visit!!

P.S. Another amazing touch. When we got back from walking around the city one day we had a 'Happy Anniversary' cake waiting for us in our room. 10/10. This hotel makes you feel so special!",5,2014,02,10
206,Pretty Much Perfect!,"Wow, stayed here this week (Feb 14) and had to report back on it.

Beautiful looking boutiquey hotel, in a great location in the very well rejuvenated docklands in Dublin.  
(It's directly opposite a fab theatre)

I booked via their website last minute for a work event being hosted there.

Off to a good start when the doorman rushed out with a brolly to rescue me and my bag from the torrents if rain. 
Perfect check in (all the staff had wonderful manners and smiles on their faces for the duration of my stay.

My room (507) did not disappoint. Beautifully appointed twin room (2 double beds, top quality bedding)
But oh, the bathroom!! HUGE! 
Super cool, wall to wall light grey marble, complete with underfloor heating (nice touch), Villeroy and Bosch huge 'pebble' sink, enormous shower and bath (I took a bath even though I didn't need one!!)

I visited the Spa as soon as I'd unpacked, and apart from a glitch with their online booking form, this was also fab. I visited at 4.30pm and was the only person in the pool (a huge subterranean design, black slates again floor/walls etc... very stylish. Steam room was fab. All immaculately clean.
I had the hour long back massage/facial treatment (about 65 euros I think)... wonderful!!!
Definitely make time for this if you can.
(It had a large well appointed gym too, but I did not use it)

Breakfast was buffet style, with great choice of fresh fruit, cereal, toast, croissants etc as well as full cooked breakfast.

Can't recommend this place too highly, for a business or family stay whilst in Dublin. I'll be going back for sure when there is no hurricane blowing outside hopefully!
Amazing hotel.",5,2014,02,09
206,Nice but not amazing,This is a very modern hotel .Im back having spent last Saturday night there but I am not crazy about it.Its not five star in my opinionThe rooms are beautiful with great comfortable  beds  and with wonderful bathrooms but I was not keen on the bottom floor at all.It was like eating your breakfast  in a corridor and had a cold feeling .The bar was very comfortable with great if very pricey cocktails.Cant comment on the roof top bar area as it was very stormy and we didn't go there.The breakfast was not great...everything was very cold and slow service.Cant put my finger on what is lacking in this hotel but there no atmosphere in it.Wouldnt rush back...,4,2014,02,03
206,recommended modern hotel,"stayed for one night, mainly offices nearby not a great neighbourhood for walking but only about 10 mins in taxi to city centre, interesting building and architecture, good service in general if at times a little over formal, bedroom was well designed and furnished, swimming pool spa was very nice, didn't have dinner but breakfast was pretty good, a little soulless/cold but i think that's the case for most modern hotels with an open plan design, overall I would recommend for a modern break in Dublin city and definitely worth trying",4,2014,02,03
206,Fantastic experience - an absolute pleasure,"Just had to share my fantastic experience staying at the Marker Hotel straight away, I'm still smiling as it was an absolute pleasure from start to finish. My first impression was I thought it was such a beautiful design and lovely location. At reception, Robert couldn't have been more helpful and welcoming. Walking down the corridor to our room, I loved the design and sensed something special awaited us in our room, I wasn't disappointed, the bathroom was stunning, the shower was a generous size and strong jet with easy temp. control. The bath l was a good size too and the toiletries smelt amazing. The chocolates and slippers, the tea making facilities(which took us a few minutes to locate as it's discreetly place behind a white panel, the robes, the bed, wow the bed was definitely a hightlight, a king size but so wonderfully comfortable, teamed with pillows that I meant to ask where they were from because I had a wonderful night's sleep. We tried the pool and the wellness area, again staff were very welcoming and the facilities top notch.We were there for Le Drunch and the food again, was the highest standard, I couldn't speak after tasting my creme brulee, it was heavenly.The breakfast, it wasn't the biggest buffet but it had top quality on offer and everything tasted good. Unfortunately the rooftop bar was closed for a private function when I was there so I can't comment on that and I forgot to try the Cronuts but I don't think my stay here could be easily topped, just everything was such a high standard and felt luxurious.I've stayed in other 5 stars before and always found something to disappoint but the marker truly deserves it's 5 stars as it's a real treat to stay there. Left smiling and would absolutely recommend.",5,2014,02,03
206,As Good as it gets.,Recently visited the marker for my partners  birthday and what a wonderful experience from the warm welcome at reception to the professional departure. I contacted the Manager on duty ( Gary ) and asked if there was anything he could do fot a small b day surprise and within minutes we recieved a lovely fruit plate and desert with a candle. This was way beyond my expectations so thank you. One slight down side was the room service food. It was pretty average. Amazing pool and great rooftop bar but be patient as drinks take a while. See u all again soon,5,2014,02,01
206,Loved our stay at the Marker Hotel,"This hotel opened April 2013 in an unbeatable location. The service is top notch - professional, warm and genuinely wanting to make your experience special. The rooms are large, modern and nicely appointed. It was our anniversary and we were surprised with a beautifully presented dessert, half bottle of wine and card with anniversary wishes in our room. Many of the staff remembered our names throughout our brief stay. 

The rooftop bar has a spectacular view of Dublin and is a beautiful outdoor space. We highly recommend the Marker Hotel.",5,2014,02,01
206,cold and lacking atmosphere,"I stayed here just before Xmas with my mum and I was expecting more from a 5 star hotel. The bed was extremely comfy and the hotel was very clean but something was lacking. While some staff were extremely friendly, others were pretentious; ignoring us whilst saying hello to the business men in suits. I feel the hotel focussed more on form than function and although extremely modern, the lighting was really poor (applying make-up was next to impossible) and the general layout of the room was frustrating ( no plugs near an extremely large mirror for example). I know it may sound petty but in a 5 star hotel, these shouldn't be issues. Overall, despite no huge flaws, I felt uncomfortable in this hotel. Also if you want a taxi, ask reception to arrange one for you! There are lots around but many have an arrangement with the hotel. we jumped into one that was free and although we were guests in the hotel, the doorman then told the taxi driver he had a hotel fare. The doorman then audibly asked the driver to ask us to get out, but changed his mind when another cab turned up!unacceptable!",2,2014,01,31
206,My wife's birthday. ,"We were there just before xmas to celebrate my wife's birthday. 
We were lucky enough to get a table for 6 on the roof.
By the way big thanks for Ethan and Peter for the perfect night and the hospitality. 
We felt so special and all the friends were so happy in the end.
Both food and service were good and professional. 
Definitely will be back soon.

206,"Clean, moderd & comfortable hotel in Dublin","Stayed for 2 nights on business - chose this spot due to colleague recommendation and proximity to my office in Dublin.  The staff was welcoming and professional.  Rooms were very clean and comfortable (the bed sheets could have been slightly higher quality & I would have liked more pillow options).  However, the lovely bathroom was a nice surprise: heated marble floors, a huge soaking tub and wonderful Malin + Goetz products.  Would definitely stay again if I returned to Dublin.",4,2014,01,30
206,Gorgeous,"I visited The Marker for the first time earlier this month for a girls weekend away in Dublin and it was just sublime!

The rooms were done to a very high standard and the bathrooms were heaven, heated floors, walk in shower and a bath I could have stayed in all day given half the chance! The reception staff in particular were great, very helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Unlike some front of house staff they really took the time to engage with us and have a chat rather and weren't standoff ish in anyway at all.

We didn't eat at the hotel but we sampled a number of drinks from the bar! Wine list was great and our waiter did a fine job in recommending what we should have based on what we fancied and the cocktails were fab! A little pricey but in that kind of setting you kind of expect to pay a little more.

The roof top bar is definitely worth a stop, the views over the docklands was great and even though it was freezing and we were outside, we had a heat lamp and fresh blankets to keep us toasty. 

Next time I'll make sure to visit the spa and the leisure facilities which I didn't get to this time round. Well worth a visit.",5,2014,01,29
206,Outstanding,"We stayed at this fabulous hotel during the All-Ireland in September 2013. The staff were excellent and the facilities top notch. We particularly enjoyed the swimming pool which is a decent 20m from what I recall. The rooms were luxurious with in room mirroring from your tablet to TV and secure Wi-Fi. I particularly liked the ceiling to floor window which gives a great few of the refurbished Docklands area and the Bord Gas energy theatre. The underfloor heated marble bathrooms were fantastic. The patio bar on the top floor was great craic if a little adventurous with Irish weather. The bar in the hotel lobby pours a better pint of Guinness than the storehouse at St James' (perhaps its the new piping??)

In short if you can afford to stay here you won't regret your booking particularly if you are seeing a show across the road in the theatre. The only thing to be aware of is that this 5 star is out of the city centre. Realistically it's a five minute taxi journey to Dublin City Centre. This contrasts to the Westbury (excellent) and the Fitzwilliam (mediocre) both of which have central locations i.e. their doorsteps are at the centre of the city but generally they do cost more. Enjoy!",5,2014,01,28
206,"Amazing stay, impeccable service","We had a fantastic stay in the Marker on Saturday night. Room was gorgeous, food ( both dinner and breakfast) was beautiful and service was second to none. A truly beautiful hotel with staff who are willing to go the extra mile ",5,2014,01,27
206,Fabulous stay,We stayed here for our anniversary the weekend refresher deal. From check in to departure they could not do enough. The pool is one of the best I have swam in in the world. The treatments in the spa were seriously good Anya the beauty therapist was amazing. The room service was great the only thing I could fault was there is no bubble bath in the bathrooms and with a bath that big would of been nice they did offer to go to a shop to get some tho. Would stay again in a heart beat. Thanks to all the staff to making our anniversary so special.  ,5,2014,01,27
206,Fantastic Hotel & Staff - Can't wait to go back,"We recently had the pleasure of staying with you in the Marker Hotel - Saturday the 25th of January.
From start to finish, I can only describe it as exceptional in every facet. It was the first time my wife and I had been away for a night since our daughter was born, which is nearly 2 years ago at this stage.
I had been looking for a nice hotel as a treat for the night and I contacted several other hotels, which I would have perceived to be in the same bracket.
Although we were working off a budget, there were a number of factors which helped in making a decision. I hadn't heard of the hotel (much to my embarrassment), the hotel web-site looked very good, had been given very excellent reviews on trip advisor / booking.com / hotels.com etc. Most importantly, however, having contacted all the hotels directly, it was The Marker that stood out with regard to the manner in which the initial query was dealt with, to the booking itself. I spoke with Alison, in reservations, and she wonderful to deal with - from explaining the offer involved and informing us that we would be upgraded based to a Superior room on same (also it was a B&B rate) - very professional and personable. As a customer I came of the phone feeling like it was going to be special and that we were going to be looked after very well. We were not to be disappointed.
From the moment we arrived in the hotel on Saturday afternoon (early) everyone we encountered was so helpful, friendly (which is not always the case in 5 star hotels) and there also seemed to be a great atmoshere amongst the team. There was a sense that the staff working there knew they were working somewhere special and were taking great pride in making it even more so.
Of the staff we had the good fortune of meeting all were excellent, can only remember a few names- Barry who looked after our car and give us a tour of #310, Gary at the front desk  - who checked us in and out on our departure was professionalism personified. We also met Killian & the team in the Roof top bar - a great experience. Also all the staff we encountered in the Brasserie (for breakfast -fantastic food) and the Bar were very polite, helpful and friendly - Godfrey in particular. The food (and wine) was excellent - Smoked salmon & Nutri Box.  Often forgotten are the staff, we as guests, don't get to see that much of -  Housekeeping in this case provided some lovely touches - turn down service, slippers etc. We also received a lovely treat (mini Tiramisu) in the room from the Guest relations team, The views from our room were magnificent - also the cleanliness and room facilities. Swimming pool was beautiful - had to go in twice as I dropped the key for the locker at the bottom of it!!!!
Apologies to the French gentleman who retrieved, packed our car and left two bottles of water for us on check-out- I  didn't get a chance to thank him.
Once again we would like to thank you and your team for making our night in Dublin a truely memorable one. 
A fantastic hotel with superb staff.",5,2014,01,27
206,"Very, Very Good","We stayed in The Marker over the New Year.  Arrived early, around 13:00 and our room was ready. Upgrade to a corner suite, great room, with a fantastic view over Grand Canal Dock. Dinner in the Brasserie restaurant, late night cocktails in the roof top bar and a sumptuous breakfast the next morning.  The staff we so friendly and helpful, they made our stay amazing.  A definite ""Will be Back"".",5,2014,01,24
206,Well worth spoiling yourself!!!,"We stayed here for one nght only as we were attending a show in the Bord Gais theatre. The location is excellent, literally 40 seconds walk from the theatre. From the second we arrived, we were greeted with warmth and welcoming smiles. The staff are excellent, especially the doorman and waiting staff. The rooms are luxurious, and although I was initially worried about the lack of lighting in the bathroom, there was a large mirror in the bedroom, and a stand alone mirror on the dresser, which enabled me to move nearer to the window for applying makeup, (very important.) 
I was worried about noise from outsdie the hotel and theatre after closing time, but we didn't hear a sound, obviously very good sound insulation from the windows.  The roof top bar is worth a visit, although we couldn't site outside due to adverse weather.
We were impressed with the toilitries in thebathroom, and on enquirying if we could purchase them, we were given free samples, and the supervisor took my email address to send on a list of stockists to me.  Very good customer relations!!
 We ate dinner in the hotel resteraunt, and the food and service was perfect. Our waiter Ethan deserves a special mention, he was polite, attentive, informative and very pleasant.  Breakfast offered a wide choice of pastries, fruit, cereals, and hot food, all of which was fresh and plentiful.
Our valet returned our car with a smile, and we were given water for our journey home, a nice little touch!
If I had one gripe, and its only a little one, is that there is no residents bar. On returning after the show, the bar was completely full, people having a drink before they ventured home. Once the staff realised we were residents, we were given seats immediately, but it would have been nice to have a queiter area to relax after the show.
All in all and excellent hotel, well worth the extra costs!",5,2014,01,21
206,Worth every penny,"We cannot wait to go back to the Marker. It is FANTASTIC. We stayed for one night between Christmas & new year. From you arrive until you leave, the service is great. Valet parking, friendly reception, great food in bar, gorgeous breakfast but the pool is out on its own. It is really one of the best pools ever. Our four year old loved it. It's a beautiful hotel with 5 stars, great staff but not at all ""stuffy or snobby"". It's right beside The Bord Gais Theatre and lots of others restaurants & bars. We are saving already for our return visit. Can't wait. Well done all in the Marker",5,2014,01,20
206,Theatre Stay,"I stayed in the Marker on thursday the 9th January, it was a christmas present from my son. we were upgraded to a deluxe room, it was stunning very very comfortable, we had pre theatre dinner in the Brasserie restaraunt, it was delicious and very cost friendly, the staff throughout the whole hotel just could not do enough for you, the bedrooms were roomy and even a heated bathroom floor. we had the best time ever. we went to see Wicked in the bord gais energy theatre, its right beside the hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel, just fantastic",5,2014,01,16
206,Great addition to the Dublin hotel scene,"Having spoken to a friend who stayed here shortly after it opened and experienced evident teething problems, I decided to wait a bit before booking our first stay.
We had already visited for drinks on the roof terrace and liked the look of the hotel.
The rooms are a nice size and very comfortable. We experienced none of the minor issues that my friend had and have to compliment all staff that we dealt with on their warmth and professionalism, Plans meant that we were unable to eat in the hotel on this visit but will definitely try at least breakfast next time.
I'm tempted not to mention the spa in the hope that it will still be almost empty on our next visit but have to say it is the best we have found in Dublin. 
If visiting be sure to explore the local dockland area which has now been transformed into a highly credible night-life zone in this our favourite city.   
Will return.",4,2014,01,15
206,Wow @ The Marker,"Spent a 1 night celebration event at this hotel, which is situated in a part of Dublin, that I am not familiar with.

The hotel is literally  right beside the Bord G√°is Energy Theatre and is a bit hard to find without sat nav assistance.
First tip is to pre book valet car parking and you will have no problem arriving at he front door of the hotel and also when departing.
The reception area is open plan, with bar area, reception desk and brasserie. (breakfast and evening dinning area)
Check in is fine and whilst our bags were brought in from our car, they were not offered to be brought to our room and we had a lovely room on the first floor and the lifts are located beside the reception area and you will need your room keycard to operate the lift!

Rooms are spacious, with a large bathroom, probably one of the best that I've stay in for a long time.

Spa area is very modern and luxury, though you need to have a spa treatment over ‚Ç¨60 to use the pool etc. 

Evening meal was bistro style and of good quality, but  choice was limited.

Staff at the hotel are very friendly,though few are local, so may not be able to give local information.

The hotel is 5*, which includes the cost of everything, but well worth a visit for a special occasion. 

Recommend a visit to The Ferryman pub, which is 5 mins walk from hotel for a true Irish experience.",4,2014,01,14
206,Loved it!,"Some friends and I spent 7 nights at this hotel last week. The service was excellent, we got great advice about places to visit in the city of Dublin.
The rooms were clean and pleasant. We had some problems with electrical outlets and air conditioning, but we changed the room and received free desserts for the inconvenience.
All the staff were very friendly and helpful.",5,2014,01,12
206,Fantastic,"I took my girlfriend for a two night break to Dublin for her birthday and stayed here. On arrival, despite being two hours early (hoping just to drop our bags and go kill time) we weren't only told our room was available but that we had been upgraded free of charge. The room and all the facilities within it were fantastic. There is literally nothing they haven't thought of.. the bathroom tiles are even heated to avoid cold feet and they'd addressed minor details like adding an extention lead to the hairdrier so you can dry your hair infront of the mirror. We literally only used the hotel for the room so couldn't comment on anything else, other than the more than curtious staff who were always polite and helpful. Unfortunately the rooftop bar was closed until the Friday evening so we didn't get to see what all the hype was about. The hotel is located in the former docklands and is far enough from the city centre to avoid the noise but close enough to be a comfortable walk, or cheap enough taxi home if you've sampled a few too many Guiness. The only slight niggle, which isn't the hotels fault but would have been handy to know is if you are leaving a debit rather than credit card behind for damages etc. then they take a 100EUR payment which is reimbursed when you check out, so unfortunately because we didn't have a credit card between us we had to spend our emergency money on the hotel.",5,2014,01,12
206,Funky luxury in the Docklands,"As an ex-pat I stayed here with my partner in Oct while on a short visit to Dublin. The Marker is a very nice experience. Valet parking was pleasant, check in was a little slow, but the reception area is sleek and modern and fun to hang out in and people watch. The room was very nicely appointed. Highlight for us was the spa area. Lovely pool with decadent slate grey tiles and a finnish sauna with black tiles and blue mood lighting. Very relaxing indeed and nice to see some originality. The cronuts weren't bad either. It's a bit of a walk into the city centre especially with the unpredictable Irish weather, but Docklands has great potential as a city precinct and this hotel will go from strength to strength. Definitely one of the coolest hotels in Dublin.",5,2014,01,12
206,Different treatment for different people,"Myself and my fianc√© decided to book into the Marker for a break before Christmas.  We stayed Saturday and Sunday the 7th & 8th of December and was really looking forward to it.
We arrived at the hotel at 3:15 on the Sat and checked in.  We were told our room wasn't ready and it could be over an hour.
We decided we'd go to the bar for a drink.
At 4:30 I checked on the status of the room with reception and was told it still wasn't ready and I was told I'd be put on a priority list and we'd get the next room.  We had to sit for a further hour until 5:30 when a manger from the bar approached us and asked us if we wanted a drink and I said no and I asked him was he a manager he said he was and i then explained we were waiting over two hours for our room and could he check it out.
He said to leave it with him and he came back 10 mins.  He told us our room was ready and to go to reception for our key.
When we got to reception there was a second couple also getting a key as they had to wait for there room also.  The receptionist who was with them apologised to them for the wait and gave them a complimentary upgrade on the house for their inconvenience.
We got a key, no apology and was given our room number from the second receptionist.
I emailed the hotel after and asked what was the difference from that couple to us and they chose not to answer the question but apologised for my experience and offered a complimentary upgrade the next time I would visit the marker.
I can tell you now I will never again set foot in the hotel as my money is as good as any body else's and I'm still awaiting why the other couple got preferential treatment over us.
We paid quite a lot of money for our two night break and lost out on 2 and a half hours in our room on the Saturday. 
Definitely not worth the money if there's different standards for different people.",2,2014,01,10
206,Rooftop bar is the place to go,"Love bringing friends here as the view is great and hotel is impressive in its architecture and location.

The drinks are not cheap but a fair price for the use of the bar and free nibbles thrown in. Excellent toilets as well.

Despite the ample number of staff serving, half the fun is seeing how chaotic service is despite management walking around with FBI style ear pieces :-) Every time I have been it takes 10 minutes to get served then three different waiters come to take your order within two minute intervals. Paying is nearly impossible. But it's fine as the atmosphere is relaxed and polite and you are there to enjoy the view in any case.

Blankets and heaters mean sitting out with hot whiskey on an autumn evening is more than possible! Also fun to watch the media types networking for any anthropologists out there. 

Worth a visit, especially about 4.30 before the office crowd descend on the place.",4,2014,01,09
206,Fantastic!,"This is my first review but I had to write it! The Marker is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in, the rooms, the service, and ambiance are all amazing! The thing that stood out the most was the service of the valet, they replaced our empty coffee cups and can of redbull (left in the car from the drive up) with two chilled bottles of water for our drive down. That along with the complimentary nibbles with drinks and having our slippers left out by the bed at night really gave a nice touch to whole stay!

Really worth a visit if going to the theatre or just popping to Dublin for a night!",5,2014,01,08
206,First Review,I never write reviews but I have to after spending a fantastic night last weekend at The Marker. My partner and I went up to see Wicked which was sadly a complete let down but the saving grace was the hotel and staff. A very warm greeting on arrival and wow what a room. Immaculate and modern. The bathroom was spotless and I loved the design. It was our anniversary and after a couple of hours there was a knock at the door and a beautiful small cake was presented with happy anniversary written in chocolate on the plate was a fantastic touch. Staff always ready to help and always saying hello. The roof top bar was fantastic on the night time and the pre show dinner i have to take my hat off for the chef. Good nights sleep and the breakfast had a good choice shame no white pudding. The only blip i can say was that there was a mini bar but no charges on the inside so when checking out there had been a 50 euro hold was refunded. After an explanation I was happy. Thanks again The Marker will have to pop up some time again,5,2014,01,07
206,I'll be back,"Overnighted here for an O2 event. Fabulous Hotel, very modern, clean and great staff. Food was excellent, room spacious even if AC not great, bed comfortable, bathroom bigger than some bedrooms I've stayed in elsewhere. Rooftop Bar was cosy and atmospheric but totally at the mercy of the ""atmosphere"" outside! Pre booked parking online with Q-Park for the Grand Canal Square multi-storey at half the cost of the limited concierge facility, the pedestrian access is literally right outside the Lobby. No sports on TV either in rooms or anywhere else for that matter, bad! Good location for Aviva, National Conference Centre, O2 or of course Bord Gais Energy Theatre which is right next door.",5,2014,01,06
206,Beautiful hotel - stunning views!,"We stayed during December for a night to sample the Dublin nightlife at Christmas - and we were not disappointed!  The room was huge and immaculate.  The bathroom was huge, offering both a bath and shower, and the bed one of the comfiest I've slept in.  The views from the room were stunning - as for the views from the rooftop bar - WOW.  It was a chilly December night when we ventured up to the bar and so we were offered hot water bottles and dozens of blankets which some of our party gratefully accepted - I opted to warm up with a hot cider which was delicious.  The breakfasts were tasty - especially the sausages!  The location is great, just a short walk down the water into central Dublin to wander around Temple Bar, etc.  We will definitely be back!!",5,2014,01,06
206,Disappointed,"Stayed here for a Saturday night break at the end of November.  Booked through the marker website and did not realise that the hotel does not have parking unless it is pre-booked so had to pay a fortune for parking in a local car park.  The room was beautiful.  We asked for more toiletries because we had booked a twin room but the room had only one set of very small bottles of shampoo etc..  We never got the second set we asked for and when I mentioned it to the girl at checkout she just shrugged her shoulders and said that they were a busy hotel.  We had drinks in the very beautiful roof top bar.  When we got our drinks the neighbouring table knocked over our drinks when leaving and the bar insisted on charging us for replacement drinks even though we had just been served the drinks and they were untouched. I thought that the service was very cold and dismissive.  
Breakfast is not 5 star standard.  Very average self service buffet with the usual cold greasy fry.  Anything else has a massive supplement added to it.  The coffee was cold and a few tables around us mentioned this tithe waiter who again mentioned that it is a busy hotel.   Massive queues to check in and out.  
Overall the hotel is amazing looking.  The setting and facilities are second to none.  The pool was closed when we stayed which was disappointing.  
The room was gorgeous and the roof top bar was spectacular but I can't help but feel a bit let down by the small things and the breakfast alone is enough to not make me recommend it.  
",2,2014,01,06
206,Excellent Hotel,This is a top hotel and we enjoyed staying here for new years.The room was large nice flat screen TV and and large bathroom. The AC did not work the best and the room was quite warm at night but we were only staying the one night and it didn't bother us too much.we didn't get a chance to go to the roof top bar as it was late opening that evening for some reason. However we will when we return to the marker hotel.,5,2014,01,05
206,Wonderful but...,"I stayed here with my fianc√©e for my first ever trip to Dublin. The staff are wonderfully (overly) attentive; the rooms are fabulous (and the bathrooms - wow!) and generally this is a great place to stay. 

However, staff wandering in mid-afternoon to check the mini-bar and papers not being delivered as requested; insanely expensive bar prices and decidedly iffy food conspire to make this a 'just good enough' 4-star experience. And given how much you'll have paid to stay here...

That said, we'll stay here again. Thank you :)",4,2014,01,05
206,Great spot,Just about to check out after a really nice overnight stay.  The Marker is situated on Grand Canal Dock beside the Grand Canal Theatre where there is a great buzz in the evening. had a drink on the roof-top bar last night - fantastic views - brung warm clothes..... Staff have been really friendly and helpful. All in all top class hotel and we will be back. Derek,5,2014,01,05
206,"Lovely hotel, well worth a stay","Stayed here recently for a night & loved the hotel. Beautiful, comfortable, spacious bedrooms & great bathrooms, obviously it's a new hotel so everything is sparkly & new but just so comfortable. Staff are so friendly. We were planning on dining somewhere else but when we saw the restaurant dinner menu, we decided to give it ago & my word were we glad we did. Food is fabulous,  can compete against the very best of restaurants in Dublin City. Great cocktails, a little expensive but nice treat. Only negative is we didn't enquire about parking prior to arrival so it was a little tricky & expensive! But if we had arranged in advance, they do have concierge! But great stay & will be definitely back again",4,2014,01,04
206,'Le Drunch' experience is a must...,"We decided to have a look at the new 'le drunch' experience in the Marker Hotel. This is a new concept on a Sunday afternoon, and is a mix of lunch, brunch and dinner. 
The menu is suitably mixed also, with choices appropriate to all three options. The real difference here though, is the quality of the food and the imaginative menu. It really is a lovely way to spend a Sunday afternoon.
We found all the staff to be so friendly and warm and nothing was too much trouble.
The hotel itself has a lovely bar food menu in lovely surroundings.
The rooftop bar is a real surprise....on the 7th floor......again, with a very imaginative menu and a spectacular view. On cooler days they offer customers who wish to sit out in the open, a blanket and hot water bottle.
I can only imagine how wonderful the space is on a warm sunny afternoon in summer. 
Be warned, though, the maximum number of people allowed here is 120.....and those who miss out must queue to wait for patrons to leave.

I must say, the Marker Hotel was a real surprise. The location, decor, food and service are really five star.
Treat yourself!!!!!!!!",5,2014,01,03
206,The Marker Hotel - Truly Excellent,"We spent three nights here celebrating my 50th Birthday and our stay was wonderful.  The Hotel is very modern and in a great peaceful location. On check-in we were told we had been upgraded and when we got to our room there was a beautiful slice of cake on a chocolate decorated plate waiting! Was really impressed with the i-pad stand, which also allowed you to charge your i-pad or i-phone without the hassle of cables.  Had dinner in the hotel on 1st night, and although there are some tables on the lobby side, the larger part is behind.  Our meal was perfect and we couldn't complain about anything.  The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was not included in our deal but if booked at reception the night before you get a discount. Complimentary newspaper each morning.  We used the leisure facilities on two mornings which were spotless, the walk in Jacuzzi was great and it was very relaxing.  Visited the roof top bar one night and the views were amazing.  Obviously because of the time of year we had to sit inside - the bar area is relatively small and only holds around 35, but I was glad that we had taken the time to visit it.  The prices charged in the hotel are not really any more than anywhere else in Dublin.  We walked into the centre of town every morning, about 20 minutes leisurely stroll along the River Liffey, with plenty of photo opportunities, and then just took a taxi back at night - under 10 euros. There are also a few restaurants, bars and cafes in the immediate area of the hotel.  All in all we were happy that we had chosen the Marker Hotel and cant wait to return.",5,2014,01,01
206,Amazing New Years Eve!,"We have just returned from New Years Eve in the Marker Hotel in Dublin.  My husband Michael, son Mick and wife Elaine were spending the evening in the city as my son Robert and his band, Cold Comfort, were supporting the Hot Sprockets in the Workingmens Club.  The plan was to have dinner in the hotel and taxi up to the club, see the band and then back to the hotel for the countdown.  Did the plan work? Yes! 
We arrived at the hotel to check in and were offered an upgrade to the Presidential Suite!  We had two bedrooms with a reception area and sitting room.  The views were stunning.  We were thrilled with the lovely rooms and the staff were amazing, courteous, attentive and very efficient.  We had the taster menu and were joined by Edrina and Mark (my son's friends).  The meal was delicious and the lads had the wine with the taster menu, they loved it.  Throughout the meal the service was great. The views from the dining area are great and we could not complain about any aspect of the meal.  
We left and went to the gig and Cold Comfort did not disappoint, they were amazing.  We then returned to the rooftop cocktail bar.  Brrrrrr it was cold but great fun, we eventually got some blankets and hot water bottles and danced till 2pm.  Then back to the bar downstairs.  We met lots of interesting people and had a great laugh!  Back to our suite till the much later hours.  A great breakfast in the reception area of our suite and back to reality.  Will we return.  Yes!  We have previously been for dinner before the Bord Gas Energy Theatre and it was lovely and very convenient.",5,2014,01,01
206,Top quality - strongly recommended,"Lively, personal and friendly hotel (unlike so many standard hotel chains). Quite a way out of city centre but trams run every 5-10 mins so no big deal. Service, furnishings, rooms and rooftop bar all excellent. Great breakfast and free internet - go stay. ",5,2013,12,31
206,Excellent service,"From the moment we arrived the service in the Marker was 5* we were upgraded to a corner suite, personally I did not see this as a suite, more a larger hotel room. Valet parking was excellent, check in was seamless and receptionist was most helpful.

We had a drink in the bar (extortionate prices) before one of the best meals I've ever tasted. Service was a little slow between our starter and main, leaving us short of time as we were heading to see a show but our request to have our dessert on return to the hotel was absolutely no problem as long as we didn't mind having it in the bar (where we would be anyway) 
Breakfast was very good, the scrambled egg was piping which it never is in a hotel breakfast. Again, service was ever so slightly slow.

Check out was again seamless, the porter was with us immediately to ask if we needed help or had a car to be collected. 

On return home we realised we had forgotten a phone charger and also to catch the name of the wine we'd had with dinner, a quick email and both were sorted in minutes. 

The very few small issues about the slight delays in service and the perhaps slight exaggeration in calling the room a luxury suite didn't stop us raving about what an amazing overall experience we had in the Marker, I would definitely recommend and we will be back to eat there again in the future.",4,2013,12,30
206,Marker,"Just back from a stay in this hotel. I was extremely excited about a night away with my partner and my best friend and her husband but sadly left extremely disappointed.  
For a 5 star hotel it was no where near up to standard as 5 star hotels go this was poor very poor. 
Booked dinner in the hotels restaurant , then realised that the restaurant was actually in the lobby which I found very odd. I ordered lamb to then be told that they dont have mint sauce the waitress said everybody asks but the chef continues to ignore this, strange. Instead I d3cided to order the steak medium,it was served well done and my chips cold. My partners vension was also meant to be served medium that came also overcooked. The manager was extremely apologetic and a really lovely man and gave us our mains that were not right on the house. But the meal had be spolit after all that. I had to eat my new steak whilst my friends had all finished. 
Then we decided to have a few drinks in the bar and the floor staff were extremly slow with drink orders.
We were staying on the 3rd floor , complimentary paper never arrived me had to ring twice to ask them to send it up. a guy knocked on our door twice while we were snoozing to check mini bar,kinda annoying
All in all for the standard of what you would expect from a5 star hotels this does not come close. Room cost 240 for 1 night stay and I left utterly disappointed.",2,2013,12,29
206,Disappointing.,"The hotel itself is a wonderful building in the heart of the Grand Canal Dock area of Dublin City. The staff were friendly and facilities were excellent. The rooftop terrace is a particularly nice touch.

We arrived at 3.15 (check-in time in 3pm) only to be told that the room was not ready. We were instructed to wait in the bar or to go up to the rooftop terrace (but not offered any sort of complimentary drink for the inconvenience). I would not usually have minded a slight delay but we had dinner reservations in the city for 5.30pm and also heading to a show for 7.30pm so we were on a strict deadline. We eventually got into the room at 4.15 and the luggage was delivered to the room shortly afterwards. This gave myself and my partner only less than an hour to get ready for the night ahead which was a considerable inconvenience.

The other issue I has was with the parking. I did not book the valet parking as I would unaware at the ludicrous rates charged by the Park Rite car park (sign posted as the Marker car park) next door to the hotel. Parking was ‚Ç¨30 for the overnight stay!

Finally, we arrived back to the hotel around midnight and say in the lounge for a drink. Yes it was busy at the time, but service was unneccessarily slow.",3,2013,12,27
206,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to staying here and seeing a show having booked it well in advance. First, checking in, the lady was so lovely but kept up waiting while she took THREE phonecalls interrupting the checking in process each time. The room itself and the hotel is very luxurious the beds are lovely and big, very comfortable and the bathroom is lovely. The window was full length looking out over the theatre. We went for lunch and ordered chicken gujons and chips, when they came myself and the children thought it tasted like fish and asked the man working there who checked with the chef but assured us it was chicken. None of us ate them- chicken tasting like fish isn't too appealing (I still think it was fish) I told the guy when I was paying and he apologised and took my name to tell his fellow colleagues  to give us a round of drinks after the show. We returned to the hotel and ordered drinks (a glass of wine for myself and two children's drinks) and I was charged 26‚Ç¨ I just mentioned it that I was told I could have some drinks after paying for food we didn't eat and he assured me he had no idea no message had been passed on! I just paid so as not to cause a Fuss. In the bedroom, there is no black out blinds so the lights from the theatre lit up the room for the night causing a very broken nights sleep.  It really is the little things that make a big difference.breakfast was lovely- the staff were very nice and warm.
Also, I left my phone charger left plugged in in the bedroom (I remember reminding myself to get it and I forgot) I called today and was assured there was no charger found, the guy who answered the phone said he would go to housekeeping and ring me back within ten minutes... I'm still waiting. So if they can't find it (it was plugged in on a table!) it must have been stolen and surely this should be addressed. Over all, my experience was very average I would absolutely stay elsewhere again for the price I paid here, the west bury  was cheaper and their standards are much higher.",3,2013,12,23
206,Really enjoyable stay,"We stayed here as we where going to see Wicked in the Bord Gais theatre - couldnt have asked for a better location - literally opposite.

On arrival we found the parking confusing - we pulled into a QPark car park which was called the Marker Carpark- on arriving at reception i was glad i asked about it as this is a public carpark which has a maximum daily charge of E30... we were advised to move the car round the front of the hotel where it would be valet parked for E20.... so be cautious of that QPark.

The room was lovely - spacious, heated bathroom floor, and a very large bathroom.

The pool was lovely - very quiet and we had an enjoyable swim. hanging rooms where spotless and the showers amazing.

Later int he evening we went tot he rooftopbar - unfortunatly it was raining but we went into a little conservatory style room they had up there. Im sure the rooftop would be lovely in the summer. Price wise it was a bit more expensive.. but nice to be up there all the same.

The next day breakfast was again very good.... plently of choice. Attentive staff.

As a whole we found all of the staff incredible friendly and helpful.... from the man on the door, to reception, the the food and beverage staff they were all very very nice.

Ive stayed at many hotels across the world and to be honest dont often stay away from the Hilton or Marriott brand - but this one was refreshing - i absolutly couldnt not find a bad thing to say.

Well done Marker Hotel - we will be back!",5,2013,12,23
206,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed here for the weekend and had a fantastic experience. From check-in the staff where very friendly and helpful. We stayed in a deluxe room with great view over Grand Canal Square. The bedroom was beautifully decorated and the bed was massive; one of the most comfortable we have ever slept in! The pool and spa were a very pleasant surprise for a city centre hotel.  The food in the hotel was also excellent, especially the breakfast and the bar had a great atmosphere. 

We also had a drink at the roof top bar...a little cold in the middle of December but would be a lovely experience in the summer months.

 Our only fault would be the heat in the bedrooms.. we found another guests had the same issues with the air conditioning system, but is now our new favourite hotel in Dublin!",5,2013,12,22
206,Was going to a show. There were 4 off us. ,"5 * rating for Hotel. it was fab, staff good. Beautiful hotel Nisei sinery food was ok too. Would not be rushing back. Menus bar and Resturant had a very poor selection. My friend is vegetarian and all what was on menu was a sandwich were we came for dinner. Staff were lovely on the day and chefs did make her a pasty this which was lovely. Would stay in the hotel no prob fab hotel ",5,2013,12,22
206,Loved it,"I'm a proper hotel snob but I can't find anything to fault the place. Does all the basics well which many 5 stars don't, but also does the non-basics well as well. Huge rooms, bathrooms are great, powerful shower, good irons, incredibly comfy bed and great facilities.

I usually stay in the Morrison, which is also a great hotel, but this is way better. A pleasure to have stayed there.",5,2013,12,21
206,Brilliant stay at The Marker Hotel!,"Our first time staying in this hotel and  it was a fabulous experience - from the moment we arrived with the valet parking the friendly welcoming staff made our stay unforgettable. We were in Dublin for the Andr√© Rieu concert at the O2/Point and decided to treat ourselves to an overall five-star experience! The room was lovely and had an iPhone/iPad Dock, proper hair dryers, not nailed down ones, and real cafetiere coffee, and the most comfy bed. 
I went for a swim in the lovely infinity pool and a pleasant surprise was the complimentary fresh orange juice I was offered by the pleasant girl at reception after my swim, steam and sauna.  
We went for a pre-show drink and tasters in the unique Rooftop Lounge where we were warmly welcomed by the manager and staff, and I enjoyed  a glass of wine with delicious prawns, rosemary and a√Øoli fries and black pudding and sausage rolls, while hubby had baked chorizo with sourdough bread, accompanied by a craft Belgian beer, Leffe blond. The weather was atrocious with heavy rains and high wined but we still managed to get some lovely photos of panoramic views of iconic landmarks like the Convention Centre and the Liebeskind-designed Grand Canal Square and theatre. 
After the wonderful show we went for a drink in the bar, and again enjoyed the attention to detail and warm hospitality of the staff. Breakfast this morning was perfect as I managed to snag the last Cronut - it was divine and I'd been looking forward to it for ages, since I'd first heard of them when the craze hit Ireland. In fact the only downside was that the Cronuts were sold out and I couldn't buy some to bring home and for a friend as I'd planned. I'll have to come back to rectify that soon!
Thanks so much to everyone in The Marker for a wonderful experience and looking forward to a return visit someday! ",5,2013,12,19
206,Great Staff,The location there is fantastic for the 02 or the BGE theatre. We only stayed one night but would like to have spent longer there. Te reception staff were brilliant at all times and the valet parking was a bonus. Ask for a King size bedroom overlooking the BGE and the Grand Canal.The downstairs bar was not very impressive and the breakfast was only average but we were still happy overall.We did not get to sample the Rooftop bar or the Spa but hopefully next time.,4,2013,12,18
206,The best Hotel I have stayed in!,"Stayed at the hotel in the summer, and when they say 5 star they mean 5 star. This hotel is purpose built. The staff, the rooms, and the hotel in general is top class, I cant fault it.

We arrived in may and availed of the valet parking, on entering the Hotel we were met by a staff member at the entrance who was a chatty Dub guy (which was a nice touch nice to see a local on the door) and very pleasant and really gave a feel good factor right from the off.
 
The staff inside are definitely handpicked, they are multinational, well dressed, quietly spoken, courteous and helpful. If you are wandering around reception or the bar and appear confused a staff member usually appears to check if you are ok, all the staff are almost too nice in fact :) 

The rooms are fantastic with air-con hdtv, minibar etc.You get a king size double bed and a large bathroom with a big shower and separate bathtub. All the decor (like the hotel in general) is contemporary and slick.

The leisure center is fantastic as well. We didn't get to the rooftop bar, its supposed to be great. We didn't eat there as we had a booking somewhere else but the menu looked tempting.

On leaving our car was brought up, and our bags brought out and put into the car, wer were given 2 bottles of water and a box of chocolates by the porter.

In conclusion, if you want to bring a loved one for a surpise break, or a stopover before a honeymoon (its not cheap though but worth it) and If you want to feel like you are in a Bond movie then I suggest you stay at this hotel.",5,2013,12,17
206,Fantastic experience,"Stayed at The Marker a few days ago....wow! We loved every minute of it.  The staff on arriving were very attentive. The room was beautifully finished with an extremely comfortable bed and fantastic shower, perfect size nice strong water pressure.
Later after rushing off for a show on the 02 which is close by we returned to a beautifully serviced room, with chocolates on my pillow, slippers, the works!
The spa was absolutely gorgeous, we had a massage and facial each abs I'm not joking... I was floating after the treatments.
The spa was very tastefully decorated for Christmas. I was allowed take photos to remember the attention to detail.
If you're cOnsidering booking The Marker please do you won't be disappointed, I promise. ",5,2013,12,17
206,excellent,I celebrated my birthday in this hotel and received a free upgrade to a deluxe king room. The bed was huge and really comfy. The room was a decent size and modern as was the hotel. I went down to the pool area which was also excellent to come back to my room to a cake with a happy birthday note. Before you go to bed staff come in and give you the breakfast menu with a little box of choccies. The breakfast was fantastic and this hotel really cannot do enough for you i am already planning 2 more trips back to dublin simply to visit this hotel.,5,2013,12,16
206,Very good hotel - but room from improvement to be 5*,"I've wanted to stay in this hotel as I'd heard good things about it and its always nice to try a brand new modern hotel. Only got to stay one night (Sat night). This is a very good hotel. Many, many positives but there is room for improvement to warrant the prices and the 5 star rating.

Positives: very modern, interesting architectural design, comfortable and clean new hotel in the Dublin dockland area. If you are looking to be a little out of the city centre but don‚Äôt mind a 25min walk to Grafton St, or you are OK using taxi's/LUAS, then this is a lovely location. Very safe. Brand new area right beside the Bord Gais Energy Theatre. 
1. Room was pretty large - had a deluxe king room. Very comfortable bed. Nice touches incl Ipod charger, tea/coffee/cookies, free bottled water. Lots of in-room amenities incl use of umbrella for those wet days! Room was very quiet and had a lovely view of the Grand Canal and the Bord Gais Energy Theater & plaza. Very well insulated room - no noise from any direction. 
2. Air con and very good in-room entertainment system. 
3.Bathroom had separate shower and tub. Very good bath products. Full marble bathroom with plenty of room. I believe these is supposed to be under floor heating but it wasn‚Äôt working in my room (508). 
4.Valet parking is available and pre-booking is essential because it‚Äôs a busy area. 
5. Pool and hot rub & steam room, sauna. Really a big + for the hotel. Lovely and relaxing and a high-class product. I really enjoyed it. Not many hotels have this type of facility in the city centre.
6. Nice touches like olives & nuts with your cocktails. Bottled water left in the car by the valet.
7. Staff friendly and attentive in general and all very helpful. 
8. I believe the roof-top bar is amazing. Didn‚Äôt get to sample it as it was terrible weather. 

Room for improvement: I've stayed in quite a few 5* hotels around the world and there has to be something extra special to warrant a 5* rating. The Marker didn‚Äôt really hit the spot. It wasn‚Äôt any one major thing, just a series of little quirks that make it 4* rather than the 5* you are paying for.
1. 50euro hold added to credit card for extras but not mentioned at check-in until I queried it.
2. Offered a free Sunday newspaper but it was never delivered.
3. Wasn‚Äôt shown where the lifts were at check-in.  No help with luggage. Seemed to be selective offering of help with bags. People next to me were offered help but we weren‚Äôt.
4. Spent quite a bit of money on drinks in the bar that evening. Cocktails are expensive but very, very good - however, no late service in the bar at weekends i.e. they turned up the air chiller at 12.30am to make it uncomfortable to stay in the bar area. People put on their coats but in the end over about 30mins people left. It was way too cold and really unnecessary. I felt they wanted to clear the area. I asked for chiller to be turned off but the staff member just nodded but did nothing.
5. Breakfast was nothing special at all. Breakfast location is nice. Service was fast. Selection was poor I felt for a 5*. Doesn‚Äôt compare to e.g. Ritz-Carlton, Westbury, Merrion. Full Irish was limited in selection no beans, only watery scrambled eggs. Big issue is that the hot food was luke warm and the plates cold also. Toast was, well, not toast. It had been in the toaster all of 10 seconds I'd say. Limited breads and pastries. So not really up to the appropriate standard.
6. Floor area around pool/hot-tub was very wet and slippery. A slip hazard I think. 
7. I didn‚Äôt see a customer survey card and when I said my stay was adequate at check-out, I wasn‚Äôt asked to elaborate - is adequate a great response?

So in summary - this is a very good hotel. It has a lot going for it and is a very spectacular building, however, it‚Äôs the small niggly things that make you less impressed with the stay. They have to sort the breakfast for a start. This has the potential to be a great hotel and is a welcome addition to the Dublin scene - just needs to listen to reviews like mine, seek our opinion and implement a few changes to make this a true 5 star experience.",4,2013,12,16
206,Fabulous atmosphere and service shame about the food!!,"Visited the hotel for dinner only so unable to comment on the hotel rooms etc. 

Outstanding service at the brasserie and roof top bar however let down by the poor quality of food! 

Such a shame as front of house staff are absolutely astounding!! ",4,2013,12,13
206,"Lovely location, wee bit out of town though","Lovely hotel, very modern and beautifully designed. Car parking extortionate though and given the price of hotel it really is nit acceptable to charge 30 for an overnight given I arrived each night after 1900 and left at 0700 each day. Apart from that hotel is lovely and stylishly upmarket",4,2013,12,13
206,Not the FIVE star they claim,"The hotel was not what I expected.  I felt like I was staying in an Ibis or Mercure....except with heated bathroom floors.  

The lighting in the bathroom is terrible.  As a female traveler it was impossible to put on my makeup!  I had to use a mirror by the window for lighting.  There are NO plugs for a hairdryer or flat iron/curling iron.  The nearest plug  is in the hall way.  I chose to unplug the lamp and dry my hair next to the window.   Female travelers should avoid this place unless you are totally into the natural look... including air dried hair.  

We were under the impression were going to have a canal view...instead we had a view of the square view and could see a small corner of the canal.  The heat in the room was impossible to control.  Any other setting besides high heat blew out cold air.  I contacted the front desk several times even in the middle of the night but the issue was never resolved. 

The breakfast was mediocre.  Not what I expected from a ""posh"" hotel.  The Irish bacon and apples were great but not worth the outrageous price they were charging,  If you wanted something more than a ""continental"" breakfast there was an additional charge for items. 

The location is not the greatest but the area is quiet.   It is difficult to find the hotel and not all of the taxi drivers are familiar with the hotel.  

The bathroom grout looked dirty.  My first impression was to shower with my flip flops on.  I took a look at the rest of the grout and realized it had not been sealed properly.  Corners were cut during the construction.  We had a family member staying in the same hotel and they had a completely different thermostat.  

The pillows were as hard as rocks.  No fluffy pillows here! 

As a guest there is no real priority for spa treatments.  I had planned to relax and pamper myself but when I called for appointments they were at times that were not convenient.  

l felt let down after my five day stay.  I was expecting a great modern hotel with glamour...instead I felt like I stayed at a budget hotel with an onsite spa. The eucalyptus steam room was the high point of my stay.  We cut our six day stay short by one night - no regrets on that decision!",3,2013,12,13
206,Something a bit different.,"The Marker makes a nice change from your usual Dublin 5star. The staff are very attentive but also friendly and familiar, no calling you 'sir' stuff and smiley rather than formal, a style I prefer. The hotel itself has some seriously contemporary architecture and the rooftop bar is a great little hidden hideaway gem in the hotel. The rooms are spacious but not as plush as you'd expect for a 5star. More minimal. The bed was one of the most comfy I ever slept in though and the bathroom was set in marble and larger than most bedrooms. Little downsides were no late bar on weekends and the dinner really was nothing to write home about and a bit disappointing and lackluster, though very well presented. The hotel does very well on little touches, like putting bottles of water in your car when they valet it etc. I'd certainly recommend the hotel. However I will say it wouldn't be a regular haunt of mine. I prefer the old style class of the Fitzwilliam, Westbury etc. to this modern take. Still, a very impressive modern take it is.",4,2013,12,09
206,Average,"Very nice looking hotel and not hard to find.
Tried to check in at 16.00 but was told our room was not ready and we would get a call when it was ready, tired from our trip we decided to check out the rooftop bar and had to wait until after 17.00 for a call.Not very professional.
As we had got our room late, we decided to use the pool and eat in the restaurant later. The pool is out of this world and great facilities with it.
The restaurant later in the evening was half full and had a nice atmosphere and staff were very nice, but the length of time between our starter and main was approx 40 minutes or more and no reason or apology given. We later found out from other guests that there had been a problem with the ovens.
All in all, a nice hotel but pushing at the 5 stars...",3,2013,12,09
206,Nicest hotel staff in Ireland? Probably!,"I stayed here after working abroad for 6 months. On check-in we mentioned that we were engaged but had not yet had a chance to celebrate. 30 mins after check-in, a bottle of wine arrived at the door along with a letter from the manager congratulating us on our engagement! We has EXCELLENT food at the roof top bar and upon sitting down we were handed a free glass of sparkling wine and again congratulated on our engagement! The rooftop bar has an excellent view and the atmosphere was amazing. We really enjoyed our stay at The Marker. The rooms were ultra modern in decoration and design; the staff were very friendly and totally professional but the little touches made our stay so much more enjoyable. We had nice cocktails but the Guinness in the bar wasn't great. We highly recommend The Marker, and the staff are possibly the nicest hotel staff in Ireland. ",5,2013,12,09
206,Amazing Place,"Just back from a trip to Dublin with my Girlfriend who booked it all for my 40th.  The hotel is fantastic, could not fault it in anyway and wouldnt change a thing.  The staff are really friendly and helpful.  They allowed us to check in early and check out late with no problem at all.  Room is very spacious and everything you would expect.  Spa is very nice too, although could be doing with a few more loungers.  Breakfast was good.  We didn't eat in the hotel as we wanted to head into town for the criac!  Room service appeared shortly before we were ready to head out with a lovely couple of strawberry cakes on a beautiful plate with Happy Birthday in drizzled chocolate, what a lovely touch!  Would definitely go back, need to find an excuse soon.  Other hotels need to live up to this sort of standard!",5,2013,12,08
206,Super service with great location,"The Marker is a very stylist hotel located right where you want it to be in Dublin. The service is excellent, not in your face, but just there when you need it and very professional. The only real criticism I would have was that we stayed close to Christmas and there was a Christmas party on the night we stayed which meant the bar was packed and we couldn't get a seat anywhere. We didn't eat there though so it didn't make a huge difference. We left and went to a nearby pub for a drink and a seat before we got a taxi to the restaurant. Breakfast in the morning is also excellent.",4,2013,12,07
206,5 Star really?,"Spent 2 nights in the Marker recently. Drove into the Marker car park. Its like entering the Bermuda triangle. No signage where to go. Met a nice guy who brought us up in the 'staff' car park. So we had an amazing journey through the kitchen and onwards into the foyer. Moved past slightly amused staff to reception. Mary had booked the weekend as a wedding anniversary presenet and had paid for the 2 nights up front. Girl at reception told us we had only paid for 1 night and tried to charge us for the 2nd night. Luckily Mary had the original print out and the receptionist agreed all in order. Went to the room. No complaints. Nice luxury, great views of the Canal Docks and the historically significant Bolands Mills. Decided to avoid the ‚Ç¨25 per person breakfast and ate in a nice cafe in town next morning. Used the pool Saturday afternoon and enjoyed the facility. Went to Pichet Saturday night and decided to be a bit lazy and order breakfast to the room for Sunday. Decided to be clever as we always end up with too much breakfast food, so ordered 1 fried breakfast and coffee. Boy were we disappointed, 1 Museli (inedible), 1 sausage, 1 egg, 1 white pudding, 1 half tomato, 1 hash brown. No rasher or anything else of interest. ‚Ç¨25 euro + tip. Very poor value. Booked out of hotel and the receptionist tried to charge us for the 2nd night. The fact we had left the 'voucher' with the original receptionist seemed not to have travelled. Not 5 star.",3,2013,12,04
206,Great for Pro Basketball players who bring night vision goggles,"The design of the room represents the triumph of form over function. 
The bathrooms are so dark that it is well nigh impossible for a man to shave or a woman to apply makeup. 
There is not enough shelf space or drawer space for more than one person staying more than one night.
The light switches by the bedside are so far away that only NBA players could reach them without getting out of bed.
Too bad that the staff was friendly and knowledgeable. They have to listen to guests complaining about these irremediable design flaws",3,2013,12,03
206,Amazing,"We stayed at The Marker for 2 nights. From the moment we checked in the vibe was relaxed, friendly yet highly efficient. The staff made their jobs appear effortless, however i am sure it is anything but. I was fortunate to co incide our trip with my birthday and the cake sent to our room was incredibly thoughtful. We relished every moment of our stay. The rooftop bar, lobby bar, spa etc etc was faultless. We relaxed and felt like we had been away a week and not just 3 days. We can't wait to return. Many thanks to all who made our break so memorable and special.
",5,2013,12,02
206,Suberb Hotel,"We stayed at The Marker for just one night for a fleeting visit to Dublin on business and a bit of rugby pleasure! I was so impressed with the Hotel. The staff were so helpful and courteous and the whole ambience was slick, stylish and elegant. The rooms are large enough with lovely pillows and a great view. My only complaint was I hate a wet room as the floor stays wet and then when you are going in and out to do your make up or look at your appearance, your feet get wet! But saying that the shower room was very spacious and well equipped! Breakfast was really lovely and just spot on and we ate later on after the rugby in the bar in the lobby and had the best fish and chips I have had in years!! Great location too - near enough town and the rubgby without being on top of the chaos and crowds! Infact a lovely walk into town! Would definitely come back!!",5,2013,12,02
206,One of the best - nearly.,"My Wife and I plus my Daughter her husband and their 10 month old baby stayed at this hotel over  a weekend.
The d√©cor was very luxurious and modern in the public areas. Very high ceilings and minimal with hints of colour.
The standard rooms we had were quite big with a super king sized bed, 2 chairs and a desk chair. The bed was very comfortable. Even the air-con worked properly. Tucked away in a hidden recess was the mini-bar, fridge and tea/coffee making facilities. A nice touch was a 2 cup cafetiere with good quality ground coffee. Other additions were a free laptop sized safe, full sized umbrella, iron and board, sewing kit etc.
The bathroom, as the bedroom had high ceilings, a full sized bath set into marble and a good sized glass shower. Very spacious. With the usual toiletries.
We had breakfast each day where the service was attentive, quick and extremely polite. The actual breakfast was buffet style with plenty of choice with top quality produce.
We ate in the hotel bar one evening and again the service was excellent and the food was well priced and of a high quality. We respectively ate steak, beef-burger and steak and Guinness casserole. They are all recommended.
The corridors are dark wood with down-lighters that give a very dark feel which I did not like.
Similarly the pool area was also dark with music that was too loud. The impression did not impress our 10 month old who took a while to settle to the surroundings when we entered at about 5.45pm. 
I was extremely unimpressed when we were approached by a member of staff who told us to leave the pool as children were only allowed in between 10-12 noon 3 and 5pm over the weekend. There was no one else in the pool at the time. We were checked into the pool by a staff member who provided towels so that staff member did not know either and/or did not tell us at that time. We were not informed of this prior to booking or when we checked in. It was only after the ejection that we saw a temporary notice in one of the 2 lifts. 
The location of the hotel is in the business area and about a 20 minute walk from Grafton Street but the area is modern, elegant and quiet. There are some bars, cafes, restaurants and convenience stores in the immediate area but they are all a little over priced. It is a 2 minute walk to the bands of the River Liffey. 
Apart from the nonsense of the pool the hotel is excellent.",5,2013,12,02
206,Superb,"I can understand why this hotel gets such high marks. Stayed here two nights and it was absolutely terrific. Spotlessly clean, very stylish, efficient and helpful staff, great bar... A modern 5 star, less than a year old, in a good location. Only drawback was trying to find the place for the first time if you are driving, even with sat nav. Will look forward to staying again.",5,2013,12,02
206,Could be better,"This is quite a posh hotel located next to the Grand Canal Theater in the Dublin Docklands. On weekends there is quite a buzz about the whole area with theater goers and the hotel is in the middle of this, which is nice. The decor is also pretty sleek modern stuff, and all the staff are very attentive as they usually are in hotels which are this expensive. the rooftop bar is nice too.  A few qualms though based on a one night stay:

-they make you prepay on check in, and even pre-charge you 50‚Ç¨ for 'extras' which you might or might not consume. This seems quite grasping as the first contact with the hotel and not something I'm used to although they said it was common practice.

-there were no movie channels on the tv system beyond free ones (film4). considering the room rate, they should provide something a bit better.

-the phone charger in the room didn't work

-the curtains next to the table at breakfast were spattered with spills of all types, it looked a bit gross.

overall, would not really want to go back.",3,2013,12,01
206,Great Hotel,"We stayed here 29th November and from start to finish it was a great experience the staff were welcoming the room was fantastic with a huge bathroom and large shower cubicle.
the service at the bar was brilliant very friendly and efficient. Our stay in one word was fantastic.",5,2013,12,01
206,Very relaxing,My husband and I recently stayed in this hotel and found it incredibly relaxing from start to finish. Staff were very friendly and more than helpful from arrival to check out. We also had a great experience in the spa - the first time I have fallen asleep whilst getting a treatment. Great ambiance and all round atmosphere. Probably a little more modern and different to the usual 5* hotels but all in all very smart. The only thing I would recommend is to pre-book parking prior to arrival - something we overlooked and ended up having to park a few blocks away. Will definitely return.,5,2013,11,27
206,The Bord Gais' Local.,"Sorry, Westbury, I've been unfaithful... despite saying I'd never stay anywhere else in Dublin, I have. Needing to be near the Bord Gais theatre, the Marker is the obvious choice, a mere stagger away. Stark modern architecture in the lobby and brasserie restaurant (all very open plan / huge ceilings), and very minimal, restrained rooms. Lunch at the Brasserie was very good and staff handled a rolling cast of guests coming and going. Rooftop bar at cocktail hour is very popular and they thoughtfully give you fleece blankets to block out the Dublin climate as best they can. Service up there was however very slow.
The room was nothing special but the bathroom was magnificent - a huge expanse of marble with strange toiletries - rum bodywash and peppermint shampoo I think?
Main MASSIVE gripe with this hotel was the horrible slices of foam masquerading as pillows. WHY?? in a 5* hotel? completely unacceptable and enough to give a lousy night's sleep.
Fantastic breakfast buffet with a mix your own virgin mary bar (am sure they'll give you a shot of vodka to go bloody). Great pool and gym facilities.
Convenience for the theatre means I may end up at the Marker again, but I will go grovelling back to the Westbury to apologise for not sticking to my promise... The Marker's just not in the same class.",3,2013,11,26
206,extremely enjoyable stay,"My husband I were recently very lucky  to celebrate an anniversary with a night in the Marker Hotel. We pre-booked valet parking -which is well worth it, and were quickly booked in by  friendly and very efficient staff in reception  On arrival to our room we were surprised to be greeted with a congratulatory personal note from the manager and gorgeous cake in honour of our anniversary! Which was a real surprise treat (we had mentioned it briefly when booking)  The room was a fabulous very large corner room with stunning views over the docks and theatre at night, the  bathroom had a fantastic walk-in shower as well as a super deep bath We had pre-dinner drinks on the roof top and were looked after by super friendly staff who made sure we were warm as it was a very chilly night!!  Dinner was supper and although part of the restaurant is near reception and is open plan I expected there to be more noise but that wasn't the case at all!  The ""Piece de resistance"" was the breakfast!!   Best I've  had in a 5 star.  Absolutely fantastic every single bit of it, despite being very busy the service was incredible-delph and cutlery quietly disappeared in a flash between courses. The best bacon and sausages I've had in decades!!",5,2013,11,25
206,"Modern luxury, at a price","My husband and I stayed here on a Friday night, and we were pretty impressed.  The Marker definitely lives up to its 5* rating. From the moment you‚Äôre greeted by the doormen you know that you‚Äôre staying in a 5* hotel. Check in was quick and very friendly, we were offered help with our bags too. We were celebrating our first wedding anniversary, so were delighted to be upgraded to a deluxe room, meaning we had a nice view of the theatre and the dock. The rooms are really nice, very spacious with all the amenities you need (bathrobes, safe, tea coffee etc.). The bed was very comfy, and the bathroom was huge, the under floor heating was great too. 
The rooftop bar is worth a visit, it‚Äôs pretty expensive, but the cocktails are good, and the views are nice. Even in cold weather, the heaters and blankets keep you warm.
The spa was booked out for treatments during our stay, so we just used the pool facilities. It‚Äôs a really nice pool, the lighting is very relaxing, but the Jacuzzi wasn‚Äôt near warm enough (I guess because it‚Äôs so big, it‚Äôs hard to heat?). The steam room was excellent, but unfortunately the sauna was out of order for maintenance.
The breakfast is good, very high quality food, but maybe 1 sausage and 1 piece of pudding per guest is a little stingy? ‚Ç¨5 tray charge to have breakfast in your room seems excessive too. We had to call twice for a bucket of ice, as after waiting over 20mins after asking for it, it was never brought to our room. Wifi is free and a good speed, and there‚Äôs a good selection of tv channels. The apple docking stations do not fit iPhone 5s though, and it would be good if they were connected to the tv or speakers to listen to music. I have seen this in a few hotels around the world and it‚Äôs a really nice touch.
The location of the hotel is good, while it‚Äôs not in the city centre; it‚Äôs only about 10mins walk to the Mayor Square Luas stop, and 10 mins to Grand Canal Dock Dart station. There are lots of nice caf√©s and bars in the area, and also a small supermarket.
I live in Dublin, so rarely need to stay in hotels here, but I would recommend the Marker, as long as you have deep pockets though. At ‚Ç¨219 B&B, it‚Äôs far from cheap, even for 5*.",4,2013,11,25
206,Well deserved 5*,"Myself and herself stayed in The Marker for the Sigur Ros concert in November. We had a really memorable experience. No need to reiterate the positive reviews regarding the decor, pool/spa area and the fantastic roof-top bar. The main reason for my taking the time to write this review is to compliment the Staff. They were very attentive, without being overbearing or having a kowtow attitude you often find in hotels of this stature. As we say in Tipperary, ""there was no bulls**t about them"". Very pleasant, without interfering; from Reception staff, Spa/pool area, Bar and especially the chap in the Rooftop Bar. Can't wait to return. (Only downside was ‚Ç¨9.00 for a medium glass of vino. Ah, lads!)",5,2013,11,25
206,Marker Hotel - no complaints,"I stayed at the marker in late November for a couple of days whilst at a conference at the convention centre. 
I arrived early at the hotel 10.45am, but my room was already available for me and the receptionist  gave me a choice of floors.. i stayed in a Deluxe room, right next to the lift, but the sound proofing was great and couldn't hear any noise from my room. 
The deluxe room was lovely with all the amenities you'd expect..although there seemed no facility for on demand movies in the room.. 
The hotel is a 15 minute walk from the centre, and i didn't find the area 'rough' as previous reviewers had mentioned. 
The staff were faultless.. polite and courteous .. 
The Bar was lovely with a real fire..  and the food was all okay, not fantastic , but as you'd expect for bar meals..  breakfast was self service and always hot.
Would recommend for either business or leisure ...",5,2013,11,25
206,Gets better and better....,"Have now stayed in The Marker three times, and it really does get better and better. The service is excellent, rooms beautiful, spacious and fitted out to the last detail, the bar downstairs very comfortable - even though the area is large and open plan, the lighting brings an intimacy to the area. A perfect venue when visiting Bord Gais theatre, which is only a few steps away. 

We had the early bird menu which was delicious, as was the breakfast.

It was lovely to have a nightcap in the Roof top bar, but even with blankets and heaters it was rather cold, but well worth it. Just have your coats with you!",5,2013,11,25
206,Out Standing,"Stayed here last weekend and found this hotel outstanding.

The staff were the best part of the Hotel. The hotel is very modren and up market, but as usual it is staff that make a place.
From the staff at teh front desk right through to the staff at the pool, they set the Hotel off.

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. It is situated in walking distance of Dublin City centre and is in the middle of a beatiful area of modren Dublin.",5,2013,11,23
206,Impecable!,"Our visit to the Marker was perfect in every single way. for a start the service we received was above and beyond. Having arrived before our room was ready we headed into town to shop and while doing so the staff made sure our bags were delivered to our room and also gave us a courtesy call just to tell us that our room was ready which was a lovely personal touch. we had such a perfect experience making the most of the facilities the hotel has to offer with drinks on the rooftop, a morning in the spa and lunch in the bar, the food was epic to say the least. we were really looked after with help and advice so ready and available. our room was outstanding and with the technology and room service we had such a unbelievable experience this really is one of the WORLDS best, not a stone was left unturned for the enjoyment and comfort of the guests. With;

Interactive TV with music (for all genres) prestored 
high speed WiFi for each personal room
very spacious rooms and bathroom (with shower AND bath)
Large windows allowing natural light
sound proof rooms, to only mention a few room specifics.

Also its in a perfect location, we easily walked into the city centre and was also perfect distance for the rugby at Lansdowne Rd Aviva Stadium. I personally can not recommend this place enough. such a fantastic stay i will definitely be back again soon.",5,2013,11,21
206,The Marker - Dublin,"I have stayed in this hotel on business, 6 or 7 times since it opened in April. The location is very convenient for me as I can walk everywhere I need to go.  Breakfast is wonderful and better value than other 5-star hotels in Dublin. The food generally is quite good, although limited in selection, and the rooftop bar has fabulous views.  The spa is one of the nicest I have been to - and I am a spa addict - with a beautiful pool, lovely treatment and relaxation rooms. My only concern about this beautiful, modern 5 star hotel is placement of mirrors in the rooms, with no convenient place to plug in the hair dryer and and do your hair in front of a mirror with good lighting.  The lighting throughout the hotel is very subdued and the bathrooms can be dark, and the hallways almost startlingly so. Service, however, cannot be topped.",5,2013,11,21
206,"Le Drunch, my new favourite category of food","Absolutely delicious from start to finish, although perhaps Im too much of a wimp to appreciate the Bloody Marys (Bellinis were gorgeous). We had a lovely mixture of dishes on the table, from pancakes to wings and ribs and pulled pork sandwich. I love the idea of brunch/breakfast/lunch dining. There is something for everyone and such a high standard. See if you can get the snug around the corner, mega comfy table!",5,2013,11,21
206,Five star luxury,"Recently stayed at the Marker Hotel, have to say, they certainly are on hand to see to your every need: from the guys at the door waiting to park your car and take your bags to the room for you. Reception was efficient and speedy. The room was generous in size, TV was great, bathroom was amazing, massive bath and separate walk in shower, plenty of big soft towels too with great toiletries. Spa facilities were great All in all a luxury hotel with everything you could wish for. And yet if I return to Dublin I wouldn't stay here again, too far out of centre of town and really don't need to pay this high amount to get a perfectly good hotel closer to the centre. A bit too perfect and not enough spirit of friendly Irish welcome.",4,2013,11,21
206,Theatre weekend away,"This hotel is everything you'd expect from a 5 star hotel and more. There is very little to fault here, if anything at all! From being greeted by a smiling doorman on arrival, to taking in the magnificent features of the lobby/bar area, our trip was definitely off to a good start. 
The staff are so highly trained in customer service its almost hard to imagine. Check-in was very smooth. We checked in at 11 knowing it was too early to go to the room but our bags were taken and we were told they would be waiting for us in our room as soon as it was ready. Just over an hour later we got a phonecall to say our room was ready. Wow, the room was very modern with a big bed, bathroom and plush carpets. It was immaculate and the standard of finish that housekeeping adhered to was extremely high. 
Pool and spa area are fabulous, peaceful and calm, and they offer free refreshments and beverages.
Dinner in the restaurant, although menu was limited (understandable for a pre-theatre menu) was delicious, and in my opinion not over priced for the quality and flavour. Our waitress, (Kristina I think) paid great attention to detail along with all of her co workers. The service was fantastic, and most certainly cannot be faulted. 

The staff are what stood out to me during my stay, they are among the best trained staff I have come across to date.

I will definitely return here in the future.
If you're looking for a relaxing city break... this hotel is for you !",5,2013,11,20
206,Lovely Modern Hotel,"I stayed with The Marker in Nov 2013. The rooms were spacious and nicely designed, the carpets were ultra-soft and the bathroom was beautiful. The spa area was among the nicest I have ever seen in a UK hotel, nicely lit and relaxing. The steam room was a great temperature and jacuzzi was wonderful. The breakfast was varied and of a good quality. My only suggestion would be that they could add more vegetarian dishes to the evening menu as I was very short on choice here.",5,2013,11,19
206,A bit disappointing ,"For  a 5 star hotel I have to say I was a little disappointed.  We stayed for one night and perhaps we were just unlucky but there were a few issues that I had with the hotel.  Firstly the car parking charge is ridiculous. I would rather have the cost of parking loaded into the price of the room than have to pay an extra 25 quid on departure for 1 night. When we checked in I had to ring down to reception to find out where our luggage had got to. The staff in general seem terrified of making any mistakes, to the point where it's uncomfortable. The heating wasn't working in our room, however we were given an upgrade and complimentary breakfast which was very welcome. The staff did handle it very well to be fair and the breakfast was awesome. 

Maybe I'm nit picking but when you pay so much for a room you expect a very high standard and while the building and rooms are magnificent it just felt like the value wasn't there. 

By contrast we spent a night in the Sheraton in athlone for a fraction of the price the night before and had a much more comfortable and stress free stay despite the 'lower star rating' 

I know the hotel isn't open that long so maybe it's still in the bedding in process but as I said, for these prices excellence should come as standard. ",3,2013,11,18
206,Great place to stay,"Weekend break - bit of a walk into Temple Bar here, but it is a great location. Staff all courteous and well trained, service was great, and food was fantastic in the restaurant, as you'd expect from a 5* hotel. Don't go to the Marker for a cheap weekend away - its not a criticism in any way as that is not what this type of hotel caters for ... you gte exactly what you pay for in my opinion.

Didn't get a chance to check out the spa and pool ...this time around!!! ... but will be back again.",5,2013,11,18
206,Only average,"We stayed at The Marker Hotel Nov, 16th. We booked late in the week and with a rugby match in town we payed what I consider 'a lot' for bed and breakfast. ‚Ç¨309. Check in is after 3pm so if you're staying for one night this is pretty late. We were on a night away in town away from the early starts one has with children. However, our room was at the end of a corridor and right beside a large extractor fan which kicked into action at approx 6am. Our sleep was interrupted and our sleep-in well and truly over. At check out we made our feelings known and at first were told that maintenance would be made aware of the issue with the noise (brush off in my opinion, maintenance will never be able to do anything about that noise, it is what it is and might I add the receptionist knew exactly what we were referring to when we told her our room number). At this I added that this wasn't acceptable when you pay this type of money for a night away of uninterrupted sleep. She then went to discuss it with her manager whose response was to give us a refund on two glasses of wine we had had with lunch and the tip totalling ‚Ç¨18.50. I can tell you my nights sleep was worth a lot more to me than ‚Ç¨18.50. I made no further complaint as I considered this an insult. I feel totally ripped off and insulted.
On the positive side, the staff were very helpful and friendly in general, the bed was comfortable but with all the hoo ha about this place I felt it was just average. Very disappointing, Won't be back.

 The staff are very friendly and helpful throughout all areas of the hotel which is a big plus.",3,2013,11,17
206,Modern and luxurious hotel,"If you like modern, it's the hotel to go when you are in Dublin!

I stayed there few times for business. The hotel stands just in front of the theatre, in Grand Canal Docks, which is a bit far from the city center but a cab will drive you in Temple Bar in 10 minutes.

The design of the lobby is just amazing. The check-in is smooth and all people very friendly. The rooms and bathrooms are big, beautiful, with quality materials. The rooms are quiet, even if the hotel was full. The breakfast buffet is perfect + they have cronuts! The restaurant is very good as well, just like the cocktails. Even the Guinness is surprisingly very tasty...

The spa is great and complimentary. The gym is a bit small.

Internet is free in the lobby + you have a faster connection in-room.",5,2013,11,17
206,the market hotel,went to the market hotel with my family on Saturday9th November 2013 had a lovely afternoon/evening.the roof top is amazing with views all over Dublin gave each one of us a blanket the food was fabulous staff very polite. will return next time in dublin,5,2013,11,14
206,"Thoroughly modern, great location, just one slight irritation......","I stayed at the Marker in Dublin so I could attend a conference at Dublin's splendid and vast convention centre which is a short walk away across the lovely Grand Canal. The hotel is very new and it has a modern feel and vibrancy which I found appealing. The staff are welcoming, the rooms are well-appointed and the bed very comfortable. The issue I had was that someone down the corridor had set their alarm for 5.00 am, and it woke me. It then went off again. I didn't expect this - I would have expected a hotel of this apparent standard to have adequate soundproofing on doors/walls. A small irritation in the grand scheme of things. The lobby bar is a great meeting place. I would recommend this hotel - I'm sure I was just unlucky with the alarm issue.",4,2013,11,13
206,Wonderful weekend break,"We stayed in The Marker Hotel this weekend as we're going to the Ireland v Samoa rugby match. The hotel is superb, great service from friendly, professional staff and such stylish , modern decor.  The rooftop bar, with views all over Dublin and the bay is wonderful and they give you blankets to ward off the chill if you opt to sit outside.  We were there for early evening drinks.  The final, lovely touch was 2 bottles of water placed in the car for our journey home by the valet parking service.",5,2013,11,10
206,Wow - what a find!!,"My husband and I have just spent the weekend here - what a fantastic hotel!!  The room was wonderful, bathroom big (with heated floor!), turndown service and the best hotel bed I have EVER slept in!  Staff were brilliant, food was fabulous (bar food and taster bites in the rooftop bar), the rooftop bar was a wonderful addition.  The spa?....lovely, pool at perfect temperature.  I loved every second of staying here, and I cant wait to go back!",5,2013,11,10
206,Great stay in a welcoming city,"The Marker was a bit of a surprise. Somehow this hotel has managed to take the service standards associated with Asia Pacific properties, and deliver them in Dublin. 

On checking in, my split stay was combined so that I did not have to check out - I'd had to extend by a night and done that online. 

The room was well furnished, had good tea and coffee, a wifi dedicated to the room (that was fast and free) and I could link my iPad to the TV over wifi without an apple TV. 

The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom spacious and well equipped. 

There was a turn down service each night, and when I did leave some clothes out I found them hung in my wardrobe. Laundry was fast and efficient. 

The breakfasts were self-service buffet and excellent. So good I broke my rule about not having a full cooked breakfast each morning. 

The bar service was good, the drinks well made and served with nibbles.

You do pay for this, but the Marker made every Euro feel well spent. I'd have no issue recommending this hotel.",5,2013,11,09
206,Very good hotel - Staff and Facilities,"We stayed at the marker in october/november 2013. 

The hotel was very clean and brand new, staff was very friendly and responded to our request in a timely manner. 

The room we stayed in was also clean and had internet TV + free wifi. 

The only downside for this hotel is its breakfast, for the amount of money they charge, they should offer a much wider variety.",4,2013,11,07
206,Excellent!,"Excellent hotel, clean, modern and walking distance from the Convention Center, right on the Grand Canal and the theater.  I did not use the gym but my friends did and were very impressed with it overall. The staff was super courteous, helpful and friendly.  The room was excellent!
The hotel is about 15 minutes walk to city center, or 7 euros if taking a Taxi.
Breakfast buffet, bar, business center, everything was good.",5,2013,11,06
206,"Fantastic hotel, staff and facilities","Great location in Dublin city centre, we had a deluxe king room with a great view overlooking the canal and theatre. Staff were extremely helpful from the moment we arrived right until we checked out. Really enjoyed the facilities, swimming pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi. Would have no hesitation recommending the hotel and already looking forward to our next stay there.",5,2013,11,04
206,Can't Wait To Go Back ....,"We, husband and I, have stayed in hotels in NYC, Prague, London,  Amsterdam, France etc - this hotel is THE best EVER! 
It can't be faulted. 
Lovely, friendly, helpful staff. 
Fantastic surroundings.  Brilliant facilities.  Great food.... And oh,
the rooms......
I never sleep well in hotels. Never, ever - I'm like the princess and the pea!
The beds in The Marker are incredible.  
Imagine the most comfortable thing you could ever think of - THAT'S what the beds are like! 
The bathroom,  well, I could have taken it home - it was the height of supreme luxury - and oh SO clean (which does make a difference!)
A joy to stay in,  highly recommended, the ONLY thing is,  it's spoilt us for anything else now  It's set the standard! 
We will definitely be booking again,  for a longer stay next time? 
We only stayed for one night,  (Billy Joel in the O2, which was EXCELLENT!!!)  and The Marker made for the PERFECT stay in Dublin. 
ps. Not forgetting the rooftop bar - Cheers! ",5,2013,11,04
206,Beautiful five-star hotel!,"You just get to love the different ceiling and the big glass sections in the lobby and restaurant. This modern hotel is newly built and still very clean and fresh everywhere you look. The hotel bar is quite nice and if you're lucky (as we were) you get to meet Bono himself chilling with his friends. The room was nice in every way, looking gorgeous and feeling fresh. The only small ""disappointment"" is the breakfast. Even though it was good, it could have been even better, trying to meet the same high standard in everything else in the hotel. You are ten minutes from RDS and fifteen minutes from Temple Bar, by walking. Highly recommended.",5,2013,11,04
206,"Nice, new, modern hotel","We stayed for a weekend. The hotel is a little bit out of the action of Dublin, about a 20 minute walk from Temple Bar. Which was fine for us as we were wanting to walk around the city and see it for ourselves. A taxi is quite expensive and they seem to charge a ‚Ç¨3 fee to pick you up at the hotel.

The hotel is new and very nice. The rooms are a good size, not the biggest 5* rooms I've ever stayed in, but they are very nice. The bathrooms are beautiful and have very good fixtures and fittings.

The bed was big and very comfortable, the hotel was perfectly quiet and we had a great nights sleep.

The pool area is beautiful as well.

The only complaint I would have is the roof top bar. We were told it was full and asked to wait. That was fine, except other people who approached the lift up to the bar were shown straight up with no wait at all. I asked could we go up and again the lady said there was a big queue, yet a group of 6 women entered the hotel minutes later and were shown straight up. Perhaps our faces didn't fit, I've no idea!

Apart from the lady on the door of the roof top bar the hotel was great.",5,2013,11,03
206,Gorgeous hotel,"The hotel was immaculate throughout. It has a great location on the Grand Canal near the theatre.
Very courteous and helpful staff. We have had a very warm welcome of the members of the frontoffice. Also the members of the houskeeping do there job in a perfect way;
The room was excellent. The bathroom was modern and spacious with exclusive products. The rooftop was amazing. It was really a pleasure to swim in the large swimmingpool. We give the hotel a very good value for the breakfast for the quality of food and again for the service.
There is nothing negative at all and we shall definitely stay again!",5,2013,11,03
206,Every aspect perfect......,"Unfortunately only visited for one night as we were going to the Billy Joel concert in the nearby O2. Design and style of this hotel is extremely modern and sharp. Everything on ground floor is open plan giving a great atmosphere. Loved our room - superior double. Bedroom and bathroom had fixtures and fittings of the highest quality. An excellent nights sleep in an extremely comfortable bed.
Rooftop bar was fantastic and we visited before and after the concert ! As it's November we had a seat under the heaters but were also provided with blankets. 
All staff were excellent and training standards were very high. 
So glad to have found something that little bit different - our new 'favourite' I think! Keep up the good work - please!! Be back soon!",5,2013,11,02
206,First Class,"A big big thank you to Unni, Garav, Clara and Adam. We arrived at the hotel at the end of May 2013 and learnt that it had been only open a few weeks and the swimming pool was not open due to maintenance. We were very disappointed but the above staff looked after us arranged alternative swimming facilities and complimentary meal. The service at meal times were impeccable and Adam remembered our particular orders each time we visited the restaurant. Our room was bright, clean and contemporary. We were notified as soon as the pool was available for use and it was one of the nicest layouts that we have experienced. Clara was very friendly and welcoming to the spa. Unni and Garav we are greatful for the hospitality that you showed us and you went over and beyond to ensure that the hotel met our expectations. We will definitely stay with you again and have recommended the hotel to friends. Mr and Mrs Owen",5,2013,11,02
206,Amazing bathroom,"The hotel is situated close to the business and cultural centre of Dublin making it ideal for business travellers. I stayed in this hotel for one night. 

The check-in was somehow a bit convoluted as the person who helped me was also engaged with a different guest at the same time and I was then transferred to another person. In general staff seemed a bit unorganised which one would not expect from a Leading Hotel. 

The room was of a good size with a large bed and some rather funky chairs. Overall a comfortable room if it had not been for the air con. It seemed to be either too cold or stuffy in the room which was not pleasant. A real highlight is the bathroom which is fairly large and beautifully appointed. Bathrobes and slippers are provided. 

I had breakfast and dinner in the hotel both were fine but not outstanding. I did not have time to check out the roof top bar or the pool.

Overall, you will have a pleasant stay there.",4,2013,11,01
206,Excellent,On our recent visit to Dublin we thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of this hotel. Staff are friendly and it's in a nice location by the canal. The rooftop garden is relaxing on a nice evening. We will certainly return.,5,2013,10,29
206,Really nice,"My wife and I stayed here for 1 night when in Dublin fir a friends wedding. We were a bit behind schedule due to traffic, and on arrival the guy at the front door was extremely helpful he got us checked in really quick and arranged sone other things for us. The room was lovely very clean and bright. We found all the staff that we encountered polite and helpful. The hotel I feel offers value for money as a five star and I would definately have no hesitation in returning.",5,2013,10,27
206,Fantastic 5 in every way,"Stayed at this hotel now twice with my husband whilst he was on business.

Every aspect of this beautiful modern hotel is worth praising. The staff are exceptional. Always service with a smile. We had a corner room and it was huge. Bed was the most comfortable we have ever slept in.

The spa is gorgeous. Lovely steam and sauna rooms and pool. We also went onto roof top and had a drink. 

Special thanks go to LIli for making our stay so enjoyable
Cannot wait to return soon.",5,2013,10,27
206,Fabulous pampering experience,"We went for the weekend to celebrate my husbands birthday and we were looking for something a bit special... We certainly found it at The Marker!! Contempory and quirky design, beautiful and comfy rooms, amazing breakfast, luxurious spa and treatment, lively atmosphere in bar and restaurant... The list goes on! 
The service we received was fabulous too, it was all the little touches that made the difference. For example the restaurant had been fully booked the night we arrived, my fault as I only tried to book it the day before, so when we arrived to check in the restaurant manager Roderick arrived apologising that the restaurant had been full and offered us complimentary champagne and whisked us upstairs to the rooftop bar where he had reserved a table.Everyone seemed to be expecting us and knew it was my husbands birthday, it was seemless. There was complimentary champagne the next evening and a lovely cake as a birthday surprise for my husband... All without asking, how fab was that!! 
We loved the location too, ok so it's not city centre but a 5 min walk takes you to the Luas and 20 mins to Temple Bar but that didn't matter. The area is up and coming and has a cool quirky vibe with lots of great restaurants and bars dotted around the docks just outside the door plus the theatre is also quite literally on the doorstep, so close you don't even need a coat! 
We can't say enough good things about this new hotel... It's not a question of if we will go back but when!!! I can't wait!!!
",5,2013,10,24
206,Exemplary,"Enjoyed a 2 night stay with my partner. From the moment we set eyes on the hotel everything was exemplary. Check in was quick and efficient with a warm genuine smile and a greeting from the reception ladies and help with our bags from the doorman who absolutely insisted on carrying our heavy bags, they really went out of the way to make an excellent first impression and that they did. From there on out our stay was exactly the same. 

The room was large and spacious and we both agreed the bed was the most comfortable we had ever slept in. The bathroom was absolutely beautiful and the view from our room over grand canal dock was beautiful especially at night, it made our stay even more romantic. It really was the small things about the room that made it even more fabulous such as the malin and goetz toiletries and the plate of beautiful small desserts waiting for us upon arrival.

The service and food in the bar lounge was quick and excellent, we were made to feel at home. The beef burger and lamb koftas were excellent and not at all the standard of what you expect from hotel lounge food. Coffees were perfectly brewed and beautifully present with the art on top. All for excellent value! 

The real gem of this hotel has to be the rooftop bar. We were lucky to have stayed while the weather was excellent. The views are spectacular and so was the service and staff. Every member of the staff went out of their way to make sure we were looked after and comfortable while there, even giving us blankets and moving us under the heated area when it became cool in the evening. We didnt have to ask for a thing, they were always one step ahead. The cocktails were excellent and the food on the tasting plate menu was just perfect to share and pick at, unbelievably tasty too.

Nearly had to be dragged out of the hotel upon check out, Just didnt want to leave. Thank you for a wonderful stay, we cant wait to return.",5,2013,10,22
206,great hotel,"Had 2 nights stay very good hotel. Very modern with fantastic rooms and very comfy beds. 
Fantastic bar area with good selection of drinks, Food was very good at breakfast and casual in bar area. All staff very attentive and friendly 
Only down side bit far from downtown but all the good out weighs that.",5,2013,10,22
206,Brilliant stay... Will definitely return.,"I stayed here at the weekend.
The staff are brilliant and very attentive.
Pool area and relaxation rooms are excellent.
The Roof Top bar is a must. Good beer menu and good cocktails too.
I've stayed here before and will definitely return.",5,2013,10,21
206,Dublin luxury,"My sister and I recently enjoyed 4 days in Dublin and chose to stay at The Marker hotel on Grand Canal Square. From our arrival to departure it was luxury all the way at this new and very modern hotel. All the staff were extremely polite, professional and very helpful - nothing was too much trouble. The Spa & Wellness centre was beautiful and for most of our daily visits we had the place to ourselves - a wonderful experience. We were staying on a room only basis, but ate at least one meal a day at the hotel in the bar area, where the food and service was extremely good and the prices very reasonable. Our twin bedded room was lovely, beautifully decorated with sumptuous carpeting throughout including the hallway, the beautiful bathroom had a very large bath and a large separate shower cubicle, however our only complaint was with the smell from the shower which was a damp, mush odour when the air conditioning was turned off. I believe this to be a design fault with the room as the smell was not so obvious if the bathroom door was left open thereby creating a through airflow.  This was not a cheap hotel but very worthwhile spending that bit extra for a treat and because of the hotel's location in this newly developed area which included the beautiful Bord Gais EnergyTheatre across the piazza, we were able to see the opening night of Priscilla Queen of the Desert, which was absolutely brilliant!",5,2013,10,19
206,One of my Favorite Hotel Stays EVER!,"I do a lot of business travel and am afforded the opportunity to stay in nicer hotels around the world.  Besides an amazing stay in the Grand Hyatt in Tokyo, this bar far is one of my favorite hotels I have ever stayed in.  Rooms were amazingly spacious.  Bathrooms had heated tile floors (YES!!!), views of the quay was nice, staff were all polite and courteous, and the rooftop bar was beyond compare!  

I can usually write a long-winded review detailing everything and pick little things apart.  Not here.  I was thoroughly impressed and am excited with the opportunity to visit again in a couple of months!  Not much else to say!

The only thing negative I would have to say about this hotel is its proximity to downtown.  I can't really complain too much, though, as it was a five minute walk to my office.  :-)",5,2013,10,18
206,Best!!!,Best hotel i have been so far! Amazing stylish modern hotel! Staff is friendliest and most helpful ever! Highly reccommended!!!! everything in this hotel is thought through. Rooftop is just breath takin cool ! going to return soon again...,5,2013,10,15
206,Great experience,"Friendly, welcoming service, lovely room, beautiful pool. It was also one of the only hotels I've ever stayed in where I wasn't woken by noises through the night, so I presume they got the soundproofing right! If you want to sample the rooftop bar though, make sure and ring ahead to book a seat! It's pricey but the cocktails are fab.",5,2013,10,15
206,Very Modern and Great Stay,"Really liked this hotel, nice and modern, right next to the water.  Room was decent sized, great bathroom although the shower would flood the bathroom a bit.  Bed was comfortable and room service was great.  Staff needed to be a bit more knowledagble about tourist activities and things.  I got poor information about the hop on-hop off bus which they should have known better.  Overall nice hotel and I would stay here again.",4,2013,10,14
206,Best service yet,"Spent last night at The Marker and will definitely be back.
Came across the hotel on the web and booked to try a something new.
Unbelievably convenient to theatre (next door, 25m away) which was the reason for our visit (heartbeat of home) and Grafton St only 20mins brisk walk away. 
The building, public spaces, bedrooms were all as you'd expect for a 5* hotel, but the level of service from all of the staff we encountered was exemplary.
Never before have we been asked would we like a towel and water on our return from a morning run!
We will be back.",5,2013,10,13
206,Fabulous,"Checked in for one nights stay and to catch Micky Flanagan at the O2. Fabulous is the only way to describe it. Fantastic setting, staff were unobtrusive yet always on hand if required and extremely pleasant. Gorgeous superior king room and very tasty breakfast this morning. Can't find a fault. We will be back!",5,2013,10,13
206,Birthday treat,Went for birthday dinner. Had amazing saffron risotto. Just amazing. Lovely bottle of wine. Ordered desert and they had written happy birthday in chocolate on the side of the plate. Finished off with a G&T in the bar. Gorgeous building and stunning bedrooms and spa.  Highly recommended,5,2013,10,10
206,"Great service,they try really hard","We usually stay at The Gresham for its central location  but decided to try The Marker. Really nicely done out, super friendly service and nice room . A whole different experience to The Gresham and there really is no comparison. The location is great but not as central as it could be, but everything is only a short distance away. I would highly recommend the hotel , it would be even better if the prices were  10 to 15% cheaper!",4,2013,10,10
206,Fantastic contemporary Hotel,"Used The Marker for one night whilst on business in Dublin, situated in the smart Docklands area so a 10 minute cab ride from the hearty of the city.I was greated with fantastically hospitable doormen and reception staff and treasted to as slick a check in process as I have had. The Marker is beautifully designed with extremely mascualine contempory features such as the deep balck panelled lobby and corridors but with a glassy and light and open reception, bar reception space. I used the restaurant area for breakfast which was self service but of high quality.
Rooms are of good size I was on the top floor (6th) which had a fantastic if not somewhat dark walk in shower wet room. King sized beds extremely comfortable and a nice size working area with great views across the designer docks to the country way beyond..
I wish I had more than 24 hours to stay here..",5,2013,10,10
206,Wow!,"Just back from a fantastic weekend there,everything was wonderful. The rooftop bar is a must-see and yes service can be a bit slow but just relax and enjoy. The staff are all lovely and extremely helpful. Can't recommend it highly enough",5,2013,10,09
206,Amazing Night!!!,"First class treatment on Friday night at the Marker hotel. The Staff were so professional and attentive. We were brought up to the Roof Top Bar and greeted with cocktails followed by amazing food, everything was state of the art and a credit to the head chef Gareth Mullins. Thanks to Gareth and all his staff for a Fabulous night we will definitely be back soon to try the Restraunt..",5,2013,10,09
206,Fun and fabulous,"A new hotel with great decor and rooftop bar. Rooms clean and comfortable with good air conditioning and wonderful bathroom. Comfortable bed and a great view of the canal. If I had one criticism it would be staff, although it was a new hotel and they may still be finding their feet, check in/out was laboriously slow and again in the bar service could be slow with a bit of added attitude but the was very dependant on bar person as we managed by the end of our stay to find a friendly chap who definitely added to our evening bar experience and overall stay-one of those staff who made everything alright! 
Fabulous location and overall will definitely be back!!",4,2013,10,07
206,Beautiful Hotel,"We checked into the Marker Hotel on Saturday 5th and had a wonderful stay... They view from our room on the 5th floor was great over the Quay.... By far the best wifi in any hotel I stayed in and the best tv which is quick and fully functional even for internet... 

The room was very well designed and very comfortable and the Bathroom was first class.....

After eating out for dinner we returned to the rooftop bar and the service we received from Catherine and all the staff was great... (Consistency of Cocktails were poor) but other than that no other real fault...

Definitely will return and thanks to Gary for sorting out the overcharge in the Q Park Car Park...

Will definitely return...",5,2013,10,06
206,The Grand Marker Hotel,"This was my 1st experience of staying at this hotel. I was greeted very warmly by the receptionist - She was professional and friendly. My room was on the 5th Floor over looking the Canal. I arrived late in the evening and overlooked a very well lit up area beside the theatre. 
Morning breakfast was amazing. The food was of the highest standard with an wonderful choice of cuisine. The Staff were attentive to all my needs.
Later I went to the well equipped gym and infinity pool / steam room / Sauna and jacuzzi. Everything was state of the art and again the staff were so attentive to ensure I had everything I needed or wanted. 
My bedroom was a good size with a beautiful en-suite bathroom. 
It took me only 20 minutes to walk to O'Connell Street / Grafton Street.
Yes I will be back.",5,2013,10,06
206,Brilliant ,"I loved this joint. It wasn't cheap but was one classy place, truly a five star establishment. From the moment you arrive you are greeted by the friendly doormen and are treated like a star. The rooms are very modern and cool with noir hallways. We had a deluxe corner room for our last night which was very luxurious. The upstairs, rooftop bar was fantastic although not that well designed for the Irish weather. But I can't fault the staff. They were all 'bend over backwards' to do anything for you. It's certainly an asset to the Dublin hotel scene and if I can afford to I will stay there again. The breakfast buffet is out of this world, as are their cocktails. It's new, sexy and well worth it!  ",5,2013,10,06
206,Can't wait to go back!,"We stayed recently whilst visiting Dublin for my birthday. We looked on lots of different sites because we wanted to stay somewhere modern but 'special' and it did not disappoint! The room was very luxurious and comfy, we were very relaxed especially after the lavender dreams massage, amazing. The best thing was the service from the staff, they were all delightful and nothing was too much trouble. Gary at the roof top bar was very welcoming and surprised me with a birthday dessert whilst we had a cocktail overlooking Dublin. We cannot wait to return again. Highly recommended hotel, thank you!",5,2013,10,05
206,Great Stay!,"My husband, 1-yr old daughter and I stayed at the Marker recently on our last night in Ireland.  The hotel was easy to get to and centrally located within the city. We were greeted at the door by friendly and helpful staff.  The room was absolutely spotless and equipped with many helpful extras like Smart TV, iPod charger, complimentary water, slippers and robes for use and a spacious bathroom with separate tub and shower.  The staff quickly accommodated our request for a crib and showed us where to find the spa where we enjoyed a swim the large pool.  Common areas were also well-furnished, very comfortable and clean.  The bedding (I'm overly picky about hotel beds) was white, crisp, clean, soft, warm and made for a peaceful night's rest. We had a fantastic stay at the Marker and would highly recommend it!",5,2013,10,02
206,Avoid,"Stayed early august for a short break weekend and will not return. Terribly rude staff, in an unsafe area in Dublin. Once inside the hotel your safe but outside the front door beware. Locals for security guards should give it away what they're trying to hide. Very expensive  Brand new and very clean but service and price kill it all. Best part is on departure we were asked to write a positive tripadvisor review by the receptionist. Can't comment on food as had none and rooftop bar was too full to get in even for high paying guest. A joke. Will not return and will not recommend. Karen",1,2013,10,02
206,Stunning Views but as a Newborn there are some Teething Problems,"The Marker is perfectly positioned for those wanting to take in a show at the Bord Gais Energy Theatre (and there's a terrific tapas restaurant, H's Cafe Bar, a stone's throw from the hotel's main entrance). The hotel itself is brand new, so understandably there are a few teething problems, mainly minor things like we didn't have a room service menu in our room, there was no where to sit and do your make-up in the bedroom, and as it's a minimalist design, it can take some time trying to find certain items as they've all been cleverly hidden out of sight. We'd also been hoping to take in the Roof Top Bar but were advised it closes at 11pm for safety reasons. In general, the hotel was clean, the staff were pleasant and for a 5-star hotel in the centre of Dublin, it was quite keenly priced (we booked through Booking.com). I would give it a 3.5 out of 5, 'average' isn't quite good enough and 'very good' is, at the moment, overselling it. However, I'm returning on 19th October, so hopefully things will have improved.",4,2013,10,02
206,Terrible,This hotel looks great but that's where it ends. Had already paid for the room when I arrived. On arrival was told to provide a card to cover mini bar costs which I obliged. The member of staff insisted that the card I provided when I arrived would not be debited unless I used the mini bar. Stayed in the hotel for 4 nights. I arrived home to find that the hotel had charged the full amount of my stay on to my mini bar card (gone over its credit limit). Its a total disgrace and as far as I am concerned the staff may look professional but have no idea what they are doing. Will stay at the Gibson next time.,1,2013,10,01
206,Setting a Mark,"A smart new hotel overlooking the cosmopolitan Grand Canal Square next door to the Bord GaisTheatre. Excellent staff, though not a single membger we met was Irish. So it felt like an overseas city-break without having to endure ryanair to get there! Good value pre-theatre brazzerie with attentive and not intrusive service. (Take a bow, maitre-d). Very nice room, comfortble bed, great bathroom with 'soft' irish water. Plenty of space so even super-sized guests should be comfortable. Only frustration was that windows are sealed and the air quality was pretty hot and stale for us country-bumkins. Despite turning air-con control to minimum and fan to max (so it intruded) the air was only cool by morning and never seemed fresh. Maybe we just failed to sus the controls?. The Smart TV would have been child's play to my 5yr old grandaughter but other than for TV, it defeated me entirely !  The Marker was a step up from what we normally seek. Prob has a lot more to offer than we knew how or had time to enjoy (guest guide lurks somewhere within in TV's smartness?!).  We will come back sometime for another special occasion and plan for more than just a theatre night.",5,2013,10,01
206,Truly fab hotel,"Stayed here while in Dublin for a match, so impressed with the hotel, we will definately be back. Hotel was well sign posted and easy to find in a lovely setting.  Rooms are fab and the beds are the most cosy I have slept in. Breakfast buffet was excellent, can't wait to stay here again.",5,2013,09,29
206,"superb hotel,  staff and food","As a regular traveler im used to being disappointed by expensive hotels. Not so for the Marker. Quiet, comfortable and best amenities in a hotel!  Raw sugar for plunger coffee. Skin friendly toiletries. Fantastic to see a hotel that practices what it preaches! Food heavenly. .fresh ingredients and staff just the right amount of 'friendly'.
Room spacious and well set out. Awesome views of canal.",5,2013,09,29
206,Top class,"I was very pleasantly surprised by the Marker. I had a one-night stay in Dublin and randomly picked the Marker for the stay. I have to say it's as good as anything I have stayed at, certainly anywhere in Europe. Very comfortable, modern decor, nice rooftop bar, good gym and pool. The staff were very pleasant and helpful, and gave good recommendations on restaurants. They did seem to be largely working from a rote script and seemed a bit stiff as a result, but I'd rather have that than the service I was used to receiving ten years ago in Irish hotels. The staff were obviously well trained and went out of their way to be helpful. When I was in the rooftop bar and realized I'd left my sunglasses in the car that I'd valeted, rather than just pulling the car around for me they delivered the sunglasses to me on the roof. Nicely done. Overall a top notch effort and I would recommend the place. I'll stay there again the next time I have a night in Dublin. For tourists, it's a bit of a walk into the city center and the area it's in does not feel like the ""real Dublin"" if such a thing still exists, but it is within walking or easy taxi distance, I'd rather trade the city center for a really nice, comfortable, clean hotel and a great stay.",5,2013,09,28
206,Highly recommend,"The staff were superb, very friendly and helpful. Only stayed one night but was very impressed generally. Breakfast was plentiful and good. The place was well designed and different. Only problem was getting into the room as was waiting for it to be cleaned.",5,2013,09,28
206,Way over priced,"The interior design of the hotel is abismal. There is no power socket by any of the mirrors you can hook the hair dryers to. The rooms may have decent square meterage but it is used up in a long thin room. When you pay in excess of ¬£250 per night you should expect a lot more for your money. Its a good 20 minute walk from town (and I walk fast to the point of making companions sweat and get out of breath). The staff however are very nice, attentive and friendly. They're just let down by some of the worst interior design I've ever seen. The bathrooms pretty much floodw when the shower is used as the stupid glass screen only covers half the bath. You cant leave your washbag on any of the shelves in the bathroom either as they are too thin to place anything beyond your toothbrush on them. The bath with the shower also has nothing to grab hold of when your trying to get in and out. Add to that the high wall on the bath and its a recipe for disaster unless you have the balance of a tightrope walker. Also, dont stay in summer. The room was too hot so we left the card in the slot while we went out with the air con on full blast and it was still like a sauner when we got back 4 hours later. Thats september aswell 17 degrees Celsius outside. We only stayed the one night. Spent an extra 30 quid and got a suite in the westbury the next night. Right on grafton street. Seriously I dont know how they justify the price here. Thats a deluxe king roon by the way. Not the standard ones. Just avoid it if possible",2,2013,09,27
206,Excellent overall experience,Would highly recommend this very impressive hotel. Excellent service. Beautiful rooms. Very helpful front of house staff. Take care parking not included. Huge bathroom. 20 min walk from centre of Dublin. Young up and coming trendy area.,5,2013,09,27
206,High Quality Great for Dublin Touring,"Stayed here two nights in September.  Wanted a fairly new, modern conveniences, quiet hotel close enough to Dublin tourist attractions.  The Marker didn't dissappoint.  Wished I could have stayed here my entire time in Ireland. If you need to leave before the breakfast kitchen opens up, they will serve you a continental breakfast to your room. Everyone who worked there was friendly and very helpful. Enjoyed it!",5,2013,09,26
206,well done,"The hotel was excellent! We enjoyed our two nights there, and we never experienced a misstep. Everything was perfect, and everyone who worked there was friendly and very helpful. Well done. I looking forward to next visit",5,2013,09,24
206,A home away from home in Dublin,"My husband and I recently spent a week in Dublin as he was there for business and we picked this hotel for its location as it is just a few blocks from his office.  Although the hotel is not in directly in the city centre it is only a 20 minute walk/5 minute taxi ride away.  I especially liked the location of the hotel as it is situated right on the Grand Canal and surrounded by a few nice restaurants/coffee shops and a grocery store down the street.  I was able to make use of the fitness facilities and must admit I enjoyed the treadmill with the Hiking Trail feature that let you pick from a wide assortment of trails across the world to simulate as you ran.  The gym was clean and well stocked with a water cooler, towels and fruit.

Room service was great and we enjoyed the options for lunch and dinner as well as the selection of Killowen Yogurts which my husband and I found particularly addicting(especially the Lemon Curd).  The breakfast wasn't so great, as the selection was minimal and wasn't to my liking and wasn't well stocked, but I will say it was popular on the weekends as it was quite busy and there was usually a wait for a table.    

The rooms were great, we stayed in a corner suite and it was quite spacious (not the best views as we were on the 1st floor) but the washroom was immaculate with a great soaking tub and a separate shower with 2 shower heads, one directly above that was like a rain shower and another across from you. The toiletries available were also of high quality and readily available.

Finally, the service was great, we had no complaints, there was always bottles of water and fruit available in the morning on our way out which was a nice touch.

I recommend the hotel for any business travelers or couples/families looking for a relaxing escape in Dublin.",5,2013,09,24
206,A quirky modern hotel a little outside Dublin's centre bustle,"We stayed for 1 night in a deluxe canal-view room on the 3rd floor The room was a nice size and everything was new and spotless. The staff were very pleasant and even offered a bed turn own service! Our visit was to see a show in the O2 which was about 20 mins walk away, all on the flat, The roads in Dublin are very busy especially at weekends, so walking is usually a quicker option. There are pony and trap rides, taxis and even ' tuk-tuk ' rides around the canal walk area to help you get around. Cycles and electric bikes can be hired  and a fun viking theme trip on a amphibious bus that tours the Grand Canal square area.There's hop on/off bus tours, many buses ,taxis a central tram route, but the one way system is a nightmare to get around at eak time.
We didn't eat here as we ate out,there was a mini bar in the room. We din't use the spa or visit the bars either",4,2013,09,23
206,Room to improve but staff are excellent,"Staff can make or break a hotel. The Marker has well-trained staff with a culture of courtesy and helpfulness. We were happy with the staff but the hotel, which is only a few months old, needs a few improvements before it ranks with the world's five-star lodgings.
If you're looking for a hotel close to all the action, this isn't it, but there are plenty of cabs to get you there.
Overall, we were happy but I offer the following tips for the management:
1.The rubber mats in the shower are not a good idea and the tiles should be replaced with non-slip tiles.  Also, water flows under the shower walls somehow and makes a mess of the bathroom.
2. Likewise, the tiles at poolside are incredibly slippery and I don't think putting a sign up that says so is the best way to deal with that.
3. There is virtually NO storage in the hotel rooms. There is a narrow wardrobe, consumed by two oversized bathrobes, and there are two very shallow drawers. The bedside tables could easily have had a drawer under them. Most 5-star hotels have a tallboy or similar. My fellow guests from the conference were similarly exasperated with this. We stayed more than a week and had to live out of our suitcases. Ordinarily, we would unpack.
4. There was a lack of information in the room about the local area. There should be at least maps and a list of places to buy essentials. Not everyone consults the concierge at all hours. We had no idea on the first night that we had a grocery store and a convenience store within 3 minutes' walk. Silly us, we trudged for more than an hour. (our fault, I know, but we would have preferred in-room info).
5. Staff should not knock on our door when we have a do not disturb sign on there.
6. Scrambled eggs should be able to be picked up with a fork. They were always runny.
7. The staff were very polite at breakfast but we hardly ever got toast and had to ask for coffee. Sometimes we were asked if we wanted it but no one came back with it. Two mornings, we left without either.
Those comments are for the management but for those of you thinking of staying at The Marker, I would stress that it is clean, quiet, comfortable and friendly. The beds were very comfortable and the pool and gym and facilities are good.  If you do have a problem and if you mention it to the staff, they are swift to try to correct it for you.
Our first room had a broken airconditioner so they promptly moved us.",4,2013,09,23
206,Fabulous trendy oasis in docklands area,"Chosen based on proximity to convention centre.
Pleasantly surprised.
Part of leading hotels of the world group.
Amazing room, spacious, grand and well set out.
Beautiful bathroom, lovely amenities.
Great on site restaurant.... Breakfast expensive but wide selection.
Pre theatre dinner much better value. 2 course for ‚Ç¨25 or 3 for ‚Ç¨29
5 nights here was a great little break. Not to mention Dublin on your doorstep.
Would highly recommend.",5,2013,09,21
206,Its where its at in Dublin,"Was attending conference at Convention Centre so Idea. Loved the shole doclands vibe; makes the city centre Liffey district look very run down in comparison
Warmed by the rom upgrade on arrival. Love the communal areas especially the roof terrace which benefitted from a but if Indian Summer and the Moon being on show every night.
My only critisism would be the breakfast. Having stayed in many hotels of similar calibre I thought having the hot al la carte breakfast items as extra let the breakfast offering down The hot breakfast buffet component was only of premier inn ilk! The rest was excellent. As with all slip ups the management seem to act on it- Do it it will reap rewards. Having choice and being waited on are part of the high star experience.",5,2013,09,21
206,In my top 5 of new favorite hotels!,"I stayed at The Marker Hotel from the 5th of september till the 9th of september. Before my stay i had never heard of this hotel so i didnt know what to expect. From the first till the last minute the service was just perfect. The manager Gaurav was really helpfull and made our stay flawless. He checked every morning at breakfast if everything was ok and if we came in late he checked how our day was. He also had very good suggestion of things we could do. The hotel itself is gorgeous, our room was spacious and the bathroom every girls dream :). The rooftop bar is a great place to have a drink. Breakfast and dinner at the hotel is also great, no complaints. The location is very handy because all public transport is within walking distance and if its not raining you can walk to the city instead of taking public transport. I will definitly in the future stay here again. Loved it, its in my top 5 now which includes The Grand Hyatt singapore and The Marina Bay Sands so that says it all ;).",5,2013,09,20
206,Outstanding staff and service but the devil is in the details.,"This is a beautiful new hotel with excellent facilities in a good location especially for the Conference Center. The rooms are large, beautifully appointed and extremely comfortable . The bathroom was incredible with the most gorgeous sink I've ever seen.The pool was great and I had it all to myself!
But for me what made our experience really special was the warm and professional service of the staff. This started with the welcome, and continued throughout our stay. Breakfast and room staff were friendly and capable. The doorman was extremely kind in helping with our departure. Food on the rooftop bar was excellent and the host brought us blankets as the evening was chilly. Everyone was wonderful to us and made us feel right at home and cared for.
There was one very tiny detail that meant I couldn't give the top rating. At breakfast, lovely by the way, there is a cheese tray with bits of celery and fruit that are really there for decoration. All the same that celery must have been around for ages. It was dried out and brown at the edges-gross. When I was finishing my coffee my breakfast lady asked if everything was satisfactory and I told her about the celery. She thanked me and went over to the cheese board, gasped and spoke to one of her colleagues. The cheese tray was removed. Very satisfying especially as she came back and thanked me again. Sad to say, next morning the same celery was back. Such a small thing but for a hotel of this caliber, maybe not. The devil is in the details.",4,2013,09,19
206,Superb hotel in a great location!,"My partner and I stayed here on a recent Sunday.  While I went to a match in Croke Park, my partner enjoyed a relaxing day in the hotel.  This hotel is located in a very upcoming, trendy part of Dublin and there a lovely vibe around.  Lots of great restaurants and bars about and lovely views of the water and the city.  The room was beautifully appointed and large, everything very shiny and new as it is only recently opened.  Bed was extremely comfortable, fluffy bathrobes and slippers and a fridge with a mini-bar and space for extras.  I returned early evening and we went for a few drinks and food in the locality.  The hotel seems expensive but we got a great deal on trivago.  Spa and pool looked amazing.  I would definitely recommend and return. Service excellent.  The only negative as parking at ‚Ç¨30 overnight and car park is oddly located and hard to find.",4,2013,09,17
206,Really stylish spot with great service,I hosted a client drinks reception in a suite on the 6th floor to coincide with the Dublin Flightfest. The management and staff were extremely professional and the service was excellent. The hotel itself is impeccable and the rooms are spacious and stylish. I will definitely be returning.,4,2013,09,17
206,Fabtastic 4-day stay at The Marker in Dublin,"I recently spent 3 nights at The Marker in Dublin. It is fantastic. Very modern and fresh; the lobby is huge and the bar is basically in the lobby which gives the place a great atmosphere. We had a super king bed, beautiful marble bathroom (with large shower and a separate bath - water pressure was great!). The rooms are quiet and dark. The staff are great - we had our 9-month old daughter with us and people could not have been more helpful including finding a lost toy for us.I have read a couple of reviews on here from the same weekend we stayed at the hotel and I can't understand where they are coming from. Breakfast was excellent - there's a beautifually presented cold and hot buffet with lovely Irish meats, puddings and potato scones, great fruit, cheeses, juices etc etc and an a la carte menu - we ordered off both and all food was good. I'd struggle to fault the place. The roof top bar was closed one evening for a private function but thats understandable - this place is a desireable 'go to' venue for Dubliners too (I am from there) - its by far the trendiest and most interesting spot in Dublin at the moment. The spa is gorgeous!",5,2013,09,17
206,Do not waste your hard earned money,"I was so excited to stay in the newest most modern hotel in Dublin.  I had goggled the hotel and the roof top bar looked amazing as did the rest of the hotel, well that's where the fantasy ended and I won't say nightmare began but it was close. Arrived to hotel early and our rooms (3) were ready yahoo you say, as did we but the porter wasn't as happy to see us he suggested we (7 of us) put our bags in 1 room.... No2 went down for drink in lobby bar and sorry no table available ( roof top bar closed for private function), so sat in lobby for about 15 min waiting  for table and no one came near us. Next morning all was forgiven as we spent a wonderful night in another 5 star hotel and arrived for breakfast which I kid you not consisted of muesli, natural yogurt, melon and scrambled egg oh sorry forgot the uncooked rashers. When we complained, staff member said we are so sorry kitchen is manic. Complained to anyone who would listen and all apologised but that was it.  If you are going to Dublin there are plenty of amazing hotels you can stay in, avoid The Marker. ",1,2013,09,16
206,Great hotel brilliant staff,"Had two lovely nights at the Marker.
We visited the roof top bar and it really has spectacular views and a great atmosphere. It was a bit chilly but they provide lovely blankets to take the chill off. Cocktails seem expensive till you taste them and realise they are very strong. 
Used the spa and that's top class.
It was Steves birthday and we got a nice upgrade and a lovely cake from the management.
All the staff are very efficient and there's plenty off them.
Only bad thing we noticed was Sunday breakfast. We arrived at 9 and were well looked after, but we noticed lots of others arrive later and it looked like the staff were struggling to keep up.
We will definitely return",5,2013,09,16
206,Definitely not five star & shocking shocking breakfast !,"I never say this... but yes I have stayed in plenty 5 star hotel around the world.... but I have also stayed in plenty 3 & 4 star. This hotel takes the all time prize for a complete shambles at breakfast. 
Cutting a long & abysmal story short, at 9:45 we arrived for breakfast we 'hailed' for coffee, I ordered from the menu & waited 40mins for a toasted bagel. My friends (on another table who arrived at 9:30)waited 40 mins for poached eggs. My friends who went to the hot buffet got scrambled eggs. Everything else was empty. Cold buffet had 3 croissants, yoghurt & melon. Pastries were not replenished.Meats & cheese were empty apart from about 5 pieces of salami. Cheese was replenished but looked to be just about 12 chunks of hard cheese, no selection. The queue of people for irish breakfast applauded when a plate of sausages arrived to the hot plate. All items of a full breakfast were not available at any point in time. 
It was an operational disaster & such a shambles could not be a once off.
Incidentally this all takes place in an extension of the lobby which is like a cafe.
The bar is an extension of the lobby at the other side & on the previous evening at 6:30 we couldn't get a seat for a drink there. This happens, but when 3 'attendants' asked us if they could help yet no results.
Rooms are fine, clean, short beds & small black bathroom was not attractive.
Location is next to Grand Canal theatre, ‚Ç¨15 taxi from Train station, near business district so therefore nothing happening in the evening. The theatre does not mean there is a bustling night life.
The other 5 stars in Dublin are really under no threat from this hotel. We were in 2 other five stars during our trip to Dublin & there is no comparison.
Modern architecture... yes fine, minimalist hotel yes... but no attractive features. Mediocre seating at reception area. All in all the breakfast left a very bad taste... or little of no taste in our mouths!!!",2,2013,09,16
206,"Disappointing and not 5 star, lovely staff tho!","A group of us stayed for a friends 40th last night and we all left pretty disappointed. The roof terrace was closed for a private event - it felt a bit like being invited to stay in someones house and being told that you couldn't join the party going on in the next room. Apparently this is pretty common and yes its a disclaimer on the site that it is not always available - so why then use it in practically every photo to market the hotel when the likelihood is that your residents won't get to use it? 2 of us went for a drink after we arrived and we couldn't find a seat so ended up outside (a server offered that we could join some people at a communal table either) Very little seating available for the size of hotel (when the roof terrace not available). The breakfast rate is ‚Ç¨15 if you pre book, ‚Ç¨19.50 on the morning or ‚Ç¨24 for room service - our room didn't eat there but the others did and it was farcical. Felt sorry for the staff as they were busy dealing with customer complaints either side of us. Disappointed that all we were offered was an apology and a complimentary upgrade the next time we stay - we won't be taking them up on that ;)",2,2013,09,15
206,A fabulous hotel,"I stayed at the marker for two nights this September, my room was spacious and furnished to perfection with a luxurious bathroom. The hotel is contemporary and staff are extremely respectful which ensured my stay felt very special.",5,2013,09,13
206,Fantastic Hotel,Fantastic Hotel in a fantastic location with our room looking out over Grand Canal Square. Dropped my car outside which was immediately picked up and parked. Had an issue with the prepaid booking/payment which was immediately sorted.  Will be back!,5,2013,09,13
206,Great Hotel,"I really like this hotel - excellent service, great room and amenities, wonderful spa and relaxation area, and in a really good location in the city. Didn't get to try the roof top bar, but heard it is well worth a visit for a cocktail of an evening and will be back to try it out!- would definitely recommend",5,2013,09,11
206,Great new addition to hotel offering in Dublin.,"While all the trappings of a 5* hotel are here a few things make the Marker stand out.
I honestly think the bed was the most comfortable we've ever slept in and loved the way the hospitality tray cupboard lights up when you open the door. Saves fumbling about in the dark or wakening up your partner!
However, what really makes this hotel stand out from its city centre competitors is the roof top bar. Watched the sun set over the city last night while the staff provided first class service and blankets.
Would definitely stay next time we return.",5,2013,09,11
206,Exceptional Service.,"Service was amazing from check in to check out.
Every part of the hotel we presented ourselves to we were met with kind service from all staff.
Cleanliness was brilliant.

WiFi available on the TV if you didn't bring a laptop or tablet. Very fast speeds.
It is also available everywhere in the hotel.
Room was well kept and no major problems(Deluxe room with grand canal view)
I do agree with other reviewers where they say the air conditioning was noisy and difficult to control.

Got the urban escape package with my girlfriend and we thought the facilities were lovely.
I definitely recommend the spa and use of the infinity pool. Floor is very slippy and this is highlighted throughout. So take good care when walking around.

We were booked for two separate treatments when I was looking for both of us to be in the couples treatment room together. I inquired about this and Komal, who was taking care of this, rectified it immediately and got us both together as this was what we really wanted.

There are 3 Relaxation rooms before and after treatments,each are wonderful.
We chose the hanging cacoons which were really fun and good to chill-out in.
Drinks were supplied while we were waiting to be seen and after we had finished.

Dinner was delicious , I recommend use of the A la carte breakfast in the morning instead of the buffet as there might not be a lot to choose from.
Big thank you to the manager Roderick who made are stay very comfortable and easy going. Also to the two masseuses on a terrific job at making us feel deeply relaxed :).

The pictures on here and on its own website don't do itself justice, they should really take more high quality pictures of every part of the building to let people see because I think it would help customers in making there choice a lot easier if they go for looks. I have decided to upload 3 pictures that might help people.

Hope to treat myself again some time soon as I would love to stay there again.",5,2013,09,10
206,Great new hotel,Cool property with great roof top bar.  Highly recommend the spa as well!  Rooms are small but with great bathrooms.  Service was good. Only negative was the difficulty in getting a reservation for a spa treatment - book well in advance!,4,2013,09,10
206,Pleasant stay at the Marker,"Stayed here for 2 nights with my other half. Room was comfortable and had everything we needed. Bed especially good! We ate in the bar one night and restaurant the other. Food was good both times. I thought the service was excellent-have some tricky dietary requirements and was very well catered for by the staff.  
Never had breakfast so can't comment on that. The rooftop bar was lovely on a sunny afternoon. One possible negative is the spa. Had a very poor massage-therapist didn't seem confident at all. Facilities are okay-nice pool if a bit small. The relaxation area is awful though-beanbags and awkward swings for four people. Very bad for your back. There are two loungers-it was quiet when I was there so got to use them but honestly couldn't have used the other seating-very weird. Also kids allowed in the pool quite extensive hours so check times before you book as it is small and not very relaxing if there's a noisy family in... Overall a nice place to stay. A few places to eat nearby if you fancy a change and don't want to head back up the quays to the city centre. ",4,2013,09,10
206,Let down on detail,"Generally the Marker is a good and stylish hotel, but it is let down on detail.

We had a corner suite for four days - all, says the website, with magnificent views of the water.   Well, that was true for our room if you craned your neck and looked sideways from the window, but otherwise the view was of other buiildings.   What made it a 'suite' was also a small, unfurnished and pretty useless room at the side.

Other details also irritated.   A lack of storage space in the bedroom, just a small wardrobe and two small drawers with lots of other storage space blocked off.   In the bathroom, there was no towel rail near the shower and no light over the basin.   The air conditioning was noisy and difficult to control.

Having said that, the staff were good and friendly and the hotel generally is good.   I would be happy to come back here but wouldn't race back.",4,2013,09,10
206,"Just a few problems, otherwise almost perfect.","We found the staff very helpful and not in an intrusive way. The rooms were excellent and the WiFi service fast and efficient. There were just a couple of negatives which if sorted would make this the best hotel in Dublin that I have stayed at.

The breakfast buffet was poor with cold, rock hard potato bread and limited choice. They do have an a la carte option but there was just too few staff for the number of guests which made the service so slow that the potential for getting it before lunch time seemed very limited. We waited ages just for tea/coffee. There are a number of cafes/restaurants nearby which do provide better and cheaper alternatives.

The main bar totally lacks any atmosphere. It is a bit like being at the airport and the architecture is probably a bit ""way-out"" for some people. There is another bar across the square which is much more traditional in design and character so if you don't want to stray too far from the hotel, go there.

The roof-top bar at the minute is a bit of a gimmick. The suggestion that you might have to queue for it - don't bother. The enclosed area is just too small for the Irish climate which renders the other 80% defunct, probably for most of the year. And even by Dublin standards, this is no sky-scraper so there are quite a few taller buildings limiting the ""panoramic"" view of the city!

However, the service really did stand out, particularly the valet parking so make sure you book this in advance if you are driving.

I am going back in 3 weeks!",4,2013,09,09
206,A bitter sweet experience....,"This hotel is a bit of an enigma. On the one hand the architecture and the rooms are very very impressive but on the other the quality of service available to guests is certainly not 5 star. My wife and I stayed one night. On arrival in our room we discovered that the minibar had not been re-stocked. We then thought we would spend some time at the rooftop bar. We were told yes, we could go up but only for 45 minutes....nice one!! We then had an evening meal in the 'restaurant'....more like a cafe. It's right at the front door so there's a constant breeze coming in. I asked why they weren't using the part of the restaurant featured on their website and was told it was for 'overflow' only,even though it looked much more intimate. We then retired to the bar which again is right at the front entrance. Seating was very limited. I grabbed a couple of free high chairs and sat waiting for service. About 2 minutes later one of the bar staff approached me and said I couldn't use the stools 'because they were reserved for a couple of non-resident blokes who had popped out for a 10 minute fag'....charming. We stood around for a while and then retreated to the quietness of our room. Breakfast was a shambles. After a 10 minute wait we were eventually led to our table only to find that it had not been set. We waited 10 minutes to have that sorted. I checked out fully expecting to be asked how my stay was....nothing....the receptionist took my money and that was that.
To sum up, nice shiny new hotels can have the lovely spa and pool, lovely decor, plush carpet, nice rooms but it takes more than that to make it 5 star......there's a bit of work to be done at the Marker...enough said...",3,2013,09,08
206,Amazing Hotel,"Stayed here in June while attending the Robbie Williams concert. Check-in was efficient by a friendly receptionist. We were staying in a standard room but there was nothing standard about this room. The rooms are impressive. Modern, clean and of good size. Bathroom had walk-in shower and a deep bath. On leaving the hotel for the concert we were offered umbrellas by the doorman as it was raining. Breakfast is buffet style and of good quality. Highly recommend this hotel and next time I am in Dublin I will be booking this hotel",5,2013,09,08
206,Luxurious & Affordable,"My partner & I had flown back to Dublin at 1:30am and had a reservation in a different hotel in the city. A terrible 3 star hotel that charged 110 / night. The experience resulted in us trying to check-out no later than one hour of arriving at that dreadful place. I checked online at 2:30am to find an alternative hotel for us to stay in. Up popped the new modern 5 star hotel The Marker at an unbelievable rate of 130 / night. This wasn't the same right I checked 3 weeks previously, the price dropped by 60eu. I called the concierge of the Marker at 2:45am explaining the position we were in and immediately wanted a different hotel. He got a room prepped for us for a 6am arrival as we could not check-out of the previous hotel any earlier due to their incompetence. I think the guys name was Damian who helped us. we arranged for everything, breakfast and the room rate & paid over the phone. We told him we would be there at 6am sharp. Once we arrived everything was perfect, it is a beautifully modern new hotel. The service was something new, something I had only ever experienced in 5 star hotels abroad, but not in Ireland, so it was really great. We slept for most of the day & went out for lunch. I wanted to use the spa & pool but had no time, I only saw it. The rooftop bar was actually closed when we were there as it had only opened 4-5 weeks prior to our stay there. The only problem we encountered was our AC not working. Due to the inconvenience we were upgraded to a Deluxe room. The bathroom was much bigger with a separate shower and a slightly larger room.From the room service to the assistance from the concierge & night staff. This place was friendly & accommodating. Look for deals, it is worth it. I can't wait to return.",5,2013,09,05
206,The food here is great,"I haven't stayed here but go to the hotel restaurant for lunch a couple of times each month.  The food and service are excellent, some might find it a little quiet but I find that works quite well if you're chatting with people over lunch.  Great value for the quality of what you get too.",5,2013,09,05
206,New class hotel in dublin,"Very recently opened when I stayed and staff were making a big effort. Nicely decorated, good room, very good heath club and pool, a lovely evening when I stayed so I took advantage of the roof top bar with great views to the wicklow Hills",4,2013,09,05
206,"Clean, modern, helpful staff","Overall, the hotel and staff was very nice. The restaurants in the front are good. Good location. Just be careful if you are driving. The GPS has a tough time finding the building. Overall, good value. No complaints.",4,2013,09,04
206,Luxury in a Modern Hotel,"Checking in to this amazing hotel , the car was valet parked for us . The receptionist  was attentive and polite, the reception area was in a large foyer , themed in white , sculptured ceiling and all very modern. A door man offered to take our bags up to our room for us..
We were on the sixth floor , the carpet was soft and thick en route to the room. Room was amazing , decorated in dark furnishing , full length window with views over Dublin. The room had tea and coffee making facilities , mini bar , flat screen television, WIFI, bottle of water, toiletries, slippers and bath robes.
The hotel facilities included a spa , with a beautiful swimming pool, sauna, steam room and Jacuzzi. and a gym  , treatments can by booked. 
The bar was in the large foyer and served the best burgers I have ever eaten , with home made ketchup and the price was reasonable . All drinks were served with bar snacks of olives and peanuts in sweet little serving jars.
The highlight of our evening was the Roof top terrace where we could view Dublin at night time, we had to get a separate lift and were escorted up by a member of staff, greeted with a blanket , but the night was beautiful and not cold , we all had cocktails which were lovely.
Breakfast was a buffet style breakfast and we spent a good hour , munching through the vast .selection of delights , including a cross between a doughnut and a croissant , oh my goodness a delight to eat. Full Irish was also available as well as fresh fruit and a selection of yogurts and  cereals . The outside of the building is very modern , it only opened in April , but it fits in with the modern landscape of the Quays area of Dublin , I loved it there",5,2013,09,04
206,Amazing hotel!!!,"My husband and I travel a lot and I have stayed at a lot of fancy hotels and this is one of the nicer hotels I have ever stayed in. We got in very early from an over seas flight, this was not a problem at all. They checked us right in.  Everyone was super friendly and accommodating. The pool and jacuzzi room is super swanky and was amazing after a 6 hour flight. Our room was big and the bathroom was huge with a giant bath tub. It was very comfortable.  We also went up to the roof deck and enjoyed the outstanding views of Dublin.   The drinks and food are pricey as you would expect but delicious and worth the experience. Compared to what I saw other boutique hotels offered for in Dublin I can't imagine you will find a nicer hotel for the price.",5,2013,09,03
206,Wonderful stay in a modern hotel,"The Marker is a new modern hotel outside of the city center.  The hotel is impeccably decorated in modern d√©cor.  The rooms are new, clean, spacious and nicely appointed.  The spa area and pool were a nice retreat after a day of site seeing.  The roof deck has a wonderful view of the city.  We found it was easier to be accommodated on a week day as it is very busy on weekend nights.  We enjoyed the selection of appetizers and cocktails on the roof and in the lobby.  The hotel is a 10-12 Euro cab ride from City Center/Trinity College area.  It was very easy to catch a cab in both directions and it was possible to walk which was about 15-20 minutes.   The staff was helpful with suggestions and offered to make reservation and arrangements during our stay.  We enjoyed the cronuts and spent most mornings having coffee in the lobby before heading out for the day.  We would recommend the hotel and hope to return when in Dublin again.",5,2013,09,03
206,Possibly the best view in Dublin,"Stayed at the Marker for four nights prior to an international move and am happy to recommend this hotel. Rooms are light, clean  and comfortable. If I had to mention a fault in the accommodation it would be insufficient lighting in the bathroom. That said, both the shower and the bathtub are particularly nice and comfortable. Pool is a bit small, but has a really relaxing atmosphere. The staff at the Marker is helpful and friendly (particularly the bellmen) although I must mention the staff behind the front desk seem to be prone to misunderstandings. Nothing too serious but it shouldn't take 4 attempts to print the correct receipt and reserved taxi's should not be sent away without consulting the guest first. Staff at the front desk should also know that reservations for the bar on the roof terrace can be made and that in fact hotel guests are given priority. Which brings me to my favourite part of the hotel: the bar on the roof terrace with the best view of Dublin I have ever seen. On a clear day you can see well past Dublin Harbour and get a stunning view of the Dublin Mountains to boot. All in all, nice hotel with good amenities, very well suited for business travelers.",4,2013,09,03
206,A great experience,"Was really impressed by the Marker. Very chic and clean. Staff so lovely and attentive without being snooty or over the top. A great breakfast selection. Especially liked the Bloody Mary stand!
One criticism - rooms, hallways and lifts very hot and stuffy at times but otherwise great and would love to go back. ",4,2013,09,03
206,Wonderful Hotel,"We came to The Marker having left another Dublin hotel that was problematic for us (rooms clean but shabby, very noisy) and felt like we had arrived in paradise.  Everything about this new, exquisite hotel was top of the line, welcoming, friendly and exceeded all our expectations.  The breakfast was amazing (virgin mary bar anyone?).  We ate out on our travels around town for lunch and dinner.  The amenities, including a lap pool and jacuzzi, were a welcome feature, and the room were luxurious.  There is a roof top lounge area with awesome views of Dublin and a relaxing area to sip a beverage and meet with friends.  Our last night in town, the concierge got us tickets to see The Mouse Trap at the brand new performing arts center (a fabulous venue in it's own right) that was located, literally, just a few steps from the hotel's front door.
This was a wonderful way to wind up our three weeks in Europe and the UK.
Expensive?  Yes.
Worth it?  Oh, yes indeed!
Stay there again?  We wouldn't stay anywhere else.
Recommended?  Definitely!

206,Rather lovely!,"We've got some experience of decent hotels, having stayed in lots, including some of the One & Only and Four Seasons properties all over the world, but the staff at the Marker are some of the best we have encountered. They are efficient and charming without being obsequious - a special mention for Zoltan and Rebecca at Reception.....Rebecca remembered our names and took time out to take us up to see the views from the rooftop bar...she even took lots of photographs of our group and was exceptionally kind and patient with us...she is a gem! 
The food here is very good...we can recommend the baked camembert and burgers in the bar, but the antipasto platter was a bit grim (burnt baba ganoush, overseasoned hummus and the worst  olives - rock hard, flavourless and dyed an unnatural shade of green: the kind you find in cheap trattorias).
The facilities at the hotel are great with a fantastic spa and we particularly enjoyed the pool and jacuzzi which was superbly clean and well appointed (we loved the swimming costume spin driers!). We had a corner suite which was lovely and very spacious, although the air-con was tricky and we either spent the night in an airless sweat box or froze and woke up the next morning like freeze dried jerky! Housekeeping was fantastic and everything was exceptionally clean. Breakfast was great and service was again exceptional. The best things are the details here....every time we took our rental car out for the day, the valet had put bottles of mineral water in it for our trip....what a great hotel...we will be back!",5,2013,09,01
206,First time will not be the last,"Great location, terrific staff, clean large mod rooms and good gym...terrific experience will return again.  Dining was good as well at their restaurant, would do again...one thing the appetizers at the bar to order and complementary are not perfect....could be better.",5,2013,08,29
206,AMAZING,"Live in Dublin and recently had a new baby so choose The Marker as it isn't to far away from home.. Totally worth every penny amazing hotel, excellent service, very friendly and helpful staff. Roof top bar AMAZING especially on a clear night, pomegranate mojito a must!! ",5,2013,08,28
206,Love this place!!,"We stayed for 4 nights and really enjoyed every minute. The staff was excellent, the room was great, the amenities were good. Some others have complained about the about the lobby,the noise ,the food etc. I totally disagree.
The hotel is not trying to be old and stuffy. It seems it is trying to be W like, and it is meeting this standard for sure. 
The location is good as well, I really liked the space outside the hotel as well. 
I would recommend this hotel for sure to people who want a nice place to stay that is fun to be at. ",5,2013,08,27
206,"Great hotel, wonderful location","I booked in for 3 nights with my wife for a mini-break. Overall, I would strongly recommend this hotel. The staff were really helpful and friendly, the valet parking was really efficient and the hotel priced very reasonably for what you were getting. (One thing Dublin has done very well is making wi-fi freely available and to a high standard, pretty much everywhere. A major selling point!)

The room was spacious and comfortable. One gripe was the air conditioning was not very good, so on a warm night, not very comfortable. Underfloor heating in the bathroom was nice

Breakfast was good. The fruit did look a bit dry, but was ok. The butter looked like it had been left out for too long, but overall the range on offer and service were excellent. Room service, which we had a couple of night was of a very high standard, not sure why there was a tray charge, which I don't remember coming across before, nevertheless, the price was reasonable for the quality

Location was great. Near enough the city centre for a 20 minute walk or a cheap taxi ride, and there were also plenty of taxis. The hotel has a few nice bars and restaurants beside it and a nice supermarket a hundred yards away, where you can get a nice breakfast!

All in all great, but the air conditioning in the room was a slight drawback on the one warm night",4,2013,08,27
206,Excellent Staff,"Stayed here with my partner for a birthday celebration. The hotel is very modern and the rooms are excellent. We used the leisure facilities which were spotless and flawless. Breakfast was excellent and the waiter was very friendly.
We had booked the gourmet deal which included dinner for two however the night before we arrived I received a call to say that the Brasserie would not be open on the Sunday night and would we eat in the bar. This wasn't a problem and we enjoyed cocktails on the rooftop before heading to the bar. 
However when it became apparent that there was no proper dinner menu in the bar (more a snack menu) we were none too pleased. I spoke to reception and the lady behind the desk was quick to get the manager and start to resolve our issue. They reduced the room rate back to B&B immediately, called a restaurant in the city centre and got us a reservation as well as providing a complimentary taxi to take us there. 
We enjoyed a lovely meal at their recommended restaurant as well as a complimentary glass of champagne (they had thoughtfully called ahead to explain it was a birthday celebration)
When we arrived back to our room later in the evening there was a bottle of champagne waiting for us with the manager's apologies. 
Mistakes happen and that is unavoidable but what really stands out to me about the Marker hotel is the way in which the staff handled it so quickly and efficiently. They were excellent to deal with, apologetic and understanding. When we were checking out the manager (Maggie) appeared beside me again to make sure that we had enjoyed our meal etc and once again to apologise. 
The staff are truly a credit to this hotel and if you are in Dublin I would recommend having a look even if it is just for a cocktail on the rooftop.",5,2013,08,26
206,Cutting edge opulence in the city.,"Just had a one night stay at the end of a wedding and holiday and chose this hotel for its location and newness. Easy to find and parking directly underneath in a Q-Park.

Ultra modern styling that fits in well with the surrounding developments in a pretty waterside setting with lots of open spaces. Bright and cheerful reception area with seating and bars all around.

Checked in real quick after parking in one of the set down bays. Porter was straight out to assist and stayed with us until we were in our room and explained there was no rush to move the car.

Corridors are very dark with accent lighting at the doors to each room. The ceilings are very high and the room fronts set at an angle; so the atmosphere is quite futurisitc. Room was very spacious with top class amenities and very comfortable bed. Bathroom large and airy.

Went to the spa for a swim and found it quite empty. Serious swimmers would need to catch it like this otherwise I would guess it's only good for 4 at a time. Sauna and steam rooms are big and there is a huge skylight over the pool that keeps things bright, along with the pleasant decor, despite it being below ground.

Before heading for town we tried out the rooftop terrace. Had to wait just a few minutes as the capacity is controlled and soon we were ushered in to the direct elevator up to a wonderful vista on a bright and balmy evening. Lots of seating styles for groups and couples with very attentive service. Ordered a couple of wines and a few tapas. Quite surprised by the size of the tapas; really, really tasty and was enough for four. Had to walk that off so we could enjoy our dinner later.

A lot of great aspects about this place would make me come back again when on a trip to Dublin. The rooftop terrace is a real draw - even when it gets colder they have lots of heaters and the glass screens should see it accessible in to the colder months.",5,2013,08,26
206,Lovley hotel. not deserving of it's 5 stars - yet.,"Living relatively close to the area where this hotel is located, I was really keen to spend a night there to discover for myself what all of the hype was about. THe hotel itself doesn't come cheap - ‚Ç¨169 per night for a standard room.

On arrival, I was taken aback by the level of chaos that was present in the lobby. I've stayed in a few 5 star hotels and I have to say, I was let down by this experience. THe lobby itself is nice, but there was a queue of at least 15 people waiting to check in. This wasn't helped by the fact that the bar and restaurant is used by the general public visiting the theatre next door. Children running wild, annoyed people in a queue and staff that look stressed and tired do not make for a good first impression.

The rooms themselves are nice and well proportioned. Everything you will need is there, safe, ironing boards etc. Bathroom was large and clean.

Sleep quality was excellent, and the bed was exceptional.

The spa again again was really nice - but unfortuantely the pool and jacuzzi were full of kids, which doesn't lend to a relaxing environment. The pool area is very dangerous also. So slippy, and nothing to hold onto.

Eating and drinking was huge disappointment. To my surpise, the bar used by the general public is also the bar for residents. People leaving the theatre all flock here, and by the time we got there at 10.30, there wasn't even a seat. We decided to check out the roof top bar, but there was a sign up saying it was closed. When I asked a member of staff, I was told it closed at ten. By pure chance, I noticed some people getting into the lift and going up. I enquired again, and mentioned we were residents and at that point we were allowed up. While I appeciate they may be keeping this area for residents, there should at least be a sign up to let them know.

The hotel just seems disorganised. There is a huge lack of signage, the lifts takes ages to get where you want to go, staff are not well trained and the experience is simply not what you would expect.

Rooms are of a 5 star level - eating and drinking are not. Neither is the experience.

Checkout again was poor - what I would expect to get a 3 star.

I left feeling disappointed. THere is so much potenital for this hotel, it just feels like it's been rushed. No thought has been given to the niceities that make a 5 star hotel a 5star hotel.

However - with some work, it could be great.",3,2013,08,26
206,Brilliant wkd at the marker!!,"Had such a lovely stay at the marker this weekend. Loved the atmosphere and decor of the hotel and my room was so comfortable. The best thing about the marker though is the staff, they were all so friendly and professional and made me and my friends feel like VIPs. My booking was complicated with 16 in our group but the reception staff were so patient and remained so accommodating through out! Outstanding staff - best i have experienced in any hotel!!!",5,2013,08,25
206,Brand new and a delight,"This hotel just opened in April, so the whole place was brand-spanking new. After our teensy room in Paris, it was great to have an enormous room with all the amenities, including an adapter electrical outlet in the spacious desk, robes, slippers, turn-down service and so on. We booked on Expedia and so got a two-star rate on a five star hotel. Staff seemed still a bit wet behind the ears; very willing and courteous but not always knowledgeable. Ultra-modern design was fun. We went up to the roof top bar but bars aren't our scene and the intense security and hip ambience was a bit much, so we didn't stay. Ate once at the hotel restaurant which was very good.",5,2013,08,24
206,Don't be fooled...,"There is absolutely nothing at The Marker Hotel to warrant patronage by any discerning world traveller.  It may be able to fool the less knowledgeable but the real money should stay well away from this hotel at any cost.
Management is poor. Staff poorly trained. Restaurant, and bar cater to locals and not hotel guests.  Food is mediocre. Spa is booked by local ""members"" well before any guest has a chance.
At the prices charged here, one should feel they are getting 5 star treatment and The Marker fails to deliver at every turn.
If you are someone who knows what a 5 star hotel experience is then please, stay away from The Marker Hotel. It's all show and can't deliver real substance. I know because I've been there. I know because I've  been to comparable properties and actually had the experience I paid for.  It's really not very difficult to do. However, The Marker is going to charge you for an experience you will not have, that is to say that those who know won't have.  Those who don't know any better will gladly accept mediocrity unaware of the sublime experiences of true 5 star service available elsewhere in the city.  Pity.",2,2013,08,22
206,Simply magnificent!,"The staff at The Marker are outstanding,they go out of there way to make sure you are well cared for and the hotel itself is a jewel.  The rooms are extremely comfortable, the bedding is amazing,the bathrooms spacious and the phone chargers were a great touch.  The roof top bar is worth the trip the views are breath taking, I will recommend The Marker to all I know going to Dublin, an I can't wait to go back",5,2013,08,22
206,Very Modern Hotel,"My girlfriend booked this hotel as a suprise, during our trip to Ireland recently. The Hotel itself is based in (now) a very modern part of Dublin, down by the docks. When we pulled up in the car, the first thing I noticed was that everything in the area is very modern and very clean. Speaking to one of the locals, I believe the area has been under development for the last 2 years.

We were greeted immediately by one of the hotel staff, who kindly took our cases from the car and guided us to the reception desk to check in (parking is around 20 euro a night). The check in process itself was very easy and very quick. In addition, we were immediately provided with a map of the city and given directions of all the places to go. 

As we couldnt check in until 3pm, we immediately went into the centre of Dublin (Temple bar) to have a look around and grab some lunch. The walk itself is very simple, just follow the river all the way into town. It takes about 15 minutes to walk or 5 in a taxi. 

We returned to the hotel around 6 to check in. The room itself was like the rest of the hotel....very modern. Everything is decored in dark browns, blacks and greys. The room was very large as was the bathroom. Within 5 minutes of entering our room, our luggage was brought up to us.

We decided to have dinner in the hotel (the Brasserie). We ordered Oysters to start and the ribeye for main. Both dishes were superb, so hats off to the chef. In addition I have to say that our waitress was also fantastic. Not overbearing whatsoever and always on hand to help as and when required.

Following dinner we made our way to the bar for some evening drinks, chatted to the other guests, before heading to bed.

We ordered Breakfast in bed which was delicious and then headed to the spa for a swim. The Spa, like the hotel is very modern. The pool is about 10 meters long and decored in all black slate. There is also a steam room, sauna and plunge pool to accompany it. 

We checked out around 1pm (we asked for a late checkout which wasnt a problem). The car was brought to the front in around 10 minutes, our luggage was placed in the boot and we were ready to head to the airport. Again, everything was done very swiftly which was great. 

Overall, we had a great stay at the Marker and I would most certainly go back if I get the chance. It is expensive but a nice place to go to treat someone",5,2013,08,21
206,Nice Hotel,"We stayed here two nights before our tour of Ireland.  The staff were friendly and very helpful which makes such a difference to any hotel.  Customer service is the most important issue for us and is equally or more important than the room you stay in.

We would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Dublin.",4,2013,08,20
206,Roof Top Bar with Wonderful Views,"The chequered facade of The Marker Hotel dominates the skyline at Grand Canal Dock - in a good way. It's a fascinating, extremely modern, building. This modernity is carried through to the inside with its wide open spaces and vaulted ceiling. We had lunch in the bar and found the staff friendly and attentive. There were six in our party and we had a mixture of club sandwiches, burgers and the cod in beer batter. It was tasty, but nothing special. Prices are a little above average but only a little. Afterward we adjourned to the Roof Top Bar which is really special. The views over Dublin are wonderful. Cocktails are a little pricey but expertly made and went down a treat. We reckoned it was worth it for the service and setting. It began to rain and, although there was a covered area, it was too small to accommodate all those sitting outdoors  and they had to move into the bar. For those of us left sitting outside, the canopy (like a ship's sail) was too high and therefore we got slightly wet. A dark Dublin sky however is equally interesting and we soldiered on until it stopped! We had a great time at The Marker, it is 5 star treatment from the warm welcome at the door to hailing a taxi for us when we left. We'll be back!",5,2013,08,20
206,Lovely Hotel but not worth the money,"We stayed here Aug bank hol Sun and Mon night. My husband was running the Rock n Roll marathon so we received a discount, so decided to stay a second night as it was our anniversary, but we didn't realise we had to pay the full amount and go online and claim it back. The hotel carpark is hard to find, we parked in the wrong one so after check in we had to retreve the car (paying for the short time it was there),then our car was taken and parked(still don't know where as we didn't use it during or stay),plus parking in the hotel cost us ‚Ç¨60. The hotel does not accept Debit cards so we had to pay up front, plus an extra ‚Ç¨100 deposit, we were lucky we had brought enough cash. The hotel is lovely, every inch of it is spotless clean and very modern. It may be a matter of taste for some. The reception, restaurant, bar, cafe are all in one big area, very clean and airy, but kinda feels like your eating in the lobby, and I don't think there's any little cosy residents bar where you can sit up for a  few late drinks with friends. The rooms are lovely, clean, everything you need, but lacked storage, ""no drawers"". the bathroom is gorgeous, the air con is very quiet but not powerful enough for me, and windows do not open, so it was a bit stuffy. The beds are really comfortable and rooms are sound proofed so never heard a sound, which was great. All the lovely 5* touches, toiletries, turn down, chocs, little petite fours, ect...and the staff very very nice and attentive, although we were misinformed about the breakfast times, we were told 10.30am when actually the bank hol Mon was 11am but the Tue finished at 10am, we arrived around 10.10am and one of the staff was turning us away till I complained and the head waiter intervened and seated us, I felt this was a real cock up, we were looking forward to breakfast together Tue morn as my hubby could only eat something light on the Mon at 7am before he headed off to run the race. Breakfast was nice, but nothing special. We had a little peak at the roof top bar which is gorgeous, but never got a chance to have a drink there(pity).The pool and thermal suites area are ok, but nothing special and also allowed kids, nice for some, but I was there to relax. I imagine the spa area is nicer but I didn't have time for a treatment so can't comment. The area down by the Grand canal is all refurbished, lovely place to stroll and have lunch in a nice cafe, and very handy for the Bord Gais Theatre. On the Mon after the race, we took a taxi to temple bar, where there was a great buzz.. All in all the hotel is lovely and if you have a few bob, nice as a base to stay in Dublin, although it's a little of the beaten track ,it's a nice area.",4,2013,08,20
206,Wish there was a 6th star to give,"I cannot say enough about this hotel.  From the moment I walked in I knew this was pure luxury.  The hotel is very new, so everything is in perfect condition.  The building is very modern and absolutely gorgeous.  

We were travelling Europe, so especially comparing the room to London and Paris, it seemed gigantic.  The bed was SO comfortable.  A really nice touch was when they cleaned the room, and upon our return we saw beside the bed on both sides a little mat that said good night with a pair of slippers on them.  There were also two delicious chocolates on the bed for us.  It was also really cool on the TV in the room, they displayed your name, so it said ""Welcome Mr. (insert your last name here) to the Marker Hotel"".  A great little touch.  

The bathroom was incredible.  Huge shower with a great shower head and great pressure.  The bathrooms have heated floors which was so great to avoid the cold tile (it looked like marble, I'm not sure what it was).  They had a HUGE bath tub, which was such a treat.  We visited the Lush store in Dublin and got some bubble bath to enjoy it.  My husband is very tall so he rarely fits in the tubs - he had plenty of room to spare.  Heavenly!!!!

The staff were all very friendly to us at all times.  We sat in the bar a few times and enjoyed that.  The breakfast buffet was pretty good as far as buffets go.  Lots of hot and cold options.  The servers would bring your coffee and tea, as well as warm toast when you were seated.

The hotel is not in the core of the city, but it literally took us ten minutes to walk in (or a three  minute taxi ride).  I loved the location of it, out of the noisy parts of town so it was relaxing, but close enough that you could get to that part easily.  Loved the views, loved sitting and looking at the canal.  Dublin itself was also fantastic, we absolutely loved the whole visit.

We actually have some friends in Dublin, so were going to stay two nights at the hotel and then 3 nights at their house  The second we saw it, we knew we wanted to stay.  We told our friends we would just stay at the hotel the whole time and extended the stay!  They really couldn't blame us :)

Truly the best place we stayed on a four country trip to Europe.  I really have not one negative thing to say about it!  I highly recommend this hotel and will DEFINITELY return here on my next visit to Dublin.",5,2013,08,19
206,Perfect hotel for a treat!,Amazing! Stayed for one night & wish I could've stayed longer. this hotel has everything ! the rooftop terrace & the spa were both fab. Staff are all very friendly & seem to take pride in the hotel. cannot wait to go back!,5,2013,08,19
206,Great service,"Stayed here for 1 night for a wedding. The staff were very friendly (Unni/Robert/Ina) and v helpful with sorting out any wheelchair accessibility inquiries I had. Although check-in time isn't till 3pm, the location is gorgeous and the room was v spacious with an impressive mini-bar. We will definitely come back again.",4,2013,08,19
206,Greatest hotel in europe!,Great designing. Best service. We enjoyed our stay so much that we stayed more nights. Defenitly coming back! Highly highly recommended!! Best swimming pool. Very nice and quite location. Great view from the rooftop. Every little thing is great.,5,2013,08,17
206,"Nice hotel , grand.","Stayed for one night at The Marker. Checked in 3pm gave card for booking and was also asked to leave ‚Ç¨50 deposit? Strange I thought. For a five star to have to give ‚Ç¨50 over when checking in!!

Foyer of hotel is quite different. The bar lounge area is situated in open plan here and also the breakfast area. Very modern. Little cold at times.

We did not eat here for dinner but we had drinks after returning from a meal. We asked to go up to rooftop. We got our drinks so pricey ! Had our name on the list to go upstairs were told 10 minutes. 45 minutes later we got brought up to the rooftop and then got seated at a  squished table beside a squished couple in a section that had a roof and no views of the rooftop! So we had a look around and went back down. Lovely views but only some seats worth sitting at. 

Breakfast was lovely. But no direction from staff about breakfast options. Just kinda left to try figure it out ourselves. Only after realising could of had porridge, or eggs benedit etc. but had assumed buffet breakfast was the only option.

Nice hotel. We only had one night. But prices are unreal for drinks. An expensive treat. ",4,2013,08,17
206,Best pool ever?,"I hesitated to book the Marker as it is brand new and a bit of a schelp from downtown Dublin but these were non-issues. Dublin is small so you can walk or take a quick cab ride to downtown. And for a new hotel things ran very smoothly. The indoor infiity pool is gorgeous: perfect for swimming laps and the spa has top-notch service and facilities. As for the AC, if you like North American temperatures then make sure to leave your key card in the wall by the door with the fan turned up and temperature turned down at all times...it takes a while to get the temperature down. Coffee facilities in the room and a Norrrth American outlet. A few steps from the hotel are several excellent restaurants and cafes including our favorite, Herbstreet, and the Ferryman pub is around the corner.",5,2013,08,16
206,"Building as you would expect of a new build, but the Staff are what it's all about","This hotel is a lovely find in Dublin. The area is really nice for a walk. The new build is special and its well fitted out. The rooms are really nice but the Bathrooms are very poorly lit and in need of extra light even to see yourself in the mirror.
But the real gem here are the staff. There training has been very good and every one of them are proactive in looking after your every need and promoting the hotel. If that is the standard now they will be hard to beat in the future. Well worth the stay.
Ps the Cronuts are great",5,2013,08,16
206,"Cool, modern, friendly, etc etc etc...","It is really a very cool hotel in this arising hip and modern neighborhood of Dublin!

The views from the rooms, the atmosphere from their restaurant, the bar,  the swimming pool and gym facilities are cool cool cool!

I strongly recommend it if you are looking forward to discover a modern Dublin and to treat you during your stay in Ireland.

If you are looking for a center located hotel though, this is not the place to be. Yes, it is walking distance from the center but it's a 'little' walk of ten minutes which is not as 'short' as you wish after a couple of times. If you are looking for a traditional Irish place this is not the place either... 

Stay here if you enjoy being part of a trendy new and cool arising spot of town!

PS. Great food at breakfast and I have heard that their food for dinner is also very good.",5,2013,08,15
206,Fantastic hotel,"Fantastic hotel the staff couldn't be more helpful.the spa,pool and relaxation rooms were excellent.the roof top bar was amazing.the only let down was the price of the car park ‚Ç¨30 per day .....................................",5,2013,08,13
206,Very Trendy Hotel,"Stayed Monday and Tuesday last week, the room was awsome! The bed super comfy! the shower amazing! Breakfast was nice. I found the dinner menu very limited especially the starters... the steak dinner was nice was not gone on the pepper sauce though... the desert was epic and i had an non alcoholic strawberry and basil cooler that was to die for! We also tried the famous crounuts which were very tasty! I would love to stay here,",5,2013,08,13
206,Loved it,New designer hotel. Everything from start to finish was excellent. Only small comment is to expect fairly high bar prices. 9 euro 50 for a glass red wine. Having said that still very much worth it. Otherwise couldn't fault it.,5,2013,08,12
206,My first choice in Dublin,"I love staying at The Marker when I visit Dublin. The staff are attentive, the rooms are gorgeous and the location is fantastic for where I need to be. Room service is quick and accurate and just as good as eating in the bar or restaurant. Roof top bar is very cool although gaining access does often take a while however it's probably one of the few rooftop bars in Dublin therefore it draws a crowd. There's a great vibe in the bar at the end of the day. The gym is good and clean. I've yet to try the pool or spa! Give me time :)",5,2013,08,11
206,"Not quite right, yet!","Just stayed in the Marker for two nights as our normal hotel nearby was full.  This being a new and 'designer' hotel and having read about the rooftop bar we were curious to see what the newest addition to the hotel scene in Dublin was all about.  The setting is lovely on the waterfront of a fairly new development which incorporates a theatre, offices and apartments.  A lively area about a 10-15 minute walk from O'Connell Bridge, and a 20-25 min walk to Trinity College/Grafton Street.  Interesting Docklands and old Dublin sites around.  The hotel is modern, minimalist design: the ground floor is open plan with the bar and lift to rooftop at one end , the dining area (all meals are served here) at the other, the reception in the centre.  Barry, the doorman, helpful and friendly.  Other staff haven't quite got the hang of it yet despite being willing,  it has to be said that the black suits & wire earpieces are a bit off-putting, and their manner veered between forbidding (access to aforementioned rooftop for example) and hand-holding.  I did manage to go to the rooftop, by queueing to put my name down, and the hostess calling me on my mobile 10 mins later.  It is a comfortable area but not out of this world, and the view is good.  We had some tapas which were very inventive, tasty and about ‚Ç¨9 apiece.  A pleasant hour and a half later we left to join my husband who had dined with a colleague in the main restaurant.  I wanted to show him the rooftop but impossible to regain access even for a quick look-see, and I wasn't about to do the queueing thing all over again!  So: the rooms.  Access is by dark, 'mood-lit' corridors.  Good size room and marble bathroom with walk-in shower and big bath.  Faintly musty smell from drains.  Nice toiletries, good quality toilet tissue, thick fluffy towels, non-slip mats provided.  Magnifying mirror.  Separate hair dryer in wardrobe.  Lighting very gloomy and bad (what is it with hotel bathroom lighting, it's never adequate for either shaving or make-up).  Closet space only hanging, 1 very small drawer, bathrobes and slippers.  Bed large and comfy, good big pillows.  Plugs on one side only and not near enough to bed.  Lighting very bad, bedside lamp too far away to be able to read in bed, and main lighting also inadequate.  Good wifi, lots of TV stations.  Coffee/Tea maker and full minibar.  Food: Breakfast, juices, cereal was granola,muesli, all-bran and something else, ham&cheese, several kinds of good yogurt, good fruit options, homemade  breads, scrambled eggs (no fried or boiled) bacon tomato mushrooms.  Very pleasant staff.  Had lunch in bar which I thought was not so nice, nothing interesting, ended up with a just ok club sandwich .  Dinner was really good and the early-bird served until 19h is excellent value, fresh light cuisine with a continental twist.  Wine list good and reasonably priced.  Spa/gym/Pool: Pool, dark lighting, black tiles (slippery when wet), hot and muggy, jacuzzi.  Good range of equipment in gym.  Spa a bit functional looking, more like an upmarket sport centre.  Some fresh flowers and nicer soft furnishings maybe? Complimentary tea/coffee and fruit. Didn't have time to check out meeting/conference areas. Parking around the corner and no direct access to hotel.  Avail of the valet parking, it's cheaper and easier. So all in all not a five star experience.  There is nowhere to chill and relax with a book and a tea or coffee for example.  The bar area is smallish, busy, noisy and very public.  The rooftop could be a quiet haven during the day but the hyped queueing thing is a giant pain!  Will try again in a few months.",4,2013,08,11
206,Better than the rest,"I have never written a review for an Irish hotel before, mainly because I have never felt compelled to. However after a recent stay at The Marker Hotel Dublin I can safely say this is a new level of excellence here in Ireland. My husband booked a pamper package stay for myself and a friend of mine.
I don't know what I was expecting as there was not very much about it online as it has only recently opened, but I am happy to say I was blown away by the level of excellent service from all the staff we met. My friend is expecting a baby boy and was booked in for a pregnancy massage with them, after mentioning this in the phone to them we were delighted on arrival when we arrived to the room and there was a blue envelope waiting for her with a card congratulations your having a boy! ( impressive) little blue soothers and a beauty kit. 
I really was blown away by tge effort. 
We ate in the hotel restaurant and although the menu is slightly limited, and quite expensive for what it was, everything we ate was very good. The waiters were extremely friendly without being too intrusive and gave the place a special atmosphere.
Breakfast was better than dinner and was excellent. Very wide range of choice and plenty of smiling staff around.
My friend said her massage was wonderful and that there were relaxation rooms before and after and she was treated to sorbet.
The pool although a little chilly was in very stylish surroundings and the jacuzzi was spacious and not too hot which made it very comfortable.
From the moment we arrived until they had placed our luggage in the taxi and waved us off we were impressed by the 5star atmosphere they have created. By the interior and decor? Shire, but definitely by the staff! Well done team. Can't recommend highly enough.",5,2013,08,11
206,Expected better service,"I booked a nights stay in your hotel to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  Check in was fine, room was fine as well.  Unfortunately our experience in dining in the Brassierie and attempting to access your Rooftop bar left alot to be desired.  The food in the restaurant was lovely but our waitress accidentially slipped my glass of wine - whilst she, along with my daughter and myself mopped up the spill there was no apology - and worse still no attempt to replenish the wine spilt!  
Following dinner we decided to have a drink in the bar and also check out how we could visit the Rooftop bar.  When we tried to access it we were told that due to a recent rain shower and the numbers of current visitors to the bar, we would need to leave a name and contact number and that ""Catherine"" would ring us when it was our turn.  This we did.  After sitting in the bar for about a hour, and half way through my second cocktail, I approached Catherine to ask how come others had gained access to the bar well ahead of us.  I witnessed at least two sets of couples and a group of four women arrive, inquire about access, and then within ten minutes in all these cases, gain access.  Catherine was not interested in telling me why we were left waiting while others jumped the queue - she fobbed me off with ""I was just about to ring you, you can go up now"".  
Breakfast was fine but unfortunately these incidents have not endeared me either visit The Marker again or recommend a visit to others.",2,2013,08,08
206,Great Rooftop Bar!,"Didn't stay in the hotel but visited the rooftop bar last week. They have a good selection of drinks, cocktails, wine etc and from next week they will be introducing small plates of food of tasting size portions...had a sneak preview of the menu which looks interesting and all plates priced between ‚Ç¨6 and ‚Ç¨8 so good value. Drink prices are what you would expect in a 5 star hotel. Staff were excellent, really helpful and enthusiastic and managed to ""create"" a table for us in a bar that was completely full! The views of Dublin, in particular the surrounding Grand Canal area, are good and you'll definitely need your camera up here!",5,2013,08,06
206,Fabulous new hotel,"Stayed for 1 night in July and this hotel is living up to all the hype. Whilst there are certainly some teething problems to overcome its obvious to see staff are working hard at making improvements and this hotel will certainly be one of the best in dublin. Rooms are large and well equipped, very comfortable beds. Food in the evening was excellent quality but the menu was limited in my personal taste. Breakfast was superb with excellent use of quality local products. The spa and pool are amazing. One of the nicest ive been to in recent times",5,2013,08,05
206,Fantastic,I have only good things to say about this hotel. The rooms were lovely and the beds were so comfortable. The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant. The could not do enough for us.The food was lovely. We had full use of the spa and pool on the day of check out. Also they told us that we could head into town shopping on the day of check out and leave our car at the hotel for no extra cost.  Honestly I can't fault anything,5,2013,08,05
206,Excellent overall,"The marker is a new 5 star hotel located in a new business district in Dublin city. The hotel presents a superb first impression - aesthetically it is stunning. 

Check in was professional ( with seriously polished American lady ) as was the valet parking ( small gripe - the valet attendants should know the messing with the guests seat settings is a cardinal sin!. This happened twice ) so overall a really strong welcome is provided. 

I didn't know much about the hotel prior to arriving so i didn't really have any expectations. My room was an exec king and it was in every respect perfect. It was exceptionally luxurious, spacious and very well designed. Lots of plug outlets for the regular travellers various devices, a large safe that can easily hold a laptop and a bathroom that now sets the benchmark for other hotels to match - plush marble, sunken bath and massive walk in shower. Wonderful products in the bathroom as well. The in room mini bar is stocked with really interesting artisan irish brand food and snacks - which is a nice touch. ( although it was not re-stocked everyday....i definitely would have polished off  again it all if it was! ). The hotel has the best SECURE in room wifi i have experienced which is free. Thank you for who ever thought to add this extra layer of security - its a first by recollection for in house wifi. Throughout the hotel there is also another free standard wifi which itself is probably better than most hotels. The in room ents system is the Power Play system. I dont think its great - ive used it in a few hotels now. Personally id just like TV and Pay Per view movies. I think its odd there is no in room movies on this platform.  The other options that power play provide are in my view not necessary and too complicated for most travellers. 

Facilities at the hotel are top drawer - the gym and pool are class leading IMHO. The pool is beautiful.  I didn't use the spa but had a look and it is serene. I ate on one night in the restaurant and had excellent oysters accompanied by good service. On two nights i entertained clients in the hotel bars - the roof top bar is worth a detour. It is simply incredible. But........the staff that run the access to the bar just don't fit with the hotel. I think they are security people but they are not polished and they feel clumsy and tbh a little tacky. I witnessed a couple of occasions where they were actually rude to hotel guests - but i think more out a lack of finesse in people skills than it being intended. The roof top bar has a limited capacity and is popular so there can be queues / wait lists etc but this is the same at the equivalent in London but the hotel needs to look at the way this is managed because its a glaring negative. 

A quick word on the location - it is in a visually impressive new quarter of dublin but it is definitely a taxi ride from the CBD ( grafton street area ) and the local area is a little strange so I would be careful about walking off the main routes. Its not unsafe per se - but there is a mix of big corporate names ( accenture etc ) / glass building and an element of unsavoury local characters. ( druggies / drunks ). It was very notable and hence I make the comment. 

Breakfast on each morning was great and again great to see interesting artisan Irish labels being preferred to the big named brands. I took note of the yogurt name - it was amazing.

My bill ended up being a bit of a whopper for the 4 days but this included client entertainment and drinks charges etc and I feel like I still got value. This hotel sets a new bar of luxe quality in Dublin and I look forward to returning...... which I will do soon.",5,2013,08,04
206,Five Star +,"We've just had a wonderful break in Dublin and our stay at The Marker was above expectations

Breakfast superb...the best butter in the world..Yogurts - WOW!

Superb Johnny Loco bikes available to borrow at no extra cost..brilliant..

ALL of the staff were friendly , helpful and efficient...

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",5,2013,08,03
206,Fantastic stay,Had 2 night stay and must say from arrival to departure service and attention were 2nd to none. Girls on reception offer a first class service and make you feel welcome right from the off. Rooms are very well furnished and beds offer a superb nights sleep. Bathroom and toiletries are top quality. Breakfast was charged extra but was extremely good value. Bar meals were priced well and were presented and tasted lovely. Good selection of beers and again attentive staff. Look forward to visiting The Marker again in the future.,5,2013,07,31
206,Yes - It is very very good indeed...,"I have just had a two night stay at The Marker, and I have to say it is defiantly 5 Star...My room (superior king) was very large and had all the things that you need as a traveler..Dressing gown, slippers, mini bar (half bottle of red 15e), ironing board, huge bath, separate walk in shower carafe for coffee, good TV.....I can go on and on. I did not use the pool, but did make use of the roof top bar, which is excellent. 

Breakfast - Very good - Burger in the bar (surly the international measurement of any hotel) was excellent! 

Now I notice that the management read the review here, so I am going to very picky...Why was there no bubble bath? And also, why no movie channels? Just two very small points.....",5,2013,07,31
206,Cocktails on the rooftop,"Myself & my friend visited The Marker on a very hot summer Friday afternoon. We were given the grand tour & I have to say this is a really nice hotel, it is a cool modern hotel just 5mins walk from the IFSC. The pool area is really nice, I would say one of the best in Dublin City Centre. We had a lovely lunch in the bar washed down by a glass of precesso. We than got a table up on the rooftop. Stepping out of the lift we felt like we were in the Mediterranean. It is really fab & the weather that day of course made it. We had a few cocktails. Every member of staff we came across were very helpful & friendly. We spoke to the manager & he told us the plan for winter on the rooftop, sounds lovely & cosy. You have to try the Cronuts also, yummy!",5,2013,07,30
206,A hotel second to none,"I have been working in the hotel industry over the past ten years which can make for a very harsh critic but I have to say I was wowed by this hotel from start to finish
The hotel itself is beautiful very different but this hotel has the most amazing staff!
From the time we arrived to the moment we left we could not fault anything!
The staff on reception, friendly, attentive, very professional with out being stuffy. No matter who was on reception they knew our names before we even said our room number, a huge deal when the hotel was packed. Great staff
The restaurant staff again amazing, treated my two year old like an old friend, fantastic, and he was comfortable, everyone acknowledged him and knew his name. The bar staffs attention to detail is unreal, I couldn't decide on a cocktail so they sent over the most experienced cocktail maker who asked me questions about my likes and came back with the most amazing drink, they really care if u enjoy yourself,
I really can not recommend this hotel enough, their attention to detail is second to none, food is amazing, hotel is amazing, staff are amazing, rooftop bar is amazing, rooms are beautiful, 
When we were leaving the concierge went to collect our car and when we got in there was two bottles of cold water waiting for us, now that's a touch when it was 30 degrees outside
Congratulations to the GM Charlie Shiels and the Director of Sales Roisin O'Sullivan on an amazing product and phenomenal staff, who are very much to the fore front of operations , fantastic",5,2013,07,30
206,End of trip treat,"We booked the hotel online and opted for a 'superior' room. On arrival we had help with our luggage and our car was taken away to the valet parking. We checked in and were helped to our room and shown round the room. It was beautiful - white marble bathroom, king sized bed, tea and coffee, mini bar, robes and so on. We went to the pool and spa which looked fabulous but the black stone tiles were extremely slippery and why the pool was so narrow and so dark is beyond me. Very poor choices. We ate in the restaurant the first night where everything was just perfect. The second night we ate in the bar. The service was very poor - slow and the food was not brilliant. Hard to believe it was the same place as the previous night.
There is a roof top terrace which is fabulous and has spectacular views across Dublin. Well worth going (if the weather is good) even if you have to wait for an hour to get in.",4,2013,07,29
206,Good But Overpriced,First impression was not great when we were told car park was full and we had to park in theatre car park who told us we needed to pre book! Rooms have everything but minimalistic as oppose to luxurious. Service very good. Food for dinner was excellent. Restaurant cold and open plan which is unattractive. Did not sleep due to noise from airvent in room which was not on. Breakfast had lovely produce but to charge extra for pancakes and eggs benedict is a rip off when you are already paying top dublin room rate. Reception did make amends for the air vent issue. Service and food very good but way overpriced even for Dublin!!,4,2013,07,29
206,"just superb,","I have never put a review on tripadvisor before, but I felt compelled to for the Marker Hotel, myself and my husband stayed there on sat night as a birthday treat fro my husband and as a hopefully end to some serious health issues, we decided to treat ourselves, Maggie the assistant desk manager, was second to none, she could not do enough for us, I had told her about my husbands illness and she just looked as visably ubset as we were, Ania on the reception was fantastic, after a hic up with our rooms it was swiftly dealt with and sorted out, our room was soo lovely, for the first time in a very long time myself and my husband had a full night stress and worry free sleep, we had a drink on the roof top bar, its amazing, its a pity we couldn't stay longer here, we will certainly be back, it goes to say and hotel under Charie Sheils wings will be nothing but excellent.",5,2013,07,29
206,Highly recommended,"We stayed here for 2 nights and from beginning to end we found staff friendly and helpful. Rooftop bar a must, although it helped being a resident gaining access at busy times. We liked the liveliness of staff and their individuality - a refreshing change from corporate hospitality. Spa was one of the nicest we'd visited, very very relaxing, with a beautiful pool. We'd definitely stay again. 

",5,2013,07,29
206,Hard to beat,"We stayed at Marker for 3 nights and can truly confess that this was one of the better experiences we have made so far. It seems as they have collected and applied all the best from different 5 star hotels in the world. Staff is extremy attentive & friendly ""they take care!"", food in brasserie was fabulous, the rooms are well equiped, spacious with a big bathroom and perfect light. The sound of the air conditioning is not as noisy as in many other hotels and finally we enjoyed one of the best massages in the spa, the therapist carefully listened to our needs and did a great massage with a lot of sensibility. Breakfast was special with nice yoghurt and great choice of fruits. Yes, we would come back again!!!",5,2013,07,28
206,FAB OVERNIGHT STAY AT MARKER,"The hotel is really modern, clean and fresh. We arrived at hotel  shortly after 11.00am and were met by a very friendy guy, who took us to reception and then parked our car. A great service in city, when parkiing  can be a nightmare.  When we made our way  to recption, the lasy behind desk had remembered me phoning to enquiy about parkiing, before check in time, so she had our room ready for us. This was great.  The rooms were lovely, with all modern gadgets, really comfortable and relaxing. We ate in bar and had a few cocktails. The food and drink especially the cocktails were 1st class. At three the roof top bars opened and as  a resident, there is no problem getting up to it. It is something really different and service is amaziing along with the views.  We went out for evening as we planned to attend the match in croke park. On return they had kept us a table in roof top bar as promised. On return to our room, slippers and choclates had been left for us. A other really nice touch.  Breakfast int the morning was lovely. Everything is really nicely presented and tasted good too. Unfortunely we did  not get a CRONUTS at breakfast as there was none left. By the time we finshed our breatfast, we did go to bar to buy some CRONUTS, but they were sold out. This was 10.00am, so they must go very quick.  This was disappointing as i had read about them online. I  was looking forward to trying them. Maybe next time.  I would love to return to the hotel and have planned to maybe book a show in bord gais and stay again.",5,2013,07,28
206,Most beautiful pool in the world,We had a wonderful eight day stay at The Marker.  The hotel staff was amazing.  They were always friendly and helpful.  The breakfasts were delicious and the dinners (three nights) were perfect.  The best feature of the hotel was the swimming pool.  It was an infinity pool and it was the most relaxing pool I have ever been in.  I looked forward to my daily swim and dream of returning so I can spend more time swimming!,5,2013,07,26
206,Wow,"What impressed me most about this hotel was the staff and their attention to the finest detail, my wife checked in while I was busy running after our 2 year old.

On returning to reception later that day Julia, the receptionist, addressed me by my name before I could tell her my room number, I hadn't spoken to her before that.

I was also very impressed with the roof top bar and the views of Dublin from it.

The food was very good and the room was both spacious and clean.

When we collected our car, there was 2 bottles of water waiting for us which to me was just the cherry on top.

I'll be back.",5,2013,07,24
206,"Fabulous place which is perfect for couples, girls and families!","A wonderful new chic hotel in new grand canal area. Pool area and gipym fantastic. Lovely rooms, beds bathrooms and a fantastic rooftop bar which made perfect by sunshine. It's got charismatic staff which all great hotels need. Plus when taking kids great play area outside and across road from bird gas theatre. Definitely going back.  Loved every moment",5,2013,07,22
206,It was worth waiting for,"This hotel was a long time in the building and completion due to the troubled economy in Ireland. We decided to spend a night there after an evening out with friends. On arrival the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Our car was valet parked  although this did cost an extra ‚Ç¨20, but that's not bad for overnight parking in the city centre. We were shown to our room and it certainly had the ""wow"" factor. Very modern but not too minimalist. Very high ceilings and extra high doors giving it a stately and airy feel. There were two beds each about 4 feet wide, I would have preferred one kingsize but didn't like to ask. (My fault) I found the air conditioning wasn't adequate for the unusually hot weather Dublin was getting and was advised to keep the dial down as low as it would go to keep the room relatively cool. Not sure how I would have coped a week later when the temperature hit 29C!! What we noticed was the good attention to detail in everything. The breakfast was excellent too. They had recently opened the Rooftop Bar and there was a lot of security checking who went up there which made you feel very special. We had been warned it might get busy up there so we tried to reserve a table but were told we couldn't reserve, however there was no problem getting in about 21.30. The view was great but the drinks were expensive. My husband used the sauna which he said was excellent. Would definitely like to stay there again.",5,2013,07,22
206,Great hotel,"The Marker is a lovely hotel, rooms are amazing, nice and big with the biggest bathroom iv ever seen in a hotel. location is great. Roof top terrace is fab for a drink, views overlooking the city. Breakfast was great and staff very helpful and friendly",5,2013,07,22
206,Ok,For the price I was a bit disappointed. Nice roof top bar but the price of drinks!! We had a cocktail at ‚Ç¨19! We booked it as it was close to the O2 where we were seeing a concert. Is within walking distance of town centre but it a wee trek. Hotel very clean and quiet. We went into our room and there was stuff lying there that was meant for another couple which was a bit awkward. Would probably try a different hotel if I went back but nice all the same ,4,2013,07,21
206,Kind people and looks great,"The Market is a new 5 star hotel for not too old people. The people working at the hotel are mostly in their 20s or early 30s and are very polite. Everybody takes their time to be very kind and helpful. To some of the staff it comes more natural, but they all do it with flair.
You either like the location or you don't. There is not too much to do in the location but everything is close in Dublin anyway.
The rooms are lovely and big. Great beds, enough space, big bathroom; all you need.
The breakfast is just good, fresh ingredients and waiters are trying to serve you quickly. If you would like to have some special eggs, you have to pay extra.
That might also be one of the negatives from the hotel: it is not cheap. For you to decide if you want to afford it.",5,2013,07,21
206,A new hotel,"My daughter & I stayed at The Marker, which had recently opened.  We parked our car in the ""set down"" area in front of the hotel & she went in to register.  The Concierge walked past her to where I was sitting & told me I had to move the car - I don't know how he didn't see that we were checking in.  We could not find the car park after driving around the block & decided to use valet parking.  We walked across the street to Ely's restaurant for drinks & a half hour later the car was still sitting there; it eventually was parked.  When we returned at 11:10 pm, we wanted to go up to the rooftop area but were told it had just closed.  We made a point of getting back to the hotel early enough the next day so we could go to the rooftop lounge area.  The Concierge at the elevator to the roof at first told us that there already were 120 people there & that we would have to wait.  Once we showed him our room key, we were immediately able to go up.  The view from the roof was amazing, service was good & it was a nice evening to look out over the city. During that night, our room became extremely hot & it seemed like the air conditioning was not working.  Staff brought us a fan, which helped cool the room down.  When we were checking out, we were not charged for the valet parking because of the AC malfunction.  Our big room had a view of the playground below us & some of the city, and the dark curtains kept the early sunlight out.  Overall, the hotel is quite nice & in a good area, staff were very helpful, the beds were comfy.",5,2013,07,20
206,Location isn't always everything,"This hotel is a little off the beaten track down in Grand Canal Dock. However, even though it is a bit of a schlep from the Marker to the City Centre, I intend to stay here again. The rooms are modern in style with large and comfortable beds.  However, the real diamonds in the crown are the bathrooms, which are both high-tech and palatial in style. The deep bath is designed for maximum relaxation. There is also a shower made in heaven.

I had an enjoyable meal in the restaurant on the first night of my stay. And the breakfasts, though pricy, are of the highest calibre,.Often in life it's worth spending a little more to secure perfection. But you do not necessarily have to take out a bank loan to stay here. The hotel often offers double deluxe rooms on its website at the competitive price of Euro 149 a night.

Sadly, I did not get a chance to check out the rooftop bar or the swimming pool during my visit to the Marker. Next time around, however, both venues will be firmly on my agenda.",5,2013,07,19
206,Elegance in heart of Dublin docks,"An amazing place to stay, a lastminute trip to Dublin, and whilst looking for a hotel The Marker came up, great location near the O2 and the docks area.

From the doorstaff to reception all the staff were wonderfully helpful, our room was absolutely superb, this hotel is so new! After being initially disappointed about not being able to get space on the roof, the staff made sure after our night out, that they would save us a place. The Rooftop is a must place to visit especially in the current sunshine and a great place to end or start a night and residents get priority.",5,2013,07,19
206,Fantastic to the nth degree!!,"I chose The Marker Hotel to treat my Wife to a weekend break in Dublin for her Birthday.  We both travel regularly on business, and have stayed in a number of four and five star hotels in both New York and London, as well as other destinations, and it is my absolute pleasure to say that the Marker is up there with the best of them ‚Äì I have never before experienced such wonderful customer service in any hotel in Dublin, or Ireland for that matter, and feel that the Marker is the first hotel to finally bring true world class service to our doorstep.  On our arrival at the Marker, and as soon as we opened the doors of our car, we were warmly greeted by concierge, who took our bags, escorted us to reception and introduced us to our receptionist, while also taking our car keys to park our car ‚Äì Finally a hotel that offers valet parking!  The check in process itself was executed very efficiently by a very pleasant, helpful and genuinely friendly receptionist who wished my Wife a very warm Happy Birthday, assuring her that the entire team at the Marker will be doing everything they can to make our stay a special one.  

The Bedroom itself was beautiful ‚Äì contemporary, modern and luxurious, and equipped with everything one could wish for, from a cafetier√® with ground coffee beans to multi-region electrical sockets/iphone docks.  On first entering our room, we noticed that the Marker‚Äôs Assistant Front Office Manager had left a hand-written birthday wish to my wife, from ‚Äúall the team at The Marker‚Äù, which was accompanied by some very delicious hand made chocolates. 

Having sampled the Rooftop Bar at the Marker, I can certainly say that it is a wonderful place to enjoy a cocktail or two in the summer sunshine.  Again, the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming, which made the experience what it was - thoroughly enjoyable! 

On return to our room late in the evening, we found that our bed had been turned down, slippers had been positioned at each side of our bed, and chocolates had been placed on our pillows ‚Äì Nice touch!

The breakfast buffet offers a full choice of cooked items, which includes Portabello Mushrooms, homemade potato cakes, sausage, bacon, egg, tomato, pudding ‚Äì All of which were of very good quality and were properly cooked, which is a rare thing.  Also on offer is an extensive selection of cold meats, cheeses, cereals, and organic yogurts, not including the separate breakfast menu that lists breakfast specialties such as 8oz. steak with eggs, and eggs benedict, which we had.  The hollandaise sauce was exactly as it should be, and the eggs were poached to perfection ‚Äì Delicious!

We spent two hours in the Marker Spa, which boasts a pool, steamroom, sauna, jacuzzi, and treatment/relaxation rooms.  The entire experience was wonderfully relaxing ‚Äì If we had had the time, we would have stayed for the day!  Everything from the freshly squeezed orange juice and choice of herbal teas available, to the luxurious showering facilities with complementary high quality gels and creams, made it a very pleasurable Sunday mornings pampering indeed.  After my Wife‚Äôs massage, we went and chilled out in the relaxation rooms, which are three rooms, side-by-side and sectioned off completely from the rest of the leisure centre to ensure complete silence within, and offer the guest the choice of relaxing on either Fatboy beanbags, Cacoon Cocoons, or full length loungers.  Difficult to describe how peaceful this area is, you have got to experience it to appreciate it!  While resting in this area, my Wife‚Äôs masseuse arrived in and presented her with a delicious post-massage vitamin drink with a homemade strawberry sorbet, and wished her a Happy Birthday!

I really do feel that each and every member of staff that we encountered during our stay at The Marker took their role as customer service representatives personally, and did indeed strive to make our stay absolutely perfect ‚Äì Which they certainly achieved.  For example, never before had I rang reception from my room at twelve at night and had the night porter apologize on answering, using my name, for his delay in answering the telephone, which had been ringing all of 10 seconds!

The Management of this hotel have clearly brought many customer services ideas home from the US and applied them to the running of The Marker, which certainly shows.  Such well-trained staff, coupled with such a high standard of customer care is what makes this Hotel so different. Yes, it‚Äôs architectural design, and contemporary furnishings are beautiful, but it is the warm, friendly, professional staff at The Marker that puts this place at the leading edge of Dublin Hotels.  

To Management and Staff at The Marker, and particularly to Joanne in reservations for organizing everything for us, and to Ania at Reception for being such a pleasure to deal with ‚Äì Thank you for a wonderful stay ‚Äì We will certainly be back soon!!",5,2013,07,19
206,fantastic,"Stayed here for one  night before a concert in the O2.
Hotel only opened in June 2013 but I hope they keep it up, great staff,  valet parking (chargeable) 
the roof top bar in the current heat wave was brilliant and guests get priority over non guests so show your room card when going up.
Room -  we had a corner suite overlooking the canal very nice view, room well appointed with flat screen TV, I phone type charging dock, free WiFi everywhere, large bed, hand made treats and water, personnel letter and greeting wrote in chocolate with the treats, turn down service with more chocs. great bathroom and large shower.

The hotel also has a pool and all the spa stuff but we had no time to use it.
Did not eat in the restaurant as they do not serve food on Sunday evenings but its only ‚Ç¨5.00 to Dublin centre.

Buffet breakfast was one of the best we have had.
We felt that nothing was too much trouble for the staff everyone was friendly and it was nice to hear the true Dub accent again in a hotel.",5,2013,07,19
206,Marker Bar and a quick preview of the Rooftop Terrace,"Visited this bar, pre show at the Point. Service was immediately excellent. Welcomed, seated and drinks in no time at all.
Menu was a bit limited but full of interesting items. All included bread, however was brought gluten free bread on request. The fresh bread was great and interesting, as usual. Its a pity the same cant be said for the gluten free items.
Food was a bit slow on delivery particularly on a 'pre show' schedule, but it was good and tasty. We had the platter of meats. Good variety and plenty for two.
On conclusion we took a quick view of the highly recommended Rooftop Bar which is now open Mondays and Tuesday as well and it definitely warrants a second visit. What a great idea and brave decision in typically rainy Ireland. Lets hope they have some arrangement for the winter as it would be a shame to close in the chillier seasons. Wraps, shawls and blankets, all Irish products would be good! Also, serving hot drinks. Not just tea and coffees, but toddies and the like. The views were spectacular on a hot summer evening and will be too on a crisp winter afternoon.
Go, check it out.",4,2013,07,17
206,The Emperor's New Clothes,"Remember the 80's? Canary Wharf? Yuppies anyone? Welcome to Grand Canal, Dublin. Welcome to the Marker Hotel, where your every wish is ignored, from having the temerity to ask for a decent room (and getting a dark room with a view - of a wall), to politely declining 'assistance' with our one case - and being basically frogmarched to the lifts...

For your information, I am reasonably intelligent and know how a television works and don't need a lecture on what a room is...

Nor do I need to be asked to wait to check for availability for a table to sit on your roof terrace to be fleeced for a drink...did we not fit the de rigeur?

I looked up from outside an saw one head sitting there, hardly crammed. Rumbled.

Your 5 star rating is really being 'economical' with the truth. It's not. It's basically an upmarket Premier Inn. It's also pretentious and robotic. Staff recite the script by rote, even repeating ""welcome to the Marker"" and apologising for doing so...

I understand it's a new hotel, these and other snags are teething issues, however the genuine,  giving a damn authenticity is not fake-able... but then again, who cares when there's another couple of hundred euro to be had eh?",3,2013,07,14
206,Comfy room with a good view.,"The rooms were great.  The d√©cor is modern.  The bathroom was nice, but water came out around the bottom of the shower which made the tiles slick in spots whenever you got out.  The beds were super comfy and I loved the dark curtains in the room because I had been having issues with the rooms in other places not being dark enough to promote sleep. Plus the rooms were quiet.  We did not eat any of our meals here, but walked around the neighborhood.  We did go to the rooftop bar which was amazing.  The cocktails were wonderful. I am not able to grade this hotel up to a five because I felt out of my element at times and which I attribute to the d√©cor and the water seeped from around the bottom of the shower..",4,2013,07,14
206,Lovely few days,"Just returned from a great few days in Dublin, staying at the Marker Hotel. Superb hotel, lots of attentive, helpful staff. Room was excellent with outstanding bathroom. As a lot of our time was spent in the centre of Dublin, it did involve a lot of walking to and from the tram, so the public transport link was not the strongest point. Lovely location by the water though. If had any criticism, the air con in the room could have been better (unusually extremely hot whilst we were there) as could the lighting in the bathroom at the mirrors. Top tip: take a taxi from the airport if flying in: the coach links do not go near enough and involves a long walk, and for two people, the difference in price is negligible.",5,2013,07,14
206,Amazing,Celebrated our wedding anniversary with a stay In this fabulous hotel. It is so central to everything from shopping to theatre bars and restaurants. . The food in the hotels restaurant was superb.  Amazing flavours. Service was friendly and efficient.The  rooftop bar takes your breath away. The rooms are beautiful.  The staff so friendly and make you feel special.  Really looking forward to returning.  ,5,2013,07,14
206,Bar manager is sound,"Had a lovely evening in the Marker but some difficulty getting the attention of the staff in the busy bar and the food service was intermittent. However, once we brought it to the attention of the bar manager he immediately and very professionally sorted it out and made sure everything went smoothly. Couldn't have been nicer. Given the great weather in Dublin, the rooftop bar was amazing and a special place to enjoy a few cocktails and watch out for celebs.",4,2013,07,11
206,"Wonderful location and value, service, etc.","I had the best night here.  Great helpful desk staff, from the two nice young  women.  Hotel manager tried his best to find me a seat outside and we couldn't so he bought me a beer.  Location is beautiful and hip, roof deck awesome. Food looked good as well although I ate somewhere else.   The doormen / valets do all they can to help make your stay.  Room was comfortable , great air flow and mattress/ pillows.  

Would definitely go back!  Keep it up",5,2013,07,11
206,Fantastic hotel,"Back from 3 nights in The Marker and what a great hotel. We managed to make the most of what the hotel has to offer during our time there. On our first evening we had a lovely meal in the brasserie. The staff in the brasserie were all very pleasant, made recommendations and it was good to see it reasonably busy for a midweek evening which made for a nice atmosphere. The hotel has a very contemporary design, the music playing throughout the brasserie/reception and bar area gives a good vibe. After our meal we enquired about a visit to the rooftop lounge.We had to wait only a minute to be taken up to the lounge and seated. The lounge was particularly lovely given the glorious weather we're been experiencing and really lovely to look out across Dublin at dusk. Closing at 11pm is a good move as anyone wanting a 'big night' out will have to go elsewhere.

Our room in the hotel was really nice, again, like the hotel, it's very modern. The bed was fantastic and the bathroom lovely too and stocked with some nice toiletries. Maybe a luggage rack would be good so as to not spoil the white leather bench that seems to be used for luggage at present.   Our room looked out onto a square area with a playground at the back of the hotel and it was so quiet and peaceful we both had 3 great nights sleeps. 

Each evening of our stay we made use of the spa facilities. A perfect chill out. The pool is fantastic, as is the jacuzzi. The jacuzzi is probably one of the bigger jacuzzi's I've seen in a hotel. There's also a sauna and steam room. We easily spent an hour in the spa each evening. The changing room area is kept well too and again has nice shower products to use after the spa experience.

The doorman on the hotel on two days of our stay was a very friendly guy, keen to see how we were enjoying our trip to Dublin and in particular if we were enjoying our stay at the hotel. 

The hotel's location is excellent for anyone wanting to be a little out of the city centre, it's located right beside the beautiful Bord Gais Energy Theatre but a walk into the main city centre would take roughly 15mins. 

Overall, the hotel was spotless and the servicing of the rooms was excellent, any staff we spoke with were all very welcoming and accommodating.  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this hotel and I don't think it will be long before it creeps into the top 10 hotels in Dublin.",5,2013,07,07
206,"The best hotel in Dublin, by far....","Recently stayed at The Marker for my second visit in two months.

The staff, the food, the spa, the internet services cannot be faulted.   Honestly, I will no longer stay in any other hotel in Dublin.

I would also highly recommend booking a meal as the food in this hotel is simply amazing!",5,2013,07,05
206,First class!,"From the moment we arrived until we checked out, we enjoyed exceptional service from friendly and dedicated staff. The room was spotlessly clean, spacial and the most comfortable nights sleep I have ever had away from home. The attention to detail is superb in all areas, especially the wonderful breakfast served to our room for an extra ‚Ç¨5.

The wellness area (included in the price) has a great ambiance with a nice pool, Jacuzzi, sauna and steam room. Fresh juice or herbal tea was there for us after our relaxation.

We did venture up to the rooftop bar but it was full (understandably), but even without a drink it was worth going up for.

It is a bit out of the way if you want to spend the night in the city centre, although its only a 10-15 walk along the quays. But we were made to feel special during our one night stay and for that the walk was well worth it.

We will definitely go back again!",5,2013,07,04
206,Amazing Rooftop Bar,"I am only writing a review of the rooftop bar at this hotel as I have not actually spent a night in the hotel.  Although all being well would love to stay soon!

We went in to the hotel on Saturday afternoon after a matinee performance in the Bord Gais theatre.  When we arrived we were told the wait to go to the rooftop bar would be about 30 minutes so we left our number and got a table downstairs to wait.  The bar was really busy and there was a great atmosphere about the place.  The staff were also very friendly.  Within about 15 minutes we got a call that we could make our way upstairs.

The views from the terrace are absolutely stunning.  You can literally see right across all of Dublin.  The vibe was great and our wine was lovely.  I'll definitely go back and bring friends when they are in Dublin!  From other reviews it sounds like the spa is also worth checking out so I have that on my list too!",5,2013,07,02
206,Awesome place,"June 2013

Breakfast is excellent although but be aware it is not included in the price of the room. You have a wide range of foods and juices! 

The rooftop bar is amazing! The view is breathtaking and the cocktails are pretty good. Only negative point, they wouldn't let us up there at first... They didn't think we were staying at the hotel. It actually happened again the next day, we were asked to show our keycards although we spent the previous night drinking cocktail on the roof and ate in the hotels' restaurant. 

Don't forget to visit the spa: sauna, hamman, jaccuzzi, pool... it's all there! 

The location is good, right by the docks. But to access the center (Trinity college) you have to walk for 20 minutes - a shuttle system would be great!",4,2013,07,02
206,Amazing hotel...top quality!!!,"Myself, my mum and sisters stayed here for one night! The hotel is absolutely beautiful, very modern, clean and the rooms are so stylish!! The spa and pool are lovely annd very relaxing!! The staff are very friendly and couldnt do more for us!! Very helpful and accommodating :) We are all going back in January and will for sure be staying here again!! Excellent customer service!! ",5,2013,07,01
206,Excellent location & stylish hotel,"Lovely location, helpful service and nice because the hotel is new but a little bit too expensive to be very good value for money. Disappointing that the roof terrace wasn't open yet as we really wanted to to up there and suspect it would have added to our stay. Good spa facilities.",4,2013,07,01
206,Hard to beat !,"Just home after a fantastic trip to dublin .. This hotel made our mini holiday . Lovely large bright rooms , fantastic food , would recommend Sunday lunch here or the fish & chips in the bar . Great breakfast, good quality & fresh ingredients used . Excellent leisure facilities with set times for children's use of  Pool . Can not commend the staff enough , they looked after us and our 3 young children so well during our stay , we didn't need to ask for anything , they were always a step ahead .. Roof top bar is not to be missed , great choice of craft beers & fantastic views , ",5,2013,07,01
206,Few teething problems!,"It's a really lovely hotel,central enough,about fifteen minute walk to city.
I don't think I would call it good value for money.
The air conditioning needs to be looked at,as room was stifling hot and muggy.
Major problem was the car park,wasnt connected to hotel and very awkward to get to and seriously expensive with no hotel rate making nearly as expensive as hotel! ",3,2013,07,01
206,Not bad but need to brush up a bit,Room was perfect lovely petit fores on arrival. Nice big bottle of water in room was a huge plus. Breakfast choice was good however hot food and toast were not at all hot on either of the 2 days I had breakfast also loose the breakfast flat mushrooms they dont work use button oterwise good buz around I enjoyed it but I.was working so not much timebfor fun ,4,2013,06,30
206,On the Mark,"The Marker Hotel was crisp, clean, and comfortable.  The room, laid out at an angle, was adequate size; especially by 'city' standards.  

The room had a comfy king size bed, a small table with two chairs by the window.  Opposite the bed was a long table with flat screen TV and an adjacent desk with chair.  Near the TV there was a power module that had receptacles for US, UK, and European plug styles.  There was a small pantry with tea, coffee, and snacks.  The closet contained an iron, hair dryer, robes, umbrella, and safe.  

The restroom was clad in white marble and contained a soaking tub as well as a separate shower.  The bathroom floor was heated as well.  Adjacent to the modern looking sink was a receptacle that accommodated 125V (USA) and 230V power for shavers.  The only draw back to the bathroom is they shower and tub contained a rolled up bath mat that was not up to the standard of the rest of the hotels finishes.  (They seemed like something purchased after the fact at a local discount warehouse.) 

We also visited the pool and sauna which were very modern and clean.  The amenity floor also contained a hot tub, fitness center, and spa.  The only drawback  to this was these facilities were only open from 7 AM to 9 PM.  Those hours are ""OK"" but seeing as the sun does not set in the summer until around 10 PM, the closing time seems early.  Also, since this hotel will likely be catering to clientele in the adjacent office buildings, 7 AM is not good for a morning workout.  (Maybe this will change after the hotel has been open for a while.)",5,2013,06,28
206,Coolest place in Dublin,"Myself and my fiance had a fantastic time at the super-cool rooftop bar in the Marker Hotel this evening. We would recommend it to anyone seeking a unique experience and the best view over the rooftops of Dublln ranging from the bay to the mountains and Croke Park to the Aviva. Spectacular views and great service from Paul and all the staff. Also had great bar food downstairs. If you are in Dublin and want to impress and have a really enjoyable time, give it a try. /we loved it and will be back.",5,2013,06,28
206,excellent stay!,only stayed in this hotel for one night as we were going to a concert in the Aviva stadium which was only a 20min walk! would definitely stay here again the staff were very helpful and friendly. we had to wait an hour to get to the rooftop terrace as they only let so many people up at a time so i would recommend booking this in advance if you can. Also the breakfast was lovely. kaz and stef xxx,5,2013,06,27
206,Left its Mark on me!,"Great hotel, friendly staff, pretty cool design... loved it.  
I thought the location would be too far out of the Center but actually it was only about a 20 minute walk or a short taxi ride.  It is also a few minutes walk away from a train station. 
The rooms are spacious, clean, comfortable and quiet.  It did get a little too warm, especially at night and unfortunately, we couldn't work the air-con.   In all fairness, we didn't ask anyone to look into it.  
Slightly disappointing that the roof top bar was closed especially as we had the most incredible weather.  
We didn't eat at the hotel so could not rate the breakfast or restaurant.  
The spa was a delightful way to end the day before getting ready to go out, there is a big pool, a jacuzzi, sauna and eucalyptus steam room.   We were lacking in time for treatments, unfortunately. 
I would definitely stay here again.  I only hope those lovely new and bouncy cream carpets in the hallways stay so clean.",5,2013,06,27
206,A great new hotel - a few teething problems but can see the potential,"I stayed here for 3 weeks on a work trip, and was thoroughly impressed. The service, friendly staff, cleanliness of the hotel were all top notch. The rooms were lovely - huge comfy beds and pillows, slippers, robes, TV (lots of Sky channels), wifi throughout the hotel, and the bathrooms with rain showers! The spa was also incredible - a decent size pool long enough (23m) to do proper lengths! There was also a sauna, eucalyptus steam room and jacuzzi - very nice to relax in after a long day!

Also tried the roof top bar - stunning views, with sofas, chairs and heaters on the roof, however it was raining when we were there so would be even better in the sun! (Drinks are very expensive up here though.)

There were a couple of things throughout my stay - like I asked them to hold a bag of sushi in the fridge overnight and by the morning they couldn't find it. This was frustrating, however they offered me complimentary room service dinner as compensation (costing about ‚Ç¨40 - a lot more than the sushi!).

The second thing was one night the lights in my room didn't work so at 1am when I realised this (after a night out) I was informed Iwould have to move rooms for the rest of my stay. this was also a bit annoying, however they upgraded me to a Super King deluxe room, offered to help me move my belongings and then gave me complimentary room service breakfast.

So even though there were a couple of problems, the staff dealt with them far and beyond what was necessary, and this more than made up for it. They always dealt with things with a smile and did their best to keep people happy.

If it was raining, I would be offered an umbrella on my way out - and after having stayed there a few ngihts, staff started to know my name and would always ask me how my meal was, or how my day was. It was the little things like this - as well as the manager making a point of coming to see me to make sure everything was ok with my visit, that made the difference between here and other hotels.

A really great hotel to stay - perfect location for the Convention Centre/ Bord Gais Theatre, and the food is delicious, great breakfast, friendly helpful staff and luxury rooms and spa!",5,2013,06,26
206,"A"" Marker "" for other hotels","Stayed for one night (Sat 23/06/13) with my daughter, on our way to the Josh Groban concert at the O2..just a short walk away
As its a new hotel, opened just in April..one would expect it to be spotless clean ..AND YES IT WAS.
What made it special for us was the exceptionally friendly and helpful staff ,valet parking and 5 star room ( + the slippers and chocolates ).  Parking was a bit steep at ‚Ç¨20 for overnight,but that is the only minus we could find
On the morning of our departure, the ""Gentleman"" who brought our car to the door .handed us 2 bottles of complimentary water for our journey back to Cork ( Nice touch Lads )
Only just discovered that that the Hotel is under the very capable hands Of Charlie Shield..who provided an exceptional level of service when he was in the Clarion here in Cork for many years...Up Cork Charlie ..show the Dubs how its done.Marian",5,2013,06,25
206,a new  hotel,"stayed there for a quick weekend trip while in Europe.  Wonderful hotel, great staff, rooms, location and bars.   A quick walk and your right in the middle of all the local  pubs and live music.  Across the ""green"" is the Dublin Arts theater and science complex.  By the way, thank you Marker for a wonderful 2 floor Spa.  And unlike much of Dublin- the rooms were absolutely silent at night.",5,2013,06,25
206,Absolutely Brilliant,"We just stayed for a Saturday night at the marker, I was a little worried as its not really rated on trip advisor but this is because its only recently opened. If you like modern / chic decor, a friendly atmosphere with polite and helpful staff, spotlessly clean everywhere and stunning views from the rooftop bar and terrace then look no further, I can't rate this hotel highly enough and in my opinion it is now THE best hotel in Dublin. Drinks are a bit expensive but I guess you have to expect that in a 5 star hotel with views over Dublin that you will not find at any other hotel. Truly a fantastic experience and we will be returning. ",5,2013,06,24
206,Weekend Break,"Took an opportunity of a weekend spa deal at this new 5 star Dublin Hotel. Have to say left very impressed.  Good location near Grand Canal square in Dublin 2, 10 mins from town Centre. We know Dublin well as we live here !

Went for a Deluxe room with breakfast and 2 one hour spa treatments. The spa treatments are up there with the best we've had and we've had some pretty good ones around the world.
Definitely in our top 3 spa's. Our room was modern, quiet with great views and very well appointed. Didn't have dinner in the Brasserie, as we ate out , there's plenty of choice locally, but had the buffet breakfast and again this was excellent with loads of choice.  The Marker has a rooftop bar affording great views over Dublin, and will get busy on a nice summer night. The service was great, the staff were all very professional and attentive.  Absolutely no complaints and recommend. One nice touch on the bills is there no gratuity section , so its up to you if you want to tip, and with the service we got it was difficult not to. Highly recommended.",5,2013,06,24
206,Amazing view,"Overall I don't think the people at the Marker building the rooftop bar had really taken Irish weather into account - there is a small inside area and a huge outside area with a loose covering. Having said that, the view is stunning, the drinks are amazing and the staff couldn't be more helpful plus gorgeous blankets are offered it is chilly!",4,2013,06,24
206,"Needs more work for the 5 star rating, but is getting there.","Beautiful hotel rooms with very comfortable beds and a luxurious bathroom which, in my opinion was a 5 star standard.  The bar in the lobby is a bit clinical, but OK for a quick coffee or drink.  Breakfast was good, but not really 5 star standard, in fact, I wouldn't even give it a 4.  I didn't have dinner here so can't comment on that.

I am aware that the hotel is hoping for a 5 star grading and I think it is on its way to getting it, but overall, for the moment I would only see it as a very good 4 star hotel.  The staff are very courteous but I felt that they were under pressure to get everything just right.  I am aware that for the ""leading hotel of the World"" membership there are tick boxes that need to be met.  But, the staff seem to be too eager to check the boxes in the right order and that shows for the customer.  My name is difficult to pronounce, but the staff member gets it on 2nd pronunciation. The guy checking in beside me is asked his name 4 times.  After the second time he spells it, thinking that the staff is trying to find the reservation, but she tells him that she wants to know how to pronounce it. So after 2 more attempts she launches into the patter.....""hello Mr.  xxxx, and welcome to the Marker Hotel"", etc.

One member of staff that was relaxed and friendly was the doorman. Can't remember his name, (Conor??), but he didn't seem on edge, whereas the rest of the staff, while very courteous, seemed strained.  

We arrived for check-in at 4.30pm.  I'll grant you, it was a busy day due to the Robbie Williams conference (which I was attending). BUT, our room wasn't ready.  I have never had a room not ready at 4.30pm in the afternoon.  The lady at the desk suggested that we have a seat at the bar or go for a walk locally and she would ring my phone when the room was available. It was pouring rain out (as anyone attending the conference will vouch),  So we stayed at the bar. The drink is pricey, but then it is a top hotel. 

I didn't get to see or use the Spa and Fitness Centre or to view the roof garden.  Overall, I enjoyed my stay and I would recommend the hotel.",4,2013,06,22
206,Perfect in many ways...,"I stayed here alone for 3 nights after initially staying 3 nights closer to city centre.  My only complaint was location.  It was a bit far to walk to dinner where most of the restaurants were.  I like to be able to avoid taxis as much as possible when I travel but wouldn't have wanted to walk the stretch on Pearce street all alone...it's a bit sketchy in areas.  That said, the docklands vicinity is really developing and there are some new restaurants springing up!

room - I had a superior room, king bed.  It was perfect.  I mean perfect.  Incredible bathroom, spotlessly clean, lovely turn down service, minibar/fridge, coffee and tea...wildly comfy bed.  Great view of the canal and the mountains.

Restaurant and bar- quite  buzzy!  Lots of locals.  Wished I could have gotten to the roof terrace but alas, private parties on all my nights :(.  Excellent oysters and Guinness.  I say stick to the bar for eats..burger and club looked great.  Smoked salmon plate was excellent.  My dinner in the restaurant proper was underwhelming.  Very kind service though.  I didn't find the front desk very knowledgeable about the area.  I sourced out most of my meals from my own research, which is fine.

This is NOT an 'Irish' hotel, so don't expect that!  It's contemporary and perhaps to some, a bit cold feeling.  Frankly, that's ok with me. I'll take my authentic Irish at the pubs!  I love coming back to a deep soaker tub, high end linens and nice toiletries!  Just wish it were a bit closer to the action..can't have everything, I guess.

Some tips:  eat at Matt the Thresher for seafood, Paulies Pizza for Italian, take the dublin city bike tour and stop by Toners pub for a Guinness.  All good:)",5,2013,06,20
206,Fantastic location and a truly amazing hotel.,"We stayed here when we went to see Robbie Williams,and the whole weekend was just fantastic.We arrived on Friday afternoon to check in and the hotel was completely full of people and the atmosphere was electric.We were greeted with a warm welcome by the very friendly staff and we were brought to our room.The room was wonderful,bright,spacious and modern.We had dinner before we left for the concert and it was beautiful***** .We really enjoyed our stay and we will be back again and I have to say it was far from a ripoff for its location and status in Dublin city .",5,2013,06,20
206,Excellent hotel,"The marker hotel is a bit of luxury in d middle of the city, hotel roof top bar is fab, and rooms and facilities are excellent. Location beside bord Gais theatre is great with car parking on site, food is v good and service prompt, only downside of visit was checkout which was very slow ",5,2013,06,18
206,Beautiful Food and Excellent Service at the Brasserie!,"We recently made our first visit to the Marker Hotel and will defintely be back!. We went to the Hotel's restaurant for their pre-theatre menu before going to a performance in the Bord Gais Theatre.  Each course was first class and after our three courses we were pleasantly full without that real stuffed feeling!! We had a great table at the window with a view of the square. You are literally one minute walk to the Bord Gais Theatre! 
The service was excellent - in particular our waitress, Kristina.  She was extremely professional and well informed on all aspects of the menu (we asked plenty of questions!!)",5,2013,06,18
206,Amazing stay at contemporary hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for her birthday as we were going to the Bord Gais Theatre next door.

From our arrival right through to departure we could not fault the service and attention to detail. 
The rooftop lounge was lovely with excellent cocktails and great views across Dublin. The breakfast was amazing with everything you need and more. The room was very cosy and very peaceful with a huge bathroom with some lovely top end toiletries supplied. 
We didn't get to try the spa so we said we would definitely return to sample this in the future. All in all an amazing hotel with a fresh contemporary feel and great staff.",5,2013,06,17
206,Great hotel. Great location,"My husband stayed at the Marker for one night. It's a beautiful hotel. The staff are so pleasant and friendly.  The food in the brasserie was excellent. And the rooftop bar was amazing. The room was really nice with a great view   
The only complaint we had was that the toilet seat was broken. For such an expensive hotel this was unacceptable and should have been spotted by whoever cleaned the room before we arrived. Other than that we had a great time there and would return. ",5,2013,06,16
206,A bit of a disappointment,"Lovely Hotel but service is not up to its star rating.
The bar and bar staff were the worst I've ever seen.
They couldn't get a drinks order right, had to wait 20 mins to get drinks from the bar, an order for cocktails had to be returned as they were not done properly, a vodka tonic was served as gin and tonic.
Breakfast at the hotel was not included in the room and was ‚Ç¨15 per head for continental(way over priced)

Rooms were clean, quite and comfortable.
It's cheaper park your car next door at the Qpark than with the hotel.
Finally nice hotel with 2 star service.",3,2013,06,15
206,5 Star??,"First time ever writing a review for somewhere.....

Stayed marker bar the 8 June 2013, had problem with check in as i had parked in a car park that says  MARKER BAR car park which we pre-paid but it turned out we werent supposed park there and ended up having to pay for the short stay. Rooms are good but not what you would expect of a 5 star hotel.

the roof top bar though was amazing as it was a sunny weekend and the cocktail were savage although they ran out of ice and the bar service itself wasn't the best.

we had also paid for 2 breakfasts for the following morning and we had only received one which was a bit of disaster. so we didnt even bother eating it and just checked out when we had planned to have a bit of a relaxing morning in there pool which we didnt even bother using although on check out they refunded the price of one breakfast.

The only thing that saved us from having a bad weekend was the rooftop bar and cocktails, all in all i wouldnt stay again even for free.",1,2013,06,15
206,Stunning Hotel,"We stayed for 1 night at the Marker as we were going to see a show in the Bord Gais, perfect location for the theatre.  The hotel rooms are beautiful, black furniture, purple carpet and curtains and white walls, different but really nice.  I found all the hotel staff to be extreemly polite and friendly, at breakfast my son was offered hot chocolate by a really friendly waitress which i thought was a nice touch. We were refused entry to the roof top bar as my son is 11 and children are not allowed, which is understandable really for safety issues.
Overall a lovely hotel and I would stay  again but perhaps a little far from Dublin City Centre.",5,2013,06,12
206,Needs a few tweaks,"A friend and I stayed for one night in twin-bedded superior room which was spacious and very well appointed. The beds were each 4' and soooo comfortable. We found chocolates on our bed in the evening, plus slippers and fluffy bath robes are provided. The 'tweaks' needed were that no top lights worked [which made working out the air-con almost impossible, as no light and that part of room black wood], a slow-draining shower which resulted in water over floor, and a curtain we were unable to open in the morning. You are also informed that there is full directory about hotel and services on TV but no instructions how to locate it. Minor things, but unexpected in a 5* hotel. I also found the black dimly-lit corridors very disconcerting and the fact you couldn't open a window.

Overall, the decor of the hotel is very modern and smart, but I would think it would become shabby and dated sooner rather than later.

We had the pre-theatre dinner which was delicious and very reasonable. The wines by the glass were very good quality. Breakfast was excellent. There are also plenty of local bars and restaurants nearby.

We found the staff to be extremely helpful and friendly, but there is definitely an issue about leaving tables uncleared, both in the restaurant, bar and rooftop bar. It was also disconcerting to have to go through 'security' to go up to the rooftop bar, particularly as we are elderly 'girls' and hardly constitute a risk, I would think! 

I spoke to a manageress before leaving about the housekeeping issues, but no notes were taken.

However, we will definitely stay at The Marker again. Apart from anything else, it's proximity to Bord Gais is a winner. We also found it to be reasonably priced.",4,2013,06,12
206,"If you're looking for accommodating, friendly, helpful staff don't stay here!","Myself and my boyfriend stayed here shortly after it opened, thinking it would be at it's best. With the price and the ""5 star luxury"" advertisement we were expecting lots of helpful staff who weren't long in the job so would be willing to give great service, and also larger hotel rooms than in the city..boy were we mistaken! On the good: the rooms are clean and nicely decorated with big beds, flat screen TV's and marble bathrooms with underfloor heating. The location is excellent for the Bord Gais. And the breakfast was superb. On the bad: Our room was not ready to check in to for 3 hours after ""check in time""! And no apology was made for that fact. Waiting to check in we went to the bar for a drink, and on asking the bar man if there was a cocktail menu to look at, I was told in no uncertain terms to look around the tables for one! We are from the countryside in Ireland, so we were not aware there was a marathon on that weekend in the city, so after going to a show next door in the bord Gais we went for food just outside the city driving ourselves..only to find all routes back to the hotel were closed! So we could not make our way back to the marker for 3 hours! You would expect to be reminded of the marathon on your check in or at the very least before you ask the staff to bring your car out of parking for that evening. We did complain about this at 12pm when we finally arrived back to the hotel and the manager seemed extremely disinterested bordering on rude. The rooms are very small for the price, and we had no windows to open even though there are huge panes of glass! We are a young couple and we work hard to have nice weekends away in nice places, but I would not reccomend the marker based on its staff or level of service. I have stayed in better more reasonably priced 4 star hotels I would reccomend quicker. For the price there is bound to be better hotels with better staff in the city!",2,2013,06,11
206,Excellent hotel,"Nice, fresh and clean hotel with god service. Breakfast is tasty (15-19 euro for the buff√©) and rooms are perfect with clean carpets and nice bathrooms. The spa is really nice with saltwater pool for swinning, large jacuzzi, steam room and sauna, plus treatments. Location is good but it takes about 15-20 minutes to walk to center of dublin and temple bar. The airport transfer bus AirLink stops close by at the convention center right across the canal and is very easy to use. Hotel restaurant is good.",5,2013,06,09
206,Great hotel to be,"Spent 5d in the Marker for a nearby conference. Excellent hotel, great location, great staff. The breakfast buffet is outstanding, but one would expect that for 20 Euro's per person. 
The room was very comfortable, I had a great view of the docks, the bed is comfortable, the bathroom beautiful. However, it took some fiddling to sort out the room temperature and the heated bathroom floor. There was also a smell coming from the shower drain, hopefully that'll settle down over time. 
The rooftop bar was supposed to open the friday I was there, many ads all over the place, but when we joined the line-up, everyone was told it was closed (however a few selected people, with presents in hand were allowed in). Not sure what that was all about, just too bad it was so heavily advertised and then many people missed out. 
I'll recommend it to any one wanting to stay in Dublin, however it is more pricey compared to many others. Overall, a very good experience.",4,2013,06,09
206,Perfect bliss,"Just back from a three day girls weekend away in Dublin.  Stayed at this newly opened hotel.  LOVED It. The staff were pleasant, helpful,and courteous, allowing us early check in and late check out. The decor  is simple but stylish and relaxing.  The pool is perfect for those of us who like to always feel in our depth, a perfect temperature and beautiful environment. The food is absolutely wonderful. The rooftop bar  and on street seating make in the docklands area make this a most cosmopolitan hotel. We will definitely be going back.  It is only half hour from airport and also has the dart nearby allowing a trip,down the coast to be very accessible. 

The only draw back is the business of the  bar area meaning that often the rooftop bar is full although some priority is given to hotel guests.",5,2013,06,08
206,Lots of noise!!!,"If you want a good nights sleep I wouldn't stay here.  The hotel is lovely but there is a park right outside the hotel that draws groups of drunk kids all night long.  Again, would be a great place but if they want guests to be able to sleep they need to get the noise problem under control.",2,2013,06,05
206,Delighted we finally went!,"We spent Saturday and Sunday of our Bank Holiday Weekend in the Marker. Went in just for a ""quick drink"" and to check it out now the rooftop bar is open but the service was so good we stayed (for the afternoon both days!). Sat out on the terrace the first day and enjoyed some lovely wine in the sunshine. Lovely comfy furniture. Love the fact that even if you only order a glass of wine the bottle is brought to your table and poured there. It's those kind of little touches that make a difference. We went back on Sunday and ate there in the lobby bar. Food was delicious and very good value for what we got. Also a great kids menu so our 3 year old was happy! All in all every single member of staff was friendly, professional but not over the top with it and just a breath of fresh air for hotels nowadays. Dying to go back and experience the Rooftop Bar - we didn't have the patience to queue for it on Sunday with our little one but we'll be back soon. Might even treat ourselves to a romantic night away there soon a the rooms look amazing. Well done Marker.",5,2013,06,04
206,Excellent hotel,"Stayed here for one night as we were attending a show in The Bord Gais Theatre.  It is literally a 30 second walk from the theatre, perfect location.  The hotel is fab, very modern.  
The rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated.  We  got a complimentary upgrade as it was our anniversary and a beautiful medley of dessert awaited us on our arrival.  The reception staff were very friendly and helpful.  
The hotel also had some nice touches such as turn-down service and when our car was returned from the valet service, there were 2 complimentary bottles of water in it.
The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars and not 5 stars is because the rooftop bar (which we were looking forward to visiting) was closed for a private party.  It meant we had drinks in the reception area/bar instead, where the barmen were quite abrupt, not nearly as friendly as the receptionists etc
Overall an excellent hotel, perfect if attending the Theatre.",4,2013,06,02
206,New and off to a good start,"When I visited the hotal had been open 6 weeks.  The staff was helpful, but still getting use to the systems.  My room was very nice.  Good combination of style and function.  The work-out room was bright, well ventilated with good equipment.  Ideal location, just off a canal and an easy 10 min walk to the convention center. The breakfast that was included with the room was first rate with good quality and something for all tastes and cultures.  They are still working out the kinks, but all the staff seemed to be trying hard to make the stay enjoyable.  Overall a good experience and hope they continue to strive on the customer service.",4,2013,06,02
206,Modern contemporary but lacking something,"I stayed in a deluxe room which was very spacious, bright and modern.  The biggest feeling I had was that when in the bar or restaurant I felt like I wasn't a hotel guest.  I constantly wanted to know what was behind the bar, where was the centre of the hotel?  When would I feel like a guest rather than a visitor whom popped in for a quick coffee?  I felt like I was waiting on the precipice of something like when you are going to the airport but you haven't gone into duty free yet!!! But I never made it to duty free!!  Also the block of wood my steak arrived on was irritating my peas kept falling off and I wasn't allowed to have a plate when I asked for one.  I would return it was still a lovely hotel.  Patrons want the essentials from any hotel but I felt they were being a bit silly with the tableware and the presentation.",4,2013,06,01
206,New and getting there a great location,I visited for lunch with friends. On a sunny day the outdoor seating area is wonderful. The food was excellent the staff were good but we had to remind them on more than one occasion of our order but they made up for that by being pleasent. The decor is very modern and could do with a little softening. The reception area looks like an airport lounge and is impersonal. The lighting in the ladies toilets is very low so one would not be sure whether one's makeup etc was just right. I would certainly go back.,4,2013,05,30
206,Disappointing hotel,The hotel itself is quite modern and the staff are pleasant and helpful which is no more than one would expect from a 5 star hotel. However the level of efficiency of the staff both at administrative and hospitality levels leave a lot to be desired. There are two examples to demonstrate this. 1: My wife asked for a poached egg at breakfast which never came. We were not asked would we like more tea which would an essential part of training for the hospitality industry. 2: The room rate included breakfast but before we had time to finish our cereal the bill was presented. There was further checking before the receptionist realized that breakfast was included. All of these concerns were discussed with the receptionist before we left who duly noted them on a scrap of paper! If this hotel wishes to take its place with other 5 star hotels staff training at all levels needs attention. I was also quite intrigued (and skeptical) at the length and exceptional detail of the praise of this hotel in the other recent reviews.,3,2013,05,30
206,First class reception staff,"Have just recently returned from a night in the marker hotel and after reading so much about it I had extremely high expectations. The first impressions were very modern hotel and very new, however the service I recieved from the front of house staff and the reception staff was 5 stars. A young lady called Kornelia checked me in and I was very warmly welcomed by a very professional Front office manager by the name of Gary which added a lovely personal touch. We we attending a concert in the Grand Canal and the location was amazing as its literally a 20 second walk. The much antisipated  roof bar wasn't open at the time but this give me even more reason to return, breakfast on departure was very tasty and quick and the check out was as good as the check in. The 5 star service in this hotel is up there with the best around. I was informed that there were some slight details to be finish and I can't wait to see this place in its full glory.",5,2013,05,28
206,Fun for all the family,"We decided on the Marker hotel because we were bringing our daughter (aged 3) and her cousin (aged 8) to see the Lion King in the Bord Gais Theater. It was also one of the only hotels that could accommodate our requirements for a room with three beds (a king, a couch that converted to a bed, and another roll-away bed that they set up in the room). 

We were greeted warmly on arrival by the doorman who was jovial whenever we came across him. We had arrived quite early so our room wasn't ready. We decided to have lunch and it was very enjoyable experience. The staff were friendly and polite- a nice touch was when they dropped over complimentary shortbread biscuits for the kids. The price was also quite reasonable for a Dublin city centre 5 star hotel.

We had booked a corner suite  which was simply fantastic; a bright contemporary style with modern decor and floor to ceiling windows. It overlooked a small sand park and an old gasworks chimney stack.The bathroom had a separate bathtub and wet shower. It was quite dark in style...yet screamed luxury and sophistication, so I have to say it worked a treat.

The breakfast area is large and airy but lacks a bit of character and felt too business-like for our needs. The best thing about the breakfast was pancakes that we ordered for the kids (which unfortunately had to be paid for  separately, as it is not included in the bed and breakfast rate). The worst thing was the toast that was cold when it was delivered to our table.

A great thing about this hotel is the swimming pool. It is simply stunning and the kids were in heaven. We virtually had the place to ourselves other than a couple who were there for the first ten minutes of our 90 minute stay. There is also a steam room and sauna. The sauna didn't seem to be at the right temperature which was a disappointment.

The location of the hotel is perfect if you are going to a show in the Bord Gais theater as it is straight across from the main entrance. It isn't great when you want to stroll to the main shopping thoroughfares. The walk is about 15 minutes to O' Connell St. As a couple, this is OK, but unfortunately the weather in Dublin can be awful and such a walk is not easy with kids. 

Overall, we were very happy and the kids absolutely loved their stay.",5,2013,05,28
206,Excellent addition to Dublin,"The Marker Hotel is very close to our Dublin office but this was the first time I had visited since it opened.  First impressions are very good.  It is bright airy and gives a sense of affluence.  The lighting is subdued and the carpets soft (and very new of course).  My room was spacious, the bathroom even more so.  Facecloths were supplied as well as a toiletry kit gaining ticks in the box.  In the room was a table and a couple of easy chairs for relaxing but also ample desk space for working.  There were plenty of sockets to plug in laptops, charge phones etc.  Complimentary water was a nice touch but chocolates on the bed even better.  Breakfast is in the Brasserie in which there are a few tables right by the window offering pleasant views over the quay.  I've had better sausages and was disppointed to find only scrambled egg.  However, the next day I asked about fried eggs and it was brought to me.  So you only need to ask.  I liked the offering of portobello mushrooms.

All in all the competition will have to up their game now.",5,2013,05,28
206,Incredible hospitality,"My wife and I stayed one night at the Marker Hotel. From the time we arrived we were greeted with warm and genuine hospitality for every member of staff that we met. There is a real sense that the staff want you to genuinely enjoy your stay. There were a lot of nice touches. For example, when our car was driven up from the car park it has two bottles of water in the front seat for us. Check out was very efficient and helpful with our luggage.

The location of the hotel is superb, with lots of cafes and restaurants in the area and nice walks in the docklands area.

We will be back!!",5,2013,05,26
206,Great new 5 star hotel,"What a great hotel: the friendly staff, the location, the design (with great rooms). It's original and gives and leaves an unique impression. If the owner has made all decisions as it would be his/her own house. Loved my three days stay here a lot!",5,2013,05,26
206,We had such a great experience - the staff were just great,"I would like to thank the staff of the Marker Hotel for making our stay extra special.  We had our civil wedding ceremony that day and treated ourselves to a night at the Marker.  We were upgraded to a really lovely corner suite with great views of the canal area.  The room was comfortable, nicely decorated and spotless.  The staff could not have been nicer to us and helped make the whole day even more special for us.  Despite being a large hotel, the experience was very personal.  We will definitely be back!",5,2013,05,23
206,Easily 5 Stars!,"After spending one night in the Castle Hotel, (should be a hostel), we checked into The Marker. The marble bathroom with huge tub and separate shower stall, decadent! The buffet breakfast, fantastic. Location excellent.
Best hotel we have stayed in. 5 out of 5 in all categories. Highly recommended!",5,2013,05,23
206,A FIVE STAR hotel?!?!?,The staff is extremely rude and has no idea how to handle guest requests.  They wouldn't let us bring our Irish friends back to our room.  What kind of hotel keeps you from having guests.  Our friends were insulted and promised to never come back.,1,2013,05,20
206,Rooms lack atmosphere,"Stayed here for one night. Its a funky new hotel with very contemporary d√©cor which would not be to everyone's taste. The reception, bar and dining area are all open plan.
We did enjoy our stay here - the staff were very pleasant and the service was good.  Food was good without being memorable.
The bedrooms let the hotel down. Ours was sterile and lacking in atmosphere.  Curtains are basically white blackout lining. Rooms painted white which don't complement the Irish climate and felt cold. Carpet a rather impractical dark purple and showed every spec of fluff from the lovely new bathrobes.
All menus for both the spa and restaurant are supposed to be on the TV menu which was not the case during our visit. Would probably chose another hotel for my next stay but I do look forward to trying out the roof bar when it opens.",4,2013,05,20
206,Very Good,"Having booked tickets to the Lion King I decided to treat my parents to an overnight stay, this hotel is literally on the door step of the theatre. Our rooms were lovely, very spacious and with everything you needed. The bed was really comfortable. We had a drink in the bar followed by the pre-theatre dinner. The service was excellent and the food delicious, we were all really happy with our choice of food. When we came back from the show we fancied a night cap but the bar was crowded so my parents went straight to bed. Myself and my husband stayed for a drink and one of the waiters went out of his way to get us a table and chairs. The bar is very contemporary but I do think a lounge for residents would really make a huge difference. 

I had a swim the following morning before breakfast which I loved. It was so relaxing and the steam room was divine. My husband used the gym which he said was very good.

Breakfast was a buffet with lots of choice and it was very fresh. Again the food was lovely. 

All of the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. I would certainly go back.",4,2013,05,20
206,Very enjoyable stay,"I, my three daughters, my friend and her daughter had a one night stay bed and breakfast and dinner at the Marker hotel as we were going to The Lion King in Bord Gais theatre.  Very modern hotel with  professional, friendly and courteous staff. Special mention to Paul who took care of our luggage and Anna on reception.  We had one corner suite with a king bed and a fold up (very comfortable) bed and a double room with king bed and fold up bed - twin rooms were not available when we booked. Rooms were quiet with no noise from corridors.  Very happy with the rooms and bathrooms, although one of the bathrooms was finished in black marble and we thought the light in the bathroom was a bit dull but overall very pleased. Dinner and service was very good.  Good choice of menu for breakfast with attentive staff. Didn't actually use spa facilities but a very friendly member of  the spa staff showed us the facilities and the fabulous pool. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to sample the spa facilities/treatments but, hopefully, next time.  Would recommend this hotel.",4,2013,05,17
206,Trendy hotel close to Convention Center Dublin,"I've stayed 4 nights during a congress at this brand new hotel (opened 4 weeks ago). It's a nice, trendy place, big rooms and  bath room. No external noise in the rooms, central located and I would definitively come back.

One minor point : airconditioning needs to run whole night, as I can get hot in the rooms. Good breakfast en lunch capabilities.",4,2013,05,15
206,Amazing 2 night stay,"Just returned from 2 nights at The Marker. Fantastic modern hotel, rooms were spacious with a lovely modern bathroom. Tea/Coffee making facilities were more up market than other comparable hotels. Well worth checking out the infinity pool, jacuzzi and steam rooms. Couldn't fault the service, the staff were very accommodating and professional. The breakfast was very tasty and one of the best I've had with a good choice. The Marker is quite close to The 02 and a taxi is 10 euros but is walkable in around 20 mins. Overall a fantastic stay and am looking forward to my next concert at the 02 so can stay there again.",5,2013,05,14
206,Exceptional Experience,"What can I say...Spent 24 hours at the marker & it was amazing from start to finish.
Maybe not the most plush 5 star I have stayed in but the service was the best I have seen in a very long time.

Arrived and had prebooked valet parking - extreamly well worth it. Out immediately to take our luggage & car. We were upgraded free of charge. Check in very smooth. Room was lovely. Not overly big. very modern. Bathroom was amazing. 

The front of the hotel/bar/restaurant area is quite small. Bar food & Service excellent. 
The staff are just so effortlessly efficient & friendly. 

Very simple things like a smile - holding the lift door for you, have a quick chat with you.

The pool area is beautiful - the nicest in any Dublin hotel by far. 

Breakfast was lovely - I had read about there being an additional fees for pancakes, eggs benedict...ect, I think this is very poor for a five star indeed. The buffet is however great & we didnt order form the a la carte - purely because of the extra charge.

Breakfast service & staff were again amazing.

On a whole, I would deffinately return, were we just lucky to receive such good service ? I dont know, I seriously hope that the level is maintained as it really makes the hotel stand out.",5,2013,05,13
206,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed at the marker in may nice hotel fantastic Actually
Few problems though the lighting is not to my taste very very dark especially the corridors could put some female travellers off of they are on there own also the breakfast at 25 euros is just down right silly price I've stayed in lots of hotels as my buisness makes me travel a lot and this is expensive I didn't have breakfast so can't comment on it but a 25 euros I refuse to pay this for 5 euros of food ",5,2013,05,12
206,Modern and bright,"Decided on an overnight weekend stay at the Marker Hotel, on arrival the hotel was very easy to find and the staff were very helpful and friendly.  The room was spacious and very bright with fantastic views of the canal.  Location was good and an easy 10-15 walk to city centre.  The only negative was the shower in the room which didn't work properly, but this didn't spoil the visit.",5,2013,05,09
206,Good but not 5 star!,"My husband and I have just returned from a night in the Marker Hotel. It was our anniversary, so we decided to book a 5 star hotel to celebrate. 
The hotels location is excellent and there was a great buzz about the place, partly as it was a sunny bank holiday and partly because of the crowd going to the Lion King. 
On entering the hotel, we were a little dissapointed and felt it lacked the wow factor. Personally I am not a huge fan of minimalist decor preferring more opulent surroundings like the Merrion but really wanted to like this hotel for what it was. Overall the service was excellent but little things kept letting it down. 
We were upgraded to a delux room over looking the grand canal dock which was lovely but on entry thought it was more of a good 4 star room and not a 5 star. There was no mirror over the dressing table which made it awkward for drying your hair. They only left one small bottle of shampoo, body lotion and shower gel despite there being two people in the room and the mini bar was not fully stocked. It's the little things that make the difference! On the plus side, the bathroom was very spacious and the bed was very comfortable. 
We ate lunch on the terrace which was lovely and reasonably priced. Breakfast was a little dissapointing. Firstly it was a buffet, no problem with a cold buffet but at a 5 star level you expect to be served a hot breakfast. Also, there was no choice of eggs; only scrambled. The food was very tasty but again it felt more 4 star and not a memorable 5 star. The other thing that I found strange was that the tables were very small. We were seated a table for two and our breakfast plates barely fit on it. 
The bar was well priced and they had a very good wine list.
The spa was beautiful and the pool area was very relaxing. 
After reading this review you may feel that I am nit picking but it's the little things that make a 5 star memorable experience. We availed of the special opening offer which I believe was a fair price for what we got. I don't think I would pay the full room rate unless the wow factor was introduced and the small things were sorted out.

206,"Modern, elegant new five star hotel","We absolutely loved our stay at The Marker. Every member of stuff was truly friendly, attentive and service minded. All those lovely people were perhaps the main reason for making the whole stay so enjoyable.
The hotel is located off the main roads which makes it nice and quite at night. It is about 15-20 minutes walk to most of the tourist attractions. We discovered this really good restaurant, called Ely, just across the road.
Breakfast was fine. Oddly there were exactly the same things served every day. Again, the service was fantastic.

The things that we liked a bit less were the pillows ( too hard:)) and the oudour from the shower. However we didn't complained. 

Once again thanks to all the people working at the Marker for doing great job!",4,2013,05,06
206,Fantastic stay at The Marker hotel!,"Stayed for two nights on a weekend break. Location is excellent, 20 min stroll to city Center. The staff were so helpful and friendly from the front door to the room cleaners. Non alcoholic cocktails were great and bar staff very knowledgeable! The food it was superb, bearnaise sauce was delicious and the steak cooked to perfection. Bar food was equally impressive! I had a gorgeous treatment in the spa and the whole area is really relaxing. Rooms were spacious and immaculate. I love the marble bathrooms!! We'll definitely be back and look forward to seeing the roof top bar!!",5,2013,05,06
206,Excellent new hotel,Very nice spacious room.  Nice layout of bathroom.  Breakfast was good but would be good for complimentary omelette and pancakes etc. Internet was of a good speed.  Had issue with tv on first night and staff very helpful. Even left some chocolates next day to apologies. Also in a good location not far from CBD. ,5,2013,05,05
206,Great Hotel,"Husband and I stayed here for two nights, Friday and Saturday, at the end of April.  Took advantage of opening Special Offer upgrade to a deluxe room with view over the Square and Canal, all prettily lit up at night.  I had told Hotel in advance that it was a special celebration for us and this was acknowledged by Front of House Manager Gary on our arrival and a welcome tray of chocolates in our room.  Little touches but greatly appreciated. Hotel is only a month old and sparkles!  Room was great, floor to ceiling window with a couple of chairs from which to admire the view.  Huge, comfy bed.  Stunning bathroom with full size bath and separate walk in shower.  Turn down service each evening brought even more chocolate and slippers.  We used the Hotel's valet parking service, 20 euros per day, excellent service. Car always appeared within minutes of our request complete with two bottles of cold water each time - another welcome touch. Hotel bar was lively, maybe not surprisingly given it was the weekend and The Lion King was playing in the Gas Board Theatre, which is literally next door.  Bar Staff were friendly and attentive.  Cannot find anything to criticise - everywhere was spotless, staff were friendly - special thanks again to the lovely Gary for his genuine welcome and also to Barry for his all round helpfulness and particular expertise with our restaurant booking on the Saturday night. Would love to return, especially when the planned rooftop bar opens.",5,2013,05,04
206,Good for business.. and more,"A good solution for business travelers, very close to Convention Center and business district, but just 10-15 walking distance from Temple Bar...
Quite a good solution, good service, etc..
Food and breakfast were served properly",4,2013,05,04
206,Top Hotel with great service,"I stayed at the newly opened Marker Hotel whilst on Business in Dublin with a reasonable introductory rate. 
The hotel is very bright and modern and I could not fault the service we received. Despite being very tight on time I couldn't resist a dip in the beautiful infinity pool, it is rare to find such a tranquil and well decorated spa area whilst still being able to do some serious lengths in the pool.
We had a wonderful meal in the restaurant which was top class.
Would definitely return if I can negotiate a reasonable business rate!",5,2013,05,03
206,"Excellent Hotel, Excellent Location.","Really cool hotel. Rooms are big and ours looked out of the dock and theatre.
Bars were cool.
Breakfast was excellent.
Swimming pool area and relaxation rooms were the business.
Staff were extremely friendly and very helpful.
Will definitely return.",5,2013,05,03
206,"Beautiful Design Hotel, wonderful weekend stay","We knew about the building the Marker is located at for a few years now. Originally it should have been a Park Hyatt. The plans fell through, so we were excited when we heard it was finally opening as a hotel. It opened on the 2nd of April 2013.

The architect was Manuel Aires Matteus. The building looks unusual, because it is inspired by Irish landscapes, like the Giant's Causeway or the Cliffs of Moher.

The Marker is located at Grand Canal Dock, just opposite the Bord Gais Energy Theater, a short walk from the IFSC and the O2 Point Depot, another venue for concerts. 

We walked from the city center to the Marker. I guess it takes with brisk walking fifteen minutes. If you stroll, it's more likely to take twenty to twenty five minutes. My better half took photographs, so it took longer than that.

If you want to use public transport the 77a bus stops at nearby Pearse Street. The easiest way is probably to get in at the Central Bank on Dame Street. 

Otherwise taxis are also easily available.

There was still some building work going on and the already infamous Rooftop Lounge hadn't open yet. It should be ready by the beginning of May.

At the entrance we were warmly greeted by the doorman.  

The lobby is interesting because it is designed like a cave, but the windows - the whole front is glass - let in enough light, so it doesn't feel gloomy. Instead it's quite airy.

 The whole hotel is design driven and contemporary.

The reception is located a little bit to the left. If you go further down, you end up at the Brasserie or if you turn right after the entrance you are already at the Marker Bar.

We checked in on the fifth day of operation and had booked a Corner Suite for the price of a Deluxe Room. It was the opening rate.

The Marker has joined Leading Hotels of the World and since we are Leaders Club Members we played a little game. Would we be further upgraded or not?

Check in was smooth and efficient. It was a bit surprising, because we had been willing to give the hotel some leeway, since it was newly opened.

The receptionist was aware what Leaders Club Benefits we should receive and advised us about free internet, breakfast and a room upgrade.

A nice lady accompanied us to our Luxury Junior Suite and explained all the features.

Our suite was large and unusual shaped with a small hallway. The wardrobe was located there. It contained the safe and iron, ironing board. 

A small annoyance is the safe. It has been installed that the door opens up towards you, so it is in the way if you want to store items or remove them.

We had a small coffee table, a sofa, a chair, two benches, a writing desk and a huge bed. The Flat Screen TV has a system that allows you to read all about the hotel and its facilities. In case you don't like to use that, there is also a print out available on high quality paper. The same goes for in room dining. The TV channel selection was good. Only CNN was missing.

On the writing desk was a welcome letter by Charlie Shiel, the general manager.

The mini bar was discreetly hidden behind what looks like another cupboard or wardrobe. It can be easily overlooked, because it is very well integrated, and at first I thought it contained some security/electricity related stuff until my better half enlightened me.

On the small table were our welcome gifts - sweets from the kitchen (blondies, strawberries covered in chocolate - they looked they were wearing a suit - and chocolate mousse), a fruit basket with fruits we really love, a large bottle of still water and a newspaper. The plate containing the sweets was decorated with chocolate, reading ""Welcome to The Marker"" and a tree topped with a raspberry. It was a very nice touch.

The bathroom has under floor heating. It can be individually regulated like the air conditioning, and both worked well.

The bathroom was large with a sink, enough storage space for all of our cosmetic, luxurious Malin & Goetz amenities, shaving kit, full dental kit, toilet, scale, separate bath tub and large shower with a squared rain shower head. Material used was white and black marble.

The Color scheme in the bedroom was white, grey, yellow and lilac. 

There were also tea/coffee making facilities, and the mini bar contained some interesting local snacks and drinks.

The room was very comfortable and the views romantic over the Grand Canal Square.

The hotel has also a gym, spa with products used by Kersin Florian and indoor pool. This time around we didn't manage to use those facilities, but we went to the bar.

There was quite a buzz going on. It wasn't loud, just very full. We found a comfortable sofa and enjoyed people watching.
 
The waitress handed us menus and was soon back to take our order. We had a Drumbuie and a Kahlua, the House Terrine with sourdough bread and a side salad and two portions of the blondies. All was delicious. The service was prompt and attentive. The cost was a bit under 30 Euro (ca. 40 USD).

When we passed reception on our way back to the room, we asked for a late check out and requested a wake up call. The late check out was granted without quibble. 

We were also offered a newspaper. Unfortunately only the Irish Times was for free. We prefer the Irish Independent. There was an additional charge of 3 Euro. I hesitated a bit, because I didn't see why we should pay extra for this, if we could simply go home the next day and read the newspaper for free online. I consulted with my better half. Since he wished to have it, I agreed. 

We were about to make ourselves comfortable in the suite, when Housekeeping arrived for turn down.

I advised the two ladies they could go ahead. It took only a couple of minutes. We received two pieces of mint chocolate each.

Housekeeping also asked if I wanted the carpet hovered. It was spotless anyway, so it wasn't needed. I received an apology for disturbing me, but that wasn't necessary.

Later in the evening I requested more soap and bath gel. It arrived promptly and was again more than we expected. In fact there were two full sets of Malin & Goetz amenities. We already know the company from our stay at the Klaus K hotel in Helsinki and love them.

The Marker is the only hotel on the whole island, which offers Malin & Goetz.

We had room service later in the evening. We ordered hot chocolate, roast beef sandwich, salmon fillet and chocolate mousse. The gentleman from room service advised it would take around twenty five to thirty minutes. I was surprised when room service showed up after fifteen minutes. He told me they weren't very busy, so they could deliver earlier.

I soon realized why it had been so early. Somehow our order got mixed up. Instead of salmon fillet we received smoked salmon. It looked appetizing, but was still wrong, so with an apology the item was removed and the correct one freshly made. Another fifteen minutes later room service was back and brought the fish and a second pot of hot chocolate [ which was offered complimentary ] in case the other one was cold by now. 

We were also offered to replace the dessert, because the ice cream had melted. I didn't want another disturbance and wanted to enjoy dinner with my better half, so I did forgo it.

I wasn't too upset about the glitch. It had happened to us before that we received the wrong meals in hotels that had longer open than The Marker. As it was a cold sandwich, it didn't make a difference. The dinner came in at slightly under 49 Euro (ca. 64 USD).

The food quality was excellent and the dishes delicious. We enjoyed the views and a good conversation while having dinner. It was dark by now and the markers outside [ after which the hotel is named ] were lighted. There was also a colorful arrow directly showing to the hotel. 

We have been told we have been given the best room in the house [ beside the full suites ] and that it had been the show room before opening. Based on the beautiful views over the theatre and the Grand Canal Dock, it is easily to believe.

By the way the windows aren't made from mirror glass, so if you want privacy, close the curtains.
 
We had our five minutes in the spotlight earlier in the day. A lady had seen us, standing in our pajamas at the floor to ceiling windows. She waved at us, and I returned the favor. Her companion took a photograph of us. Which we found funny. [ and NO, we aren't celebrities ]

Before we could settle into bed, we had fun with the curtain. The suite had three windows. One was located in the corner of the building. The curtain was following the corner. We tried very hard to get it around the bend, but it wouldn't budge. We feared we were going to ruin it, so we called reception to send somebody up to close the curtain for us. If the request was odd, the receptionist wasn't showing it. 

The member of staff arrived within minutes. He had at first also issues getting it closed. We found out, when you go behind the curtain and pull at the handle it functions. Problem solved, we went happy to bed and slept through until the punctual wake up call.

I checked if there was any newspaper. There wasn't.

When we were ready to leave for breakfast an International Herald Tribune was waiting for us at the door step. There wasn't any charge for that. The member of staff has been receptive, and it was the right choice for us. It is in the details that makes the difference between a good and an excellent hotet, and this hotel is excellent.

The breakfast was served at the Brasserie. We were brought to our table by the host. It wasn't very busy, only a few other couples. We had a window seat. Soon our waiter arrived and took our order for hot beverages, juice and toast. The jam was already on the table. There is a buffet breakfast, including some hot items, like grilled tomatoes with mushrooms, scrambled eggs, bacon and so on, cold cuts, local cheese, artisanal yogurt, cut fruit and fruit salad as well as three juices and much more. The quality was excellent. There are also a la carte items available, some with a supplement charge, like French Toast (5 Euro / ca. 6.50 USD) or free of charge, like the Bircher Berner Muesli.

One of the heaters didn't close or only with great difficulty, but I hope this issue is solved by now.

The tables are on the smaller, but stylish side.

The staff was very attentive. Shortly before we left we received the bill. It only showed the 5 Euro for the French Toast my better half had ordered, so it was correct.

Unfortunately way too soon it was time to check out, which was quick and friendly.

I hope we can go back this year, other commitments allowing.

Would we recommend this hotel to a friend? YES!
Would we stay at this hotel again? YES!",5,2013,04,29
206,Faultless stay and meeting,"Stayed overnight during a company event after the hotel had only been open for a couple of weeks.
Have to say I (and my colleagues) were very happy with the facilities and the service.  The hotel is located in Grand Canal quay right opposite the Bord Gais Energy Theatre.  That means it's about a 15/20 minute walk from the city centre.  You can take the Luas to a stop on the opposite side of the Liffey leaving you a 5 minute walk.
The Lobby and bar is very open and bright looking out onto the Grand Canal Dock.  It might be a little modern/industrial for some.
Staff at checkin were helpful and knowledgeable.
The rooms are very nicely appointed - I always know it's a good hotel when there's a separate bath and shower.  You can't beat a walk in shower!
Room had all the good facilities you'd expect from a quality hotel - internet (good bandwidth). fridge/mini bar/Iron etc.
Breakfast was the only meal I had - it was very pleasant.
Our meeting for about 50 people went very smoothly barring a small issue with the projector but the staff were always on hand to assist.  They gave the impression being well trained and enthusiastic.
Hope they keep up the good standards.",5,2013,04,29
206,Fabulous New 5* Hotel - Lovely pool & enviable location on the docks,"Stayed here last night -  Brilliant Hotel & lovely friendly staff.
Even though the VIP Style Awards were on the staff treated everyone so well, very relaxed atmosphere in the bar.
The room was lovely very modern & funky - lovely view out over grand canal square.
Breakfast was really nice, very fresh & great variety - again staff faultless & friendly.
Pool is beautiful, its dark & relaxing and the jacuzzi was fantastic!
All in all this place is a fab hotel for Dublin I wont stay anywhere else.
It has every6thing the other Dublin 5 * Hotels have ... except the snobbery!!
In Summer it will be lovely to sit outside & walk around the docks or into the city (15-20 mins)
Rates at the moment are very reasonable maybe because its new .. hope they stay that way!
Keep up the good work guys I loved your genuinely friendly staff - I will be back! :-)",5,2013,04,27
206,Great new hotel.,"This hotel was so new the taxi driver at the airport hadn't heard of it. Good location for most business things. I was at the Convention Centre. Rooms a good size and well laid out. I didn't eat here but service on check in was prompt and friendly. Would stay here again, even for a weekend away. ",5,2013,04,27
206,Modern hotel with great staff,"This hotel has been open for just a few days so as you would expect the rooms and facilities are brand new and very modern. What is Impressive is the quality of staff, very polite and efficient. Food here is good with a good buffet breakfast. The hotel location has positives and negatives.it is situated in the old dock area close to a new theatre and a few bars and restaurants ( and U2's studios) and about 20 mins walk from the city. Taxi rank outside. I was here on business and would happily stay here again.",4,2013,04,25
206,Lovely brand new hotel,"Would love to stay here again! Nice brand new hotel, large stylish modern rooms, very friendly and helpfull staff. Pool looked lovely too...would definately recommend this place! Location was good..nice area...a long walk from town or a short taxi ride. There is a bar downstairs in the hotel and a few nice looking bars nearby.",5,2013,04,23
206,"modern, international","This hotel is wonderful new option in Dublin: interesting architecture and room design that is modern, thoughtful, and very comfortable.  Great gym and spa.  Good if not extraordinary food.  

Right now the hotel is so new that the service hasn't settled in, but everyone is extremely friendly and attentive.  

The big drawback for me is the location, but it's only a 7 minute taxi to the city center.  The other drawback, is that I love Dublin's classic Merrion hotel and am generally in the mood for a classic luxury experience when in Dublin.  This hotel is much nicer than most top business hotel, but it could be anywhere-- Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong, San Francisco.  Worth trying--I'll be curious to see what it's like a year or two from now.",4,2013,04,23
206,"Absolutely stunning, 5 stars.","Stayed for a night here and was blown away by the quality of the experience. Excellently finished hotel with a very contemporary feel and spacious, comfortable rooms. Bathroom had beautiful floor to ceiling marble and separate bath and shower. The customer service was exceptional - the staff were exceedingly friendly and keen to help. Breakfast was delicious; a wonderful array of fresh fruit served in the beautiful and bright dining room.

Took a morning swim in the pool, which again was beautifully designed and very tranquil. Extremely friendly and attentive health centre staff.

If you enjoy stylish and modern hotels with warm customer service and distinct design, you can't beat this place in Dublin.",5,2013,04,22
206,New and trendy,"Firstly, nice to see a new hotel opening and hope it does well.

Stayed 2 nights. Bedrooms are comfortable, good in room TV and make sure you find the somewhat hidden mini bar and coffee !

Staff were enthusiastic but seemed a little inexperienced, Had a few issues with check in, bar service etc. Not quite there yet for the 5 * experience. Hopefully it will 'improve with age'.

Bathrooms are great .

Bar area is very open. large but with suprisingly little seating. Breaksfast was as expected for a hotel of this type.Will be interesting to see how this one goes.",4,2013,04,21
206,"Great service, misleading website","Booked in for 1st year wedding anniversary, really looking forward to having a glass of bubbly or two on the stunning rooftop bar, especially given the lovely sunny weather.  Headed for the bar but found out it was still under construction, despite the photographs and commentary suggesting otherwise on the website.  Very disappointed, would not have booked this hotel had I known the true state of affairs.  They also don't stock prosecco, if you were hoping for that.  Despite this gripe the service is superb, rooms and beds very comfortable and breakfast top notch.  Valet parking very efficient.  Wish them well, should be the finished article in a few months.  More honesty would have left a better taste in my mouth.",4,2013,04,21
206,"Do yourself a favor, stay here","Fabulous staff, let us check in almost 8 hours early as we arrived exhausted and in need of rest and a shower! The hotel is brand new, but we found the staff to be very on top of things (hard to pull off at a hotel only in operation for 2 weeks). The rooms were very well appointed and stylishly decorated. The breakfast buffet was amazing and not unreasonably priced. Also, free in-room wifi! Cant recommend enough.",5,2013,04,21
206,5 STAR AT THE MARKER HOTEL,"Stayed at the Marker Hotel on Wednesday for an overnight business trip, arriving from London.  Hotel has been opened for a period two weeks there were not teething problems.  Julia and Ina the receptionist both delivered impeccable service.  Food was excellent, buffet breakfast really indulgent, have to say first hotel who cooked scrambled eggs just like I do at home butter and eggs, instead of stretching the volume with an excessive amount of milk.  Portering staff simply couldn't do enough for you.  The furnishings and surroundings were palatial.  Perfect, perfect. perfect.  5 Stars indeed!!",5,2013,04,19
206,Dinner at The Marker is a definite hit - we will be back for more !,"There is a lot to recommend dinner at The Marker, the restaurant is a large space but the acoustics are amazing and we could enjoy the atmosphere of a lively restaurant and still hear each other.  While we were dining a deux on a Saturday night I would certainly return with a larger group for business or a celebration as the food is very elegant, full of flavour and there are lots more dishes I would like try.  The scallop starter and beef carpaccio set the tone - both absolutely divine and very precise, the bearnaise served with my ribeye held an edge of flavour that can evade many kitchens.  The restaurant staff were fully attentive and the Manager was enthusiastic and gave great advice on the wine list - they seem a confident and comfortable team and we will back !",5,2013,04,15
206,"Trendy,cool and rooftop Bar.","I stayed in The new Marker Hotel during the week and just loved it. It is only open over a week and already there is a buzz that I haven't seen in a hotel in Years. The rooms are very classy and have an iPhone /iPad charger which is something most other hotels don't seem to know exists . You may wonder what's so good about that,well it just sums up the hotel. They are in touch with what's current and when the Rooftop bar opens in a few weeks I've no doubt that it will be one of the coolest bars in Dublin. Room for improvement with the directions to the hotel and there is an underground car park behind the hotel,but you can get you car parked for the night for ‚Ç¨20 if you want, by just parking outside the front door. The food is good but a little too expensive in this current climate ,‚Ç¨29 for the cheapest bottle of red!!!!, whoever came up with that must have been having a bad day, I'm sure it will be reviewed  and changed. Last thing,it's right beside the Bord Gais Theatre as a Marker, :-))",5,2013,04,13
206,Hard to say...,"5 star- really?
I'd have it down more as a 4 star.
That said, the hotel isnt quite yet 'finished', the rooftop bar etc will only open in May.
The bar in the lobby is a little like being in an airport hotel.. although service is excellent, most certainly efficient and 5 star feel to it.

There were a lot of conferences on there while we were there, which made it feel a little 4 star and 'chain' hotel like.

Location- great- plenty to do in that area and great facilities to hand.. walking distance to Grafton street and a lovely buzz in the area directly around the hotel.  Right next door to the Grand canal theatre if youre catching a show there.

I'll review again once the rooftop bar opens, but for now, i'd say 4 stars rather than 5- but best of luck to them, great to see new businesses opening in Dublin!",4,2013,04,12
206,Brand Spanking New ~ Great Location ~ Great Rooms,"Stayed here on the first weekend it opened. The location is pretty decent. It's not slap bang in the city centre, but there is lots going on in the area (Cafes/Bars/Restaurants), and only a short walk, about 15mins, from Grafton Street area. There was a small Hot Food Market in the square the weekend I stayed. (it seemed like a weekly event)

Staff were very welcoming. Maybe a little too eager but you can put that down to it being early days. The hotel is pretty spectacular and the rooms were top class. My room faced the square and was huge. Bed was very large and comfortable. It had everything I'd expect in a first rate room. Bathroom was large. Shower head was probably a bit of a let down, aesthetically, but thats about it,

Corridors to the rooms were a little odd. They are very dark (purposely) and occassionally lit up by spot lights.... We adapted but I dont think it will appeal to all travelers. 

We had a small enquiry for reception. We noticed a benefit on the website that should have come with the room, which reception were unaware of. We were told they'd get back to us but never did. We mentioned it at checkout and the staff was very apologetic, and compensated us accordingly. No big deal!!

My only gripe was the towels. All new and not washed enough. There was fluff everywhere. It was particualrly attracted to black trousers and facial stubble ~ not the best look ;)

Ate in the restaurant. Food was delicious. Waiters were great.
Drank in the bar. Atmosphere was great and staff were very attentive. The price of a pint was pretty standard (at the higher end of standard).

breakfast was Ok. It had a standard variety of foods - perhaps the cooked breakfast was a little dry....

Was looking forward to seeing the rooftop bar but its not opening until May. 

If you like the price, and the location, and love modern and clean, then I'd highly recommend it.
I really enjoyed my stay.",4,2013,04,11
206,Dublin's new Hot Spot,"Decided to try the new hotel on its first week being open and we were not disappointed.
It is located right beside the Bord Gais energy theatre.
From the moment we arrived the staff were so friendly, we even got talking to the manger and got a tour of their spa and pool area, which look amazing.
We had drinks in the bar to start, then we had dinner reservations in their new restaurant.
The food was amazing from start to finish and they have a very impressive wine menu.
The staff really make you feel welcome and cannot do enough for you.

I would recommend their cocktails, they are a little bit expensive but so worth it.
With the roof top bar due to open at the start of May this is going to be a great attraction, as the views are said to be spectacular.
I cant wait to go back, loved it.",5,2013,04,09
206,Marker Hotel and Bar,"Stayed at the hotel and had a really good time. Impeccable service and really good food. The bar is cool with a great selection of coctails, beers and wine. Our daughter loved the Virgin Mojito ! Great spa and really good pool. Once the hotel gets fully up and running with the roof terrace it will be a great spot.",5,2013,04,07
206,Good choice for Dublin,"Highlight the friendliness of the hotel staff, highlighting that of our Spanish waitress (she served us breakfast very fondly) and our Spanish receptionist.
Very well located hotel. The setting is modern and there is a theater in front. Well connected by tram.
The pool facilities are unguarded and we get some unpresentable/incidental. We went for a while and enough.
Breakfast is varied and has a menu.
Room on floor 5 was a junior suite although in a single environment.
The room was spacious and comfortable although the air conditioning must be left all day to not suffer heat.
The bathroom had some damage (door handle, exit water bath) but was spacious and the towels new.
A final brooch dazzled the room: we ordered taxi for airport and came a very dirty car, with stained upholstery... there were high-end taxis at the door.",4,2024,08,21
206,Go there.,"Pleasantly surprised in a very quiet neighborhood where you can walk in a completely renovated area
The excellent cuisine
Upon arrival I found courtesy and automatic upgrade without a specific request
Bravo
The only drawback (but it‚Äôs not their fault) to get out of the neighborhood, due to unintelligent traffic light system, was a feat",5,2024,08,02
206,Too bad.,"Lousy hotel, zero cleaning, three suites, curtains wouldn't close, in one room there was a leak above the bed that they never fixed. They only took pictures, the service much to be desired.  We asked for water; they never carried it, a lift never served then endless queues h standing on each floor",1,2024,07,25
206,Family visit in Dublin,"It has a good location and walking distance to the city center, quality facilities and staff who strive to give you good service. The breakfast buffets have a good variety and quality of food. It is the third time that I visit it, and its stay is recommended.",5,2024,06,14
206,"Rooms without fresh air through windows, the great feel-good factor is missing","Unfortunately, there are only rooms in the entire hotel where no windows can be opened. The room is decorated with a large ""window wall"" that is completely closed. A ventilation shaft in conjunction with an air conditioning system provides air supply. 
The hotel has to contend with staff who unfortunately do not live up to the standards of a leading hotel, even if they try very hard. 
The corridor to the rooms is noticeably not well ventilated. Impressive design in the hotel, but the great feel-good factor that you see on the Internet is definitely missing in this hotel. 
Peter, a manager who was responsible for the events, took great care of things and made everything possible for us. 
Unfortunately, when we left, two Lacoste shirts that we had just bought at the airport were missing, which was very sobering after researching and taking care of them. 
The hotel is very centrally located on a kind of island surrounded by water and is certainly doable for a short stay if you like a room without fresh air and do not value the Irish charm, which you can hardly feel in the hotel. The hotel restaurant's kitchen specializes in a few dishes, so you can't eat there every evening in a row. We, as a group who were there on business, noticed this on the second evening, so we didn't want to eat there a third day in a row.",2,2023,10,18
206,Preis Leistung stimmt nicht. vollzahlende Kinder d√ºrfen morgens nicht schwimmen,"Das Hotel ist mit 5 * aus unserer Sicht v√∂llig √ºberbewertet. Die Preise deshalb auch zu hoch. Die Sauberkeit insbesondere im Restaurant nicht ausreichend. Der Wellnessbereich stand unserem 12 j√§hrigen Sohn morgens zum Schwimmtraining nicht zur Verf√ºgung, obwohl er voll zahlen musste. Die Zimmer waren top. Sauberkeit der Zimmer ebenfalls. Das Servicepersonal in der Brasserie hat uns sitzen gelassen. Keine Frage nach weiteren W√ºnschen. Die Gedecke wurden erst nach mehrfacher Aufforderung abgedeckt. Das Essen war von der Qualit√§t mittelm√§√üig. Auch hier stimmt das Preis Leistungsverh√§ltnis leider nicht.
Schade. Sonst haben wir uns in Dublin sehr wohl gef√ºhlt und Dank der sehr guten Zimmer auch das Hotel genie√üen k√∂nnen.",2,2023,01,09
206,Perfect place to stay,"Wir f√ºhlten uns von Anfang an herzlich willkommen. Das Personal ist unglaublich freundlich und aufmerksam - so hatten wir das noch nirgends anders erlebt. Das alleine w√§re schon immer wieder ein Aufenthalt wert. Die Zimmer sind gro√üz√ºgig und modern eingerichtet. Der SPA-Bereich und die Dachterrasse sind ein Hingucker! Das einzigste, das f√ºr uns etwas schade war, dass wir mit unserem 11-j√§hrigen Sohn nur zu bestimmen Zeiten den Pool nutzen durften.",5,2022,09,14
206,Escapada,"La atenci√≥n del personal tanto en recepci√≥n, como el concerje y el servicio de habitaciones fue maravillosa! Mi habitaci√≥n fue una suite,mucho espacio, duchas y tina muy amplias. Las comas y almohadas comodisimas. Cafetera y t√© en la habitacion.La localizaci√≥n excelente fuimos a pie a hacer casi todas las visitas. Hay un teatro enorme al lado y tienen excelentes musicales.
Si piensan ir a cenar hagan la reserva desde el primer d√≠a para todas las noches, ya que los restaurantes est√°n muy llenos.
Si pod√©is hacer al menos la visita a los Moher Cliffts es preciosa y toma todo un d√≠a.
No te preocupes de llevar paraguas pues en el hotel hay unos maravillosos.
Tambi√©n tienen una terraza fant√°stica en los pisos altos.
En fin una maravilla! La gente en general es muy amable en todas partes. Volveremos sin duda.",5,2022,07,05
206,BUONE LE CAMERE E LA VISTA,"Un hotel moderno nella zona nuova di Dublino, ben frequentato e elegante. Camere ampie luminose ottimo bagno peccato per la zona di reception veramente non all‚Äôaltezza del resto dell‚Äôalbergo: sedie vecchia e demod√©, nessuna attenzione all‚Äôinterior design, davvero poco affine allo stile dell‚Äôalbergo.

206,Schlechteste Leading Hotel of the World Erfahrung,"Schlechteste Leading Hotel of the World Erfahrung. Gutes Businesshotel nahe Kongresszentrums. Das war es dann auch. Weit entfernt von einem Leading Hotel. Service m√§ssig. Zimmer modern, Betten gut. Leider laute, schlecht ged√§mmte T√ºren. Bad grossz√ºgig aber ohne Halterungen am Waschbecken. Housekeeping und Sauberkeit miserabel. Fr√ºhst√ºcksservice sehr langsam, wenig Auswahl besonders beim Obst, jeden Tag das gleiche Buffett. Pool sehr dunkel, das Spa wird auch von externen Besuchern genutzt. Keine freien Termin f√ºr Massagen f√ºr Hotelg√§ste mehrere Tage im voraus. Essen in der Brasserie gut, wenig Auswahl immer gleiche Karte.",3,2022,04,29
206,Tolles Hotel,"Das Hotel liegt in den ehemaligen Docklands von Dublin. Das Gebiet ist sehr stark aufgwertet worden durch zahlreiche Neubauten. Wie Wohnungen, B√ºros, Shops und Restaurants und Hotel. Nur zum City Centre nimmt man am besten ein Taxi. 
Ein tolles Hotel, sehr grosse Zimmer, auch das Badezimmer. Wir hatten unser Zimmer im 5. Stock in den Innenhof. Wir h√∂rten garnichts. 
Aufgrund von Corona, wurde kein Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet angeboten. Es wurde zwar eine Karte zur Auswahl gereicht, aber die war sehr rudiment√§r. Drei Arten von Fr√ºhst√ºck wurden angeboten. Aber genau da ist das Problem. Jemand m√∂chte lieber nur Brot und Marmelade und eventuell etwas K√§se oder Salami, Schinken etc.  Der andere bevorzugt dann eher R√ºhrei etc. Da h√§tte ich jetzt lieder einzel ausgew√§hlt, anstatt alles abzubestellen, weil man es vielleicht nicht mag oder was auch immer. Zudem liess der Service auch zu w√ºnschen √ºbrig. Nur Sandra (Chef de Service?) war sehr hilfsbereit und zuvorkommend. Es gab mehrere Serviceangestellte, aber oft wurde man ignoriert. Das selbe Bild hatten wir auch an der Hotelbar. 
Toll war, dass es auch einen Pool gab. Aber auch hier. Eingeschr√§nkter Zutritt, wir konnten nicht immer schwimmen gehen. Man musste immer vorher anrufen. Es ist mir klar, dass aufgrund von Corona es nicht immer einfach ist. Allen gerecht zu werden. Trotzdem, nicht ideal. Gleichzeitig haben auch Mitglieder Zutritt, die dann den Hotelpool als Trainingsort ben√ºtzen. Und nicht zu vergessen, es gab auch Physiotherapie. Das fanden wir als Hotelg√§ste nicht gerade berauschend.
Trotzdem w√ºrden wir dieses Hotel wieder ausw√§hlen. Es hat uns sehr gefallen.",5,2021,09,13
206,"Schoenes Hotel, schoene Lage","Modern eingerichtetes Hotel, schoene moderne Zimmer und tolle Lobby mit Barbereich. Sehr gutes Fruehstueck.

206,Ein top Hotel,Ich war nun bereits schon zum dritten Mal in diesem Hotel. Es ist sehr komfortabel eingerichtet und an einer sch√∂nen Lage. Die Zimmer sind aussergew√∂hnlich ruhig und sehr sauber.

Auf derselben Etage langer Indoor-Pool mit Dampfbad und Sauna, sauber/einladend.
Food war lecker, sei es in der Brasserie und in Foyer-Bar abends als auch zum Fruehstueck (einzig die Desserts in der Brasserie haben noch Potential)
Einziges B-moll fuer uns war die Lage, gut 20min zu Fuss vom Zentrum entfernt etwas weit weg, aber die Location ist gegeben und bekannt, also no blame.",5,2019,10,18

Consigliatissimo.
Dista da Tample Bar circa 20min a piedi, piacevolissima camminata lungo il Liffey River, da visitare la cattedrale di St.Patrich, il castello di Dublino, Tample Bar, la Guinness StoreHouse e il parco cittadino.

206,molto bene,"Direi molto bene, comunque niente di straordinario. Le camere sono belle e spaziose. Curato ogni minimo dettaglio e anche il bagno √® in ottime condizioni. Rooftop carino nel periodo estivo. Considerando quanto offre Dublino (a mio avviso a certi livelli - poco o nulla) √® un buon compromesso per un drink con gli amici. 
La spa √® straordinaria: nulla da dire. Peccato solo che la sala relax sia riservata solo a chi prenota i trattamenti. Non capisco il motivo. 
Cucina nella norma. Posizione un po' troppo decentrata al centro. 
Consigliato.",4,2019,09,20

206,El peor 5* en el que he estado!!!!,"He estado esperando unos d√≠as a ver si se me pasaba el cabreo por haber elegido este Hotel, pero creo que todav√≠a lo tengo pues me estropearon las vacaciones. Todo empez√≥ en la llegada donde nos comunican que las habitaciones que hab√≠amos reservado comunicadas que no pod√≠an darlas (reservado desde hace meses y confirmado por el Hotel!!) sin ninguna otra opci√≥n ni alternativa, simplemente que tendr√≠amos dos habitaciones no comunicadas, cuando era fundamental pues viaj√°bamos con dos ni√±os peque√±os..Despu√©s de protestar, (lo √∫nico que pod√≠amos hacer) nos dicen que ma√±ana nos ponen en una habitaci√≥n de esquina suite fant√°stica y con una habitaci√≥n comunicada. Esa noche no pudimos ni deshacer las maletas que llev√°bamos adem√°s para 8 noches en el Hotel.
Al d√≠a siguiente la supuesta habitaci√≥n suite es simplemente una habitaci√≥n de esquina en la segunda planta con las peores vistas posibles hacia la trasera del edificio, las vistas eran todav√≠a peor en la contigua donde la ventana ten√≠a un muro enfrente. Por no liarla all√≠ nos quedamos...
Despu√©s todo en la estancia ni mucho menos a la altura de un Leading Hotel of the World o un Cinco estrellas. Servicio de habitaci√≥n p√©simo, restaurante lamentable, desayuno muy justito y el servicio p√©simo. En definitiva semana lamentable en un hotel supuestamente de Lujo....",1,2019,08,13
206,Ottimo ma non perfetto,"Hotel ottimo, in posizione centrale ma non centralissima e per questo comodo. Tutti i vantaggi e le belle cose di questo hotel, le avete kette nelle recensioni precedenti.

Zwischendurch auf der quirligen Terrasse noch Kaffee getrunken. Mit dem Bus f√§hrt man zum Trinity College knapp 10 Minuten, auf der anderen Seite des Liffey erreicht man gut die Stra√üenbahn z. B. Richtung Bahnhof Heuston. Der Pool ist lang und schmal und insgesamt etwas dunkel. Lange ge√∂ffnet. Spa und Gym gibt es auch. Seinen Preis ist es wert. Mitglied bei Leading Hotels of the World.

206,Unterdurchschnittlich,"Im Vergleich mit anderen H√§usern der LHW-Kategorie f√§llt das The Marker Hotel deutlich ab. Das Haus und die Zimmer waren vor l√§ngerer Zeit ggf. modern.

206,"Super Lage, Super Service","Es war der zweite Aufenthalt in Dublin, wof√ºr wir The Marker gew√§hlt haben, sicherlich beeinflu√üt durch die Mitgliedschaft bei Leading Hotels, aber auch die Lage. 
An der Rezeption ging es flott, bekamen auch ein Upgrad f√ºr ein Zimmer mit einer sch√∂nen Aussicht. Die R√§ume sind von der Gr√∂√üe gut, das Bad ist ger√§umig, lediglich die Toilette k√∂nnte separat sein. Der Schlafkomfort ist toll. F√ºr ein Wochenende war die Schrankfl√§che ausreichend, dar√ºber hinaus wird es problematisch.
Es gab einen Gru√ü von der Hauskonditorei sowie eine Flasche Wasser.
Die Roof-top Bar ist ein Erlebnis, einerseits vom Ausblick aber auch von der Auswahl der Cocktails.
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war auch sehr gut, wie √ºberall von einem erstklassigen Service begleitet. Auch gibt es jeden Abend einen Turn down Service, der leider heute nicht mehr √ºberall anzutreffen ist.
Wir konnten auch einen late check-out bis 14 Uhr in Anspruch nehmen. Damit wirklich ein toller Aufenthalt, zumal man das neue und alte Dublin von dort aus fantastisch erkunden kann.",5,2019,05,15
206,√úberbewertet und unterk√ºhlt ,"Aufgrund der vielen guten Bewertungen haben wir f√ºr diesen Dublintrip das Marker gew√§hlt. Zimmer und Fr√ºhst√ºck √ºberzeugen. Minuspunkte waren die schummrige Beleuchtung im Bad und die  Garderobe, welche (als einzige Option)als Kleiderschrank dienen musste. Der Portier und die Empfangsmitarbeitenden waren, was das Personal betrifft ein Lichtblick. Im Service gr√∂√ütenteils ungelernte und dazu unfreundliche Kr√§fte. In der Brasserie wurden unsere Gl√§ser wortlos abger√§umt; keine Chance etwas nachzubestellen. Auf Nachfrage teilte uns der Manager sehr bestimmt mit, dass dies der Hotelstandard sei. Na gut, wir sa√üen dann noch 20 Min am leeren Tisch, bis es uns gelungen ist, eine weiter Bestellung aufzugeben. Dazu war das Essen f√ºr ein Hotel dieser Klasse unterirdisch. 
Der Wellnessbereich war w√§hrend unserem gesamten Aufenthalt geschlossen. Da wir einen Shopping-Wellness Trip geplant hatten, waren wir entsprechend entt√§uscht. Der Ausfall wurde mit einem Drink entsch√§digt.....

Sono stato un paio di notti in una corner room. La stanza molto spaziosa, ben corredata, con un bagno grande, letto comodo e tutto quello che deve esserci vista la categoria dell'hotel e la membership al Leading Hotel.
Rapporto qualit√†/prezzo se penso a simili hotel in altre capitali, direi molto bene.
Non conosco se esistono camere con vista sul fiume/mare, ho notato esserci un rooftop bar ma credo ora sia chiuso per via della stagione. Altrimenti niente vista. 
Il palazzo √® moderno fatto a vetrate ed essendo in mezzo ad altri palazzi simili non offre una grande sensazione di privacy.
Ho dato un punto in pi√π per la SPA, con tra le altre, una piscina e jacuzzi davvero notevoli vista la locazione al piano ammezzato.
Colazione completa sebbene non sontuosa come altrove. Mancano un po' di lievitati, ma qui non si usa tanto. Inservienti peraltro molto gentili. Un po' di frenesia nell'aria la mattina in quella sala, non mi ha rilassato.
Il bar ok i prezzi, il cocktail so so, ma dico sforzati oltre ai due tipi di salatini...

206,"Tolle Lage, sensationell freundliches Personal!","Das moderne Hotel liegt im neuen Hafen/Finanz-Technik-District. Die Lage ist super, die Umgebung stylish. Wir hatten im 6. Stock Zimmer mit spektakul√§rem Blick √ºber den Dock Square. Diese Zimmer haben kleine B√§der in schwarz, mit kleinen Duschen, wenig Licht, wenig Stauraum und tiefen WCs und Waschbecken. Der Architekt hat sich hier offensichtlich f√ºr Design und gegen Funktionalit√§t entschieden. Deshalb steht auch auf dem Sideboard im Zimmer zus√§tzlich ein kleiner Kosmetikspiegel, damit frau sich bei vern√ºnftigem Licht schminken kann. Auch die Rasur empfiehlt sich au√üerhalb des Badezimmers. Die Zimmer, die zur anderen Seite des Flurs hinausgehen, haben deutlich gr√∂√üere Badezimmer in cremefarbenem Styling mit Badewanne und vor allem mit viel besser Beleuchtung. Daf√ºr fehlt dort der tolle Ausblick. Man sollte auch unbedingt nach einem Zimmer ohne Verbindungst√ºr fragen, damit man nachts seine Ruhe hat. 
Der Schlafkomfort in den Betten ist gro√üartig. Die Rooftopbar ein echtes Highlight. Und der Service durch die Mitarbeiter ist gro√üartig! Wir hatten einen Geburtstagskuchen bestellt, der einfach genial war: wei√üe Schokolade mit Raffalleocreme, sehr zu empfehlen! Danke an den Patissier, eine Meisterleistung! Vielen Dank an Vladimir, der sich sensationell um unser Wohlergehen gek√ºmmert hat. Und Danke auch an Unna!",4,2018,07,10
206,"Moderno, impeccabile, al posto giusto!","Un albergo in cui tutto sembra semplice, facile, buono... in realt√† grande attenzione ai dettagli, professionalit√† e freschezza di ogni particolare lo rendono godibilissimo. Ad un prezzo pi√π che corretto per quanto offerto.",5,2018,07,09
206,Perfektes Hotel,"Perfektes Wohlf√ºhlerlebnis in Dublin: Wir waren √ºber St.Patricks-Day hier und haben wohlf√ºhlende vier Tage im The Marker verbracht. Das Zimmer verf√ºgte √ºber Bad und Dusche; bodentiefe Fenster mit Blick auf den Kanal haben uns einige Male den Drink auf dem Zimmer nehmen lassen. Das Personal war aufmerksam und immer um einen bem√ºht. In 20 min. ist man zu Fuss in der City, aber auch der Spaziergang ans Meer lohnt sich. Wir kommen gerne wieder!",5,2018,03,21
206,F√ºr Business- oder Weekend-Trip super,"Wir waren auf Empfehlung einer Bekannten zu Gast. Das Hotel ist sehr modern und verf√ºgt √ºber eine tolle Bar in der Lobby. Der Wellnessbereich ist f√ºr ein city Hotel √ºberdurchschnittlich grossz√ºgig (tolles gym, sch√∂nes/grosses Hallenbad, Whirlpool, Dampfbad und Sauna). Das Zimmer war sehr ger√§umig, modern, sauber und hatte ein tolles Bad. S√§mtliche Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten sind fussl√§ufig zu erreichen. Der Service war ebenfalls perfekt. Ganz besonders gut war das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet! Wir werden das Hotel auch beim n√∂chsten Dublin-Besuch definitiv wieder buchen!",5,2018,01,28
206,Ein wirklich tolles Hotel,"Das Hotel ist im neuen Finanz- und Tech-Distrikt. Zu Fuss rund 20 Minuten vom Zentrum entfernt. Von hier aus lassen sich viele Erkundungen zu Fuss unternehmen. Das Personal ist √§usserst hilfsbereit, zuvorkommend und freundlich. Die Infrastruktur ist makellos, man kann auch im Hotel bleiben, essen, trinken, auf dem Dach die Aussicht geniessen und das Nichts-Tun zelebrieren. Auch die Umgebung ist sehr sch√∂n und inspirierend.",5,2017,12,26
206,bello e rilassante,"Sono stato in questo Hotel a Novembre, un design molto bello, luci rilassanti, una buonissima colazione.
Complimenti a Ruan al front office, bravo e sempre disponibile.
La posizione √® ottima, in 10-15 minuti a piedi si arriva nella zona centrale della citt√†.",5,2017,11,07
206,Das beste Haus in Dublin,"The Marker in Dublin, ist das erste Haus am Platz. Alles ist perfekt, der Service sehr freundlich, hilfsbereit und nett.

206,Una coccola,"Ho adorato questo hotel, decisamente il migliore che io abbia mai trovato a Dublino.
Personale estremamente attento e cordiale senza essere invadente.
stanza molto grande, estremamente pulita, letto comodissimo, bagno enorme con box doccia, vasca da bagno e riscaldamento a pavimento.
bellissimo il buffet della colazione con vista su gran canal square.
l'unico hotel di questa citt√† che vale veramente quello che si paga.
non vedo l'ora di tornarci.",5,2017,10,14
206,Classe ed eleganza a Diblino,"Bellissima struttura in una moderna zona di Dublino in piena trasformazione. L‚Äôhotel si affaccia su Grand Canal Square, proprio accanto al teatro progettato da Daniel Libeskind. Molto cortese e professionale, piena di sorrisi e premure ma non invadente, l‚Äôaccoglienza al check-in. Camera elegante e spaziosa, letto comodissimo, bagno con vasca e doccia. Ottima e abbondante la colazione. La cena √® stata una bella esperienza, in un ambiente elegante, ma non ingessato. Ottima la presentazione dei piatti. Perfetta la sogliola di Dover accompagnata dal pur√® di patate. Per il relax ci sono piscina,spa e una palestra. Molto bella la piscina, che ha anche il vantaggio di essere aperta gi√† dalle 6 di mattina. Spaziosa e molto piacevole la vasca per l‚Äôidromassaggio. Qui la giornata a Dublino comincia nel migliore dei modi.",5,2017,09,30
206,Tolles Hotel!,"Ein super Hotel mit toller Lage, gro√üen Zimmern und nettem Personal! Die Dachterrasse ist absolut f√ºr einen sundowner zu empfehlen! Ich w√ºrde hier immer wieder herkommen, da das Hotel einen klasse Standard hat aber auch chi-chi verzichtet. ",5,2017,09,03
206,Ottimo hotel,"Servizio pulizia e gentilezza. Bellissima location e vicinanza con tutti i trasporti pubblici. Unico appunto: se si √® in viaggio turistico, non avere disponibili il bellissimo rooftop e la brasserie oltre le 21 √® veramente un peccato. Un hotel su misura per il business, meno per il turismo.",4,2017,08,26
206,Una grata sorpresa,"Ubicado en la antigua zona portuaria y que hoy en d√≠a es una de las zonas de mayor expansi√≥n de la ciudad encontramos este moderno hotel que ofrece unas amplias y bonitas habitaciones y un servicio superior con atenci√≥n a los detalles.
El servicios de desayuno es espectacular, as√≠ como la terraza/bar de la planta baja como el bar en la azotea.
Recomendable 100%",5,2017,08,16
206,I loved it,"Ein tolles Hotel. Es war alles perfekt. Ich kann es nur empfehlen. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. F√ºr jeden, der sich einfach etwas gutes und sch√∂nes g√∂nnen m√∂chte.Ich konnte die Umgebung leider nicht besichtigen, aber so wie ich es gesehen habe, gibt es sch√∂ne Lokale in der Umgebung. Ein Spaziergang w√§re sch√∂n gewesen. Bei meiner n√§chsten Dublin Reise m√∂chte ich wieder dort absteigen.",5,2017,08,14
206,Excelente hotel en la Ciudad de Dublin,"Muy buen hotel con excelente servicio, un poco lejos del centro de la ciudad, pero lo recomiendo ampliamente!!!
Los cuartos muy bonitos y espaciosos, moderno y elegante.
Muy buena opci√≥n para visitar con la familia!!",5,2017,08,06
206,Sehr sch√∂ner Aufenthalt,"Das Hotel liegt ruhig und dennoch citynah in den Docklands. Der Service ist unaufgeregt, freundlich und professionell, die Zimmer ger√§umig. Einzige Einschr√§nkung: es h√§tte etwas mehr Schrankfl√§che sein d√ºrfen. Bar und Fr√ºhst√ºck topp. Einzige Einschr√§nkung hier: Die Weltallmusik im Fr√ºhst√ºcksraum nervte etwas. Insgesamt: ein stylishes Hotel mit gro√üem Wohlf√ºhlfaktor.",5,2017,08,05
206,Super Hotel in den Docklands,"Das Hotel liegt in den Docklands und ist umgeben von architektonischen Highlights.
Es ist sehr gut gelegen und man kann das Stadt Zentrum unkompliziert zu Fuss erreichen.

Das Personal ist durchweg sehr freundlich und behandelt alle Anliegen professionell und zuvorkommend. 

Die Zimmer sind sehr ger√§umig sowie modern eingerichtet und man f√ºhlt sich direkt wohl dort.

Das Hotel ist absolut zu empfehlen und bei unserem n√§chsten Dublin Besuch, werden wir sicher wieder hier einchecken.",5,2017,08,02
206,Perfetto,"Hotel in zona tranquilla e vicina al centro.Funzionale ben organizzato con camere belle e pulite. Ottima la piscina e la colazione. Personale gentilissimo e professionale.Non ho provato il ristorante ma presumo sia della medesima qualit√†.
",5,2017,07,17
206,Perfect stay,"Everything was PERFECT.
For details now in German: Das Hotel liegt am Grand Canal Dock, dort ist es kaum Verkehr, sehr angenehm. Das Zimmer hatte eine sch√∂ne Gr√∂√üe.Jeden Tag gab es kostenloses Mineralwasser.
Das Personal war durchweg sehr freundlich, hilfsbereit und aufmerksam.",5,2017,06,28
206,Fant√°stico,"Bonito y confortable hotel con todas las comodidades y detalles. La habitaci√≥n espaciosa  con camas muy c√≥modas y el suelo del cuarto de ba√±o con calefacci√≥n. El personal muy amable, sobre todo, Stefen que nos aconsej√≥ sobre d√≥nde cenar y fue todo un acierto. Excelente opci√≥n.",5,2017,06,28
206,sch√∂nes Hotel in den Docklands,"Wir kamen sp√§t abends vom Flughafen (30 Min mit dem Auto) am Hotel an und wurden freundlich begr√º√üt.
Der CheckIn verlief sehr schnell und wir konnten sofort das Zimmer beziehen.
Das Zimmer war gro√üz√ºgig und sehr sch√∂n eingerichtet. Im Bad gibt es die M√∂glichkeit eine Fu√übodenheizung einzuschalten. Au√üerdem gibt es f√ºr das gesamte Zimmer eine Klima/Bel√ºftungsanlage. Die l√§uft leider durchg√§ngig und hat beim Schlafen gest√∂rt.
Der Wellnessbereich war sehr sch√∂n, leider verf√ºgte er nur √ºber 4 Liegen, 6 Sitzkissen und 2 St√ºhle. Die Sitzkissen laden nicht zum Verweilen ein, mehr Liegen w√§ren w√ºnschenswert. Beim CheckIn vom Wellnessbereich befindet sich eine Liste, hier muss man Name, Zimmernummer, Eintrittsuhrzeit und Unterschrift hinterlegen. Solche Listen finde ich nicht zeitgem√§√ü und man kennt, dann auch Name und Zimmernummer der anderen G√§ste. Warum man dies nicht geschickter l√∂st, ist mir bei solch einem modernen Haus ein R√§tsel.
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war ganz gut. Die Dame am Fr√ºhst√ºcks-Empfang d√ºrfte durchaus ein wenig netter sein. Aber man findet beim Fr√ºhst√ºck alles was man will und es gibt noch eine A-la-carte Karte.
Die Rooftop-Bar sollte man einfach mal besucht haben, der Ausblick ist fantastisch.

Das Hotel kann ich weiterempfehlen, allerdings hat mich die durchg√§ngi laufende Bel√ºftungsanlage (obwohl sie ausgeschaltet war) genervt.",4,2017,06,15
206,Stile moderno in un ottimo contesto,"Ci ho soggiornato a cavallo del nuovo anno, la stanza molto grande e confortevole, il bagno ben attrezzato. Personale gentile e disponibile. Sul roof c'√® un bellissimo bar panoramico dove consumare qualcosa. Al piano terreno un altro bar con personale gentile e ottimi drink. Per raggiungere il centro √® necessario prendere un taxi o farsi una bella passeggiata.",4,2017,05,17
206,Sehr zu empfehlen,"Waren mit der Familie einige Tage in Dublin und waren zum ersten Mal im Marker. Absolut empfehlenswertes Hotel. Sehr gut gelegen - zu Fuss in's Zentrum, Temple Bar, Trinity College etc. Wundersch√∂ne, moderne Zimmer und vor allem ein ausgezeichneter Service in allen Belangen. Concierge, Reception, Housekeeping, Portier - alle immer bester Laune und sehr hilfsbereit. Jederzeit wieder!!!",5,2017,05,03
206,Top Hotel - Nr. 1 in Dublin,"Ich war zum zweitem Mal im ""the Marker""  in Dublin und war diesmal vom Service und der gesamten Qualit√§t des Hauses begeistert. F√ºr mich die klare Nr. 1 in Dublin. Lediglich das Fr√ºhst√ºck k√∂nnte noch etwas umfangreicher sein, wenig Brotauswahl. Auch die Lage des Hotels ist TOP. 
",5,2017,04,26
206,Zentrales Hotel in den Docklands,"The Marker Hotel ist sehr zentral, im pulsierenden Business Distrikt Dublin's gelegen. Ideal f√ºr Gesch√§ftsreisende. Zu Fuss ist man in 15-20min auch schnell in der historischen Innenstadt. Die Ausstattung ist sehr gut, die Zimmer sind gro√üz√ºgig geschnitten. Nachts ist es sehr ruhig. Der Fitnessbereich ist ebenfalls sehr ansprechend ausgestattet. Absolut empfehlenswert f√ºr Gesch√§ftsreisende",4,2017,03,08
206,Fantastico,"Amplias habitaciones, excelente desayuno, modernas instalaciones, espectacular terraza y spa, silencioso, moderno atenci√≥n exquisita, el mejor hotel de DUBLIN hoy d√≠a. Amenities de ba√±o y ducha fant√°sticos.",5,2017,02,12
206,Ein wunderbares Hotel in Dublin,"The Marker macht so ziemlich alles richtig. Ein professionell gef√ºhrtes Hotel etwas ausserhalb des Trubels, das mit dem Taxi gut zu erreichen ist. Das ansprechende Design spiegelt sich in allen R√§umen wieder und vermittelt Ganzheitlichkeit. Das Personal ist stets zuvorkommend und die Reinigungsfachfrauen sogar herzlich. Der Spa-Bereich ist grossz√ºgig und bietet ein breites Angebot.
Die Kleinigkeiten am Rande; schwankende Wassertemperaturen unter der Dusche, eine iPhone-Docking-Station f√ºnf Generationen zur√ºck und die gef√§hrlich rutschigen Fliessen im Schwimmbad.
",4,2017,01,01
206,Il miglior hotel a Dublino,"Hotel moderno e curato nei minimi dettagli. Stanze spaziose, pulite e dotate di ogni comfort. LA spa √® eccezionale, cos√¨ come l'attenzione mostrata dal personale verso i propri ospiti. Colazione adeguata. Avrei gradito solo una maggiore scelta di piatti al menu del Marker Bar, ma tutto quello che ho provato era ben cucinato. Sono stato solo una notte, ma certamente sar√† sempre il mio hotel nelle mie permanenze a Dublino.",5,2016,12,22
206,Valido,Nonostante non si trovi in una posizione centrale l'hotel √® confortevole e offre camere ampie e pultie. Lo staff veramente simpatico e gentile. Bello la spa e direi ottima anche la colazione abbondante e varia.,5,2016,11,24
206,sehr guter service aber an schlaf war nicht zu denken,"Auf Grund von permanenter Umluftger√§usche war die Nacht katastrophal und an Schlaf nicht zu denken. Das Problem konnte nat√ºrlich nachts nicht behoben werden. Schade, denn an sonsten ist das Hotel in Punkto Service nichts schuldig geblieben. Aber ein Hotel ist, auch wenn es noch so gut ausgestattet ist, in erster Linie zum schlafen da.  ",2,2016,11,14
206,Giusto lusso ,"Quartiere nuovo ex zona portuale. Bella ristrutturazione. Ottimo albergo lusso, camere comode ben insonorizzate. Bella la spa: palestra e piscina di livello. Ottima colazione e personale... sorridente! Mi sono trovato bene! 
",5,2016,10,16
206,"muy recomendable, con buen servicio","es un hotel muy confortable, habitaci√≥n espaciosa, el suelo del ba√±o es calefactable cosa que se agradece mucho. El servicio de recepci√≥n muy atento, te ayudan en cualquier cosa que necesites. El dise√±o del hotel es bastante correcto por todo lo que hay en dublin, y la zona esta muy bien",4,2016,10,14
206,Wunderbar,"Das ""The Marker"" liegt sehr ruhig an den Docks von Dublin.
Diese Ruhe war w√§hrend unseres Aufenthalts auch dringend notwendig, da in der Innenstadt enorme Stra√üenarbeiten vorgenommen wurden und dies mit gro√üer L√§rmbel√§stigung einher ging.
Die Zimmer sind sehr ger√§umig und sauber.
Der Service vom Concierge und dem Lobbypersonal ist grandios. Jeder Wunsch wird erf√ºllt.
Das Restaurant ist sehr zu empfehlen sowie auch die Rooftopbar. Welche eine tolle Sicht auf Dublin preisgibt.
Ich w√ºrde empfehlen bei einer Reservierung das Fr√ºhst√ºck gleich mitzubuchen, es ist wirklich vorz√ºglich.
Wir kommen immer gerne wieder zur√ºck.",5,2016,09,13
206,Inmejorable,"La situaci√≥n Es fabulosa y la calidad Del establecimiento excelente,destacar la limpieza de la habitaci√≥n y la atenci√≥n del personal.Gracias Stephano por tu amabilidad,en todo momentous fuimos atendidos en espa√±ol",5,2016,09,03
206,Absolute Empfehlung!,"Interessante Lage im modernisierten, aber nicht seelenlosen Dockland-Quartier mit Aussicht auf Hafen-Anlagen. Sehr professionell und freundlich, aber keine Spr√ºche-Aufsager. Man k√ºmmert sich. Fr√ºhst√ºck sehr gut. Sch√∂ner Pool, nettes Gym. Auf dem Dach eine Bar, die wir leider nicht besucht haben. Fantastische Suite mit allen Annehmlichkeiten. Jederzeit wieder!",5,2016,08,21
206,"Simplemente, perfecto.","Este hotel es muy nuevo y est√° situado en Grand Canal Sq. justo en medio de toda la zona de desarrollo de Dublin a la que a√∫n le faltan unos pocos a√±os para convertirse en algo parecido a los docklands de Londres, pero que ya apunta alto al ser sede de las principales compa√±√≠as tecnol√≥gicas (Facebook est√° en el edificio de al lado y Google a 8 minutos caminando).

Las habitaciones son sumamente espaciosas y silenciosas, con ba√±os espectaculares y con un servicio impecable por parte de todo el personal. 

",5,2016,08,19
206,Ottimo 5 stelle!,"Ottimo hotel, camere grandi e pulite, ottima anche la colazione (costa 24‚Ç¨, ce l'hanno proposta a 21,50‚Ç¨). Nulla da eccepire tranne l'area Termale, luci piuttosto cupe e atmosfera non cos√¨ rilassante.",5,2016,08,16
206,Non centralissimo adatto a grossi gruppi,"Non √® in posizione centrale (si trova nella zona di ufficio) nato quasi sicuramente per convegni e lavoratori girovaghi. Ma che hotel. Camera spaziosissima letto enorme e comodo. Cuscino alla italiana, confort di ogni tipo compreso asse di stiro e ferro da stiro. Bagno spettacolare unico neo nella nostra camera fatta per portatori di handicap la non presenza nella doccia di box doccia ma di telo plastico. Segnalo la disponibilit√† di un phon da casa con tre velocit√†. Trovare un difetto diventa veramente difficile. Colazione continentale e ricca, ottimo veramente. Se potessi gli avrei dato 4.5 ma dato quel piccolo difetto della doccia gli ho messo 4.",4,2016,08,14
206,Non centralissimo ma molto buono,"Ho trascorso quattro notti in due riprese,in questo hotel che difficilmente si puo' criticare:molto gentili e rapidi all'acceuil,ottime le camere con tutto il necessario e qualche interessante piccolo accorgimento (pavimento riscaldato in bagno)e pulite.Molto buono il breackfast e bello il bar del roof garden.Forse un po' caro, ma allineato con i prezzi di Dublino. Sempre sorrisi da tutto il personale: bravi",5,2016,08,08
206,Qualche ora di relax!,"Abbiamo prenotato un massaggio di coppia in questo stupendo hotel, e sono state 3 ore di completo relax! Lo staff della SPA √® cordiale e amichevole, ti mette a tuo agio e competente! Dopo il massaggio abbiamo approfittato della piscina e della zona relax, tutto √® stato favoloso! Consigliatissimo anche solo per qualche momento di relax, in una zona bellissima. ",5,2016,07,18
206,Hotelazo muy cerca del centro,"Si no te importa andar 15 minutos hasta el Temple Bar, es un hotel perfecto. Fui por trabajo y sus instalaciones son fant√°sticas. Lo que menos me gust√≥ fue su men√∫ de medio d√≠a en el restaurante. 
Las habitaciones son muy espaciosas, camas muy c√≥modas y ba√±o genial. Y la Wifi, funciona muy muy bien.",5,2016,06,22
206,Schickes Hotel in guter Lage,"Wir waren zum Ende unserer Irland-Rundreise f√ºr 3 √úbernachtungen im Marker  zu Gast und haben uns wohl gef√ºhlt. Unser Zimmer und vor allem unser Bad war sehr gro√üz√ºgig gehalten und sch√∂n gestaltet. Leider gab es nur sehr wenig Schrank-Raum, so dass wir zum Teil aus dem Koffer heraus gelebt haben. Die Mitarbeiter waren √ºberwiegend professionell freundlich aber nicht unbedingt herzlich. Allein der Portier, der uns in Empfang genommen hat, stach positiv hervor und war auch f√ºr einen kleinen Smalltalk offen. Die Rooftop-Bar haben wir leider nicht kennengelernt, da sie am Samstag-Abend bereits voll war. Man h√§tte als Hotelgast wohl jedoch vorher reservieren k√∂nnen. Die Lage vom Hotel ist super, am Service und an der Reinlichkeit gab es nichts zu bem√§ngeln. F√ºr einen Kurztrip mit wenig Gep√§ck w√ºrden wir das Hotel ggf. wieder buchen.",4,2016,06,20
206,Top Hotel,"Top Hotel! sehr gut gelegen, sehr freundliches und zuvorkommendes Personal. Das Essen (Restaurant) aber auch das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet sind Top-Klasse!

206,Hotelazo en Dublin.,"Hotel nuevo, (2014) con habitaciones excelentes, servicio impecable, spa y piscina estupendos, y ademas una terraza con un fant√°stico ambiente tarde-noche. El desayuno vale su precio.
Esta algo lejos del centro en cuanto ubicaci√≥n, pero en la zona nueva de Dubl√≠n, que no ver√≠amos si nos qued√°ramos en el centro. Son 20 minutos andando por el r√≠o a la zona tur√≠stica que merecen la pena.",5,2016,04,28
206,"Eleganza, cortesia, alto livello","Soggiorno in famiglia nel periodo di Pasqua, in quattro in due camere comunicanti: albergo nuovo, frequentato in genere per travet business, grandissima cortesia del personale, strutture nuove e moderne (free Wi-Fi, internet radio e TV).
Colazione ottima con materie prime fresche nonostante la ""latitudine"", con possibilit√† di ordinare da men√π (es., pancake, omelette, french toast).
Piscina e spa di grande livello, anche qui ottima accoglienza.
Bar e Brasserie con grande assortimento di piatti ma assolutamente non caro.

206,soggiorno stupendo !!!,"Abbiamo soggiornato per quattro giorni in questo modernissimo hotel per capodanno 2015, personale molto gentile e disponibile , pulitissimo , nuovo e dotato di ogni confort.le camere sono moderne arredate con gusto e classe, silenziosissime, moderne e con vista sul canale .Biancheria molto raffinata e letti comosissimi .
la spa con bellissima piscina merita devvaro la lode, sauna , bagnoturco e palestra attrezzatissima e moderna .

da provare anche il servizio in camera .
Unico neo se proprio vogliamo trovarlo potrebbe essere la posizione, infatti dista circa 20 minuti a piedi dal centro , ma infondo √® solo una piacevole passeggiata .",4,2016,02,12
206,L√§sst keine W√ºnsche offen ,"Waren f√ºr vier N√§chte dort, die das ganz Hotel ist sehr stylisch und modern eingerichtet. Das Zimmer war gro√ü und Tipp top gepflegt und sauber!

206,Unglaubliches Hotel!,"Wir waren dort w√§hrend des U2-Konzerts im November 2015 und haben dieses Hotel aufgrund des Standortes gew√§hlt. Der Preis war selektiv!

Aber was wir daf√ºr geboten bekamen, unglaublich! Ich bin mir zwar schon von London Service, Gastfreundlichkeit und Zuvorkomnis gewohnt aber die Irl√§nder haben das noch perfektioniert! Ich kann das Hotel jedem weiter empfehlen! Top!

Die Zimmer auch ""Senior"" wie unseres war jeden Betrag wert! Super!",5,2015,11,30
206,"E' sempre un piacere tornare a ""The marker Hotel""","E' la seconda volta che soggiorno in questo bellissimo albergo di Dublino.
L'albergo e' situato in una posizione fantastica, vicino ai docks ed in pochi minuti si e' in centro. Modernissimo, Stanze enormi e bagni altrettanto grandi. Super pulito. Il personale ti coccola, forse troppo.
Molto bello il bar situato all'ingresso.
Il wi-fi e' gratuito ovunque e tra l'altro e' uno dei pochissimi luoghi dove il wifi si connette senza necessita' di inserie userID o password e doverla inserire nuovamente ogni giorno.",5,2015,11,27

206,Splendido hotel,"√à situato in un'area molto cool di Dublino, splendide camere e servizio di qualit√† notevole. Breakfast a buffet, belllo il bar ma bellissimo il bar sulla terrazza all'ultimo piano. Ottimo anche per business, belle e luminose sale riunioni. Prezzi piuttosto alti.",4,2015,10,29
206,"modern und etwas ""k√ºhl""","Habe gesch√§ftlich einige Tage in diesem Hotel √ºbernachtet.

Die Zimmer sind ""modern"" eingerichtet (fast schon etwas ""k√ºhl"") und die Badezimmer erfreulich gro√ü und sauber. Leider ist der Kleiderschrank sehr klein geraten - auch f√ºr einen Mann :)

Ich hatte das Pech, am Sonntag Abend anzureisen und leider ist das Restaurant abends am Sonntag & Montag nicht ge√∂ffnet. Ist angesichts der einigerma√üen zentralen Lage kein allzugro√ües Problem, aber f√ºr ein 5* Hotel doch etwas seltsam. Und das ""Continental Breakfast"" k√∂nnte viel mehr Auswahl vertragen.

Aus meiner Sicht ""nichts besonderes"".",3,2015,10,08

Muy buena ubicaci√≥n, pero lo m√°s importante es la atenci√≥n del personal, especialmente el de la recepci√≥n. Tuve un peque√±o accidente, me lastim√© una ceja. Al minuto ten√≠a a tres personas atendi√©ndome por algo de muy poca importancia. Es un hotel muy recomendable, me sent√≠ muy bien a pesar de mi corta estada.",5,2015,09,24

Su √∫nica desventaja es que est√° un poco alejado del centro de Dubl√≠n, pero un bonito paseo de 15 minutos o un autob√∫s/taxis (est√° muy bien comunicado) merecen la pena a cambio del silencio y tranquilidad de su actual emplazamiento.

Die Aussicht von unserem Zimmer auf den Grand Canal Square war grandios. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich, aufmerksam und hilfsbereit. Das Essen war schmackhaft und die Bedienung hervorragend. Doch die Tische im Restaurant sind leider zu klein f√ºr Fr√ºhst√ºck und Essen.

206,General√ºberholung dringend notwendig,"Wer sich als eine der besten Adressen von Dublin positioniert, muss abliefern. Dies hat das Marker bei Weitem nicht erreicht. Abgesehen vom sehr freundlichen Personal und gut funktionierendem W-Lan/TV/etc. hat es in s√§mtlichen Belangen maximal ein ""durchschnittlich"" verdient. Das Zimmer war abgenutzt und nur oberfl√§chlich gereinigt. An Lampenhalterungen und dergleichen fanden sich Staubflocken, diverse M√∂bel wiesen scharfe Bruchkanten auf, die Wand hatte Flecken und L√∂cher, die Dusche war undicht, im Badezimmer fand sich ein Spinne, zwei Lampenschirme waren schief, ein Lampenschirm hatte undefinierbare Flecken und der Vorhang d√ºrfte ebenfalls gereinigt werden. Noch schlimmer war das Fr√ºhst√ºck. Die Auswahl sehr gering (2 Sorten Marmelade und Honig), das einzige Brot nebst Toast war sehr trocken, Butter gabs nur angeschwitzte direkt auf den Tischen und die Tische waren so klein, dass nur 1 Teller darauf platz fand. W√§re kein Problem, wenn der leere Teller wegger√§umt w√ºrde, wurde er jedoch nicht. Generell noch selten ein so schlechtes Fr√ºhst√ºck erhalten, geschweige denn in einem solchen Hotel zu einem Preis von gut 20 Euro pro Person.",2,2015,08,24
206,Modernes Luxushotel,"Die Lage im Docklands District mit Blick auf den Grand Canal ist, wie bei den meisten europ√§ischen Stadtentwicklungsprojekten in ehemaligen Hafengebieten, nichts f√ºr Romantiker.  Wer jedoch den spr√∂den Charme moderner Architektur mag, ist hier richtig. 

Es sind 2 Minuten zum Fluss Liffey, und l√§uft man an diesem entlang westw√§rts, ist man in 20 Minuten in O'Connell Street oder dem Temple Bar District.

Die √§sthetische Gestaltung  der schachbrettartigen Fassade des Marker ist sehenswert. 

Im Erdgeschoss befinden sich die Brasserie und die Bar. Auf dem Dach gibt es eine Rooftop Terrace, die w√§hrend unserer Aufenthalte jedoch immer geschlossen war. Dort wird Sonntagnachmittags auch das Drunch serviert, wo man Platten mit Vorspeisen, Snacks und H√§ppchen sowie Cocktails bekommen kann.

The Marker geh√∂rt zu Hotelassoziation The Leading Hotels oft he World (zu der z.B. das Adlon in Berlin geh√∂rt) und deshalb waren wir vom Design der Zimmer etwas entt√§uscht. Beide Zimmer sahen komplett identisch aus, inklusive des Wandschmucks. 

Die Ausstattung l√§sst jedoch keine W√ºnsche offen: Badewanne und Dusche, viele hochwertige Toilettenartikel, flauschige Badem√§ntel und Frotteeslipper. 

Am meisten begeistert hat mich das Fr√ºhst√ºck, wo hochwertige, regionale und internationale Produkte, angeboten werden und wo man die selbstgemischten Cerealien (ich empfehle The Marker Granola) und die unglaublich leckeren frisch gepressten S√§fte unbedingt probieren sollte.",4,2015,08,21

206,"Erster Eindruck Top, Personal super, Restaurant und Bar meist geschlossen","Unser erster Eindruck war echt super, das Perosnal ist stehts freundlich und meist auch bem√ºht. Am Ersten Tag (ein Samstag) waren auch sogar das Restaurant, in welchem man sehr gut essen kann, sowie die ""Roof Top Bar"", welche ich sollte sie einmal zwischendurch ge√∂ffnet haben auch sehr empfehlen kann (mann hat eine sehr sch√∂ne Aussicht auf die Umgebung des Hotels), ge√∂ffnet.
An den darauffolgenden Tagen waren diese geschlossen, zum essen wurden wir auf die Bar in der Lobby verwiesen, in welcher man auf, f√ºr ein Abendessen eher ungem√ºtlichen, niedrigen Tischen sitzt.
Die Zimmer selbst sind sehr sch√∂n und Modern wie auch der Rest des Hotels, der Spa Bereich ist auch sehr entspannend, wenn man darauf achtet zu Zeiten hin zu gehen in welchen keine Kinder erlaubt sind.
Achtung beim Auschecken! Wir hatten drei Zimmer auf unterschiedliche Namen reserviert, bei jedem wurden auf der Rechnung zu viele Fr√ºhst√ºcke sowie Massagen mehrfach verrechnet.
Wer √ºbrigens fr√ºh abreisen muss erh√§lt im Hotel kein Fr√ºhst√ºck, da laut Rezeption erst um 6 Uhr begonnen wird Fr√ºhst√ºck vorzubereiten und man somit auch kein zum Beispiel Croissant einzeln bestellen kann.",3,2015,08,12

206,"HOTEL DE LUJO: CALIDAD, MODERNO, GRAN SPA. POSIBLEMENTE EL MEJOR DE DUBLIN.","The Marker es un hotel de Dublin, situado en la zona moderna de la ciudad. Esta a poco minutos del centro despu√©s de un agradable paseo, sobre todo por la zona del r√≠o donde se puede ver unos bonitos edificios y puentes. Destacar los del arquitecto espa√±ol Calatrava. 
El hotel es moderno pero muy acogedor, las habitaciones son grandes, los armarios son peque√±os, el resto de 10, con un ba√±o amplio, ba√±era y ducha, la cama grande y muy c√≥moda. La zona de recepci√≥n amplia. El restaurante para desayunar muy amplio, la comida excelente. Tiene una terraza en el ultimo piso donde se puede tomar una copa, en invierno te dan una manta para que no pases fr√≠o. Tiene vistas de la zona nueva de la ciudad, el canal y de los edificios modernos como el teatro situado al salir del hotel. 
Destacar el Spa, gratuito para los hospedados en el hotel. Tiene una piscina muy larga para nadar, un yacuzzi, sauna y gimnasio con muchos aparatos.
Estuvimos un grupo de amigos  cinco d√≠as visitando la ciudad y otros lugares de Irlanda. Si tienes pensado visitar Dublin recomiendo este hotel.
Quisiera destacar la amabilidad de todo el personal del hotel, en especial a los espa√±oles que se desvivieron para que nuestra estancia fuera de maravilla. Los dos Jose, de Las Islas Canarias y La Rioja. Tambi√©n a la espa√±ola que est√° en la recepci√≥n.
Nota:
Solo un pero. Somos espa√±oles y no entiendo como no tienen un canal en castellano cuando somos m√°s de 300 millones de personas que hablamos este idioma. Tengo entendido que la relaciones p√∫blicas  es de M√©jico. Seguro que para nuestra pr√≥xima visita estar√° solucionado.

206,"Sehr gutes Hotel, sch√∂n gelegen. 15 minuten bis ins Stadtzentrum","Das Hotel ist sehr hochwertig, keine Frage. Da ich beruflich dort war, war die Lage f√ºr mich optimal. F√ºr einen Stadttrip sollte man bedenken dass man ca. 10-15 minuten zum Stadtzentrum unterwegs ist (allerdings kann man sch√∂n am Fluss entlang spazieren, oder eine Abk√ºrzung Richtung Trinity College nutzen).

Ich hatte nur 3 Kritikpunkte daher nur 4 statt 5 Sternen:

1.) Mein Badezimmer war behindertengerecht ausgestattet (positiv) allerdings hatte die Dusche einen Duschvorhang welcher zu kurz war. Dadurch hatte das Bad nach der Dusche jeweils unter Wasser gestanden. Hier erwarte ich von einem 5 Sterne Hotel eine Glast√ºr statt Duschvorhang.

2.) Bei dem Fr√ºhst√ºck wurde ich etwas zu oft gefragt ""ob auch alles in Ordnung sei"". Ich m√∂chte morgens meine Ruhe haben und da es Fr√ºhst√ºck buffet gibt, nehme ich mir einfach was ich brauche.

3.) Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet ist gut, alles frisch. Zwei kleine Kritikpunkte: Keine Bohnen (geh√∂ren f√ºr mich zu einem Irish Breakfast dazu) und es gab niemanden der beispielsweise frische Eier zubereitet. Das hatte ich in anderen Dublin Hotels schon gesehen und fand es sehr angenehm.",4,2014,10,25

Ci ho dormito e quindi non ho provato la colazione, n√® la zona benessere (piscina/spa), n√® la zona dedicata alle sale riunioni.

206,Un gran hotel con algunos peros...,"Nos alojamos tres noches en el hotel para visitar la ciudad. La experiencia ha sido positiva, sin embargo hay algunas cosas que quiero compartir para aquel a quien pueda servir.
El hotel no es que est√© lejos del centro, pero personalmente, si tuviera que volver, elegir√≠a una opci√≥n m√°s cercana. Los 25' andando no te los quita nadie, si vas por una avenida sin ning√∫n inter√©s tur√≠stico. Puedes elegir llegar paseando por la ribera del r√≠o, pero entonces el tiempo se puede convertir en 35' f√°cilmente. En el hotel te dicen que se tarda 15', pero no es cierto. Vamos, no es cierto, a menos que vayas corriendo o con la lengua fuera...
Otra cosa que no me gust√≥ es que el hotel tiene un restaurante (brasserie) pero cierra dos d√≠as a la semana. Teniendo en cuenta que del hotel al centro hay un paseo, el restaurante del hotel es una buena opci√≥n para cenar... pero claro, si te alojas s√°bado, domingo y lunes y cierran domingo y lunes... pues mal...
Por lo dem√°s, el personal es amable, hay una cafeter√≠a magnifica en la terraza, las habitaciones son amplias y el spa es muy agradable.
