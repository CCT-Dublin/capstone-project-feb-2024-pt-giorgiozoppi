209,Getaway in South Dublin,We appreciate the opportunity at check in to have a room available early. We accepted the offer / purchase an upgrade to a suite ready for us. We needed directions / instructions to shut off the HVAC late at night. Added note - reported to Front Desk - shower drain slow and light in entry way closet does not shut off. We appreciate the batteries changed in the room safe so we were able to use it. Look forward to our next visit to the Conrad.,4,2024,10,19
209,"Irish Charm, Comfort, & Service At Its Very Finest!","I stayed here for five nights in early August 2023 as a Hilton Diamond Member, and was blown away by their kindness, cleanliness, and lovely breakfast each morning.  Upon arrival at 10 AM at the hotel from an all night international flight on no sleep, Omegan at the front desk welcomed me to Ireland for the first time and handed me a lovely bottle of Irish water.  She really calmed my nerves, and put me at ease.  From that moment on, this hotel as well as the country of Ireland far exceeded my expectactions.  At first, Omegan said that my room was not ready, but she made some phone calls to find me a perfect, quiet one on the top floor that I could check into right away.  That meant so much to me.

Few hours later after a nice nap, I received a lovely bottle of wine and some welcome chocolates.  Tried their room service the first day, and everything I ordered was simply incredible.  The next day at breakfast I was absolutely amazed at the extensive array of foods on the breakfast buffet.  Never before have I seen fresh honeycomb at breakfast.  As a Hilton Diamond member, the breakfast buffet was complimentary and also included one hot made to order item from their a la carte menu.  Highly recommend the french toast and pancakes.

What really made this hotel property stand out was every single member of their staff which exhibited the highest levels of professionalism and kindness to all guests.  You could tell they truly cared about making lifelong memories in Ireland for their guests.  Special thanks to Judith at breakfast who always checked up on me, and even tracked down some Irish Sunday newspapers for me when most stores were closed.  And also to John Mario, who always stopped by to say hello and hear about my tours from the previous day as well as plans for my new day.

The hotel is in a very safe, central area of Dublin, and easy to walk to some lovely parks as well as Trinity College.  I had tickets to Riverdance one night, and it was just a short walk back afterwards.  Lots of museums are also close by.  I took advantage of their fitness center on two nights, and was quite impressed by how nice all the equipment was.  Water and cold towels are also provided.

If you're interested in a nice, relaxing Irish holiday where the staff will pamper you well each day, this is your spot.    My room was well appointed, and included fantastic tea/coffee selections, as well as a nightly turn down service with delicious pieces of chocolate left out for you.

Cannot wait to return to this magical property and Ireland one day in the future!  Thanks to all of its staff for providing me with a trip I will never forget.  I miss it already.",5,2023,08,13
209,Poor Experience Due to Blame Shifting and Documented Incompetence by the Front Desk & Upper Management Team,"Had a very disappointing one night stay--due to poor management by the hotel.  I'll tell my story below and you can decide whose fault it was.   I am a Diamond Member and booked my stay via the Amex FHR website.  I booked it months in advance.  About a month before the reservation they reached out to me via the Amex booking website with a message asking me to confirm I was coming.  Odd, but I said yes.   Then 1-2 weeks before they did the same. Odd but I said yes again.   Then 4 days before my stay I visited the hotel to drop off my bags so the hotel could hold them for me while I went on a tour and I told them I'd be back in 4 days for my stay.
When I arrived for my stay, the front desk could not find my reservation.  I showed them my reservation on the Amex website proving I still had an active reservation.  They said that didn't matter as someone had canceled it in their system.  Fine, but it wasn't me that canceled it and how was that my problem?  They seemed very unmoved, not at all apologetic, just confused, and said maybe they could get me their most entry level room (supposedly it was the only room they had) without all of my Amex FHR benefits and I would still pay a very high rate.  Their attitude was I should be grateful they still had a room as it was a busy weekend when the truth of the matter is, I had a reservation from MONTHS ago and they broke the contract, not me.  

The room itself was nothing special, small, and was more like a regular HIlton that needed an upgrade, not a Conrad.  Had I known this I would not have accepted their 3-star room and gone elsewhere.  
I took the room because it was late in the evening and I was leaving the next morning very early for an international flight.  Otherwise, I would have absolutely gone somewhere else.

Nobody from the hotel ever followed up.   I sent the GM an email 3 weeks after my stay and heard nothing.   Keep in mind, I'm a Hilton Diamond Member, someone who had a FHR reservation (which is an important travel agent to Conrad), and someone who had done nothing to cause all of this mess.    It was a busy weekend because there was a USA College Football game the prior weekend, which had the whole city overfilled with Americans and a Coldplay concert the day I was staying.  So while I can't prove it, it makes sense why they kept wanting to know if I was 'really coming"" and someone ""cancelled"" my reservation without permission.   They caved to pressure from other customers is my guess--although I can't prove it.  But even if my supposition is wrong and it was just a computer glitch, the way they handled it (by not handling it and not engaging with me) was childish, embarrassing, and a great way to put this Diamond Member off Conrads for quite a while if not permanently.  

I'm sure the hotel will make some kind of face-saving reply to my review, either challenging the veracity of the review (do it, I've got everything documented to prove every word I said) or they will be apologetic but I don't need them to be apologetic in a review, I needed them to act when I was there or have replied to my email follow-up correspondence with the GM.",2,2024,10,10
209,Could be better,"I was excited to try a Conrad hotel for the first time. This hotel has several pluses and minuses.  The pluses were the breakfast, bartender, room size, and the location. The biggest plus was the concierge, Diego, who went above and beyond.

The minuses are that the hotel looked dated and seemed very short on staff to guest ratio. Our concierge got our luggage and took it to the room. This is the first time I’ve been in a hotel where they didn’t have separate staff for that. Seemed very odd. Walking around the hotel throughout my stay I pretty much saw no staff in the common areas, except the concierge, again, handling luggage. 

I’d look at another option if I was to go back to Dublin. Expected more from a 4*, supposedly higher end hotel.",4,2024,10,05
209,Very Nice Hotel - Good Location,"Conrad Dublin is a nice hotel tho somewhat impersonal feeling.  Our room was pleasant and pretty large - we were upgraded but the only difference in the upgrade was a better view on a higher floor.  The view was not particular good - an ""alley way""..hard to even see the view because the sofa is in front of the window.  The bed was comfortable and the shower was good.  We enjoyed the breakfast - our server was William each morning - a very nice and helpful person.  The location was only a five minute walk to St Stephen's Green - lots of restaurants within a 15 minute walk (Los Tapas de Lola).  We enjoyed our stay and can recommend Conrad Dublin.",4,2024,09,27
209,Dog friendly afternoon tea,"Beautiful, central, dog friendly hotel with excellent service and food. Dogs are always so welcome. My dog and I enjoyed a lovely afternoon tea with plenty of sweet and savory snacks for the humans and special afternoon tea menu for the dogs. Highly recommend the hotel and we will definitely be back.",5,2024,09,26
209,Great hotel in central Dublin,"Excellent hotel, great location in the center, walk to every attraction Dublin offers. Quiet. Great restaurant and wonderful breakfast. Special thanks to Theresa in the front desk for being very professional and friendly, above and beyond.",5,2024,09,16
209,Excellent Stay,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Conrad.   The hotel is in a great location, neat St Stephen's Park a short (10 minute) walk to Grafton Street but in a quiet area.   The hotel rooms are very clean, quiet and comfortable.    The team members at the hotel are outstanding--really welcoming and friendly.  In fact, Judith (hostess at the restaurant) remembered me from a prior stay about a year ago as did James (concierge).      I recall from my prior stay how welcoming the staff at the hotel were and experienced the same this stay.      They offered several suggestions of things to do that were all very helpful. 

I had breakfast at the hotel each morning and it was excellent.   In addition, I had dinner several nights at the Terrace (think that's the name--it was on level -1) and food and service were great!!   

I will definitely stay at the Conrad on my future Dublin visits!",5,2024,09,14
209,Great stay! Hope to return,"Spent September 3-9 at the Conrad Dublin. Nice hotel. Very clean and spacious rooms, wonderful breakfast (free for status members), great location, public transportation close by.  Received a welcome note and box of delicious local chocolates from staff. (Very much appreciated). Three restaurants on property. Lovely staff! Everyone was very helpful and welcoming. Emily at the front desk was very helpful as was the concierge staff. Rooms have AC and also windows that open.",5,2024,09,11
209,Our favorite Dublin hotel!,"Have stayed at over 50 Hilton hotels- in 6 countries- this one is amazing! The staff were exceptionally kind and helpful, the room was immaculate- I rarely (if ever) partook from a mini bar- but was very thirsty (already drank the complimentary water) and could not find a bottle opener. Called the front desk and a kind man brought me a bottle opener- he said they have a tendency to 'run off' as they are a high quality opener. I laughed and said if I ever took anything- it would be the soaps- the Mojave Ghost brand smells amazing! He smiled- then came back with a handful of soaps to thank me for being so kind about the trouble of no bottle opener. He was so nice and that soda tasted even better in such a great hotel! Loved everything and we plan to come back in a year with all our family- definitely staying here! Breakfast was delicious and St. Stephen's Green park just a few steps away! I am building our next home- was impressed by their selection of flooring transitions and clean lines- can't believe I forgot to take pics of the room!",5,2024,09,05
209,Amazing stay at the Conrad,"Our stay at the Conrad in Dublin was wonderful. We arrived early and though our room wasn’t ready yet, the staff at the hotel were quick to check our bags and get us taken care of. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable, and the linens were very nice. I thoroughly enjoyed the coffee station in the room also. The hotel’s breakfast was the best buffet we had on our stay in Ireland. Should we return to Dublin, we would certainly stay at the Conrad again.",5,2024,09,03
209,Would highly recommend,"This is a really lovely hotel.  We were celebrating our 30th anniversary and were pleasantly surprised with a delightful touch - cake and chocolates waiting in our room.
Towelling robes and slippers are of a high quality; lots of soft, fluffy towels, very comfortable bed and really good crisp bed linen.  We had a room with a balcony/terrace which was great.
Staff offer impeccable service and made us feel truly valued throughout our stay.
We would highly recommend.",5,2024,08,28
209,Everything great except climate control,"Our stay at the Conrad was lovely. The hotel is in a prime location and close to most attractions. The room was well-appointed with 6 large Nespresso pods, crystal glasses, a full-size ironing board, etc. Breakfast was delightful, and we were pleasantly surprised by the bloody mary and mimosa bars as well as an actual honeycomb from which you could draw honey. Our one huge disappointment was the lack of air conditioning. Our room was stuffy when we arrived and I toyed with the thermostat for a long time until I *thought* I had the A/C figured out. Actually I had turned on the heat, and I was sleeping with no covers and still sweating throughout the night until I turned it off. In the morning, I realized that the windows vented and offered a bit of cooler air. But the hotel really should provide some guidance on ventilation to prevent lots of frustration on the part of American tourists.",5,2024,08,24
209,Excellent hotel all around,"excellent hotel - very clean, very quiet.  We had an included breakfast, which is extraordinary in variety and quality.  A good experience all around.  More of a high end business orient rather than a family type of experience - it might be a bit rarified for young children.",5,2024,08,18
209,Favourite hotel in Dublin,"Just returned home from another fantastic stay at Conrad Dublin.    Superb lication, a 5 min walk thru the beautiful St Stephens Green Park leads you to the top of Grafton Steeet.  From check in to check out every staff member we encountered were friendly, courteous and extremely professional- as you would expect from a Conrad hotel.   We dines in The Terrace and once again the food was superb and the staff exceptional!   My favourite part of the stay is always the breakfast!   The Prosecco for Mimisas and the Bloody Mary station just lift the experience to another level. So many buffet & menu options to choose from to start your day.    Huge comfortsble beds and such a range of bathroom amenities!    Cant wait to return in December",5,2024,08,15
209,Quiet spot near all,"Recently enjoyed an excellent stay in Dublin at the Conrad! They acknowledged my Hilton status with an upgrade and breakfast. 
The breakfast was so so good! Wide variety of offerings on the Buffett plus you could also order off the menu!The service was very good and we always got a table with no problem.
All of the restaurant’s on site were great. We ate at the terrace three times, that is how good it is. 
Dinner at the  Coburg was delicious.
The barman from France in Lemule really knew his stuff! Great recommendations for different styles of Irish whiskies, a nice way to unwind from a day of sight seeing!
If you are planing on staying in Dublin to visit the many museums and historic sites, I highly recommend, the Conrad. Close enough to St Stephen’s green, but in a quiet, clean, safe block. I’m from NYC, and found Dublin’s city center gritty and had to navigate around some obvious druggies…  the Conrad was an oasis.",5,2024,08,10
209,Exceptional welcome,"I've stayed in the Conrad Dublin multiple times over the years (2-3 times per year minimum), and all of the times everything has been exceptional. Meets all the criteria of a very good 5 star property. 

From the check in, to the concierge everyone is exceptionally well trained and with amazing customer service skills.

I have stayed at all of the top hotels in Dublin multiple times, and the Conrad is absolutely the most consistent with its service, which is of an exceptionally high standard. The rooms are well appointed and the TVs etc are of a great size. The bar is also amazing, with great bartending staff. 

On this current stay, I would like to express my utmost gratitude to the lady who checked me in after a very tough day, thank you very much.",5,2024,08,03
209,"Good atmosphere, delicious food and exceptional customer service","We dined there for a mini birthday celebration. Food was delicious, arancini and asparagus  for starters, followed by beef and mushroom risotto minus the spinach as requested. Staff are very attentive and the place seems popular and it’s very central. Clean and efficient. We requested another bottle of the same red that we were drinking and were informed that due to deliveries it wasn’t possible. It was the only one in that part of the hotel. The restaurant in the main hotel is run by another company, Tis a pity that they couldn’t liaise. So we were offered two glasses of the more expensive wine. We didn’t bother with that and just ordered the bottle instead. Same thing happened us on a previous visit.
To our complete amazement the head of dining sent over a charcuterie with delicious cheeses and a selection of meats relishes and grapes and biscuits. This gesture saved the day and we managed to eat it. A thanks for our repeated custom. Well done young lady.",4,2024,07,24
209,Wonderful stay at the Conrad Dublin,"The Conrad Dublin is truly a remarkable hotel!  From the moment you enter the lobby you are treated like family!  Everyone is made to feel special.  We stayed 10 days on a recent visit and loved every minute.  The breakfast is totally amazing, the coffee is absolutely the best!  The staff is very attentive and strive to make your visit a memorable one.  The location is perfect with St Stephen's Green adjacent.  It is within walking distance of the Dart.  Thank you Conrad for a very relaxing vacation, one that we will never forget.",5,2024,07,23
209,Lovely hotel,"Really nice hotel, lovely staff and rooms were nice with comfortable beds, breakfast was great as-well.
Great amenities including a nice bar with lovely bartender and drinks. Lovely amenities in the room nice shower and bathroom in the double twin bed room. Staff were very kind and friendly including one in particular, the bartender Dimitri who helped us have a lovely night in the bar.",5,2024,07,19
209,"Clean, Quiet Comfort in Downtown Dublin","Very clean and comfortable with a great breakfast.  We had a regular room and a suite. It was easy to walk around town from this location.  It was better than expected!  The location is relatively easy with car park under hotel.   There a lot of places to walk to within 15 minutes, and there were always cabs available if needed.   

Pictures on website and Faceboob are all accurate.  I see n need to add more.

Problem:  We arrived at 3 pm ready to check in.  Our suite was available, but our room was not ready.  We had to wait 1.5 hrs for them to get it together on a Saturday.  We had arrived at the Dublin airport at 10 am, rented a car and made some side trips and had lunch to set our arrival at 3 pm.  Because of our delay getting into our room, we missed one of the museums we wanted to visit which closed at 5 pm.  Management could only apologize.  They compd us breakfast to try to make up for it.  All is good now.",5,2024,07,13
209,A solid hotel chain-like choice!,"A very solid chain hotel in a great location in Dublin. We coincidentally were in Dublin when the TS concert and a number of sporting events were in town. Even with that, the hotel was quiet and not too crazy. We opted for the inclusive breakfast which included the buffet or ala carte options which were good and the service was also quite good and friendly. It is in a good location, a couple of blocks from St. Stephens Green. The staff was lovely and responsive. The rooms and bathrooms are good sized but of a generic nature. Our bed was a little more firm than we are accustomed/prefer. Because of our timing and the lack of room availability in general in the city, we paid way more than we generally would have for a room like this. But a solid good choice!",4,2024,07,01
209,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed here for 5 days while visiting London. It lives up to the Conrad name with exceptional staff in every part of the hotel, lovely rooms, comfortable beds, great amenities. Restaurants and bars were great. Room service also good ( with the exception of soggy buns in the chicken sandwich). Very walkable location to many popular restaurants, Grafton St. and having St. James park so close was a bonus. The staff are really the icing on the cake- concierge and front desk staff were amazing.",5,2024,06,30
209,Hot room,There were a few issues.. the main was the temperature kept rising at night.. woke up several times to fiddle with the thermostat.. reported issue to front desk and was told it was set this way . Didn’t make sense.. the safe was broken and coffee maker too.. the hotel comped breakfast for our trouble.. we never received turn down service.. that was a bummer. The hot room prevented a good nights rest and that is why 3 stars.,3,2024,06,18
209,Very quiet with quality service and refinement,"I stayed one night recently and looked forward to Decompressing and relaxing. I enjoyed the property, enjoyed all 3 restaurants and savored walking around St Stephen’s Green. 

The bed and linens were of high quality, the bathroom was well appointed with a deep tub and nice amenities. I enjoyed the plush robe. 

I liked that there was a large desk to get organized at. 

The room felt clean and fresh. The turn down service was a nice touch that is rarer and rarer.",5,2024,06,15
209,Conrad’s staff are absolutely marvelous,"The hotel is excellent . The look and feel of the hotel are nice enough but it’s the staff that make the Dublin Conrad and wonderful experience . The servers in the breakfast room are top shelf, they are incredible, they ensure each starts off seamlessly . The valet/ bell services gentlemen are also impeccable. As are the staff in lobby bar each afternoon and at night. This hotel is my recommended hotel in Dublin , always, to all who ask my opinion .",5,2024,05,30
209,Luxury,"Amazing hotel with amazing staff. Ed, Levente, Matus, James and Tony are the best in the business. Sharing board for lunch is one of the best dining experiences we've had. Atmosphere in The Terrace is amazing and perfect for a summers day. Great Old Fashioned in the bar as well.",5,2024,05,28
209,Perfect Weekend Stay!,"Excellent stay in great location. We really enjoyed our return visit to Conrad Dublin. Great room, delicious breakfast and best service throughout our stay. Hilton Diamond status very well recognised. Will return soon! Kevin and Richard",5,2024,05,25
209,Hilton Diamond - Wonderful Experience,"Solo traveler visiting Dublin for the first time. Britt was extremely helpful during the check-in process, helping me arrange an early check in after a long flight. All of the staff was very friendly - including the bartenders, breakfast servers, and other front desk attendants. My luggage was delayed and they arranged for its safe arrival and even placed it in my room once it was delivered to the hotel. Would highly recommend when visiting Dublin, especially if you are a Hilton Diamond member.",5,2024,05,23
209,Another Great Stay,"I stayed at this hotel 17 years ago and it was still just as good as I remember.  The beds were so comfortable and the breakfast was amazing.  One day I had the buffet which had so many choices.  The other days, it was eggs Benedict, which were SO tasty.  The real gem of this hotel is the staff.  Everyone was so friendly and always willing to help. 

The hotel is very close to restaurants and a Tesco grocery store.  Very easy to walk many places from the hotel.  I will definitely stay here again next time I am in Dublin.",4,2024,05,20
209,"Visiting my 7 year old son’s 37th Country (Dublin, Ireland)","I visited this location in April 2024, with my 7 year old autistic son. I was a little worried at first because I had emailed the general manager Andrew Moore at least 4 times prior to arrival but he never responded back. At bare minimum at least acknowledge a Hilton Honors member’s email even if the reply is not favorable to me. I found out later that he was too busy preparing to leave his current position to start at another hotel (Waldorf Astoria Osaka). Instead I was contacted by Leyre (manager) who assured me that everything would be set-up perfect when we arrived and to my surprise it was. Leyre was so nice! The hotel sent a car to pick us up from the airport. There is a fee for this but it was worth it for me traveling with a child. We were able to get some breakfast because we arrived super early and our room was ready! This was perfect for me because it allowed us time to rest and freshen up a bit before we explored Dublin. 

The hotel is well appointed and accommodates those with special needs. Our room was nice and clean. I did bring an international adapter to charge our things because there was none in the room but there are USB ports. We had a junior suite which was perfect for us. Turn down service was offered and they give you chocolates which are delicious. The staff is extremely helpful. Everyone was so nice. We ordered room service a lot while there and the service was outstanding. 

It’s perfectly located close to the hop-on hop-off bus making it a breeze to get around town. Uber is also available. I recommend this hotel if you are in the Dublin area.",4,2024,05,13
209,One night in Dublin,Very welcoming staff and atmosphere!    Wonderful breakfast!   Everyone we encountered was so helpful on our first night in Ireland.    Our room was immaculate and so comfortable.  We took the advice and direction of two hotel concierges.   Doing so made our night in Dublin perfect.,5,2024,05,13
209,5 star service and the best Irish coffee,"The hotel was very clean and modern, it was perfectly located and it was not far walk from the main areas of Dublin City centre. The room was spotlessly clean, spacious and well equipped. The staff were so attentive and friendly and nothing was too much for them. Breakfast had plenty of options and the food was very delicious and bar was also great and the best Irish coffee. An absolute excellent stay all round and would definitely come back.",5,2024,03,30
209,Perfect,"Beautiful hotel , very accommodating staff , great breakfast. Would def recommend this hotel and would stay here again . Good location with great restaurants around it as well . Rooms were very clean and large for Europe and very comfortable beds . Staff was amazing",5,2024,03,30
209,Amazing experience,"Our Stay at the Conrad Dublin was amazing! The staff is super friendly, the bed is the most comfortable I've ever slept in and the food at both The Coburg and Lemuel's was super delicious. The location is very central and accessible from the airport, so if you are visiting Dublin, I recommend you stay here.

Thank you for your wonderful hospitality!",5,2024,03,27
209,In a great location for exploring Dublin.,"Upon arrival we were initially impressed as we walked in. 
5* feeling ‘lobby’ smells were good, it was clean. 
Booked a signature suite, called the boru suite, these are supposedly newish and there are only 4 in the hotel. Expensive per night. But we like nice things and are prepared to pay to get it. 
Location is desirable for those who want to be within walking distance to bars & restaurants. 
We had our dog with us and we did find this was definitely one of the more ‘pet friendly’ places we had travelled to throughout Ireland in whole. Dog bed, treat bag & blanket provided. We take our own for our pup but it’s a nice touch especially since you pay a fee to have them with you. There’s a park 2 minutes away and it’s a lovely place to walk, beautiful infact. 

The receptionist we presumed was in training. 
No mention of our HHonors status, breakfast time, room number or even directions to the lifts and amenities. Nothing. Reception service lacks ‘personality’ 
We found our own way around. 
First point of contact, this has to be spot on & creates your stay in my opinion. 
Create the ambiance, make me excited to stay here, this check in was like a head of hair when you don’t wash the conditioner out of properly.  Drab!

Nevertheless we proceed to the lift up to the room. 
Spacious, no spectacular views, your in a city after all. 
I like nice bathrooms & space, this was big enough to be more than comfortable for 2. 
Big walk in shower, bath, plenty floor space. 
Fan in the bathroom  made a weird noise that could have been detected by the cleaners but I stuffed some toilet roll in the fan and it silenced it. 
I really hate little things like this!! 
No fresh milk, another niggle of mine. Especially in prestigious rooms. Coffee machine was good, plenty to choose from and a good selection of teas. 
The room itself was clean, but I did wash the lipgloss marks off the cups.
My goodness…. the air conditioning/ heating system needs upgrading. Hence the noise in the bathroom. 
The system in the living area and the bedroom are difficult to navigate , really it’s a pain trying to turn them off & you need to if you like quiet.  They have done up these suites and updated the control boxes but not the overall system. It’s old. 

There’s also an interconnecting door, to the next room. 
They would have been aswell opening the door and sleeping in our room, there’s no sound proofing AT ALL. This really peed me off on the first morning hearing someone’s phone call @5am and the next night, simply noise.  
We are a grand a night to stay here…..but I wouldn’t care if I was £200, I want peace in my hotel room! It’s a hotels responsibility to provide that and live up to a 5* offering. 
There’s less road noise than room noise put it that way. 
There is no TV channels& yes it’s a given that you don’t go on holiday to watch tv, but I like to pop something on when I’m getting ready to go out for dinner or when we get back in put a movie on and chill out. 
This to me isn’t 5*& for many reasons I wouldn’t stay in this room again.
I am currently in a 5* in Vietnam& they have all the U.K. tv channels you can think of.!
Breakfast is disjointed. But the staff are really pleasant and were efficient. 
It’s buffet, self service, or options of a cooked selection from a menu on the table. The buffet is ok, not a fan of cooked things that have been sat for hours in heated trays really. But as I say you have other options (at a cost!)
It’s not a relaxed fine dining breakfast experience, it’s busy & noisy. 
We can’t comment on the restaurant as we didn’t eat here. 
Parking available under the hotel or a small fee extra you can have valet parking. 
Overall, the stay for 3 nights was ‘ok.",3,2024,03,26
209,The most amazing trip!,"My friend Poppy & I went to Dublin for her birthday trip & it was the best trip we’ve ever had! A MASSIVE thank you to Shane, he is amazing! He helped me organise a birthday package for my friend & he just went above and beyond for us. Everyone we met was so nice and kind! Thank you for the best trip",5,2024,03,25
209,Feel Like You're in the Movies,"The Conrad was an unbelievable experience.  From the moment we pulled up, it was like we were in the movies.  The service staff was incredible and everyone was extremely friendly.  They helped us with dinner reservations and the breakfast was delicious.  This was a special treat! Special thanks to the manager, Leyre, for handling our visit with thoughtfulness and care.",5,2024,03,24
209,The Finest Customer Service in an Older Dublin Hotel,"As to be expected at a Conrad, my two-night experience here was high-end and sublime in every way, but not without some areas for improvement. 

- Location: I prefer hotels that are not directly in the city center, but are still walkable or bus-able to the best attractions. The Conrad is a short walk from the peaceful St Stephen’s Green and very manageable to get to places like Grafton Street or St Patrick’s Cathedral using public transportation. The out-of-the-way location ensures a stay here is quiet and exclusive.

- Atmosphere: Sleek and refined, albeit older. They didn’t necessarily go all out to make the common areas spectacular (e.g. no ornate chandeliers or fountains of water), but I obviously didn’t require that. I did notice the carpets on my floor to be a bit stained and worn, and some of the glossy finishings on the walls and support beams had smudges on them—perhaps a renovation should be considered this year or next. However, I still enjoyed the vibe of the hotel.

- Service: The defining theme of my stay at the Conrad was the impeccable service I received. Every single member of staff was eager and willing to go above and beyond to help. I encountered an issue with my wheelchair charger during my stay (it broke due to the voltage discrepancy between US and Ireland), and the concierge team efficiently and hospitably arranged an accessible taxi ride to the nearest mobility repair shop, even offering to compensate me for the fare. The maintenance guy on duty worked so diligently to troubleshoot the existing issue and ensure my locally-bought charger would work without any hiccups. The whole team at the Conrad should be incredibly proud of the commitment to the highest level of attention to all guests!

- Amenities: A fine dining restaurant is available that also serves breakfast in the morning, as well as a less-formal eatery downstairs for lunch and dinner. There are a few meeting rooms, and I believe there is a fitness center as well, but don’t quote me on that. I used the fine dining restaurant for breakfast both days, and the selections there were delicious, but Dublin-priced. Very, very expensive if not included in your rate (honestly, hardly worth it).

- Room: My king bed was super comfortable, and all touch surfaces were clean. Now the door to get into the room was wonderful for purposes of blocking out sound from the hallway, but let me just say…it was HEAVY. Having to use my feet to open doors due to my disability, I actually broke one of my Crocs once while trying to get the door open. I could’ve asked for help, of course, but that would’ve been very tedious, waiting every single instance I needed to leave. I always got the door to open eventually, but maybe, just maybe, there’s a way to loosen the doors just a little bit while still preserving the soundproof quality.

As I said, the room was spotless and very cozy, but since the hotel is older, there wasn’t the same level of technology I would’ve expected at a Conrad property. It was very basic. Buttons to turn on/off the lights were simply rudimentary, and there weren’t any buttons to, for example, call housekeeping or part the curtains. If I was paying a regular summer season rate to stay here, I would need a bit more customization to the room to make it good value.

- Value: I am giving four stars with this review due to the overwhelming weight that the top-notch customer service puts on one’s experience here—positive weight. Bravo to all the personnel. But when thinking about just the rooms and atmosphere, more is needed to maintain contemporary Conrad standards of luxury. Having paid using Go Hilton, my nightly charge was half the already-low prices of the March season (even though St Patrick’s Day was super close), so I can’t complain about value too much. If I didn’t have Go Hilton and was paying 400-600 euros a night in summer, that would be way too much.

All in all, thanks to the fantastic staff for their dedication to customer care!",4,2024,03,20
209,disgusting,"Checking into the Conrad for an overnight stay with my other half, we arrived late and only went to the room after 10pm due to an event we were attending. After arriving in, we went straight to bed. 

Upon waking the next morning, we noticed a massive stain on the bed, which was undoubtably blood. This was larger than an A4 page. Reported to the receptionist prior to breakfast and was told they would get in touch to reinstate our voucher. After correspondence from being charged for mini bar items we did NOT use, the hotel made me aware there was 'no evidence indicating the hotel is at fault' 
Disgusting",2,2024,03,11
209,Perfect Stay,"Beautiful hotel, Nice decoration and excellent staffs.  I will definitely recommended to stay if you guys coming to Dublin. Very good area in Dublin 2 and near  almost to everywhere in the City. Its just a few minutes walk to St Stephen Green and The Temple Bar.",5,2024,02,23
209,Worth Considering for Overnight in Dublin,"Lovely hotel, well situated on South side of St Stephen’s Green. 
Rooms adequate, staff very friendly and helpful. Great on-site parking. 
Excellent breakfast with extensive buffet, don’t need the A La Carte. 
Short walk across the park to Graffin Street shopping",5,2024,02,17
209,A wonderful valentines stay :),"We stayed at Conrad Dublin for our anniversary and Valentines Day - we arrived early and the gents at the door insisted on helping us with our luggge.  We were greeted so warmly at reception and found our room was ready - already an amazing start to the stay.  
We were on the 6th floor and our view was lovely, the room was perfect - not a single issue or fault. 
The hotel is a perfect location for popping about Dublin and far enough out of town away from the noise for a good night sleep in the good Conrad beds.
The cocktails in the hotel were amazing and breakfast was the perfect way to start our day of exploring. 
I wanted to give a special mention to the team at Conrad - you were all so wonderful and welcoming, always with a smiley hello - a wonderful team really makes the difference.  A special mention to Shane, you know why, I won't forget your kindness and I hope to see you all again soon.",5,2024,02,16
209,Perfect location in Dublin,"The Conrad Dublin is in the perfect location for your Dublin trip.  Across the street from a beautiful park and far from the noise of the party goers, you'll love the quiet, clean atmosphere at the Conrad.  Don't skip the breakfast buffet either.  The rooms are spacious and clean.  The staff is attentive and friendly.  We will definitely be back if we are in Dublin again",5,2024,02,12
209,Not worth the money,"This hotel stands alone. It’s a ten minute walk to the centre . 
I wouldn’t recommend this hotel. Our room faced a square. We stayed in this hotel for four days and the noise from the square is horrendous. We couldn’t get no sleep one of the nights for a large group of people shouting in the square. It carried on for hours , we called reception and asked them to intervene which never happened and the group carried on. 
The hotel said it’s a public place can’t do anything. Well call the police as it disturbing the peace !! 
Offered to move rooms but who wants to move rooms in the middle of the night!!! 
Basic rooms for the price , last time in Dublin we stayed at the shelbourne hotel and we will return there. Will never stay here again",2,2024,02,10
209,"Good Location, Rooms Quite Dated","Stayed as a couple on a weekend break in the city. The hotel is located in a good position near St Stephen's Green, so readily accessible for the main shopping area and bars around Dawson Street. Staff were welcoming and the entrance area to the hotel is quite grand which provides a good first impression. The rooms however and bathrooms in particular are quite dated and the air conditioning wasn't particularly good. Carpest in the hallways were a bit stained and looked like they needed a refresh. Breakfast at the hotel was extensive and very good so worth a try. All in all if they can improve the rooms it has the potential to be a luxury hotel.",3,2024,02,05
209,Excellent customer service location all,Amazing stay. Checked in at 6am. Was able to get my room after a red eye. So appreciated. As a diamond early charge waived. Comfy beds. Excellent location. Near Temple Bar. Excellent breakfast. All a Conrad is. Dimitri in the bar made the perfect paper plane!! ,5,2024,01,11
209,Outstanding Hotel with 5* Staff and Service!,"If you're looking for an outstanding hotel experience then look no further than the Conrad Dublin! Gorgeous hotel with incredibly well-appointed rooms and superior service provided by every member of the team including the Front Desk, Le Muel's Lobby Bar, The Coburg Restaurant, the Terrace Kitchen and maid service. It's a very well run hotel offering excellence in all they do. The Conrad truly exceeded our expectations and treated us like royalty. Great location next to St. Stephen's Green and walking distance to everything. Highly recommend this Hotel, looking forward to our next visit. Big Thank you to Max, Dimitri, Matthijs, Andreje, Rachel, Tyronne, Miguel, Marzana, Levente, Sara, Iliana, Elenora and the entire team for making us feel like family!   5* All the way!!",5,2024,01,10
209,I will never stay at this hotel again.,We arrived early after an overnight flight obviously tired and jet lagged. Fortunately our room was empty and available but they would not let us into it unless we paid €100. Our alternative was to sit in the lobby for 5 hours until check in time even although our room was empty. I will never darken the door of this place again.,1,2023,12,27
209,Wonderful lasting impression,"Had an amazing stay at the Conrad in Dublin.   We had a Conrad one bedroom suite.   Was amazing to have so much space to spread out.   The bed was so comfy and the room was so quite!    Lovely sized bathroom with products by Byredo.  We enjoyed pre and after dinner drinks in Lemuels, and thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and cosy warmth.    We ate in the Terrace restaurant and the food was beautiful and well presented.   Breakfast in The Coburg was divine, right down to the Prosecco and the Bloody Marys.   A variety of fresh cooked items and eggs along with the usual buffet items.   The hotel was tastefully decorated for Christmas and a short 5 minute stroll through the park takes you to the top of Grafton Street for wonderful shopping.  Staff were very friendly and nothing was too much bother.   1st time in a Conrad but definitely will not be our last!   ",5,2023,12,20
209,Weekend in Dublin,We had a 3 night stay in the Conrad Hotel the standard of service attention to detail and we loved the Christmas vibe throughout. our room was very comfortable and breakfast each morning was exceptional. We look forward to our next visit.,5,2023,12,10
209,Dublin Conrad.. Don't Waste Your $,"I have stayed in many top hotels throughout my travel and have always loved the Conrad Hotels. We recently took a 12-day trip throughout Europe and ended our stay in Dublin at the Conrad. Sadly, this was not in any way a 5-star hotel. The carpet in the room was torn on the edge, and the bathroom had rust stains on the floor. We hoped we would be upgraded as we are Diamond members with Hilton and they put us on the first floor facing a busy street. It was not worth the money that we spent on the hotel and we were disappointed as we were looking forward to ending our trip at a luxurious hotel. Sadly this Hilton Conrad only got three (3) stars on my rating!",3,2023,11,28
209,Solid option but not best value for money,"Has the quality, cleanliness and atmosphere you would expect from a Conrad, but nothing standout. The breakfast was excellent. The bar is a little small and the service poor, worst Guinness I had on a week long trip to Ireland. 
A good solid option especially if you are staying using points, but feel for the price there could be more luxurious option in the great city of Dublin. 
Also although pet friendly not great facilities for walking once the nearby park has closed in the evening!",4,2023,11,17
209,A wonderful experience!,"Enjoyed 3 nights here over a weekend. The hotel is well located near St. Stephen’s Green, easy walk to Pearce Station, restaurants, shopping and most everything we could have wanted. The staff and service are exceptionally attentive, polite and responsive. Breakfast in the restaurant and a late night casual dinner in the Terrace restaurant were great. It’s a splurge, but they deliver the value and we’ll be back!",5,2023,10,26
209,Distinctly underwhelming,"Compared to many Conrad's we've stayed in, this was probably the most basic. No Diamond upgrade offered at check-in, no lounge, a few housekeeping issues like empty shower gel (these area large bottles so it must have not been checked for weeks), staff getting our surname wrong, breakfast items running out when it was busy. One expects better from a premium brand. After highlighting these XD issues the front desk did upgrade us to a junior suite for our final night which was much appreciated.",3,2023,10,25
209,4-star hotel at best!,"We stayed at this hotel for our last night in Ireland on a family vacation.  Immediately was not impressed.  The hallways were old looking and rooms needed some updating.  We booked adjoining rooms which the hotel did accommodate.  My room had hair all over the bathroom floor, sink, and shower.  I asked housekeeping to clean again which they did.  However later that night I found the items on the minibar had a thick layer of dust on them and the items in the fridge were shoved in there like someone’s personal fridge.  The minibar in the other room was dusty but fridge was put together.  And probably the worse part was when I went to use the hotel slippers they had been used!! So gross!! At least one of these two rooms had not been cleaned in a long time!!  For all the hype surrounding this hotel and the VERY pretentious vibe you feel immediately after entering the building I was NOT impressed.  Do not expect a 5-star hotel.  I would say 4-star on their best day!!",3,2023,10,24
209,Wonderful Staff; Facilities and Food Need Improvement,Example of facilities issues: one elevator was out of order the 4 nights we were there and the shower on our third floor suite was very weak and made a high pitched sound when it was running. The breakfast buffet had the worse scones and breads we had in our 10 days in Ireland. The 50 Euro shot of whiskey was overpriced as the bottle cost only 95 Euro. The menu in the Terrace restaurant  was very limited. The woman who cleaned our suite kept coughing and we told her that she needed to wear a mask and she did not.,2,2023,10,14
209,Incredible stay in Dublin,"I booked a last minute weekend in after a week of work in London and decided to treat myself to a nice hotel stay. The Conrad did not disappoint! The whole hotel is so classy and beautiful. The room was large and had all the amenities. I appreciated the daily bottled water, the selection of tea and coffee, and the robes and slippers. The bed was very comfortable as well. 

The service everywhere was impeccable. I enjoyed chatting with the staff at the bar, David and Dimitri were so lovely and they made some crafty drinks. Breakfast was delicious. The front desk arranged a taxi for me when I left and loaded the luggage in while I had breakfast. 

The location is very convenient, keep in mind it is about a 20 min walk to the river and the Temple Bar area if that's your scene, I didn't mind but there is also a convenient bus stop right outside the hotel. I will absolutely be back!",5,2023,10,09
209,"Great Hotel, except for the stain on the bedsheet!","On October 4th, 2023, my wife and I checked into the Conrad Dublin and received our room shortly thereafter.  The lobby area and reception staff were amazing.  The decor is modern and very impressive.  We were very happy we chose this hotel for our 4 night stay.  We were assigned room #217 and again, we were very happy with our room size and the amenities included in our rate.  Again, we were very impressed with everything at this point, 10 out of 10. 

Once in the room, my wife began to unpack our suitcases and we decide to go down to the bar to have a couple of drinks and an appetizer.  This took about 45 minutes  Once at the bar, we hung out for about an hour and upon our return, the room was “turned-down”.  Chocolates were placed on the nightstand, the curtains were drawn shut and each side of the duvet cover was slightly folded back into a triangle shape.  My wife went to pull the duvet cover back on her side of the bed and she immediately noticed a brown smear/mark/stain on the bedsheet on her side near the edge of the bed.  She told me what she saw and asked me to look at the smear/mark/stain.  Neither one of us had pulled the duvet back before we left to the bar and this was the first time we observed any portion of the bedsheet, as the duvet covered the entire bedsheet area before we left to the bar. 

I had no idea what this smear/mark/stain was as my wife and looked at each other in total disbelief.  Now my curiosity got the best of me and I decided take an even closer look and it appeared to possibly be smeared and dried up feces.  This was later confirmed.  I knew there was no possible way neither my wife or I had left this smear/mark/stain because neither of us had pulled the duvet covers back before we went to the bar.  We also checked our shoes and clothes to ensure there was 100% no possibility we did this.  

We then decided to call the front desk and inform them of what we found  The lady at the front desk seemed shocked by our find and within 5 minutes, two housecleaning staff respond to our room.  The two staff members appeared a little shocked when I opened the door and showed them the smear/mark/stain.  I then sat on the couch as the staff spoke in Spanish.  I saw them look at the smear/mark/stain and one them said “cocoa” and then nodded her head. I then said “ca-ca”.  They both giggled and asked me if I spoke Spanish.  I told them I didn’t but this was clearly feces and they agreed.  The sheet and duvet cover were quickly changed and they both profusely apologized for the incident several times.  I told then it was not their fault and they eventually left the room.  I did not hear from any Management during this incident.

The next morning, my wife and I had breakfast and we prepared to go sightseeing for the day (around 11am).  I still had not heard from any of the hotel Management, so I decided to stop by the reception desk on our way out and ask one of the female staff members if someone from Management would contact us about what happened the night before.  The female ensured me that someone from Management would contact me.  

My wife and I then went and enjoyed our late morning and afternoon sightseeing and returned to to our room around 7pm.  The cleaning staff was almost done with our turn-down service and they left shorty thereafter.  As I was int he bathroom, the Assistant Front of House Manager, Nikolaos Voukelatos, called our room phone and my wife answered.  Nikolaos  asked my wife if we received the complimentary chocolates during this evening’s turn-down service.  My wife asked Nikolaos what was he talking about and he then stated the chocolates were for the stain that was on the couch.  My wife said Nikolaos spoke so quickly that she didn’t completely understand what he was saying but she corrected him and stated the smear/mark/stain was on the bed and not on the couch and it was a “poop stain”.  Nikolaos then said the stain was from an iron and not from feces.  My wife corrected Nikolaos and stated I would call him when I returned from the bathroom.  Nikolaos continually denied the smear/mark/stain was feces and stated to my wife, “That doesn’t ever happen here, that was an iron mark.”

I called Nikolaos  a few moments later and he informed me he was checking to see if we received the complimentary chocolates.  I explained to Nikolaos  the smear/mark/stain was not from an iron but it was feces.  Nikolaos  began to debate with me the origin of the stain and I informed him that the cleaning staff and I both conformed it was feces.  Nikolaos  asked me if I wanted an investigation into this matter and I asked him how did he come up with the smear/mark/stain being made from an iron.  Nikolaos stated he viewed a picture of the smear/mark/stain from one of the cleaning staff and he and the cleaning staff determined it was from an iron.  I explained how I determined it was feces and again, he asked me if I wanted an investigation into the matter.  I informed Nikolaos it didn’t matter at this point and I was offended that he did not have accurate information and concluded himself that the smear/mark/stain was from an iron, especially since the cleaning staff agreed the smear/mark/stain was feces also.  Nikolaos stated he would provide me with some complimentary cocktails and I told him I didn’t want anything complimentary, I just wanted him and his staff to have accurate information about this situation and not “chaulk it up” to an iron stain when it was fecal matter on the bedsheet.  Nikolaos continued to speak a million miles an hour and I asked him for his supervisor. Nikolaos informed me he was the current supervisor and he continued to speak in a demeaning tone and appeared to want to quickly get off the phone with me.  Nikolaos continually asked me if there was anything else he could do for me, in what I felt was a very condescending manner and tone.  

The next morning, after breakfast, I went to the front reception desk and asked to speak to a Manager.  A short time later, Alex introduced himself to me and we went to another area to speak.  Alex was the consummate professional and he listened to the incident from the beginning to the end.  Again, Alex was a true professional and I appreciate him listening to me.  

The next day, I was in the lobby and I heard Nikolaos speaking to another guest on the phone. As Nikolaos was speaking fast, he told the guests they were “misinformed” several times and repeatadly asked if there was anything else he could do for the person on the other side on the phone.  This conversation Nikolaos was having with this guest reminded me of the same speed, tone and condescending manner he spoke to me.  Nikolaus has no business talking to guests the way he does and Management needs to seriously consider retraining him on how to properly deal with guests.  

Businesses are run by the reactions to problems that guests bring to the staffs attention.  I do not expect the entire hotel to be held accountable for what the previous guest did before our arrival.  Was there a failure by the staff that cleaned the room prior to our arrival, yes, but when a guest points out a problem (especially feces on a sheet), Management should address the issue immediately and not a day or two later.  And then when this is delegated, have someone that can professionally address the situation and never come off as condescending or rude.  This was a complete failure by the Conrad Dublin Management and I have a feeling Management at this location can understand my frustration. The follow-up for this situation was 100% unacceptable and I believe the Conrad Dublin Management would agree.  

The rest of our visit was great but this one incident obviously affected our entire stay.",2,2023,10,07
209,Top Notch Staff and Service,"My husband and I were on a 2 week trip to Europe Aug. 26-Sept. 9 and added 4 days in Dublin to our itinerary.
Let me start by saying ""we are usually Marriott people"" but I got a good package from Amex for the Conrad and based on our kids rave reviews at other Conrads, decided to try it over the Westin.  
From the moment we arrived, the staff was wonderful. Marie at the front desk greeted us and made sure we knew all our amenities and offers. Shayla (sp?) was our server our 1st morning at breakfast, and then made sure she greeted us our next 2 mornings...;and then introduced us to Teresa who served us the next 2 days.  They would give the barista ideas of our activities for the day and the barista would incorporate it into the art on my cappucino (which was among the best cappucino of our whole trip).
We will definitely be coming back to Ireland and will stay at the Conrad. Your staff made our trip incredibly memorable.",5,2023,10,04
209,Great Location and Beautiful Hotel,"The staff was very gracious and welcoming to their hotel.  Our room was lovely with comfortable beds and plenty of space.  We loved the morning breakfast option....so much food and the presentation was excellent.  Any amenity you would need was in the room or I assume could be asked for.  We stayed for 3 nights and found the location terrific for walking pretty much anywhere in the Dublin tourist area.  We walked to Guinness Storehouse, the Temple Bar area, the Ha'Penny Bridge, Trinity College etc.  The St. Stephen's Green across the street was lovely, as was the row of colorful doors on the outside road of the park.  I would definitely stay here again if back in Dublin.  ",5,2023,10,02
209,Fantastic service hindered by old rooms.,"I would like to express my thanks to all the wonderful staffs at Conrad Dublin. It is a pity that their great service is undermined by the poor room condition and the ridiculous price Hilton charges. 

I booked a 2- night stay at Conrad Dublin. Upon arrival, I received early-check-in as part of AMEX FHR benefit.  Although I didn't receive any upgrades for FHR or my Hilton status, I was happy trading that with early check-in. The staff at the front desk and restaurant are sweet and very helpful. Were it not for their top-notch service, this review would have been a 1-star review.

There comes the not so good part: the rooms are ultra outdated, probably have not been renovated in the last 20 years. Thin, single pane glass is used for all the windows which provide very poor noise insulation.  The toilet is from the 90s with its seat and lid about to fall off. I also found many flies in the room, which was a very unpleasant experience. Overall, the condition of the rooms is worse than those you will find in Holiday Inn, and the fact Hilton charges 550 euro per night is unacceptable (which is more expensive than true 5-star hotels in Dublin such as the Merrion). Frankly, the rooms are unworthy of AMEX FHR program.

If you can secure a good price at this property, i.e. less than 300 euros per night, maybe it is worth it. However, if you are looking for a true 5-star hotel, you would be better off booking elsewhere. ",4,2023,09,27
209,Beware,"Sent a complaint originally on 22nd August 2023 and still no formal response. I note it took around 2.5-3 weeks to receive our refund and that’s after a follow up call to which we were promised a formal response. They never even bothered to update me on a delay etc on the refund. Clearly don’t care. No formal response or apology received despite this being promised over the phone. If @Conrad respond to this looking for more detail I HAVE SENT SEVERAL EMAILS AND STILL NO RESPONSE! Summary of original complaint below:
I would like to address several issues that significantly marred our stay and fell far short of the expectations we had for a 5-star establishment of your caliber.
1.Miscommunication Regarding Voucher Acceptance: Prior to our visit, we contacted your hotel to inquire about the acceptance of a voucher we received as a wedding gift. We were assured that the voucher was indeed accepted, and we were looking forward to using it as part of our stay. I have attached the email thread for your reference. Moreover, the voucher provider's website clearly lists the Conrad Dublin as a participating property.
2.Process and Delayed Room Availability: Upon our arrival, we were informed that a €100 deposit was required for our room. We were willing to comply, but after presenting our voucher and discussing the matter, the staff member assured us that the deposit would not be charged immediately. Despite this assurance, the full amount, along with the deposit, was withdrawn from my account immediately but I was told it was just ""a hold”. Additionally, we were informed that our room was not yet ready for check-in, despite your website's stated check-in time of 3:00 PM. This delay in providing the room added to our dissatisfaction (was quite a large delay!)
3.Unfulfilled Promises and Lack of Attention to Detail, Including Pet Facilities: We were particularly disheartened by the inadequate attention given to the arrangements for our pet. Prior to our arrival, we were informed over the phone that accommodations would be made for our dog, including a dog bed, bowl, and treats. However, upon checking into our room after a late and delayed check-in due to the unavailability of our room, we were disheartened to find that none of the promised facilities for our dog were provided. We immediately brought this oversight to the attention of your staff, and we were assured that the matter would be rectified while we were away for dinner. Despite this assurance, upon our return, we were dismayed to discover that the facilities for our dog were still absent. The lack of follow-through on such a basic request for a pet-friendly room contradicted the standards one would expect from a luxury establishment.
4.Hygiene and Cleanliness Issues: Upon entering our room, we were dismayed to find that the iPhone speakers by the bed were covered in dust, and some of the glasses provided were marred with mould. Such hygiene and cleanliness concerns are entirely unacceptable for a hotel of your stature.
5.Incompetent Billing and Overcharging: Our dissatisfaction with the stay was further compounded during the check-out process. Despite reminding your staff repeatedly and providing the voucher details, we were left waiting as the matter was discussed amongst your team. Following this extended wait, we were informed that our voucher had not been seen before, and a charge of almost €400 was mistakenly processed through my bank account. This error was deeply distressing, as not only were the funds earmarked for our anniversary celebration wrongly withdrawn, but we were also informed that it might take 5 to 10 business days for a refund to be processed. To add to our frustration, moments earlier, we were assured by your staff that no immediate charge would be placed on my card. The subsequent explanation that the charge had been processed accidentally by a staff member was disconcerting and reflected a lack of professionalism and attention to detail.",1,2023,09,26
209,It’s nice to be back.,Stayed here @ 5 years ago and it was great so I returned for a night before flying back to DC. Minor room issue professionally resolved by Front Desk manager.  Lovely drinks @ bar and a very nice breakfast.  I was drinking so I couldn’t enjoy the complimentary Bloody Mary & Mimosas.  Love the nightly turndown service.  I’ll be back!,5,2023,09,25
209,Overall Great Stay,"Stayed here for a week on holiday with family.  Hotel was very accommodating.  Concierge made advance arrangements for us for transportation, tours, and afternoon tea.  Was disappointed that our rooms were not ready upon our arrival at hotel in early afternoon since hotel knew of our approximate arrival time.  Still, front desk was very pleasant and rooms were great.  Hotel has two elevators and one was undergoing maintenance the entire week.  The working elevator could not keep up with guest needs, but from the noises it made one could understand why elevator maintenance was needed.  Food at hotel is excellent, from breakfast buffet, through afternoon tea and dinner.  We experienced one staff member that seemed to give special attention to every table but ours at breakfast, but we worked around her.  Lucia was terrific in the mornings as was staff at afternoon tea.  All were very accommodating about food allergies in my family.  The Conrad Dublin is not a sparkly high rise like some other Conrad hotels, but it is very nice and well run. ",5,2023,09,19
209,Definitely one of Dublin’s top hotels.,"We stayed here for the weekend having arranged tickets for a Brad Mehldau performance in the Concert Hall across the street on one of the nights. 

We were upgraded from Superior to Deluxe on the top floor.  Room was lovely, comfortable  and well sound insulated. 

The hotel is looking very well after recent refit. Particularly the reception, bar and downstairs Terrace restaurant. 

Breakfast was really very good. 

This reclaims it’s place as one of Dublin’s top hotels. Will return again and again.",5,2023,09,18
209,Amazing level of service in a beautiful hotel,"Hotel is lovely, room comfortable and spacious, and the breakfast is delicious. More importantly the staff goes above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. Like a total space cadet, I left my raincoat behind accidental (of all things to leave behind in Ireland SMH) and they arranged its return to me!! I am absolutely blown away by this kindness. Highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a place that will treat you like royalty. Thank you Conrad Dublin.",5,2023,09,14
209,Not a five star...,"The Hotel fell well below our experience for a 5 Star hotel and we have stayed in many of them. I am surprised it was listed as a Conrad. The rooms are on the small side (King Premiere). Our visit occurred during an unseasonably warm time (all of 24 C ???). The air conditioning in the rooms was terrible. It was cooler outside than in the rooms (we had two rooms on different floors and had the same experience). One of the two guest elevators was out of service during our entire visit. The staff was warm and friendly, but that does not make for a 5 star rating. Missing a lot the little things..No doorman was around to open the main door (each the 12 times), no porters in sight to assist with the luggage, no night lighting in the bathroom. We must have also missed the spa and pool as well. My expectations were just too high after I saw the 5 start rating. I was expecting  more on par to our recent stays at the  Ritz Carlton in Boston and the Four Seasons in Santa Fe.",3,2023,09,10
209,Near enough perfect,"Fantastic welcome when checking in on Friday morning, helpful friendly and attentive.

Room was great have to say bathroom facilities were excellent especially the quality of towels really impressed 

Location is great short walk to St Stephens.

Breakfast was spot on Gemma was incredibly helpful and top service.

Only disappointment the hotel bar, food ok but poorly cooked chips and a dreadful spicy margarita which was sent back and still very poor. And even staff agreed 

House keeping was of a good standard 
All in all some fantastic service great hotel hotel bar needs work",4,2023,09,10
209,Lovely stay,"Really like the Conrad. Room was comfortable, great shower. Breakfast was really excellent- huge range , great food. Enjoyed drinks in lemuels. Only mild negative was lack of sound proofing. I was woken at 7am every morning as other guests banged their doors shut.",4,2023,09,07
209,Conrad is a hit again ,"I am a real fan of the Conrad brand, this did not disappoint. 

Hotel has a great location close to Stephens Green.  Rooms are older but very serviceable. Communal areas are nice.

Where the Conrad Dublin shines is service, nothing is to much trouble. 

Breakfast was excellent. 

The hotel is not inexpensive, but is worth it all round. 

Will stay again! ",5,2023,09,03
209,Wonderful first trip to Dublin,"Thank you so much for a wonderful relaxing stay.  Comfy, pillows and dreamy beds.  Lovely cocktails and great range of whiskeys in the bar.  The food in the Terrace restaurant was delicious and a bit shout out to Melanie and all the staff for looking after us so beautifully.  The house keeping and breakfast staff also deserve a special mention for being so cheery and sunny…great job guys - loved it! 😁",5,2023,09,01
209,Loved the location and the staff,"This hotel was great! We actually had to switch to a different hotel later in the week because of a tour package we had booked, and we missed the luxuriousness of the Conrad. The staff was great and the room was very nice. The best part is the location. It's very close to St. Stephen's Green and tucked away from hustle and bustle of the city.  ",5,2023,08,30
209,Rip off taking advantage of good customers,"The hotel charge us 3 times the normal rate for our stay. $2350 euro for a very small room. Ok you are busy but come on with the 
Greed, greed, We Thought the rate was for our 3 nights. Great way to loss good customers by taking advantage of them. The room also had a sink that took along time to drain. The staff was great but no more hiltons for us.",1,2023,08,30
209,Great location,"The hotel is nice, very convenient location to all the attractions.  The best French toast I ever had.  The shower has great pressure.  The bed was a little hard for me.  I think all the rooms are pretty good. Nthey do have free Wi-Fi.",4,2023,08,29
209,Top location and high end service,"It's a good hotel, certainly on the pricey high end for Dublin, but I can't help feel it wasn't as grand as other Conrads I've visited.  I enjoyed the large room and large breakfast buffet spread (included as  Diamond), but the restaurant dinner and late night menus felt limited, perhaps that was from the executive chef trying out a new style during my visit.  

The location is excellent, on the other side of St. Stephen's Green is historic  Grafton Street and all your shopping and dining needs.  1 km away is Trinity College and along the way are 4 major museums.  You can wander your way across the River Liffey without exhausting yourself, and the bus system can get you wherever else you might want to go, even to the airport or main train station.",4,2023,08,24
209,A gorgeous centrally located hotel with the best staff,"The Conrad is one of the best hotels I have had the pleasure of staying in. I visited with my partner and stayed for 3 nights. The staff were so accommodating and lovely, making you feel welcome the moment you step foot through the door. They have these cute little chocolates on display in reception for guests and they were a really sweet (excuse the pun) touch. The continental breakfast was gorgeous and everything tasted amazing. The entire hotel was spotless but still felt homely. The hotel is really centrally located to which was perfect as we walked everywhere. Thank you for a gorgeous stay - We will be back!",5,2023,08,21
209,Wonderful hotel ,"Really outstanding hotel staff, so very nice.  Wonderful hotel with the best breakfast anywhere!
Great location next to St. Stephen's Green.  Lovely rooms with every thoughtful amenity.   Highly recommend!",5,2023,08,15
209,Needs a bit more shine but location is great,"Hmmm, this hotel is situated in a perfect location for downtown. Most of the stay was great, but it lacked that little extra oomph in a 5 star hotel you are looking for.  The cleaning staff was 5/5 and did the sparkling for this hotel.  The restaurant staff is really
Trying very hard, they are all practicing English.  The front desk, and concierge just seemed indifferent most days. The fitness center was fantastic and I truly enjoyed it.",4,2023,08,09
209,Overrated,"I have had the pleasure of saying that Conrad hotels around the world this is not the worst but it's pretty close.

I look at things in a perspective The Conrad brand is an upper luxury brand in the Hilton family.  This hotel reminded me of a really good Hilton Hotel but it did not go that next step.

I found the lack of facilities quite shocking the lack of any type of executive lounge, The lack of a full service bar because when I was there I wasn't able to get a cocktail at 2:00 p.m. because they didn't have a bartender. 

The rooms themselves have been renovated but it's the classic lipstick on a pig Small cramped old school bathrooms My bathroom in particular the shower didn't drain the sink didn't drain. The tool that you needed to flush a few times for it to work properly.

Also my interaction with the staff was hit or miss. When attempting to check out the lobby was full of people with only one person working the front desk.

The hotel also had construction at the front entrance when I was a guest which led to some minor inconvenience as I was driving to arrive at this hotel and just wanted to drop off my baggage before returning the rental car a few blocks down the street there was no way to park in front of the hotel because the driveway was blocked there was no doorman around to direct where we could stop the car and unload the baggage. 

The price even for Dublin is ridiculous You can find much better quality hotels for an equal or lesser price.

In my opinion the Conrad name should be removed and it should be replaced with DoubleTree or Hilton because that's actually with this property iswith this property is",2,2023,07,29
209,Excellent stay for 7 nights,"This was a vacation. Rooms were excellent size, housekeeping was always done before noon which I love. bar area was intimate and young Sara made it work. A couple of things. Concierge service needs to be more robust. Bath tubs need a mat, they are a danger. One elevator was out for 5 days which is way too long. Leyre is guest relations is a gem.",4,2023,07,28
209,Great Experience,"Enjoyed my stay--room are quiet, clean and comfortable.   The hotel location is walking distance to most attractions yet slightly off the busy section which I liked.   The staff make the hotel special--everyone was very welcoming, extremely friendly and helpful.     Definitely would return on any trip to Dublin.",5,2023,07,13
209,Good hotel but not 5 star,We booked our room thru Amex travel with Amex Platinum card (prepaid) thus we received one free night when booking for 4 nights plus we received daily breakfast too. A very good deal as this hotel is not cheap. Breakfast was okay. I will not buy it if it's not included especially for the rate they charge.  The egg benedicts that we got one morning were already cold. Also the buffet selection was just okay. The room was okay too. I wouldn't categorize this Conrad as a 5 star hotel. It's a 4 star at the maximum. I've stayed at many 5 star hotels before and they were not like this hotel. The location was good. Walking distance to Grafton street for shopping and food. Close to the park where you can purchase hop on and off city tour. ,4,2023,07,11
209,Best service ever.,"The rooms were modern and roomy.
The breakfast was excellent.
The staff were outstanding, the best encountered.
They were the most helpful, friendliest and efficient, I cannot say enough how good they were.
From check in to breakfast staff and including the cleaners. 6 stars guys and gals.
I would recommend this hotel to everyone.
It is also very conveniently located.
They chocolates are a big hit too.",5,2023,07,09
209,Amazing Stay ,"Stayed at The Conrad recently for a weekend away in Dublin and it was superb. The room was very spacious and comfortable, breakfast was delicious and the location was great. Would definitely recommend, we will be back! ",5,2023,07,07
209,5 stars for the Conrad Dublin ,"Great location and lovely decor. The bedrooms are modern and fresh with a lovely welcome from the desk. 
We had lunch and dinner in the terrace restaurant and it was lovely. Breakfast was also great with a lovely buffet! We have been to a number of lovely Conrad’s around and this defintely is up there. ",5,2023,07,07
209,Great stay,"Centrally located, great service, clean and definitely worth a stay.  This is the second Conrad I’ve stayed in and they certainly have lived up to the expectations of providing world class service. Would highly recommend.  Finally made 200 characters, yea!",5,2023,07,06
209,"Beautiful hotel, great location!","Great hotel!  I arrived quite early in the day- 9:30am, so my room wasn’t ready, but the front desk staff took my bags and offered me complimentary breakfast since I and a Diamond member. They normally don’t offer breakfast on the first day, and after 18 hours of travel, it was so very welcome!!  The hotel is situated about a block from St Stephen’s Green, which is gorgeous. The hop-on/off busses pick up on the far side of the Green, about 1/4km from the hotel, which is very convenient. I ate in the bar and the Terrace Kitchen- both excellent!!  There were two negatives to staying here. The bathtub was tall/deep, and I’m a bit clumsy, so I was very worried about getting in/out. If you have any mobility issues, you need to make them aware. Also, the bed was a bit firm for my taste. But that’s just preference. 

Diamond benefits- free breakfast, which includes the fabulous buffet and/or something off the menu, as well as a €15 credit, which I used in the bar.",5,2023,07,05
209,Conrad Dublin--Great Hotel!,"What a beautiful hotel!  The rooms were very nice, the lobby was decorated with some fantastic floral arrangements.  Breakfast was yummy.  All the staff were very friendly and helpful.  The location is very close to St. Stephen's Green.",5,2023,06,26
209,Beautiful Hotel But Unfriendly Staff!!!,"My wife and I stayed here for a weekend in Dublin and after paying almost €800 we found that this hotel was not worth the money.

The hotel is beautiful, it is well appointed and looks and feels 5* in every way. It has these positives going for it.

However the staff are so unfriendly, unhelpful and apathetic. For the price paid you would expect some level of friendly treatment.

The reception staff acted like they were going through the motions and really couldn’t be bothered. Reception also forgot to book our taxi to Heuston Station and we had to ask for it to be done again. No apology offered. 

The housekeeping staff entered twice one morning before we went down to breakfast. I would have thought they would know if guests are staying in a room or not. 

Breakfast was the worst though. The lady managing breakfast told us to sit in the outer annexe room as there were no tables in the breakfast room. The area was really dark and we asked to be seated in the main restaurant. She shrugged her shoulders and sighed as she brought us in there where we saw multiple tables free. We couldn’t understand why. We had to remind the staff on both mornings about tea and toast as they forgot on both mornings and just seemed totally disinterested. 

No one actually wears a name badge at this hotel or they never gave their names either. It’s a bit unusual for a hotel I thought. It would have been good to see the badges as it might have been better way to identify a manager so as to leave feedback. Although in hindsight, judging by the staff attitude I would doubt management is any better. 

There are plenty better 5* hotels nearby in the Stephens Green area and we will take a punt on them next time as I’m sure their staff are better than the Conrad. We won’t be back. Don’t waste your money where it isn’t wanted.",2,2023,06,24
209,Excellent Hotel,"The staff at the Hotel Conrad are top notch. Everyone was friendly and accommodating. We were allowed to check in early, which was appreciated after an overnight flight. The front desk made good recommendations for meals and activities. The breakfast was excellent. Rooms are clean and comfortable. We were very happy with our choice and would stay again!",5,2023,06,20
209,Luxury stay in Dublin,"“One of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed in.”  That’s a direct quote from my husband about our stay at the Conrad Dublin. The rooms were well appointed, with comfortable beds and great toiletries. While the hotel smelled great (which helps set the mood when you walk into the hotel) and the breakfast was truly good (I ate my weight in pork sausages) and there were tasty cocktails and snacks at the restaurants, the staff is what took this stay to the next level. Everyone was truly kind and thoughtful and made us feel like true guests and not just people staying at a hotel.  Gemma and Caroline were truly delightful. 

The hotel is close to many sights and great restaurants (15 minutes to the Book of Kells and museums and 15 minutes to Temple Bar), but in a quieter part of town which we appreciated. The 700 bus is also a quick 5 minute walk and an easy and efficient way to get into town. 

We will definitely be returning and will be planning on staying here again.",5,2023,06,19
209,WOW! what a treat. ,This hotel is stunning. Although a bit on the pricey side it is completely worth it for a special occasion. We were well and truly looked after and I was very happy with what the hotel had to offer. Rooms are stunning and the food and drink was next level amazing. This was definitely worth the treat!,5,2023,06,09
209,40th Wedding Anniversary at a Fabulous Hotel,"Where to start... We began and ended our 2-week trip at the Conrad.  Every staff member was attentive, kind and welcoming.  We had two different style rooms.  The first night was an executive king which was ready when we arrived early in the day from our overnight flight.  Crisp sheets, fluffy pillows and a fabulous bath tub.  We utilized the bar that night for a quick bit and drink.  Super pleasant and did the trick.  On our second stay at the end of the trip, the staff went above and beyond to help us celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary.  We were upgraded to a Jr. Suite with a balcony.  (I'm also a diamond Hilton member).  We were greeted with treats, a bottle of Prosecco and adorable towel art.   We also felt further appreciated by the kind notes from the management team.  We were very grateful for the larger room since we spent two nights with the Conrad.  Just a beautiful way to end our fabulous trip to Ireland.  (additionally there is a car rental Sixt, right inside the Conrad.  Easy pick-up of the car and it allows you to get a rest before you start driving).",5,2023,05,31
209,Lap of luxury at its very best,"I had the most amazing stay at The Conrad Dublin. I'm a very experienced traveller and everything there was just perfect, the staff are providing a personal and amazing service, the beds are like sleeping on a cloud, the showers are the most comfortable I've ever experienced. Finally, the breakfast is just fantastic and Suzie who is responsible for the buffet is the most service minded person ever. The Conrad is the only place I want to stay at when coming back to Dublin next time. Has to be experienced, home away from home at its best! ",5,2023,05,20
209,Beautiful Hotel Great Stay!!,"The Conrad Hotel was our last stop in a 10-day vacation traveling around Southern Ireland. We had stayed in non Hilton hotels in other cities which were all wonderful, but we were looking forward to our stay in The Conrad as we are very loyal Hilton patrons and Diamond members. This hotel is just beautiful. We were made to feel welcome immediately upon arrival, and were provided with an upgrade to a spotless, and comfortable deluxe king room. The accommodations in the room were excellent - very comfortable bed, hair dryer, coffee maker, robes, slippers and plenty of big, soft towels. The shower was hot (which I love) with great water pressure. The turn down service was an added bonus, and the hotel went out of its way to honor our anniversary with a bottle of champagne and chocolate, as well as a nice note. This was so very appreciated. The breakfast was delicious with many hot and cold options and the service by the whole staff was impeccable, most notably, Judy who was lovely and attentive. We had an unexpected glitch where reception did not mark us as having arrived so we were charged almost $400 as a no show fee. When I went to the Front Desk to sort this out, they promptly rectified the error and were most apologetic. Overall, we had a wonderful stay and would definitely choose this hotel again when visiting Dublin! ",5,2023,05,14
209,Perfect location,"We were extremely satisfied with this hotel. The atmosphere, service, amenities, and quality were excellent. The breakfast menu has many options and the food is excellent. The Terrace Kitchen was also very good for dinner.
 ",5,2023,05,06
209,Worst hospitality!! Never again!,"
My husband and I stayed at the Conrad from May 2-3 and I can say that we were treated with disrespect by the assistant front of house manager Alexandre Leung at the reception. 
We have always heard the best about the Conrad Hotel however our experience was extremely disappointing because of the rude treatment by this receptionist. 
His hospitality skills were unacceptable for the reputation of the Conrad. 
We paid almost 500€ per night and expected to be treated much better. 
We wanted to speak to the manager but he wouldn’t let us speak to them. 
This experience almost ruined our stay in Ireland and my husband doesn’t want to come back to Ireland anymore because of how offended he feels.
We feel that this review was necessary as the Conrad should not employ such employees at the front house (maybe in the back would be better as not to offend anyone). ",1,2023,05,03
209,Excellent,"Excellent hotel in very way:
- friendly, professional and helpful staff
- clean, well appointed rooms with comfy beds, good WiFi, tv, and plenty of amenities
 - perfect location, near St Stephens Green, shopping, restaurants and pubs
- the best thing is the outstanding breakfast - very attentive staff, with many options from the buffet to the made-to-order omelettes. I especially appreciated the many gluten and dairy free items.",5,2023,05,03
209,Good location,The location was perfect for us and so easy to access to the express bus station from\to Dublin International Airport also major sightseeing areas. The staffs were so nice however the breakfast could have been better. The complementary menus were so basic and they charged us anything extra. ,4,2023,04,30
209,Not a five-star hotel.,"This hotel falls far below the standard of a Conrad property or a five-star hotel. At best the rooms and service are reminiscent of a Sheraton, circa 1993. Yes, it had a Nespresso machine, but that is not what makes a room a five-star room. The beds were hard and only had feather pillows (despite requesting a non-feather pillow, they brought up another feather pillow). The bathroom had flickering fluorescent lights and a bathtub shower that was so tall that it was difficult for my elderly mother to get in and out of. The drapes were dour and looked like something out of an old country estate. 

The hotel only has two elevators and one was out of order for our entire four-day stay. It made getting anywhere during peak times quite difficult and unpleasant. 

Upon arrival (around 5:00pm) we were put into a room with a connecting room - as soon as I saw that I called the front desk and said that that was unacceptable. The gentleman I spoke to said he'd call back in 10 min with a solution, but didn't call back for more than 20 min. The solution was another connecting room. I told him to try again. He called back another 20+ minutes later and said he found a room, but that it would need to be serviced by housekeeping and wouldn't be ready for nearly an hour. Not wanting to sit around waiting, we decided to get dinner at The Terrace down on the lower level of the hotel. I was told that they would contact me via text or email to let me know when the room was ready, but no one ever reached out. After a two-hour dinner I had to go to the front desk to find out what was going on. I've experienced better service at 3-star airport hotels. 

Just after booking the our stay, I reached out to the concierge for help arranging a daytrip and no one ever got back to me. But they did manage to send an email encouraging me to spend even more money to upgrade my room. 

The one upside to the hotel was the dining options and restaurant staff. We mostly ate at The Terrace and the food was great and the staff was very friendly and on-top of things. The breakfast buffet at the Anna Haugh restaurant was a great option and again, the staff was great. We ordered room service one night - the menu is the same as The Terrace - and again, the food was great and the gentleman who brought our food up was more than pleasant. But it's pretty sad when the only kind thing you can say about a so-called five-star hotel is that its restaurants are great. 

After spending ten days at a Hyatt Regency in another city, this was a massive let-down. The Conrad Dublin didn't even come close to the level of luxury or attention to detail that that hotel offered - and Conrad is supposed to be among the most luxurious brands in the Hilton portfolio. 

I would strongly recommend avoiding this hotel if you're actually looking for a five-star (or even a four-star) experience. ",2,2023,04,30
209,Wonderful time in Dublin,"Well this was truly a wonderful experience at the Conrad dublin, we arrived very early and was able to check in! The French gentleman at the reception and the Sri Lankan bellman were very accommodating and kind! Rory at the concierge was very helpful! We will be back.",5,2023,04,30
209,A wonderful Anniversary getaway!,"Thank you for looking after us so well on our short visit to Dublin!!! We had a wonderful time in the hotel and we were very well cared for by Leyre who let us know all of the exciting things to see and places to eat around the Hotel.

Tim from Reception was so kind and made our entry and exit from the hotel so easy! And Mary from the restaurant made us feel so welcome and looked after.

All the staff did such a great job working over a period that I imagine must have been busy and difficult for them during the Visit of President Joe Biden with all the extra security measures that had been put in place.

Thank you very much and we will definitely be staying again!!!

Jack and Princess",5,2023,04,27
209,Hotel is outdated and needs renovation,"Guest rooms are overdue for renovation.
Power outlets except for USB ports in the room did not work.
Outdated toilet and shower room with paint peeling off.
Out of 2 elevators, one was permanently in service and had to wait for some extended period of times to go up/down.
Windows in the room do not block any noise and felt like they were open even though they were shut.
Have been to many Conrad hotels but this one does not meet the expectation level of Conrad!

209,Best hotel in Dublin,"This is an excellent hotel in a great location. The bed and desk were very comfortable. Spotlessly clean. I was tired when I arrived and ordered room service, it came up quickly and was the best burger I’ve had in a long time! I went for a run one morning and was offered a bottle of water as soon as I walked back in, very attentive and friendly staff. It was really helpful to have laundry service on site and my shirts were sent back perfectly pressed. This will be my first choice the next time I’m staying in Dublin.",5,2023,04,25
209,Conrad Dublin for the Win!,Very nice hotel in a great location in Dublin. Restaurants were good and the staff was great. My wife liked how comfortable the bed was. The only negative was one of the elevators was broken so the one working had long waits and was always packed.,5,2023,04,24
209,Disappointed.,"Nice hotel, great location, walking distance to great shops, parks and restaurants. Staff were great, from housekeeping to reception. Only problem with this hotel is the manager. A young man with an imperious attitude and severely lacking in people skills. He could learn a thing or two on how to interact with people from his staff. Unfortunately he is the reason for the poor review. I would also question the 5 star rating on this hotel, a four at best.",2,2023,04,23
209,Amazing 10/10 - Read this for an honest review,"Please read this review:

(Disclaimer: I stayed here a total of 8 nights)

Let me just start off by saying I’ve traveled domestic and abroad to plenty of hotels. The Conrad Dublin is by far the best of them all. It starts off with management - Andrew Moore. A man that is meant for the hospitality business. His leadership shows as his employees are some of the most kind, caring, and hard working there is. 

The hotel itself boasts plenty of amazing food, coffee, bar selections. Whatever mood you’re in; the Conrad is there to offer it. Whether it’s a late night drink, easy going/delightful breakfast buffet, or a fancy dinner with a loved one. This hotel has it all and the food at each is superb (10/10).

When it come to the room, there is absolutely nothing more they could do better. The room layout is perfect. The minibar has everything you need. There is a great selection of drinks/snacks to take care of you after a long day. A room service menu that provides an awesome selection of meals when you just want to stay in. But the best of all, the comfort the bed provides. I don’t know what it is but the bedding and the sheets are the best there is. I’ve never slept better than I did at the Conrad Dublin. It’s to the point where I would pay thousands just to bring it home with me.

Locality: this hotel seats itself in a prime location in Dublin. It’s in walking distance from plenty of amazing sites: Temple Bar, St. Stephen’s Green Park/Mall, Trinity College and the Book of Kells, the National Concert Hall, and so much more. 

Overall: the Conrad Dublin is exceptional.   When I decide to come back to Dublin, I will no doubt stay here. It’s worth every penny and more. There’s a reason high profile celebrities choose the Conrad. They do because it’s the best. And it’s the best because of every single employee who works their heart out to make it the best. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in Dublin. If you choose against the Conrad, your making a mistake.

Special shout-out to a few staff members: Nicky, Declan, Ed, and Alex. You’re all excellent at your jobs and you’re an asset for Hilton. Andrew keep up the good work managing an exceptional team across the board. I will be back soon enough.

5 STARS",5,2023,04,17
209,Luxury and location in Dublin...,"A superb hotel in Dublin.  Our family loved everything about the Conrad. First and foremost is the location.  Very centrally located and steps away from St. Stephens Green.  St. Stephens green is great for kids, couples and just about everyone.  It is a beautiful park.  But also, it is 5 mins away from the secretive Iveagh Garden.  A more secluded park that guards many secrets.  

The staff at the Conrad is just excellent.  They excel at having all your needs taken care of.   Special shout out to Leyre Veloso Cruz, who gave my daughter a stuffed animal related to the Iveagh Gardens.  The bar and restaurant staffs were excellent as well.  The daily breakfast was great.  We never had breakfast anywhere else.  Room staff cleaned rooms quickly every day.  And last but not least a great concierge staff also enhances the stay.  

The rooms are comfy, large and the bathrooms are spacious.

All in all, this will be my hotel for all my future Dublin stays. ",5,2023,04,14
209,Needs help but service very good,"People are lovely so the service really rates high.  Great room service staff and super friendly front desk. Room service food also first class. Good showers and decent bed though on the hard side. Nice gym. Mark down? Rooms are getting old and need repair. Our suite had nicked walls, worn couch, peeling wallpaper and missing grout in bathroom.  Weird there is no business center and a budget rental car company with dodgy customers.. And those folks have access to the rooms thanks to elevators without any security. Time for refresh and a rethink.",4,2023,04,14
209,Such a fabulous experience!,"We had a perfect stay at the Conrad Dublin. Not only the whole team is professional, outgoing, confident, smiling,  and caring, but the hotel itself offers very large sparkling clean guestrooms and superb facilities. The breakfast is delightful, with a wide fresh choice, laid out in a very elegant way.
Special thanks to Natalia M, Faime from Housekeeping, Sara from the bar, Ninka from breakfast, Alexander and his front office team. Each of you, in your own way, made our stay very unique. ",5,2023,04,13
209,Fabulous,"One of the best hotel in town. Quite location in city centre. Staff are all professionals helpful and with warm approach to guests. Comfortable bed. 
Restaurant  staff are brilliant particularly during breakfast. I’ll book again in this Hotel in the future. ",5,2023,04,06
209,"Good location, friendly staff, nice rooms","Felt welcomed since the arrival. Staff is professional and friendly. Room was nice and big and the location was good. Pets are welcome, we had a dog. They not allowed in the restaurant though. In Ireland it a bit complicated with pets compared to other countries. I recommend this hotel. ",5,2023,03,31
209,Great Conrad experience.,"The greatest asset to this hotel is it's staff, very friendly and welcoming. The hotels location is great because it is in a quiet area of Dublin, but still within walking distance to do things. Breakfast is great, buffet along with a hot menu. Bar and staff at Terrace were good. Concierge was exceptional. Only faults would be the room is dated and in need of new furnishings, couch cushion had large tear and mattress should have been replaced years ago, light switches are a little complicated.  Housekeeping was outstanding!",5,2023,03,27
209,A bit positive and a bit negative,"For the positive:  The concierge, the restaurants, and the staff were outstanding. 
For the negative: My room demonstrated great signs of wear. The bathroom had huge stains especially near the stool. 
For the negative: I realize that the economy has been difficult during the last few years, but I always felt that 'The Conrad"" was a step above huge bus tours, etc.  It would certainly appear that I am in error. 
I have stayed at this hotel many times and I felt a bit disappointed even though the concierge, the restaurants and the staff were outstanding. ",4,2023,03,20
209,Great bar staff ,"Visited the Conrad recently after a trip the concert hall - the hotel is beautiful and the staff in the bar are a credit to the hotel - such a nice welcome, great service and a wonderful drinks and cocktail menu ",5,2023,03,18
209,"Stunning hotel, 10/10 service, great location","This is a beautiful hotel near St Stephen’s Green with welcoming service, gorgeous rooms, great attention to detail and delicious breakfast. We got the 700 bus from the airport to Leeson St Lower and then it was just a 3 minute walk.

The room amenities are lovely, especially the robes. On arrival I had a little chocolate happy birthday plate which was a beautiful surprise. We really enjoyed how helpful everyone was and the amazing food.

Only advice would be if you are in a hurry, stick to the buffet breakfast as the al la carte items took a while on both days we stayed. Luckily we weren’t in a hurry so it was no problem for us. You can always help yourself to a Mimosa while you wait 🥂

The hotel was only a 15 minute walk to the ‘city centre’ but a pleasant walk so it was never an issue. Special mention to Judith, Daniel and Miguel for their exceptional service.",5,2023,03,11
209,Perfect hotel to celebrate my birthday,"I have just returned from a fantastic surprise weekend trip to Dublin for my 60th birthday made all the more memorable by a fabulous stay at The Conrad. I was made to feel so special being given a birthday cake at breakfast and having the staff and other residents sing “Happy Birthday” to having champagne, chocolates and fruit left in our room. A particular thanks must go to Alex for arranging these lovely birthday treats and giving us a really warm welcome to the hotel and Dublin.
All the staff are amazing – so eager to help you with nothing being too much trouble and they are so polite and professional.
Breakfast was very high quality with an excellent choice of food and drink. Our upgraded room was very spacious and well equipped with a lovely comfy bed.
In a great location – it was easy to walk to the pubs, shops and Dublin attractions.

209,Luxury and personalised stay in a beautifully modern hotel!,"We have just returned from a fabulous 2 night stay at the gorgeous Conrad hotel in Dublin, where we were celebrating my mother in laws birthday. From the moment we arrived, every team member with whom we engaged was so thoughtful and kind, from the front office team who gave us a friendly welcome and had our upgraded room available ahead of check in time, the chatty breakfast team who always paid interest in our plans for the day, and the super attentive house keeping staff. Thanks to the team for helping organise some birthday surprises such as a cake and champagne in our room - a really lovely touch. The hotel is well located for all of the city’s top attractions in a quiet part of the town centre. A personal highlight for me was the great breakfast - an extensive buffet selection and an A la carte offering - we even enjoyed mimosas with our food! Thank you to everyone at team Conrad Dublin who made our stay so special - can’t wait to come back!",5,2023,03,07
209,Good visit,"Conrad brand raley disappoints, and the Dublin Conrad was no except. Quick check in, comfortable room, except buffet breakfast (with hot coffee). Only negatives were the inroom coffee machine was not working and they were out of beef pie in the restaurant on Saturday. Otherwise a pleasant overnight stay in Dublin.",5,2023,03,06
209,"Beautiful hotel, nice location, but unorganized checkin experience.","Such a nice property with an ideal location. However when we checked in early, we were told we’d have to wait until check-in time which was of course fine. They informed that as i am a Diamond member, they’d see if they can get me in earlier. When we returned to the hotel at around 5pm, after checkin, they informed my room was still yet to be ready, while others were arriving and going right to their rooms after not waiting all day like we were. We came into Dublin on an overnight flight and we’re Exhausted around 5pm when we still couldn’t get our room. 

They were very unorganized but apologetic. It seemed clear they were busy but this wasn’t acceptable. 

On the other hand, the hotel and rooms were very elegant. Clean rooms, comfortable stay and a very delicious and elegant breakfast. The hotel is situated not too far from downtown. I’d stay here again if they were able to ensure check in at a promised time.",3,2023,03,03
209,Mixed hotel - service lacks down decent rooms,"Mixed experience overall - not up to Conrad standards and limited recognition of Diamond status.

clearly an 1980s hotel that has been recently refurbished. as Hilton Diamond got an upgrade to a premium room with an unusual balcony accessed through windows up a little step. Room was spacious - one and half height, panneled wall and wood floor with rug accents. Facilities as you would expect for 5* hotel, nespresso machine, kettle. 

But:

- bathroom was a little old-skool, large but over bath shower which wasn't very effective. could have had a walk-shower in space
- no recognition of HH status at checkin - I knew I had an upgrade from the app before arriving, but staff at checkin were very transactional and no real interaction at all. At checkout the member of staff was polar opposite and very friendly. Not a great start
- one of two lifts out of order - signs to find way to lobby by stairs (1st floor) but not clear, and hard to get to the basement fitness area
- housekeeping was odd - turndown service, but standards weren't great. I came back after a very busy work day and room was turned down, but when I went to bed I realised someone else's T-shirt was weirdly on table in bathroom. It was late and I was going to bed, I just put in bin - but only after leaving did I think how odd it was (it was also stinky).  I assume had been picked up on a room to room check and then for some reason accidentally put down in the room. But poor attention to detail
- gym was ok - lots of space, but two sets of dumb-bells only going to 20kg - could easily go up to 30 or 40kg like other hotels do - and Leinster rugby club is meant to use the hotel, they must bring their own!
- breakfast was mixed - food was ok, but service was incredibly slow. First day my order of tea took ages, and my hot food order just didn't arrive. Staff were inattentive, although they were gushing over other guests - was really odd. I just ended up getting food from buffet as was going to office. Second day similar, got pretty much ignored by staff.
- bar was ok - expensive, but nice enough. Ate lunch in slightly soul-less restaurant downstairs - was ok, but who puts egg mayo in a club sandwich. All a bit odd.

Having stayed at other Conrad's in UK and US recently, not a patch on the service or standards in other hotels. I may consider staying there again as it's convenient to the office, but would have liked a better overall experience for the cost of the hotel (it's on a corporate listing too for my work). Service needs work - I wasn't asked how my stay was, and didn't get a chance to fill in the survey after due to work commitments (as it expires after 7 days).",2,2023,02,25
209,Beautiful Hotel,"Had a two-night stay at the Conrad. The staff were amazing, offering help with anything required which included booking our taxi to the airport. Breakfast was high quality, large amount of options and was tasty. The room itself was modern, clean and well-equipped. The location was great and there was a small park nearby which was quiet and beautiful as well as St Stephens Green which itself is a beautiful park to walk around too. My only complaint was there was a few missing channels on the TV but we did not travel to watch TV but rather explore the city!",5,2023,02,15
209,Absolutely perfect,"We had a lovely overnight stay here after a show. We opted for an upgrade from the Hilton Honors app and we were delighted with our decision. We chose a junior suite. It is by far the nicest room we have ever stayed in. All the additional bits you hope for when choosing to stay at a 5 star hotel.
We had breakfast and lunch in the hotel and some drinks in the bar too. All meals and drinks were excellent and servedwith a smile. Overall the most noticeable impression on us was the friendliness and professional attitude of all staff. Thank you for helping is have a lovely stay. We will definitely return when next in town for a show. Two additional points to note, this hotel is quiet and peaceful. We were pleased with that.  Also, there is a quaint little park 200m away to walk to, The Iveagh Gardens as well as St Stephens Green to explore.
",5,2023,01,31
209,A place where our great memories of Ireland began,"Where do I begin with my praise? my husband and I planned this trip by first being contacted by reservation agent Alexei Potter, who was thorogh in setting up our initial details, we were then in constant contact with the consierge team and Leyre Veloso Cruz  to set up our plans and reservations during our stay, we were traveling from the US and it was important to set up as much as we could prior to arrival and they understood this and took care of it accordingly, everything in the Hotel from the housekeeping staff who kept our room spotless and never missed a turn down, to the attentive restaurant staff and bartenders like German (who happily created a personalized drink for me) were exemplary, I was only able to share a personal ""thank-you"" with a couple of these team members, but I am now able to share how amazingly well this Hotel is run through this review. My husband is a Hotel Executive who has run multiple Hotels and I also worked in 5 star Hotel in Washington DC so we both know how a Hotel should be run properly, what a treat to have experienced this kind of service in a place that we have come to love and will return to every year. Ireland was amazing and this Hotel is a Gem, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.",5,2023,01,16
209,Christmas in Dublin at the Conrad.,Leyre and the rest of the staff were so very warm and welcoming. Our young son was worried that Santa would miss him while in Dublin. Leyre arranged for a Christmas tree to be placed in our room to ensure Santa would come.   Every effort was made to create memorable stay. It really is the little things that matter and the Conrad staff delivered. We are planning our next stay!,5,2023,01,15
209,"Location, Location, Location",Great location overlooking The National Convert Hall - with St Stephens Green a stone throw away makes for exploring Dublin and the surrounding towns. Lemuel’s always lively with great cocktails & nibbles,5,2023,01,13
209,Nice room pity about the food and service certainly not 5 star !,"Had lunch in Bar, food was average. Dined in Anna Haugh restaurant which was totally overrated !  Service not good at all -not impressed for the prices charged certainly lacked 5 star experience. Would not recommend this place. Only positive experience was the spacious bedrooms.",2,2023,01,03
209,Sorry not up to scratch,"I travelled to Ireland on business in December. I wanted a central hotel so as to be able to reach everywhere on foot so I choose the Conrad.
Arrived at the hotel and was registered at check in, all fine and very helpful.
Was shown to the lifts help with my luggage no complaints whatsoever.
Got to my room left my luggage and left for a meeting.
Decided to order room service and was shocked at the most bad mannered person on the other side anything I requested was not possible. This is supposed to be a a top hotel.
I head to the bathroom and was very very surprised to find hairs in the bath, stains all around the toilet. 
Totally shocked its now midnight and I have no intention of having room service come up as I have a meeting at 7am

Next morning pay my bill and leave.

I would like to add that I travel quite a lot across the world for work and as far as top hotels are concerned this is definitely not in the rank.

",2,2022,12,29
209,Fantastic Hotel ideally located close to everything in Dublin,"My wife and I wrapped up a 2 week tour of UK and Ireland with 3 nights and The Conrad and it was the perfect way to conclude our vacation. The hotel itself is beautiful, with great bars, restaurant and facilities and the staff were just amazing - friendly, welcoming and always helpful. We will definitely return here!",5,2022,12,23
209,Outstanding Service!,"Customer Service was impeccable! This has a central location as a Dublin base. I can appreciate it was off the busiest path, yet close to all the places that were needed. It was easy to use the Dublin Express airport transport to get there. The on property services were top notch. The staff was professional, courteous and helpful throughout and after my stay. 

I left a parcel in my room after check-out. As I arrived at the airport to leave, I could not find my bag. I called the hotel, they located my bag and mailed it out to me the same day. The communication throughout was excellent. 

The restaurant staff were phenomenal as well. I have a Gluten-Allergy and they were more than willing to help me with a variety of choices throughout my stay. 

The communication with the concierge was outstanding as well, they were helpful in locating great places to see, restaurant recommendations and help with getting taxis when needed.",5,2022,12,10
209,Five Start Accomodations,"Central location and all needed amenities with a great staff always willing to help.

This property doesn’t disappoint.

The restaurant and bar is top notch and convenient with a great selection.

Strongly reccomend for business or personal travel.",5,2022,12,03
209,Dublin business trip,"Excellent throughout.  People, services, food, facilities, staff, welcome, location, just all superb. Really struggling to think of a single thing that wasn’t to a very high standard from the great team at the hotel. ",5,2022,11,25
209,"Nice hotel, good location, exceptional service.","This was one of the best Hotel stays I’ve had in a very long time and it was all about the service. 
There’s a lot of hotels with nice facilities, restaurants and amenities, but for me, what differentiates one from another is the service. All of the staff we encountered at the Conrad were polite and professional and most went out of their way to provide exceptional service. There was one stand out that I have to mention. Her name was Gwen and she set the bar and reminded us what exceptional customer engagement and service feels like. Her outstanding service and support started before we even reached the hotel and never relented. Will definitely be back to the Conrad when I go back to Dublin.",5,2022,11,22
209,"Great Location, Friendly Staff, Nice Rooms","We selected this hotel for its excellent location coupled with a better price than comparable hotels in the area. We were upgraded to the quiet floor as Honors Gold members.  The bed was very comfortable, the breakfast was excellent, and we also enjoyed dinner in the casual restaurant twice.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  ",5,2022,11,18
209,Great hotel,"We loved our stay at the Conrad Dublin. The staff were wonderful and we were especially happy with early check-in!  Our room and bathroom were large and clean. The bed was very comfy! In the room we had a safe, coffee maker, and refrigerator. We enjoyed our breakfast - buffet and a la carte were included with our room. The location was perfect as well - walking distance to shops, pubs, and museums. I'd definitely stay here again.",5,2022,11,16
209,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in,"The hotel was wonderful overall, but the one thing I wanted to share that I think exemplified the stay-

We were booked for a very early tour where we had to be at the bus at 6am.  I asked at the concierge desk the night before just to find out what would be the best way to get to where the bus was leaving from, and what time we should plan to leave.

Without prompting, the concierge arranged to make sure that we would have a continental breakfast to take with us in the morning.

I'm writing this too many months later to give more details, but we didn't have a single bad experience with anyone we dealt with.  We were allowed to check in early (very early- arrived on a red eye in the very early morning) and got a late check out as well.  We got assistance with everything we needed.

Obviously, it is not a cheap place to stay (but then again, I didn't find that much was in Dublin).  But other than that, I cannot recommend it enough.",5,2022,11,15
209,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed whilst visiting Dublin to complete the marathon.
Fantastic location.

Our room was on the third floor close to the lift, this was not an issue as we did not hear any noise which was a welcome relief.

The room was spacious and well equipped.

Overall a great 4 night stay with some great staff.",5,2022,11,13
209,One Week in Dublin,"We visited Dublin in early November so that our son could spend some time with his girlfriend who is attending Trinity College. We chose the Conrad for its location and I am a Hilton Diamond member. The hotel is very nice and the rooms were clean and cheerful. I wished we had a walk in shower but that did not matter much. We were not offered an upgrade even though junior suites and other rooms were available to book. However they did arrange for early check in since we got there around 9-10am. 
I don’t know but Hilton seems very stingy with their upgrades that sometimes you wonder why bother with status. 
The staff were very friendly, even though they seemed short staffed in the restaurants. The location is nice and quiet but an easy 20 min walk to Temple Bar, Trinity, and other areas. Not so close to Guinness or Jameson . The Hop On busses are not too far away just on the north side of the park. 
The food in the Terrace restaurant and the restaurant in the lobby was OK, nothing to write home about. Breakfast buffet had runny eggs each day. I would opt for the Omelette. Pancake was dry and not what you would expect, but give it a whirl you may like it. 
The rooms were nice and serviced each day and the room staff were very nice. 
It may be a bit pricey and if you are leveraging your Hilton awards, this is great. But don’t expect upgrades even as a Diamond . There may be other hotels that are less expensive and have similar quality but not part of a chain that might be worth trying. 
One sore spot for me was we had worked through the front desk to arrange a car to the airport the next morning. To our surprise, no car and we were 40 min off our schedule. ",4,2022,11,13
209,Amazing hotel with friendly staff!,"A wonderful hotel, so close to the city. All the staff from checkin to waitress and bar staff were friendly, attentive and polite.. The hotel and our room was spotless with a gorgeous smell everywhere. Dinner at the bar was exceptional, everyone had a tasty meal. What a choice for breakfast, you will not leave hungry! I would definitely recommend the Conrad if staying in Dublin for a luxurious and peaceful stay within 5 minutes walk to the city.",5,2022,11,09
209,Terrific hotel and staff,"We have traveled to Ireland every year (except for 20 & 21), normally we stay at the Shelbourne. We decided to try somewhere else.  Had stayed at the Conrad a long time ago and had pleasant recollections. We could not have been happier with our choice. In many instances the Conrad surpassed the Shelbourne. We felt everyone from doorman, concierge, and wait staff to cleaning personnel were more than welcoming, pleasant, helpful, and professional.  The food is exceptional. We found the room very clean, comfortable and stuffed with amenities, such as hair dryer, iron and board, comfy slippers and robes.  Will definitely be staying with The Conrad on our next visit.",5,2022,11,08
209,"Great rooms, location and service","The Conrad Dublin is beautifully located, just steps from St. Stephen’s Green and Merrion Square. The hotel itself has wonderful appointed rooms, especially the suites and larger single rooms, and the service is outstanding. The bar is actually quite nice as well.",5,2022,11,04
209,"Excellent, as you would expect","Stayed here with family. The location is great- very handy to downtown Dublin, and the gardens nearby are lovely. The food at each of the restaurants was very nice, and the breakfast was excellent. Having a car hire in the building was a real bonus . Staff were friendly and helpful",5,2022,10,22
209,Great hotel,Beautiful hotel! Truly a quiet oasis. Very well located near st Stevens green. Very easy to navigate the city from here. Breakfast was very good. Bar was a bit stuffy and pretty empty. Great late night snack on the lower level - good food and quick service ,5,2022,10,16
209,wow............must be easy to get 5 stars in dublin,"not good..............staff shortages.................bar terrible..............lack of quality drinks...............no club orange...........no lucozade..........no cidona.........no real 7up..............no ginger ale to help with brandy...............bar man grumpy.......no greetings, no thank you on payment...................lots of work to do to get up to 4 stars.......................forget 5...........................no pool................... wow wow..................",1,2022,10,14
209,"Incompetency, bad event management, Overpriced ","I attended a Ball here last Friday September 30th and the positives were the venue, the staff, the comfort and cleanliness.  The negatives were totally disorganisation at the bar, the staff did not have a clue how to pull pints, one member being trained in at a busy bar on how to pull a pint of Guinness, a disaster and then charging full price.  The wine was overpriced at €50 per bottle some people being charged and others not.  Some people never saw the wine menu or the prices.  The food was late, small portions, nothing special, we waited two hours for our main course which was dried up, even though we had to select our choices days in advance, there was mass confusion, so you just took whatever they had, one small cereal bowl of vegetables came to our table for 8 people, 3 bowls of chips arrived during the one hour wait between first and second course ..we gave up on dessert something came but dancing had started.  This was an expensive meal at over 70€ person.  It is a managerial problem with not enough staff, poor coordination, an aspiration menu but serving less than canteen quality, overpriced wine and drinks in general making a mockery of the client.   I would never recommend Conrad for an event or business function.  ",2,2022,10,04
209,Disappointing - Below expectations,"My wife and I splurged to stay at the Conrad paying over $650/night. We reserved a King view room. Upon arrival, our reserved room had been given away and we were given another room. Upon entering the room, it was clear that the room was occupied and so we exited quickly and went back to the lobby. The next room was supposedly an upgrade but did not turn out that way. Entering the room, we found chocolates and a bottle of wine. Not bad. Only after we opened the bottle and tried a piece of chocolate, did we see the note addressed to someone else and welcoming them to the hotel. So, clearly, somewhere in the hotel was another guest who did not get what they had reserved. And interestingly enough, someone from the hotel took away the remaining chocolates. I hope they did not serve them to some other guest.

The room itself was fine but the bathroom was very budget hotel feeling. The heating/cooling controls did not seem to work so we had to sleep with our window open to cool the room.

The restaurant was fine and the breakfast good. 

So certainly not worth the cost and below what I would have expected from Conrad.",3,2022,10,04
209,Definitely not 5 star,"V disappointed with our stay in this supposedly 5 star hotel. Cost was  €2100 for 2 nights. (Garth Brooks weekend!!). A crazy price but we thought it must be a great experience. 1st problem. Bathroom door would not close….at all. Door had been battered closed a few times so it was definitely an old problem. Finally fixed at 5pm on day 2. Room not serviced at all until we actually rang down to check what was happening. Also carried out around 5pm. 

Definitely a lack of staffing issues in the Terrace restaurant.  Food was ok throughout but not so great on the 2nd morning when my husbands eggs royal actually was eggs raw!! 1 egg was poached the 2nd egg totally raw. No butter/salt on table. We had to keep asking for help. 

On leaving when asked how our stay was we mentioned the bathroom door. The very nice receptionist said that should not have happened and she would contact her boss and hopefully one of our evening meals would be taken off the final bill. I gave my email and was told the manager would contact me. No contact at all and the full cost for our additional meals was taken from my credit card. 

We won’t be visiting again.",2,2022,09,25
209,Lucy and Mom in Dublin,"I never leave reviews, but our stay was so great I had to! We absolutely loved our Conrad experience. The location was perfect for touring Dublin! The staff made our trip! I would absolutely stay here again. ",5,2022,09,23
209,September at the Conrad Dublin,"Last minute trip to Dublin. The town was unexpectedly busy with Garth Brooks fans. Ended up for the first time at the Conrad. Great location just a block from the beautiful Saint Stephen’s Green Park. Grafton Street, with its amazing shopping, pubs, and buskers, was easily within walking distance on the other side of the park. Staff at the Conrad was wonderful as were Coburg Restaurant and Lemuel’s bar. Great place to stage a great time in Dublin!",5,2022,09,21
209,Amazing experience at the bar & terrace,"Loved the ambience, but what really stood out was the service level. Everybody was magnificent, had great attemtion to detail, and were very accommodating - especially Alex!

I am very grateful for her snack recommendation: the truffle fries with parmesan!",5,2022,09,20
209,Highly recommend!,"The hubs and I just got back from a 9 night vacation to Dublin and we stayed at the Conrad Dublin the whole time. I spent weeks researching where I wanted to stay and ultimately decided on the Conrad due to its location outside of the loud Temple Bar area, but close enough to walk there and to other entertainment areas and St Stephens Green. I’m also a Hilton Honors member so I tend to gravitate to those hotels, and Conrad’s are very nice. First off - our flight got in at 5am and we got to the hotel just after 6. I was thinking “there is no way they are going to give us an early check in this early” and resigned myself to checking in luggage and walking around like a zombie for the next 9-10 hours. I was wrong! The front desk was so great and got us right into a room where we were able to grab a couple of hours sleep before we started our vacation in earnest. The rooms are spacious and modern with an upscale coffee machine and refrigerator. The bed was comfy and the air conditioning rocked (I love sleeping in a cool room). The food at the Terrace Kitchen and Social was outstanding! We ate there twice and the Fish and Chips was literally the best I’ve ever eaten. Lemuel’s was a very nice bar and the bartenders were friendly. Granted it was all pricy, but you get what you pay for. I can’t say anything negative about this stay. Everyone was attentive and practiced excellent customer service.",5,2022,09,17
209,Nice enough but less than stellar service,"The hotel is clean and beds are comfortable, but our ""upgraded"" room was very small. I should have known prior to arrival that the service was lacking, since each time I contacted the concierge to arrange dinner or car service it took several days before anyone responded. Very impersonal service, no bell staff, one overworked concierge, and no one to solve any problems -- changing money, printing boarding passes, reserving a taxi. It is not a five-star hotel; only stay if you get a bargain. Certainly it's not worth $500/night.",3,2022,09,16
209,Gave it a second chance,"Stayed here on two separate occasions recently. The first didn't go so well, perhaps due to the large number of guests in town for an American football game? Unfortunately it was a comedy of errors and I left feeling like I'd stayed at a budget motel and somebody had taken all my cash whilst I was in the shower. The second visit was completely different and was at the level of service that I'd expected for this class of hotel. Hit and miss or just a bad day - hopefully the latter.",4,2022,09,07
209,Disappointing -  very disappointing.,"Having been a Hilton Honors member for years and remaining loyal as much as possible - I had high hopes of my first visit back to Dublin.  I arrived soaked around 2.30 to an empty lobby and bar, but found that my room was not ready.  I was assured someone would text me when it was.  After an hour with no notification and decidedly damp, I went back to reception.  The same receptionist was on the desk but deeply engaged with foursome and their dog and a queue formed.  At one point she left the desk, and the queue, to wander over and deal with a luggage issue.  Clearly understaffed.  Eventually a second person turned up and I was issued with a key.  I had had an email to say my room had been upgraded - but I can't imagine what from.  It was a modern, clean, uninspiring room but it was on the 6th floor with views over an office building.
The bathroom was good and well equipped.  There was a robe and slippers.
Having dealt with my very damp clothes I sorted myself out and ordered room service.  I chose room service because the place was totally lacking in atmosphere - it was so echoey.  Room service was fast - but it was awful.  Fish and chips and a tiny pot of peas.  The peas were lovely!  The chips were passable.  The fish was totally overcooked, brown, hard and had a plastic thing hanging out of it.  I left most of it.  I did photograph it on my phone but decided not to tweet it in case I put people off their suppers.  
When I was leaving very early the next morning I said to the receptionist that the room service meal was unfit for purpose, to which he replied ""oh, that's good"".  
The room was nearly £500.  Totally inadequate service for that fee.",3,2022,09,06
209,Great hotel!  Super friendly staff and all the amenities you could want.,"I have never stayed at a place, foreign or domestic, with a friendlier staff.  The room was quiet and modern, which I wanted.  Great lighting in bathroom which is not always the case.  I have no complaints whatsoever. ",5,2022,09,01
209,Best value for a 5 stars in Dublin,"Having stayed in all 5 stars in Dublin, we were happily surprised by the size of the rooms of the Conrad when we visited with family over the Holidays. Perfectly comfortable and appointed, even though a bit more cookie-cutter than the other options, it was a very good value while offering everything one expects to find at such hotels.  We enjoyed the restaurants and personnel was very helpful.  the fact that a car rental agency was in the hotel was a bonus and the location rivals with all other high-end options.",5,2022,08,31
209,Excellent hotel in a great location.,"This is a delightful luxury hotel.  Room is attractive.  Good fitness center.  Breakfast food and service were excellent.   The bartenders in the bar off of the lobby are very friendly and make excellent craft cocktails.  Every staff member we encountered was pleasant and friendly.  

Location is very good with easy walk to many attractions and Temple Bar.  

Our room included water and a nice coffee maker with all of the necessary accessories and condiments. 

Highly recommended.",5,2022,08,23
209,Couple,"We spent a night at Conrad. Dorcas from Barcelona was our server and she was very good. Conrad is very lucky to have her. I recently got promoted and she gave me a plate. Definitely be back again.

Room was fanatic and no issues.

Amazing stay at Conrad.",5,2022,08,22
209,"Great location close to everything, but you can still get away at night","Just a short walk from hotel through St. Stephens Green to the touristy areas. Super clean, friendly staff, comfy room, good amenities (shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotion, hair dryer). Great to be able to safely and easily walk everywhere but also to get back to silence to recharge at night. Well-equipped fitness center.",4,2022,08,21
209,Terrible Service,"The hotel has a lot of potential but service, starting from the top down, was truly atrocious. My stay felt like an episode of Fawlty Towers rather than a supposedly luxury hotel stay. The only positives were that the rooms themselves were nicely appointed and the breakfast staff and food were amazing. The negatives:

1. I was initially upgraded prior to my stay to a better standard room (diamond/amex fine hotels) by the front of house manager, however, in checking my reservation the day prior to check in I noticed I was downgraded to a standard room. I reached out to John to inquire what happened and never received a reply. I called the hotel and also inquired at check in and the staff couldnt tell me why the rather minimal upgrade had been taken away. I was told that John would follow up within 15 minutes. I never heard from John at any point during my 3 night stay, despite an email to him, a message by the staff to him to contact me, and the assurance of the front desk staff. It is clear management does not care about their guests.
2. I called for turndown on my last night and when I returned to my room over 3 hours later had not received it. In calling the front desk I was initially told it was too late to have turndown performed by that point but after push back they agreed. In approaching the front desk about what had happened I was rudely told it was being taken care of without any sort of apology or recognition that the delay meant I had to wait in the hotel lobby after a long and hot evening of sightseeing. No offer of a drink of the bar or anything.
3. About 75% of the time, calls to the front desk went unanswered after ringing for a few minutes.
4. Dinner staff did not have knowledge of the items on the menu. In addition, the dinner menu had zero Irish items, but rather, burgers, pizza and chicken wings.
5. Air conditioning barely worked and the room felt like a sauna at night.
6. Amex fine hotel stays come with a $100 USD property credit. Despite the exchange rate being at parity, the hotel only applied a $93 credit and wouldn't budge. This felt dishonest at best. 
7. Bell staff saw us approaching the hotel with luggage and did not make any attempt to welcome us or help carry our luggage up the stairs.
8. Breakfast through room service is available until 11am. In calling at 10:50am was initially told it was too late but was told that the kitchen would make an exception.",1,2022,08,19
209,Horrendous experience. Not even close to being a 5 star hotel,"This hotel is a total disaster, specifically the front desk. 

Upon arrival, they gave a cold greeting and did not offer to help with the luggage. Breakfast was decent, the service was terrible the 1st day, but by day 2 they turned it around. The room was a sauna (it was a hot week in Ireland) and clearly the air conditioning system is not suitable nor affective to keep these rooms cool. I get Ireland is usually cold, but global warming exists and summers in Europe are hot. Throughout this process I checked in with the front desk who did not provide me any updates or information regarding the status of the air conditioning unit. They were like deers in the headlights, honestly appalling that they were unable to communicate with maintenance about what was going on. At some point maintenance seemed to “fix” it but it was still extremely hot in the room. A five star hotel should have proper air conditioning units if they advertise that their rooms provide air conditioning.

 When we checked out there was no “thank you for staying with us” or “have a nice day”. We left our luggage in their luggage storage for a few hours as we had time to kill before our flight. When we returned to the hotel they couldn’t find our luggage!! 3 of the front desk people were checking all sorts of back rooms and coming out to ask us over and over again what the bags look like. After their third attempt one of the women at the front desk appeared to want to give up. I told her that was not an option, plus my passport was in there! I asked permission to go in the back and look for the luggage myself (at this point have been waiting over 20 minutes) and they said NO. Finally another gentleman brought out our luggage. All of the employees at the front desk just stood there, no apologies, nothing!!!  Disgusting, this place is a 3-4 star hotel on a good day. Will NEVER stay here again. Run, don’t walk to a different hotel.",1,2022,08,13
209,Great centrally located hotel with amazing customer service and staff,"We had the most amazing customer service at this hotel. All the staff were attentive and went beyond. We had just arrived in Dublin after a very long flight and the staff were able to accommodate us in checking in early. The rooms was great and bed was very comfortable. Breakfast had a great variety of items and so delicious. Restaurant staff were also so friendly and offered superb customer service.
Hotel is located centrally and walking distance to all the attractions in Dublin. 
We will definitely stay at the Conrad hotels in the future.",5,2022,08,12
209,Marvelous place to stay,"First time for a Conrad Hilton for us. We've stayed at the regular Hilton properties including the Curio brand (also nice) but we felt like we couldn't have been treated better. We were having a wonderful long vacation and disembarked from a cruise in Dublin early on a Sunday morning. I called the day before and the concierge arranged a pickup at the port. I spoke with front desk about an early check in, no problem. We were in the room by 10:00a.m. The room was well appointed and the breakfast included was the best we've experienced. Staff was gracious and bent over backwards for any and all request. If we find ourselves in Dublin anytime, we will be back to the Conrad. BTW within walking distance to most places you want to go.",5,2022,08,11
209,Top hotel,"Just back from a recent one night stay. 

As expected this hotel is exceptional and their standards are of a a very high quality. 

Nice to be able to check in and select room prior to arrival. 

Valet parking available but parking is right beside the hotel ( €20 ) a night in city centre is good. 

Terrace bar was really nice, all staff very good and food was nice. Not sure why they close so early, would make a lovely night time bar too. 

Main bar - drinks and service as good as you expect. Closed at 12 which is strange as the bar was very busy but then emptied immediately. 

Would highly recommend for their top quality standard. Good location for a city break.",4,2022,08,07
209,Wonderful stay,"We stayed 2 nights and had a fabulous stay! The hotel is in a great location in near Saint Stephen’s Green Park. Our room was spacious and beautifully decorated. Because my husband is a diamond member we were upgraded to a larger room with a beautiful welcome tray. The staff at the hotel were all very welcoming, gracious, kind and helpful. It was a real treat to stay here.",5,2022,08,07
209,Exceptional service and accommodations,"This hotel is great. We had a superb experience. Everyone helpful in every way. The room was perfect , nice amenities. Restaurant was good . We enjoyed a nice breakfast  and lunch. The concierge helped us with transportation from cruise ship and to the airport. Recommended an Irish pub that we enjoyed. Truly a great hotel .",5,2022,07,27
209,great place for overnight stay,"Traveling back from Rhodes Island, we needed an overnight place. We found this hotel. The price was very inexpensive (compared to the Rhodes Island Cabin!). The lady that welcomed us was. very friendly and helpful. Steering us to a wine place. It is across the street from an Applebees so inexpensive dinner. The room was very clean, the A/C worked great. Breakfast was basically your normal small buffet, Waffles, microwave sandwiches, and cereals. The guy behind the checkout was helpful. The hotel is situated a little bit off the highway, like maybe 3/4 to a mile away, so easy access. I liked it because price was right, clean, and friendly staff.  One minor thing, Pillows were really soft, but that is just me, i like a very hard/firm pillow.",4,2022,07,24
209,Great hotel,"The Conrad Dublin is definitely worth a visit. Clean rooms, friendly staff and a solid location within Dublin. The staff is extremely friendly and kind and will be glad to help you find a cool tour of the city or a hood restaurant for dinner. The breakfast selection is extensive and tasty and the staff and multinational so it was very interesting to hear about their homes and experiences",5,2022,07,21
209,"Lovely Hotel, Excellent Staff, Comfortable Room","After an overnight flight in economy class, we hoped that we'd have a room ready despite the morning hour.  What a pleasure to find that our room was ready and waiting for us!  The front desk staff were very nice and efficient.  The room was clean and comfortable with a large and comfy bed.  The location is on a quiet street directly across the street from the Concert Hall where the symphony plays.  In back is a lovely garden where we had a late lunch when we awoke from our nap.  The atmosphere was beautiful, the staff was pleasant and attentive, and the food was good.  Also, the hotel concierge was very helpful with his recommendations and directions.",5,2022,07,18
209,Fantastic stay!,"From check-in, to room cleanliness, to service at the bar and restaurants, every aspect of my stay was 5*. The breakfast is absolutely amazing! 
Service is to the highest standards throughout the hotel, every staff member we encountered was extremely pleasant. Thank you Conrad team!",5,2022,07,13
209,Lovely stay at this hotel!!,"Staying in this hotel for the first time, did not have much expectations from the hotel. But to our surprise we had such a good time staying there and wished we could have extended our stay. The moment we entered the hotel we got a warm welcome from the front desk. We got upgraded to a beautiful room. Since it was our anniversary and my husband had conveyed the information while booking. We had delicious chocolates, strawberry, wine and hand written note waiting for us in the room. We ended up having dinner at the restaurant in the hotel itself that was very fresh and delicious. The staff at the restaurant was also very accommodating and helpful. All in all we had a great stay at this hotel and would love to come back again there someday. To all the people working at this hotel keep up the good work 😊",5,2022,07,12
209,Wonderful Stay,"What a perfect venue to begin our Ireland adventure. The hotel is well situated and the staff and accommodations were great,  especially John at the front desk who, upon learning it was our anniversary, gifted us with a complimentary breakfast during our stay. Having the Sixt car rental in the hotel was an added bonus. We’ll be back on our next visit to Dublin.",5,2022,07,08
209,Lackluster service for the price,"Overpriced, and terrible service. Go to another 5-star hotel nearby. The rooms were fine, but I was very disappointed with the service for a hotel that costs $500+ night. No one greeting you when walking in, check in process was clunky and took a long time. Most annoyingly, we left something behind and cannot get anyone from the hotel to respond.",3,2022,07,06
209,"Nice hotel, bit overpriced","I frequently travel to Dublin, but this was my first stay in the Conrad. It is a perfectly reasonable hotel in a good location for exploring the city. But, I think there are better propositions in the city at this price bracket.",3,2022,07,05
209,Horrible Service we’re treated horribly,"Booked this hotel through American Express with the fine hotels and resorts program and had high hopes as I have had for any other hotel I have stayed at under the same category.  I booked two rooms and called a day  ahead to ensure that the rooms were connecting or at least next to each other and as a Hilton gold member and an American Express platinum card holder I expected this to be done no problem.  We arrived to the hotel and were extremely disappointed to see that they put us in rooms on the 3rd floor and the 6th floor which was very far from my kids and was extremely disappointed and angry that my simple request wasn’t granted.  We were told that they would solve the issue the next morning and we were fine with that.  The next morning comes and they said they were working on it and they finally called us back at 5 pm saying our new rooms were ready.  But they weren’t.  We waited another 1-2 hours for the other room to be finished and it wasn’t what we needed. They wanted one of our sons to sleep on a sofa bed instead of a queen like we booked.  This caused frustration to our family and made our visit to Dublin miserable and we kept having to argue with management even though we simply wanted the rooms we booked next to each other.  With 1/2 of our visit wasted on figuring out rooms we still didn’t have what we needed for our stay through the stay and management got mad at us and frankly didn’t care.  They were snobby and could care les about the situation even though the rates were high and we had status and AMEX on our side.  Lastly, we went to dinner at their restaurant and were treated like 3rd class citizens.  We waited one hour for our food and people around us who sat after us were already leaving before we got our food.  WHICH WAS RAW and HORRIBLE.  It was so bad another couple dining at the restaurant noticed and came up to our table wondering why that had happened to us.  If someone else noticed this failure it can be said that the service at this hotel was horrible at best and we were treated like 3rd class citizens instead of paying customers.",2,2022,07,02
209,What a joke!,"Not impressed at all. As a Diamond member of Hilton, I usually go out of my way to book at a Hilton where possible. Not anymore after this stay. 
Travelling with family, I requested for an early check-in after we got to the hotel. Not only did I not get an early checkin (understandable, it's not possible always) but they didn't have rooms ready even after the official checkin time. Now, that is unacceptable. The management tried to blame it on housekeeping - shortage of staff, all of that. Here's what I think really happened: the incompetent front-desk staff they have at this hotel made no effort whatsoever to get us checked in. They either simply forgot to get the housekeeping involved or just didn't care enough. The official checkout time is 12. Checkin time is 3 pm. How long does it take to get a room ready? Once I escalated this to management, the rooms were ready within minutes - definitely can't blame housekeeping staff. And the hotel didn't seem busy at all.  I saw many people arriving after us, and checking in earlier than us. Families are clearly not a priority for this hotel. Whoever is running this place needs to wake up and fix this joke of a place.
I'm disappointed, to say the least. 
Rooms are nothing special. One of the rooms has a fridge that doesn't work. Room service food can only be described as 'weird' - the pasta tasted like some apprentice was practicing on our meals. 
We're still at this place for the rest of the week so I might update this review but honestly, I don't see things improving.",1,2022,06,28
209,Beautiful rooms in a prime location!,"The hotel itself was beautiful! We loved the area that this hotel was located. It was super close (definitely walking distance) to most of the touristy stuff in the city. We loved walking through St. Stephen’s Green, which was a very short walk on your way into the city center. The rooms were a really great size, especially for European standards and very bright. The bed was super comfortable! The only issue we ran into was with our reservation, and it was a nightmare. I had booked using points for a couple of nights and with free night rewards for the others. I needed to shorten my trip by one night, and they couldn’t seem to figure out how to cancel just one night of the trip. It ended up meaning I spent HOURS on the phone during my vacation trying to get it sorted,  followed by the hotel telling me they needed to cancel the free nights and could offer me a “great deal” of something like $400 a night. Considering I had booked it for free using hard earned points, I’d hardly consider that a deal. It was eventually worked out, but was a huge pain to deal with during my vacation.",4,2022,06,27
209,Perfect for Business Travel,Clean and well kept for being a older Hilton property. The staff is 5-star service. Everyone was attentive and incredible. The rooms are large in size but outdated in style but still well kept. Definitely not a room you would want to spend your day in if you had to do a little work but perfect for sleeping. The pillows and bedding were so comfortable! I slept really well here.,3,2022,06,25
209,In no way a 5 star hotel,"We stay at the Conrad brand where ever we go in the world and the Conrad Dublin let’s the brand down big time! From the moment our taxi pulled up at the Conrad dublin I knew this was not going to be the experience I expected. The steps leading  up to the door were filthy ( not a good first impression ) Then we were met by a rather chatty doorman/bellboy who’s appearance was scruffy at best with stained jacket etc. when checking in we were promised that our room would have a good view, but when we were brought to the room the view was of a nasty wall with dirty windows and we were just over a bank of dirty air conditioners. Do people really accept these rooms when paying 5 star prices? Everything went down from there, from dirty furniture to window frames that badly need replacing and don’t get me started on the old world bathroom! The toilet had etchings of urine around it. I was haunted by previous guests late night splashing! The hall ways had stained carpets and decor was straight out of the 1990s. We tried booking some other hotel but any of our choices were all booked up so we had to stay here. The breakfast was fine and the bed sheets clean and crisp which are the only good things I can say about this Hotel.  In conclusion if you have high standards and have stayed in proper 5 star hotels then don’t stay at the Conrad Dublin.",2,2022,06,19
209,Location !,"Wonderful location……the corner of Earlsfort Terrace and Stephens Green is perfect for anyone wanting to walk from Trinity to the canal.
We wanted to take a day to get over jetlag before 
Renting a car ( which you can do in the hotel ) and driving out of the city. 
Nice hotel, very helpful staff and good breakfast ! 
Would definitely stay here again …..",5,2022,06,19
209,Poor bar Food,"Dropped in to the Conrad for drinks in the bar and a light bite before attending the National Concert Hall this evening. My husband was served soft breadsticks with his charcuterie. This was replaced with toasted bread. I was served soft ""crackers""with my cheese and grapes. These were replaced with fresh crackers on my request. The food in the bar has definately deteriorated. Staff still very friendly and professional.",2,2022,06,13
209,Elegant yet friendly,"Lovely hotel, great location and great service. I was very pleased with the size of the room, the basic amenities, breakfast being included and the availability of parking onsite. Great 24/7 gym as well - would be useful if I wasn't there for work and had more time.  Note -  Fridge, Nespresso machine for coffee, tea, actual glasses, lotion, and conditioner all provided (these are my things :)",5,2022,06,12
209,Incredible stay,From the warm welcome to outstanding service. Highly recommend this hotel. We especially want to shout out to Sashin who we met when we arrived and decided to eat lunch at the hotel. Not only was she incredible but remembered us throughout the stay and we couldn’t have felt more welcomed. ,5,2022,06,11
209,NOT 5* or anywhere close!,"Very disappointed with our stay at he Hotel Conrad Dublin. The bedrooms were distinctly 3* - It was pointed out that the hotel will be renovated soon. My problem with that is why should I pay 5* prices for substandard accommodations! Poor food options. Pick another hotel like the Westbury or the Merrion.
That being said, the hotel is in a great location on Stephen's Green, opposite the National Concert Hall.",2,2022,06,10
209,Customer service at its best!,"Newly renovated hotel in ideal location with staff that are truly some of the best that I have ever encountered. Rooms are nicely appointed and spotless.  Attention to detail is obvious. All the front desk staff from the moment of check in went above and beyond to make sure all needs were provided for.  Breakfast was excellent and our server who was a university student on internship from the Netherlands was very attentive and personable.  If lucky enough to return to Dublin in the future, would not consider staying anywhere else.",5,2022,05,24
209,Very good,Very nice hotel. Well located. Refurbishment are very well done and gives it a fresh start. Food was ok. Better than our last stay we can say. Special thank you to the bad team for a very nice evening.,4,2022,05,22
209,Decent property but poor follow up to billing issues,"Due to a slightly unusual situation to be fair, I've had significant issues in my reservations for the partial points and cash stay for 6 nights, where the hotel is charging me for the stay vs direct billing Hilton as the reservation was originally set up.  In trying to communicate with them directly, they have not been communicating and I tried to make sure that the hotel did the billing correctly at check-in and check-out.  I've even confirmed with Hilton Guest Assistance that everything is in order but it's still unresolved because the hotel hasn't requested my cash payment from them.

The hotel itself is clean and well located, but did not get a Diamond upgrade due to 100% capacity for the first 2 nights that I was there.  The breakfast is quite good, with a continental buffet plus ordered food.  It's bit confusing since everything has an a la carte  price but was apparently included with my diamond breakfast benefit.  No lounge available.  The AirCoach stops very close to it (Lower Leeson stop on the 700 line) and is a cheap and easy way to get to/from the airport.  The gym is a. decent size and appreciated the free weights being heavy enough.",2,2022,05,20
209,Make sure to check your bank account after your stay!,"For Christmas I decided to treat my parents to two nights in the Conard hotel with dinner (plus concert tickets to André Rieu, bought separately).  I contacted the Conrad a few days prior to their arrival date and paid the agreed bill in full – I was very clear it was a gift and gentleman I dealt with helpful and efficient.  

My problems only started after my parents checked out on Saturday.  I just happened to be reviewing my bank account and noticed a charge by the Conrad hotel in the amount of €1,350 – this was over the agreed charge that had already been paid a few days earlier.  When I contacted the Conrad the level of customer service afforded to me was appalling – I was told to send an email backing up the agreed rate and the over charge of €1,350.  It was only when I was put through to Alex (Front of house manager on duty) that the seriousness of the situation seemed to dawn on staff.  Let me be clear – the agreed bill was already paid for and taken from my account days before; the €1,350 was an overcharge!  To add insult to injury my father called me on Tuesday saying that they had taken €121.95 out of his bank account… he was told at checkout that he didn’t owe anything and that the bill was paid for in full.  So, this money was taken from his account without any notification.

As I sit here typing this review, I still have not received my refund five days later!  I have been in communication with the General Manager Andrew Moore and Front of house manager John Lynch; while their apologies seem sincere and they have offered me lunch/dinner as compensation I feel that I have a duty of care to notify people of the issues I have experienced.

I find it hard to believe that my father and I are the only people this has happened to so with this in mind; to anyone who has stayed in the Conrad hotel I strongly advise that you review your bank account; anyone planning on staying there – do your due diligence, back up your agreed rate and what is to be included during your stay and make sure you review your bank account after your visit.

It is important that clarify that I have not stayed in the Conrad hotel Dublin – my experience is solely based on the purchase of a Christmas present for my parents.",1,2022,05,18
209,Conrad Dublin,"What a fabulous hotel in the city centre with large comfortable rooms, lovely food and fabulous staff 💚

 Friendly and not as pretentious as the Shelbourne, spotlessly clean and very central with St Stephens Green just metres away.

Would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2022,05,17
209,Conrad Dublin,"There isn’t a thing I can think of to recommend anything this hotel or staff could have done to make this a more enjoyable stay. Attention to detail in every way and some of the nicest people working here. The only way our next visit could match this one is to stay here again, which we will.",5,2022,05,15
209,Great Location,"We were reserved to stay for 3 nights.  We missed our connecting flight in the Atlanta and didn't make it the first night.  We called the hotel directly and to the 800 customer service number to advise our status and confirm we would still have a room when we arrive 24 hours later.  Both calls assured us the room would be available.  When we arrived, we were told we didn't have a reservation there.  After about 15 minutes of high anxiety, the reservation was found and we were given our room.  We were even credited for the night we didn't make it.  The staff was accommodating during this ordeal and assured us we would be taken care of.
The hotel is in a great location.  Easy access to park, shopping and tourist points.  Get a hop on hop off bus pass.
The hotel was was very clean and well serviced.  Staff was wonderful.
Almost 2 weeks driving around Ireland, this is the only hotel that had a US outlet.  Even though we had brought an adapter, it was convenient.",5,2022,05,12
209,Excellent Location,This is my second stay at this  great hotel that overlooks overlooks the majestic National Concert Hall -it's the perfect location to explore the city.- whether for business or leisure. The Conrad has that contemporary and yet stylish look and feel. Lemuel's whips up great cocktails and very friendly service throughout the hotel. Great value,5,2022,04,28
209,A calming hotel in Dublin,"Our stay here was nothing shy of what we expected at a Conrad property. Great size room, super friendly staff. The bathroom was a little dated but had everything you needed. Nice location with its proximity to the park. A 10-15 minute walk can get you to Temple Bar area. If you're looking to enjoy the various aspects of Dublin city life but don't want to be at the center this is for you.",5,2022,04,27
209,Birthday breakfast,"Today we went to Coburg restaurant, to have a breakfast. We were a group of 12, our colleague had a birthday.  The waitress Melanie surprised him with a birthday plate and a Mimosa cocktail. She anticipated our needs at the table, we had a great experience thanks to her.",5,2022,04,25
209,"Amazing property, top notch service","In my opinion this is THE PLACE to stay while traveling to Dublin. The hotel is beautiful, the staff knowledgable and accommodating, the food was top notch. I also loved the location, right near the magnificent St Stephens Green and the shopping at Grafton St but tucked into a quiet street. We were able to walk to most of the major attractions from the hotel. The rooms were spacious and pretty, modern while still being traditional. The service was beyond amazing, the staff made sure that they were available to answer any questions or provide recommendations. I've stayed at other high end hotels in Dublin but this is the one I will return to. I highly recommend!",5,2022,04,25
209,Great modern hotel,"I stayed in the hotel at the beginning of this month when attending a conference in Dublin castle, and I must say - WOW! The hotel smell gorgeous, everything is so new and clean but what stands out the most is the people. The team in the breakfast room and the bar went out of their way to make sure we feel comfortable. One of the girl in the Terrace noticed that I am drinking Hendrick's gin and she offered me to try Gunpowder which is her favorite Irish gin on the house. The girl at breakfast remembered me from the day before and offered me the same table. I will recommend this hotel to everyone and I can't wait to go back.",5,2022,04,21
209,Lovely near the Park,"Booked a last minute long weekend getaway to Dublin through Amex Platinum and landed at the Conrad. I must say I was pleasantly surprised throughout my entire stay. When we arrived early from the states and the room was not ready, the front desk was extremely welcoming and offered us beverages and held our luggage. The lobby was marble and very bright, open and inviting. We wondered a few blocks away and got lost in the gorgeous St Stephens Green and had a lovely brunch at The Grayson, but that’s for a separate review. As we were finishing brunch we received a call from the hotel that the room was ready and offered to send us a taxi. It was a sunny day and we decided to walk back. We checked in and were given an upgraded king room on the top floor with a nice view towards the park and in the distance you could see the mountains. There was a bottle of wine and truffles accompanied by a note welcoming us to the hotel. It was really a lovely touch that you don’t see too often at 5* properties post-Covid. I really appreciated the spaciousness of the room considering most rooms in Europe are quite small. There were some really nice touches throughout the room, including a US 110v outlet in the desk.  The bed was comfortable and the linens were Frette (or very similar) and gorgeous. The bathroom was marble with a deep tub perfect for warming up after the chill of the Irish wind. Booking through Amex awarded us a hotel credit as well as complimentary breakfast daily. We used the voucher in the hotel bar each night - very warm and cozy to relax before turning in. They make an excellent Irish Coffee and Hot Whisky, can’t be missed. The breakfast had the option of the menu or buffet - or a combo. The options were commendable and a perfect way to start the early morning before heading out for a long day of tours. The hotel was built in the 1980’s and was renovated a few years back  and they’re ramping up for the potential of another large reno (according to the concierge) but no plans have been solidified. Honestly, for a city hotel the Conrad is perfect. The location is away from the hustle of central tourist district that can be a little extra, but close enough that you can get a good walk in without becoming exhausted. It’s also not The Shelbourne where every tourist is wondering around the lobby taking pictures - that doesn’t sound fun to me. The Conrad hotel is spotlessly clean, modern and the details that you come to expect at a 5* by Hilton hotel are definitely there.",5,2022,04,20
209,Fantastic from start to finish,"Stayed at the Conrad for few days to celebrate the misses birthday.
From the second we walked in the Conrad the staff were amazing.
The young chap who checked us in was very helpful and made us feel special.
They even delivered to our room chocolates and strawberry for her with happy birthday on it.
Breakfast was great and fully stocked, again staff were first class.
I cannot find anything negative to say about the Conrad and if we come back to Dublin it’s where we would stay.",5,2022,04,16
209,Better five star options available in Dublin,"I have already discussed with the manager who has addressed my concerns and provided some explanations but in general the hotel is not up to a five star standard that we usually get with Fine Hotels and Resorts. I am also a Hilton Diamond member and commented to John that the standard at the Doubletree in London in February 2022 exceeded the standard at the Conrad. I have stayed in many hotels during Covid and have not been greeted with paper cups and no glasses at all. We requested water and wine glasses which were delivered and not changed once during our stay- dirty glasses just left on the counter. Towels were not folded and toiletries not replaced. We had to phone down to get milk and replacement coffee pods! All in all house keeping needs some serious retraining. 

We had planned to use our FHR credits on dinner in the hotel but found that the restaurant was closed so the only choice (or lack thereof) was to eat at the Terrace cafe. We elected our last night to get room service due to early departure and poor alternative choice. The food was better as room service food which at least came hot and well presented. 

All in all this hotel should not be included in FHR and I will provide them with that feedback. We could have stayed at the Shelbourne or Merrion for our last two nights but decided to stay at The Conrad- I am sorry we did!",2,2022,04,13
209,Excellent,"Myself and my partner stayed in the Conrad for one night in April.
My father and his wife were also in my party. It was my Dad's 70th birthday and the night was birthday gift for him. I had let the hotel know in advance, they really made him feel special with the gifts in his room and when we ate in the Terrace restaurant. 
Thank you to all the staff who were exceptional from check in/out, also  to staff in the restaurant for dinner and breakfast.",5,2022,04,12
209,Great hospitality,"John at the front desk helped us our whole stay!! Thanks for all your suggestions and all your help!

Great location personally we did not want to be right on temple bar area so we choose this hotel and we are so happy we did!

We can’t wait to come back!",5,2022,04,10
209,Kind service and great quality,"Upon arrival me and my partner were made feel at home in this hotel. Checkin was incredibly efficient and we were super impressed with our room.
Staff at dinner and breakfast were really great at what they do, I could not flaw any member of staff here.",5,2022,03,23
209,Excellent!,"My wife and I just spent three lovely nights at the Conrad hotel.  The room was great, quiet, and comfortable, the breakfast excellent, and the hotel's location -- just a stone's throw from St. Stephen's Green in the heart of Dublin -- extremely convenient to see the city on foot.

We really want to commend the staff of the hotel who were without exception helpful, kind, and friendly.  Special thanks goes to Sashin, who works in the restaurant, greeted us cheerfully each morning, and who was an utter joy to talk to and a fabulous representative of the hotel.

We had a great stay and will most definitely return.",5,2022,03,22
209,St Patrick Days week ,"My sister and I stayed here the week of St Patrick's day. The hotels location is great. We were able to walk to various local pubs and restaurants.  The staff was very friendly and helpful with suggestions where we could eat,drink, or shop. We looked forward to our daily made-to-order breakfast.",5,2022,03,22
209,Wonderful hotel,"The Conrad Dublin provided more than just fine accommodations, they provided an experience. Every part of our stay was well thought out by the hotel staff. Breakfast was excellent each day of our trip and a to-go breakfast was ready for us the morning of our very early departure. I also highly recommend their Irish coffee from the bar!",5,2022,03,21
209,Amazing stay,"It was wonderful as always, great food, great staff, lovely atmosphere for St. Paddys day. Service has improved s lot since our last visit and we can’t wait to come back. Hopefully, the main restaurant will be open by then.",5,2022,03,20
209,Flawless Experience,"The Conrad Dublin is the perfect example of a 5 star hotel. The restaurants, bar, location, rooms, and hospitality are flawless. We paid for an upgrade to a Conrad Suite and it was well worth the extra investment. Having 2 rooms allowed us to spread out and have a living room to visit and plan our days. The best feature that cannot be fully described is the people. They were professional, kind, and so friendly. Our favorites were Jessica (at the front desk), Caroline and Fran (Servers in the restaurants and bar), plus the superstar Kat. Kat anticipated our every need and went out of her way to make our special requests happen. Conrad, you have an amazing property and you should be proud.",5,2022,03,19
209,Spectacular service,"I stayed here for 4 nights with my small dog. First of all, my communications with the hotel prior to my arrival were all quick and efficient. On the day, I arrived 2 hours prior to check in but they were able to allow me to my room which I appreciated very much. Every member of staff I met seemed genuinely happy and willing to help. Always smiling and say hello etc 

On one occasion I was struggling in the car park below the hotel with the elevator and a gentleman (not sure which department) stepped in and helped me and went above and beyond to get me new room
Keys cut and came with me to test them in my room door too. 

The housekeeping staff were friendly and did an amazing job with little touches. The Pet package set up Was really incredible (bowls, bed, treats, poo bags, do Not disturb sign) and I really recommend staying here with your dog as it’s near the park but the rate for a dog is not only steep but not clear on the website if it’s per night or total. I questioned this and the hotel satisfactorily and quickly resolved the matter. 

My only bit of constructive feedback was that the pizza I had from room service was not very nice at all.

The room was everything I needed and super comfortable bed and I shall definitely be staying here again. Thank you to the whole team. You made my Dublin trip. Thank you.",5,2022,03,17
209,A bland experience,"Very convenient hotel and clean - but when you enter a lounge in Ireland on a 6 nations day you expect a tele - but no not in the Conrad -unbelievable- 

The bedroom was fine - but a poor hand shower with no variation in power pressure - getting out of the shower was dangerous it’s quiet a drop to get out - also which was quite unusual no brush to sanitise the toilet 

The tele in the bedroom had no sky sports unusually frustrating for a 5 star hotel 

The breakfast was fine - the knives and forts were tiny and most of my scramble egg ended on the floor - there were a lack of choice of juices and the layout of the breakfast was too tight - frankly I won’t return for the breakfast alone - 

After all of that it is probably worth a return at some time forward",2,2022,03,13
209,Great Location and Outstanding Hospitality,"This hotel is located near the St. Stephen's Green Park, and many other tourist attractions in Dublin city.  A walking distance to the shopping area at Grafton Street and to the Dublin Castle. 
The restaurant onsite serves delicious food. My favorite is their dessert, ""pistachio cake.""  It's a must try. I had it on the first night, and had to have it again before leaving Ireland.  So we also ordered the pistachio cake on the night before we checked out. 
The front desk are always ready to help. We had daily day tours that we had to leave so early and miss breakfast.  The front desk provided us with breakfast to go so that we have something to eat.  
Our room smelled delightful. We always had a good night sleep. 
The turn down service is amazing too. Temperature was lowered and beds ready for our slumber, while leaving chocolates to ensure we have sweet dreams.  
We truly enjoyed the hospitality and we will surely try to stay there again on our next visit to Dublin.",5,2022,03,11
209,Excellent Hotel in a great location,"We really enjoyed our stay.  Staff and customer service were impeccable.  Very cute hotel, in the lobby and the rooms.  Breakfast was super and we really liked the bar.  Very stylish, very friendly.  We were leaving early in the morning, they prepared us a cutest togo breakfast",5,2022,03,06
209,Excellent hôtel,"Great location. 
Very close to the major museums and attractions and next to Green Park. Easy access from the airport by bus if needed.
Jessica at the reception is excellent at what she does. Very attentive 
Melanie at the breakfast is also very engaging",5,2022,02,22
209,Great stay in Conrad Dublin,"From the moment we arrived at the hotel, the professionalism, attention and friendliness from all the staff was apparent. Check in was smooth. The reservations/ front office desk was very helpful pre-and during the stay and showed a genuine interest in making our stay memorable  (I would like to thank Lucy in particular). As diamond Hilton member, we had complimentary breakfast and we were upgraded into a suite, which was lovely.

Excellent room, luxuriously designed, quiet (no street/neighbouring room noise, however the air condition was rather noisy) and modern. Everything looks (and is) classy but traditional at the same time. 

The hotel is not cheap (as expected from a premium Conrad hotel) but the value makes more than worth it. A suggestion: If only there was an executive lounge, I think it would fit to the ambience of the hotel. Overall, from start to finish we had a great stay and I would really recommend this hotel. We will return soon.",5,2022,02,15
209,Nice Hotel,"Stayed there recently for the first time in approx 15 years. This is still a nice hotel, but the interior decor and rooms are starting to get a little bit dated now. The restaurant is ok, nothing special to write home about but the breakfast is excellent. All staff were excellent and very helpful",4,2022,01,18
209,5 stars in every way,"I was in Dublin for work and stayed at the Conrad for 1 night. I was loved the bar. The drinks selection is truly world class. The brassiere served delicious meal. Breakfast was good. I liked the fact that they serve proper coffee for breakfast and not the sub-standard one as many hotels seem to do these days.
 Can’t go wrong with Conrad.",5,2022,01,10
209,Festive Breakfast,"Pre pandemic my family have been going to the Conrad for breakfast every Christmas Eve for about 10 years now and without a doubt this year was the most impressive and enjoyable experience to date.  The restaurant décor following the refurb is beautiful and the food quality and buffet presentation was top notch.

Above all I was blown away with the service.    The staff were incredibly patient and understanding with all members of the party.  A particular mention to Melanie who went above and beyond with the numerous tea pot refills we consumed and went out of her way to make our younger guests feel like VIPs.  We were all blown away by her service and are still talking about how genuine and caring she was.  Our breakfast at the Conrad was certainly a highlight of Christmas for me.",5,2022,01,04
209,Night away,"Very nice stay with lovely staff & a nice clean room. Very good range of drinks and food on offer, we enjoyed our short stay & the location is great for central Dublin activity’s. Car parking was very handy at this location.",4,2021,12,30
209,Fabulous Family Christmas at The Conrad Dublin,"My family chose The Conrad Dublin as the venue for a special three day Christmas holiday and it exceeded all expectations. In the first instance, the staff have to be commended highly, from working directly with us when booking our multiple accommodations and Christmas Lunch but also  everyone we dealt with throughout our stay contributed towards making our family Christmas unforgettable.",5,2021,12,30
209,Dreadful Customer Service,"Impossible to contact them.  Have emailed and called to question why I was charged on my card almost double for the room.  The room itself was not very smart, definitely not premium.  I stayed there so I could park my car underneath, but at almost 300 Euro it was not worth it. - And then a phantom charge over 200 Euro was added.  I emailed them, called them and was fobbed off every time.  Never once have they responded.  The chain is too big - there is no personal service.  It is like dealing with a Government department.",1,2021,12,21
209,Weekend trip to visit our daughter at Trinity,"The Conrad was very clean and comfortable, with good dining provision. Its central location was very convenient for Trinity College and all of Dublin’s main attractions, while still being quiet. The staff were all friendly and welcoming.  ",5,2021,12,14
209,Family reunion after 2 years,"I experienced the best customer service during our breakfast, to be honest this Conrad is offering you a 5 star experience adapted to Ireland standards, big thanks to Caroline, she  made my day and from unhappy turned me into a very happy customer when she brought my order the way I like it,this hotel is so lucky to have an employee like Caroline, well done and will be back for sure! Thanks",5,2021,12,11
209,Is this really a Conrad?,"As Lifetime Diamond I had many stays, among Conrad hotels all over the world, so I can compare. This hotel let my down in many ways.

Usually for a Conrad hotel I receive 5-7 days before arrival an e-mail with information and assistance etc. Here not, so 3 day before arrival I send an e-mail with all my details, confirmation number and dates. I wrote if a reservation for the restaurant was necessary and if so, I would like to make one on the day of my arrival, including date and time, for the Terrace restaurant, and the following day, including date and time, for a High Tea to celebrate my birthday.

It took 24 hours to respond to my mail and they let a trainee do the job. She only sent me the usual general hotel information. Underneath the food and beverage section it was stated that I had to inform the hotel if I want to make a reservation (???) and for a High Tea it is essential to make a phone call…………………(???) So, I had to answer this mail with again details of my restaurant requests.

Upon arrival there is no assistance outside to help with luggage. I had already seen in my Hilton App that I only got an upgrade to a Premium room (without view), although all other higher level rooms and suites were available. At the front desk I was assisted by a friendly woman, but she was not in the position to give me a better room, not even on a higher floor. 

I had a proper coffee machine in my room, but only paper cups. I still cannot believe this, even in Covid times I’ve never experienced that in all my other stays, not even in Hampton Inns. For my Birthday I received a plate with Happy Birthday written in chocolate with 2 tiny macarons. Luckily the nice front office employee managed, after serious requests of mine, to give me a Conrad bear for my collection.

The entrance to the Terrace restaurant is in the basement. They could find my reservation, but I was offered a table in the dark section of the restaurant next to the bar. There were 3 or 4 tables, not occupied, so I would sit there on my own. On both sides there are steps to the section on street level, with large windows and view to an outside patio and terrace. Only half of the tables there were taken and I asked if I could sit there. This was refused, because all tables were reserved (!). After asking another employee, I could, to my relief, move upstairs. During the time of my dinner, there still remained some empty tables.

The High Tea would be served in the Lemuel’s restaurant. I arrived 5 minutes before the confirmed time in an empty restaurant. I waited 10 minutes, no one there, before I went to the front desk to ask about my High Tea. I had to wait another 5 minutes, before an employee arrived. I said to her that I didn’t want to sit in a large empty restaurant on my one and wanted to move to the Terrace restaurant. I took another 5 minutes before I got approval to go downstairs to have my High Tea in a nicer setting with some people around.

The breakfast was fine, some things to be ordered and a buffet selection to be picked up by an employee. The first morning when I asked for coffee, I was given very good coffee in a so called Cafetiere. The second morning, a Sunday, with other staff working, I was automatically given an americano, while others guests still were given the Cafetiere. Also all other guests got a Sunday paper as well, I was not even asked if I wanted one.

All those incidents piled up, I find it very hard to believe this happened to me because I am a female solo traveler, but it is certainly not the Conrad standard of hospitality and service.",1,2021,12,11
209,Great hotel and location,"Great property, I found it a good value. The location was a short walk tons of dining and shopping but far enough away that it was very peaceful around the hotel. Front desk staff was great, very proactive. The property overall was well kept up, everything felt new. I found breakfast a little underwhelming but overall a great hotel.",5,2021,12,09
209,Rip-off place - avoid,"I booked this hotel through their reservation department, being guaranteed best price, end up finding out I was over charged 110e per night . I was trying to resolve this issue, but totally unhelpful and unprofessional management team is only a waste of time! Have to engage with Irish Consumer Protection organisation to find a solution. Please avoid this place all you can!!",1,2021,12,06
209,Lovely anniversary stay,I have been to the Conrad a few times and every time I go there I remember why I rate it so highly. I was here to celebrate 20 years together with my wife. We were upgraded to a better room (thanks in part to my Hilton membership status) and there some lovely anniversary touches in the room. Staff were as always attentive and professional- a credit to the hotel. We had fantastic cocktails in the bar- which had a lovely atmosphere. I am not sure why but the main restaurant was closed but we ate in the Terrace which was a good meal- more relaxed than I would have liked but the food was of good quality- I do feel the hotel needs to have the main restaurant open though as it feels more special. Breakfast was top notch- fantastic quality and lots of options. Room modern spacious and very much to my taste. I will continually return to this hotel- one of my favs and lots of memories created every time we stay there. Highly recommended,5,2021,12,05
209,Just an amazing place to stay!,"The location is fantastic for a stay in Dublin, the rooms are beyond comfortable, with everything you could possibly need, the staff are second to none with Customer Service and just the overall stay was perfect.",5,2021,11,21
209,"Outstanding hotel, great location","Conrad Dublin is an outstanding hotel in a superb location  just off Stephen's Green and situated in the heart of one of the the Dublin business areas.  Sophisticated and contemporary design, not an old Georgian structure so perhaps not for some but the best choice for people seeking a modern hotel.",5,2021,11,20
209,Amazing Stay,We had an absolutely amazing time staying here at the Conrad. The staff here are extremely kind and helpful. The location is great and the room was very comfortable. We definitely would stay here again when we are back in Dublin next. We didn't have time to try out the restaurant here but that is definitely going to be on our to do when we return.,5,2021,11,19
209,"Mixed experience , lacks warmth and atmosphere compared to other hotels.","A decent  hotel (see positives)  but Feels like a hotel Lacking warmth and atmosphere with food a concern. Most hotels have xmas decorations up in Dublin and in full spirit. 
Conrad plays xmas songs without any xmas decor.Staff didnt know if and when  decor was happening so again all seemingly disconnected .

Food was very poor as passionate decent chefs and servers would never attempt to send out what they did and constantly wrong orders.

Breakfast - wrong order , wait time then rock hard bacon , greasy sausages , toast not toasted  .Very poor and careless. 

Dinner at Terrace - kids meal burnt,  black clearly burnt rock hard goujons served and sent back.  Another wrong order -Tomato soup sent instead of coconut and sweet potato without advising. Large main Salad that was small , tasteless and uninspiring . 
Burger felt like defrosted and tasteless. 
Compared to Westbury previous night there was no comparison in food. Staff addressed and bill waived but our last night spoilt overall. 

Positives 
Good friendly staff especially Regan in Terrace , good check in , spotless clean , opulent bars and restaurant in design ,  great central location , very quiet area , rooms nothing special but comfortable and great beds. 

 Negatives
As above ,  food very poor , 3 star uninspiring bathrooms. 

Overall
Not quite 5 star cohesive Conrad on this occasion. Still worth staying at right deal but not versus some of the other 5 stars in Dublin.",4,2021,11,17
209,Comfortable stay at outstanding property,"As Diamond members we received a room upgrade, and our breakfast was included. Both were appreciated. The downstairs bar/restaurant served great food and drink. We felt that health and safety standards were well maintained. Thank you!",5,2021,11,15
209,5 star stay!,From the moment we stepped into this hotel it was fabulous. Our check in agent was wonderful. Welcomed us upgraded and provided vouchers for breakfast and drinks since the lounge was closed and my husband is a diamond member. He walked us to elevator and made us feel welcome and valued. Very impressive. They room was clean and comfortable. Drinks in bar were delicious service great. Breakfast was wonderful. Only criticism was that 1 of the elevator was broken and this given the current covid situation was slow and unpleasant. Will definitely choose this hotel again and I am picky!,5,2021,11,06
209,Excellent staff,"The staff are very professional and friendly.  Rooms we cleaned daily, and the facilities were always very clean.  The food is a little expensive but was delicious.  The hotel is also located in a nice part of the city.",5,2021,11,03
209,Incredible Hotel and lovely Staffs .,"An extreamly pleasant hotel experience here at the Conrad hotel to celebrate my Anniversary. Staff were very helpful and front of house were extremely professional. We found the hotel lobby to be a real eye catcher! We stayed in the Superior king sized room which was a perfect choice, immaculate clean and very well appointed. We had lunch and  dinner at the Terrace restaurant was superb, food was A1. I would also like to point out that Regan was our Waitress which was was to the to the highest order of professional but also extreamly friendly! We followed up with an evening of cocktails in the bar joined by friends where everyone was extreamly pleased with the cosy setting of the bar, made everyone feel very comfortable and at home. Breakfast the next morning was a delight, stephen and another woman serviced us, I’m annoyed with myself I can’t recall her name but a she was so lovely and friendly, a woman with a short bob, both made it a lovely experience for us both with a large range of food to choose from and a mimosa to celebrate. I Would highly recommend this hotel to friends and family, we will definitely be back. Thankyou Conrad staff for a wonderful stay.",5,2021,11,03
209,Perfect stay at the Conrad Dublin,"A wonderful hotel experience.  Staff were very helpful and extremely courteous. The breakfast was excellent with a great choice of food.  Dinner at the Terrace restaurant was superb - quality of food was top notch.  Parking was very simple and arranged by the staff including letting me charge my electric car overnight in the EV charging spot in the garage.  The adjoining family rooms were excellent, perfectly clean and very well appointed.  We will definitely be back.  Thankyou Conrad staff for a wonderful stay.",5,2021,10,31
209,Nice hotel,"Lovely hotel with a nice feel but certainly not 5 star. Enjoyable amenities and a great location for St Stephen’s Green, Grafton Street and Wexford St. The restaurant is it’s only downfall. It’s a grand restaurant but not 5 star quality. ",4,2021,10,30
209,Best hotel in the City.,"The Conrad was always a lovely hotel to stay in, but with its recent refurbishment and new (young and enthusiastic) management team, it has just got even better.
Always having the reputation of a fine business hotel, it is now a strong contender for best family hotel in the City also.
If I’m in town, either on business, or with the family, you’ll find me at the Conrad.",5,2021,10,29
209,Wonderful hotel,"The Conrad Dublin is a great hotel with a super location.  Easy walk to St Stephens Green and then Grafton Street.  The hotel staff is very nice and more than willing to help out with whatever you may need.  

The breakfast is either buffet or made to order, whichever you prefer.  

If possible, upgrade to a Junior Suite...it is well worth the extra money because you get a lot more room.",5,2021,10,22
209,Consistently excellent ,"Plenty of parking space at reasonable overnight price (for Dublin), consistently helpful and polite staff and even basic rooms are luxurious. Great location for a stroll through St Stephen’s Green and on to Grafton St. The only slight fault I can find is the the size of the restaurant tables, too small for all the plates, masks, phones etc. Lots of hand sanitiser and staff are Covid savvy. Worth the extra cost for top of the range Hilton.",5,2021,10,16
209,Business & pleasure in Dublin,"Excellent location - short walk to fabulous restaurants, shopping and city attractions. Wonderful staff - from the first plans at greeting to the heart- felt farewell at departure, all were helpful and attentive to my needs and comfort. Delicious breakfast!",5,2021,10,09
209,Lovely Hotel & Perfect Location,"The Conrad is a lovely hotel. The entrance lobby is beautifully designed and gives a very opulent feeling. All front of house staff are professional and friendly. We stayed as a party of 5 and had three rooms. Each room had everything one could want and the beds were extremely comfortable.
The location of the hotel is excellent for discovering the best of Dublin City.
The only let down for us was the service we received when we visited both bars. It was very slow and staff gave me the impression that they were new and required more training.
Overall we had a lovely stay and would return.",4,2021,10,06
209,Pathetic Service,"Always loved a drink in the hotel lounge going there now for over 15 years live locally. Approached bar to order drink and was told to sit and I will be served at my table. Nothing wrong with that but it was the manner in which it was said. Anyway was eventually served lounge was not very busy at this time. My partner noticed the lounge girl was under pressure seemed unable to cope. Another girl came to her aid and both went about in a mindless uncoordinated way trying to serve the guests. The two girls in question seemed to be totally unapologetic for the slow nonchalant attitude they displayed.

We tried a number of times to order another drink but our signals were ignored so I approached counter again fully masked and was told to sit again and I will be served. However the two continued to go about perusing their tasks oblivious to the plight of their customers. We decided it was in our best interests to leave and approached the counter again and asked for our bill. We were then told that our order was prepared and I responded by stating that I did not order anything I merely wanted another drink but now decided to leave I offered no reason. 

I settled my bill and the attitude displayed by the bar girl was aggressive, uncaring and rude. We both decided that our much loved little retreat was no more and that we vowed never to return again to be abused in this manner by two brain dead service providers.",2,2021,10,01
209,Nice hotel in good location,"The Conrad is a very nice hotel in a good location. You are not in the middle of everything but that's not always a bad thing! It's about a 10 - 15 minute walk to get to the center of Dublin, depending on where you want to go. Dublin's not that big though so easy enough to get around. The service was very friendly, from the front desk to the restaurant. The room was a little warm and were told the A/C didn't go below 16C (60.8 F) but it didn't feel like it was blowing that cold. We did call and got some fans which helped. I guess we shouldn't expect cold A/C in Ireland! Overall we enjoyed our experience there. We've stayed there before and probably will again.",5,2021,09,28
209,Perfect Hotel for Dublin Visit,"We stayed at the Conrad Hilton for our most recent visit to Dublin. The hotel was wonderful and I would highly recommend it. It is in a very convenient location to downtown Dublin. The hotel is modern, clean with a variety of restaurants. The staff was professional and very friendly.",5,2021,09,25
209,Good quality ,"Good quality business hotel in the heart of Dublin. Everything to a very high standard without being top-end deluxe. Good room size, strong aircon, plug points and coffee machine. Room felt refurbished and fresh. Breakfast was ok but unexceptional.",4,2021,09,17
209,"Brilliant Staff, Lovely Facilities and Super Location","Although the hotel has little curb appeal, once I crossed the threshold the staff and facilities won me over!  I stayed for three nights in early September.  The hotels Covid19 procedures were significant, but never made me feel put out.  The included breakfast quality and variety were excellent with a buffet and and ala carte orders both included.  I had lunch and dinner at the Terrace restaurant downstairs which were both excellent.  I particularly recommend the Buddha bowl.",5,2021,09,09
209,Highly recommend. A reliably great hotel experience.,"I spent 13 nights at The Conrad during a recent visit to Dublin. I’ve stayed here before and will stay here again, it is a reliably great experience. I particularly like that this hotel is conveniently located just across from Stephen’s Green but is not In a hectic or noisy area (as The Shelbourne and Westbury are). So it is peaceful and quiet in the evening. Beds and pillows are great, staff is super friendly, breakfast is yummy and worth including in your room rate. For Americans, note that there are many USB ports and one Us style electrical outlet relieving the need to bring adapters and chargers, As Dublin comes out of lockdown, there are challenges with service staff everywhere but it’s testimony to the quality of this hotel and its management that it’s well staffed now. My room was  serviced throughly and timely and there was always a staff person there to help when needed. On my last morning all of the staff have greeted me and wished me well and encouraged me to return soon. I certainly will!",5,2021,09,09
209,Incredible hotel!,"10/10 would recommend. Location was excellent as it’s right in town next to St. Stephens Green, staff were amazing, bedding is so comfy, and food was excellent. The breakfast was perfect - so many choices of excellent food!",5,2021,09,07
209,Lovely Hotel,"Spent two nights here whilst on a weekend in Dublin. I've stayed here previously but I think the hotel has had a light refresh since my last visit. It's a lovely hotel and well positioned for walking into town for shopping and eating.
Highlights are the definitely the staff who look like they're really well trained and genuinely understand great service. Nothing ever feels like too much trouble and they're always eager to help.
We had drinks in the Terrace with some nibbles which was nice, especially as the weather was good and also had breakfast at the hotel which was also good quality with a strong choice.
If I was the criticise anything then maybe the audio/visual facilities in the rooms could be better. Our TV had lots of ""missing"" stations - I wasn't too bothered as I didn't come to Dublin to watch TV, but it's a small annoyance and a hotel of this class could refresh their connection options with a refreshed AV offer (Mirror casting, etc).
Can't wait to return.",5,2021,09,07
209,GREAT HOTEL WITH A FEW LINGERING LOCKDOWN ISSUES,"Beautiful room, superb breakfast with great staff, and a lovely cocktail bar. Just a few lingering minor issues that were probably due to the last dying breaths of the Irish lockdown restrictions, IE no bell boys or concierge staff so we had to haul our own luggage, and for £400.00 a night that is not acceptable. Also the evening restaurant in the basement terrace has a very limited food choice. burgers/ wings/ fish n chips etc. not really up to the job. I assume the restaurant on the ground floor where breakfast is served will re-open at some point as the main evening restaurant. We would stay again though in the future after all this COVID stuff has ended. ",4,2021,09,06
209,"Conrad Dublin, good location and all the amenities you expect .",This is a very good hotel with all the amenities you expect. The location is very good and within walking distance of most activities. The staff was very helpful. The breakfast is very good. I liked it partially because it is more of a business hotel.,4,2021,09,05
209,Business Focused but great for tourists also,"Spent 4 nights at the Conrad while in Ireland. Great spot, nice clean rooms, good view. This is a bit more of a business hotel it seems, perfect for our tourist visit because it was not busy at the hours we were using the hotel. 
Nice gym, two full weight sets up to 22kg dumbbells. Full dual cable machine, technogym leg curl, leg extension, chest press, and an elliptical, row machine, and treadmills. Adjustable benches. Hood enough for anyone to get a lift in. 

I preferred this hotel because it was a bit off St.Stephen’s Green, a bit out of the way, but super close to every place you’d want to go. 

My only complaints would be that the coffee shop wasn’t open early (nespresso machine in room), and one of the cables in the gym had a carabiner that was not weight rated for the machine (will fail at some point) but that would be if I was searching for something negative to say. 

Would come again!",5,2021,09,05
209,Perfect 🤩,"Very welcoming staff , super helpful and nice, perfect location and the rooms were so relaxing , room service and food was on point! Book it , you  will not have any regrets, make sure to order some pancakes for breakfast !!!",5,2021,09,03
209,5 star stay in the heart of Dublin,"Lovely visit to the Conrad over the weekend. Staff were extremely friendly, the rooms were lovely and spacious and very fresh looking. From a Covid compliance perspective it felt extremely clean. I had breakfast room service it was very tasty and came quickly. I went down for breakfast the following morning and staff were very efficient and food was delicious. Really looking forward to going back soon.",4,2021,08,30
209,"Forget AAA, this has BBB - great Bed, great Breakfast and great Bar !","Stayed here for 3 nights as a city break visit from London. 

The location pretty good although it is a 20 min. walk to the Temple Bar area but very pleasant and no issue at all.

Our room was lovely, clean, and with a really comfortable bed and a proper coffee machine. Only slight disappointment was the shower over the bath - why do hotels even still do this? Although I have to admit it was the best over the bath shower I can remember.

Breakfast was excellent - their full Irish grabbed us - nothing out of the ordinary in terms of contents, just great quality products prepared well. What more do you need to set you up for a day in Dublin?

We did check out the bar one evening ordering cocktails and these were also very good. 

Everything was clean and efficient and all of the staff were helpful and professional as you would expect at a Conrad.

Overall, happy to recommend this hotel as you’ll be guaranteed a great stay.",5,2021,08,26
209,A warm welcome at the Conrad,"A great stay at this luxurious hotel made extra special by the warmth and kindness of the staff.Deepu and Charbel were more than welcoming on arrival.Our suite was flawless and so relaxing and comfortable with stunning views of NCH.Lucy on reception showed great kindness and the staff in the lounge were very hospitable.
Breakfast was delicious and service friendly and efficient.James ,the concierge was very helpful and personable.
The Conrad is in a fantastic location and allows easy access to restaurants,shopping and attractions while allowing a peaceful stay with Iveagh gardens and St Stephens green so close by.",5,2021,08,22
209,Great city break,"Have recently spent 2 days at the Conrad, very fast check in. The room was clean snd comfortable.
The breakfast was great and the hotel staff were all 
So friendly and helpful. 
It’s a 10 minute easy walk to Grafton street so really good for shopping. I would definitely recommend.",5,2021,08,18
209,Unorganized,We booked through Amex Platinum Fine Hotel & resorts . We communicated with hotel staff week before arrival . The date checked in . The person at the front desk had no clue of prior conversations . No room upgrade and we had to wait over 90 minutes for the room after a long flight . It took them almost 30 minutes to bring out luggages . Very disappointing experience so far .,3,2021,08,18
209,"A little ordinary from the outside, but super comfortable inside","Took my kids for a spot of fine living, we were upgraded, treated wonderfully. The hotel is a bit strange in that it has clearly been an ok hotel that has been properly spruced up. I did wonder if visitors used to the top end hotels in big cities and resorts might be a little confused this is a 5*. But we had a fine time.",4,2021,08,14
209,Excellent choice!,"Perfect location, excellent service and great breakfast! The room amenities and features were luxurious and every little detail has the guests' comfort in mind. Convenient parking underground very near Trinity. Pleasant and friendly staff and the easiest and pleasant check in I have had. Highly recommend!",5,2021,08,08
209,Great hotel great location,"Stayed in this hotel with my teenage daughter when we were on a shopping trip to Dublin. Everything was great, rooms, service, food and location. Very central and easy to walk to shops, restaurants etc. Also very close to the National Gallery and National Thestre. Would highly recommend.",5,2021,08,08
209,Lovely relaxing stay,Lovely relaxing stay first weekend away after COVID all protocols followed and felt very safe totally enjoyed this hotel so much all staff very welcoming and friendly dined in The Terrace Restaurant/Bar which was lovely I would highly recommend this hotel ,5,2021,08,05
209,Not good,"We stayed for one night, not a good experience for a so called 5* hotel. Upon arrival the girl at the desk was not overly friendly at all and looked at us like we nearly shouldn’t of been there. We thought our stay would only cost €260 and ended up costing €340 and the charge of €50 incase any damage was done to the room on top of the fee of the room itself with no notice was ridiculous. We had dinner in the terrace which was below average, portions are ridiculously small. Staff were totally unfriendly in the restaurant apart from one man who was very well mannered and polite. Our room was also below par the vent is basically hanging off the wall and the bath had black marks all over the inside of it. I have stayed here before and it was fantastic, it really has gone down hill. Staff have little to no manners or people skills, very disappointed and will not ever be back.",2,2021,08,02
209,Disappointing!,"So I haven’t even completed my stay yet. I’m waiting to check in. On arrival at this seemingly 5 star hotel. The concierge guy was fantastic! Friendly, welcoming but sadly that’s where it ended. The first thing the check in staff said was ‘your rooms not ready yet’. I replied with ‘hello’ that’s fine, I am early! He told me to go for a walk and when I asked about somewhere to eat and get a drink he replied ‘it’s closed’ but you can walk into town! Seriously!? I am a HH silver card holder and booked this hotel for an initial 2 nights with a view to extend to 12 but given the decidedly frosty welcome, I will without a doubt be taking my business elsewhere. Such a shame!",1,2021,08,01
209,Fabulous visit to the Conrad Dublin in Ireland,"We had a fabulous experience while staying at the hotel. We were extremely impressed with how clean the rooms were, how comfortable the beds were, The extent that they had gone to to make sure everything was extra safe and clean due to Covid restrictions. The morning breakfast was simply fabulous. The parking accommodations were easy and simple in and out. I was so impressed to see the general manager actually busing tables during the breakfast shift each morning. Overall it was a fabulous experience and something we would definitely do again.",5,2021,07,31
209,Wonderful service!,"My family spent one night this past weekend at this beautiful hotel.  We had adjoining rooms to accommodate our two teens.  The hotel was clean, but the service was most memorable.  Little touches like the hot chocolate delivery for the kids/chocolates for the adults on arrival were most-appreciated.  I liked that the rooms were sealed and all surfaces sanitized, fresh masks and hand wipes were even available in each room.  It is a short walk to shopping on Grafton st and directly across from st Stephens green, which is lovely during the day, but definitely more seedy in the evening, but with an obvious police presence.   The hotel dining (outside patio, which is lovely) was amazing also, as was the indoor bar, which we had to ourselves.   Will stay again if in the area!",5,2021,07,29
209,Very Impressed,"We visit Dublin often but this was our first visit here. I suspect we will be back again! From Shane helping to plan our visit in the time of COVID to superb maid service to Reagan's help in the Terrace, we had a marvelous visit. (Also the mixologist at the Terrace is well experienced, beyond her years, but I did not catch her name.) We highly recommend the Conrad - but would not like to see it get too busy!",5,2021,07,19
209,Amazing,This hotel is amazing. If you want luxury & the VIP experience then this hotel is for you. The room service & overall service of the hotel was exquisite! Thank you to all. Will most certainly be back. The staff went above & beyond to cater for you.,5,2021,07,12
209,Business stay,"Update your bedroom, I did not get benefit from being a Hilton Honors Member ,
Breakfast poor , dining room poor , staff 10 out of 10 ,
The staff   5* experience . 
3*and 4* Hotel’s are of very high Quality in Ireland so we expect a lot from 5*.  ",3,2021,07,05
209,Weekend Overnight Stay!,"We checked into the Conrad Dublin on a sunny Saturday afternoon. On arrival we where greeted and bags where taken in (Slight opps from the concierge), he left the boot open on our car as my partner went to drive away. On arrival the reception team could not be more helpful. Overall the entire team was very helpful from the restaurant to the bar to breakfast. I feel the rooms need a little TLC few things very annoying for a Junior Suite marks on furniture and chips etc. Bathroom the shower was very low pressure and had to move it to enjoy it. Rainfall shower should be standard in a 5* suite. Overall i loved this hotel we normally stay in the Westin. This stay would make me return again to Conrad can't praise the staff enough. Special mention to Jake in the bar he was extremely helpful.",5,2021,06,30
209,Not great average,"Stayed here in June, 

the bed really not comfy, the staff are very nice, 

however nothing is really explained at the desk, 

Eg how to use lifts, there is a 50 e extra charge per night that you have to pay at desk that is kind of a holding charge if room is damaged (this is received back after stay but is massive cost up front which is annoying)

Parking situation is not really explained either? Kind of a hidden cost that is left unsaid 

The food at the hotel is also so so average it is not 5 star standard 

overall the hotel is just OK and the staff are friendly

To be honest the money we paid was way too much for what we got overall 

Just average",3,2021,06,27
209,A great hotel & great staff,Myself and my girlfriend got engaged here last night. A really nice hotel and the staff are great. Sasha was the girl I was dealing with and she is great at her job.. She organised everything for the occasion i.e room decoration for the occasion & champagne etc.  Will be back again for sure.,5,2021,06,13
209,Lovely staff. Beautiful place,"Myself and my partner had a bit of a mare with another hotel double booking our room so we called the conrad and Sacha at reception couldn't have been more helpful.  She went above and beyond.
We had a Beautiful stay.
Will definitely be back.",5,2021,06,10
209,LOVELY QUIET STAY.,"Brilliant stay in this hotel. Staff were absolutely fantastic, very helpful, chatty too. Would most definitely stay here again, no question about it. Food was delicious both for breakfast and dinner too.",5,2021,06,07
209,Great hotel and location,We stayed in a one bedroom suite in March 2020. Excellent location near St Stephens Green. Well appointed room and facilities. Excellent lobby bar and really good breakfast. Very good team who were really helpful in challenging circumstances.,5,2021,05,17
209,First Time to Ireland,"I could not have been happier with my stay at the Conrad. The manager, Shane, went above and beyond to welcome us and accommodate us throughout our stay, even setting up a tour of the city. The restaurant and bar staff were incredibly friendly and delivered excellent customer service. ",5,2021,04,09
209,Absolute greatness. For a KING & QUEEN!,"Luxury to a new level. Location in the middle of the city! Staff out of this world. I haven't a bad word to say except, the stay was not long enough! We will definitely be recommending this to our friends planning 2022 travels!",5,2021,03,19
209,5****** Luxury,"We indulged in city centre staycation and had a wonderful experience at this stunning property. The hotel is magnificent, world class service and true Irish Hospitality. Close proximity to the picturesque Iveagh gardens and St stephen’s green, perfect for families. Would highly recommend and can’t wait to return. ",5,2021,01,30
209,Christmas Lockdown ,"We are from 26th Dec, so prior to lockdown and stayed for 3 nights.
Hotel is fabulous, staff are most helpful. COVID policy in place and exceptionally clean.

The menu was the only letdown, little and repetitive, when your only choice is to eat at the hotel. After a few days / nights, it gets a bit too much.
Saying that, the quality of food served was exceptional.",4,2020,12,29
209,Exceptional!!,We stayed here in December 2020 and loved it!! Right from the beginning staff made a great effort in making our stay fantastic. The rooms were immaculate and décor all very modern. We had a meal in the Terrace and the food was absolutely Tops!!!! The breakfast and service was brilliant. I will be staying again and recommend to anyone looking to get a night away and stay in heart  Dublin city centre,5,2020,12,17
209,Pre Level 5 restrictions ,"We normally go to US for the last two weeks in October. With two weeks off and Level 5 looming we decided to go to town on Sunday and stay overnight and the Conrad was our choice.
It was a great choice even allowing for reduced facilities and lower staffing levels. From the minute we arrived till our departure we were treated to to ultimate service experience here.
Would highly recommend.",5,2020,10,22
209,Dublin City Slickers Stay cation,"Myself and my three friends decided to be tourists in our own city and stay in a well known Dublin hotel, The Conrad on Earlsfort terrace.  From the moment we checked in and until we checked out we were treated like Royalty.  The beautifully appointed bedrooms with interconnecting doors made the experience even better as we had so much space to move around.  The complimentary  bottle of prosseco was much appreciated also. We had booked dinner in the Terrace restaurant, a three course set menu, the food was very good, the service better again, we were able to sit outside because the terrace was heated very well and blankets etc provided.  Breakfast the next day was in the restaurant and served to the table, very enjoyable all round. I would strongly recommend a visit to this wonderful hotel",5,2020,10,19
209,Brilliant time!,"I had a brilliant stay at the Conrad! I couldn’t fault the experience. The staff were friendly, the food was delicious and the room was spotless. The hotel has gone out of their way to ensure COVID guidelines are meet, meaning I felt very safe during our stay. Thanks Conrad.",5,2020,10,18
209,A different experience,"So I looked to book a suite for a special occasion, however was convinced to take a smaller room (perhaps due to covid restrictions). Food was great in the terrace and service top quality in both reception and service considering circumstances.Room service of good quality also.
The issue was the room offered (128) was right over the entrance for the car park,  and when the door opened and closed (which it did 4 times between 11pm and 6 am ) the room shook and the noise was overpowering , waking me up with a big fright each time.
I would not recommend this room as a place to stay as a good nights sleep is the reason you want to stay away!",3,2020,10,18
209,Excellent stay,"Lovely stay with friend, Aishling was our waitress and she was so pleasant and friendly. Ciara was on the front desk and was lovely and very helpful. Thank you for a lovely stay. Room was beautiful.....",5,2020,10,17
209,Staycation,"For dinner we had The best mussels in town ! Parmesan and truffle fries and Hake fish .
All very delicious and very well cooked , the service was amazing as a 5 star hotel needs to have.
At the breakfast we had poached eggs on avocado toast and eggs Florentine , we enjoyed a very nice coconut latte made by barista and closed the morning with Belgian waffle and French toast topped with berries and  maple syrup  Many thanks to all the guys worked there on 12/10/2020 from the reception to the terrace downstairs.",5,2020,10,17
209,Excellent night in Dublin,I stayed in the Conrad for one night at the weekend and was absolutely delighted with the whole experience. The hotel room was spotless and felt very luxurious. Our stay felt every safe as all Covid 19 restrictions seemed to be abided by. Dinner in the Terrace was incredible and I've been dreaming about the breakfast there since. All of the staff were so friendly and helpful. I really recommend staying in the Conrad- it was great value for money and such a treat! I know now why its a 5 star hotel!,5,2020,10,15
209,Didn’t want to leave!,"This remarkable hotel is an absolute gem in the heart of Dublin City Centre. Stones throw away from St.Stephens Green which was perfect location. We were firstly so warmly welcomed by John and Deepu who were so friendly and courteous with some charming qualities added to our check in. They upgraded us to a Suite as it was our 2 year anniversary! The room was stunning. Immaculate with lots of extra measures in place for that virus that’s going around.... I could honestly not fault one single thing about the food there is a wide array for everyone dining. But if you’re vegan get the cauliflower floret, So delicious! Service in the Bar/Restaurant was prompt with no exceptions for the breakfast which I could eat over and over again. The mushrooms on sourdough toast! Mamma Mia! Melanie was so accommodating to our needs and is a breath of fresh air in the morning! 

Overall, it was a fantastic experience Highly recommended for any occasion. I would like to thank the staff for being so nice and helping us enjoy our night away !",5,2020,10,14
209,5 🌟  Dublin getaway,"I had a very special birthday stay in the Conrad. The staff and service was amazing and the room was gorgeous and spacious. We had a fabulous meal in the the terrace restaurant, the food was delicious. If your looking for a nice getaway during these strange times I couldn’t recommend the Conrad more.",5,2020,10,10
209,Great place to stay,"We booked short notice; where approached by the hotel directly advising us about a better offer; great contact, friendly staff! Room was well before checking time ready! Room was very clean and luxurious, compared to the great price we payed!

The hotel is located within 10min walking distance of St. S. Green; I van only recommend it!!!",5,2020,10,09
209,A fantastic stay and a perfect experience!,"We stayed in the Conrad for my girlfriends birthday. The Conrad went above and beyond to help us celebrate this. Form the moment we arrived we were greeted by the lovely receptionist Sasha. We then entered our spacious and clean room, a perfect base to explore Dublin City, which is conveniently at the hotels doorstep! The food in the terrace bar was great and the service was next level. The hygiene and cleanliness was expertly done to make us feel safe and comfortable. I couldn’t recommend the Hotel enough! Thanks!",5,2020,10,05
209,Treat yourself,"Living close to Dublin city it's a rarity to stay overnight however we chose to mark a a family celebration with a night ""in town"".
Adjoining rooms were perfect for the family and the staff could not have done enough to make us feel welcome.
Food was amazing - loads of little treat for the kids.
Thoroughly recommend a visit",5,2020,09,16
209,Mr Brendan O'Carroll,"Myself and my wife visiting Dublin having tried our usual choices in Dublin for something to eat on Sat evening with no look came accross the Terrace at the Conrad.
What a surprise , really nice food at affordable prices though surprisingly quiet for this hidden Gem.  Lovely staff particularly our waiter June.
Highly recommend a visit.",4,2020,09,12
209,Wonderful Family Break,"We stayed in interconnecting rooms over the weekend which was ideal for ourselves and our two kids 6 & 8 celebrating a recent communion. The location, accommodation and service from a team really intent on making your stay as positive as possible, they couldn't do enough for us from cookies and milk at bedtime for the lads to getting advise on what to do locally nothing was a problem. Breakfast was just superb and dinner on Friday evening was really really good in the Terrace Kitchen & Social Club. While not all the restaurants were open you didn't miss them as the food & service was so good in the Terrace, what a great place to spend an evening or Sunday lunch. Decor is also really nice.  We are planning another trip to the Conrad before Christmas as the location just couldn't be better and the kids want to stay in the hotel with clouds as beds they slept so well. Thank you to the Conrad team.",5,2020,09,01
209,Amazing gluten free afternoon tea!!!!,"Amazing afternoon tea here today.  All gluten free (pre ordered) and almost identical to my non-coeliac friend.  Best gluten free scone I ever tasted, (I'm no spring chicken!). Fantastic service and excellent covid safety measures.  So delicious I have already booked to go back!!!",5,2020,08,29
209,Fab one night stay!,"We're living in Dublin but due to missing out on holidays this year, we decided to treat ourselves to a night in town and so glad we chose The Conrad. 
We had a room with a balcony so we ordered drinks to our room and sat outside; it felt a little like being on holiday because the weather was lovely.
The room was great, bed was so comfy.
The staff were super friendly and welcoming and all precautions were taken around Covid. We were so well looked after. 
I would highly recommend a stay here - such a treat!",5,2020,08,13
209,Luxury,"Stayed here before covid and, now that things are opened up again, we recently stayed for two nights. Gorgeous rooms and tasteful decor enticed us back. The beds here are wonderful, as are the pillows. Staff are super. Dining is limited for the time being. Bit surprised that cereals and fruits etc are available on the room service menu but not available at breakfast in the restaurant. Think they need to look at that. The hotel is very very quiet at the moment so maybe the Conrad chain should also take a look at its pricing. Felt very safe re covid. Only slight problem on this trip was that the seagulls kept us awake on both nights! Never heard them when we came a few years ago but they were a menace on this occasion. Surprised we could hear them but the room only had a single-glazed window so that explains it.",4,2020,08,07
209,Amazing stay,"Went to Dublin for the cancelled International rugby . As a result the hotel was quieter than normal . Rooms , staff and food all top notch and a location that can’t be beaten . Only gripe as before was RTÉ basement bar , staff not half as professional as the hotel staff . I thinks this is farmed out . Best hotel in the city centre   ",5,2020,04,02
209,Beautiful Hotel in a great location,"What a beautiful hotel right next to St Stephen’s green! We are loyal Hilton people and this hotel did not disappoint!! The staff is lovely, caring and goes above to make everyone feel appreciated. We had a beautiful one bedroom suite. The breakfast was great with lots of options. We had casual dinner & drinks at Alfie Byrne’s! It was good & the staff was great. We will definitely come back when the world gets back to normal! ",5,2020,03,16
209,Staff was amazing,"Exceptional staff and hospitality. Location is great. Great offerings in the hotel, but price for food is high for the quality. Charging station in room is very nice, and does not require a converter. ",5,2020,03,09
209,Superb,Spent a couple of nights here and the staff manage to make you feel relaxed from the moment you arrive.  Very comfortable room with everything you need to hand.  Restaurant and bar were a treat and the staff couldn't be more helpful.  Just wish we could have stayed longer!,5,2020,03,09
209,Brilliant boutique style hotel with excellent service,"We’ve stayed at all the major hotels in Dublin and this was by far our favourite . Situated in a quieter corner of St Stephens Green which makes it easy to access and still close to everything . Beautifully laid out public areas , the bar and restaurant are just lovely spaces , understated modern luxury . The bedrooms and bathrooms are spacious and the rooms felt designed with lovely textures and very comfortable beds. The service was brilliant , such friendly and attentive staff, next trip to Dublin, I’m booking in!",5,2020,03,09

Concierge all the food and beverage staff doorman every one who made our stay so fabulous ",5,2020,03,03
209,Lovely stay ,"Recently stayed at the Conrad for a couple nights as my husband was there on business and my son & I joined him for a quick getaway. This hotel is clearly catering to business travelers but we found it very comfortable and so well situated for us to walk the city by foot. Rooms were spotless and the beds were clean, fluffy and white- extremely comfortable. Ciara checked us in as we came first thing in the morning from the airport and we had a room ready to cleanup & change after our overnight on the plane. She texted throughout the day to check on our needs and to let us know when the other room was available. All of the staff were helpful this way - making sure you had an umbrella on your way out, etc. The location can’t be beat- quick walk thru St.Stephens to Grafton, quick walk to anywhere you want to go. Walked one morning to Pearse and hopped on the DART to Howth for a lovely morning, returned by one and stopped at the National Gallery. Never needed a cab the whole 2 days we were there.
We have stayed at Airb&bs and at the Westin in Dublin before (all great) but I’d happily return to the Conrad!",5,2020,03,02
209,Great Hotel,"I wrote this to express a compliment for Conrad Dublin. I spent a wonderful stay in Conrad Dublin. Every staff is kind and helpful. because that day is valentine's day, they decorate my room in celebratory fashion and provided a sweet welcome amenity. On that special day, I got special treatment. I really appreciate everything provided by Conrad Dublin. Especially I wanna thank Ivana, she is charming, friendly, and really helpful. I admire her professional attitude and excellent service. She justifies the Centennial Brand of Hilton.",5,2020,02,27
209,Outstanding,"What an amazing experience! Upon entering the hotel lobby, every employee there made you feel like you were the most important person in the world. Rooms were spacious and clean! You won't regret your stay! I will definitely keep the Conrad brand in mind during my next vacation. ",5,2020,02,24
209,One of the best Hotels in Dublin,"Myself and my wife stayed at the Conrad last Saturday night, the staff are extremely welcoming and very hard working. They food was excellent and we will be back in the future. Loved the breakfast in the morning - we both took a complementary coffee and headed off.",5,2020,02,24
209,Excellent accommodation ,"I cannot stress highly enough the excellence of this hotel, the staff were warm and friendly and nothing appeared to be too much. They made the place feel like home and the quality of the room with its view of the National Concert Hall was of the highest standard. We were celebrating a birthday and, on our return, on the first night there was a card signed by staff and a happy birthday plate - a thoughtful touch and very much appreciated. The location was perfect for all the main attractions but away from the hustle and bustle of the crowds. Highly recommended and excellent value for money.",5,2020,02,23
209,Green Gem in Dublin,"After an overnight flight,we were hoping to simply check our bags until check-in time.  Well they allowed us to check in at 6:30 a.m.  We had a nice nap and felt refreshed to start exploring Dublin. Room was wonderful...clean, comfortable, and nicely appointed.",5,2020,02,22
209,Outstanding remarkable stay,Awesome stay. Booked via Amex platinum travel services. Upgraded to a suite. Very spacious room. Good Shanghai Tang amenity kit. Staff very helpful and friendly. Arranged for a surprise promotion celebration during the stay and all superbly done. Great Conrad stay. Highly recommended ,5,2020,02,21
209,Great Hotel perfectly located,"This was our second stay in Dublin and we decided to give a try to the Conrad. The hotel is perfectly located to access all the main areas of interest,  near some very good pubs and local museums. The hotel is very nice, comfortable rooms, very decent restaurants and with good amenities. But what makes it stands out is the quality of service. The staff is very king and pay attention to details, this turned our stay from a very good one to an outstanding one.",5,2020,02,20
209,Excellent Business Hotel,"This is an excellent business hotel. 

It is in an ideal location for access to business venues and dining establishments, whith a great variety to choose from.

209,5* ??,"I spent the weekend in Conrad Dublin.

Cons: ugly external look and views from most of the rooms. Small rooms, missing cups, glasses and coffee capsules in the room, standard breakfast, water in plastic bottles, gels/shampoo/lotion/conditioner made in China.

Pros: great and polite service, the hotel is spotless clean, great lobby design, great location, close to all tourist attractions/restaurants/pubs.",4,2020,02,17
209,Perfect 20th anniversary trip,"Absolutely perfect hotel! Clean, quiet and perfect location. 
I cannot thank the staff enough for the kindness they showed us. Very professional and friendly!
Great pub located on the property and walking distance to downtown. 
Excellent breakfast buffet and superb coffee. 
Will definitely be back!",5,2020,02,08
209,Fantastic,This is a Fantastic hotel with the most wonderful staff! Hotel is modern and bright. Food was great. Staff all very helpful and friendly. I do wish it had a pool or spa facility tho but still I think it’s the Best hotel in Dublin.,5,2020,02,07
209,Highly recommended ,"We stayed last weekend for 2 nights - Lovely hotel - a few minutes walk through st Stephen’s green to grafton street where you’ll find plenty of shopping and less of a walk to Dawson street or Baggot which have plenty good bars / restaurants . Definitely brilliant location wise. 
The staff are excellent- they were so friendly and helpful . 
The food in their Coburg brasserie was excellent - the stand out dish for me was the duck salad . 
The bar , lemuel’s , was great - Barman Adam made us some great cocktails . 
The basement of the building i believe is leased to Galway brewery company under the name ‘Alfie Byrne’s’ - we went there for one drink but didn’t like it and quickly returned to lemuel’s upstairs in the hotel - hands down the best hotel bar for me . We had been in the shelbourne the day before for drinks and found their no.27 bar way too busy and the service in their horseshoe bar borderline rude - to be fair shelbourne staff are usually good . 
The Conrad is now my favourite hotel in Dublin - way better than the shelbourne and the westbury in my opinion . ",5,2020,02,04
209,Very welcome.excellent service,"Stayed 1 night.from arriving to departure ..made genuinely welcome.
High standard of comfort in room.
I challenge a nicer breakfast set up .can tell alot of thought,aim to please and
Creativety gone into production well done",5,2020,02,04
209,Review of overnight stay 1st February 2020,"We were received in a most welcoming way. Our room was magnificent. Everything we could need was there including a massive TV 🥰 Uninterrupted Wi-fi was excellent. The staff in the lounge and restaurant were very helpful and courteous and clearly enjoyed looking after us.  My cousin is an insomniac, but had the best sleep of her life! At breakfast staff were bright and cheerful and catered to all our needs. I will most definitely use the Conrad when I go to another concert in November this year 🙏🏼 We were at a concert @ NCH 1/2/30",5,2020,02,02
209,Good stay apart from night Barman.,"8 of us stayed here 24-26 th January .Very clean rooms ( 411 ) Breakfast was buffet or choose from menu. A bit slow in restocking breakfast items e.g poached eggs ,mushrooms.  Polite staff though.  We would like to thank Michael Lowther ( i think that was his surname ) he was the night shift on Saturday-Sunday.We got back to hotel around 03:00 and enquired if we could have some fries only to be told in a grumpy fashion that NO only if we ordered room service. We then asked about some crisps to go with our cup of tea. Nothing.!!! Michael overheard this request and assisted us by getting us some nibbles. What great customer service. I do not know the name of the barman but he seemed to be more interested in serving the only 2 people that were at the bar.  Great customer service Michael. Keep up the good work.",5,2020,01,29
209,I only spent two nights but they were great...,"Everything about my very early morning arrival was smooth thanks to the two staff checking me in, they were attentive, professional and warm... They even chuckled when I attempted to be funny. 

They upgraded my room and needed thirty minutes to finish preparing it, I was starving so they kept my luggage and I went and had breakfast in The Coburg Restaurant located just off the gorgeous white marble lobby, and another warm Irish welcome. [read my Coburg review]

After breakfast I went back to reception and collected my key then up to my suite, I think the fourth floor, the room was lovely and nicely appointed... The bathroom I thought was a bit on the small side, but clean as a whistle. I showered the long flight off me and proceeded my fun packed agenda.

While I was out, I ran into a dear friend who was in Dublin and just finished a business conference [at a different hotel] and we made plans for dinner that night at my hotel, she wanted to get away from all the conference people at her hotel [we've all been there]

Dinner was fabulous [read my review]

The Conrad's location is great, many things to do around the hotel and not so far away from all the downtown Dublin attractions like Temple Bar etc...

I chose to not find the gym so not help there, and I had no time for spa treatments... again no help, sorry. But I can tell you my King size bed was pure lux! 

As this was the beginning of a nearly two week holiday, could not have gotten off to a better start, I have not one issue to speak of and highly recommend The Conrad [and the Coburg yum yum yummy]

Enjoy every adventure ahead of you and all the diversity our planet offers.",5,2020,01,24
209,Excellent again ,"My husband and I were in Dublin on business and stayed again at the Conrad. An exceptional stay, we greatly appreciated the upgrade to a Conrad Suite. Very nice room and as always a very helpful staff who was very kind. We ate all the meals at the hotel. Good food and service. As a Diamond member, received a full breakfast buffet. Everything was very fresh and we especially enjoyed the pastries. So nice that everything was bake that morning.

We highly recommend the Conrad as everything was excellent. A great business hotel.

Thank you",5,2020,01,23
209,Good spot,"This is a Conrad so you tend to expect it to be a cut above. On the soft side, it was. The property staff were generally excellent. The front desk was very friendly and helpful. The bell desk was the same. When we departed with an early flight they were very helpful in getting a taxi and preparing a breakfast to go. Truly above and beyond. 

The hard side however was a little lacking - not bad - just not better than the average Hilton. The room was a bit on the small side although the bathroom was good sized and two people could get ready at the same time.

The wifi was excellent. During winter you'll have to open a window to cool the room down. The property was very quiet with no road or hallway noise. I found the bed to be uncomfortable. Now that's a personal thing and I don't see a lot of people complaining so it could be an odd mattress ready to be replaced or perhaps Conrad beds are just different from Hilton beds and I'm more of a Hilton kind of guy. Again, not the end of the world but when you're expecting the Conrad to exceed the Hilton...

Breakfast was good - on par with the average Hilton in Europe. I've had a few that were better on the Continent but that wasn't bad. Again, the question in my mind is was it better than the Hilton - and I'd say not really. It wasn't worse - just not feeling much difference between the Conrad and the Hilton (hard side - definitely a difference on the soft (people) side).

I liked the location. It's a quick walk to Grafton St. Just far enough away to keep things quiet and a nice stroll to reach the fun areas. 

Bottom line - I'd stay here again. But I'd probably look to see which was the best value - Conrad, Morrison or Hilton. All three are good and close to equal on the hard side. If you want/need the really exceptional staff then the Conrad is the better pick.",4,2020,01,20
209,Exceptional hotel with outstanding food and service,"To Dublin for a long weekend, pre- Christmas. A warm welcome at check-in and an imaginatively- decorated, top floor room with good use of colour and lighting.  Shanghai Tang toiletries, real coffee in- room, useful work desk.  Buffet breakfast was one of the best we’d ever experienced. Only downside is the slightly functional building exterior and location/ unattractive external views, which has led many of the windows in the public areas to be screened with blinds The interior aesthetic though more than compensates. A five minute walk into the museum quarter and about ten minutes to the bustling commercial centre. 

Other guests were tourists and business travellers of broad age range and nationality.",5,2020,01,18
209,Beautiful hotel with very friendly staff,"Stayed here for two nights for a treat with my husband. Lovely friendly staff on reception with the most incredible smell of flowers when you enter the reception and rooms cleaned to a high standard. We were on the fourth floor and it was nice and quiet with a great view out the front of the hotel.
Car park underneath the hotel was really handy Although 20 euros a night.
A little disappointed that no cocktails served after 10.30pm on a Friday night but the Barman/night porter made up for it and we had a great rum and coke/ gin and tonic and the comp nuts were lovely.
Only a short 10/15 min walk to Grafton street via a lovely walk through st. Stephens green. So perfectly located to shops and restaurants.
We didn’t do breakfast as at 28 euros was too expensive but the dining room looked amazing.
Will definitely return here if in Dublin again.",5,2020,01,18
209,"Location, staff, elegance","I came for business but stayed an extra day to sight-see. The hotel was marvelous. The room was elegant and spacious. The housekeeping staff was outstanding- accommodating my requests, spotlessly clean room, and attention to little details. As an example I like my coffee milky. After asking once for extra mild for the fantastic Nespresso coffee, they continued to remember and bring me extra each day. I did not have to ask. The host at breakfast remembered me each day and greeted me with a smile. Breakfast was delicious and ample. Finally, I had a WONDERFUL experience in Lemeul's Bar where the bartender, Adam, took the time to craft me a wonderful cocktail and chat with me while I sat alone at the bar. He managed to juggle the entire bar, all drink orders, and still made time to make me feel welcome. That is important to a woman traveling alone. I can't wait to come back for a proper vacation as the location is perfect and within walking distance to all the major sites.",5,2020,01,11
209,Excellent service and quality,"Stayed here during a business trip because it was recommended by Hilton Honors. Excellent service, great breakfast, quality staff, and clean rooms. Centrally located to good gastropubs, restaurants, and city attractions. ",5,2020,01,11
209,Birthday surprise,"The Conrad Dublin is a beautiful property and everyone has been very kind. I checked in a day after my birthday and they made sure to wish me a happy birthday upon arrival. Later that night I returned to find a wine bottle to help me celebrate,  what a marvelous surprise!",5,2020,01,08
209,A smashing experience!,Loved the Conrad.  We are planning a return in Spring of 2021!  A remarkable hotel that accommodated a 7 month old--admittedly adorable--a five year old and a granddad with some limited mobility.  The staff was gracious and helpful.  ,5,2020,01,08
209,New Years.,"Myself, my wife and our daughter stayed for three nights 
From the moment we arrived with meeting Jim the concierge and reception team everyone were so accommodating.
The rooms and furnishings were beautiful and the linen was to die for.
We dined twice during our stay the first night was fabulous.
But on New Years Eve the dinner was so exquisite from starter to dessert , we had invited our son and his partner to join us.
It was one of the best New Year Eves dinner that we ever had in our entire life.
Thanks goes to Gary and his kitchen team.
The team at the Conrad were one of the finest that I have come across in all my years of travel, always willing to accommodate your request.
Thank you to Kevin the Manager for the hospitality given to us during our visit.
We will look forward to returning to the Conrad very soon.

 Good luck to everyone in 2020
",5,2020,01,06
209,New years wine and dine,"Stayed on new years eve and had dinner in the restaurant which was a fabulous  experience the service and hospitality  was exquisite.

209,Dublin trip Conrad hotel,"Stayed in the Conrad Dublin last night. Service was superb from the check in desk staff to the dining hall staff. Hotel was spotlessly clean, our room was beautifully laid out with lots of amenities amshome comforts.   Staff were both approachable and efficient. Food in the dining hall and breakfast were high quality a well presented. Will definitely be going back and recommend for anyone stopping off In Dublin",5,2020,01,05
209,Great room and attentive staff,"My husband and I stayed at the Conrad in October 2019.  From the moment we checked in, the service was impeccable.  The room was spacious and had extensive amenities.  There are number of great dining choices at the hotel as well.
I took advantage of the gym, which is relatively spacious.
My only criticism is that the breakfast is a bit of a zoo.  However, I feel that has more to do with the morning rush than any of the staff.",5,2020,01,04
209,"Clean rooms, amazing breakfast, lovely staff","Our stay at the Conrad Dublin was exquisite. We were taken to our room and shown how to operate all of the lights and thermostats which can be confusing. Our room was a suite with a gorgeous sitting room and a delightful soaking tub. The room was quiet and comfortable with lovely linens and everything was super clean. Because we were on our honeymoon, the breakfast staff greeted us with mimosas and took our photos - some of the best we had on our trip. We truly felt welcomed with open arms to this incredibly luxurious hotel.",5,2020,01,03
209,Home Away from Home - Christmas at the Conrad Dublin,"Simply the best ""away from home"" Christmas experience imaginable. Friendly, attentive service from the moment of arrival, comfortable and cozy rooms, and fantastic dining experiences with the exceptional menus for Christmas Eve and Christmas Dinner !",5,2020,01,02
209,Beautiful Rooms & Problems,"We stayed for two nights in late December 2019.  The rooms and lobby were spotless and beautiful. Housekeeping did a great job. Amenities were good.
Receptionist upon check in was not just not good.  It was well after check in time, and she struggled to find two rooms in the same area of hotel as we requested.  Once in our room, we got a knock on the door with a treat- our kids room did not.  We got turn down service, our kids room did not.  The concierge was unfamiliar and had not heard of 14 Henrietta Street, the Dublin tenement museum (rated #7 of things to do in Dublin) and he was unaware of holiday openings and closings of sites (Trinity Library, Castle Museum, etc.)

Could live with that, honestly- but not what happened next.  We asked for our car to be brought to the front hotel for 6:15 AM on Sunday morning.  The receptionist put in the order.  At 6 :00 AM next morning my husband called down to confirm- and was told there was no one to bring the car down.  They gave him a slip and sent him to the 2nd Floor Garage, and he was locked outside of the hotel- without a CAR key,  They disabled his key card and forgot to give him the car key.  After some texting, I went down and told the desk staff he was locked out, without keys.  They ran keys to him. 

However, as I was walking to the elevator, there was a NAKED man sitting in the chair by the elevators. I did not engage him, as I was unsure of everything- and was worried for my safety.  When I got to the lobby, I reported this to the staff, and they went running- upon return they told me sometimes guests get confused after drinking too much- and when they mean to go to the lavatory, they mistakenly exit their rooms instead. 

So, this is a 5 star hotel that looked like that- but the bumbling staff and naked guy left me with a very poor impression.

I completed the customer satisfaction form from Conrad, but have not heard back.",2,2020,01,01
209,Fabulous Family Hotel,"My family and I stayed in the Conrad before Christmas and from check-in to check-out it was amazing! Our girls were spoiled by all the staff and they couldn’t do enough for us too! The breakfast was, hands down, the best breakfast we have ever had in a hotel! 
The rooms were beautiful and the bedding was  divine! 
There was such a lovely feel for Christmas in the hotel.
I only wish we could have dined in The Coburg but we had plans with family, the menu looked fantastic.",5,2020,01,01
209,Fabulous stay,"We stayed for 2 weekend nights in March. Location is excellent, so convenient for shopping & socialising. The hotel itself was beautiful, fabulous spacious room, delicious breakfast and tasty cocktails. The reception staff were also great, particularly Sasha! Thank you for a fab stay!",5,2019,12,31
209,Brilliant place to stay in the middle of Dublin!!,"I stayed at the Conrad for Dec 20 & 21 and the staff made my stay much better than I expected. Friendly and attentive from the minute I arrived until I left. 
To top it all off, the hotel has wonderful menu options but if you wanted a change, there are plenty of restaurants within a 5-10 min walk. 

I will be recommending this to friends and family and will most definitely be staying here when I return to Dublin. Thank you Conrad Team!!!",5,2019,12,31
209,Fantastic family stay,"Stayed with the two youngest for a night over Christmas. We were upgraded to a suite which had its own Christmas tree and a box of toys for the kids to use during the stay, both of which were appreciated touches. The whole hotel had a great family friendly atmosphere which is rare for a city centre 5 star hotel. 

We all had dinner in the Coburg restaurant which was very nice followed by a drink in the bar afterwards. Breakfast next morning was lovely with a great selection of foods on offer. Staff throughout were very pleasant and helpful especially John at reception and Kevin the Operations Manager. 

We all really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,12,30
209,Anniversary ,"I just want to say that Conrad is a hotel that deserves the 5 star.
Form the check in to the room was all excellent.
Is very near Grafton street which is the fashion district shopping place, you have the music hall just crossing the street , Stephen green park 3 min walk , an amazing location close to everything near city center. ",5,2019,12,29
209,Excellent welcome in an excellent hotel ,"I recently stayed in the Conrad for 2 nights over the Christmas period and I can’t wait to return. Calling this hotel 5 stars doesn’t even scratch the service of the professional, pleasant and polite service we received throughout our stay. A special mention must go Sasha who checked us in and out, a real credit to the hotel with her pleasant attitude and knowledge of the local area. Keep up the good work Sasha and staff!",5,2019,12,29
209,Conrad Dublin,"The Conrad Dublin is a great place to spend Christmas 
We have come here for the last 5 Christmas’s and hope to do so for the next five. 
Hotel is modern, very clean, very friendly staff, great food, great location and a fabulous Christmas Day menu. 
Susan in the restaurant is so helpful and friendly at breakfast 
Shay Foley",5,2019,12,27
209,Great Trip ,"Great location off St Stephens green with short walk to Grafton St.
Fantastic staff very friendly and welcoming.
Great Christmas feel also
Comfortable rooms,clean and that bit of
Great for trip with friends in Dublin. ",5,2019,12,25
209,A Christmas visit to Dublin Ireland,. The ConradHotel was a perfect location for relaxation and shopping. The hotel dining room  was first class and bar service was excellent. The room was quiet and all the staff were very professional and made you feel welcome. First class all the way. A morning stroll in adjacent St. Stephens Green was peaceful and beautiful and a good beginning to a busy day.,5,2019,12,24
209,Good hotel with a great location,"The hotel stay started off with a rocky start but got better.  We arrived around 5:30 AM they checked us in without mentioning we had breakfast included in our room. We realized it on day 2 of 4.  The hotel staff was amazing and worked that out for us.  The hotel has an amazing location, I would recommend it for families! I would stay here again, the stay got much better as time passed. ",4,2019,12,18
209,Birthday,Stayed here last weekend with my daughter We got a lovely room which was ready when we arrived at 12 30   It had everything we needed for our stay.  We had dinner in the restaurant Mine was lovely but my daughter s lacked flavour.  We were disappointed with the lack of Christmas atmosphere in the hotel.,4,2019,12,16
209,Fantastic Hotel,"We've recently stayed here for a birthday celebration & the hotel & staff have been fantastic.
Location of hotel is walking distance to St Stephens Green & Grafton St, the hotel itself is fantastic.
Rooms were immaculate & comfortable, breakfast excellent with excellent staff.
There were a few extra touches by hotel for the birthday that went above & beyond most hotels. Thank You.",5,2019,12,16
209,Top end! ,"Excellent service and accommodations!  The hotel is in the heart of Dublin, walking distance to attractions, bus lines and shopping. Rooms are modern and comfortable and service is excellent. Food service is also good, but the bar is pricey!  With the many pubs close, its worthwhile to walk up the block for a pint! ",5,2019,12,15
209,Lovely return stay,"Stayed in the Conrad again for 1 night recently and enjoyed it as much as my previous visit. Our room was again very comfortable and this time, I found the bed, the duvet and pillows extremely comfy. Robes and slippers are provided in-room, as are all toiletries you could need in the bathroom. Breakfast is tasty with a great selection of items, but on this visit, I did find the staff a bit disorganised; we were offered the incorrect hot beverages 3 times, waited about 15 mins for the right one, and weren't offered any toast etc. These issues could have been down to the busyness of the breakfast room that morning. There is a carpark onsite which guests can use for €20 per 24 hours; and the location is brilliant - less than 1 minute walk to Stephen's Green. Would recommend this hotel if you're looking for high-standard accommodation in a central location in Dublin.",4,2019,12,13
209,Very Nice Place,"The Conrad is known to Dublin as the nicest place in town (at least to the cabbies) and it was very nice. If you're from the US and want to feel more ""at home"" then this is the place. The bathrooms were well appointed, the coffee maker was fabulous and the beds, pillows and linens were very nice as well. For me, it was all very American. Now, I'm not against America, in fact, I'm a proud American. During our stay in Ireland we stayed everywhere from Hostels to BnB's to this very, very nice hotel so I feel like we got a good taste of Ireland but If you're from the US and one to get homesick, this is a good place to stay. You'll be well taken care of well. It'll feel just like home.",4,2019,12,12
209,Amazing hotel. Attentive staff,"Just have come back from a lovely one night break with my wife to celebrate our wedding anniversary. This hotel is is top notch. Lovely and attentive staff, elegant rooms and great eating and drinking options. We grabbed a light lunch in the Alfie Byrne bar which was lovely. Later in the day after some shopping we grabbed a cocktail in the ground floor bar. 
The rooms are elegant and very tastefully decorated. We stayed in a premier room which was a great size and the bed was fantastically comfortable. 
Breakfast was a highlight- great selection and everything fresh- one of the best breakfasts I have had in a hotel if not the best
Highly recommended - I will be back with my family as a silver Hilton member",5,2019,12,08
209,Service Counts,"Had an excellent stay at the Conrad Dublin. It’s obvious from the time you check in to the time you leave that customer service is a priority.  Check-in was seamless and front desk people were very helpful.  In particular, Jim and Dave were great with recommendations on things to do and places to eat. They really went above and beyond and we appreciated it.  The hotel is downtown and within walking distance to a number of attractions and good restaurants.  We booked our stay through American Express Fine Hotels and our room was excellent and the breakfast buffet was filling and well presented. Again, staff at all the restaurants were excellent. 

We highly recommend this hotel and will stay here again when visiting Dublin. ",5,2019,12,07
209,Near the hustle and bustle of Central Dublin,"Stayed here for a recent business trip and booked on a whim as a loyal Hilton Honors member not knowing how close I was to Temple Bar area and Grafton Quarter. Actually crossed the street and was in Stephens Green!

Can’t also say too much about he property itself as from the staff to the restaurant to the room amenities are all grand. Decent fitness center for a Conrad property but other than that it’s somewhere I will certainly return for a Dublin visit.",5,2019,11,28
209,Beautiful place conveniently located in the heart of Dublin.,This is a lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin. It is walking distance from many places you want to enjoy while in Dublin. The lobby is currently decorated in the Christmas spirit and is very welcoming. The room was lovely and spacious. We liked the fact that we could use the mini fridge to chill our water bottles. The staff is very welcoming. We have really enjoyed our stay in the Conrad Dublin.,5,2019,11,25
209,Best in Dublin,"Arrived at Conrad Dublin at 6am after a long overnight flight.  When I approached the front desk to see if I could leave my bags until room was ready, I was informed that I could go straight to my room. Nice to know that they understand the fatigue international flights can cause and try to help with early check in when possible.  No guarantees, but nice gesture.  The beautifully appointed rooms are extra large with high ceilings and heavy draperies that keep out light and noise.  The buffet breakfast was large and delicious with all the hot and cold foods anyone would need to start the day with a smile.  The staff are helpful, warm and friendly.  Location is great for walking to all major Dublin attractions.  This was my first stay at this hotel and it will be my go to location in Dublin in the future.",5,2019,11,21
209,PERFECT PLACE TO CELEBRATE MY 50TH BIRTHDAY!,"If I could give the Conrad 10 stars I would!  This was my 4th stay at this hotel, and I have never been disappointed!  from all of the employees at reception, to the restaurant staff, and the doormen,  everyone is so pleasant, and professional! They always acknowledge that I am a returning guest, and leave special chocolates with a welcome back note in my room!  I love it!  What an elegant touch.

 I would like to specifically thank Manuel, at the front desk, for making me feel so special, and for going above and beyond my expectations this last weekend.   I felt like a princess, and I will never forget this Birthday, it will remain in my heart as one of the best, and most unforgettable birthdays ever! 

 I will be back in a month, and look forward to staying at the Conrad again!  

xx- Amy",5,2019,11,20
209,Amazing Experience!,"My stay at the Conrad was fantastic! The staff went above and beyond to make me feel very special. When I informed them that I had an early flight on Sunday morning, they made sure to have breakfast, coffee, and a taxi waiting for me at 5 am! The staff was lovely, the breakfast was amazing, and the room was beautiful. Great and central location. Overall, I highly recommend! ",5,2019,11,19
209,Amazing return visit,"We returned to stay at the fabulous Conrad for our wedding anniversary.  What can we say but thank you for another amazing stay.  The front of house staff, concierges and restaurant staff were impeccable and their attention to detail was second to none.  We received an upgraded room even though it had been a while since our last stay.  Cleanliness is superb and its extremely comfortable.  Situated close to St Stephens green and most places are within walking distance.  Would highly recommend this wonderful hotel, can’t wait to return.",5,2019,11,16
209,5 Star elegant treat in the centre of Dublin,"We had a fabulous get together and celebration lunch in the Conrad Hotel, Dublin yesterday. I cannot decide which was more impressive, the setting, the food or the service. From the moment we arrived everything was top class. Beautiful drinks, served perfectly. Stunning food and refined service from start start to finish. The food in The Coburg Brasserie was amazing. Our favorites were the Rack of lamb and the Duck Salad. The Steaks were to die for also. The service was unobtrusive and polished. Thank you to Levente and Dmitry  (Hope I remembered your names right).  I have always been a huge fan of the Conrad hotel, but haven't visited in a number of years. The hotel has had a massive face-lift and the interior is absolutely beautiful.  Warm, luxurious, and welcoming, we could have stayed all day. We will definitely be back. Highly recommended.",5,2019,11,16
209,Great stay,The service at the Dublin Belfast was outstanding. The rooms were all remodeled and Luxurious. The Location next to St Stephen's green was Awesome. We were able to walk to all City central attractions....Had a great stay.,5,2019,11,16
209,Second visit - great hotel,"Our second visit to the Conrad, and we had a great stay. 

Comfortable room, good amenities, practical location, great food and friendly bar. All at reasonable prices. 

Very handy for the 757 airport bus service, just 100m away",5,2019,11,15

ALL the people at the front desk were so accommodating. The restaurants were the best-& we loved their waitresses...,5,2019,11,14
209,Great location for centre city,"Excellent location for attending the National Concert Hall, slightly pretentious but the staff are willing to put you at ease. Rooms are comfortable and well equipped, we stayed in a superior king room, ( although the room was spacious but not a suite) 
Breakfast is generally not included in the price. Price of breakfast is in the region of 30 euros. But tea and coffee is supplied in the room, you have to request fresh milk, if required.

209,One of the most friendly hotels in the world,"The Conrad in Dublin, is a unique hotel located in the city center . What makes this hotel so special, is the staff.

209,Wonderful stay thanks to brilliant staff,"My wife and I recently stayed here for our daughter’s graduation and we will most certainly be booking in with this hotel for future trips to Dublin. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive. The hotel location was perfect for us as we had a dinner reservation near St. Stephen’s green. We spent some of the evening in the hotel bar, which was cosy and again the staff were superb. We finished our stay with breakfast the next morning, which was delicious.",5,2019,11,12
209,Wonderful Stay Close to Park,We spent a week in Dublin at the Conrad. The people were so helpful making sure we got to do everything. There was so much to do a simple walk away. Right down the street is a beautiful Park. You can walk too many great restaurants and bars as well as a large shopping area.  It's also a short walk to the train station that will take you to other areas for nice day trips.  There's a bar downstairs that's a lot of fun to visit as well.  The breakfast was amazing every morning. Highly recommend.,5,2019,11,11
209,"Modern clean rooms, spotless facilities, great staff","This is a good choice if expecting a clean, modern hotel with good service.  The rooms are pleasant, modern, and fresh, the facilities are good, the hotel in general has a good vibe, and all the staff - maybe with the exception of a lady who works in the casual restaurant during weekdays - are great.",5,2019,11,10
209,Luxury Hotel and Outstanding Breakfast Buffet!,"I don't usually start with comments on the breakfast buffet, but this Conrad warrants a huge plug!  This was the first time ever that I've had Eggs Benedict at the buffet, not ordering them from the waiter, just available at the buffet.  So many adorable details were at the breakfast buffet like the tiny mini cast iron pans that contain condiments, Baileys on the buffet, incredible sausages and also delicious salad options including fresh beets which I love!",5,2019,11,08
209,Excellent service and hospitality.,The staff went above and beyond to insure our stay was as comfortable and pleasant as possible.  I would only stay here from now on and any future visits shall be here.  It is a very high standard to hold other places against. Thanks!,5,2019,11,08
209,Awesome Birthday Weekend,"I was lucky enough to spend my birthday celebration at Conrad in Dublin. It was the perfect way to Celebrate. The hotel was stunning and the team could not do enough for us. Starting from the minute we arrived we were look after in an Excellent, friendly, and caring way. I would like to highlight the efforts of Mark Basalyga as he went above and beyond to make our stay and my birthday memorable. We will definitely be retuning the next time were in town.",5,2019,11,07
209,Great base for exploring Dublin,A fabulous Hotel located next to St. Stephens Green. Great access to all Dublin's attractions. A short stroll across the Green gets you to Grafton Street. The staff are very welcoming. The reception area smells utterly gorgeous ! Our room was very spacious with very comfortable beds. Everything you could need is in the room and kept well maintained daily.,5,2019,11,05
209,Fantastic stay,"Just came back from 3 nights at Conrad Dublin and we really enjoyed ourselves. On arrival we were given an upgraded room on the 6th floor and it was beautiful. Comfortable, spotless and nice extras including slippers, robe, lovely toiletries etc. Breakfast was delicious and couldn’t be faulted and we were made to feel welcome by every member of staff we spoke to. This will be on my list of return hotels. Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2019,11,04
209,Impressed,"My opinions may be slightly skewed as a I received a random fantastic deal on our room, otherwise it would've been out of my price range. With that said, the stay and service of the hotel was amazing and I would stay again knowing what a great property it is. ",5,2019,11,03
209,Great Service,"Every time I run a Marathon I like to eat mashed potatoes three hours before the race, So I asked Shane if I could have some delivered to my room. And at 4:30am there was a knock on my door and excellent mashed potatoes arrived on a silver tray. That's what I call great service!",5,2019,10,31
209,5-Star Hotel and Service,"Just a quick review to rave about the Conrad Hotel in Dublin. My wife and I were there for only one night but were amazed at the service and hustle of the staff as well as how nice this hotel was. I was very appreciative to Sasha and especially Shane who literally ran us down a taxi during the craziness of the Dublin Marathon. Well done Conrad staff! 

As a Diamond Hilton member this hotel is spectacular. Highly recommend.

209,Great Hotel,"Good location and very helpful staff.

The rooms were good size and it was an easy place to use as a home base to walk the city. The staff was very helpful and did everything possible to make our stay satisfactory.",5,2019,10,26
209,Extremely Pleasant Staff - Luxurious Facility,Entire staff we dealt with during our stay was extremely pleasant. This shows that company or the management behind the facility is extremely dedicated and passionate about hospitality. Staff went out of their way to meet our special needs. This was more important as we were traveling with baby. Staff gives you space and at the same time will make sure you are comfortable. We also had personal chat with some of the staff. They went out of the way to keep us comfortable and most of the time anticipated our needs. Accommodation is pretty luxurious as well but if for nothing else you can stay here for the extremely pleasant people who run this establishment.,5,2019,10,25
209,"Amazing service, best hotel in Dublin","I have been travelling to Dublin for work over the past 5 years and been staying at the Conrad Dublin. All the staff are great, amazing custom service levels...feels like a home away from home for me. Recently I have been travelling with my wife and son, and everyone at the hotel have gone above and beyond to ensure our stay is very memorable. Ivana, the guests relation manager, always ensures that we get the room we need for a young family, including an unforgettable experience in the Presidential Suite. Thank you so much!!!",5,2019,10,25
209,Even better than last time,"We love staying at Conrads, and this one is a personal favorite now that the renovation is complete. It has one of the best diamond breakfasts at any Hilton we've stayed at, and the airport bus drops you directly next to the hotel. We will continue to stay here whenever we are in Dublin.",5,2019,10,22
209,Plan ball 2019,"I was at the Plan Ball last saturday and I was amazed by the beautiful hotel. It was my first time inside the Conrad and it won't be my last! 
Our company had a great night,the staff were so friendly and helpful. I want to say a special thank you to our waitress Sarah, I told her I was coeliac and she went above and beyond to ensure I had a gluten free dinner. She was efficient and had a great personality and filled us with wine all night! Great event and amazing hotel.

Thank you to all the staff",5,2019,10,21
209,Great Stay!,"We stayed here for a night to celebrate my husbands birthday. The hotel is well appointed and has great parking on site. It is straight across the road from the concert hall and I would urge you to attend a show while you are in the area. As we were staying for a birthday, I contacted the hotel to see if they could do something for him and they were so good, they really went above and beyond. The room was decorated nicely and there were lots of little extras such as a separate kettle and coffee machine, sewing kit etc. The breakfast was absolutely delicious and I would have no hesitation in returning for another stay.",5,2019,10,20
209,Not so “Conrad” ,"We stayed for 5 nights, overall okay but we expect much more in Conrad. 

Staffs are friendly but working style is too casual. When we returned to the hotel one night, the room is cleaned but not the rubbish bin which is full of trash, it was late and we’re checking out in the morning so didn’t bother to ask housekeeping to clean it, it would be okay for me if it’s a motel/hostel/2 stars hotel. But hey it’s Conrad! That leaves a very bad impression. 

On the day we check out, there’s long line waiting and we saw a counter with a tag “Hilton Honors” with no one lining up, we wonder if we can do the checkout there as we both Gold members. We asked a staff, he said “yes you can but there’s no one (staff) there, you can go line up in the queue (pointing to the long queue)”. Well, thanks for the helpful advice! 

Finally it’s our turn to check out, the staff presented me a bill with a mysterious €538 item, I double checked and she spent 15 minutes to figure out “oh that’s a system error”, thanks again!

Definitely don’t feel like in Conrad (pretty much like in a motel in service wise) and definitely don’t feel like to stay again, probably not any Conrad!

209,Great Dublin hotel,"Stayed here twice in the past 2 months. What a pleasant experience. Service was impecable and everyone so friendly. Rooms are nice and the breakfast buffet is splendid. 

Oh yeah, look up Ciara at the front desk. She is so nice and helpful 😁thanks for everything Ciara! I hope your management reads this and passes on what a great hotel ambassador you are for them.  ",5,2019,10,13
209,Oasis in the city.,"Hospitable staff, comfortable rooms, luxurious bath products, delicious and generous breakfast spread with French press coffee, nice hotel restaurant, bar, and casual pub. Something for everyone! Could improve wine selection, but this is an issue all over Ireland where wine drinking isn’t as common. ",5,2019,10,13
209,Love this hotel!,"The biggest ingredient in any Hotel is the team.  Here they are just brilliant!  My second visit last weekend, still great!  So friendly,professional, knowledgeable and very, very smart!
Interior, understated loveliness.  Breakfast that I have to keep getting up for, that's unusual for me.  The range of yummy things OMG!  
The beds at the Conrad are wonderful, home from home for me.
Have the schnitzel, you will not be dissapointed.",4,2019,10,10
209,Weekend in Dublin,Excellent hotel in great location.  Easy walking access to city center.  Fun pub in basement of hotel with craft beer and irish pub food.  Fine dining restaurant on main floor with adjacent restaurant and bar adjoining.,5,2019,10,04
209,Modern Comfortable Dublin Hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights.  After mostly B&Bs for four weeks, the new comfortable predictable hotel was a pleasure.  Great location, yet out of the bustle. The reception staff were excellent, and handled a room snafu very professionally and to our liking. Dining room and breakfast service were weak, but the pub downstairs was good and welcomed.  We would stay here again.",4,2019,10,03
209,Curate's egg. Mixture of sublime and chaotic,"Have stayed at Conrad for last week. First with my GF at weekend and then on my own for conference during the week.

First and foremost it is a lovely modern well located hotel.

The rooms are comfortable and at least upstairs on 6th floor the bedroom windows open.

Most aspects of service are strong but there are weaknesses.

Getting in for breakfast service in morning takes longer than any other hotel I have stayed in. The mind boggles how it can take quite so long day after day.

And then booking a car to airport from reception seems to throw front desk staff into meltdown. When I tried to book hotel car for airport the morning nobody knew what the hotel car's schedule was. Having missed my flight home from same hotel a year earlier (it was raining and seemingly no car available) I was not reassured by suggestion I should come and see if there was a car around the following day. It is incomprehensible booking hotel car for airport should be quite so chaotic in a modern city centre five star hotel.

As with restaurant at breakfast I fear reception staff are off the pace for this level of establishment.",4,2019,10,02
209,"Great Hotel, Great Location","The Conrad Dublin is conveniently located near St. Stephen's Green, which is a beautiful park to walk through each morning.  The hotel is a very comfortable, clean hotel and the staff is excellent.  You are within 10 minutes walking distance to the heart of Dublin and there are buses or taxi's readily available for anywhere you want to go.  We had a great experience at the Conrad Dublin and would recommend to anyone visiting.",5,2019,10,02
209,Favourite Hotel in Dublin,"I've stayed here twice in the past 6 months. Rooms are lovely (whoever the interior designer is did well) and very comfortable.  My last stay was in Room 106, which had lovely high ceilings and seating area outside. Breakfast is good though I will note that on both visits they were slow replenishing dishes on the buffet. Overall service is great and you can't beat the location.",5,2019,10,01
209,"Excellent hotel, central location, excellent customer service","We have stayed here each December for the last 5 years as a treat just before Christmas. We have stayed in many other hotels, but each time we keep comparing back to the Conrad. What really impressed us in our most recent visit was the fuss the receptionist made over our son. Breakfast is not included, but worth every penny. We ate in the restaurant in 2017 and waitress was very attentive. Can't wait to return again this December",5,2019,10,01
209,EXCELLENT IN EVERY WAY,"Our return visit to the the Conrad was up to its normal standard of excellent, the ease of parking and check in was seamless,  our room was spotless and the decor is very tastefully done. Our breakfast had a good choice and although they were busy we were looked after.  Later in the coffee dock again a nice buzzy feeling and the service really good with plenty of attentive staff. Our walk into Grafton street is such a pleasure and having such a good nights sleep, the Conrad must definitely be one of the quietest hotels in Dublin we were set up for the day.  The little gem is worthy of its 5 stars -  I am already looking forward to my return visit - WELL DONE TO THE TEAM AT THE CONRAD AS YOU MAKE IT LOOK VERY EASY",5,2019,10,01
209,Perfect,"We had such a lovely stay on Saturday 28th September- The welcome we got from Rachel was second to none and also John and Shane at the front desk were so helpful and friendly.
Rachel was great company for our nightcaps in the bar and looked after us so well!
Everyone in the breakfast room were so helpful.. nothing was too much trouble. 
I also loved the decor of the hotel and our room was perfect.
So all in all a 10/10 stay and will look forward to coming back to that lovely atmosphere.  ",5,2019,09,30
209,Overpriced for what it’s worth.,Paid way too much for this hotel. Great location and view but the room itself was not the best. Air conditioner barely cooled the room. Also rug in first room was soaking wet. We also for house keeping to service our room and it was not done,3,2019,09,28
209,"Excellent hotel - great location, great facilties","This is our first trip to Ireland and this hotel in Dublin was excellent. Great location- easy to walk to the park (St Stephen Greens), shops, and restaurants. The staff was very friendly - want to say thanks to Manual who helped us get a weekend Doctor when my husband got ill. Overall great experience and will return!",5,2019,09,28
209,Great stay!,"We had a king Suite which was very spacious.  It included the buffet breakfest which was very good.  We ordered room service a couple of nights which was good, but not great.  The service was excellent however.  The staff was very helpful when ever asked.  Specifically Manuel was a great help when trying to resolve a medical issue and we were very appreciative.  Location was also very good.  Would definitely return to this hotel.",5,2019,09,27
209,Conrad Dublin Charm,Great hotel and I have traveled all over the world - it's the staff that makes this hotel so grand.  Especially the front desk staff headed by John with the incredible service of Ciara and Shane.  Would return again and again.,5,2019,09,26
209,Awesome Service,"Due to a foot injury we came to this hotel at the last minute and stayed for 2 nights. From  the minute we got there and throughout our stay the hotel staff was exceptional. They gave us a wheelchair to use so I was able to get around both in and out of the hotel as well as visit the restaurants. The food at each of their restaurants was fantastic and the room service came up fast, hot and delicious. Definitely a First Class Hotel!",5,2019,09,26
209,Amazing Service in the Heart of Dublin,"Stayed here at the start of the month with my wife & couldn’t have enjoyed it more. From the check-in to breakfast the next morning all was excellent and staff were most obliging. I have to leave a special comment to the gentleman working in Housekeeping who is one of the managers. He was very helpful in assisting with a personal issue we had while in the room.
We met the General Manager ( I think) in the lobby from Wexford, I think his name was Kevin?? He advised us of a great days activities in Dublin and a great watering hole for a drink or two. Others that impressed us were Kim & Melanie and Olga at breakfast.
We will be back! ",5,2019,09,26
209,Tax breakfast at the Conrad Hilton,Gorgeous exquisite luxury and Saudi princes lounging around this was an awesome morning ☀ food served was fresh and the pastries served straight from the oven by highly professional and good mannered staff. Coffee served and surprising enough was better than. Starbucks,5,2019,09,26
209,First Class Hotel,"From Basement pub showing sports, to the much more formal dining room and bar, the service was first rate and the location was just a pleasant walk through the park to the shopping and entertainment areas.",4,2019,09,24
209,"Good place, close to Dublin center","Good hotel, bedrooms with plenty of space, very courteous service, ten minutes walk from the main attractions in Dublin. Good breakfast English / continental style available. Funny: I could not find a way to toast my bread, but perhaps I should have asked somebody from the staff. Breakfast officially opens at 6.30 (I am an early bird), but on weekends expect some delay.",4,2019,09,23
209,Perfect Dublin Hotel,"We stayed two nights at the start of our two week Ireland journey.  Everything about this hotel was wonderful.  The rooms and breakfast were amazing.  I will never forget what the desk staff did for us.  Our luggage was lost by the airline during an overnight flight.  The desk Manager gave us early check in, then sent up 2 bags of items that helped us get through until we could do our own shopping.  Not just a toothbrush and extra bottle of shampoo.  It was amazing what they provided us, and they would not add the cost to our bill.   I won’t ever forget our wonderful stay at this outstanding hotel.",5,2019,09,18
209,Fabulous Location with charming rooms,Check In was amazing. Shane was charming and a real asset to the hotel.We arrived early in the morning and were lucky enough to get a room straight away. Stayed on the 7th floor. We were given an upgrade as we are diamond members. The rooms are very small and I am not a fan of showers over baths. But the bed is comfortable and the furnishings are made from beautiful Irish fabrics. The breakfast room is very small. The food offered is not as good as other Conrad’s but the chef prepared a tasty omelette. The staff in the breakfast room were not as efficient as they could be . Top marks on the location of this hotel. You can walk across the street through the park and you are in Gratton Street.,5,2019,09,15
209,Why stay anywhere else,"Steps from Stephen’s Green, close to everything, comfortable and inviting.  The breakfast was great. The rooms were big and relaxing. Loved the inlaid carpet and the wooden floors.  I could have spent all day in the room and see none of Dublin and I would have been happy.",5,2019,09,10
209,Wonderful Hotel and location,"We had a fabulous stay at the Conrad Dublin.  The rooms were a nice size and the bed was so comfortable. The hotel staff was amazing, very helpful and friendly.  Location was perfect! I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay again when back in Dublin.",5,2019,09,09
209,Nice hotel with lovely atmosphere ,"Very friendly staff and a good location near the green. Sandwiches could be a bit larger!!  

But a very nice bar and restaurant overall. 

Rooms very clean and nice views if you’re high up. 

Good Wi-Fi which is what you need if there on business. 

",5,2019,09,09
209,"Friendly staff at the reception, bad room service","As a member of Hilton Honors my wife and I have seen some good Hilton Hotels all over the world. The Conrad Dublin belongs to the hotel chain Hilton. So we expected the same standard as everywhere, but it was not so. As we entered our room we saw a big slit in the sofa. The coffee for the coffee machine was not refilled. At the following days we only got coffee after a request at the reception. The milk was not refilled too. The ice machine, which exists on every floor, was not working in our floor. So that is no real problem - every floor has an ice machine. After visiting of 5 floors i found a working ice machine. 
It was not everything so bad. The staff at the reception was very friendly and gave a lot of tips, what we should do in Dublin. Especially the employee from Austria is very positive to mention.",3,2019,09,08
209,Long weekend in Dublin,"Stayed here for 2 nights,for a last minute long weekend check in was simple and quick the hotel is in a great location,which is a 5 minute walk too st Stephens green park,bed was very comfortable,room which was a good size there was all the amenities you would need,there is a safe in the room which is for your use which is complimentary there is tea & coffee faculties,bath robes & slippers,a fridge,shoe shinning facilities and a number of other available services etc and not forgetting room service .

There is also a free WiFi .for all quests.

We stayed on the 6th floor which was nice and quite.

The bar area was a nice environment for a few early evening drinks or later if you preferred all the staff were very pleasant,polite & attentive and they were there to help if you required anything a very well run hotel  and very professional staff.

We did not use the restaurant so i a cannot comment on the food as we wanted to see and do as much as we could in the short time we had while in Dublin.

Would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,09,08
209,Super!,"Excellent hotel. Super comfy beds and a fabulous breakfast. Close enough for an easy walk to all the top sites of Dublin, but away from the loud and busy nightlife. Staff were very friendly and service was top notch.",5,2019,09,06
209,Perfection everyday,"Perfection would best describe this Conrad! My room, my service, my breakfast, my room service, my check-in experience, my dining was truly one of pure delight. My server helped me make all the right choice! I spend about 100 nights a year in a Hilton hotel somewhere on the globe, so I feel I am an excellent judge of excellence! The staff and management in this Conrad, really demonstrate EXCELLENCE 24-hours a day! Thank you. ",5,2019,09,04
209,Fantastic location and dedicated staff ,"Traveling a lot for business, it’s nice to find a dedicated staff and a centrally located facility with ample food and drink options on site. 

Ciara - at the front desk - was very empathetic, attentive, knowledgeable, responsive and considerate. After traveling thru 3 countries in the preceding 4 days she was quick to get my room keys, helpful in directing me to cool and refreshing water and was able to guide my tourism needs after I freshened up. All of this was done with a upbeat and wonderfully understanding attitude. 

Conrad Dublin folks and Hilton folks - please recognize that this is the type of employee that deserves to be promoted and is a model of what hospitality representatives attitudes should strive to be. 

This Conrad is merely steps from Saint Stephen’s Green, as well as many restaurants and pubs. The hotel has multiple restaurants and bars on site, for meetings or grabbing a pint to relax if you choose to stay in the building. The brewery on the main floor offers many liquid refreshments. 

The views from the hotel rooms are meh, but the location is perfect for business, visiting museums, parks, restaurants and true Irish pubs. 

The service is where the Conrad Dublin really pulls away from the competition. 

Even when situations COMPLETELY out of the control of the staff occur - like a power outage of multiple blocks of Dublin at 4:30pm Thursday afternoon... the staff handled it seamlessly - checking folks in and out of rooms, getting drinks to thirsty patrons, comforting confused travelers... all of it at a level above and beyond reasonable expectations and with the professionalism you would expect of a much more posh/expensive location. 

I will certainly be back to the Conrad, Dublin! ",5,2019,09,04
209,Best Dublin hotel,"I always stay at the Conrad in London and i was equally thrilled with this Conrad in Dublin! Everyone was great and so attentive! Francisco particularly was amazing! He was so attentive, sweet, and helpful! We will sure be back! Thank you Francisco and the entire Dublin team! We will be back",5,2019,09,02
209,Great location,The location was really nice. You are a few blocks from St. Stephens green. The restaurant and breakfast were fantastic! I would highly recommend paying for breakfast here. I was a little underwhelmed with the room. The bed was comfortable and the shower was nice. Not too many other amenities. I say this because we paid $$$ a lot for the room and expected a little bit more. Staff was very friendly.,3,2019,09,02
209,WHAT A GREAT HOTEL,"I have stayed at the Conrad before and love the staff they are always friendly and willing to help. The bell staff Tony,Jim,John and James continue to amaze and make my stay exceptional.The food and bar are amazing. Anyone liking mussels must not miss the restaurant as they are some of the best you can have in Europe.The location is right off St Stephen's Green and moments away from Grafton Street and Temple Bar.Give it a try it won't disappoint.",5,2019,09,01
209,Conrad Dublin,"The staff were very attentive all the time. The hotel was clean and spacious. The breakfast was delightful and tasty.
Location was central to the sites we wanted to see.
If I were to go back to Dublin I would stay at the Conrad.",5,2019,09,01
209,Perfect Experience!,"By far, this was one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had-- and I've stayed at a lot of hotels!  From the moment I arrived, I felt very appreciated and welcomed by the front desk staff.  After telling Ciara this was my first time in Dublin, she got a map and spent close to fifteen minutes showing me where all of the good restaurants, shopping, and sightseeing spots were near the hotel.  I was so impressed by her friendliness and how helpful she was!  When I mentioned to her that my luggage didn't make my connection, she informed how the system generally works and that she would be glad to assist me if possible.  Btw, when my luggage finally did show up two days later, Ciara had them bring it to my room and she left a sweet note under my door since she was going on holiday and wouldn't see me again before I left.  That was so thoughtful!

I spent six nights here, and it was a perfect choice for my trip.  My room was clean, attractive, and I loved the little touches like the chocolates at turndown.  My room was also very quiet and I slept quite well, which says a lot since I generally have trouble sleeping in hotels.  The hotel is a perfect location for sightseeing in Dublin.  You're within walking distance to just about everything, and there is transit nearby for those places that require a vehicle.  

When returning to Dublin next year, I will definitely stay at the Conrad again!  This is a beautiful property and the staff are wonderful.  Thanks again to Ciara for being so kind, but I also want to give a shout-out to the other front desk staff-- you were all very welcoming and lovely.  This was an amazing trip for me, and you helped make it even better!",5,2019,09,01
209,My Dublin Happy Place,"This hotel is the best spot in Dublin for just about everything, Location makes it great for sight seeing as well as shopping and dining, and its a short ride from the airport. The property is an old and established landmark and a favorite of serious travelers who want the best.",5,2019,08,30
209,Conrad Dublin Exceptional Hotel,"This Hotel is Exceptional, from the Management, to All Staff Levels. Whatever our Family’s needs or services the Conrad Team made it happen. Turn down Service was beyond Wonderful, my Grandson was totally spoiled with Chocolates and Treats left around the room and for his parents. Our Rooms, The Restaurants and the general Hotel areas were Always Clean. The Food was Fabulous!! The staff were always friendly and kind making our stay one we’ll never forget.  We’ve already recommended the Conrad to Friends and Family.",5,2019,08,29
209,First rate experience,"I chose this location as a ""home base"" for my first trip to Ireland. It was a wonderful experience, and my teenager agrees. The service provided by the staff was phenomenal. As just one example, we arrived from the airport and I didn't have Euros to pay the cab. The helpful young woman at the front desk provided cash quickly with no fuss, and this was before my check-in was completed. The room was clean and nicely appointed andd the staff at breakfast was efficient and courteous. I am a fan for life!",5,2019,08,29
209,A Million Thanks,"Amazing stay, wonderful staff Kathie ‘The Trainee’ is an amazing team member, and the staff suggestions are spot on, a must return to hotel and experience. Dublin is an beautiful city with so much history and culture, a great all around visit. ",5,2019,08,28
209,Perfect anniversary stay,"We stayed at the Conrad Dublin for our anniversary this year (as we have done for the past few years) and were blown away as always with the quality of the hotel and the exceptional customer service.
This hotel is stunning, we were upgraded to a one bed suite which was immaculate and very spacious and presented with some macrons and other treats to celebrate our occasion.
The bar is lovely with great cocktails and service, we spent a couple of hours in here after dinner. Breakfast in the restaurant was amazing with a wide variety of excellent options to suit all tastes.
But even with the outstanding facilities and location, it’s the staff that make this hotel stand out; John Hegarty was fantastic in ensuring the team knew it was a big occasion for us, giving us a fantastic suite and we were very warmly welcomed by Ivana who made us feel so welcome and couldn’t do enough for us to make sure we had a memorable stay.
Already looking forward to coming back next year.
",5,2019,08,27
209,Excellent ,"We arrived late in Dublin and had already communicated with the hotel.
The check in was flawless and efficient and the room was already set up to accommodate us (family of 4).
We are diamond HH and were upgraded to a suite.
The suite was fantastic and overall the hotel has modern amenities.
Breakfast was very good and generous with an Irish flair.
The hotel location is unbeatable within walking short distance from main attractions.",4,2019,08,27
209,Exceptional In every department,"This is my 3rd visit to this amazing  hotel (which speaks for itself). It is exceptional in every way, from the quality of the room, the comfortable bed and the beautiful bed linen, the quality of the breakfast is outstanding. 
The caliber of the staff set this hotel apart. Every single member of staff we encountered were professional, friendly, helpful, cheerful and a credit to the hotel.",5,2019,08,25
209,Excellent accomodation,"Very, very good and classy hotel, very clever staff. Rooms are large and clean, with all stuff expected. Very good breakfast also with a la carte menu. Will repeat this very nice experience. Highly recommended",5,2019,08,25
209,Great hotel but overpriced,"Great Hotel ,easy efficient check-in, friendly staff, rooms are somewhat american standard versus european...large, great bathroom, Nesspresso coffe machine.Overall very nice Hotel but grossly overpriced at 329 eur...breakfast not included!",4,2019,08,20
209,Great Hotel,We stayed here a couple of weeks ago on business. Fantastic rooms and a great location. The staff were really helpful especially Claire on reception who couldn't do enough to help;p us. We will definitely be back.,5,2019,08,20
209,Our Trip to Ireland and our days at the Conrad Hilton Hotel,"I wish I could give this hotel 100 stars. When you go to Dublin you are missing out if you don't stay at the amazing Conrad Hilton Hotel. I am going to TRY to express how wonderful they are but I'm sure it won't do it justice.
First and foremost the staff is BEYOND anything that you could ever ask for. Friendly attentive and so professional yet warm.
It was our 25th wedding anniversary and a HUGE trip for us. We planned everything so carefully. The Conrad staff went way above our expectations. Upon check in, we were greeted with a warm welcome. Check in was so smooth and quick before we knew it we were in our room. The room (king room) was just beautiful. When we arrived there was a beautiful table set up with wine and chocolates and a special treat with wonderful dessert and a sweet happy 25th wedding anniversary message written on it.
There was also a beautiful note from the management welcoming us and wishing us a happy anniversary. EVERY SINGLE PERSON that we encountered from the staff wished us a happy anniversary. We felt like royalty. We were amazed at how they all KNEW who we were and that we were celebrating.
Chris is the bar..WOW SHOUT OUT!!! His hand crafted cocktails never disappointed. I learned very quickly to just tell him to surprise me and I was never disappointed. This young man has such a talent and a great future ahead of him. Look for his cocktail recipe book to be published in the coming years. I'm pushing him for that. :) He made us a special drink with popcorn syrup..OH MY..I had well lets just say..a lot of them.  :)
The food in the restaurant is fabulous! great flavors, wonderful presentations and of course the best staff!
We stayed for 3 nights and had a very strict itinerary for driving across Ireland. Well, things don't always go as planned. Due to some employee illnesses our spa day at Kinsale on day 8 of our trip was cancelled the day before we were to arrive. The original plan was to stay in Kinsale that night and get up early in the morning and drive the 3 hours back to Dublin to catch a flight to Scotland. Since that was cancelled we decided to just drive back to Dublin and stay another night at the Conrad. (truth be told, I missed them)
We called Hilton Reservations and they were able to get us a King room for 1 night. You can imagine our surprise when we arrived and were told that we had been upgraded to a suite for the night! The suite was gorgeous!
The hotel is located in the perfect place to walk to so many wonderful sights. I had a walking map planned for us that I did on Google before we left. I recommend doing this if you want to explore.
We walked to the Lovers Sculpture, St. Stephens Green, Iveagh Gardens, St. Patrick's Cathedral with ease. Valet parking is available along with self park if you prefer. 

THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE MANAGEMENT AND STAFF AT THE CONRAD HILTON!!!  YOU MADE OUR VACATION SO VERY SPECIAL!

209,Wonderful Stay,"A trip to Dublin with my family has become synonymous with a stay at the Conrad. 
The great location, the wonderful facilities, the beautiful rooms, the amazing food, the friendly service are the reason we return every year. 
",5,2019,08,19
209,Dublin stay,"Great stay staff were most helpful upon check in, room was great bed need to bye one that good staff  at breakfast let the experience down. Slow service when they remembered me. Eggs over cooked not the service I expected.",4,2019,08,18
209,Wonderful hotel in Dublin!,"My husband, daughter and I spent one night at the Conrad when we arrived in Dublin.  I only wish we’d had more time there as we had a lovely experience.  Excellent food (a late lunch and breakfast), the best of service and extremely comfortable lodging.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,08,18
209,A night before the wedding,"I booked this hotel for my wife to stay with her maid of honor and get ready on our wedding day that morning. Not only was the room well furnished and clean, the staff was attentive and kind, beyond any other experience I've seen. I was not there for the night, but the check in process was made smooth and unique by our front desk host Shane. It said he was a trainee on his nametag, but I wouldn't have believed it if you told me after our interaction. He was knowledgable, kind, and made sure to check up on us regularly. He also offered a complimentary breakfast for the room for my bride which was so sweet. After the stay, we received a prompt email that we had left my wifes passport in the safe in the room. Thank goodness for the attention to this by the staff. All in all, will definitely return and will definitely recommend. Thanks Conrad Dublin!",5,2019,08,16
209,Another great stay at the Conrad!,"Like usual, the service, food and accommodations were just superb. They helped with terrific dinner recommendations and arranging transportation around Dublin and to the airport. The service and food for breakfast was spot on. ",5,2019,08,15
209,Third Time's The Charm,"I've stayed at the Conrad Dublin three different times in the last few years and there is nowhere else I'd rather stay. I always stay 7 nights and it simply feels like I'm at home away from home. Everything from the staff to the restaurants is absolutely fantastic and the consistency is what brings us back. We absolutely love the staff and they're always so sweet and welcoming. They literally go out of their way to make your stay a great one. Yes, the hotel brand is a pricey one but when you get the service and accommodations like you do here, it is entirely worth it. I always urge people to stay here from the states and some have actually took my advice and loved it just as much as we do. Already looking ahead into planning another trip back next year!",5,2019,08,14
209,Fantastic stay,"We stayed a night at the end of our Ireland trip and everything was as outstanding as we expected from this Hilton brand. Our room had a lovely view of the city, the bed was comfortable and the shower and amenities were superb. We ate dinner and breakfast at The Coburg and lunch was at Alfie Byrne's on the lower floor. Service was always quietly professional. We were a little worried in the morning about getting a taxi to the airport but the front desk and concierge took care of everything. We plan to return to Dublin in the near future to visit the places we didn’t have time to see, and this is where we will stay. Outstanding in every way.",5,2019,08,12
209,Good value for money,"Stayed in a delux twin room which was spacious and clean. 
The staff was friendly and the location convenient for walking pretty much everywhere in the center.
Bus stop from and to the airport in the same street.
Great breakfast.",4,2019,08,11
209,Excellent Hotel,Great location and hotel. Stayed two nights and couldn’t fault the hotel in any way.  Staff are the best and breakfast is really good and you can have buffet or freshly cooked. A walk over the road and through the park takes you into Grafton street the shopping and dining street of Dublin. Rooms are exceptionally comfy and roomy.,5,2019,08,10
209,Only the Conrad for us,"This was my fourth time to visit Dublin. This hotel is my favorite. I’m a diamond HH and Katie worked hard to upgrade me to a suite! The bed was very comfortable and the rooms were immaculate. All the staff were friendly and quick to respond to anything I needed, including the breakfast staff. Shane at the front desk was great. I liked the hotel being in a quiet area and very close to shopping and St Stephens Green.",5,2019,08,08
209,Great Family Vacation Stay in Ireland,We a great stay in Dublin.  The staff did an amazing job assisting all 16 of us to make it a special trip.  Great location puts everything in walking distance.  The beds are really comfortable.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2019,08,07
209,Awesome stay in Dublin,As always the staff was amazing and the service impeccable. The only thing keeping me from giving a 5 rating is the quality of the air conditioning in the rooms. It was a fairly warm two weeks while I was in Dublin and the room air conditioners were not capable of keeping up with the cooling need.,4,2019,08,04
209,25th anniversary,Spent a lovely night in this beautiful hotel to celebrate our anniversary. On arrival we received an upgrade to a suite and a bottle of wine and some sweets complimentary- very much appreciated. The location of the hotel is perfect for the Nation Concert Hall.,5,2019,08,04
209,Great hotel with wonderful staff,"We stayed in the Conrad in late July and we had a great stay.  The rooms are clean, quiet and a good size.  The check in process was easy and Sasha was very helpful with our visit.  She spent just a few minutes with us to help us plan our stay and those few minutes saved us hours of time with what to do/see/eat etc. 

We had a food and beverage credit plus breakfast was included in our rate.  We went to the main restaurant, pub, and bar.  We received excellent service in all three restaurants and the prices are reasonable for a city hotel.",5,2019,08,03
209,Modern and Upscale Hotel in Dublin,The Conrad is a really nice hotel.  Our room was smaller in size than some of the others that we had stayed in but was very nice and updated.  The hotel is in a great location and a reasonable walk to many attractions and restaurants.  The staff at the hotel was very accommodating and helpful.  We had a very nice stay at the Conrad.,5,2019,08,02
209,Not the newest hotel- but possibly one of the best,"I've been travelling to Dublin regularly for 16 years and to be honest, stayed in most city centre hotels, from mid range to luxury. The Conrad sits above mid range and almost hits the luxury bar in my opinion. It has a spacious and very welcoming reception, with smiling courteous staff to greet you. On arrival at 1.00pm our room was ready and off we went. The room was spacious, well maintained, light and very well presented. We were only there for one night for a concert at the NCH across the road, so extremely convenient. 
After the concert we headed for the bar, which is cosy, friendly and almost too comfortable. 
I would really recommend this hotel for its staff, amenities, atmosphere, spacious rooms and fair rates for what you receive. 
I will return very soon.",5,2019,08,02
209,Fantastic stay,"We stayed last week to celebrate our first anniversary. We are always very busy at work, we work in Hotels too and spending two nights at the Conrad Dublin was just the best thing we could have done. Room 730 was incredible, amenities were fantastic, for two days in a row we received some sweet treats and we had a complimentary bottle of wine which sadly we didn’t drink as we were out all day. The Team was incredible, huge praise to Susie from breakfast, simply outstanding, welcoming and very friendly. Myself and my girlfriend were so happy to see her in the morning, she came over to tell us she was going for a break and probably not going to see us as she knew we were about to leave to catch a plane, she was very sweet, we will always remember her when thinking back to Conrad Dublin. Breakfast was incredible and really recommended having dinner in the Brasserie. Simply outstanding! Thank you again for everything!",5,2019,07,29
209,"Needs a bit more attention to detail, but nice staff and location!","I just returned home to NYC after a business trip that ended with two nights at the Conrad Hilton Dublin. While I really like the public space and the friendliness of the staff, especially front desk clerks, the room needs a little bit of attention. For example, in a couple of areas, the paint was rubbed away on the floor molding and the fabric on the sofa in the room was stating to split. I had seen the same sofa in the hallway standing on its side because it was being taken from another room for splitting in exactly the same places as mine. I do think they are trying to to be a top notch property, but for the price, I expected a bit more attention to detail. I did not eat in the hotel or use any other facilities, so can't comment further.",4,2019,07,28
209,Conrad experience,Warm welcom. Good facilities and amenities. Nice food and restaurant.The hotel surprised my friend with TLC pastry in the room before our arrival for my friend's birthday. It was such a short notice but the staff was very considerate and care.,5,2019,07,27
209,Wonderful ,"We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of the trip. The hotel is gorgeous and recently renovated. Very high end with excellent service. The complimentary breakfast buffet was great. Only downside is this hotel is not exactly in prime location, you have to walk a bit or take a cab to get to many of the attractions and bars/ restaurants ect. But for the money this hotel is definitely great!",5,2019,07,27
209,Wonderful!,"Outstanding staff! Clean room and tastefully decorated. Above and beyond customer service. I would highly recommend this hotel. I am very picky and often described by my husband and family ,as a pain in the butt lol This hotel was on point from beginning to end.",5,2019,07,24
209,Upscale high end hotel good location,"Beautiful hotel, with nice rooms and bathrooms in a close enough location to main areas. Centrally located for tours from St Stephens green. The restaurants were nice, and the suite was quite nice and well appointed.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.
Room suggestions- away from the street and the housekeeping area. We heard all the noises from the street including the music hall, and had housekeeping staging room by our room with a lot of noise quite early.

",4,2019,07,24
209,"An Elegant Oasis to begin your Dublin, Ireland experience","On a recent weekend stay in Dublin, I chose the Dublin Conrad based upon the recommendations of great service, convenient location, and excellent amenities. I was not disappointed. The staff was friendly, informative, and accommodating- going beyond their expected roles. The breakfast buffet was superb, with a feast of assorted breads, local cheeses and meats, and pastries, including a local honey bar. The service was excellent. The rooms were well- appointed, were of adequate size, allowing for a comfortable American king-size bed with soft linens and comforter. The location is near the well-kept and beautiful St. Stephen's Green, a horticultural gem that provides a wonderful early morning excursion. The hotel is centrally located to the major museums of Dublin and and the National Concert Hall. I was quite pleased with my choice and echo the many other guests indicating that the hotel is stately but not pretentious, a great central point to start your Dublin experience, and a good value for a luxury hotel. I strongly recommend the hotel and look forward to my return.",5,2019,07,24
209,Conrad Dublin,"The  hotel was very nice with an excellent very helpful staff. The lobby bar and restaurant presented itself nicely. The location was perfectly situated next to St. Stephen Green and Grafton for an easy walk to pubs, food, shopping and street performers.  Overall great experience. My only complaint was the hardness of the mattresses. It was difficult to get a quality night's sleep. ",4,2019,07,23
209,Great stay in the city,"We spent three nights at the Conrad Dublin last week and it was a very lovely stay. My husband was traveling for work and I accompanied him for fun. The hotel is just off of St Stephen's Green which was a great park to walk through to get to shops/food. The room was clean and modern looking. We had a great room, even though only two floors up, looked directly out front of the hotel. All of the staff were quite friendly and helpful. We did request early check in, which we did not receive, which is fine. But we actually didn't end up being able to check in until after 4, which was a bummer as we were hoping to clean up before we started our first tour. They brought our car up very quickly, every time we asked. But you do have to ask at the main desk, we didn't see a typical valet desk. We only ate at one restaurant on site, the Galway Bay Brewery which provided a good authentic lunch. They do stop serving food at 9, so good to know in case you wanted to come back for the bread and butter pudding after sight seeing, only to realize you can't have it :(

Overall, great stay. Would definitely stay here if we find ourselves in Dublin again. ",4,2019,07,23
209,Excellent facilities and location,"We stayed at this hotel for our first visit to Dublin. The quality of the hotel as a whole; the comfortable, spacious, modern and very tastefully decorated bedroom; the high specification bathroom and the friendly staff all contributed to a very good stay.
The location was great for being able to walk to all the main sights we had planned to cover in our 4 day stay, and being close to Merrion Square, and very close to St. Stephen's Green meant that it was possible to detune in beautiful green surroundings on the way back to the hotel.
We had breakfast at the hotel each day and the buffet had a very wide choice of good quality food, and there were also a la carte choices.
We had one evening meal which was excellent, though rather expensive  compared to some other local restaurants.
The public areas of the hotel are spacious and comfortable.
The staff were unfailingly friendly and helpful but there were occasional inconsistencies  in the standard of service. In all fairness, when these were raised with management, they responded with a very committed attitude towards putting things right and delivering a high standard of guest satisfaction.
I would stay at this hotel when visiting Dublin again, and would recommend it to others.",5,2019,07,22
209,From a Customer Service Director,Excellent stay and cannot say enough about the staff. From everywhere I went all were great and happy to be working there. The only issue I found was that the TV channels were in and out due to signal.,5,2019,07,19
209,"Great hotel, location, staff, and food!","Great place to conclude our trip to Ireland and visit to Dublin.  Room was well appointed and quiet, and food is exceptional! Easy walk to most of the big Dublin attractions. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay!",5,2019,07,19
209,"Excellent hotel, great location, great service","Excellent hotel, great location, great service.  First rate in all respects.  Property does not scream out Ireland if you are looking for something more traditional in terms of Irish decor and design.  Standard rooms are not large.  One of the best business hotels in Dublin, very convenient, very polished.  Recommended.",5,2019,07,18
209,Lovely spot!,"If you're looking for a brand new, clean, and high end stay in a great location in Dublin, look no further. Walking distance to several sights (St. Stephen's Green is right around the corner!), and wonderful accommodations and service. Thank you, Conrad!",5,2019,07,17
209,Big finish in Dublin!,"Our last stay on our two week trip to Ireland. The hotel is an easy walk to Trinity College and Temple Bar, and a number of other points of interest. The lobby is interesting and inviting; the bar off the lobby has fun and comfortable seating. Our room's decor was sleek, unobtrusive and calming. We had a great sleep on the mattress - most relaxing!  The staff was friendly and helpful. Highly recommended!",5,2019,07,16
209,Absolutely outstanding hotel,"We loved this hotel not just because of the beautiful rooms but the staff went above and beyond duty to make our stay superb. An extra big shout out to Ceri at concierge, Alberto, Francisco and Alex (dining).
We will stay here whenever we are in Dublin again without doubt.",5,2019,07,15
209,Delivering on their five star promise,"Give anyone enough money and a decent architect and they'll create a beautiful hotel environment.  But the real test lies in their ability to select, train and motivate a team to deliver truly five star service - every day, with every customer interaction.

Take a bow, the general manager at The Conrad in Dublin - your team are exceptional and are what makes this hotel special.  Thank you for a wonderful stay and go give your team a well-deserved pat on the back.",5,2019,07,14
209,"Comfortable Hotel, very nice location","Spent a couple nights here, pre-cruise, to explore the city.  Access to the hotel from the airport was very easy with the do dublin bus.  (definitely recommend, stop at St. Stephens Green).  Our room was available for early check-in (thanks).  The room was clean and comfortable and quiet.  Breakfast was more than satisfactory and very enjoyable.

Access to the city was a simple walk through St. Stephen's Green, a quaint park that is an attraction by itself.

Definitely recommend.",4,2019,07,12
209,Fabulous hotel,"Excellent stay for 4 days. Staff were very helpful and the break fast selection was good. Clean rooms and good service 
Will recommend this hotel for future needs. This was my first visit to Dublin good location ",5,2019,07,11
209,Great Staff!,"Excellent service!  I was pleasantly surprised as to the upgrade in the quality of the service and food in the restaurants.  Room service was simply ""over the top"" with elegant presentation.  The complimentary breakfast was outstanding. The one negative and it seems to always be a problem with this hotel is that one has to ask specifically for a room that does not have an unfortunate view, Spotlessly clean!",5,2019,07,10
209,Wonderful experience!!,"Helpful staff (mostly), with clear expectations to made us feel welcome. Breakfast is ok. But the dinner was amazing, price is very reasonable and food was in high quality! As a family of 4, we ALL love it. Location is wonderful as well.",5,2019,07,07
209,Wonderful experience ,"Stayed here for 3 nights with my wife on a visit home whilst my parents kindly looked after our kids!

Not absolutely central but an easy walk via Stephens Green to Grafton St. Very high staff to guest ratio and all staff were strikingly courteous and welcoming. My first real pint of Guinness in a year was as good as I hoped as photographed below. 

Lovely dinner in the Coburg. Breakfast buffet beyond amazing. Gym was perfectly adequate. Alfie Byrnes in the basement for coffee was a real find - you open these non descript doors and suddenly a vibrant bar opens up before you. 

Room very comfortable. Only minor gripes would be lighting in bathroom and the unusually high bed. 

My most enjoyable ever short break in Dublin. ",5,2019,07,05
209,We Had a Great Stay at Conrad Dublin!,"My overall stay at the Conrad Dublin was great. They had a great breakfast selection, including a gluten free station, and everything was delicious. The rooms were a reasonable size, and they allowed my granddaughter to have a connecting room with us. To say the least, the Conrad Dublin was a great hotel to stay at.",4,2019,07,04
209,One of my favorite hotels,"The Conrad Dublin has so much to offer. The location is perfect - a block away from St. Stephen's Green. The rooms are spacious and well-appointed, with nice extras. The breakfast is really fantastic. It is a buffet with lots of options, including black and white pudding. The staff was very helpful. I would definitely stay here on my next trip to Dublin.",5,2019,07,03
209,Beautiful hotel,"Beautiful hotel. Staff are 1st class, lovely helpful, friendly. Room was spotless great size. Everything you could need in the room, its no problem for the staff to get you a taxi from the hotel. Staff cannot do enough for you. One of the nicest places i have stayed",4,2019,07,02
209,Fantastic Food!,"Came here for a business Trip, the oysters were to die for!! The bread and butter reeky Brought out the flavours and the mushroom risotto with truffle oil is something I will defiantly go back for! The staff were extremely friendly and polite! I wish I had more work trips to Dublin. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Cant fault.",5,2019,07,02
209,"Good, but definitely not up to Conrad standards","This hotel should be rated as a Hilton and not as a Conrad.  Conrad is one of the top- of-the-line hotels in the Hilton family - this hotel is very practical and nice with a good location, but it certainly cannot be said that this is luxurious.  It is a fine hotel but the prices are for luxurious hotels, and this is not one of them!",3,2019,06,28
209,Amazing hotel and great experience!!!,"I was in Conrad Dublin during one of my business trips and all I have to say - great experience!
The location was very good, near the center of the city and also not far from the Guinness factory (for every recommendation for all that are coming to Dublin). 
I have only the words of praise for employers they were at the disposal all time with great help for any kind of questions. 
The rooms are also very good for good night sleep and rest after a hard day. 
The only thing that could be a little better maybe is the service for breakfast. Well for the hotel at that kind of level you do not have a very big choice for food. 
For the conclusion, if I come again in Dublin, my choice for sure at that level of price and service will be this hotel. 

All the best from Petar",5,2019,06,28
209,Excellent - luxurious but comfortable,"What's there not to like about Conrad Dublin? First, what a great location. My wife was attending a conference in University College Dublin but we didn't want to locate ourselves south away from the city centre. Conrad was the best location possible since it was still city centre - just 100 meters from St. Stephens Green - but very close to the bus stops on Leeson and Stephens Green East and North Sts. 

I heard it had a costly makeover in 2016 so I'm seeing the results. Great inviting lobby with different alcove areas. It's keycard access to the lifts and to the room. Newspapers in the landing of each floor. 

The breakfast place is nicely laid out with several tables near the windows. The food spread is great - four types of kippers, different egg dishes, usual hot foods, lots of different veggies, cheeses, and you can order from four special dishes - plus a special of the day that kept changing. Or they can get you toast slices. We stayed for 10 nights and we never thought we had to eat the same food given the variety. 

Staff were great - from front desk to maintenance to waitresses to housekeeping. Especially Melanie at the breakfast place and Shane at front desk. 

The rooms is ok - not large but pretty decent, with lots of outlets, bed lights, and well-equipped toilet-bath. Toiletries look classy. nice pillows. easy to set ac.  The TV is wall mounted and large with enough channels. wi-fi is fast - but it was slightly irritating that you had to keep entering the passcode. The ref took some figuring out - turned out the switch to turn it on was on the wall beside it. Great coffee maker in the room.

A very good hotel overall for traveler types used to business class accommodations.",5,2019,06,27
209,Perfection!,"I spent 9 nights at the Conrad Dublin, and had a wonderful time.  The front desk staff is amazing!! as a HH Diamond member, our room was upgraded to the 7th floor,  executive suite, I think he called it....  with a fantastic view of gardens below.  We had a free breakfast every morning, which was excellent, and the restaurant on site was always accommodating. The location is, in my opinion, the best in Dublin, right by St Stephens Green.  I was sad to check out, wished I could have stayed longer! I will be back soon!  I would definitely recommend staying here!",5,2019,06,26
209,Great location ,"We just spent six nights staying at the Conrad Dublin. The location is excellent, in a quiet street near St Stephen’s Green.
Our room was rather small and there was limited storage space. The level of service, for example at breakfast and with housekeeping, was somewhat inconsistent. The food in the restaurant was good, both for breakfast and dinner. Rather expensive for what you get, though that might just be Dublin.",4,2019,06,25
209,Great hotel off the beaten path,The Conrad is a quiet hotel just outside of the downtown area near Stephen's Green.  A quick walk through the green will get you to town.  They have a wonderful breakfast buffet and will cook to order as well.  There is a restaurant and bar inside the hotel and a craft bar just outside it.  It was very clean and the staff was cordial.  They offer luxury pick up from the airport and will call a taxi if you need it.  It does have a lot of rooms and  a lot of guest come through so you may get lost in the crowd but overall a good stay.,4,2019,06,25
209,Super Hotel ,"Beautiful hotel, centrally located, staff extremely helpful especially Manuel who very kindly recommended Restaurants and made a booking for us on a busy Saturday night! Bed and pillows utterly divine really didn’t want to leave this super Hotel!!",5,2019,06,23
209,Sincere but dysfunctional and clueless,"I checked into the hotel on the evening of Monday around 09:00PM. I had had a tough flight and was suffering from Flu. I was told I have been given their premium room with king size bed etc. About mid night I realized the air conditioning had stopped working. I tried sleeping anyway but eventually weird scraping noises started coming from the air conditioning system. I finally called the reception who said the only thing they could do was to open up another room for the night for me to sleep in. Well so here I was at 01:00AM shuffling around Hotel floors in a bath robe with my phone and charger in my hand just so I could sleep. 

Next morning I requested them to please fix the problem. I came back that evening, checked with  the front desk that the problem had been solved and was assured that it was. Long story short, it wasn't. In fact it became much worse. The noises became significantly worse and started coming from the walls in addition to the roof. And so there we go again at about 02:00AM in the morning, dressed in a bath robe, a few key fobs my phone and charger in my hands running around hotel floors. To their credit they were very apologetic and assured me of an update the next morning (I was going to check out anyway) and I was told that the manager would personally look into it.

Come the next Morning and while I was checking out I asked the lady at the counter if there was an update on the problems I faced. She had no idea. Then she looked it all up and said ""Oh yes there seems to be a note here so we will look into it."". At this point I asked to speak with the manager. The manager came in and offered me a few thousand Hilton Honors points.

At £ 343 a damn night is it too much to expect a room where the air conditioning works and you can sleep? Or if it doesn't work then it be fixed? Or if it wasn't fixed then you be moved to a different room altogether? Or if none of that happens the manager has the courtesy to follow up with you personally and proactively?

In the interest of keeping things honest here, they offered me complimentary breakfast for the two days that I was there. I took them up on their offer. If you are reading this, don't bother. The food was okayish and the staff in the restaurant is perhaps the most apathetic and discourteous people I have come across. I committed a few cardinal sins of having both tea and coffee and requesting that my omelette be well done please. They don't like such things. Go in, keep your head down, have what you are given, politely get out of their way.

Oh also, if you want a cab hail it yourself from outside the hotel. The concierge is clueless. Sincere but dysfunctional and clueless. This phrase summaries the entire place - Sincere but dysfunctional and clueless (except the restaurant, they are just not bothered).",1,2019,06,23
209,Worst Conrad Ever,"I'm currently a Hilton Diamond member.

I recently have been staying at the Conrad Dublin from 16th-21st June. This is my first time booking this Conrad property.
Usually, whenever I travel to Dublin, I stayed at the Hilton Dublin and I was very please to the standard of services there. 

Hence, I was looking forward to the next level of services of Conrad standard for this stay.
Once I arrived, there were a couple of great impression:

- Cleaning services. All the maids are nice and friendly, they came to clean the room on time and left no mistake.
- The restaurant service and food were good.
- The room is bright and clean

However, I had a ton of problems during my stay:
- For the entire 5 nights of staying here, we (2 people) have 2 keycards and had to get them validate again and again for at least 2-3 times a day. In this incidents, instead of telling me the truth or letting me know about the problem, we were blamed for either putting the keycards next to credit cards, or phones from anyone who provide us the new card. Until the guest relation came to let me know on the my check out as there is currently a problem with the elevator card reader. We had to waste our time to get it validate every single times we cannot get pass to the elevator.
- There were a couple of wrong delivery of others package to my room (bag of books to others, check out envelope for other room, etc.)
- There was no waters provided, or the executive lounge until requested on the first day after we arrived to the room. Got voucher for 2 soft drinks upon request only. And have to request everyday.
- On my checkout, the rate of check out receipt that delivered were more than 100Euro per night than my booking rate. Luckily, I had checked and get the rate sorted. Otherwise, I would have to pay more than 600 Euro than what it should have been. They told me that the room has been upgraded. So the rate error changed.!!! I DIDN'T get any upgrade when check in. Reception told me that the room was fully booked.

Very disappointment to us for this trip. I felt like I almost have been cheated with the rate and also staying with the Garden Inn standard instead of Conrad.

Hope this feedback helps you improve on your services.",1,2019,06,21
209,Our Romantic Weekend in Dublin,"I have been here in October 2018, for a romantic weekend as my Birthday present.
The location of the hotel is very strategic, is located 200 mt far (maybe less ) from Grafton Street and St. Stephen Park, in the city center. 
The rooms are huge, equipped wit everything you need .
I have eat in the pub and in the restaurant of the hotel, simply perfect. 
Even the breakfast was delicious, the scramble eggs were AMAZING. 
Hopefully i will come back very soon. 
Thank you again

209,Loved My Stay Here,"My husband and I stayed in a Deluxe Twin Room on the 4th floor June 7-10. We didn't have any problems during our stay. The beds were quite large and comfortable. We ate at the restaurant the first night we arrived because we arrived late and did not want to go out. We thought the food was excellent. The hotel is a little off the beaten path, but if you cut diagonally through St. Stephen's Green, you come out at Grafton Street and the whole city is yours from there!",5,2019,06,13
209,Excellent hotel and location at Dublin,"The Conrad has an excellent location in Dublin, Ireland. Service is stellar. All staff were very helpful, knowledgeable and service oriented. The facilities are very well-kept and our stay was very pleasant. ",5,2019,06,13
209,Wonderfully Central Hotel,"We stayed for a night at the Conrad as we were attending the Metallica concert outside Dublin and fancied a bit of Luxury, following the undoubted grunge of an open air concert.
The Hotel, staff, amenities and location were all faultless and I can safely say that the bed was among the most comfortable that I've experienced.

Looking forward to going back !!",5,2019,06,10

209,All pros,"Can’t think of any cons when reviewing this hotel.Front desk staff is friendly, welcoming and efficient.We ate at the pub, used the bar and had breakfast in the main restaurant and everywhere service was excellent.Rooms are exceptional( we had a suite) and cleaning crew very considerate and efficient.We are older folks and the fact that this hotel is central but on a quite street was a perk.The Park  is next door and great for strolls, jogging,contemplate nature.Grafton street is a 10 min walk in a very safe neighborhood.We even walked to the Jameson distillery and the Guinness museum.St Patrick cathedral about 15-20min walk.",5,2019,06,09
209,3 stars,"Just finished 3 days of business meetings held in the conference rooms of the Conrad. The hotel was 

+ Service. Check-in/out was efficient.  Both room service delivery and restaurant service was prompt and professional. No issues with facilities / wifi. 

+ Location. The hotel was walking distance from our office, Grafton Street, St Stephens Green, etc.  

- Food. The selection of food available at the hotel was pretty sparse. The breakfast buffet, lunches, dinner and room service were all fine, but there was very little choice, and not a lot of healthy / veggie options.

- Room. The room was of modest size, neutrally-styled, and adequate for business travel. The reason I call the room a negative is because I found an insect on my bed as I was packing up this morning which concerns me a bit. 

- The gym was quite small. 

The Conrad was pretty “middle-of-the-pack” in terms of my Dublin hotel experiences. ",3,2019,06,07
209,Brilliant hideaway right in the city centre,"The Conrad has almost become my second home as I visit Dublin regularly for work - the staff across the hotel are fantastically courteous and efficient and genuinely want you to have a great stay.  I have stayed many times and always have the same high quality experience.

The rooms are very comfy and quiet as the hotel is a stones throw off the busyness of the city centre the other side of St Stephen’s green, the restaurant is great and the bar in the basement is also great - in fact, everything is great at the Conrad!",5,2019,06,06
209,Excellent Luxury Hotel!!!,This hotel was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in during my visits to Europe.  Its a luxury Hotel with outstanding amenities that provides an elevated level of customer service. The pub at the lower level is a great place to relax and unwind at the end of the day.  Breakfast was very tasty with a large selection of breakfast items.  We didn't have any Euros and the front desk allowed us to exchange US dollars for Euros and gave us a great rate.  The entire experiences was first class all the way and I would definitely stay at this hotel the next time I go to Dublin.  I would highly recommend staying at this hotel.,5,2019,06,05
209,Great Choice!,We booked a room for the evening before we landed in Dublin so we would be able to access the room as soon as we arrived around 6 AM.  We were upgraded to a suite and promptly were escorted to the room where we had a wonderful rest after our flight from the USA.  We ate at the Coburg two nights as the food was excellent.  We enjoyed an Irish coffee after a day of sightseeing.  Excellent customer service from everyone.  I highly recommend it.  Also just a two minute walk from St Stephen's Green which leads you right into Grafton Street.  Perfect location for tourists unfamiliar with the area.,5,2019,06,04
209,Great Hotel and Staff.  Beautiful stay!,"Definitely a 5 star hotel.   Just got back from a 3 week vacation in Europe, spent 3 nights at the Conrad Dublin. After reviewing the trip, Conrad Dublin was #1 accommodations through the trip.   Staff, location, room were all great.  Buffet breakfast in the morning had many great offerings.  Housekeeping was exceptional.  Loved the location and park nearby. Lovely.  Hope to return soon.",5,2019,06,04
209,A wonderful place to stay in Dublin,"When we travel overnight to get to Europe, the most important thing for us is an early check in.  The front desk team at the Conrad not only provided accommodations at 10:00 AM, it was an upgrade with a great view of the Concert Hall.  The hotel is only a few minutes from St Steven's Green and Grafton Street.  Close enough to walk and far enough to be in a quiet location.  Breakfast was excellent and all of the servers charming and gracious. As a Hilton Honors Diamond member the hotel delivered a bottle of wine to our room.  We ate in one night and the wine made even some sandwiches special. Try a concert across the street.  Tickets are not expensive and the venue is excellent.",5,2019,06,04
209,"Very nice hotel, good breakfast,staff","Very well located hotel (1/2 block from St. John Green). The room was well appointed. The staff was very helpful, and the restaurant had a good complimentary breakfast (using my Hilton honors gold status). I would definitely rebook here if l return to Dublin.

H",4,2019,06,04
209,Dinner,"We chose this restaurant because it was walking distance from our Airbnb and the menu had options that fir all of us. Everyone ‘s food was delicious and the fish and chips were the best we had on our trip. They had a nice wine list and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The service was excellent. They were attentive without being intrusive. Our friends were treating their niece that had moved to Dublin for her masters degree and decided to stay for a year or so. She had never been there and she enjoyed it as well. I highly recommend this lovely hotel and their restaurant.

",5,2019,06,04
209,A Wonderful Hotel,"The hotel is beautiful, the staff outstanding and is very well located.  We could not have hoped for better service, ranging from a very early check-in to prompt room service to getting us a cab when we needed one.  I would stay there again in a NY minute!",5,2019,06,04
209,Excellent Customer Service,"I visited the hotel this week whilst on a business trip. Myself and a colleague were overloaded with bags etc and going out into the rain when approached by one of the guest relations team, James. 
James very kindly offered shelter with an umbrella and helped carry our bags to client offices just down the road. 
I can't thank James enough for his assistance. It really speaks volumes about how the hotel team value their customers.",5,2019,05,31
209,Good food and excellent service,Service is excellent through the hotel stay. The room service lobster roll is so good and was served within a short time even during peak lunch time. Great variety of breakfast buffet options but is almost the same daily so got a bit board towards the end of 3rd day. Love the Shanghai Tang toilette they offer in room.,4,2019,05,30
209,Great Hotel experience,"This hotel did a great job of taking care of my wife and I during our vacation.  The food was excellent, the staff was warm and welcoming and the room was very comfortable.  The place is also located close to Grafton street which is a great place to shop, eat and enjoy in general.  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone. ",5,2019,05,29
209,A class hotel in a class city,This is one of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed in. It’s a classy 5 star hotel with lovely staff and excellently well kept rooms and facilities. Loved the espresso machine in the room.  The USB ports were an excellent touch. I shall have to remember not fo bother bringing my range of chargers next time. I usually have some grip about a top class hotel but not this time. It ticked all the boxes and some more. I can’t wait to return to Dublin to stay here again. ,5,2019,05,22
209,"Well-kept, well-managed, well-located. Excellent hotel.","Wonderful, caring staff at all levels. Helpful emails with reservations manager and staff even before I arrived confirmed and improved my arrangements. Staff and facilities were great, and you can walk everywhere from this excellent location. Nice size room, well-furnished, and very comfortable beds. Good for vacationers and also for people doing business in Dublin. I definitely recommend it.",5,2019,05,21
209,weekend in Dublin,"average hotel for what they charge, location ok but better hotels available location and quality wise for same money, 
very noisy Saturday night which you can hear in your room til 2.00am
 bar down stairs has great selection of real ales ",3,2019,05,14
209,Great hotel,Outstanding hotel experience.  Staff and facilities are excellent. The location was in walking distance  of most of Dublins attractions.  This hotel is grezt for both busness trips and family stays.  Highly recommended.,5,2019,05,11
209,WHAT A BEAUTIFUL HOTEL,"Our first visit to Dublin.  When booking online, you never know what you may end up with.  WOW!  We were so impressed.  All the staff were very attentive and friendly.  Our room was elegant and beautiful.  The bed, after a 12 hour flight, we felt as if we were laying on a cloud, so comfortable.  We were more than pleased with our experience at this Hotel, and look forward to staying with them again on our next trip.  HIGHLY Recommend ",5,2019,05,07
209,Nice hotel but nothing spectacular.,Conrad Dublin hotel is located near the city center. It is a modern hotel with friendly and efficient staff. The hotel is a modern style with nothing to really set it apart other than its cleanliness and location. It is right across the street from the National Concert Hall and less than a block from St. Stephen's Green - a large historically significant park. Easy 757 bus ride to and from the airport for about 12 euros round trip and takes about 30-45 min depending on time of day.,4,2019,05,03
209,The Conrad in Dublin is a Luxury Hotel.,"The Conrad in Dublin is a Luxury Hotel.  After taking the train and ferry from London, they arranged for my wife and me to be picked up at the ferry port and driven to the hotel.  The driver met us in baggage claim and helped us with our bags.  When we arrived at the Conrad, our credit cards didn’t work (cabbie’s iPhone app?) and our driver wouldn’t accept British Pounds, so the doorman paid the driver.  What could have been an embarrassing moment was quickly resolved.  This is the kind of service I associate with a Luxury Hotel.  

We had three rooms, my wife and I in one, my youngest daughter and her husband in another and my oldest daughter in the third.  All were very nice.  Very comfortable beds, nice linens, nice pillows and soft fluffy towels.   The staff was very helpful arranging for cabs for our day trips and making pub suggestions.  Breakfast was very good.  The Conrad had the best coffee of our trip (served in a big French press), the best toast rack (the only toast rack) served with outstanding Irish butter and comfortable seating.  The bar was well stocked and served an excellent cocktail.  And the lobby is a very comfortable place to meet before heading out for a walking tour of Dublin.  

The Conrad is across the street from the National Concert Hall and a quick walk across St. Stephens Green to the busy shopping / pub section of Dublin.  This means is close enough to walk to most tourist attractions but it’s also quiet at night.  The Conrad is a comfortable hotel with a great breakfast, very friendly staff and quiet yet convenient location.  We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend the Conrad in Dublin.",5,2019,05,02
209,Absolutely outstanding 5 ⭐️,"Spent one night here during a Valentine’s Day get away and was amazed by the service. Nothing was too much bother, the room was modern with really nice toiletries and included a coffee machine which was topped up during our stay. The beds were so comfy and the shower was amazing! 

The breakfast made this whole experience one to remember and it’s by far the best I’ve ever come across. We were never rushed - in fact encouraged by staff to stay as long as we wanted and everything was perfect. Cooked breakfast, smoothies in small mini milk bottles, overnight oats. Toast and coffee was always freshly topped up at the table.

The staff at breakfast and at reception were wonderful, polite and nothing too much trouble. We even got given an extra few hours in our room on day of check out as we had a late flight. 

The best hotel I’ve stayed in. Would recommend to anyone worth every penny and more. Just wow. 

Thanks for an amazing valentines. 

Would give more than 5* if I could.
",5,2019,04,28
209,Great hotel with friendly and helpful staff.,The rooms are a good size and well-fitted out and a lovely bathroom.  Great breakfast and bar.  Very convenient for St Stephen's Green and the centre of Dublin.  Enjoyed our stay and the efforts of the staff.,5,2019,04,23
209,"Great staff and service, quiet location","The room was large, and spotless, with great amenities, including USB ports in the wall, meaning we didn't need the special adaptor we brought along (needed elsewhere). The staff was friendly, the bed oh so comfortable, the amenities (shampoo, soap, blankets, robes, towels, etc.) perfect.

We mentioned at check-in that we were traveling for our 20th wedding anniversary. Later that evening a complimentary bottle of wine, along with a platter of chocolates that had ""Happy 20th Anniversary"" spelled out in chocolate was delivery.  That's class and service, Conrad. Thank you.

Breakfast was excellent, with coffee served in a French press - yes, please! Lots of selections, from a traditional Irish breakfast to fruits and breads. 

The location is a bit out of the way of the major attractions, but quiet, and a very easy 7-10 minute walk over to Grafton Street, through Stephens Green.  Would absolutely stay here again.",5,2019,04,22
209,"Perfect location and perfect staff, equal perfect hotel for Dublin","From the minister we arrived until the minute departed the Conrad staff made us feel welcome and valued.  It is very easy for the staff at city centre hotels to become cool to the throngs, the Conrad staff destroy that thought and do everything in their power to make your stay outstanding.  We will return.",5,2019,04,20
209,Awesome stay in Dublin,"Had the opportunity to spend two full weeks in Dublin for work and the Conrad did an awesome job taking care of us. The amenities and nuances of the service are too many to individualize over the two week period, but it goes to say that the staff was very attentive to our needs.",5,2019,04,20
209,Stylish with Service ,"I am a Diamond member of the Hilton Group.  This hotel is one of the best I have stayed at and is a favourite.  The hotel is very stylish with well appointed rooms with good features for the business traveller. Very tasteful decor all backed up by knowledgeable, professional and personable staff.  Always on hand to help when needed.  

Whilst I was here on business I would have no hesitation in staying here for personal time. ",5,2019,04,17
209,Best stay ever!!!,"We went to Dublin for a 9 day stay.  The Conrad Dublin was truly amazing.  Location was fab, service was wonderful and we could not have picked a better place!!!  I was concerned as the price was a bit lower than other 5 star hotels in this area, I assure you there is no need to be.....IT WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!!  Enjoy your stay!!!",5,2019,04,15
209,Everything you want in a great hotel for a great price ,One night into a 3 night stay and could not be more impressed with this lovely hotel. Wonderful welcome and after an early start to our trip and flight they let us into the room at 11 am - unheard of in most hotels. Beautiful room hotel spotless staff courteous and helpful nothing is too much trouble. Already planning next trip back and won’t even consider other hotels. In love with Ireland and the people already ❤️,5,2019,04,13
209,Great location,"My first time staying in a hotel in Dublin (usually stay with family).
The Conrad is just beside Stephen’s Green, close to tram stops & the Aircoach drop off.

The hotel is what you’d expect of a top brand, lovely welcoming staff, great rooms & bathrooms, excellent breakfast.
The beautiful sculpture of birds ‘Peace Comes Dropping Slow’ has been removed while some construction work is being done, hope it comes back soon.",5,2019,04,12
209,Beautiful Hotel,"This is the second Conrad we have stayed at and we continue to be impressed with the brand.  We were upgraded to a king deluxe room and it was great to have an extra sitting area.  Much appreciated after the cramped room we just had in Edinburgh.

We took cabs to get around but I think there is public transport close by.  It isn’t walking distance to the tourist areas such as Temple Bar.  We were able to walk to St. Stephens Green and O’Donoghue’s.  It was raining while we were there so that limited our exploration of the area.

We ate at the pub and had a drink at the bar.  Both were good experiences.  The breakfast was excellent and the selection included anything you could possibly want.  The concierge was very helpful in arranging an excursion for us.  

The only unfortunate thing was that the hotel is undergoing renovation, so the view out our window was of a construction pit.
We only stayed for two nights, but would be happy to stay again when we are next in Dublin.",5,2019,04,09
209,Amazing experience!,"The staff , food, accomodations and location all made this a winner luxury experience!  I would recommend to all my friends and family!  A beautiful location just off St Stephens green and just a 20 min walk to just about location of interest in Dublin!",5,2019,04,09
209,Amazing Coburg Restaurant in Conrad Hotel,Just home from another wonderful stay in Hilton Conrad Hotel in Dublin. As always our stay was superb . The hotel is very centrally located and is really classy and very well priced for what it offers as the bedrooms are really lovely . However I cannot but mention the highlight for me was the quality and variety of delicious food served in the beautiful in house restaurant called Coburgs. Amazingly well priced to suit everyone’s pocket and the service is truly outstanding. We were served by a man called Eusebio who was simply superb at his job and really loves what he was doing. The food was so good and well priced that we ate there on the three evenings of our stay and we will be back soon again.Five Star food at four Star prices and 10 out of 10 for the service. You don’t have to be staying in the hotel to use the restaurant so call in and check it out and I can guarantee you that you will be pleasantly surprised!👍👍🍾🍾 Padraig Herlihy Castleisland Co Kerry April 2019,5,2019,04,05
209,Amazing!!!,"This hotel is absolutely gorgeous, and each and every staff member we encountered was warm and friendly, always willing to help.  The young man who checked us in was so kind and helpful, and the Concierge staff went out of their way to assist us.  The location is fantastic as well, we can't wait to return!",5,2019,04,04
209,Great Service and Room,"Since our arrival, we were treated with great attention.  I was very pleased with the way the staff went out of their way to assist us during our stay.  The room and bathroom were spacious and very clean.    ",5,2019,04,01
209,Dublin Spring trip,"This was the first time in Ireland for me.  My son has been here before, so he knew the city pretty well.  The hotel was very clean, the staff very friendly.  The on site restaurant was a little pricey.  The breakfast was excellent, however, the one staff member that was in charge of the area, needs to learn not to hover over guests while they are trying to look and choose what they want to eat.  He was trying a little too hard I think.    Our room was very clean and when we had issues with the coffee machine, they gladly came and helped.  The beds were very comfy as well.  I can't say enough about the staff.  Super friendly. ",5,2019,03,31
209,Fab hotel,"Second time staying here.
Fab location. Diagonally opposite top of Grafton st via st Stephens green. 
Rooms comfortable, clean and quiet.
Breakfast one of the best I’ve seen in Ireland.
Plenty of shops, restaurants and pubs around.
We’ll be back again...",5,2019,03,29
209,Highly recommended,"2 night stay for work and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Conrad.  Check in was efficient and staff was friendly and helpful.  Room was spacious and clean.  Highly recommended.  

I didn't eat here so can't comment on the food, but as the hotel has a high standard for everything else I would expect the food to continue this standard.
I didn't see or hear any building works mentioned in other reviews, not sure if they had finished when I stayed or if I was in another part of the hotel.
1st floor rooms have a balcony; higher floors don't but benefit from better views.",5,2019,03,28
209,Great staff,Very nice Hilton with a fantastic staff. Dave and Jimmy at front desk very helpful.melissa and Nicky in breakfast lounge very attentive. Try the waffles they are fantastic .very convenient to downtown area. Across from st Stephen's green ,5,2019,03,27
209,Excellent stay at the Conrad,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Conrad. The service at the restaurant and lounge were excellent and the front desk assisted us on several occasions with dinner and local travel. Highly recommended. ,5,2019,03,26
209,Dublin for St Pattys,Great hotel with excellent staff and amenities. Easy walk to pubs and shops. We loved it here. Food was good and so was the lounge bar and pub downstairs. Room was very comfortable with a large bathroom and shower. Great hotel experience. ,5,2019,03,26
209,Top notch!,"Convenient, top notch hotel just off St. Stephen’s Green. The Conrad Hilton was spotless, relaxing with extremely friendly, well trained staff! We stayed over St. Patrick’s Day and the hotel was at capacity. Lively lobby music, fun yet elegant bar off the lobby with knowledge and friendly staff! ",5,2019,03,24
209,St Paddy @Dublin Conrade.,"I loved the bar inside the lobby as well as the Pub downstairs.
The bartenders are very friendly . The cocktail waiterrses friendly as well. They were from Crotia. I believe the names were Helene and Dorothy which I am sure it’s short for their real names. Had a blast .",5,2019,03,21
209,Best experience in a hotel I've ever had,"From the moment my husband and I checked in, our experience at the Conrad Dublin was outstanding. The service was exceptional, the manager left a personally signed note in the room welcoming guests to the area for St. Patrick's Day. This was a nice touch that is not usually seen these days. Will absolutely stay again.",5,2019,03,21
209,Loreto Abbey Dalkey,Went for a pre show dinner last night as daughter was in the NCH with School. What a wonderful location with delicious food. Compliments to the chef. Was made feel so special by all the team in particular Niamh a Loreto girl herself and Shamera. Thank you so so much for your generosity and kindness. Definitely an outstanding hotel with great ambassadors for the company.,5,2019,03,21
209,St Patrick’s weekend,Nice hotel in a posh area. Close to parks and upscale bars and restaurants.  Will definitely stay again. Best part - sumptuous breakfast buffet. The restaurant in the basement is convenient for quick bites and drinks. ,5,2019,03,21
209,Conrad Dublin,"This is a great facility staffed with wonderful people. In a central location, it is a very comfortable way to visit Dublin. Food options in the hotel were very good as well, especially the food and staff of the breakfast.",5,2019,03,20
209,Saint Patricks week in Dublin,Our stay at the Conrad was perfect. The location near Saint Stephens Green was very convenient. The breakfast was outstanding and the staff at teh restaurant was even better. The maid service of our room was also excellent. It was a first class experience.,5,2019,03,20
209,Best Hotel Experience!,"The staff is 5 star alone. They were very accommodating to our needs and went out of their way to make sure we had everything We needed. Very clean hotel. Food was great. Walking distance to the beautiful st. Stephens green, grafton street area, temple bar etc. great restaurants. I would stay here again on my next visit to Dublin. Thank you to Michael and staff for being so wonderful!",5,2019,03,20
209,Decent Place,"This Conrad falls inside the business class standard. It doesn’t have much charm. Has a passable — barely — exercise room with old equipment. The rooms are okay, not great. Stayed in a suite that had a nice bath and decent bed. Room was in good shape. Nice service though like much of Dublin some on the front desk spoke English as a second language which made translating requests challenging but doable. Breakfast just fine but again not great. Don’t come here expecting anything other than a good hotel.",4,2019,03,17
209,Overnight stay,My second time here with lobby renovation completed . Fantastic city hotel and concierge are outstanding. Breakfast was included for my HH gold status and it was a 5-star worthy breakfast ! Highly recommend this hotel .,5,2019,03,13
209,A Special Experience,"One of the nicest hotel experiences I have ever had...the staff is so helpful and friendly, making this classy hotel a special experience...even the food in the restaurant is generally superior to most of the food I had around town. Strong recommendation from me!",5,2019,03,08
209,Not 5*,"Stayed for one night with a friend. Unfortunately there was more negatives than positives. 
The good:
Check in was efficient and the receptionist was lovely (apologies I didn’t get his name- french gentleman)
Dinner in the restaurant was lovely and the service was excellent. The onion soup was delicious but could have been hotter- it was only lukewarm 
The room was spacious, comfy beds and pillows. 

The bad:
We were woken at 6.45am by construction noise outside. Not just gentle noise, it was unbelievable! For a mid week break, to be woken this early is unacceptable. I understand that it isn’t the hotels fault as it isn’t their site, but some warning or at least a room away from it would have been what I would have expected from a 5* establishment 
Maintenence in the room was quite poor. Lots of scratches and dents on furniture, a door bolt that was missing, window latch that was nearly falling off and had splinters of wood all around it 
Breakfast was an odd affair. Restaurant wasn’t even half full and there was lots of staff on, but service was shocking. 10 minutes to get our coffee, toast was stone cold, the bacon ran out before we arrived down and was never replaced for the time we were there. The tomato and pudding on the buffet was barely warm and the little glasses of “fresh” fruit were horrendous 
No concierge or Porter was seen, no offer for assistance with bags, no attempt at a wow factor 

All in all, for the price paid and what we received I would not return. The Conrad is a basic 4* at best. Fur coat and no knickers comes to mind ",2,2019,03,07
209,Very relaxing,"My daughter and I stayed overnight in the conrad,the staff are lovely and very helpful,the room was bright and clean and the bed very comfortable, we had lunch which was delicious and that evening we had drinks In the lovely lounge which was very enjoyable,the hotel is in a good location and is only ten minutes  walk to grafton st,we would definitely  stay there again and I highly  recommend  it.",5,2019,03,06
209,Excellent service,"Really smart decor and superb staff, good food too! Good food, great staff, amazing location, staff, food, location, I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, decor! Staff! Food! Location! Comfy beds!",5,2019,03,03
209,Our style but could be better for the price,"We love staying here - our second visit. We love the location and the style of the hotel plus it has parking.
But Why let us have a room directly overlooking the building works with the associated noise? The hotel was half empty so can’t understand the logic. Anyway we were moved to another room away from the noise and as it turned out a better standard with the furniture laid out better. Bit put off by the scratched and chipped furniture in both rooms. Don’t expect that in 5 star. 
What really irritated me was the big wooden colonial wall covering which looked good but because of the slats had not been cleaned and was covered in dust. Not an easy thing to clean so who chose it? Obviously didn’t ask the cleaners opinion and is a big design flaw. also the pictures in the room that are optical illusions look awful - so many beautiful scenes of Ireland and Irish artists that you could have used 
Staff were delightful and responded to problems without hesitation 
Definitely would stay again",4,2019,03,01
209,Great location!,"My husband and I stayed at the Conrad Dublin for a week in late February.  First, we had a room on a high floor that was very nice.  There was construction on the other side of the hotel, and we were blessed with a room that was not near any of the noise. As one would expect from a Conrad, service was very good and friendly.  Our room was cozy, average size and appointed well.  The HVAC worked very well as did the shower, lighting, etc.  I am not sure what happened with the design of the room when it came to storage facilities.  We had two large suitcases which could not fit anywhere except next to the bed.  No room anywhere for suitcases.  Two small drawers were given for clothing and not much space in the closet, just open shelves.  Hmmm.  Aside from these little inconveniences, we enjoyed ourselves and slept well.  Breakfast was included, and delightfully, the young lady who sat us everyday remembered our names which was a nice touch.  Breakfast buffet was ample, with a nice hot/cold healthy choices.  The breakfast room faced the construction area which is in the courtyard of the hotel surrounds.  Interesting.  I am sure that the Conrad management will be happy when the construction ends.
Great location for walking all around Dublin.  A stone's throw from St. Stephen's Green and Grafton shopping area, we were delighted to spend hours discovering Dublin for the first time and then ending our day at the Conrad.",4,2019,02,27
209,Really redeemed themselves - a big thank you to Liam O’Halloran,"I wrote a very negative review of the Conrad Dublin in November 2016 as indeed did many others.  The Conrad then had a new management team who were intent on charging as much for as little as possible and as rudely as possible.  I am delighted to say that a new management team is in place and Liam O’Halloran is back now promoted to Hospitality Director.  Thanks very much for the warm welcome yesterday Liam, and also the tray of “goodies”.  For old timers who stayed at the Conrad and left now is the time to come back.  We were given a warm welcome this morning at breakfast.  Only one downside and I know you will address this Liam is the bar staff.  Whilst there is still some work to be done in training your bar staff how to interact politely with guests, and not deliberately overcharge guests, I am sure Liam will tackle this with great efficiency.  We also had dinner in the restaurant and it was absolutely delicious with great customer service.  Liam well done on transforming most of the hospitality staff as I noticed at breakfast ALL the staff were interacting with EVERYONE having breakfast and chatting pleasantly and making the lovely breakfast even nicer.  I am delighted to say that the Conrad has returned to the delightful hotel it used to be.  For all the folk who posted a bad review in recent years, now is the time to return",5,2019,02,27
209,Superb lunch,"Was invited to a lunch here on Friday 22nd February 2019 after a lunchtime concerto across the road so I can’t comment on the bedroom accommodation but the food, ambience and service were first rate.

Spotless toilets",5,2019,02,24
209,Very Nice Hotel,"This was a birthday treat, first time in Dublin - in fact first time in Ireland. I am glad we choose this hotel, very good location opposite the National Concert Hall and easy walking distance to the shopping and Temple bar areas.
Rooms are very comfortable and a good size, you just sink into the pillows !
Breakfast was small but seemed to have everything to offer, throughout the hotel all the staff were very friendly and always helpful.
This hotel comes highly recommended when in Dublin.",5,2019,02,23
209,Deserves every star,"Stayed here for a brief business trip and had a fantastic stay. 

As expected the cleanliness was great my room felt brand new. I had a deluxe room with comfy robes and slippers. The toiletries were good though if I’m being picky they could look at adding tooth brush and tooth paste like many of the other Hilton brands. 

The only other let down was the building work outside which woke me up as it started so early.

I had dinner in the restaurant which was delicious but breakfast was amongst the best I’ve ever had again with absolutely fantastic customer service.

The gym was great, super clean, great range of modern cardio equipment, weights and even TRX. 

Overall my stay was fantastic I felt refreshed heading to the office and is primarily down to their staff. I’d say they have better customer service that the Conrad in NYC which is saying something!

",5,2019,02,22
209,Super comfortable,"A very comfortable stay at this very pleasant hotel with an upscale vibe. 

Close to St Stephens Green and easy access to all parts of the city.

The bar is relaxed with great cocktails and all the staff throughout the hotel were friendly and professional.

Great breakfast too. I’ll certainly stay here again.",5,2019,02,21
209,Plush Hotel Near to Many Points of Interest,"The Conrad is in a good location, with plenty of interesting things to do within a short walk. The room itself was huge & in excellent condition, as are the common areas.
The only downside was the nearby building works, which could be heard early in the morning, but this was out of the hotel's control.",4,2019,02,17
209,Family Weekend,"What a lovely hotel.  We came to Dublin to celebrate my wife's 70th birthday with our two daughters and sons-in-law.  We had three adjacent rooms on the third floor and they were very spacious with all the facilities.  Large, comfortable bed, work desk and chair, tea/coffee facilities, large screen tv and a large modern bathroom.

The staff were so friendly and helpful.  We had breakfast included and also had bar lunches and a dinner.  All the food was good and we received extra special attention for my wife's birthday.

The hotel is well located, close to St Stephens Green and for us the perfect choice for our special weekend.",5,2019,02,14
209,Couple of nights in Dublin,"Check in was quick and staff were welcoming and informative.

Room - decent size, comfortable bed, large bathroom with bath and shower and everything you need for a short break (toiletries, robe, iron, etc.), my only grumble about the room was the coffee machine - very temperamental so sometimes struggled to use it.

The communal areas were all very clean and nicely presented.

Alfie Byrne's Pub - located on the lower ground floor served a good selection of beer and also had a nice atmosphere - pool table and food are also available.

Lemuel's Bar and Lounge - had a couple of drinks, the atmosphere and decor were nice, service was good but I would not order a cocktail again - it was bog standard, not served as described and not worth the money.

Overall its a very nice hotel but I would not stay here again - everything is within walking distance but its just I'd prefer to stay closer to the nightlife.",4,2019,02,13
209,Wonderful stay and the most friendly staff,"We had the most wonderful weekend at the Conrad, celebrating my Mum’s 70th birthday.  The hotel is in a great location, fairly central but tucked away from the noise and the rooms are so comfortable and beautifully furnished.  The food was delicious - we enjoyed a tasty lunch in Lemuels (highly recommend the lobster roll), a lovely meal in the Coburg, a wonderful afternoon tea and as for the breakfast - the choice and quality of items was amazing! But the icing on the cake was the staff - from reception, to the bar and the restaurant, everyone was so friendly and helpful and made sure our stay was memorable.  They must see thousands of guests every week, but somehow they make you feel that they are just here to look after you! They also went out of their way to make my Mum feel special on her birthday.  We wouldn’t hesitate to stay at the Conrad next time we visit Dublin! ",5,2019,02,12
209,Fabulous Hotel!,"My wife and I stayed at the Conrad during our visit to Dublin.  The hotel is located in a quiet part of town across the park from the busy area around Grafton street.  We loved the location and thoroughly enjoyed walking through the park each morning on the way to town.

The hotel itself is fabulous. Large rooms, immaculate common areas, superb service and a quiet elegance.  We would not hesitate to stay again on our next visit to Dublin!",5,2019,02,12
209,Fabulous Friendly and Fun,"We were welcomed with warm smiles and friendly charm at this lovely hotel.  Everything was just lovely.  We enjoyed three excellent nights of sleep in a good sized room with a very comfortable bed.  The room was air conditioned and peaceful.  The icing on the cake is the staff who are very attentive, friendly and also fun. Really good location in Dublin.  It was a wonderful stay, thank you so much.",5,2019,02,05
209,An excellent experience,"Starting from location, quality of services, facilities and staff, Conrad Dublin is a great property and I look forward to return for a business or leisure trip. The restaurant was excellent, too! Thank you to the team of Conrad Dublin. ",5,2019,02,05
209,Dining at the Conrad.,"Went into the restaurant first, nobody there.  The menu was miserable, couldn't find anything to eat, so we decided to go down stairs to the Pub and have pub grub.  It was also terrible.  The hotel itself is beautiful, but if you want food go somewhere else.",5,2019,02,05
209,Wasnt overly impressed,"Stayed 1 night due to attending a function in town last Thursday night 31st January 2019. I arrived at 1pm and was met by a male trainee receptionist who was extremely nice and polite but needed guidance throughout the check in process(understandable but surely an experienced member of staff should have been shadowing him on a busy Thursday). During check in a lady arrived over and asked, abruptly, without introducing herself ""are you a hilton reward member"". I answered ""no"" and she literally walked off without saying another word!! She was a foreign lady with long straight hair coloured at the ends. I found her quire rude and she set a bad tone for my stay.
The room I found very cold and it took a long time to heat up, I stay in 5star hotels throughout the world and have never had this problem.
I went for lunch in the bar and ended up sending my soup back which was cold. Also orders mixed up!
Breakfast was a bit better to be fair but the hotel in general is streets behind the Westbury/Shelbourne and Merrion despite costing the same. I attend this hotel with family regularly to dine and when asked by my wife would we stay there next time in when in town you can imagine my response.
Gym is actually very nice and modern.",3,2019,02,04
209,"Excellent Hotel, Excellent Location","To maximize your experience in Ireland particularly Dublin the Conrad Hilton is the place to stay.  Close to major landmarks, restaurants and shopping. Truly a great location to enjoy this international city. ",5,2019,02,01
209,Classy Hotel,"We had a wonderful time here recently for a family event. As well as being a very stylish hotel, all the staff are really friendly from the moment you walk in the door. Our meal was perfect for the celebration (50th wedding anniversary) and I think the happy couple were delighted with all the special attention they got from the waiters. We all stayed overnight and loved the rooms - very cool/modern decor. Personally, the best thing about the stay was the amazing bed. Best night's sleep in a long time. Second best thing is the breakfast. Anyone who's stayed there will tell you. You'll have to search long and hard to find a better Full Irish!",5,2019,02,01
209,"Great hotel, with luxury service!","This hotel is perfectly located close to great restaurants, and nearby good walking and jogging parks. The facilities are luxurious, and well maintained by their very very friendly staff!

Great place to stay, and gives good value for money!",5,2019,02,01
209,Great hotel ,I visit Dublin regularly and as a loyal Hilton customer work my way round the options in Dublin. By way of availability ended up at Conrad hotel last night . Excellent - my new favourite hotel in Dublin . Every thing is high qu,5,2019,01,29
209,Lovely break,"Spent a night recently in Conrad Hotel and what a lovely experience from time of arrival to departure. Found all staff...reception,lounge , Coburg Restaurant and room turn down staff to be so pleasant and helpful and in particular Guest Relation Manager Liam. I had a beautiful room looking out onto Earlsfort Terrace and had a wonderful nights sleep as surrounds were so quiet and bed so comfortable. I had a drink in lounge which was very busy (pre theatre) but lovely ambience. Dinner in Coburg Restaurant was excellent as was breakfast the following morning. The Conrad is a super location in quiet area but a quick walk through adjacent Stephens Green has you in the buzz of Grafton Street in minutes. I would definitely recommend  the Conrad to anyone looking for a wonderful hotel experience in the heart of Dublin.",5,2019,01,27
209,Fabulous Stay,"Fantastic stay! Staff were extremely friendly & helpful. Food was very good. 
WiFi had an extremely impressive speed. 
Such a Relaxing atmosphere in this hotel, even though you are in the midst of the city.
Great value. Look forward to returning.",5,2019,01,26
209,Fantastic,"Fantastic, great service and dinning area. Staff is extra friendly and always available. Minimal people traffic in the hotel so feels peaceful and relaxing. Gym was well equipped for our morning work out",5,2019,01,25
209,"Conrad Dublin, best luxury accommodation in Dublin","I usually stay in other 5 star properties in the city but decided to give Conrad a try as I hadn't been there for some time, Just arriving at this beautiful hotel, it is clear that it had undergone an extensive refurbishment programme as everything looked modern and luxurious.Check in was quick and easy and allowed us time to grab a cocktail or two in the new lounge bar before we headed to the room. A young and eager bar tender provided us with nibbles and banter before we headed out for the evening. The location couldn't be any better, with only 10 minutes walk to the heart of Grafton Street. Upon our return, we met lots of other residents and chatted over some bubbles as they were celebrating a birthday. The night bar is great with a great atmosphere and stays open late when other bars are shut! Breakfast was an activity in itself. The attentive staff ensured we had everything we needed and my cousin who is gluten free had lots of choice on the scrumptious buffet. Having stayed a little longer at breakfast, mulling over the crisp newspapers available, I had to check directions to our next stop. Thanks to a knowledgable concierge who provided me with a map and a bottle of water for the car, we headed off. It is clear standards have been set high by the management team here and the staff really enjoy working there. Cant wait to return to this fabulous hotel...you will not be disappointed. I found best offers are direct via their website.",5,2019,01,24
209,20th wedding anniversary celebration,"My wife and I celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary recently. As a special treat I thought I would surprise my wife with a stay in the Conrad Dublin. We were greeted on arrival by a very friendly receptionist and it was very apparent that she was enjoying her work. We were upgraded to a premier king room which had a super view of the Dublin skyline. The room was very spacious, spotless, modern and beautifully decorated. We had bath robes, slippers (that actually fit men!), Nespresso coffee machine, complimentary water, turn down bed service (with chocs), complimentary overnight shoe shine service (I couldn't avail of this with my suede shoes!), complimentary newspapers & much more. The bed and pillows in particular were incredibly comfortable. It was just a fantastic experience from start to finish! The hotel is also very well situated, it is in short walking distance to prime shopping areas including Grafton Street. I could not recommend this hotel more, we cannot wait to return!",5,2019,01,24
209,You must stay here,"There aren’t enough good things I can say about our stay here. Between the staff, the rooms, the food and the location, we loved our time here!! The staff was beyond kind, the food was great and the location can’t be any better! ",5,2019,01,23
209,Best 5* hotel in Dublin,"Best hotel in Dublin. They make such a fuss about children, making them feel so special. The hotel decor is exquisite yet it doesn’t feel too stuffy. Staff are very friendly. We had a lovely lunch on arrival and dinner there that evening. The Coburg does a great steak and again service excellent. Our breakfast was the best hotel breakfast I’ve had in a long time and then we got to stroll thru the green and be in the heart of the city. Perfect hotel stay from start to finish. Can’t wait to go back!",5,2019,01,23
209,One night stay #brill,"Stayed one night in the Conrad recently and service/room was fab. Perfect location for city centre exploring but still very quiet at night. Room was immaculate and had great amenities. Staff very friendly and helpful, smiles all round! Would defo recommend and will be staying here again!",5,2019,01,23
209,Loved it!,"Beautiful hotel with friendly and efficient staff, loved the whole experience! Love that it's so central and close to everything but also in a quiet location. Perfect for a visit to the National Concert Hall which is just across the road.",5,2019,01,22
209,Great Trip ,"Great location off St Stephens green with short walk to Grafton St.
Fantastic staff very friendly and welcoming.

Comfortable rooms,clean and that bit of luxury.

Dined in restaurant and had a great G&T in the Bar.  

Great for trip with friends  ",5,2019,01,19
209,Outstanding Service,"This is the first in a while I have been to a hotel and been wowed.  From the minute you walk in, service at check in and check out - it was outstanding.

Room was clean, big & spacious.  Breakfast the next morning plentiful.

Coffee Machine (nespresso) in the room along with water etc.

The towels were proper luxurious towels! 

I have found my new fav hotel in Dublin.  Will be back! ",5,2019,01,19
209,Anniversary dinner,Had a great evening with my wife for our 28th marriage anniversary. The meal was exceptional and the staff were very attentive and professional. They had a good selection of wines as well. Will be coming back for sure.,5,2019,01,19
209,Great event at the Conrad ,Had a fantastic evening in the main function room at the Conrad. My friend and I both have special dietary requirements and our server Kelly made sure to look after us with no problem whatsoever which is rare at high volume events such as this. We didnt have to ask for our courses as they came to us first. All in all a fantastic venue with an even better team of staff. ,5,2019,01,18
209,2 great visits,"Having stayed in the Conrad 18 months ago when in dublin it was easily our top choice for this trip. It's ticks all the boxes in relation to comfort, location and grandeur. This time round the hotel was even better than we remembered. We were greated at the door by a lovely friendly gentleman who took our bags. The reception staff were so friendly and efficient. The lady we dealt with was very welcoming giving us plenty of information about the hotel and all the time taking interest in our little girl. She even rang ahead to housekeeping to double check everything we would need for the baby would be in the room and it was. As new parents it is brilliant to have that reassurance from the moment you go in the door. Our room was impeccable and the beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept on. Udb charge points at both sides of the bed a big hit with us!!! Over the course of our stay we have eaten in both the bar and the restaurant. The food in the restaurant is out of this world. The bar is also amazing amd a slifhtly more relaxef setting. The selection at breakfast was unbelivable and everything was so plentiful and fresh.... we saw both extremes going for breakfast one morning at 7.30 and the other at 10... there was no rush at either times and plenty of selection.i loved the look of the afternoon tea but couldn't persuade my partner to go so i have to arrange a shopping trip with the girls at a later stage!!! The staff were efficient and friendly with most of them remembering our little girls name from one day to the next. One of the managers even stopped to talk to her as she reminded him of his niece.... we swapped stories about all the little things they were doing...It's all the small touches that make a difference. We will definitely be going back to the Conrad Dublin.",5,2019,01,15
209,"Pleasant hotel, uneven service","I booked a one night stay as a continuation of a business trip, to enjoy some of Dublin’s cultural highlights. The Conrad is well-situated - close enough to walk to the city centre, but away from the tourist hordes. The room was comfortable, and the bed was terrific. A lounge chair would have been nice, as there was plenty of empty space. But the real challenge was in the restaurant service. I went to two of the restaurants, and found on three occasions I had great difficulty in getting the staff to acknowledge me. I sat in the bar, and kept trying to flag down several waitresses, who went straight past me as of invisible. Similar problem trying to get someone to seat me for breakfast. Strangely noticeable gap in the overall quality of the experience.",4,2019,01,12
209,My favorite hotel in Dublin,"The location is perfect, the service is top class, rooms are great and so is the food. I’ve stayed there many time and it has become a kind of home away from home for me. It is situated across the road from the National Concert Hall and is the perfect location for somebody visiting the city for a concert. ",5,2019,01,12
209,Entrance ,The entrance to the hotel is nice. And the breakfast was absolutely delicious. It’s one of the best breakfasts I had in Dublin. We didn’t stay there for a long time thought. Please continue like this.,5,2019,01,12
209,Surprised with the poor service,Probably one of the worst Conrads i have stayed. Quality of service and hotel staff was poor. Breakfast service was also very poor. The hotel staff is unwelcoming and no one wants to smile. Sorrybut not staying here anymore. Giving them 2 stars for location.,2,2019,01,11
209,"Could be better ,,","I stayed at the Conrad for one night 23Rd December 2018 , and was disappointed by a number of things , firstly the toilet seat was broken , hanging off its hinges , the room was clean but a tad small for a so called 5 star hotel . Also there was no turndown service , something I would expect again from this “5 Star “ hotel , I ordered cocktails at the bar, and they were tiny ! And very disappointing, there is also a charge for WiFi , which will be deduced from the bill on checkout ! Really come on it’s 2019 ! Sort it out ,, 
Finally to add insult to injury my credit card was charged Twice !! 
This is not good ! Hilton should get it’s act together,,
I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone.",2,2019,01,11
209,Amazing hotel,"This hotel is fantastic, from rooms to restaurant and bar, and I particularly enjoyed the big bath in the room!

Me and a friend had several coffees and drinks in the Lounge bar. the young blonde guy was very attentive and made great cocktails!

Only thing I would say are the chefs choice of mini desserts are just too small.

The meal in the restaurant was superb. Guinness and onion soup was just out of this world, so many different textures and flavours! Steaks were cooked perfectly too.

The hotel has a great 24/7 gym which I found useful.

Staff were all pleasant and helpful throughout the stay.",5,2019,01,10
209,Great Hotel with fantastic restaurant and very friendly staff,"Just about to leave from a 3 night stay at this hotel.  It has been an absolute pleasure to stay here. Everything just works.  Rooms are nice and spacious. Staff is ver yfriendly and attentive. And the hotel restaurant, ""The Coburg"" is one of the best hotel restaurants that I have ever visited. Thanks for a great stay.",5,2019,01,10
209,5🌟,"We went for a quick 2 night stay in Dublin. As soon as our taxi arrived at the door we were greeted and our luggage was taken from us to the check in desk. We were nicely greeted and assigned a room, his co-worker came over and assisted him and assigned another room that I heard him say and then eventually a different room number was written on the card. Hmmm not sure what that was all about. When we arrived at our room there was a young man finishing up some maintenance. He said he was finished and gathered up his things. During the maintenance he forgot to put the aerator back on the sink faucet. Him and his colleague were still working in our hallway on other rooms so we got him and he put it back on. (We need a wrench to get it on. This is why we didn’t just do it ourselves). None of this was a big deal. We walked from our hotel. We found 15-20 minutes of walking to tours and restaurants not a big deal. The room was very clean and tidy. Double sink, separate shower and bath as well as the toilet. Lots of amenities available. There was turn down service with chocolates on the bed when we returned for the night. The breakfast was part of our stay for being Diamond Hilton members. I enjoyed it very much. You can eat from the buffet as well as order things off the menu that were included. The staff...all 5⭐️. Super nice, get you what you want. We also had lunch after we arrived downstairs at the pub. My soup was delicious as well as the vegetable sandwich with bean spread, I would go back for that sandwich. Lots of draft beers. We both did a flight. Unfortunately we didn’t care for the beers there. Oh well, that’s what trying is all about. They don’t have Guiness or Jameson which I thought was funny since it was the first place we went and I couldn’t get the “real” experience. Lol. Highly recommend this hotel! ",5,2019,01,03
209,Lovely hotel,"Very nice hotel. In a great location not far from Temple Bar (15 min walk) and not too close to all of the craziness of the touristy area.

Staff is friendly, breakfast buffet has nice offerings and the bartenders were lovely as well.

Only wish they had a spa!",5,2019,01,01
209,this is a great hotel,"I have been a Hilton diamond member for the past 15 years so I stay in alot of Hilton Hotels. I have stayed in the Dublin Conrad before a few times, but not since it has been renovated. Wow they have done a great job. Our room as great. The lobby is funky, the bar is great and has personality and the breakfast was truly fantastic - and the breakfast room staff were as good as you get. All in all, a really fantastic hotel and I would highly recommend it.",5,2019,01,01
209,"Quality Hotel, 5* touches make the difference","we had two stays in the Conrad recently, and i would highly recommend the hotel, depending on the room rate of course. We enjoyed a discounted rate for one of the stays and the second was using hilton points. Some of the advertised rates are very expensive, meaning you should compare the Shelbourne nearby.

The room was very comfortable, with several nice touches, including the umbrella, which was required.

The staff from check in to check out were very professional - that said, concierge  did try and 'persuade' me that I had to use valet parking as the barrier was down, only to then say it's ok, i'll open the barrier!

We look forward to returning, if the price is right.",4,2018,12,31
209,Beautiful Modern Hotel in Dublin!,My wife and I stayed for our honeymoon for three nights. We were greeted very warmly and courteously by the staff at reception (shout-out Ciara!) and upgraded to a junior king suite (HH Diamond Member). The staff also placed some chocolate covered strawberries to mark the occasion which was a pleasant detail! Beautiful bar (Lemuel’s) and awesome staff made our 3 nights unforgettable. Location is within a 15-20 minute walk from everything hip and happening in the city. Would definitely stay again!,5,2018,12,26
209,Conrad Dublin poor,"Hotels facilities, food, drinks are good but some of the staff are not up to 5 star hotelservice. Location is everage not very convenience with shops or supermarket, take about 15 minute to walk to grafton Street and there aren’t many shops on the way to grafton Street just the park (which quite dark and close after hours) ",1,2018,12,24
209,A Very Special Stay,"My family (wife, two daughters and partners) stayed at the Conrad this weekend to mark a milestone. I have nothing but praise for our stay which was simply perfect. The location is stunning, the parking easy, the staff were some of the most professional and friendly you will ever encounter. 

On Friday evening we had a stunning family meal in The Croburg... nothing, not ONE thing, was less than perfect.

This visit will last long in my memory...thank you all for the work you do in creating memories 

",5,2018,12,23
209,Highly recommended,"I spend on average a hundred nights a year in hotels. This stay truly stood out, hence I would like to take the time to review.

I took my mother for a weekend in Dublin (First recommendation, really appreciated) and we decided to stay at the Conrad.

The hotel is very well maintained and clearly in a great shape. The rooms are spacious and light, the bedlinen ultra soft and the wide range of amenities outstanding.

What this hotel clearly stands out in is the human aspect. From the driver, James, who collected us at the airport. To the wonderful team at breakfast, who made us smile every morning and remembered even the tiniest details of our preferences.

From a location point of view you can’t get better. It is a very luxurious area and all the main ‘tourist spots’ are within walking distance.

My favorite moment after a long day of sightseeing was the cocktail in Lemuels bar, very stylisch décor and fantastic drinks!

I can’t wait to get back to Dublin (Especially since the Guiness tastes really better there) and I will recommend all my friends and family to stay at the Conrad!

Thank you Martin and your team for doing an amazing job.",5,2018,12,20
209,5 Star dining,"My Wife and I recently had the pleasure of dining at the Coburg restaurant in the Conrad.The atmosphere was perfect, contemporary and comfortable. Staff were genuinely friendly and very helpful. They made us feel special from the moment we entered the impressive foyer of the hotel. The menu was extensive and surprisingly well priced for such an up market establishment.Portion sizes were perfect and prepared to requested requirements. We both had the fillet steak for main course cooked medium. I would strongly recommend the Coburg to anyone looking a five star dining experience.",5,2018,12,19
209,Friends Christmas night away in Dublin!,"I would have to say we stay in lots of hotels but always love to get back to the Conrad. The staff are so wonderfully, friendly and helpful and the hotels locate is perfect! A mere five minute walk to the shops whilst also quietly tucked away from the hustle and bustle!  We checked into the hotel on Saturday 8th December and again had a beautiful room, classic yet extremely cosy. I promise you will sleep like a baby in their beds the duvets and pillows are both light and fluffy, I wish I could bring it home with me !!
We booked dinner in their restaurant Coburg and had a gorgeous meal, The menu has a little bit of everything and is well priced.
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2018,12,18
209,Luxurious hotel with fantastic staff,"I stay in Dublin regularly on business so am familiar with a lot of the 4 and 5 star hotels, but this was my first time staying at The 5 star Conrad Hotel (a Hilton Hotel). From the moment I arrived the porter took my bags, and after a swift check in, I dropped my bags in my fabulous deluxe double room, and I literally stayed put for the next 24 hours! I was attending 2 private events - a meeting followed by a small Christmas party of 30 people. The meal was lovely, and whilst I always tend to keep my reviews as positive as possible, I have never in my life seen such tiny portions of food at any hotel, 5 star or otherwise. Let me also say that I am a person who enjoys quality rather than quantity when it comes to food, but these portions were noticeably tiny. I couldn't take photos as I was with clients but suffice to say, unfortunately, I was actually really hungry after a 4-course meal! 

I ate in the hotel twice more after the client lunch - I had dinner that evening in the main restaurant, which was absolutely mouth-watering (I had Venison) and it was worth every cent. Breakfast was also lovely the following morning, with very attentive, friendly, and professional staff.

If you are a tourist, it is a great location, very central, 100M from St Stephens Green where you can feed the ducks, or soak up the atmosphere of Georgian Dublin nearby, or walk another 100M to the main shopping district of Grafton St, and another few minutes walk from one of Dublin's landmark buildings, Trinity College (where you'll find The Book of Kells). 

Bottom line: Would I stay here again? Yes, definitely! Fabulous hotel. Great staff, luxurious rooms, and very comfortable beds - it was the best nights sleep I had in years!",5,2018,12,17
209,Luxury ,"Fabulous hotel - great ambiance, comfortable lounge/bar area - Lunch was delicious, great breakfast with terrific choice of produce.
Room was SO comfortable and well presented.
The staff were extremely friendly and helpful 
Great location for Grafton St",5,2018,12,12
209,Second stay - another wonderful experience!,"I had another business trip to Dublin, and booked the Conrad for my 4 night stay. I look forward to the stay - from the comfortable rooms and beds, the delicious breakfast and lovely cocktail lounge. I was not disappointed! I had a very nice stay, and enjoyed the hospitality of the Conrad. I look forward to my next visit.",5,2018,12,12
209,Nice Hotel for a weekend stay,"Great hotel, great service and room was nice and modern. Check in was quick and easy and front staff was very nice.

The bed itself though wasn't the most comfiest Conrad bed I've had, too firm for my taste. Other Conrad's i've stayed at have MUCH more comfier beds. Also the shower in the bathroom is quirky doesn't have a fully enclosed shower, so I would spray water everywhere on the floor. 

Location of the hotel is fantastic though, you're able to walk to everything and not worry about having to drive or even take a bus. Also I think the highlight of the hotel was the breakfast. OMG sooooo luxurious! Great buffet spread and you can order eggs made to order. Also the coffee comes in a individualized french press and the fresh squeezed orange juice was DIVINE!!!!

One thing I was kind of dissappointed in was that a hotel at this calibar does not have an EXECUTIVE LOUNGE as a diamond member its nice to be able to go into an executive lounge to relax and escape and enjoy a beverage throughout the day. To make it up, the front desk did give me two drink vouchers to go use at the bar, but it was only for a beer or house wine. Kind of stingy, if I were to say so myself. I couldn't even order a cocktail with it and when I tried to use it at the bar, the waitress kind of gave me an attitude and look. At least make the vouchers be good for any beverage, to make it seem like you are less frugal.

Overall I would stay here again though!",4,2018,12,04
209,Xmas party season,"Good hotel, friendly staff, ideally placed for central Dublin. Don’t bother paying for breakfast though! Absolutely dreadful, soggy streaky bacon, dehydrated sausages, petrified black and white pudding and eggs you could play ice hockey with (they resemble a bloody hockey puck!) we were charged for this and truthfully we would have been better going to a nice cafe instead and saved some money.  Other than that a nice stay!",4,2018,12,01
209,Excellent!,"I can not say enough great things about our stay at the Conrad in Dublin! The location was excellent! Just far enough away from the crowds and noise, but within walking distance to all the bars and shopping! The staff was truly top notch and the facility was exceptionally clean. I will forever cherish our late night conversations at the bar with the hotel staff. Thank you for an amazing stay!",5,2018,11,28
209,Nice hotel with a nice bar,This is a nice hotel in Dublin with a frendly and very helpful staff. The bar is also nice. Nice room and everthing where good with our stay here. Only one thing negative is i thing the price for breakfast where to expencive.,4,2018,11,28

209,Excellent,"Great location with easy access to everything.  Rooms and beds a bit smaller than expected.  Front desk, cleaning and turn- down teams excellent.  Restaurant teams for breakfast and dinner...phenomenal!  Everyone greeted you with a smile and was always willing to help.  ",5,2018,11,26
209,Beautiful Hotel located in the heart of Dublin,The Conrad is beautiful hotel located a short walk from St Stephen's Green in the center of Dublin.  The hotel has a classic luxury appearance and feel.  Staff are professional and helpful.  Great base for enjoying all Dublin has to offer.,5,2018,11,26
209,Very nice stay ,"Arrived for a weekend stay got checked in quickly and had a nice room but no view from the windows 
The room was large well equipped a little on the modern style
The bar was good plenty of seats and the service was good as well 
We did not have dinner in 
Breakfast we good with lots to choose from 
Will be going back 
",5,2018,11,25
209,My second stay here.  Love this hotel.,"Really lovely place.  Close to St. Stephen's Green, a tranquil and scenic Dublin park.  The restaurant is very good and reasonable.  The breakfast has everything you could want; great buffet or menu ordering.  Immaculate and quiet room, restful bed, spacious bathroom.  Staff is helpful and really pleasant.  Two nice areas for cocktails.  The hotel is out of the hustle and bustle but within walking distance of museums, pubs, restaurants, cash machine and small food and liquor mart.",5,2018,11,24
209,Overall amazing but what about the pancakes?,"This is a lovely Conrad! Calm, quiet, relaxing and clean. The rooms are very nice, spacious enough and very comfortable. The staff, especially the doormen, are all nice and helpful. The location is great. The pub in the basement is very nice.  We have stayed here many times and always loved it. On our last visit however we were very disappointed when we discovered they had decided to remove the pancakes from the Diamond/buffé breakfast. For all of us traveling with kids - that is the one thing kids look forward to at hotels: pancakes for breakfast. And yes, we can buy them, but at EUR 11 for two tiny pancakes and several kids, that is not reasonable. So why would Conrad so blatantly disregard their younger guests? Pancakes are cheap to make, why take that one joy away from the kids? The breakfast is lovely, but apart from those pancakes, it is all grown up food, lox, cheese etc. So please put the pancakes back on the buffé and make all kids happy. And please add some yoga mats to the gym.

That said, this Conrad is a great property and we have very much enjoyed our stays here.",5,2018,11,23
209,Comfortable and relaxing stay,"Stayed at the Conrad for one evening whilst on Business. Room was large and spacious with a very comfortable bed. Room was also very quiet for an uninterrupted sleep.

Numerous facilities in room and a large bathroom.

Breakfast choice was excellent with both buffet and full service included.

",5,2018,11,19
209,Afternoon tea. Nicoleta was fantastic.,"Afternoon tea in the Conrad immeasurably improved by the wonderful service of Nicoleta the waitress in the bar. Absolutely charming and brilliantly attentive.
Great tea selection. Food was generally good. Thank you!",5,2018,11,18
209,"Superb, low-key hotel","The hotel staff is very welcoming and helpful, the rooms are roomy, clean and nicely furnished, and the breakfast room is an incredibly pleasant place to dine. The location is a 10-15 minute walk from the busier areas of Dublin, which is plus if you don't like stepping out the front door into the city's action. The doormen can quickly hail a cab for you, and several bus lines stop a block away if you're up for public transportation. The room amenities are quite nice, and the breakfast room includes both buffet and made-to-order items. I particularly liked the locally sourced jams - they were tasty, and showed off the attention-to-detail you'll see throughout the hotel. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, or to recommend it to family, friends and colleagues.",5,2018,11,17
209,Clean and quiet,My husband and I were in a short trip. Location and sleep were priorities. The Conrad was clean and quiet and right in the middle of everything. We had a lovely stay. The breakfast was very nice. Would stay again!,5,2018,11,16
209,First class hotel,"This hotel is beautiful and modern with all the amenities in room you would need or want.  The bed linens were so luxurious, I forgot to ask where to buy them!  Staff is fantastic.   The breakfast buffet was delicious and had everything you could imagine.  The location is a 5 minute walk through beautiful Stephens green park to Grafton street.
I would definitely stay at this property again,",5,2018,11,15
209,Business,"Excellent hotel. Stay at the top floor with view of the office building next to it. The do not have executive lounge though, I would rate 5 if have one. Lovely breakfast and the staff are friendly too. ",4,2018,11,15
209,Overall solid experience,"- Fairly central location
- Very friendly staff, but could be a bit more attentive in restaurant at breakfast time (e.g. trying to take orders from several tables)
- Overall good renovation status
- Rooms are nice, but windows not isolated. Thus, very cold near windows at this time of the year, and the rest of the room is slightly too warm (including water temperature in bathroom). So creating a somewhat uneven experience.",4,2018,11,14
209,Overall a good trip,"Was good except for the inability to get food after returning from a concert, when the front desk had given us hours that were incorrect.  Other than that, it was a good location, a couple of blocks walk to shopping. ",5,2018,11,12
209,Top tier stay without the price,"Attention to detail and stellar customer service earns this hotel these high marks. The staff is friendly, professional, courteous, and mindful of their guests' time. The front desk/door is well staffed with knowledgeable, solution-focused smiling faces, there to help you with anything. Our stay was particularly appreciated since we flew overnight and we able to check in upon arrival, hours before the designated time. The staff organized cabs, a breakfast before the restaurant opened on one particularly early excursion morning, directions and help. The physical plant was high-end, immaculate and tastefully decorated.  It felt like a Four Seasons stay without the bill.  Conveniently located, though you do have to walk through - or around at night - St. Stephen's Green, to get to the heart of the city. It was away from the chaos of Temple Bar and close to a Starbucks and public transportation. ",5,2018,11,12
209,Great service makes it 5-Star worth,"We stayed one night at Conrad Dublin as a family. I have to be honest the first impression of the property wasn’t all that great compared to other Conrads we’ve stayed elsewhere. 

However as it turned out the service makes the difference. The staff were very attentive to details. We didn’t see the signature stuffed animal in our room after check-in. The front desk explained they were out of stock. But they promised to mail us one as soon as they restock the stuffed lambs. And sure enough shortly after we got home we received the Lammy in the mail. 

Thanks for your outstanding service that made our Dublin visit a memoriable one.",5,2018,11,10
209,Looks fab on the surface but quite a few small irritating issues,"I stayed here for one evening and from the minute you arrive it looks as if it is really worthy of it's 5* rating.  Food in the Coborg Restaurant was good, as was the service.  Meeting rooms were fine, although we did have to request lots of 'extras' that I thought should have been thought about in advance, so extension leads, etc.

The room was lovely, well appointed and everything you could want - except my room on the 1st floor was just above the underground car park - and when someone left at 3am I was woken but the very noisy roller shutters opening, then again at about 03:20 when the recycling truck arrived, and again at 05:00 - for future just leave them open - it has to be better than a very disturbed sleep.

Breakfast was a little chaotic, and not just for me it seems.  I ordered poached eggs on toast - so was served the toast but not the eggs, then got both - unfortunately the eggs were hard - which is never great and not what I would have expected.

So I give it a 3 start rating - would I stay again - possibly but would probably look for something else given the price tag of the room rate here.",3,2018,11,09
209,Can´t be better!,"I have stayed for 2 days and everything was absolutely perfect. Havent been in a hotel where I have been treated that well. Everyone was so professional, but I want to mention that the croatian lady from reception was supeb! Congrats!",5,2018,11,08
209,Amazing hotel ,"My wife and I stayed here recently for my birthday.
It was a wonderful experience, the room was luxurious and well appointed.
The staff were brilliant, so welcoming and accommodating. I’m already looking forward to returning ",5,2018,11,05
209,Beautiful hotel in central location,"Stayed in the Conrad for 1 night recently and loved it. The decor is gorgeous, and the reception and bar area are to a high standard,. Staff are very pleasant from check-in, to bar, to restaurant. Our room was on the 3rd floor, and was very spacious and comfortable. I found the mattress slightly hard for me, but the duvet and pillows were extremely comfy. Robes and slippers are provided in-room, as are all toiletries you could need in the bathroom. A slight negative for me was I found the curtains weren't quite able to keep the room dark, so when it got light in the morning, it woke me. Breakfast is tasty with a great selection of items. There is a carpark onsite which guests can use for €20 per 24 hours; and the location is brilliant - less than 1 minute walk to Stephen's Green. Would recommend this hotel if you're looking for high-standard accommodation in a central location in Dublin.",4,2018,11,05
209,Pre Theatre Dinner,"The hotel is excellent and extremely well located. With the National Concert Hall across the street, we booked dinner in the brasserie restaurant. The pre theatre menu proved an excellent choice, with me enjoying a ribeye & Herself the sea bream. A pasta dish was also on offer. Minutes after leaving, we took our seats at the Concert Hall. Our hotel room was comfortable and the staff a pleasure to meet.",5,2018,11,04
209,Wow!,"Stayed at the Conrad while in town to run the marathon. Wow! The place is impeccable, the staff professional and helpful and the daily breakfast buffet was perfect. From the Nespresso machine to the big screen television to the free and working wifi, I was never so happy to return to a hotel room after a day of sightseeing. The deep bathtub was especially welcoming after finishing the race. It was also cool to see many of the elite runners, including the race winner, staying at this hotel. Many of best attractions are within walking distance. If I ever go back to Dublin, I would definitely choose the Conrad.",5,2018,11,04
209,Incredible Hotel with amazing staff,"This hotel is amazing! My husband went to Dublin for work and I tagged along, we stayed at the Conrad for 2 nights. The hotel is impeccable! The lobby is very nicely decorated and the rooms are equally well appointed. The bed was so comfortable! There were several chargers for your electronics in the room: at the desk which had US and European outlets and then there were USB ports on either side of the bed. Speaking of the desk, it was so comfortable. Instead of having just a chair and a desk, it had a settee in front of the window and the desk in front of that. It made for a perfect place to sit after a long day out. 

The bathroom was spacious with a nice sized shower with a rain head. The room had a bag for your shoes and if you put your shoes in the bag and hung them on the hotel door by 2am they’d polish them and have them back by 6 or 7am. That was a great touch!

The hotel has a pub restaurant on the lower floor which had good food and a more formal restaurant on the lobby level with really good food as well. 

As great and wonderful as the hotel is, the best part of the hotel is its staff. I worked as a manager in customer service for 25+ years and my company focused on providing excellent customer service. That being said, my customer service expectations are very high. But as high as my expectations are, the staff at the Conrad was able to not only meet my expectations but to exceed them! That is no small feat. I had scheduled a tour to the countryside and the pick up point was about 1.5 miles away. It wasn’t terribly far and I could have walked there with enough time. Instead, I decided to take a taxi and used the My Taxi app. Well for the first time ever, there were no taxis to be had! Since I had already waited for a taxi for several minutes there was no way I could walk, I just didn’t have enough time at that point. At that point I figured I was going to miss my tour. But, to my rescue came Michael Fizpatrick who was working at the front desk that morning. Wonderful Michael, after getting the ok from his manager, took me in his personal car to the spot where the tour was picking me up. What?! Amazing! Talk about going above and beyond the call of duty! This young man is unbelievable and because of him I was able to make my tour. The Dublin Conrad has an incredible asset in Michael.

I will definitely stay at the Conrad again, it is one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. Well done, Dublin Conrad!!",5,2018,11,03
209,Week in Dublin,"Stayed at the Conrad during our week stay in Dublin. Fabulous hotel with excellent service and in a great location to walk around most areas worth visiting.  The hotel concierge (David) was so helpful with booking day trips outside of town and giving us his perspective on what to see. This made our trip so easy and pleasurable. The breakfast buffet was excellent. Overall, just a great hotel in a wonderful location near St. Stephens Green park.  ",5,2018,11,03
209,Great Use for Your Hilton Points at a 5-Star Dublin Hotel in a Great Location,"This was our first stop in Ireland after landing in Dublin, and the hotel was very nice to upgrade us to a suite for our anniversary. The bedroom and bathroom were both very nice and large, the mattress was first rate, and the room had a lot of nice areas to read, work, and relax. The hotel was in an excellent location within walking distance of the shopping district and some great pubs, and the included breakfast was great. 
While our upgraded room (Hilton Gold) was not available upon our arrival, the staff worked hard to clean another suite as quickly as possible and checked us in so we'd be ready to take a post-flight nap after our long flight from the U.S. before hitting Dublin. That extra effort--and the delightful anniversary gift left in our room for our anniversary--made it obvious that this property is far more high-end Conrad than everyday Hilton. Thanks for a nice welcome to Dublin!",5,2018,10,30
209,Outstanding Dublin Hotel,"Wonderful hotel with all of the modern amenities! We would absolutely stay here again. Breakfast is outstanding. Rooms are spacious and clean and all staff accomidating. Overall, great location and hotel ",5,2018,10,30
209,Great hotel in a great location,"Stayed for just the one night this time. It is in a great location. The service from the staff is exceptional.  The bar is comfy and the selection of drinks and snacks are great.  The only thing I miss is how breakfast used to be served to you before the refurbishment.  The room is a little cramped when it is full at breakfast time and numerous guests trying to serve themselves can make it a little chaotic at times.  In saying that the selection for breakfast is great, with gluten free options provided at a separate area.  The only problem was trying to get a member of staffs attention to get the gluten free bread toasted (it arrived to the table only heated) and to order bacon (it is available on the buffet but it is sitting on top of bread to soak up the grease which means it isn't gluten free due to cross contamination from the bread) and scrambled eggs, however the waiter I finally found was very helpful and pleasant.  It may be a more pleasant experience if you could order the hot breakfast and use self-service for cereals, juices, yogurts etc.",5,2018,10,30
209,It felt like we were coming home.,"after 29hrs of flight time our taxi pulled up to the Conrad and I exhaled deeply.  The bellman was right there to get our luggage and the concierge check in was easy.  We went to our room right as our luggage was arriving and our bell man got ice for us and showed us how everything worked. The beds were very comfortable and there was a/c which was welcomed as the temperatures were a little warm. The light blocking drapes worked very well and after a quick nap we were ready to go. We were given a city map and instructions on how to get around.

The location is quite good, a two minute walk to St Stephen's green where we could catch a bus or even the hop on hop off.  It is easy walking distance to Grafton Street shopping and about 15 minutes to Temple Bar area where the pubs are...and it is very noisy! 

Breakfast was fantastic! many choices are available and we were able to try some new Irish things. The serving staff were all wonderful, even on days when they were very busy.  it only took a day for them to know we drank coffee and they automatically brought it to us when we came in...common in USA but not in Ireland.

I highly recommend Conrad and will certainly stay again when we visit Ireland.",5,2018,10,29
209,Great hotel,Really loved this hotel. Great location. The service was exceptional. Great bar/restaurant. They offer delicious complimentary snacks and beverages. Hotel is beautiful. I will definitely stay at hotel again in future,5,2018,10,28
209,Great hotel in Dublin.,"The hotel is conveniently located, within walking distance of shopping, restaurants and pubs. The staff here was so nice and helpful.  The rooms were very nice, and the beds were very comfortable.  Definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2018,10,26
209,Linda Russell,"A beautiful hotel with luxurious rooms. A haven in the middle of a busy city! We were so well looked after and welcomed by all the staff from reception, bar staff, breafast staff the next morning. A very friendly atmosphere throughout the hotel that I haven’t come across before. 
The bar and breakfast room are so lovely to sit in. Breakfast was lovely and the bed so comfortable. A big thank you to everyone who looked after us- we are looking forward to coming back already!",5,2018,10,26
209,"Great location, newly remodeled",Excellent location near St Stephens Green walk to shopping and key sites.  Very comfortable room with excellent concierge staff. Good restaurant attached.  Front staff could be more empathetic and attentive IMO,5,2018,10,24
209,The softest bed I’ve ever experienced ,"Quick one-night stay at this hotel.  5 stars so it was as expected. Private, quiet and very swish rooms.  Breakfast was good and slept like a baby.  Would recommend for its access to the city centre and the luxury. ",5,2018,10,23
209,Pre show dinner ,Had a wonderful dinner before attending the NCH . We opted for the premises theatre menu which for 3 courses was 35e. Good value for the quality. All courses  were delicious and the service was excellent.  Highly recommended ,5,2018,10,22
209,Weekend in Dublin,"Had a great weekend at the Conrad with friends.  The hotel is close enough to the city centre to do all the things you would like to whilst visiting Dublin, and it is a comfortable place.

Great bar on the ground floor and the bar man Shane has a great knowledge of the city and certainly makes  having a drink a fun experience.

Look forward to a return visit ",4,2018,10,19
209,Good snack in Alfie Byrne's Pub. (This review does not cover the hotel itself),"Dropped in here today for a quick cappuccino while on the way to the NCH across the road. The drink was served promptly at my request and was of very good quality with the taste of the coffee coming through clearly as indeed it should. The two young staff members were efficient, courtous and friendly. Well done.",5,2018,10,19
209,Luxurious and excellent staff,"When I checked in I was greeted by a young woman with a huge smile and a warm demeanor.  It wasn't forced in anyway and I immediately felt comfortable.  As a Hilton property I chose it because of my gold status with the HHonors program and they did not disappoint.  I was upgraded to a room on the top floor and the lobby was spotless and every employee was impeccably dressed.  I arrived to my room and was quite happy to find a large space with a king size bed and a welcome scent I couldn't identify it but maybe a subtle type of potpourri, or most likely just the scent of the cleaning supplies.  Either way it was soothing and not sterile in anyway.  The view wasn't spectacular (it was of an office building) but Dublin isn't known like some cities as having an iconic skyline.  As it was my birthday I requested a pint of Guinness upon arrival and within an hour of my check in it was delivered to my room perfectly cold and perfectly poured.  The only problem I had is that the TV wouldn't turn on.  One call to the front desk and within 30 minutes the sent maintenance to the room and they discovered a switch behind the TV had been clicked off.  The maintenance gentleman informed me this happens because housekeeping cleans behind the TV and sometime hit the switch.  It's nice to know that housekeeping has great attention to detail and the room reflected that. The property itself is located a bit of a distance from attractions like Temple Bar and the other tourist destinations of the city but it is right near St. Stephens Green which is an excellent place for an afternoon stroll.  Spent the evening with friends who live in Dublin in the pub on the lower level and they had a phenomenal selection of beers and whiskeys.  I had an early flight back to the states the next morning and decided to take a cab to ensure I got there on time and the front desk ensured that there would be one waiting the next morning and I was not disappointed. I will actively seek to book Conrad resorts when available in the future.",5,2018,10,15
209,Nice Hotel,"Nice hotel. Lobby and lobby bar / restaurant are really nice. Breakfast was amazing - food was really good - as was the variety.  Lot's of options.  Really good.

Bar was nice as well.

I would skip the the pub in the basement - does not really seem to be part of the hotel - although you can charge to your room in it.

Rooms are nice. Not exactly modern - but still nice.

Service was very good. Concierge was very helpful. 

Not cheap - but Dublin hotels seem to be pretty pricey. Not sure I would spend the money there again if I could get something more reasonable at the time.  But at this time - was pretty much the same as other Hilton properties.",5,2018,10,15
209,Long Weekend ,"Great Hotel just off St Stephens park , staff and facilities excellent in all aspects 

Very high up on the list of quality Hotels we have stayed in across Europe , good value for money . Breakfast Buffett style or a la carte at an extra but buffet was sufficient. 

Not noisy at all slept well on all three nights there . 

 ",4,2018,10,15
209,Dublin Trip,"Excellent location, staff goes out of their way to help. Great breakfast, they let us pack breakfast for our day trips when leaving early. Construction noise but not the hotels fault. Can get EURO's at front desk.",5,2018,10,15
209,Fabulous Hotel - Great Location,"Stayed here recently and was very impressed with the hotel, staff and the facilities.
Cost wise it was a little on the high side but it was a last minute break away and served us well. Agree with other reviews as the staff are fantastic - Loved the ground floor pub with craft ales and great food. Walkable distance to Stephens Green. Fully Recommended.",5,2018,10,14
209,Highly Recommend the Conrad,"From check in to checkout we were taken care of. The Staff cannot do enough, the rooms are quiet, and the Breakfast Buffet is one of the best. The beds are so comfortable you will not want to get out of bed in the mornings. Very quiet area but everything is within walking distance.",5,2018,10,08
209,Exceptional Hotel,"I had a fantastic experience while staying at the Conrad Dublin this week. It started even before I arrived when I got an email for their customer service manager asking me if there was anything they could do to make my stay a positive one. When I got there, I had an upgrade to my room as an Hilton member and the room I got was amazing on the 7th floor. Love all the service they provide and the staff was also extremely welcoming. I enjoyed a continental breakfast there as well and it was wonderful. I know where to stay my next time in Dublin. Plus, the location is pretty central to the city, so you are not too far away from all the activities. Fantastic hotel and service. Just fantastic.",5,2018,10,07
209,Exceptional Customer Service ,"This is he second time I have stayed in this location. Customer Service at this hotel is hands down the best I have received. The staff go above and beyond to ensure that their guests are comfortable. The rooms are awesome with more than usual amenities. Restaurant is great too.
Highly recommend this location for those visiting Dublin for business or pleasure.",5,2018,10,03
209,Centrally located,"We stayed at the Dublin Conrad on 9/27/18 and 9/28/18. The hotel is a Hilton Hotel centrally located in Dublin. The room was expensive, quite small, very ordinary. The staff was helpful, particularly directing us to an excellent restaurant for dinner.",3,2018,10,02
209,Warm and Elegant Home Away from Home,"The accommodations and amenities are close to perfect from the moment you arrive, but it’s the PEOPLE throughout the facility and across all shifts that are truly remarkable. 

They care - really care about your stay and experience. They smile and make you feel like you are visiting family from the front desk to the server in the restaurant. 

I wouldn’t stay anywhere else in Dublin.",5,2018,10,02
209,Great time great food,Stayed here with my boyfriend after a concert in the concert hall. Absolutely wonderful location and very stylish hotel with clean and welcoming rooms. We went for a meal pre concert the restaurant was unfortunately too busy but we did not have a reservation so that is fair enough but we ate the lemiels bar and it had lovely food and nice service special mention to Mark in the bar. We got to have breakfast in the restaurant the next day also great service the staff are a credit to the hotel and spend so much time and effort to make you feel welcome. Jodie from the restaurant was so nice and friendly and made our stay memorable. Overall we deffo would stay hhere again.,4,2018,10,01
209,Quiet corner near St Stephen’s Green,"It’s a modern hotel, so the beds were very comfortable, and the bathroom was well equipped. Service was great and concierge was very helpful. Located near St Stephen’s Green, it was convenient to take a short cut towards the shopping and restaurant areas. At least a good 15 minutes walk to Molly Malone’s statue where all tours began.
",4,2018,10,01
209,Great vacation hotel in Dublin.,Perfect location for seeing Dublin and the staff was excellent. We were thrilled with the hotel allowing us to check in when we arrived at 1030 am after a long flight from DFW. It allowed us to acclimate easily. ,5,2018,09,29
209,This hotel was outstanding!,"We stayed at this hotel before flying home to London after a busy weekend at a wedding. 
Check in was amazing and we were made me to feel very welcome. 

Once in the room a porter/waiter came to the room with a plate of small chocolates and a bottle of water, this made me feel extra special. 
I work for Hilton so I am very happy to see such amazing service. I haven't stopped thinking about this hotel since we left, and I would love to return one day. 

Breakfast was amazing too with fresh tea leaves and fresh orange juice, nothing was to much trouble for the staff. 

Thank you all at Conrad Dublin, we were made to feel very very welcome.",5,2018,09,29
209,My Stay,"The staff are just amazing. The location is perfect. Walking distance to pubs, shopping and food. The rooms are beautiful and spacious. The breakfast is worth it. The On-site pub has a great variety. I loved that the staff checked in on me throughout the trip.",5,2018,09,27
209,Afternoon drinks,We had a lovely drink here Emily served us and she was friendly approachable and very helpful we were going to the airport so had to leave but would love a return visit.  It is also very handy for the National Concert Hall.,5,2018,09,26
209,Very Nice Hotel in a Great Location,"Located within easy walking distance of the Temple district, Trinity College and other sites. The rooms are quiet with extremely comfortable beds to sleep off jet lag. Very helpful staff when asking for directions and food recommendations.",4,2018,09,24
209,Very Nice Hotel,"This stay is provided by our tour group Tauck. So we know it will be of high quality and value. This hotel is located by Stephens Green and within walking distance to shopping and the Temple bar area. The rooms are a nice size with a refrigerator, coffee machine and a safe for valuables. The bathroom is a comfortable size with a tub/shower combination. There are several restaurants in the hotel from a bar/grill to more upscale. Staff is friendly and accommodating. ",5,2018,09,19
209,Quick access and booking with great customer service and assistance,"Got our flight canceled last minute, was able to book two rooms at the Conrad through the Hilton App on my phone.  When we arrived they were super cordial even though we had looked like we had been through the ringer and definitely not dressed for such a nice place.  They helped us with dinner reservations and a taxi for the following morning at the time of our check in and had no problem with splittng the bill between the four travelers so we could bill the airline. ",5,2018,09,19
209,Lovely stay in Dublin,"The Conrad Dublin is a wonderful hotel, and the staff are all great.  We arrived from the west coast of Canada early in the morning (about 10 a.m.) and fully expected to stow our luggage and be sent off for awhile.  Well, they had a room ready for us and we were able to shower and have a nap after a very long flight.  The front staff were friendly and helpful, the staff in the breakfast room were great.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.  The location is very good, walkable to many things.",5,2018,09,18
209,My stay in Conrad Dublin,"The Conrad Dublin is located quiet and good place of the city. Staffs were kind and informal to me, except restraint's staffs. They were not to be said professional and not knowledgeable about wine and cushiness. My hotel room was satisfactory clean. However the desk and lighting system is not enough for a business trip. Internet was good.",4,2018,09,16
209,Five stars all around,"It is the employees and their attitudes that set a hotel apart from the rest. This was the case at the Conrad, the employees made a real difference. Everyone, front desk staff, concierge, doorman, bellhops, housekeeping and restaurant staff, we came in contact with throughout our short stay were friendly, efficient and went out of their way to be helpful. A special thanks to Maria in the breakfast restaurant for all her travel advice for the west coast of Ireland.
The location is perfect for exploring Dublin, either by foot or by bus and an extra plus was that the airport coach stops literally in front to the hotel.
Our room was bright, clean and quite spacious for European standards.",5,2018,09,16
209,Perfect from Start to Finish ,"My husband and I brought my father-in-law and my mom for a family trip to Dublin and Edinburgh. 

I’m so glad we chose this property for the Dublin part of our trip. 

They know what they’re doing at this hotel. They communicated with our family before the stay and made pre-trip arrangements seamlessly, they anticipated our arrival and greeted us warmly with a glass of champagne. 

Check in was a breeze. Our luggage was lost by the airline for 3 full days after arrival. Liam (Guest Relations Manager and an absolute rockstar with a very bright future in hospitality) sent up the essentials (and then some) so we didn’t feel completely gross without our things. It made all the difference. 

Liam also arranged and personally guided us on a walking tour of Dublin. He is fantastic. We learned an Irishman’s view of the city rather than a boilerplate tourist tutorial and it was great fun. It even ended with a pint at Temple Bar. We got our parents a bit tipsy... that was great fun... they loved hanging out with Liam! 

The rooms were impeccably maintained. No signs of wear and tear. Housekeeping was brilliant. They knew when we were gone and never knocked when we were there. Not for daily service or for turndown. This was one of many things I really appreciated during our stay. Our three rooms were perfectly clean when we got back every day, always. 

The concierge desk was all over anything we needed. Reservations for dinner, changes to our itinerary, booking a day trip to the Cliffs of Moher. They even took an active role in getting our lost bags to us. Their commitment to communication as a team was really impressive. We got the general sense that the entire team knew what we needed and addressed those needs without hesitation. 

Breakfast was fantastic. Lots of options. Eggs cooked to order. Super quality. Nice atmosphere at the restaurant. It was really nice way to start every day with a leisurely breakfast in the restaurant. The lobby bar is also a great place to have a drink before dinner. 

I just loved this hotel. The location is wonderful, the atmosphere is simple but beautiful and the people really make it great. Shout out to Liam for being the best host ever. 

We will be back on our next trip to beautiful Dublin. I have nothing negative to say whatsoever about this experience. It was pretty perfect.

209,Construction site noise,"We stayed for one night to attend a concert. Our view from the room was a construction site. We understand we cannot halt progress and the view was tolerable. What surprised us, and was not tolerable was the construction site noise, filling skips, reversing trucks etc. on a Saturday morning, starting at 7am.
When we booked the room and the room was allocated, the hotel should have had the courtesy to alert us to the fact the construction starts at 7am on a Saturday morning. It was not acceptable. When we complained, we got an apology, but the professional process would be to alert guests to the construction noise when rooms are allocated.",2,2018,09,15
209,"Conrad Dublin puts the ""rad"" in Conrad","I don't normally write a social media review of a hotel property, but I must make an exception in this particular case. From the first moment I spoke with Harry Glynn in Sales, and Louise in Reservations, I was made to feel welcome like an old friend - and this, before I actually arrived.

This Conrad is arguably the ""jewel in the Conrad crown"" - every member of the staff made my team and I feel incredibly welcome.

I stayed 14 nights, graciously upgraded to a Conrad Suite. From Housekeeping to room service, Concierge to doormen, without exception, the ""Irish Spirit"" is evident 24 hours per day.

On behalf of my entire team, and myself, we look forward to our return in October, and to a mutually rewarding, and long lasting relationship with Conrad Dublin.

I am pleased to highly recommend Conrad Dublin as THE only place to stay, whether it's a business trip or a personal trip.

See you again in October!!",5,2018,09,15
209,Excellent Hotel,"I booked my sister at a boutique hotel which had 4.5 star rating. It turned out to be so awful that at the last minute I was scouting around for hotels. Conrad rose to the occasion. I was in Kilkenny attending a meeting.

The customer service was excellent and not only did they arranged for someone to pick my sister from this boutique hotel to the Conrad. 

Initially I had some difficulty trying to communicate with the reception. He was not impressive at all. 

However thereafter it was amazing. The rooms were large. One of the staff Tony Neary from the Conceirge was superb. He was very helpful and deserve our mention. He made my sister’s stay a memorable one. For me it gave me a sense of relief that there was someone nice looking after the guests.

We will never forget Conrad Dublin for accommodating our last minute request when all others were not able to do so and for making my sister feel so welcomed",5,2018,09,15
209,Nice hotel in good locatin,"Over night stay for early flight. 30 mins from the airport.  Nice hotel room with very comfortable bed.  Standalone desk for working which I liked with plenty of power options with usb charging.  New larger flat screen Samsung TV. Nespresso pods which is an added benefit.  Had a Ruben sandwich with chips via room service which was very good. Good service to a level you would expect from a 5 star hotel.
Location is also handy if you want to explore Dublin. ",4,2018,09,15
209,Great hotel in excellent location,"We stayed here for a weekend away and we were really impressed with how nice this hotel is. Rooms are clean, modern and spacious and the beds are extremely comfortable. Hotel restaurant is nice, food is good quality and service was great. We had room service also for our desserts as my daughter was tired and those were excited. Bar drinks are a little expensive for cocktails but they were very nice and probably not any different to any other 5 star hotel in Dublin. Location is good for walking to central locations for shopping, the city tour bus, next to a great park so would recommend the location. Nice bars and restaurants within walking distance also.",5,2018,09,13
209,Good location with lots of good restaurants nearby,"We arrived from the states weary and way early for check-in. The doormen were friendly and offered to store our bags. I had pre-selected a room on on the 6th floor, but the lady at check-in said that because I was a Diamond member, she was upgrading me to the 7th floor. Either way neither room was ready. They suggested we go get a bite to eat and would text us when the room was ready.

The Concierge suggested Hatch and Sons on the other side of St. Stephen's Green.It was FANTASTIC! We had the baked eggs with sausage and bacon on top and soda bread (that's a different review, but I highly recommend).

As we explored other nearby areas about two hours later, I received notification from the hotel that our room was ready. We made our way back and settled into our room. I don't recall the number but it was a higher number and it was odd (I think 743). As you face the hotel, the odd numbered rooms are on the right and the even numbered rooms are on the left. A quick check out the window revealed active construction in the courtyard below. We could occasionally hear a little something, but it wasn't too bad. 

This is going to sound crazy, but the disruptive noise while trying to rest came from two seagulls (who I suspect were mating) on the ledge directly outside our window. For thirty minutes they were chasing each other around and one was screeching constantly (pic attached). The hotel should put plastic owls up around the ledge to keep them away.

Toward the back of the hotel where the lowered numbered rooms are, there is construction across the street where they are pounding something into the ground and they start early. 

We were out of the room during the day, so the noise from construction wasn't really an issue. They third night we were awakened by the outside bar deck that is directly under the odd numbered rooms that would effect from about #25 up on all floors. The crowd was yelling and laughing loudly waking us a little before midnight.

My recommendation on room selection would be on the even numbered rooms on the higher #s like #22 and up on the higher floors.

The staff I found to be top notch; the doormen, the concierge and the dining staff. Each morning for breakfast we were seated quickly and promptly presented with pressed coffee upon request. We ordered from the menu three mornings and received our meal made to order within 10-12 minutes.

The second day I received a text to see how our stay was going (nice touch!) I actually used this feature the last day to ask the hotel to cancel our dinner reservations as we were on a guided tour out of the city that was getting back an hour later than stated. I didn't want to incur an international fee for the call, so I texted the hotel. They cancelled and sent me a text confirming they had done so.",4,2018,09,13
209,Not great!,"I travel alot and this hotel clearly has a problem with staff & attitudes. They  don’t care about their guests- unless you’re a business traveler and look the part. 

Im a solo female traveler on a 2 day lay over Dublin. Tried staying at one of the good hotels in the area like the Marrion or Shelbourn but they were over book due to a large wedding party.

Hilton isn’t my favorite but it was in a good location next to Stephens Creek park. The rooms are a good size; beds are comfortable and they do have a nice gym. 

My problem was with the staff... for one getting directions from these ppl was absolute joke...

I asked if there was a market in the area so I could pick up some drinks & snacks to keep in the room. Doorman said ‘ooh there’s one pretty far away... at least a 10 min walk.’ Ohboy! Im a marathon runner & i look like it so I managed! Of course they could give me any recommendations like M&s hall which just on the other side of the park! 

Next morning I asked where to catch the train to go to Royal Hospital & they lied and said: no trains go there - must take a cab. So i pulled out my phone and showed them the trains (that didn’t go there!). 

Sadly, i got more help from the strangers on the street than I did there.

Next morning complete disaster- i made the mistake of prepaying for buffett breakfast which was horrible. The staff were so rude to me, want to seat me & other travelers alone outside the restaurant, giving priority to business travelers and good looking asians. Are you kidding me??

I’ve never heard of a hotel restaurant having a certain ascetic to eating breakfast at the main restaurant instead of the bar area. 

May I remind you the restaurant/bar/lobby were dead & night. Travelers aren’t rushing over to eat at the Conrad with a line out the door like Shelbourn No9; which was packed every night!

I sat alone at breafast for over 20 mins watching the staff pass my table a half a dozen times without any acknowledgement. I had flag someone down for a menu; beg for coffee and then wait another 30mins for my breakfast to arrive!

The buffet wasn’t very good at all: same stale pastries, breads, cereals and muffins. They pork sausages/bacon tasted like they were heated & refrigerated a number of times.

Salmon/cold cuts gross!!

Next morning same thing.... fought to sit inside the restaurant instead of the bar area again. And it was empty at 7am! It was always empty.

I complained to booth the manager of the restaurant & hotel but they didn’t care. They treated me a stupid little girl that didn’t matter.

My advice: skip the buffet and get yourself a real Irish breakfast near by. There are a ton of great places in the area that are a lot more lively.

We found a great breakfast at Temple bar: The BOXTY house!! TB is a little too touristy for me but they do have some good restaurants in the area.

Had scrambled eggs with real Irish Soda bread and fresh pork sausages (which my friend enjoyed!) we also ordered the patatoes - amazing!

As a default i recommend M&s food hall: they’re not only nice but they have a great selection of sandwiches, snacks and fresh baked goods to enjoy.

We ventured around the city on foot; which is the best way to see a city in my opinion. We walked to all of the tourist sights.... the irish are so warm and welcoming and helpful (unlike the hotel!) they actually approach you & offer their-assistance.

209,Lovely stay,Hotel staff is very nice and accommodating. Updated rooms and great aromatherapy throughout the hotel. Breakfast is lovely and healthy with lots of options. Good location near St Stephan’s green and Graphton st. Only downfall is bed is a bit hard,5,2018,09,11
209,1 night stay before travelling home to London,"Beautiful decor very elegant and comfortable. Room was very nice with the most comfortable bed ever, did not want to get up. Everything  that was needed was in the room, ironing board, hair dryer, bath robes etc.  Food in the restaurant was very varied and delicious. Enjoyed a drink in the very relaxing bar.  Most of all Mr. Hegarty and his staff were friendly, helpful and attentive as were all other members of staff that we met. Thank you, can't wait to go back. Well done.",5,2018,09,11
209,Didn't live up,"While I enjoyed my stay at your hotel, as a Hilton Honors member, there are some elements of the experience that were not up to the usual standards and I wanted to comment on and/or alert you to:Our room:On arrival, the AC was not working and the right hand window doesn’t close all the way (which was particularly relevant because of the item below).My room was picked by the Hilton website.  The room it  picked it was right on top of the active construction site, with significant noise every day 7am often to 6pm, Wednesday through Saturday.  Had I know, I would have selected a room on the other side of the hotel.   B’fastYour breakfast room is confusing, congested and the cooking (poached eggs in particular) is not good.You use huge plates and have small tables so wait staff have to make more trips to clear and that causes more chaos.  And the timing of food delivery is off – 15 minutes for porridge but toast comes (burnt) 10 minutes before the eggs.  .",3,2018,09,10
209,Great hotel in a great City," Our hotel was in a quiet part of town but within walking distance of all major attractions. The hotel was modern and well-equipped and the service was excellent and very friendly and welcoming. Staying at a good quality hotel during our trip did have an impact on how enjoyable the whole trip was. Breakfast buffet was also very good and there was a great selection of different foods available to eat. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and would stay here again.",5,2018,09,10
209,Great location. Great hotel,"This is one of the better hotels in Dublin. The rooms are great and beds really comfortable. Staff are great and really helpful. The breakfast, although a bit expensive, is fully of great Irish food.

209,Lovely Dublin hotel,"We had a lovely stay at the Conrad hotel. Right across the street from the concert hall, convenient to St. Stephen's green park, and walkable to shopping and tourist attractions. Staff was excellent and friendly and the hotel room was very comfortable. ",5,2018,09,02
209,"Gorgeous restaurants, decent rooms","Each of the restaurants and bars were really beautiful with solid food & drinks. Coburg Brasserie is a terrific spot to grab a drink. Lemuel's is really goregous with a very nice breakfast buffet and surprisngly affordable for dinner. Alfie Byrne's is fun for craft beers.

Rooms felt a tad tired, but were clean and functional.

Would be nice if they'd let you put 2 adults/2 kids in a room. I know this is so difficult in Europe but they've got rooms with 2 queen beds. Seems like they could accomodate families readily with these.",4,2018,08,31
209,Excellent stay in Dublin,"I cant' say enough good things about this lovely hotel. It's a Hilton property but feels very high end, from the lobby to the restaurant to the rooms to the service. It's a bit on the expensive side but really worth it in terms of what it offers. I loved the location, just a couple blocks from beautiful St. Stephen's Green and a few blocks more to Grafton Street and Temple Bar. The room was beautifully appointed and offered a lovely turn down service. Breakfast options were ample and delicious. The staff couldn't have been more helpful. Highly recommend.",5,2018,08,31
209,Overnight stay ,"Was staying for one night back in May, such a gorgeous hotel with perfect location. Breakfast was delicious. Counting the days till I’m back on October with my partner. No issues with this hotel so totally recommend it! ",5,2018,08,29
209,Very pleasant stay,"Very pleasant modern but stylish hotel. Nice rooms, great beds and epic breakfasts. Also very nice and helpful staff. Location is a fraction out of the very centre but that’s actually a good thing. 

Right now there is an active building site on one side of the hotel. Make sure you ask for a room away from that side. We got woken up at 6.45 by a lot of clanging and banging. Luckily there was a room on the quiet side we could move to. Apart from that, all was good.",5,2018,08,28
209,Avoid this hotel,"Overpriced for the service & location, which is a bit distant for tourist sightseeing. The service feels like there’s no one in charge. Well meaning kids doing their best. Example: leak in the ceiling; plumber(good fellow, service oriented, they cd use a few more like him) comes, it’s fixed for awhile. Happens again. Call for assistance but the front desk calls back to say maintenance has left for the day. No one comes up with a bucket or anything so we move stuff out of the way, use our towels. The next day we call down again, plumber comes back, can’t fix it. We need to change rooms. No apologies from the manager or anyone, just a kid who helps with the bags. For 600 euros a night, & 2 days of water dripping into the room, I think they cd have at least said sorry for the inconvenience or the waste of our time. Don’t stay here. You have better choices for the money, for sure.",2,2018,08,28
209,Andy,The hotel is beautiful.  The staff was outstanding.  The breakfast is average.  The rooms are modern. With AC. Some hotel don't have AC. It is within walking distance to trinity college and shopping. The park is a half block away.,5,2018,08,27
209,Nice hotel in good location,The Conrad is a very nice business style hotel.  Rooms are very nice with nice bathrooms.  Restaurants are good with great service. Well located in central Dublin. We parked our car in the garage and walked mostly.,4,2018,08,27
209,Excellent afternoon tea,"Nice and tasty afternoon tea, good selection of tea(at least 15 choice of tea) and sweet treats. Friendly service from Nicoleta, she is professional and knowledgeable. Really Enjoyed my two hours stay here. Recommended.",5,2018,08,27
209,Five Star Service,"I immensely enjoyed my stay at the Conrad Dublin.  The rooms were clean, comfortable, well appointed and modern.  They feature luxury bath products, a large shower and tub, and great connections near the bed and in the desk for electronics.  The location was ideal because it's in a quieter section of town, but super accessible to the main streets by walking or taking the trams.  There is also a bus stop in front of the hotel from the airport.  Just take the Airlink 757 and get off at the Earlsfort Terrace stop.  I purchased a roundtrip ticket and this was so easy and cheap.  No need for a taxi here.  Breakfast was amazing too. Anything you can think of they have, even freshly brewed coffee right at your table! 

The best part of my stay was the service.  All staff represent the very best of the Hilton and Conrad brand.  From my pre-arrival e-mail, check-in, conversation with bell staff and the lounge staff, each interaction was friendly and sincere.  They truly want to make sure that you will have a good stay.  Special mention to Mark, Emily and Shane in the lounge because they provided great conversation, service, and recommendations for our other travels in Ireland.  Thank you!",5,2018,08,24
209,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed here for one night with my wife to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary. Hotel upgraded us to better room on the top floor. Room was lovely, clean and comfortable, (although I'm not a big fan of those pillows you sink into!) They gave us a complimentary bottle of wine and a nice chocolate display for our anniversary. 
Great location, close to St. Stephen's Green and about a 10 min walk to Grafton St.",5,2018,08,24
209,Not Conrad-Class....,"This is a well-located, recently-renovated hotel with a manager and staff that tries hard.  However, the hotel’s redesign and somewhat inconsistent service, left me slightly disappointed. 

I have stayed at some lovely Conrad properties, and I have always found them underrated.  They feature world-class service, design and amenities that compete favorably with some of the world’s best.  This Conrad did not fall in line with those expectations. 

My interaction started with an email to the manager requesting more information on the offered shuttle service from the airport, which is advertised on their website.  I got a very quick reply, and was told the concierge would be in touch with the cost.  I never heard back from the concierge.  

When I mentioned it in a subsequent email I received a quick apology, and a promise that they would look into why I hadn’t been contacted.  I was also informed that we would be able check in early, which was very much appreciated as we were landing at 5:30am.  I was hardly concerned about the lack of communication from the concierge as the early check-in was far more valuable to me, and a very generous and thoughtful way to apologize.  There is obviously a thoughtful and intelligent manager here.  

When we checked in, I think we were also given a room upgrade.  Not a suite or anything, just a nicer room on a higher floor.  Again, very appreciated.  

The room was small but very lovely.  Our view was of a seagull-filled roof, but all in all a very attractive room.  The bed was very comfortable with lots of top-notch linens and great pillows.  

However....and this is my big new pet-peeve with newly designed hotel rooms....THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO DRAWERS TO PUT FOLDED CLOTHES IN.  This is a ridiculous new hotel design trend, that I am single-handedly committed to ending.  I book nice hotel rooms and I want them to look nice while I am in them.  I want to be able to put everything away somewhere.  It relaxes me.  I do not want to pay $400 a night to live out of my suitcase.  Hotel rooms need, either a proper clothes dresser or large drawers in the wardrobe.  This room had neither and it is really annoying.  Note to hotel owners - I will no longer book a hotel room that does not have drawers.  The last three redesigned hotel rooms I have checked into had no clothes drawers.  If cruise lines can manage to fit drawers into 250 sq ft rooms then so can you major hoteliers.

Ok....enough....

The bathroom was large and fairly well-appointed.  Unfortunately, they use an inadequate, half-wall of glass to keep the shower from spraying into the bathroom.  I know, I know this is the way Europeans do it....but I often book American chains because I expect they anticipate what Americans like when they travel and will appoint their rooms for their audience.  Not in this case.

Lastly, and again I know Europeans don’t use a/c the way we do and don’t need the rooms as cold, but again - I’m American and I do.  I was never able to get the room to a comfortable temperature.  I asked the front desk for a fan, which they quickly provided, although they never asked why I needed it...so I expect this may be a regular problem.  

Later I asked the front desk if they could have a technician come up and see if they could get it any cooler.  They said they would, but there was never any follow-up, and the room never really got any more comfortable.  Luckily we had the fan, which did make it comfortable enough. But do you really want to pay $400+ a night for hotel room that is only comfortable with a table fan blowing on you all night?  

Breakfast in the well-designed dining room was lovely each morning.  All of the staff were very genuine and accommodating.  The selection of food was very good and well-presented.  

I am slightly reluctant to write too negative a review.  The manager went out of his way several times to make our stay more comfortable, which is very appreciated.  And my two big issues with this stay were very particular to me and what makes me a comfortable and happy guest.  But this is what great hotels are supposed to do well - create an environment where just about every one of their guests can be comfortable.  

Rooms have thermostats so that guests can choose the temperature that’s most comfortable for them.  If the system is incapable of getting to my cooler - but not unreasonable - temperature, that’s inadequate.  If many guests choose to live out of their suitcases - bully for them - but provide dressers for those that do not.  That’s world-class.  

Probably a lovely hotel for most people, but just average for this somewhat-curmudgeonly guest.

209,"Excellent stay, no complaints","A lovely hotel with attentive, friendly, and helpful staff. Rooms were clean, comfortable, and spacious. We partook of the breakfasts which were quite tasty. 

Okay, one complaint that is apparently limited to one room. Beware if you get room 729! There's a flat area outside the window that the seagulls like to congregate on. Nature! Cool! Until between 4 and 6 in the morning when they start up their calling and chattering. 3 straight nights of early-morning seagull alarms did not result in restful sleep.",5,2018,08,22

I can recommend this property without reservation.",5,2018,08,20
209,Staff Great ! dont use the iron,The hotel is lovely very updated and clean. We stated and had a gala event I went to iron my shirt an the iron sprayed rust all over my white shirt I had 20 mins and the staff was great the young man at the desk ran to try and buy me a shirt. House keeping came up and tried to bring cleaners. They were very eager to help ( in the end my wife's two tide stick got enough out ! ,4,2018,08,17
209,Enjoyed our stay,"We had a good 2 night stay at this hotel. My Mom and I were travelling for pleasure and picked this hotel as I’d stayed there a few years before and liked the hotel and the location. 

We had a room with twin beds and they were comfortable with nice bedding, good down pillows.  We had a lovely bathroom with a soaker tub/shower combination and the bathroom amenities were also nice.

We hadn’t realized that breakfast was included in our room rate, so that was a pleasant surprise. The buffet was plentiful with cereals, porridge, fruit, breads, pastries, meats, cheeses, juices and you could also order off the menu as part of the complimentary breakfast. Yummy and this set us up for the day!!

Staff were friendly and helpful.  St Stephen’s Green was right nearby and we enjoyed hanging out there or cutting through the park to get to other parts of the city like Grafton St.  One of the hop on hop off bus stops was near the hotel, at the Green.

Our room itself was quiet with respect to our neighbours but not so quiet with road construction being done outside til 9:30 pm one night, 11 pm one night.

The only reason I gave the hotel 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the road noise which of course, they couldn’t control but could have warned us about, and because they didn’t acknowledge my Mom’s birthday, like every other hotel so far has done.  Very little things in the big scheme of things!

We would stay here again.",4,2018,08,16
209,"Good Location, but Average Room and Loud Construction","I'm a Hilton Honors member and always try to stay at a Hilton if possible. I used all of my points to stay at the Conrad Dublin for one night and I was disappointed that I used my points on this. 

Our room was decorated nicely, but it was pretty small and overlooked a building that was undergoing construction. They didn't tell us this as we were checking in and since it was our first night in Ireland we were jetlagged and longing for a good night's sleep. That was not possible as construction started before 7 a.m. Saturday morning. Not to mention the insanely loud seagulls that fly around the area making noise at all hours of the night.

The concierge and staff were all very helpful and nice and I did mention this feedback to them after check out. Bummed it was a subpar experience since I heard so many great things about this property and how luxurious it is.",3,2018,08,14
209,Good Brand doing what it is supposed to do.,"Handsome clean lines in Lobby.  Breakfast well done with service. Eggs iced anyway you want them, and nice staples at the buffet.  No waiting for table.  Free for Diamond.  A lesser plan for Gold.  Gold comes with the AMEX Platinum card.

Competent concierge and desk staff.  You don't wait for service, and you don't generally have to even ask for him, you are gently offered it on line before getting there, and in person in lobby and elevators.

Rooms are clean.  towels are adequate.  Anything you ask for is sent up.  Large bathroom for Europe with large tub.

Conrad Hilton is simply a well run hotel where you are greeted professionally, and taken care of.

The hotel is well located by good food, and shopping and close to theatre area... and a large beautiful park.",5,2018,08,13
209,Nice Hotel in a good location,"We stayed 3 nights here in mid July. The room was large and comfortable. The bathroom was large and had a walk in shower and separate bathtub. Good room amenities, ironing board etc. We had dinner in the Coburg Brasserie 2 nights that were excellent. Fish and Chips, Shrimp and Linguine and  Lobster Mac and Cheese. The breakfast buffet was only average at best with slow service from the kitchen. The eggs and toast along with the beacon usually arrived under or over cooked. The coffee comes in a French Press which I've never liked but they did bring me Cappuccino instead. I didn't see any nice restaurants or Pubs near the Hotel, just mostly office and apartment buildings. There is a beautiful park a few blocks away and at the far corner of that park it opens up to a mall/street shops area. We liked the hotel but it did not feel like 5 stars, more like 4 stars but still very good. Sorry but It seems over priced for what it is.",5,2018,08,13

209,Very helpful and terrific staff as well as a stellar hotel,Stayed at this hotel for one week and our stay was perfect from start to finish.  When my wife was not feeling all that well we stayed in and used their restaurant and it is of the excellent Hilton quality you expect from one of their properties. Free wifi comes with the room if you order the room online and are a Hilton member.  You are close enough to the city and can use the light rail system that is literally one block away.  If you use that it takes you to all the attractions in Dublin within walking distance for only 7.50 euros a day for unlimited use per person.  It was a nice place to take a vacation.,5,2018,08,09
209,Lovely ,"I highly recommend this hotel. We stayed one night on our way back from Kenmare to be closer to the airport. The room itself is very nice , USA outlets near the bed for phone , extremely comfortable bed, and very clean. The restaurant was very nice , we had both lunch and dinner there, and it was delicious and the staff very professional and courteous. ",5,2018,08,09
209,A terrific guest experience from start to finish,"We stayed here in August 2018 and can’t wait to schedule another visit. The guest room was luxurious with a beautiful view of the city. Our room was spotless and our bed was so comfortable, we had to force ourselves out of bed each day. The breakfast was delicious with plenty of options. The front desk staff was very welcoming and helpful. Great location too!",5,2018,08,07
209,A must stay!,"Amazing staff, very clean hotel, great food, and great location! The staff is friendly and willing to help with everything. The food was fresh and served hot. The rooms and amenities are very clean. The hotel is in the perfect location to walk everywhere you need to go in Dublin. ",5,2018,08,07
209,Luxury accommodations and great staff,"We were upgraded to the Presidential Suite for our stay at the Conrad Dublin, and it was amazing! It is bigger than most 2bedroom apartments! We do not know why we were so lucky, but it was great. The staff here is very helpful and efficient. The rooms are really lovely. The toiletries are high end. This hotel is located within walking distance to the Book of Kells and Stephen’s Green so it is a very walkable location. The National Concert Hall is right across the street. If we are ever in Dublin again, we will definitely stay here.",5,2018,08,02
209,Great Staff,"This is a first class hotel with a great location. The staff was very helpful during my entire stay, I had a foot injury and then the excellence of the staff  came into play. They were able to get a doctor to the hotel for me within a hour on a Sunday afternoon. We had breakfast and dinner there and both were very good. The room and facilities are modern and well maintained. We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,07,30
209,Great stay!,"Five days stay for business. All staff (from front desk, to restaurant, to cleaning) were great - very friendly and helpful. Big clean room with all the amenities, big comfortable bed. Breakfast was great - good selection from the buffet and menu (do try the banana bread french toast!). 
Will come back for sure.",5,2018,07,30
209,Absolutely Will Stay Here Again,"We were initially staying at a hotel in Parnell Square.  After one night we checked out early (losing our money we prepaid there) and checked into the Conrad Dublin.  We should have done that from the start instead of trying to ""save money"" on the other hotel which was terrible.  Although there was a problem with our room initially - the AC was leaking water in the room - they ended up moving us (we got upgraded) to another room.  I'm not sure why we didn't get the upgrade initially if it was available, since we are both gold members and booked directly, but eh, whatever.  We were happy that they took care of the situation immediately.  There were NO other issues during our stay.  The hotel was in a great location.  It was nice and very clean, although they were undergoing some renovations in the lobby at the time (June 2016), but nothing that disturbed us when in our room.  We did enjoy some tea and coffee (at no cost) in the restaurant while we were waiting for our room to be ready upon check-in. I'm happy to say that had some non-dairy milk available as well (soy), which was great for me being vegan.  Another morning we did have breakfast in the restaurant and we also ordered room service during out stay, in which I was able to order a vegan pizza (no cheese, with veggies and arugula).  Overall we LOVED our stay here and would absolutely recommend this hotel as well as stay here again the next time we are in Dublin.  Really appreciated the vegan options they did have here.",5,2018,07,29
209,Hilton Conrad Hotel,Great hotel in Edinburgh. Great bar with a very nice restaurant. The full Irish breakfast is very good. Accommodations are superb and the staff is well trained. About 30 minutes from the airport in a nice part of town.,5,2018,07,28
209,Marvelous stay!,"My husband and I stayed here 3 nights in June while on vacation in Ireland.  The hotel was immaculately clean, as was our room.  The hotel is located in a more quiet area of Dublin, but is in easy walking distance to major sites and bus tours as well as shopping.  The room was spacious, well appointed and comfortable. 

Our check in experience was friendly, warm, and efficient and they even had our room ready well before check in time, which was very much appreciated after the long flight.  The room was kept very clean and housekeeping did a very thorough job.  We never received turn-down, but it might not be included here?  

Our first night we ate a light dinner with fabulous cocktails at Lemuel's Bar.  The service was good and the food was light and tasty.  Breakfast each morning in the Coburg Brasserie was the highlight of our Conrad stay!  They offered a wonderful, comprehensive selection of breakfast fare and everything was fresh and absolutely delicious.  Service at breakfast was wonderful and we always started our day out on a positive note there.  We're Gold honors members, so breakfast was complimentary, but it would be well worth paying for if it weren't.  Our final night there we ate dinner and had drinks at Alfie Byrne's.  While it was the most average of the food we ate, the server/bartender was outstanding.  He was friendly, personable and made excellent recommendations.  We really enjoyed the drinks.  

Overall, I would highly recommend the Conrad in Dublin.",5,2018,07,26
209,Second Stay - Will Return,I love this hotel. The staff is great.  Our room was overlooking a construction site which worried me but it really wasn't too noisy.  We took the AirCoach from Dublin Airport. It drops off right around the corner from the hotel and saves a few euros over taking a cab.  Do yourself a favor and wake up in time for the breakfast.,5,2018,07,23
209,Wonderful,"I didn’t like the idea of staying at this hotel as I usually stay at the Shelbourne, the Merrion or a quaint B&B. For some reason I thought it would be generic and forgettable. I was quickly proven wrong.

The service here is of the highest standard without seeming superior or haughty anc every request was met with a genuine cheerfulness and eagerness to please. Dinner in the restaurant was sensational and breakfast was high quality and exceeded expectations.

We were traveling with a baby and almost every member of staff came over to greet her at one point or another.  The person delivering her crib to the room took it upon herself to bring more towels and toiletries too even though we had just checked in. 

Our room was exceedingly comfortable and the bathroom was lovely. Honestly as long as the price isn’t crazy I’d happily stay here over the Shelbourne or Merrion any day as the service is so personable and warm (special shout out to Jack at the front desk for being extra knowledgeable and helpful). Highly recommend.",5,2018,07,23
209,A relaxing afternoon tea experience with superb service,"My friend and I came in for tea, and it was everything we could have hoped for and more. When there was a little mixup with the reservation, the staff went above and beyond the call of duty in resolving the situation quickly. The tea sandwiches, unique sweet treats and choice of teas provided great and tasty variety. The quiet lounge was the perfect place to catch up with my friend. Most of all, Nicoleta, our server, was super attentive to our needs in the kindest way. I wouldn't hesitate to send my girlfriends here for a calm and relaxing tea experience.",5,2018,07,23
209,Lovely location,"The Conrad is a lovely location for exploring Dublin. Close to the amazing St. Stephen's Green, close to the major shopping Grafton Street, close to Trinity College and a lovely walk cross town to the Guinness Storehouse, I highly recommend it. Their breakfasts are fresh and delicious, and the staff is wonderful.",4,2018,07,22
209,Lovely Hotel,Great hotel in a fantastic location that is right next to all of the important places to see.  Just off St Steven's Park in the centre of Dublin.  Lovely room and excellent service and very close to where all of the airport and hop on hop off buses work from.,4,2018,07,22
209,Very comfortable,"Had a very pleasant 2 night stay here. Well located, close to St Stephens Green and the city centre, pleasant and professional staff. Good size and comfortable bedroom. Good quality breakfast selection. Recommended",5,2018,07,17
209,Such a lovely stay,"Fantastic location, very plush bar and restaurant, helpful staff, such a comfy bed, staff dressed very well...the list goes on! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The only constructive comment I would make is that it was frustrating to have to pay for wifi when we had spent so much on the stay and most bars in Dublin offer it FOC.

Thank you so much for a wonderful birthday break and how welcome you made us feel.",5,2018,07,17
209,Great Stay,"Everything was as expected, that is why we chose the Dublin Conrad. The staff was 5 star.  The concierge(s) at the front desk made our travels outside of the hotel easy  with their expert knowledge.  7th floor Room was great.",5,2018,07,16
209,Outstanding place in Dublin ,"This was a great place to stay: beautiful rooms with all the amenities! The entire staff made us feel welcome. They were all so warm and accommodating!

Breakfast was excellent with a great variety!

Definitely will stay here again next time we are inDublin.
",5,2018,07,15
209,Afternoon Tea-Best in Dublin,"Recently visited the hotel for Afternoon tea with a friend in celebration of her birthday. I have attended lots of different hotels and restaurants for tea but The Conrad do it in style. It's not pretentious so everyone feels welcome and comfortable. Lovely contemporary music playing in the background and a relaxed atmosphere. The tea itself was fabulous, lovely selection all plated freshly.The macaroons were to die for! What stands out most in The Conrad however were the staff. We were served by a beautiful girl called Nicoletta who was warm, friendly and generally just a pleasure to converse with.She even decorated a plate with chocolates for my friend's Birthday. You cannot buy service like this. I've stayed in the Conrad before and again, only wonderful service and a warm welcome greets you. To the GM.. I hope you can thank your lovely staff for our experience. You must be very proud of your hotel and the staff that make it what it is. Class personified.",5,2018,07,14
209,Perfect location ,"Top class hotel, very good service. Accommodation was as one would expect. I didn’t have dinner here but the breakfast was very good. A short walk to St Stephen’s Green and numerous restaurants. Good WiFi.

",5,2018,07,14
209,A disappointing stay but staff was outstanding,"First, the staff at the Conrad Dublin was fantastic.  Our issues were with the guest rooms.  First, our rooms were not ready at check-in and were not ready even two hours later.  We ended up being put in another room that was ready, but that was directly across from an elevator (so we ended up having to switch rooms). The rooms were all clean, but the sofa in our first room was torn with the stuffing coming out.  In the second room, a portion of the shower knob was missing and you could see broken pieces of plastic inside.  This didn't affect the shower working, but that was surprising.  On our third day, we came back from breakfast to find our ceiling dripping water all over the floor from the cooling unit.  The staff was very responsive and fixed it immediately, but this was also unexpected.  On our last day, neither of our keys worked, so we had to go down to the front desk to have them re-programmed.  Finally, the coffee machine (Nespresso) in both rooms didn't work consistently.  Yes, we could go downstairs at get coffee at the restaurant, but it was just one more thing that was a disappointment in the property itself.  The location is great, the staff is great, but I'm not sure we'll stay there again, based on all of the problems we had on this last trip.  ",3,2018,07,13
209,Could find no fault,"Beds are comfy, air conditioning worked great, quiet, very clean, lots of attention to the details in both interior design and service.  The breakfast was exceptional.  Maybe a touch busy at time, and had a hard time locating a waitress, but overall a great experience.",5,2018,07,12
209,in Dublin's fair city,This hotel was state of the art with very good attentive service and upscale decor. The food was also very good. The location is excellent for attending a performing arts event & for short walks to St. Stephen part and many good pubs and restaurants.,5,2018,07,09
209,Fantastic stay,"My family and I recently stayed at the Conrad. I can’t say enough about the quality of service and the hotel itself.  The rooms are very clean and comfortable.  The hotel staff is extremely attentive. I was traveling with my handicapped mother and the hotel staff couldn’t have been kinder or more helpful when needed.  Additionally , the hotel is located very close to St Stephens park and in ideal location. I highly recommend the Conrad!",5,2018,07,09
209,Wonderful Stay,"I stayed here with my wife and two children for one night in July.  I stayed with points and actually received an upgrade to a Conrad Suite, which was a great size for 2 adults and 2 small children.  The room had a sizable living room with a sofa bed, with a small round table.  The king bed in the bedroom was firm, but comfortable.  The bathroom was ensuite and had a separate tub and shower.  We had a nice view of the National Concert Hall from both rooms.  The room number was 436.  The room had a great color scheme and didn’t have any signs of wear and tear that I could see.  It also had great touches such as a framed Oscar Wilde quote and numerous books not the shelf, along with a very cool globe that doubled as a night light.  
Liam, the Guest Relations Manager, was particularly great.  He had 2 ‘Lemmy’ Lamb plush toys sent to our room along arranged in a lovely scene with chocolates and coconut “grass”.  I communicated with him pre-stay and he was always responsive.  Gary, at the door, was also very nice and took the time to show us the features of the room when dropping the bags.  We used the app to request services and it worked well.  We received a code for free WIFI at check in.  
We ate at the Coburg twice, for breakfast and dinner, and it was very good with very reasonable prices for a hotel restaurant.  Kim waited on us in the morning and she was very attentive and welcoming.  I liked the bacon and the bread board the best and my wife thought the onion soup was quite delicious.  
The location is just off the southeast corner of St Stephens Green.  A taxi from the airport costs about €30-35 each way.  I would recommend it and would stay here again.  ",5,2018,07,06
209,Top Dublin property,"The Conrad is located a few blocks off the Green.  For my recent stay, the service was seamless and flawless from start to finish.  The concierge helped with booking cabs and navigating street closures - no small feat - and everything went off without a hitch.  Room was spacious (by European standards) with a great, comfortable bed and a nicely appointed bathroom (nb - step in tub/shower combo for those needing to know). Desk had various outlets for charging (US/UK-IRL/EU) as well as USB ports - plenty of speace for me to work even in a ""regular"" room.  

Only minor nuisance was a noisy room of people down the hall - but that is their fault, not the hotel's.

This would be a choice for a repeat stay if in town on business or pleasure.",5,2018,07,05
209,Great Place to stay in Dublin,"Booked the hotel for our quarterly Business Meeting. Was not disappointed. Exactly the kind of service I expect from a hotel of this category. From booking process ( our ever changing demands were all catered for ), competent & attentive front desk staff, lovely breakfast, great meeting facilities & staff, delicious food ( big compliments to the kitchen !) Working with such friendly and professional people, makes my live very much easier.",5,2018,07,05
209,Amazing 5 Star Experience ,"We checked into the hotel this morning and we were greeted with offers of red, white or blue water to celebrate the 4th. 
Being a Diamond member we very much had a memorable experience at check-in.  Jack was very professional and accommodating. 

The bar in the hotel, Lemuel’s, was awesome!!  Steve and the team spent extra time to make recommendations based on the experience we were looking for.  Steve also knew a manager at a restaurant and called him so he would expect us and create another memorable experience. 

We had a great time and I would recommend the Conrad Hilton and Lemuel’s to anyone.  ",5,2018,07,04
209,Woken at 7.15am by noisy construction works,"A fundamental part of a hotel stay is getting a good night sleep. Unfortunately during our one night stay we didn't.

We got a late flight into Dublin, and checked into the hotel looking forward to a good nights sleep after a long day. 

At 7.15am on a Saturday morning we were woken up by construction work at the site next door, there were multiple deliveries being made, all reversing onto site with the accompanying beeping warning noises. This was also then accompanied by a continual stream of loud bangs, which sounded like metal being banged against metal. The room clearly had little noise insulation, and we certainly had no intention to be up that early.

On checking out, we were asked whether we had experienced a good stay, we explained that we hadn't due to the construction noise. We were just told - ""that site isn't anything to do with us"" - whilst I appreciate the construction site isn't part of the hotel's premises, I would have thought the hotel might have the courtesy to inform and warn their guests that there is construction ongoing next door and there may be some associated noise.

Quite simply we book into a hotel to primarily get a good nights sleep, and if you want to get a good nights sleep I certainly wouldn't book into this hotel anytime soon - especially as they don't have the courtesy to tell you about this potential noise disturbance prior to booking (we booked direct on the Hilton website!).",1,2018,07,03
209,Excellent Service....,"Quite honestly, I was disappointed with the service during this stay at the Dublin Conrad Hilton.. Having stayed at the hotel numerous times, I was a little shocked over the assigned room and should have questioned the selection provided to me as soon as I entered the room. Very disappointing!  It was, however, up to the usual Conrad level of cleanliness. My meal in the dining room was excellent.",5,2018,07,02
209,Great location and fine service,"We stayed five nights in June at the Conrad. It is one block from St. Stephen's Green and the heart of activity south of the River Liffey, which includes Temple Bar, Trinity College, the National Museums of Ireland, the National Gallery, St. Patricks and Christ Church Cathedrals, and Grafton Street shopping. Rooms were well appointed, with tea/coffee makers, a great work area with US compatible outlets, and spacious baths. Staff was outstanding. Check in was friendly and accommodating. We had breakfast each morning at the Coburg Brasserie. The waitstaff went above and beyond to make us comfortable, and the breakfast buffet had everything one could wish for and more. We have already recommended this hotel to another family planning a week-long stay in Dublin, and will absolutely return again. Moreover, my husband travels to Ireland for business, and he liked the work area in our room better than the hotel his company previously used. They will be using the Conrad for future visits.",5,2018,06,30
209,Dublin with son,"Amazing hotel and great service and comfortable rooms. There was construction going on in back of our room but in general, noise was reasonable. Room and beds very comfortable. Breakfast has extremely high quality. Nice gym. Friendly staff. ",5,2018,06,29
209,Outstanding service @ very nice hotel,"Highly recommended!
Staff is awesome!
Easy check in (on-line with Hhonors app) and all set with out room. 
Concierge/Bellhop was very helpful. Not just with bags and room but how to get around in new city and when/where is best bet (considering all the activities going on around town at the time). 
Lounge and restaurant staff also very help with where to go and “out of the way” places to see in our travels around Ireland. ",5,2018,06,29
209,Amazing Staff,"We spent the first two nights of our 10 night stay in Ireland at the Conrad.  I travel frequently and had high standards when it comes to service and doing the right thing.  I had contacted the hotel prior to arriving and requested an upgrade, if possible, as well as an early check in.  They were able to accommodate the upgrade...we had an amazing one bedroom suite...but unfortunately, we were not able to get into our room for just over three hours, which was disappointing after a day of travel from the west coast of the US.  But the staff was so gracious and apologetic...especially Michael from the Hilton Honors desk and Nicoleta in the bar.  I cannot say enough positive things about these two in particular.  To be fair, check-in at the hotel is at 3:00 and we arrived at noon but it would have been so appreciated had we been able to have our room prioritized for housekeeping.  Others arrived after us and were able to get into their rooms sooner.  Regardless, we loved our room and the location of the hotel and I would definitely stay there again.",5,2018,06,29
209,Fantastic place,"Dashing and totally at the top of the list for hotel accommodation in Dublin. l stayed here for a couple of weeks while travelling for business. Upon entry you are met with lovely, friendly (not too nosey) staff. I swear they never made me feel like I was checking in or like I was incapable of finding the check in desk... or maybe they just treat you as a returning guest who knows the 5 star place but that was brilliant. If you get to stay here... the rooms are great and some don't have a great view but you will appreciate that it's bang in the centre of Dublin, just a few minutes away from Temple Bar and the St Stephen's Green Park is just a stone throw away. The hotel and services are exceptionally remarkable. Special thanks should go to Fanni, Coleen and Alexia who deliver outstanding room service and make your day with their genuine kindness, smile and positive attitude and the magically memorable preparation of food and beverages.",5,2018,06,28
209,The very BEST!,The very BEST! Staying at the Conrad Dublin made our visit to Dublin and Ireland that much more exceptional. The staff - AMAZING! The location - PERFECT! The accommodations - First Class! I will recommend Conrad Dublin to all travelling to the fair city of Dublin. Cheers!,5,2018,06,26
209,Amazing,"Top breakfast, top rooms, plus interconnecting with kids, and top restaurant.. concierge amazing .. nothing to complain. Had a blasting experience in Dublin. Just little 10 min walk to Grafton Street. Bit closer would have been made it perfect spot. Gonna visit again whenever in Dublin again.",5,2018,06,26
209,Nice stay,Good location and within walking distance to shopping and restauarants. Some construction going on behind hotel but noise was minimal. Fitness center was adequate. Laundry service was good but we had to call for our stuff to be delivered.,4,2018,06,26
209,Great service but nearby construction can be bothersome,Rooms are good sized for Dublin (slightly smaller than US standards) and include just about every amenity you would want. King size bed was comfortable and the bathroom was large. Service is high touch. The breakfast included with my status was fantastic. Be aware there is construction going on directly next to the hotel. You will be woken up by noise at 7am. One night there was some sort of site alarm that kept going off all night.,4,2018,06,24
209,Outstanding customer service,"We arrived in Dublin at 7:30 A.M. & arrived at our hotel at 9am. The front desk let us drop our bags, freshen up in the restroom & called me when the room was ready, which was only an hour or so later. Everyone was so friendly & accommodating, the rooms were nice & beds comfortable. 
We had drinks in the bar that night & received outstanding service from Shane the bartender & another gentleman whose name we didn’t catch. They were swamped but very entertaining & talented at their craft. 
I asked if they had any bags for ice as I have a sprained ankle & they both went to find me a bag, some ice & a towel to wrap around it. Shane also gave us tips on sightseeing & restaurants in Dingle, very much appreciated. 
I’m a frequent business traveler & have to say that many hotels worldwide could benefit from your hospitality model. I’d definitely stay again!",4,2018,06,23
209,"Wonderful rooms, comfortable and quiet. Great location.","We were only in Dublin one night, and really enjoyed our stay at the Conrad. Clean rooms, big bathrooms, comfortable beds and pillows. Location is across from a beautiful park, and on the other side of the park is a shopping district.  We toured by car, so I'm not sure how close to attractions.",5,2018,06,22
209,One night stay,"Staff is very helpful, knew all the restaurants to go to. Rooms were clean and comfortable.
Recommend highly. The restaurants in the hotel are very nice. Breakfast buffet was good and menu was expansive",4,2018,06,21
209,Great hotel and location,"Stayed as part of a business trip. Very welcoming at check-in and the lobby area is nicely decorated.  I did get upgraded which was nice after a long day of travel.  

The location was great just a block or 2 from Stephens green and walking distance to a lot in Dublin.  

I like to use the fitness center when arriving after a long flight.  It’s relatively small but adequate.  Enough cardio equipment and some free weights and a machine.  It’s located on the lower level and depending on the time of day there was quite a bit of house keeping items temporarily in that area on the way to the fitness center.  

There are 2 places to eat the restaurant and a bar area. They are related but separate.  The first night it was getting late so I just wanted a quick bite and drink.  The drinks were the highlights.  The cocktails were creative and expertly prepared.  Had some good dialogue with the bartenders while I was seating there.  The bar has a separate menu from the restaurant and is basically small bite/portion type items.  They also stop serving food in the bar around 9pm but the restaurant is open later if needed.  I went to the restaurant for breakfast each morning and it was included even items off the menu.  I’m guessing there is a link to HH status but mine was no charge.  

The room itself was quite comfortable and importantly the AC was able to keep the room cool.  I liked the fact that there was mouthwash in the room as well as a small luffa pad that could be used in the shower and a new one was part of the daily toiletry items.  

The price is a little high but I thought it was worth particularly the service at the front desk, bar, and restaurant was top notch. ",5,2018,06,20
209,Conrad Dublin review,"Had a great time in this hotel. Service was five star, great location very close to city Centre and Lots to do. 
Reception check in was very quick and also given drink vouchers to enjoy in the bar. Staff nice. Breakfast was exceptionally good great variety the lady doing the buffet was very helpful and polite, also our waitress Jodie who looked after us the two mornings we had breakfast there was cheerful, extremely helpful and also as busy as she was she took time to write out a list of places to visit in Dublin and gave it to us the next time she saw us a really personal touch. Great customer service all round and a beautifully decorated hotel.",5,2018,06,19
209,Afternoon Tea,Myself and a friend bought a voucher for afternoon tea in the Conrad. We had a lovely afternoon and really enjoyed it. I would have loved if the scones where a bit bigger but overall the food & tea were perfect. We were served by Nicoletta who was a super host. She was so friendly and welcoming. She was very hospitable when I told her about an a food allergy which isn't always the case. We will definitely be back soon :).,5,2018,06,19
209,Needs Improvement,"This hotel needs some serious improvement. I have a lot of constructive criticism, so I will list it in bullets: 

* The staff was rude in the craft beer bar. We waited five minutes by the door and no one sat us or told us to seat ourselves. We tried to get the bartender’s attention, and he ignored us.

* The breakfast is not included in the outrageous price of this hotel. It’s a five star hotel, and it doesn’t have an included continental breakfast? The group that owns this hotel also owns the Dublin Custom House, which is a more economical hotel, and the Custom House includes a breakfast (which tasted better).  

* The sink and toilet made some very concerning noises. The plumbing was very odd. The water temperature was very erratic. Also the bathtub is very dangerous. It’s easy to slip and fall on your way out. 

* The hotel is over priced. For a five star hotel, it needs to up its game. ",2,2018,06,19
209,Conrad Dublin,"The location of the hotel was excellent.  The city center is pretty loud, so it was nice to be able to retreat to the tranquility of the Conrad.  That said, the hotel felt a bit lifeless.  The staff were helpful and friendly; however, overall, the hotel felt empty--despite being (allegedly) fully booked.  The rooms were comfortable but also felt lifeless and a bit tired.  This is a bit of a harsh review but that is probably because I stayed at a boutique hotel in London right after my stay at the Conrad--and the boutique experience torched the Conrad.  Otherwise, good hotel, in a great location, just lacks personality and zest.",3,2018,06,18
209,Nicoletta,"We had lunch at Conrad. We werw served by a very beautiful girl, named Nicoletta.
She was very nice, very attentive, polite. She smiles all the time. We had a very good time at this hotel cause of her.
We recommand you Conrad Hotels- Nicoletta!",5,2018,06,18
209,Lovely property,We have completed our stay here at the Hilton and have had the best  time. The hotel is beautiful and the staff is exemplary!!  Each and every request was fulfilled and always with a smile. The hotel is the epitome of the Irish people. Rich in heart and soul. You won’t be disappointed!,5,2018,06,18
209,Tea,"Had tea at the Conrad Hotel yesterday which was a very pleasant experience. We enjoyed excellent  service and a lovely, big, airy but still friendly space. The ambience was cool and the atmosphere was warm. ",4,2018,06,17
209,"friendly, caring and beautiful","The hotel is beautiful and the room was large and nicely decorated.  This is a 5 star hotel that merits its designation.  The staff is friendly, and the breakfast is amazing. The hotel is in a good location within walking distance to many sites.",5,2018,06,16
209,Beautiful experience,Our son got married in Wicklow Gardens and most of the guests who came stayed at the Conrad Dublin and had a wonderful experience!  The rooms were very clean and comfortable.   The breakfast was delicious and all the employees throughout the hotel were wonderful!,5,2018,06,16
209,"Great location, better property. ",Five star property and service just minutes away from all the pub and restaurant activities. Really felt welcomed. Complete renovation in 2017 and they an amazing job. Food selection was superb on property as well. ,5,2018,06,16
209,Above and beyond management care,"We checked into the hotel for a five night stay and will be leaving tomorrow.  After a rough start, we were initially moved upon checkin due to a very warm room and eventually moved the 2nd day to a complimentary upgraded to a junior suite.  While it is not this hotel managements fault, European hotels are typically known as not having real AC in rooms (or very minimal) but do in common areas such as reception and restaurants.  Probably even more so in Dublin with its northern climate!  My wife has MS so this is a bigger problem for us traveling as hear is the worse thing for her condition.  In any event, this hotel management went above and beyond to supply us multiple fans and even a larger room for our 14 year old son so that he could have a sofa sleeper.  Also provided us a wheelchair one day when ours was out of service for the day and some free drink coupons. As a long HHonors member, we appreciate the extra efforts!",5,2018,06,14
209,Definitely not 5 star.,Paid €535 for a midweek stay and it has been so disappointing. The room has obviously been ‘made over’ by painting up old wood. The lift sounds like it’s about to break. The view is off a weedy flat roof of the adjoining building. On arriving to the room we went to the mini bar to have a nice drink to find it  Unstocked and on arriving back after dinner and wanting something sweet we were told all we could have is ice cream. No turn down no chocolates nothing that makes it feel special. We really wish we stayed loyal to the nearby hotels we usually stay in. I have never wrote a negative review before but I would hate someone to make the same mistake we did. More 3 star than 5 star.,1,2018,06,13
209,"Great location, great experience!","We stayed at the Conrad on June 11th for the last night of a family trip to Ireland. The location, so close to St Stephen’s Green and Grafton Street was perfect without being in the misdst of the tourist traffic. The staff were very welcoming and helpful in every way. The room was spotless, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. Definitely highly recommended for comfort, style, location and superlative service. ",5,2018,06,13
209,Near St. Stephens Green: a major location!,"To be able to walk to Grafton St. area in 11-15 minutes, diagonally, through the  beautiful gift of nature called St. Stephens Green is A+! ! ! !Mind you, you are near where everything  is happening, however, the hotel area is quiet and serene. 

        In reception,Michael  and David greeted us  in a cheerful manner, which is needed when one anticipates the advent of jet lag. We were too early. Michael escorted us into Lemuels, the all day brasserie/bar and Martin brought us 2 American coffees. Maria, served us pastries and we only waited for 30 minutes to go to room 312, which I recommend for it's location and wonderful king size bed!

       The next day hostess Kubra Perver  selected very comfortable seats & explained the breakfast buffet. This is mt 12th time in Dublin and I thought this breakfast was for Royalty!  Even Henry VIII, with his brobdingnagian appetite could not eat all the delectable selections in the buffet. Variety was the spice of life in this room. Moreover, if you preferred something else, there were other menu choices.  In 2 hours,we will be eating dinner. Great, as we will have lamb stew. Fine. BUT, I am waiting to awaken tomorrow morning for breakfast!

              I will admit this  review is not balanced and food is very important to me. In addition, the reception staff, the room care staff, Christopher who brought our bags up and demonstrated all the advance technology in the room---everyone here is wonderful. What a start to our 47 day holiday. Trust me. This is where you want to stay>Conrad Hilton! Don't even think about anywhere else!",5,2018,06,11
209,Definitely a 5 star establishment. Everything first class.,"My girlfriend had always wanted to go to Dublin. It was her 21st birthday coming up so as a surprise, I booked a weekend in Dublin staying at Conrad for her. 
I booked the Romance in Dublin weekend in a king premier room with balcony. The cost was €640 a night so for the weekend I paid €1920. It might sound like a lot of money but it was well worth it - and the €80 Euro tip!! 
Conrad is a no smoking hotel which was perfect for us as neither of us smoke. We are also very sporty and love the gym so having a fitness centre within the hotel was ideal. 
Check in was at 3.00pm. We arrived about 3.30pm and check in was very quick and efficient. All the reception staff were really friendly, chatty and helpful. 
Our room was absolutely stunning. The attention to detail was first class and the room was spotless. 
It had high ceilings so it felt very spacious and beautifully decorated. The bed was extremely comfortable and the facilities were definitely 5 star. 
We had a huge tv, an nespresso machine and a mini bar which was very handy! There was also room service there when we wanted it. 
We had free WiFi which was great too. 
We had dinner at the Coburg Brasserie and the food was excellent. Once again the service was impeccable. 
The hotel is situated in Earlsfort Terrace and overlooks the national concert hall. St Stephen's green is just across from the hotel. 
The cobbled streets and the old winding roads help to create an amazing experience. Dublin is a beautiful place to visit and Conrad is a first class, 5 star hotel. We had a lovely time and would definitely book here again. 
It had everything for us - fitness centre, no smoking, perfect location and the best facilities. My girlfriend had an unforgettable weekend and a lovely 21st birthday. Thank you to everyone at Conrad for helping me to give my girlfriend a time to remember. The weekend cost €2000 for the hotel but it was worth every single penny. It may sound expensive but you pay for quality and this place is quality all the way. 
Don't hesitate and book Conrad, you won't regret it.",5,2018,06,09
209,Really Nice Hotel in a Good Location,"This is a true five star hotel at the southern end of Dublin. It is located across from St. Stephen’s Green, close to cool restaurants and pubs on Braggot St., and a short walk to city center. It is very comfortable, clean, and well appointed. I would absolutely stay here again in the future. ",5,2018,06,07
209,Typical Hilton great Dublin location,Located one block from Saint Stephen’s Green. Easy walking distance to most popular tourist attractions.Luxury accommodations slightly less expensive than some of the classic Dublin hotels.Staff were universally helpful and efficient. In hotel pub served excellent barfood.,5,2018,06,07
209,Totally First Class,"This was our third stay at the Conrad.  Situated at the corner of Stephen's Green and opposite the National Concert Hall, the Conrad is a truly great hotel, not only in its accommodations and restaurants but also in its staff.  We have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone planning a stay in Dublin.",5,2018,06,06
209,Elegant hotel,"Beautiful and elegant hotel.  Very lucky to be upgraded to a suite, WOW. The rooms are large and nicely appointed.  The staff was great.  Seems to be in a quite area although I think a concert hall was directly across the street.  St Stephen Green is about 3 minutes away, and if you walk through the park, you end up on Grafton street for very nice shopping.",5,2018,06,06
209,The best hotel in Dublin,"Great hotel near St.Stephen's Green park (enjoy a sunny day outside !) and in the walking distance  from most tourist attractions . The people were amazing and did everything for you to enjoy your staying  there . Rooms are crispy clean , beds were comfortable  , like at home , beddings - white,  soft and very ""european "" . Rooms are big , close to American standards. 
Breakfast  was a Buffett  with always fresh bakings and few egg dishes you can order . Waiters were friendly and always helpful  . Highly recommend to stay there",5,2018,06,05
209,Conrad Stay Pre Cruise,We stayed two nights pre cruise at the Conrad.  We arrived from the Airport at 10AM. I had requested an early check in which we received.  The room looked to have been recently updated.  There was an excellent buffet breakfast included.  The Hotel has a perfect location with great customer service and when we return to Dublin we will most definitely stay at the Conrad again.,5,2018,06,04
209,Fantastic Customer Service!,My wife and I stayed at the Conrad Dublin for 2 nights recently.  The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance to many Dublin attractions.  The breakfast buffet is excellent and we found the service and food to be very good in both Lemuel's Bar and Alfie Byrne's.  The morning of our departure I realized that I had misplaced my sunglasses at a nearby shopping center.  I spoke to Kemal Puljic at Conrad Guest Services and he offered to retrieve them and arrange to have them shipped to me.  This is the type of terrific customer service that we have come to expect at Conrad's worldwide - thank you Kemal!    ,5,2018,06,03
209,Surprised it was Conrad,"This is a Hilton regular hotel at best, certainly not a Conrad. The staff was not very welcoming and the rooms were standard. Given their prices compared to other Hilton’s in Dublin, certainly not worth it. They are centrally located, if that is a key reason for booking.",2,2018,06,02
209,Meh... Not worth the price or name,"This hotel should be a Hilton property, not a Conrad. This property does not have a Spa, no executive lounge, or anything particularly special about it. As a diamond member, I was not upgraded upon arrival. I asked the front desk to notify me if any rooms come available, however they never got back to me. A day into the say called down to the front desk to check on the lounge situation and they stated they don't have a lounge but could offer me free drink vouchers. Why did I need to ask for this benefit?

The breakfast situation is really backwards. First you get a table, and sit down for a buffet (which is included as part of Hilton Honors). You must then wait for a server for your coffee, and TOAST(you can't toast your own toast)! Try to flag someone down, my wife and I tried to make eye contact and even flag servers down without any luck. The breakfast buffet leaves quite a bit to be desired compared to other Conrad's I have stayed in.

The room is okay, but again nothing to compare to other Conrads. The shower/bath is so far above the floor, you need a large step to get to it. The bed is very firm, and the room is not too large. Only two elevators for the entire property, which causes some delays.

Location, this property is in a business area, and it is not easy to get a cab. Keep this in mind as you will need to order a cab ahead of time to get anywhere, because they don't just come down the hotel's street. 

For the price I paid, clearly this place can improve quite a bit.",3,2018,06,01
209,Very nice!,"This is a very nice hotel, beautiful rooms, friendly staff and a few different restaurants on site to choose from if you don't feel like going out. But, if you do want to go out, it is pretty conveniently located, right near St Stephen's Green and a hop on hop off bus stop. We really enjoyed our stay here.",5,2018,06,01
209,The Good The Bad The Ugly,"Our first stay together in Dublin and in a Conrad Hotel:
Well I’m in the good books know.
I was in the middle of trying to figure out how to get to the hotel the day prior to leaving , when the hotels email arrived confirming details etc.

After a quick email to a gentleman called Liam from reservations the detailed transfer information from the airport to the hotel arrived.

Before leaving uk , another email arrived indicating our room was ready,which made us laugh.

Transfer.
From the airport to the hotel is exceptionally easy.

Go out of the terminal ,turn left and look for a green bus number 757.

Next to that is a kiosk to purchase the return ticket for bus.

The 757 drops you approximately 30 paces from the Conrad Entrance.

The Hotel
It’s situated in a good location, close to St Stephens green a well known land mark and the shopping district, so you won’t get lost.

The Hotel 
Check in was nice and quick , with clear information on the room and the Hotel amenities, which is good as we had a lot to try and see on our 2 day trip to Dublin.

Rooms
We where Very pleased with the whole room really .
From the size and the cleanliness to great supply and pressure of the hot water to the decent coffee provided and replenished through out our stay.

The Bar
We had a few drinks / cocktails in the bar, my wife loved the cocktails.
Their was quite a selection to chose from, I just stuck to the Guinness 
The service was very good.

The Restaurant 
We Stayed in for  a meal in the 2nd night of our stay.
We both really enjoyed the food.
The soups for starters were great , 
We tried the Guinness and onion soup with a Guinness bread, ( A Must try for anyone).
I had the roasted tomatoes and basil , that was tasty as well.
We had  the rib-eye steak and the sea bass along with a few side dishes.
All cooked to our liking , the service was excellent.

Breakfast 
I’m not sure what to say really.
I couldn’t find anything that wasn’t available for the asking.
One thing I loved was the fresh honey , straight from the hive.

All in all a totally good choice for us, and will return on our next visit to Ireland.

",5,2018,05,31
209,Excellent,"A thoroughly enjoyable stay at the centrally located Dublin Conrad. 
My partner and I received excellent treatment as Hilton Diamond members, including an upgrade to a well-designed newly renovated suite – it was spacious and bright, and had this - often elusive - feeling of home away from home rather than just another hotel room – with pieces of art and books thoughtfully selected and placed. 
All members of staff were incredibly friendly; breakfast was lovely – absolutely nothing to complain about. 
Would certainly come back and recommend!",5,2018,05,29
209,A+ Staff,"SUMMARY:  Great location near many tourist areas and close to Trinity College.  Airport Bus across the street. Rooms are luxurious Conrad Quality, but really the staff... A++

LOCATION:  Open up a map and have a look at how close all of the tourist spots are and Conrad, particularly if you're a Hilton member should absolutely go on the list. From the outside, it looks like a small boutique, but it has all the nice finishes as soon as you walk in.  I really prefer taking the no hassle airport bus which drops off and picks up a few feet in front of this hotel. 

STAFF:  I looked so the vagabond traveler in backpacker clothes. I failed to book correctly. Staff was beyond nice about it, quickly giving me a username and password and sorting me out with a seat in the lobby to check it out. They even answered my many 1000s of questions as I checked in about the area and printed out the airport bus schedule without my asking.  I think it's the manager (who I spoke with) that runs a tight ship as relates to service. I mean, super charmingly nice about the situation I caused for myself.  Connor (?) the young newer staff member was super nice and efficient in helping to get me sorted once the reservation booked through on my Hilton app. They were all so kind.  I considered going to a different spot closer to the bars, but decided to stay just because people were so nice. 

THE ROOMS:  I couldn't get upgraded because I'd booked so late and none were left. They were nearly fully booked when I arrived. That said, the room I had on the 3rd floor was fantastic. Quite large with the comforts of Conrad that I know and love. 

OTHER: The only sad thing is no Conrad bear. I think it's more an Asian thing. I asked and they mentioned they do have a Conrad lamb, but they make so few that they only give them to Super VIPS (not even the platinum members all get them).  Maybe they could sell them for die hard Conrad fans. I would love to see a lamb version of the Conrad bear.",5,2018,05,29
209,"Good Stay, Good Staff","My wife and I stayed two nights at the Conrad, Dublin in late May, 2018.  Almost everything went well.

The hotel is fairly new and located in a very safe area.  It's not close, but not too far, to most of the sights you'd probably want to see in Dublin.

The room we had was large and well appointed.  They provided two stands for our suitcases which was nice.  The bed was comfortable and the linens provided were nice.  The bath was reasonably large and the towels were nice. 

We only ate breakfast in the restaurant but the breakfast provided was adequate and hot food could be ordered off the menu.

The Internet access was easy to connect to and was fast - thanks!. 

The air conditioning was essentially non-existent.  No matter what I did, the room would not cool down.  I was told that when the hotel was refurbished, the old, poorly working air conditioners were left in the rooms.

The staff was excellent.  Always there to help and to give advice about things to do and places to go in Dublin.  They were much appreciated.

Except for the A/C, it was an excellent stay and recommended.",4,2018,05,29
209,Conrad Dublin,Spent six nights at Conrad Dublin. Beautiful hotel and outstanding service. Highly recommend the breakfast. Hotel staff was so attentive. On the days we had tours they had a cab waiting and breakfast boxed. Room was always clean. Will be returning!,5,2018,05,28
209,Wonderful Stay,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The room was very spacious and clean.  The maid service was very attentive.  The food was very good at the restaurant.  We ate both breakfast and dinner in the main dining room.  The service there was excellent.  It was apparent that the staff was very well trained.
The staff at the front desk was very helpful and professional.  The location of the hotel was very good as we could walk to several parks and restaurants.",5,2018,05,28
209,Brilliant Dublin hotel in the midst of everything,"From the early check-in......most appreciated after a long overnight Atlantic flight, to the thoughtfully placed USB and US plugs, to the cozy bar with quiet nooks for long chats, this hotel was 5 star all the way.",5,2018,05,28

209,Great hotel in a great location,Stayed at the Conrad Dublin for 5 nights on a business trip. Had a great experience. The hotel is very nicely appointed and has very friendly staff and good service. The location is fantastic and a short walk to the center of all the buzz and restaurants and bars. Can’t go wrong with this hotel.,4,2018,05,28
209,Comfortable stay & great location,"The hotel service was excellent in every way. The staff assisted us with the planning of our 5 night stay, making it one of our most memorable trips ever!  We were within walking distance of the heart of the city, enabling us to take in many Dublin highlights (& pubs!).  We enjoyed a fantastic breakfast each morning, staffed by the most friendly & helpful employees. Liam, the guest relations manager, made sure our anniversary was unforgettable!",5,2018,05,27

209,First visit to Ireland!,"My adult daughter and I stayed at The Conrad Dublin for 2 nights on our way to a business trip in Waterford.  The accommodations were very nice, modern, and clean, and we had all of the traveler's conveniences you would expect in a luxury hotel.  The valets and front desk managers were welcoming and accomodating and gave great advice on sightseeing.  We enjoyed a cocktail and appetizer in the hotel bar both nights and especially appreciated service by Alina!",5,2018,05,25

The staff is absolutely wonderful!  I felt so welcomed by the Front Desk & Valet they were always kind & very helpful. 
One person that really stood out to me was a sweet woman named Alina in the bar.  It was her first week and she was so kind, attentive, and accommodating!  We wish her all the best and appreciate her excellent customer service!",5,2018,05,25
209,Outstanding,"I think it good travel advice to stay at a quality hotel and the Conrad has been magnificent!

209,“Excellent on All Accounts”,"Stayed in a Jr Suite.   Staff was excellent, rooms clean & spacious, and concierge desk was extremely helpful and willing to assist.  Assistant Front of House Manager, Philip reached out to me before, during, and after my stay to ensure accommodations were to our satisfaction.  As a diamond member not traveling for business, Philip, the staff and hotel went out of their way to make sure every detail was the best it could be for my family.  A great place to relax and experience Dublin.  Excellent on all accounts.",5,2018,05,24
209,Great Location,"Top tier hotel and accommodations. Easy walking to nearly all sights in the city. The bar is great, but do check out the pub that is located in the ""basement"". Food and service was exceptional as well.",5,2018,05,23
209,One of the best 5-star hotels in the world and the BEST staff in the world,"I felt compelled to write a detailed review, the hotel staff deserve it.

I am a Hilton diamond member, I stay at Hilton properties when I can, especially Conrad which are to a higher standard, but I also am fortunate enough to frequent many 5-star boutique and privately owned hotels throughout the world on business and leisure.  Europe has some of the best... I visit Geneva often, which is home to many fine 5-star hotels, and is a standard which many people look to.

For my mom's 70th birthday I took her and my brother to Dublin, then Switzerland. Dublin was first.  I have been to Dublin a few times prior, and prior to realizing a Conrad was in town.  Previously I stayed with my wife at the reknowned Merion Hotel.  That experience was lovely and we enjoy classic European hotels, but to be honest, for the price the room was nothing special and the service was good but a bit too uptight and spotty.  

On to the Conrad...  Liam the customer relations manager saw to it that my mom had a special room.  Regardless of my diamond status it was nice to know prior to arriving that at least she would have something special to look forward to.  In addition, we had a very early arrival (5am) and Liam and his staff enabled us to get a full day of Dublin in by having a room ready for check-in super early so we could get some sleep right away.  I met Liam and his energy and can-do attitude is a model that other hotel managers should strive toward.  Damien was the person who checked us in and was extremely helpful, caring and explained each and every detail of the hotel to us. It was like we were family coming to visit a home that they are extremely proud of.  Our bell staff was also the best I have ever encountered.  It was as though we had a person assigned specifically to us.  After the first day he knew us by name and knew exactly what our plans were for the day to try and help when we arrived back at the hotel and during departure.  Honestly, I have never seen anything like it.  He even came into the restaurant bar late one evening once he saw me to ensure I was enjoying the time and had everything I needed.

Their junior suites are wonderfully spacious, thoughtfully appointed and are full of modern luxuries.  Even the more standard rooms are clean, comfortable, bright and airy.  Beds, linens and pillows are a delight.  The hotel pictures online do not do the rooms justice.  I believe it is because the color tones are light and fresh and not captured well in photos, but in person they are absolutely wonderful rooms.  Light wood tones, crisp white linens, luxury accent pillows and textiles, and the green tones of nearby St. Stephens Green as inspiration.  The junior suite had plenty of nooks with books, artwork and other surprises.  The rooms also have US electrical sockets built in!  My mom commented at the end of the trip that she preferred the Conrad room to the Hotel Beau Rivage in Geneva...which I must tell you is a restored palace and overlooks the lake in Geneva and cost over $850 per night.

All food and rinks were wonderful, the lobby bar has unexpectedly reasonably priced drinks for a 5 star hotel, and top spirit selections.  Hotel breakfast was impressive in all areas, from fresh squeezed orange juice to the included full Irish breakfast.

The hotel's location is second to none.  Less than 1 block to the entrance to St. Stephens Green, 5-7 minute walk to Merion square area with excellent music pub and FX Buckley off Pembroke St. for steak, 5 minutes to House Dublin (great bar and afternoon tea) 7-10 minute walk to center of Grafton Street, walkable to major Churches and off to Guiness storehouse by walk or short taxi.

I love Dublin due to its friendly people and excellent starting point to explore the beauty of Ireland; but the Conrad completely takes things to a new level and should be the strongest consideration in Dublin if looking for the perfect 5-star hotel. Perhaps not traditionally decorated, but then again, Dublin really isn't your traditional city.

Thank you Conrad in Dublin, we will return.",5,2018,05,23
209,Incredible Experience!,"The service, location and accommodations were incredible! From the moment we arrived the Staff went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and they made sure every request was met. Christopher was especially exceptional-his service was superb.
The hotel has a modern vibe with a distinct atmosphere of class.
The rooms were spacious and beautifully decorated. The restaurant and bar area was upbeat and had great drink and wine selections.
We were able to walk to some great Pubs to listen to music and shop. St Stephen's Greens are also a short walk away. We have stayed at several hotels in Dublin throughout the years and this is our new favorite!",5,2018,05,21
209,WONDERFUL HOTEL,"Beautifully redecorated, great location, amazing staff..Really felt that the staff was happy to be at service.  We ate many meals in the restaurant because the selection and price were very good. Happy five days at Conrad Dublin.",5,2018,05,20

209,easy walking distance to all attractions.,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Conrad.  It is well located and our rooms were very comfortable.  There is some construction causing some noise issues on one side of the hotel (my brother's room) but ours was good.  The concierge service was good and we had an early flight, therefore departing the hotel at 5:oo a.m. and the staff prepared a beautiful take away breakfast for all 4 of us including HOT coffee. Much to our Delight!.
It ended up being the only food we really ate for 12 hours because of flight delays and running for connecting flights.  Thank you.",5,2018,05,19
209,Excellent hotel with great restaurant!,"Booked a suite for 7 days - spacious rooms, nicely decorated, extra large bathroom with separate tub and shower.

209,Good stay,"Stayed there 2 nights. Location is good but not perfect. Next to  the beautiful park, which is nice, but not much right next to it. 20+ min walk to some of the tourists attractions. Parking €20 per night. Rooms are big and clean. But walls are very thin so if you get loud neighbors (as I did) you will hear everything that’s going on in the room next to yours.  Fire alarm went on twice during my stay. First time after 11pm. Staff is very polite and attentive. If you have issues they try to solve it. They have a decent gym. Restaurant, bar and pub.

209,"Great hotel- warm, friendly, fantastic rooms and incredible service","The Conrad is one of those places that you dont want too many people to know about, because it feels like a private club, warmth of home and you dont want the secret out. We stayed here twice in the past couple of weeks, and will this our only hotel when we return to Dublin again. Rooms are so comfortable, really nice restaurants, and if you want an education in Irish Wiskey- head to the bar and be prepared to taste and learn. Terrific front desk staff and concierge.",5,2018,05,12
209,Lovely hotel and great location.,Stayed here for a few days while visiting Dublin.  Hotel was super clean and the staff was great.  The location can't be beat while staying in Dublin.

209,Great Experience. ,"We recently stayed at the Conrad from May 2 to the 5th. We traveled with four adults and a 19 month old.  We felt very welcomed by all the staff and I believed that they went out of the way to make it stay very accommodating , which the did. When we arrived with a rental car and I mentioned that I needed to return to the airport they took the time to see if other arrangements could be made to return in town. It worked out and saved my hours of hassle. Great job. We actually got a call from the bellman asking if we need any assistance on the morning of check out.  I found that very helpful. Very impressed with service. Probably one of the best experiences in my travels.  ",5,2018,05,07
209,"Great location - loved the ""extra's""","Not only is this property styled beautifully, but the location is perfect for a quick walk to some of the major tourist points and pubs of Dublin!

We were only here one night but will definitely make it a ""must stay"" when we visit Dublin again.",5,2018,05,07
209,Fabulous hotel - great location,"This 5-star hotel is located on the edge of St. Stephen’s Green park and is a quick 10-minute walk from pubs, shopping, restaurants and night life.  Apparently this hotel has been recently refurbished. The hotel is immaculate, well-maintained, contemporary, and nicely appointed.  The rooms have many electrical plugs for iPads, iPhones, etc!  The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I’ve experienced at a hotel, and the room was exceedingly quiet.  We stayed in a junior suite on the 6th floor.  There was even an ice machine on our floor (something hard to find overseas), and a fully stocked mini-frig in the room.  The room also had a wonderful Nespresso machine.  Our stay also included a full breakfast which we thoroughly enjoyed — omelets, scrambled eggs, and a lovely buffet of fruits, pastries, yogurts, etc.

I LOVED this hotel, the amenities, and the cordial, helpful staff.  I’d return in a heartbeat!  We were actually on vacation and fell in love with Dublin!",5,2018,05,04
209,A-Plus Hotel with Great Staff,"The Conrad Dublin is a truly excellent hotel, beautifully situated off Stephen's Green and in easy walking distance of restaurants, museums, shops, and so on. The staff is first-rate:  I had a dental problem on day 1 of a 2-week stay: they made an appointment for me with an excellent dentist who fixed it. Throughout our stay, they were knowledgeable, friendly and helpful.  Our room was light, airy and clean and the restaurant was excellent too.  Have the buffet breakfast:  it's gorgeous!",5,2018,05,01
209,Great base for seeing Dublin,"I hadn't been in the Conrad since before it was refurbished and it's improved hugely. We stayed here for a during a recent weekend in Dublin and had a great time. It's perfectly placed, right beside St Stephen's Green. The hotel is very nicely furnished and the room was big and bright, albeit a little on the warm side. The staff were exceptional and the breakfast was beautiful. I will definitely return when staying in Dublin.",5,2018,05,01
209,Outstanding ,Wonderful location near st Stephen green. Great place to walk or run. Lots of restaurant or pub choices near by.  Attentive staff wonderful breakfast and lovely rooms  the customer service is outstanding.  I selected rooms over looking park they were very bright ,5,2018,04,25
209,Overnight Stay,"Hotel in a great location close to St Stephen’s Green. The hotel is all you’d expect from a Hilton. Efficient and friendly check in, large well appointed rooms with the addition of a coffee machine. The only thing missing for me was the lack of a stocked mini bar. Only 2 bottles of water were in the one in my room. ",4,2018,04,25
209,Wonderfull stay,We arrived for my friends birthday and the staff couldnt have been more helpful and friendly from checking us into the room to singing happy birthday at dinner. The receptionist who checked us in (male) cant remember his name but very nice and helpfull with everything.,5,2018,04,24
209,A very good comfortable hotel with amazing staff!,"We decided to spend our wedding anniversary in Dublin and checked out quite a few places before settling on Hilton Conrad. On paper reviews it seemed in the perfect location and would offer us a special place to celebrate. It never failed us from check in to check out. We had room 121 which came with its own balcony, perfect in the sunshine. The hospitality from of all the staff we encountered made us feel like special Conrad guests. The room and bathroom were immaculate and very clean with all mod cons, including Nespresso coffee machine! The bed lined crisp and fresh and towels fresh and fluffy. The food and drink offerings were also amazing.  I highly recommend this hotel for everything and looking forward to returning.",5,2018,04,23
209,Nice hotel but kinda out of the way,"Visited Dublin for a week and stayed at the Conrad Dublin.  Overall great hotel with clean rooms and big bathrooms (which is rare in Europe).  Front desk was very knowledgeable and provided great service.

Beds wasn't comfortable as I developed some back pain after my 4th or 5th day.  I was about to check out so I didn't say anything - so I didn't count that against them.  Location was an issue for me - not enough sites and restaurants close by.  All the ""sites"" such as Temple Bar, Trinity College, and Grafton Street are all a 15-20 min walk.  Hotel is on the southeast tip of Saint Stephen's Green Park.  It's a nice park, but closes at around 7pm each day.  Walking back to the hotel at night can be a bit scary because there isn't a lot of people around.  Never felt I was unsafe, but just wanted to point it out.",4,2018,04,22
209,Great location,"I stayed here for one night recently and had an overall average experience, but not great. The room I had was very warm and upon turning the thermostat down as far as could (16C), the room remained warm all night. Upon checking out, I told them about the room and they said it was because of the heat wave and the winter setting that it can't go below 20C. Which makes no sense but I told them my coworkers were able to make their room chilly. 

The other very odd thing was that the water in the tub/shower was extremely hot, as in burning hot, and no matter what I couldn't turn it down by turning the dial in either direction. I was actually unable to have a shower - first time that has ever happened.

Service average, breakfast average, just a great location.",3,2018,04,22
209,Incredible Hotel in Dublin Close to all the Action,"This hotel was great! It was a great value, but the hotel was nothing short of 5 stars. Everything was spotless, and the staff was absolutely incredible. The turn down service with chocolates and quiet music was a great touch. I will be staying here every time I am in Dublin!",5,2018,04,17
209,Fav room so far,"Room: Very big and unique/modern style with green decorations, seems renovated. King size bed and work desk, small Couch and big bathroom. Newflatscreen TV available. 

Reception: very friendly, separaten hhonors desk to sit down. Welcome drink and room upgrade available for hilton members. No invoice issue.

Breakfast: bit limited options but high quality is offered. Small buffet. Good service. 

Restaurant: same place as the breakfast. We had dinner there and the good was so so good, the price was very affordable!! 

Location: walking distance 5-10 minutes from the shopping centres and main attractions. Nice and big park near the hotel. 

We have had a perfect stay and would always choose the Conrad if we come back to Dublin. Cheers ",5,2018,04,17
209,Excellent night away,"From checking in with Jack to the best poached eggs I've ever had out, this hotel is 5 stars! Would highly recommend and would stay again. Wonderful facilities and we got a lovely view of the national concert hall from our room.",5,2018,04,16
209,The Quality Matched the Expense,"I stayed in The Conrad with a group of friends and was delighted with the quality of the rooms and facilities. 
I only used the restaurant for breakfast where the service was excellent and the quality of the food was outstanding. 

It was an expensive stay but thoroughly enjoyable.",5,2018,04,14
209,Disapointing,"We paid extra to have breakfast at the restaurant on the Saturday morning, but this was closed when we arrived just a row of empty plates. We asked if they could be replaced and 15 minutes later nothing had changed.

Our room overlooked another office complex and it was nothing special. We expected a swimming pool however they do not have one.

It is close to the business district and 20 minutes walk to the city centre,",2,2018,04,13
209,Relaxing and in a great location,Great attention to detail on every level.  The staff was pleasant so helpful.  The pub downstairs was delicious and a great place to hang out and enjoy Irish whisky.  Breakfast was delicious as well.  Our room was beautiful and the bed was so comfortable.  The location was perfect for walking around Dublin.  Highly recommend.,5,2018,04,11
209,Fantastic family Easter Weekend,Fantastic hotel with a true Irish welcome. Outstanding staff and breakfast and Brasserie were extremely good quality. Rooms were great with plenty of space and good quality bed linen. Very spacious bathroom. A lovely family weekend. I would definitely return to this hotel next time we visit Dublin.,5,2018,04,10
209,Best Vacation Ever,"The Conrad Hotel was the first impression of the wonderful experience of what a 5+ star hotel is like.... heavenly. Very friendly , extremely helpful staff . Off the charts with exemplary hospitality !",5,2018,04,08
209,First Class accommodations in a very convenient location,"The hotel is top notch.  The staff goes out of their way to help, the rooms are large, bright, clean, and the most comfortable bed! Bathroom amenities are superior also.
The location was perfect for our needs.",5,2018,04,07
209,Fantastic stay,This hotel is beauitful and the staff are very helpful. We really enjoyed our stay and nothing was too much to ask for. From late night room service to a fantastic breakfast. We will certainly be back!,5,2018,04,07
209,Great service and beautiful hotel,"Stunning hotel with Great customer service especially at the breakfast time. Liam, the Guest Relation Manager, went above and beyond! It occurred a misunderstanding at check out which he sorted it out making my friends and i feel even more appreciated. Professional and friendly, definitively an asset to the Conrad.",4,2018,04,04
209,Best of place to stay in Dublin!,"Awesome place to stay. Easy walking distance to the park, shopping and pubs. Also close to Guiness, Jameson and trinity college. The hotel has a wonderful breakfast, a formal bar and a pub downstairs. The people are very friendly and go out of their way to assist with recommendations and reservations. Take Liam’s walking tour to get an idea of the area before going out on your own. The staff is also easy on the eyes. ",5,2018,04,02
209,Luxury hotel in great location,"The Conrad Dublin is absolutely beautiful and the staff are so welcoming and gracious. My room had a view of the National Concert Hall which was spectacular. The breakfast buffet had many choices and omelets, pancakes, French toast, etc. could be ordered.  Although the hotel was completely full, there were plenty of staff to attend to any need. Fitness room is well outfitted. ",5,2018,04,02
209,Luxury hotel with a personal touch,"We were given a very friendly welcome from Manuel in reception and the helpfulness of all the staff continued throughout our stay at this luxurious hotel. The room was wonderful and food was excellent from breakfast to dinner. All of the staff in the restaurant were very helpful, in particular Yana. There is also access to an Alfie Byrne bar on the lower ground floor for pub-style food and drinks. The hotel is in an excellent location and well connected with an Airlink bus stop right outside and is walking distance of St. Stephen's Green, Grafton Street, Trinity College and Temple Bar. The only thing wrong with our stay at The Conrad was that it wasn't long enough! ",5,2018,04,01
209,Great as always!,"The hotel looks great, I love the renovation. As always the check in staff were so nice and helpful. The comfiest beds ever. And a delicious breakfast - go for the pancakes! The location of the hotel is so convenient. ",5,2018,04,01
209,An Exceptional World Class Hotel,"The Conrad Dublin is an exceptional value for a luxury hotel. All aspect of a typical stay, doormen, front desk, housekeeping, room service and food and beverage operations stand out for their attention to detail.  You will want to come back!!",5,2018,04,01
209,Great front desk and concierge service,"My wife and I spent 6 days in Dublin recently and stayed at this hotel.  From our first arrival we were treated as a VIP.  The front desk staff was outstanding and the concierge service, particularly David, was outstanding with restaurant recommendations and suggestions for sight seeing.  The only downside is that one evening after a long day of touring (15 hrs) we came back to the hotel and wanted to grad a bite to eat as it was late and we didn’t feel like we could go out since most Dublin establishments stop serving food around 9 or 9:30.  We were told that the hotel “fine dining” restaurant served food until 11.  We were happy to hear that and went straight there.  Once seated we were given menus and the waitress indicated she would be right back. After 20 minutes I asked a waitress waiting on a table next to us if she could take our drink order as well as our food since it was evident that our waitress wasn’t coming “fight” back!  She was apologetic and took our orders and indicated that they (staff) were very busy with room service orders.  After she took ours orders we never saw her again.  Our original waitress delivered our drinks and then some time later our food arrived.  Normally I could understand poor service and courtesy if the place was overrun with customers but this was not the case.  There were 8 other people in the restaurant along with us.  Would not commend the Coberg Brasserie to anyone going to Dublin, but would highly recommend the hotel.",4,2018,03,30
209,Another spectacular Irish visit in the books,"Had the opportunity to visit Dublin during the St Patrick’s week celebrations, and selected the Conrad as our base of operations,and what a key choice it was. Felt almost like we were staying at home or with family. From Liam O’hannrahan, the Guest services manager, to Dave, Jim and Gary in Concierge and Guest services, the team was amazing. No detail was overlooked, and all issues were addressed COMPLETELY to our satisfaction. This was especially critical as our return flight on Aer Lingus was cancelled, without one mention of accommodation for the 4 days till we could get a seat back to NY. The Conrad team took care of us to the nth degree, even assuring us our pending room rate increase was dismissed. Do not miss Steve’s cocktail creation genius at work in the lounge, and for a rousing good time, the Alfie Byrnes pub downstairs cannot be beat.

We would stay with the Conrad team again, any time!!

Thanks All

Bob and Mary Ellen Myers",5,2018,03,27
209,Perfect stay,"Arrived on a snowy Sunday afternoon after being delayed at the airport for 3 hours, what a lovely welcome the lady who was on reception was very helpful and friendly. 
We checked into our beautiful clean and well presented room, the bed and pillows were so comfortable it was like sleeping on a cloud! 
Afternoon tea was absolutely perfect nice selection of sandwiches, scones and cakes, we opted for Irish breakfast tea, nice to see tea leaves.
Meal in the coburgs restaurant was nice, and breakfast was great with a super selection for everybody. 
St Stevens park is literally minutes away and was so pretty.  
City centre is just through the park about 10-15 minute walk.",5,2018,03,26
209,business hotel with excellent heating system,"I stayed here for the business part of my trip to Dublin and the hotel was gorgeous. I was perfectly happy with everything except the heat situation. I was constantly too warm everywhere I went in this hotel from my room to the pub downstairs. This is a somewhat minor thing, as the rest of it was lovely.",4,2018,03,26
209,It's ok but not for the price,"It's a good hotel but not quite 5 star yet.
The service is good and high quality. Hotel couldn't arrange pickup from the airport. Rooms are OK beds are super comfy whit good pillows. Bathrooms are bad because of the bathtub/shower combination. Can't stand up straight and shower. 
It's a good hotel but not for the high price. ",3,2018,03,25
209,"Great hotel, central location","A lovely and comfortable hotel across the street from the National Concert Hall and a short walk to St. Stephen's Green. Great food, friendly and accommodating staff, and a lovely ""hidden"" park behind the Concert Hall.",5,2018,03,23
209,Great Stay,"Close to everything. Loved the hotel and room was comfortable with great pillows and bed, Very comfortable. Kemal was great at the front desk. Always willing to share information on whats going on and very informative and very helpful. Karl at the hotel lobby bar was amazing. He was great with the drinks and always was please to keep us entertained. ",5,2018,03,23
209,Great location an easy walking distance to all you need,The Conrad is an excellent hotel and the location made it very easy to get to everything you would need ... a short 10 minute through Saint Stephens Green walk gets you to restaurants and all the amenities you need. Staff was fantastic.,5,2018,03,22
209,Lobby Bar ,"We stayed at Conrad for 7 nights and had to great at the lobby bar. Best way to decompress, loved the atmosphere and the people around. Drinks were amazing and tried my firs Irish coffee and Baileys coffee thanks to Karl aka Cheech !!!! He was awesome had a great pleasure, watched a rugy game and talked about the city and what’s happening. ",5,2018,03,21
209,Wonderful Hotel,"Conrad brand lives up to its name, wonderful facility, beautifully decorated with large spacious rooms. The staff is very attentive, and very helpful. Breakfast is very nice, the lounge bar on the first floor very welcoming. Walking distance to most of the major attractions and sites, if they are further away take the hop on hop off buses to head every where else.",5,2018,03,20
209,We really enjoyed this hotel,"The staff was wonderful, I left my medicine on plane and reception came to my room to help me make phone calls.  The rooms are good sized and pretty. The hotel is in a great location, I would def. recommended this one!",5,2018,03,18
209,A great stay downtown Dublin,"I spent a few weeks at the Conrad Dublin for business purpose.

It is very well located downtown and close to many key spots in Dublin (eg. 10min walking distance to core shopping and restaurants area).

Rooms are modern, bright, and rather spacious. They are also perfectly adapted for long hours spent working on a computer. And beds are just perfect.

At breakfast, the food is very good and diversified, and the staff quickly gets to know your habits to provide a customised service.

A gym is available but too bad there are no spa/pool facilities in the hotel.

In any case, the Conrad is definitely a place I’ll be happy to visit again.

Special thanks to Harry (Sales), Ivana and Jack (Duty manager/Reception), and Thomas (Coburg) for their warm welcome, availability and overall outstanding client services.",5,2018,03,18
209,Lack of flexibility,"I recently stayed at Conrad Dublin as a business traveler. I was originally booked for stay Mon-Thurs but due to last minute changes, I required my travel to be modified.  Our assistant notified the hotel of arrival Tuesday late Monday. Upon arrival Tuesday, i was charged for the day before due to late notification which is normally understood. However, I advised if they can make an exception as we had a group of 5+ other team members residing at the hotel for almost a week. In addition, I advised that I would extend my stay an extra night as well. The front desk advised the policy does not allow and are limited by a ""tough Sales team."" 

Additionally, our team utilized the facilities at the hotel for the entire week including restaurants, lounge, etc.  A the end of the week, we requested a room for 1 hour to gather.  They requested a payment for this.

As a Hilton Honors members, a previous traveler at Conrad, multiple team members attending the event, some flexibility and thought should be taken for each circumstances with great thought.  It's unfortunate Conrad cannot understand the larger picture of customer experience and where recurring revenue can easily occur.",3,2018,03,17
209,Preferred hotel in Dublin,"I love this hotel, have stayed there a couple of times. I have also tried other hotels in Dublin but this one stands head and shoulders above due to quality of room, breakfast and gym. Its hard to not like 1 thing about this property. Keep it up.",5,2018,03,16
209,Well located top class Property,"Have had reason to stay in the Conrad recently , very impressed with the welcome , the attitude of the staff and the on site car park , a rarity among Dublin city hotels .. have not used the bar / restaurant both both look ok ..   the rooms are fantastic , well appointed , comfortable . noise free      ",5,2018,03,13
209,Excellent from start to finish,"This was the first time in many years that we had stayed in the Conrad. It has had a superb facelift and very welcoming. The staff were excellent - welcoming and friendly. 
We were offered an upgrade to one of their rooms with a high ceiling and balcony - again faultless. The bed was very comfortable!!!
Breakfast in the Coburg was to the same high standard and this experience has ensured that we will be back!!",5,2018,03,11
209,"Very pleased. Great hotel, great location","Completely renovated a few years ago. The room was very clean, comfortable and I was able to work quite easily. Free WiFi. Room service was good. Food was average. Service was excellent. All of the staff was very friendly. I was there in a very big weekend. Mothers day and the Irish Rugby team played and won the World Championship. The room was quiet and I slept well considering all of the celebrating! I would stay there again in a heartbeat. I usually stay at the Fitzwilliam. I now prefer the Conrad :)",5,2018,03,11
209,Good rooms - average breakfast,"Rooms were nice. Location is also good. 

Inclusive breakfast offered little in terms of hot vegan options. Staff were nice and helpful but the roast (in oil) potatoes and stir fried vegetables were a pretty average option.",3,2018,03,11
209,Wonderful service. Perfect location for exploring Dublin on foot,"Stayed with my partner for her birthday. Was able to get in touch with their guest services manager via email who was very helpful in arranging restaurant reservations & personalised touches for our stay. Diamond status acknowledged at check-in and received a wonderful upgrade which was very much appreciated. Bathroom amenities were Shanghai tang but also ordered Refinery ones (recommended) via housekeeping. Breakfast in Coburg Brasserie (included as status benefit) was an excellent buffet along with a la carte options, we also had an impressive lunch there inc crab cocktail and pan fried sea trout, reasonably priced too. Staff were excellent, particularly the lady who checked us in and the good humoured porters. The hotel is just off Stephen's Green & short stroll from Grafton Street. Blue bus to the airport less than 2mins round the corner. A superb stay, we would go back in a heartbeat. ",5,2018,03,10
209,faultless hotel,"We booked  a break in Dublin for my husband's birthday treat, as we are Hilton honors members we booked the Conrad, how pleased we were that we did. from booking to checking out our stay was faultless. we upgraded to a suite at a very reasonable cost when we arrived and it was gorgeous, the bed comfortable, the bathroom, vast! the lady who looked after the room could not have been more attentive to our needs, she spotted what we liked e.g. a particular colour of Nespresso pod and they were doubled up on and more thoughtful touches. after we got back from our first afternoon exploration of Dublin, we found a plate with four heavenly chocolates and Happy 66th piped in chocolate on the plate, a really nice thought.
The staff were all super friendly and went out of their way to help us, the breakfast was super, the buffet selection very generous and the waiting staff, very attentive, we didn't have to wait for a thing, the breakfast pancakes were the best I have ever eaten. at the end of our stay, we both agreed that when we come to Dublin again, we won't even think about staying anywhere else, we had such a lovely stay.",5,2018,03,08
209,Lovely hotel,"Third time I’ve stayed here. While it has a slight business feel, it is very nice with some very lovely finishes. Had three meals in the restaurant. Beautiful space, and the food was very good. All the hotel staff was exceptionally good. Location is great as well. You can walk to many of Dublin’s best places. ",5,2018,03,07
209,Always great!,We have stayed at this hotel for the past 12 years and  it is always a pleasure. Love the breakfast and how quiet the accommodations are. Love walking across the Green. The staff are always accommodating. Recommend it always!,5,2018,03,04
209,Great hotel,"All staff very friendly and knowledgeable. Great restaurant, lounge and pub in the hotel. Location very convenient to sightseeing in Dublin. Nice rooms with turndown service in the evening. Breakfast came with our room and was wonderful. ",5,2018,03,04
209,Shelter in The Storm,"OMG Conrad took us in when Storm Emma so passionately met The Beast from The East. Could we have found better accommodations from the 5 Star everything to the 5 Star everything, I sincerely think not. I have stayed in various 5 star rated hotels unfortunately for them Conrad has pushed the bar up a bit higher. The Staff was professional yet bubbly wearing giant smiles that can only be a reflection of the Management that steers this magnificent ship of a hotel. If me bag was a wee bit bigger I would of taken them all back to California. I leave you with the attached picture that says a thousand words.""It's how they serve the honey at breakfast"" how sweet this hotel was.",5,2018,03,04
209,Stunning! ,My friends and I visited Dublin for a long weekend away for my birthday. We couldn't of been more happy we had chosen to stay at this hotel. From the moment we arrived the staff particularly the door men were more than helpful getting to know us and telling us about the surroundings helping us with the best places to go. The rooms were immaculate and the girls had even arranged for a little birthday surprise for when I entered my room done by the hotel. We ate at the restaurant the first night we were there and the food was absolutely amazing. We could not recommend eating there enough. The same with the breakfast we had. Really was beautiful. I will most definitely be returning to Dublin very soon and be staying at the Conrad. Worth every penny. Cannot thank you all enough! ,5,2018,03,04
209,Good but for some improvement for a 5star,"Stayed at the hotel a week ago during a busy rugby weekend.  Having stayed at the hotel previously pre the renovations we were keen to see how it compares to previous stays.

We arrived at the hotel early, having driven down from NI.  Part of the benefits of the hotel is that it offers valet parking (for a 20euro cost).  However, having arrived outside and waited for a few minutes there was no one to take the car or bring the luggage in.  Something you would expect from a 5star hotel.  

At the check-in desk I had to ask for this.  

Noting that we were early we were advised that our room wasn’t ready which was fine.  Our luggage was put in storage and off we went about our business.  The hotel is located 2mins from St Stephen Green and for us this was extremely convenient. The renovations have been great and the interiors is lavish and much more in line with other Conrad’s.

We arrived back at 4pm, we went to get our rooms keys to be advised that our room had a maintenance issue.  The girl apologised and asked us did we want to see another room.  She brought us up to the room which we looked at it and said it was fine. We were then told our bags would be sent up.   Which duly they were.  

As a frequent traveller and a diamond member.  I noted that we weren’t advised of the services, WiFi access, breakfast etc.  Or if their was Lounge.  After a while, I then phoned down and the services were explained.   I was advised that they didn’t have a lounge and some drinks vouchers would be sent up.

I noted that the toiletry selection was limited and certainly not the same selection as you get in other Conrad hotels.  The shower is in the bath with curtain.  Which I personally don’t like.

Later on, we went down to the bar for a drink.  The bar was busy and service was a tad slow.  I also noted that the drinks vouchers were for beer, wine or soft drinks only.  Which isn’t helpful if you don’t like beer or wine. Later on when we popped in for a night cap.  It was still busy and we felt that our glasses were sticky to hold.

The bedroom was clean, fresh and comfortable.  However, the major issue for me was the fact that the air con could not be turned off which I hadn’t noticed till late in the evening.  But we chosen to leave it.  It was set to a comfortable 25 degrees on of low setting.  I woke at 5am only to find the temp was at 16 degrees and at the high setting.  The room was freezing cold.  Given the time and the fact my partner was still sleeping I didn’t want to phone reception for an engineer or to move rooms.

At breakfast, the selection was plentiful and service exceptional.  There was a lady with blonde hair in a black uniform who was tremendous.  There were no name badges so I didn’t get her name.

At checkout, I wasn’t asked how was your stay? Hence my feedback.  

Overall, there is room for improvement.  I’m unsure if I would stay again.  I used points for this stay and do feel it was wasted.  But the hotel is lovely and if these issues hadn’t happen I’m sure it would have been a five star review.

",3,2018,03,03
209,Better than the rest,"Food is really great, gym much better than your normal gym and staff friendly.  I got upgraded to a suite overlooking the National Concert Hall which was very nice, no idea on the other rooms.  I’d say this is on a par with the Westbury, maybe just behind the Shelbourne because of the leisure facilities there.
",5,2018,03,03
209,Great base,This hotel is just off St Stephen's green and is ideally suited for visitors to Dublin.We arrived at 10 am and were checked straight into our room.The breakfasts/room service was excellent.The staff were extra friendly.Will stay here again.,4,2018,02,27
209,Shopping trip ,"I stayed at the Conrad with my daughter for one night last weekend as we were in Dublin to do some shopping. The staff were very professional but friendly, welcoming and helpful. Our room was very comfortable and quiet. Breakfast was excellent and the lounge was very lively in the evening when we returned to the hotel after eating out, and there was a wide selection of drinks. The location was very handy for shopping and restaurants. I would definitely stay here again next time I’m visiting Dublin. ",5,2018,02,26
209,Staff the best we have experienced in Dublin,"We have stayed in several five star hotels in Dublin over rugby weekends over the years but this was our first time at the Conrad. Booked through a BA holiday we got great value. Location is superb, housekeeping outstanding detail, staff brilliant and we feel well rested after 3 days in Dublin.  We would certainly stay here again. 

So why only 4 stars.  Really it is a 4.5 but I can’t give it 5 vs others we have visited.  The hotel itself is fresh from its refurb... however upon check in we were allocated a room overlooking the building works at the back. This we did not fancy and were fortunate enough to check in early enough to change rooms away from this.  The toiletries for a 5 star hotel were very disappointing, no shower gel, entry level shampoo etc. We tend not to bring these things with us when we travel to keep luggage down relying upon the hotel rating to hope we will be ok. So these were a shame. 

The breakfast was also a let down vs other hotels we have stayed in. The hot buffet was cold.... but a wonderful lady plated us up a hot one fresh from the kitchen.  I didn’t get her name (no badges on most of staff so hard to compliment where due) but she was excellent. We ate breakfast out 2/3 mornings as a result (do try Hatch& sons across the green.  Delicious) 

Staff were as previously mentioned generally first rate. We really loved Lemuels bar as a place to end the day and Steve and Mark were spot on. Fantastic cocktails, great craic and they smoothly dealt with some of the more ‘merry’ guests. It is a far better bar than the Fitzwilliam or the intercontinental and probably the reason why we would return. Good luck to them with the Hilton Absolut cocktail competition- we had a try of the entry and it was very refreshing. Worth noting that the in room hotel directory makes no mention of the new bar, no menu for it and these guides need updated to reflect the newly refurbished spaces. 

Bed very comfy and as also mentioned housekeeping was also first rate.  The concierge gents very helpful and courteous and we felt it a very friendly home for us in Dublin. 

Am sure next time it will warrant a 5 but in the meantime thanks to all the team.  Next stop Belfast.... ",4,2018,02,25
209,Over rated,"Really not much more to say, Loud bar noises at night, level of service has deteriorated significantly over the past years. Rooms are in need of renovations. Location is good however, right in the city centre. Seriously over priced !!",2,2018,02,25
209,Wonderful from start to finish,"Visited for one night with friends and this hotel was fantastic from start to finish. The staff are wonderfully attentive, the bars great with late night service until 4am which we took full advantage of. 

The bed was immensely comfortable and the room quiet at night, unfortunately the construction work outside of my room in the morning put paid to a long lie-in, but it was a Friday, I’m sure it would be fine at weekends. 

Breakfast was very tasty and lunch was equally good. The staff couldn’t do enough for us and were attentive but not excessive in their appearance. 

This was an excellent trip and the Conrad was central to this enjoyment. Cannot recommend highly enough. ",5,2018,02,25
209,Nice place to stay in Dublin,"My husband and I stayed at the Conrad on our visit to Dublin. We arrived very early after our flight from JFK and the room was not yet ready, however, we went into the restaurant for tea and some breakfast and the front desk staff found us there to let us know that the room was ready as soon as we were. We considered this to be really great service. The hotel is a bit of a walk to many of the attractions in Dublin, however, the walk is a nice stroll through a nearby park with ponds and lovely trees. We appreciated not being right in the noisiest part of Dublin. The food at the restaurants was very good, particularly the breakfast although sometimes the service was a little slow. Our room was comfortable, if a little small. The toilet did not always flush properly, which was frustrating, however, we found this to be true in several places in Ireland. We would certainly stay at this hotel again.",4,2018,02,21
209,Fab stay at Conrad in Dublin,"We stayed last weekend for 2 nights at the Conrad Hotel in Dublin. We had a lovely stay, staff were all great, room was nice and clean and breakfast was lovely. 10 min walk to the shops and 15 mins walk to Temple bar. We will be back! ",5,2018,02,19
209,Very nice hotel,The staff was very friendly and helpful and the hotel is centrally located. You can walk to the center in about 15 minutes. The Front Desk prepared a special breakfast to take away on the last day as we did not have time to have breakfast in the restaurant. Special thanks also to Manuel from the Front Desk who was very helpful and made our stay perfect.,5,2018,02,19
209,Superb hotel,"We stayed here last night
As we were both arriving early to the hotel I had asked for an early check in which was accomplished 
The room was very spacious and spotless clean.
The bath was a bonus as my back was playing up and helped a lot.
On booking I had said we were both celebrating birthdays so it was a nice surprise to get chocolates and wine sent to our room.
Breakfast was self service and if I had any criticism was that the room is a bit cramped for the amount of people there.
However the food was very tasty
Overall the staff were very friendly 
Check in and out was seamless and would definitely stay here again as location is excellent as within walking distance of the city Centre ",5,2018,02,18
209,Extra little touches!,"Lovely stay, made better by the extra little touches provided by the staff.

In no particular order, fresh milk delivered to the room on request, valet parking at no extra cost, free parking pass to get out any time the last day, free overnight shoe clean.

Just some of the little aspects provided by the staff that made this a 5 star stay !",5,2018,02,18
209,Birthday weekend ,"Had my birthday at the Conrad. Room was wonderful...staff really friendly and the cooked breakfast was to die for. The whole hotel has a lovely warm atmosphere. Dinner was really good, the crab starter in particular.",5,2018,02,18
209,"In general good, but has room for improvements. Lacks attention to details","I travel very frequently to Dublin and my preferred hotel is The Merrion.  This time and because of the location of a business meeting, the Conrad was more convenient, and decided to stay here at try it.

In general very good impression
Good room, spacious, spotless clean, very nice bed, good shower, a nice desk with all sorts of power sockets (what is very convenient), so in general, the room and equipment was very good and efficient

In terms of food, I had a drink at the pub and breakfast in the restaurant, and all was satisfactory.  Staff at breakfast and in general in the hotel, is very nice, excellent manners and a very client and guest oriented attitude.  

However, there are some areas which were not up to my expectations for a hotel which seems to be ""top 10"" in Dublin

Air Contidioning - impossible to turn it off. I don´t like to sleep with air conditioning, and tried in all possible ways to turn it off, and was impossible.  There are no instructions in the room, and after touching all the buttons I gave up and went to bed....was too late to call ´for help (11:30PM). 

TV: didn´t work. I assume that the remote control needed new batteries....after the frustated attempt to turn the AC off, once in bed tried to watch some TV and unfortunately wasn´t able to

Internet: very bad and unreliable connection quality.  Impossible to stay connected for 30 minutes without an interruption on the signal. I mention this in other reviews of Hilton properties.....in general, the internect conection quality is very poor.

HHonors : I´m a member, asked to have my membership number added in my booking, but for some reason, my points were not credited. Need to investigate what happened

As said, a good hotel, but with a huge potenital to improve if staff pays more attention to the small details which make a difference in a stay.",4,2018,02,17
209,Great service and location,"Our company is a global technology company who has booked our annual company kick-off at this hotel.   My one word summary of the Conrad:  AMAZING!    The location, the service, the food and beverage- and ambiance are all top class.    Thank you for your focus on customer experience.  I look forward to my next stay.   
",5,2018,02,12
209,Exceptional client service,Absolutely outstanding service. I rang ahead to the hotel a few days before our trip and mentioned that I was planning to propose. We were given a complimentary room upgrade and the bedroom was decorated with flower petals and towels in the shape of swans and a heart on our arrival. She of course said yes! Special thanks to Kemal Puljic for arranging it for us. Top class service and would highly recommend the Conrad to anyone visiting Dublin.,5,2018,02,12
209,Best rooms in Dublin,"The Conrad is the nicest hotel I've stayed in in Dublin, the rooms are so spacious, comfortable and well equipped with every amenity. The bathroom with its massive tub is also particularly nice! Personally I found the decor to be stylish and classy throughout the hotel.

Staff were excellent, have booked already to come back again!",5,2018,02,09
209,Hotel that makes you feel Good,"Conrad Dublin is a hotel that makes you feel at home every day of the week. When you walk in you meet either Jim or Gary that make you feel at home. when you check in it's Manuel,Kemel,and Julia. The rest of the hotel is equally as great, in the breakfast it's Thomas and his staff which provide a wonderful start of the day. I chanced a stop at the Lemuels Bar and was introduced to Steve Tighe a new member to your staff who blew my socks off with his knowledge of the whole bar.and also very personable. Mark the bartender was a great addition to his staff and made me feel like a family member. 
Thank you for letting me stay at your wonderful hotel and looking forward to a return visit.",5,2018,02,07
209,Would not stay anywhere else  !,"We loved everything about the Conrad Dublin.  The location is perfect to walk anywhere but the hotel is in a quiet area. There were great restaurants within a few blocks and our favorite pub O'Donoghues was right down the street. 
Check in and check out were both great and the people working the front desk would greet us every time we walked in or out.  The room was lovely with a comfortable bed a nice bathroom.  Everyone we met who worked at the hotel could not have been nicer.  There were friendly servers in both of the bars and breakfast area.  Toni in particular stands out for getting us coffee to go one morning.  Besides the wonderful people that work there,  the other thing that stands out about this hotel is how quiet it feels.  We did not hear any noise inside our room at any point in our stay.  It was so peaceful and relaxing !!  
I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2018,02,07
209,A great banker hotel if staying in dublin,The Conrad is an excellent safe bet if staying in a Dublin. Not the best location about 20 minute walk to the action but a pleasant walk. This hotel is not edgy in any way very traditional and they have tried to think of everything. One of the first hotels we have stayed in for example where all the technology works eg docking station for music if the iPhone etc etc . Lovely room without being exciting but no great views out of the windows we had a building site. Breakfast exceptional an example of where they had covered all the options. Overall service was outstanding. We were just staying in Dublin on night on our way to the USA the next morning for our purpose the Conrad was perfect.,4,2018,02,05
209,Beautiful hotel ,"I will start off by saying the one negative thing that forced me to deduct two stars. Our heater did not work in our room so we struggled early morning trying to stay warm. (As you know how inconvenient it is to switch rooms at 4am). The next morning upon departure I notified the front desk to which we did not receive an apology. I have reached out through my Hilton honors support and have yet to hear back from this property. (One star lost on room quality, one star lost for customer service)

Now that the bad is out of the way I can tell you how fantastic this property is. Charming, warm, and modern the first three words that come to my mind. The room was lovely, and the lobby bar was magnificent. The morning we left had our complimentary breakfast. (Offered for gold members) and we let the server know we were in a little rush and she did her absolute best preparing us a to go meal and coffee it was outstanding. Unfortunately I didn’t snag any photos of the room. Regretting that now. ",3,2018,02,04
209,Exceptional hotel,"I travel extensively for work and have to say this is one of the most pleasant hotels that I’ve had the pleasure of staying in.  Large, airy and well appointed room with everything you need and more!!

Amazing breakfast!! ",5,2018,02,03
209,Beautiful ,"Lovely hotel in a great Dublin location, just a few mins from St Stephens Green and Grafton Street. Foyer is beautiful, as is the bar area (with amazing cocktails) but in the height of Christmas it was very quiet with not much atmosphere so unfortunately after a few drinks we left for other bars in the city centre. Rooms were beautiful, great size and so cosy, loved staying here, especially as staff were so friendly. Only fault was the breakfast ordered to the room, dry and tasteless, we took one bite each and left it, not expected for a hotel like this. Will definitely stay again but won't be ordering breakfast!! ",4,2018,02,02
209,Very relaxing weekend ,"Great time helpful staff.  Central location great for shopping, eating out and sight seeing.  Very handy parking on site.  Big bonus for Dublin City centre. 
Lemuel’s bar friendly. Great cocktails- can recommend Dublin daisy ",5,2018,02,02
209,Outstanding Service and Location,Lovely hotel with spacious rooms and exquisite furnishings. Attentive care! Special shoutout to Liam who went above and beyond and offered wonderful insight into making the most of our time in Dublin.,5,2018,02,01
209,"Nice hotel, excelent stay","Rooms were good, bed was comfortable. While hotel was full, it was quiet in the room. Cafe on the ground floor offers excellent food all day - truffle fries are highly recommended. Will stay there again when next in Dublin.",5,2018,01,30
209,Excellent property to stay at!,"The Conrad Dublin is a wonderful property! I stayed here for a week long business trip. It is centrally located to both the business area as well as many tourist hot spots. The hospitality at the Conrad is top notch - best customer service I have experience at a large hotel. The stay included their breakfast which is an amazing array of food options for everyone including traditionalists, vegetarians, vegans, and those who like different options in the morning. Extremely filling! The dining room offers a delicious lunch and dinner menu, and the bar has some exceptional mixed drinks available. The rooms are well kept, cleaned twice daily (if you have evening turn down service).  Minibar, Nespresso coffee and hot chocolate refreshed daily. Beds are amazingly comfortable, and the rooms have a nice table/desk that has the built in power strip. It was nice to have several USB plug ins built into the outlets and desk as well as an EU plug and US plug option in the desk.  The concierge desk was also extremely helpful suggesting and making dinner reservations as well as making sure our early morning cab was ready to take us to the airport. They have pretty much thought of everything a business traveler needs in this property. I was very impressed, and would highly recommend this property to business travelers as well a tourists visiting Dublin.",5,2018,01,29
209,"Guest comfort and needs are put above everything else, truly 5 star.","This an odd review but bear with me as it speaks to the quality of staffing and desire to do their very best for guests. They are to be very highly recommended.

I booked a twin room at The Conrad for my mother's birthday. As it transpired she has a disability that made the room booked inappropriate for her needs during the stay.
The Conrad is very disability friendly but hers is a complicated mobility need which requires both separate beds and a walk in shower for her comfort.
The guest services manager Liam worked very hard to try any number of ways to address her needs once we had uncovered a difficulty. He was warm, responsive, endlessly helpful and supportive.
In the end, due to the nature of her needs, I felt we were unable to make the stay work. Liam then helped to work together to find a solution at that point. He truly was focussed on the needs of the guest.

I was blown away by his focus on making the stay enjoyable prior to our attending and on his dedication to getting it right
If staying at The Conrad matches the quality of the dedication and professionalism shown by its staff - it is truly a 5 star hotel in every way. I would recommend it to anyone.

This time spent by Liam allowed us to make the right decision for a disabled guest not simply the right decision for the hotel. Well done The Conrad and our thanks to Liam.",5,2018,01,29
209,What a great hotel,"I stayed here last weekend and had a wonderful stay.  The hotel is really nice, clean and of a high standard.  I arrived at 8:25am and asked to leave my bag there for the day. By 8:30am I was settled in my room.   Very happy!
Later than evening whilst chatting to the staff, I was told I should have had an upgraded room.  5 mins later I was settled in a huge room.
The bar staff were really nice and friendly.  They had a large party in that night and stayed very professional though-out the evening, even with a lot of pressure!
A really nice touch was the handing out of umbrellas as it was raining outside.

This was just a simple one night away trip to see some friends but the hotel really impressed me.

Thanks to all at the Conrad Dublin!",5,2018,01,27
209,Luxurious Hotel,"By far the best hotel I have stayed in, in Dublin and their breakfast is definitely the best I have ever experienced. The rooms exhume luxury, from the bedding to the turn down service each evening. Would highly recommend, do not think you would be disappointed.",5,2018,01,27
209,Best Hotel in Dublin,"Have stayed here several times with my parents and other family members. 
Location is perfect, food is incredible and staff are very pleasant and friendly  
Price wise it is a bit expensive but its worth it",5,2018,01,25
209,"Great service, wonderful stay","We just completed a stay at the Conrad, and it was outstanding. The service was impeccable; attentive, friendly, comfortable. Breakfasts were excellent. The pub downstairs had excellent food and was a nice place to relax. The location is perfect; very close to St. Stephen's Green, walking distance to most of Dublin's major sights. The rooms were comfortable and very clean; daily service was excellent. Overall, this is a great place to call home while visiting Dublin. A+!!",5,2018,01,22
209,Best hotel in dublin,Excellent in every respect all the staff most friendly and go out of their way to make your stay most enjoyable in every  way if you have a choice to make this is the best and well worth the money spent ,5,2018,01,22
209,Relaxed stay,Myself and wife and daughter came to stay here and we had a good nights stay here. We had a king junior suite which was good and the staff were very helpful and was an all round good stay as I travel round the globe and stay at a lot of hotels and this was pretty good. Thoroughly enjoyed it ,5,2018,01,22
209,Brilliant,Amazing hotel with brilliant staff who couldn't have been more helpful. Will definitely be back. Excellent location right on St Stephens green. Breakfast was also very good at the hotel. When we arrived our room wasn't ready and the staff arranged us free tea and coffee until the room was ready.,5,2018,01,22
209,A wonderful home away from home !,"Just across from the National Concert Hall, a few steps from St Stephen's Green, and subsequently at walking distance from everything in the city centre, Conrad Dublin ticks all the boxes with full marks : location, obviously, but also rooms (a special mention for bedding), food (breakfast is unbelievable), service (top-notch staff).  The only downside : leaving such a wonderful place proves to be extremely difficult...",5,2018,01,22
209,Excellent business hotel,"The hotel is located about 30-45 minutes drive from the airport. The room was well equipped, well decorated and modern, though a little on the small side. Service throughout was efficient and friendly. The restaurant served excellent food but the acoustics and layout were not conducive to a quiet business dinner.  The breakfast offered a splendid buffet with the option of an a la carte menu. If I stayed again I would choose a larger room.
The bar served a large number of draught beers but surprisingly and disappointedly not Guinness!",4,2018,01,22
209,The brilliant Conrad Dublin,Outstanding hotel. Best trained staff I’ve seen in years. Great ambiance. Fantastic breakfast. We just loved it. The location is excellent - I think the location makes Dublin very accessible. The Restaurants around are terrific - try Rustic Stone. ,5,2018,01,21
209,Wonderful service,"Great, modern style hotel located on the far side of St Stephen's Green (opposite side from Grafton St shopping, drinking/dining areas, and Trinity College).  It's a short walk across the park to become proximate to many places of interest. What really makes this hotel special is the staff.  Everyone went out of their way to make us feel welcome.  While  we did visit the Merrion and the Shelbourne for cocktails (both are fantastic) and loved the ambiance, we would return to the Conrad based upon how wonderful the team was there.",4,2018,01,21
209,Great location and very clean,All the standard amenities in the room - very good size tv and nice view of the area.  Location and parking is fantastic - just a short walk to St Stephen's Green and 20€ for parking for the day.  Got a late check out at 1pm and left car at hotel for rest of day (no extra charge) while we went sight seeing. The breakfast was excellent in terms of the quality and presentation.  I was particularly impressed with the honey - it looked as if it came straight from the hive and was delicious.  The service in terms of offering extra tea or coffee could be a little better but I could not fault the food. Just one small niggle was the unexpected deposit of 50€ for possible extras - it should have been communicated at booking not on arrival. Hence the 4 not 5 mark.,4,2018,01,20
209,Most pleasant,"Experienced a delightful 5 night stay at the Conrad, Dublin. Hotel is fairly close to most attractions but in a quiet area. The rooms were comfortable, and staff were very pleasant, helpful and accommodating. Breakfast was great. Would definitely consider staying again.",4,2018,01,19
209,"PERFECT spot, fabulous service, outstanding staff","I've probably been to this hotel a half dozen times in the last seventeen years (beginning with my honeymoon in 2002). The surroundings are always excellent. You couldn't ask for a more attentive staff or a better location (just a block or so from St Stephen's Green, within walking distance of restaurants, shops, Trinity College and anything else you'd want in Dublin).
I remember having a small hiccup here (nothing major) about 10 years ago, and having it IMMEDIATELY resolved to my satisfaction. As a shot in the dark, I reached out to the gentleman who was the GM back then, and to my pleasure, found out that he is still here. That suggests continuity of service and a superior product.
Over 20 years a Diamond, and this is at the top of my list of favorite HH hotels. Try it, you won't be disappointed.",5,2018,01,18
209,Weekend break,"Really enjoyed our latest stay in the Conrad. The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly, as usual. Our room was beautifully decorated and had everything we needed, including an espresso machine, fridge, iron and ironing board and hair dryer. There was a huge flatscreen tv and a radio alarm equipped with iPhone dock and also a desk equipped with USB port. The bed was huge and very comfortable. Breakfast was amazing, with a great selection of breads, cakes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, cold meats and cheese and the usual cooked foods which make up the usual Irish breakfast. The hotel is very convenient to St Stephen’s Green and the shops of Grafton St., and now also the Luas, although we didn’t use the latter. We enjoyed room service one night and had beautiful steaks in the restaurant on another night. Will definitely be back.",5,2018,01,17
209,Excellent stay ,We stayed in the Conrad on the 13th of January. We had some issue with booking intially but Julie was very helpful and understanding in sorting out our stay. When we arrived to the Conrad on Saturday the staff were very welcoming . We had just got engaged that day and the employees in the Conrad made what was a special day even more perfect. I would especially like to thank Liam for his hospitality and kindness. Thank you and we will be back again.,5,2018,01,17
209,Great location,"The hotel has been refurbished from the last time I stayed and it looks really well, although I did miss the silver teapots at breakfast which have been replace with modern porcelain.

I love the Conrad for it's location, it's a short walk to the Grafton Street.

Rooms are nicely decorated with slippers and dressing gowns provided along with umbrellas. The baths are huge and are probably my favourite part of staying at the hotel, I love being able to have a soak in a big deep bath.  However it was not to be this time as the water pressure was so poor I had been running the water to fill the bath for over 30mins and it had just about covered the bottom so I had to abandon the bath and have a shower.  

Breakfast was good with the usual selection, they had a small gluten free section with bread, muffins and cereal.  The waitress toasted the gluten free bread in the kitchen under the grill. Be aware of the bacon, as seems to be the norm now in hotels they had a slice of bread at the bottom to soak up the grease unfortunately this means it is unsuitable for me as a coeliac to eat as it has been contaminated with gluten and would make me sick. It took a bit of explaining to the waitress as to why I couldn't eat the bacon from the buffet but we got there in the end and a slice cooked in the kitchen was provided.

We had dinner in the hotel later that evening and it was delicious.  We ordered 2 expresso martinis to finish off the meal but unfortunately they were so strong we couldn't drink them and we are both strong coffee drinkers.  The waitress kindly deducted them from the bill.

The bar was extremely busy but we managed to find a table and ordered a few drinks, all were very good and it was the perfect way to finish off our stay.",5,2018,01,17
209,Family stay for Concert at NCH in Conrad,"Wonderful stay in Conrad, friendly and welcoming staff, we had dinner and breakfast.  The newly renovated hotel is a great improvement and much more sociable place to enjoy good friends and family.   Only issue is piped music in restaurant and foyer is very distracting, too loud and choice of modern jazz not great.   I suggested to hotel to change this maybe to classical or traditional irish music at a lower volume so it doesn't interrupt your dining or social experience.",4,2018,01,17
209,Best Hotel in Ireland 😎,"This is the only hotel you should stay in when in Dublin. The service is amazing, especially Gary who works the front desk. Went out of his way to make sure my family the came to meet me for dinner at the Conrad felt welcome and brought them to the restaurant to find me. The service staff for breakfast do an amazing job in making sure the guests have everything they need. The rooms are spotless and styled to perfection. This is the only hotel in Ireland that goes above and beyond for their guests. ",5,2018,01,16
209,Best stay in Dublin,"Honestly the best stay in Dublin. I have stayed in many hotels in Dublin yet I always go back to the Conrad. Staff are amazing, beds are so comfy, food is great and cocktails are even better. Thank you Conrad for making our stay special every time. It was our anniversary and the Team made it so special from the roses and swans in the room to the special delivery of chocolates in the evening. Couldn’t have spend it any other way. ",5,2018,01,15
209,Awesome service and staff,"The Conrad Dublin staff are the best!  From pre-trip advice to the great service while at the hotel, everyone was polite and attentive to all our questions.  Fabulous hotel and would highly recommend to anyone going to Dublin.  Centrally located to everything!",5,2018,01,13
209,Almost perfect stay,"This hotel  has undergone a referb since our last visit and what a good improvement. Check in and check out was friendly and efficient. The rooms have been done up to a very high standard and the decor was very pleasing..The downside was we could hear the resident in the next room at 3.30am very loudly on his phone. This problem needs to be addressed as everything else in the room was very good. Bed was huge and very comfortable.
Breakfast was fabulous with a lovely juice to greet us with. The selection of ingredients were excellent and I particularly liked that they were all locally sourced. Big tick as well as the large cafeterie of coffee to get me going
A more peaceful night and this would have been absolutely perfect",4,2018,01,13
209,So good I'm going back,"Recently stayed.  It was absolutely fabulous.  The hotel  has thought of every little detail. Down to usb sockets and international plug sockets. 

Comfortable big beds to die for and impeccable service. 

Go and enjoy every minute ",5,2018,01,13
209,Conrad Dublin understand customer service.,"With an exceptionally beautiful lobby and restaurant/bar area, the Conrad Dublin's elegance is only exceeded by their well-trained staff who performed beyond our expectations with their professionalism, courtesy and service.",5,2018,01,12
209,Superbh Hotel,"I am a frequent visitor to Dublin and consider this to be a great hotel. I have used it for bot business and  personal trips. The staff are really friendly and helpful, service levels are excellent and the accommodations have been recently refurbished and are really great.  ",5,2018,01,09
209,Dublin Conrad Was Awesome!!,"The Conrad staff and service was amazing.  From the doormen to the waitstaff, they were always willing to help and serve.  The Breakfast spread was a highlight for my family as well...  Amazing!  I look forward to another trip and wish my stay was longer!",5,2018,01,09
209,Another excellent stay,"4th time staying at the Conrad Dublin in the last year. Great location, really comfortable good sized rooms. Breakfast excellent, plenty of choice for all tastes. Staff from check in to bar and restaurant all very professional, helpful and friendly. Would recommend and will be staying here again when in Dublin. ",5,2018,01,09
209,One of the best stays,From check in to check out every single staff was friendly and willing to accommodate your needs.   The hotel is not close to main downtown area it was an easy walking distance.   Great overall experience. ,5,2018,01,09
209,Perfect!,"Our stay at the lovely Conrad Dublin was wonderful. Check-in and check-out were very smooth and the reception staff were very willing to help with any questions or service requests we had. The hotel location is perfect for walking to St. Stephen’s Green, Grafton Street, and nearby restaurants. We also easily walked to the Teeling Distillery in the Liberties district. Our junior suite was spacious and well-appointed. A beautifully decorated Christmas tree in the bedroom was a wonderful surprise when we checked in on 30 December. Breakfast was delicious  with a wide variety of items from which to choose. Service in the mornings was prompt, welcoming and friendly. The lounge was a good place for tea in the afternoon or a drink after dinner, but service was slower there. There is a nice fitness facility in the hotel. We loved our stay at the Conrad and would love to stay here again the next time we come to Dublin. ",5,2018,01,08
209,"Very comfortable, very American","I stayed at the Conrad 12 years ago and remember  it as being a nice property. I checked TripAdvisor before I booked it again to make sure it had maintained its standards. There were parts of the hotel room that might have needed a slight facelift but I wouldn’t have noticed if I hadn’t known what it as like 12 years ago. People at the front desk were great. If you are an American looking for the comforts of home, you will enjoy the Conrad.",5,2018,01,04
209,Great service and good location ,"I really enjoyed the stay in Conrad hotel. It is very nice inside and has everything for you comfort stay. The staff is attentive and very friendly. Rooms are clean with nice cosy beds. Breakfast is delicious. The brassiere also suggests good value. There is only one slight minus that you can hear your neighbours in the room. However, the service and facilities are amazing. I would definitely recommend the hotel to friends. ",5,2018,01,04
209,Could have been better,"During my second stay, the expectations set after the first stay were not met. Again, as a Gold HHonors Members, we've received an upgrade, that was all fine. Despite the even more luxury room (a 1-bedroom suite), the Junior Suite during our first stay was nicer. 

The nice experience we had with the staff during our first stay was only partially repeated. The house keeping, reception and bar staff were all very friendly. Just the breakfast experience was a horrible one. First of all were we placed in some temporary space next to the main restaurant. Options in this ""extra space"" were very limited. When asking if we could take place in the main restaurant, the answer of the host was that the main restaurant was fully occupied. When actually walking into the restaurant, it was half-empty. We were not offered a menu to order from when entering the breakfast room. The idea of a staff member lying in your face and not have been given the option to order any additional food options, is appalling for a 5*-hotel.",4,2018,01,04
209,Dublin’s Best! ,"The Conrad Dublin is a luxury hotel located at the finest area of Dublin. Absolutely amazing! The staff are well-trained, they anticipate what you may need before you even ask for it. For me, this is what truly defines a 5-star experience. 

The lavish breakfast spread will warm your heart in the cold rainy morning, they have the most delicious hot chocolate, ever. The gym is equipped with everything a traveler needs to stay fit. The concierge, above all, will go the extra mile to get you reservations, information, and all the little details you can think of to explore the city at its best. 

Beautiful interior, the beds and pillows are the softest. A friendly warning, you’ll find it rather difficult to leave the bedroom! 

In-room dining is rather affordable. For a property like the Conrad, and a city like Dublin, you’d expect an overpriced menu, with all honesty, I was impressed at how they keep it real and friendly. So spoil yourself, indulge en-suite and spend more time with with your special someone, a staycation sounds about right. 

Oh and they make the most amazing French onion soup! It’s the little things really, the chocolates from housekeeping, that familiar feeling you get from the butlers, bell men and waiters. 

The truth is, It didn’t feel like a hotel at all, it was like coming home.

I’ve been to quite a few Conrad properties, so allow me to say this, the warmth through the service I experienced from the staff at Conrad Dublin is by far the best among all. 

I highly recommend, 5 stars in all aspects.

Only the best,
Mr. Raven ",5,2018,01,04
209,Pleasant central hotel for sightseeing!,I stayed here with my fiancee as she had booled this trip for my birthday. We did not use many of the hotel's facilities as we were too busy taking in what Dublin had to offer. I will say the staff were extremely attentive and helpful. The room was clean. The hotel is perfectly located to take in the sights of Dublin. It is also located closely to the air link bus stop. ,4,2018,01,03
209,Great staff in a warm hotel,"Just got back from a one night stay in the Conrad, Dublin. 

Great reception staff, were very welcoming.
Had a complimentary early check in and breakfast to take away as we were leaving early for a flight. 

The room was lovely with great facilities. I would certainly stay here again. ",5,2018,01,03
209,A wonderful Christmas in Dublin,"My wife and I spent our Christmas vacation in Dublin. It's important to find a nice place to stay because for Christmas Day, Dublin is closed. Fortunately, the Conrad was able to take care of us with a nice Christmas dinner and some nice amenities, including mince pies and even non-alcoholic mulled wine. (Which I assumed was mulled apple juice,..) The room was well-appointed and very comfortable. The staff was always eager to help.

The best part, and somewhat unexpected, was finding out that our room came with breakfast. And this was no scone and cold cuts. This was a feast. It usually meant we didn't have to eat lunch!

The hotel is near St. Stephen's Green and is a short walk to Grafton Street. Very nice location.",5,2018,01,01
209,Lovely Hotel.,Perfect if you are going to the National Concert Hall. Staff very professional and friendly. Food just ok. Room comfortable but a couch would have been nice as only one desk chair to sit on. Not comfortable. ,4,2018,01,01
209,Absolutely Fabulous!,"Our stay at the Conrad Hilton in Dublin could not have been any better. Beautiful room, delicious breakfast and dinner. Located in the heart of the city we were able to walk everywhere. 

The service was impeccable and the hotel was spotless! 

I highly recommend this Conrad.",5,2018,01,01
209,Fabulous Hotel,"This is an outstanding hotel. The rooms are spacious and gorgeous, the staff are very accommodating, and the restaurant is wonderful. Loved this place, and I would highly recommend it!!  We will be back for sure next time we’re in Dublin!!",5,2018,01,01
209,Excellent hotel,"Tied stay here with some shopping. Top class hotel, great breakfast, great cocktails, comfy room, great bed, only disappointment was shower pressure way too low, didn’t try dinner here but will next time round",5,2017,12,31
209,Excellent in every way !!!!,We spent a most enjoyable overnight at Conrad and really enjoyed every aspect of the hotel. It has recently been refurbished in the bar and restaurant and this compliments the overall experience. The staff were most welcoming on arrival and assisted the car parking and check in. Breakfast was plentiful and varied with great attention from the staff. Excellent location and value and only to be recommended. ,5,2017,12,30
209,Wonderful Vacation Hotel,Hotel staff provided Impeccable service and attention to detail. Convienently located property to all major points of interest in Dublin. Highly recommend staying at the Conrad for both business and leisure travel. ,5,2017,12,30
209,Christmas in Dublin,"Coming home to Dublin for Christmas we picked the Conrad for it’s central location. All rooms and public areas have recently been refurbished and the hotel was beautifully decorated for the season. 
Service and food were top notch, warm and friendly staff meant nothing was too much trouble.",5,2017,12,30
209,Pleasant stay,"The Conrad's lobby was nicely decorated for holiday season and with modern furniture. 
Our room was remodeled, trendy, luxury and clean. The king size bed was a true king not two beds pushed together. Very comfortable bed and linens. Our room had an issue with heat however staff was able to fix the problem.

We enjoyed the downstairs bar for snacks and beers. We highly recommend their afternoon tea. It was very creative from the baked goods to the alcoholic drinks to the presentation of food. We enjoyed the tea presentation as well! Must do.

The breakfast was excellent. Many vegetarian options and diverse menu of food. The ambiance of the dinning room is well decorated and just lovely.

Location of the hotel is perfect. Right off the park. Away from hustle bustle of Temple bar yet walkable to temple bar area. 

The staff was mostly all friendly and willing to accommodate us for a pleasant stay.",5,2017,12,28
209,Faultless,"Stayed for 2 nights in December to celebrate an anniversary.  I contacted hotel before our arrival as had read some recent comments on Trip Advisor about noise/heating issues.  Not only were we allocated a very quiet room, but we were given a complimentary upgrade and some home made chocolates for our celebration.  The room was not huge, but really well appointed, with a super comfy bed.  Bathroom was good, with full size bath and overhead shower.  Breakfast was very good.  Lots of choice, with excellent presentation and service was faultless.  Only quibble was the fact that a lot of items on the A la Carte Menu were an additional cost.  What made our stay 5 star was the quality of the service throughout.  Front desk were super helpful and I got a couple of texts to check that everything was OK.  The location of hotel is perfect - very quiet and safe but a short walk to shops and museums.  That's the main reason we picked hotel initially and I would definitely use again if travelling to Dublin.",5,2017,12,28
209,The most wonderful hotel experience of all-time,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this hotel. It was the highlight of our trip to Europe in July and its sister hotel in London could certainly learn a lot from the staff.

From the delectable welcome plate of macarons to the advice about the hop on/hop off tours and restaurants, it was an incredible experience. We only wished we could have stayed for more than the two days we were in town.

The breakfast was not just outstanding, but was a sight to behold: from the french press delivered to our table every morning to the incredible array of food to the actual honeycomb in the buffet area to use for our tea. I have Hilton Honors gold status and though an upgraded room wasn't available at the time, I felt every bit the gold guest. 

I would recommend this hotel 1000 times out of 1000 and hope to return for a much longer stay sometime in the future.",5,2017,12,23
209,Bar Food Basement Conrad Hotel,Excellent steak sandwich and very well presented. Great service and very pleasant staff. Will be back again in 2018. Hotel has been revamped and is very inviting to stay or eat in the many restuarants.  Well done great Hotel in the heart of Dublin's city South Side of Earlsfort Terrace.,5,2017,12,22
209,Christmas party!,"Recently had our Christmas party in the Conrad and it was an exceptional night from start to finish!

The staff were extremely competent, professional and friendly. The food was delicious and the bar service was quick and pain free!

Would definitely return to the Conrad for an overnight stay! ",5,2017,12,22
209,Very disappointed,"Usually I don't like to complain, however I was extremely disappointed with my stay in the Conrad this year.  It just wasn't value for money whatsoever.

My staff Christmas party has been in this hotel for the past 3 years and this is my third time staying at the hotel. Even the dinner served at the party was very scabby half a carrot, a tiny circle of potato and a small piece of roast beef for the main.

Last year I got a beautiful room with breakfast included and an incredible experience staying in this hotel which made me justify paying extra this year if I could get a similar experience.

However, this year I got a fairly regular room, nothing special with no breakfast included and I was so disappointed.  I had been looking forward to my stay here for months because of last year. I treated myself to this as a Birthday & Christmas gift to myself as I'm turning 30 at the end of this year. It was also really loud in the room, I could hear people in the corridor, banging outside, someone typing on a laptop in the room next door and people walking above me.  I was afraid to use any of the amenities in the room such as the coffee machine for fear of an extra charge being slapped on.  The painting, wallpaper and tiling wasn't even nicely finished and the blinds were a bit dirty of course I'm nitpicking on these details as it was fueled by my disappointment and annoyance.

I wasn't going to say anything in relation to this, but I just felt...ripped off.  When I was checking out, the girl behind the desk asked me how my stay was and I felt I couldn't leave without being honest.  

I told the girl how disappointed I was, in fairness she validated my €40 parking ticket...yes...€40 extra to park your car in a squashed underground car park and the girl told me a manager would be in touch with me in relation to how disappointed I was, but I never heard anything.

I forked out €560 (which would of been €600 if I'd paid for parking) to stay in a fairly normal room for two nights with no breakfast.

I found this a complete disappointment and I doubt I'll ever stay here again, not value for money whatsoever.",2,2017,12,20
209,Wonderful Stay!,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Conrad Hotel on 17/12/17 and we were impressed from the second we stepped through the front door. Beautiful hotel with very welcoming and friendly staff. Breakfast the next morning was fantastic, very good variety of good quality dishes to choose from. The location of the hotel is perfect for shopping, dining and general exploring of Dublin. We will defiantly be back again soon! ",5,2017,12,19
209,They Have Thought Of Everything,"We booked for one night but had to stay an extra night because of the snow. They were fully booked but accommodated us and we were allowed to keep the same room. The bedroom we were in was sumptuous. Beautiful large bed with quality bed linen, slippers, robes, hot cocolate etc., Your every need is catered for in the room. They even supply you with a shoe bag! The breakfast was delicious. Everything  spotless. I normally  stay in the Shelbourne in Dublin and would never consider going elsewhere but they are just too expensive for what they offer now so tried for a different hotel for a change. I'm very glad I did and this  will be my first port of call from now on. 

One gripe is that we asked concierge to book a table in the restaurant. He confidently  told us it was fully booked for the whole evening. He didn't bother to check.  I asked him to ask them to put us on a cancellation list but he didn't bother... because after being out for the day we went directly to the restaurant and were offered a table st a time to suit us. When we were there the restaurant was half empty. 
So my tip is just book directly with the restaurant. ",5,2017,12,18
209,Very Nice Stay,We Stayed on occasion of Our Joint Birthday Celebration.  Hotel is Very Well Located and Our Room was  Very Nice and Bed was Extremely Comfortable.  Would certainly recommend and Will Definitely Stay again.,5,2017,12,17
209,Nice hotel but misses the mark!,I accompanied my husband on a business trip and was excited to stay at the Conrad.  We stayed there 5 years ago and it has since been renovated.  Our room was clean and attractive to look at but the furniture was terribly uncomfortable and the desk impossible to work at with no good place to put your feet when sitting at the low and uncomfortable bench.  Bed was hard.  It was cold and hard to regulate the temperature in the room and the constant noise of construction right outside our room made it impossible to get over jet lag.  Breakfast was good despite the fact I never received the omelet I ordered 3 days in a row...there was always something missing - cheese or onion or peppers.  The servers were very friendly but maybe they should write down what you ask for!?  The coffee was good but slow coming out. Wifi was great!,3,2017,12,14
209,disapointed,"I am a Hilton member and on this trip i was using points, that is why i was left at the end of the line. 

The receptionist was nice however no chance of an upgrade as they were ""full"". The air conditioning was poor and i could not get it to warm the room and it was cold all night. I don’t expect noisy cold air con in a hotel. 

Room service was slow and I had to call x 2. The hotel bar was so busy i decided to avoid. 

Breakfast poor and the staff could not cope, i had only coffee and they asked me to pay!
.
Overall, very poor and certainly not value for my earned points. Parking for my rental was expensive.",1,2017,12,13
209,birthday treat,"Thank you for looking after us so well, superb from start to finish, a very happy birthday girl. The welcome as always from the front of house to the bfst room never changes, it is always extremely warm and professional soThank you , we will be definitely be back for the pancakes!",5,2017,12,13
209,Fantastic,I came here at the beginning of December with my boyfriend. The Conrad were very welcoming on our arrival and couldn’t do enough for us. Can’t fault our room it was clean and bed was very comfy. We had bed and breakfast and had breakfast both mornings we were there which was nice as well. Definitely recommend. ,5,2017,12,12
209,First Time but will return,"Have spent a fair amount of time in Dublin hotels this year but hadn't been booked in here before. Definitely my favourite of those tried.
Well appointed, comfortable room. Very friendly staff, particularly those at breakfast.
Very nice breakfast on both mornings.",4,2017,12,08
209,Well Located Business Hotel,Limited nice hotel options in central Dublin and Conrad is well located and decent hotel adjacent to St Stephens Green. Breakfast buffet not as good as the Radison Blu on Golden Lane but much nicer location,4,2017,12,06
209,Lovely stay,"Had a lovely experience here. Went for an Ireland match in the Aviva. Got a taxi out as was in heels but could have walked. Central to Stephens Green/Grafton Street.

Lovely bar here 
Breakfast was lovely 
Staff were all very nice
Room was spacious & everyplace spotless

Would deff recommend and will be back",4,2017,12,06
209,Pleasant one night stay in Conrad Dublin,"Stayed here for one night before flying back home. Check in from Ivana was quick and efficient and she was super friendly. Upgraded to a deluxe room as a HH diamond -  very much appreciated. Room was nice and very clean. A bit cold though, seemed like the AC didn’t work with full power but nothing to complain about as the bed was super comfy.
Hotel location perfect. All within walking distance. Still easy to find with a rental car - although sat nav recommended as dublin has many one way streets. Velvet parking was also very quick and fair value for EUR 20 in a capital city. 
Breakfast was really nice and the waiters very quick and attentive. especially that you get your own coffee pot is nice and not the average coffee from a can. Breakfast selection is not as big as in other hotels but you can see they are serving a very high quality. Excellent! Of course depending in personal preferences but nowadays quality above quantity is key. 
Well done Conrad Dublin. Highly recommendable and we will be back - next time for a longer stay hopefully! ",5,2017,12,06
209,Not what I expected,Expected so much more from a Conrad.  Disappointing.  Not a great location.  Long walk to restaurants.  Breakfast was great!  Noisy traffic sounds.  Bar food bland.  Rooms very ordinary.  WiFi sketchy.  Would not stay here on a return visit.,3,2017,12,05
209,Excellent stay,"Very good service in all fields. Cooperative, attentive and pleasant staff. Enthusiastic welcomes. Excellent dining and pub. Could stand to have pizza available in dining room before 9 pm. Great breakfasts. ",5,2017,12,04
209,Weekend stay in Dublin at the Conrad,"Fantastic hotel, great location and very attentive front of house staff, we ate in the hotel restaurant and have to say it was the best steak I have had for a long time, only negative was the service which was very slow as it wasn't that busy was disappointing, apart from that it was excellent. Also the car park was extremely convenient with a lift straight to the car, would definitely stay here again.",4,2017,12,04
209,Gift voucher,I have now tried 3 times to buy a gift voucher for this hotel twice by phone and once via email to address I was given.I cannot see why it is so hard to sell someone a voucher I have bought many over the years in other hotels and was always sorted on the first phone call. It seems that there has been a lack of staff training on this issue or poor customer service is to be expected in the hotel.This was to be a Christmas gift but now I'm not sure if this would be a good buy that is of course if anyone in the Conrad wants to sell me a voucher.,1,2017,12,04
209,Excellent hotel,"Thouroughly enjoy stay at hotel. All staff were very nice, helpful and professional. Room very comfortable. Enjoyed the nespresso coffee in room. Food very good. Best breakfast i probably ever had in a hotel. ",5,2017,12,03
209,Perfect hotel,"My wife and I stayed for a weekend at the hotel. Everything was great. Speedy check in. The concierge was very helpful. The room was nice, clean and the WiFi worked very well. Very kind staff. The breakfast was superb. The location is good, walking distance from the center. I can recommend the hotel to whoever visits Dublin.",5,2017,12,03
209,5star at it's best,"Amazing hotel with all the trimmings 
The staff are fantastic and so attentive it's unbelievable 
Mentioned that it was our anniversary and they sent chocolates and a card to the room with congratulations on it
The hotel is beautiful and the luxury speaks for its self 
Great for a night in Dublin 
Thanks to all 
",5,2017,12,03
209,Weekend break,"This is a class hotel in great location. We have stayed there a good few times . 
Staff are excellent and more than courteous. There is a nice bar and also a gym if needed. The breakfast is very good with great variety ",5,2017,12,03
209,Afternoon yea,"Went for Christmas afternoon tea today. Excellent selection of herbal teas. Sandwiches were delicious and fresh, cakes adorable and tasty. Lovely tableware, very sweet staff & attentive service. The cocktail lounge where tea was served is very nice & cosy, and want too packed in with people. Clean and comfortable. ",5,2017,12,03
209,Not what it says on the tin,"Booked two days, maintenance outside the rooms on the 6th floor, the noise was so bad, the heating was not working correctly either.

Complained several times to only fall on deaf ears.

Also had to get the card key reprogrammed several
Times, the price of the room did not refect it’s quality. 

Stayed here back in 1991 whist on tour with the Bee Gees, I was wouldn’t have thought it was the same hotel as it was so bad.",2,2017,11,29
209,Amazing hotel - highly recommend!,"The hotel was beautifully decorated throughout all the communal areas (the Christmas decorations gave it an extra magical touch!) and the room was lovely. Bed was comfortable but pillows were a little soft - though that's personal preference. We were travelling for my boyfriend's birthday and the hotel gave us a complimentary upgrade which was very much appreciated. The staff were super friendly and helpful, and the location was in close walking distance to St Stephen's Green, Grafton Street and other points of interest. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,11,29
209,Above and Beyond during our Honeymoon,"I'm a bit slow to review, but wanted to be sure I did. My husband and I honeymooned to Ireland and started our journey staying here for a few nights. They had made the room special for us with a personalized dessert and greeting card upon arrival. We also were always asking the front desk agents for tips on great restaurants and pubs to experience a more local and authentic experience in Dublin. They were always willing to point us in the right direction and even made sure we had a map to walk there correctly. The breakfast each morning was the best of any Hilton we've stayed in, and the property is conveniently located.",5,2017,11,28
209,Conrad Dublin,Best service I have ever received from any hotel I have ever stayed. The staff was incredible personable and helpful. I was contacted personally by the hotel before my arrival and every day asking if I needed anything. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to travel to Dublin. It is also in close proximity to everything and a nice and short walking distance through the park to the shops. Fresh towels and water was brought to the room every night. I also ran into Nelly in the lobby and got a picture with him before his concert that night.,5,2017,11,28
209,Conrad Dublin is Un-Faultable!,"My stay at Conrad dublin was a 5 star experience. It was my first time in Ireland after many many years of dreaming of a visit I was not left disapointed. 
It has a wonderful location very close to the main attractions we were a few minutes walk from grafton st and also extremely close to a beautiful park (sorry I dont Remember the name but im sure someone in the hotel will know) 
Beautiful lobby area and quick check in. special mention to John from reception a wonderful polite man who was beyond helpful! 
We had breakfast inclusive with our room and it was all we could ask for and more. the food was perfect great selection on the buffet for breakfast along with an additional a la carte menu which was prepared on request and was clearly fresh and tasty. I would recommend the french toast. Another special mention to Jodie from the Coburg who gave us great service and nothing was too much trouble for her she really made us feel comfortable and showed us impeccable quick service along with still making time to stop and chat with us and gave us recommendations of things to do in dublin. 
rooms were spacious and comfortable. 
we didnt drink in the bar as there were so many places to try but it was really nicely decorated. 
So i just want to say thank you to the conrad for making my trip to dublin everything i always wanted. Your staff really show the wonderful hospitality the irish are famous for.",5,2017,11,28
209,4th stay at this property,"This was our 5th trip to Ireland and our 4th stay at the Conrad Dublin. This hotel never disappoints. Located across from the National Concert Hall on relatively quiet Earlesfort Terrace, the property is just one block from St. Stephen's Green, and the heart of Dublin's tourist and shopping district. The hotel is extremely nice. Lovely lobby, nice breakfast, ultra comfortable rooms. You will generally pay rather dearly to stay at the Conrad Dublin, but for us, this is one of those indulgences that we will always select.",5,2017,11,28
209,Conrad Dublin is excellent,"This hotel is in a super safe and quiet area although it is a very short walk to fun pubs and the beautiful St Stephens Green Park. The rooms are very nice and clean. The staff are welcoming, helpful and very friendly. This was one of the best Hilton properties I have stayed in and I travel a lot for work. I would definitely stay there again. ",5,2017,11,27
209,Expected more,"Stayed here as a diamond Hilton honours member and as a special treat which was fore-mentioned to the staff upon online check-in. 
There isn’t a spa or executive lounge which is unusual for such a highly respected Conrad. 
A drinks voucher that only entitles you to a house wine or soft drink? Even the DoubleTree branches give a wider selection of drinks with the voucher. 
Nothing about the way the staff treat you or behave makes you feel like a valued customer in their hotel and there was no diamond member welcome as I have experienced in every other hotel I’ve stayed in. 
Not even being able to toast your own bread at breakfast? And then waiting 15/20 minutes for them to give it back to you?

Overall it has been a pretty average stay that I would have expected at any premier inn or travelodge. 

On a positive note, the rooms are very clean and fresh. There was a long black hair wrapped around the shower gel though...
",3,2017,11,25
209,Brilliant stay,I stayed here overnight for business and the hotel exceeded my expectations on all levels.  It was a real pleasure to stay my only complaint was it was only for one night and was a business trip. I will definitely be back with my wife next time - well done Conrad for achieving near perfection!,5,2017,11,22
209,Fantastic hotel ,"My wife and I stayed on the 17th/18th  Nov 
We have stayed in most of the 5 star hotels in Dublin and this is by far the best.Everyone one is so obliging from front desk,doormen,concierge,bar and dining room staff.The rooms Are kept immaculate and lovely decor.
The breakfast is amazing and so 5star the girls are all so friendly and polite in the dining room.We had dinner on the Saturday night and it was delicious.We will definitely be staying here again.",5,2017,11,20
209,Wow! One of the best hotels I’ve stayed in.,"I travel weekly and I am used to staying in a wide range of hotels. I am Hilton Diamond member so was upgraded to a King Premier Room with View. The room was faultless, lots of facilities, mini bar well stocked, robes all the usual but all high quality.

I went to have a light snack in the bar and a couple of drinks the sandwich tasting platter was lovely and surprisingly filling.

Breakfast is the highlight, a wide range of options from the traditional cooked breakfast through to locally sourced produce e.g. yogurts. 

The service throughout was impeccable and I hope to return very soon and a major asset to the Dublin. Highly recommended!",5,2017,11,20
209,Wonderful Dublin,"Dublin, Ireland is a wonderful place to visit.   My daughter lives there now so I will be visiting often.   People are so friendly and so much to see.     We stayed at the Conrad, which was wonderful and close to all the hot spots.   The staff and level of service is a 10.   Definitely a five star property!!",5,2017,11,19
209,Fantastic hotel,"My husband and I stayed for two nights, we could not fault the hotel in any way. We received a warm welcome, our room was spacious and comfortable, with luxury toiletries. En route to dinner we received a text from the hotel enquiring if we were satisfied with our room. We mentioned that the room felt a little cold. On our return later that night a heater had been placed in the room & it was very cosy. Breakfast was delicious with a huge selection, and plenty of staff at busy periods. A very enjoyable stay, we hope to return in the near future.",5,2017,11,19
209,The Finest Hotel in Dublin,"From the moment you enter the stylish Conrad hotel you are greeted by the exceptional members of staff .Every staff member deserves a mention but I would have to write a book . Jim & Tony will take care of you the moment you arrive these gentlemen were outstanding,nothing was a problem we were always greeted with huge smiles and very professional.Then there’s Liam a great guest relations guy Thankyou for all your help ..Lorrenzo checks you in all smiles again .
The rooms are beautiful new beds and linens beautiful new Conrad towels and aramotherapy toiletries.The Hotel I would say has the no 1 cocktail bar in Dublin the bar is very stylish and we had the best champagne cocktails we have ever drunk in beautiful glasses this is a place to be seen and enjoy a very special evening a must .The position of the hotel is perfect you are walking distance to every thing The theatre beautiful St. Stephens Green National gallery and beautiful shopping The hotel has a limousine bmw service contact the Concierge.We stayed 2 nights again I have to say the best hotel breakfast we have eaten beautiful seating areas and service impeccable .The First morning was very special I noticed the general manager Mr John Hegarty speaking to the guests at breakfast asking how there stay was I think this guy runs a unique team in the Conrad Dublin Thankyou Mr Hegarty we cannot wait to return .",5,2017,11,15
209,Exceptional personalized service! The staff remembered my name at every encounter.,"The room, food, service and staff were excellent.  The location is perfect, and the room was extremely comfortable with top class luxury.  I was offered an umbrella when it was raining, offered help with my bags and was never delayed when in a hurry.  I love how this hotel runs.",5,2017,11,15
209,Five Star Hotel with Five Star Service,"I booked the Conrad Hotel through Booking.com and booked two rooms under my name. Our daughter got engaged here on the first evening and I needed to change the name on the booking to her boyfriends name as this was a surprise for her. 
I spoke to the lovely Rachel O'Connor and told her my story about the surprise engagement. 
Immediately she upgraded the room to a large suite overlooking the National Music Hall - just fantastic with a rose petal turn down service and a bottle of white wine that night.
What an introduction to a hotel I have never used before. The staff, from doorman to receptionist (Kemal, thank you for a lovely welcome) to all the waiting staff in the restaurant, just brilliant.
Breakfast was just as fab with a lovely selection of juices, fresh fruits, cereals, smoked Irish salmon, salad plus all the full cooked Irish breakfasts - what more could anyone want.
Fantastic location and so quiet yet right in the heart of the city.
A very special thank you to Rachel for a great stay.",5,2017,11,15
209,Conrad Brilliant,"Stayed at the Conrad again we are regulars just brilliant location and terrific service the staff are wonderful 

Always stay for the rugby weekends and entertain and it never disappoints superb 

From check in to check out just first class ",5,2017,11,15
209,Loved the Conrad!!!,"We couldn't have made a better choice than the Conrad for enjoying Dublin, where we stopped off for a few days of sightseeing after a business trip to Galway. The rooms are spacious, inviting, stylish, modern, and very quiet --without the typical big city traffic noise--and the bedding is exceedingly comfortable.  We slept very well at the Conrad!
We ate breakfast and had a dinner at the hotel and thought the food was excellent--really one of the best restaurants in town. The staff was warm and exceedingly helpful with all our needs--special thanks to delightful Gary for helping us get settled into our room and for walking all the way down the block just to flag us a taxi!
The location is perfect--in a safe neighborhood that is a short walk to shopping, restaurants, parks, and museums.  Don't miss the Aran Sweater Market on Grafton--the quality and selection is great and it beats having to take a ferry over to the Aran Islands.  We bought the sweaters on a Monday and they were delivered for free to our home in the US on Thursday!!!
One of the best perks of staying at the Conrad is that it is right across the street from the National Concert Hall.  We walked over at the last minute and bought tickets to a wonderful performance of Irish music that evening. It was an awesome and unexpected opportunity.
My wife and I have traveled all over the world and thought that the Conrad Dublin was easily one of the best hotels we've been to.  We used our Hilton points for the stay this time, but wouldn't hesitate to be full paying guests the next time we are in town.",5,2017,11,14
209,Conrad in Dublin is Excellent,"Luxury at a fair price.We arrived before dawn, and settled into their comfortable lobby (needs a bit of an update). The staff were generous and warm. They brought us croissants and coffee, and allowed us to check in to our room early.",5,2017,11,13
209,a model for hotel service,"a facility one always hopes for when  selecting a hotel but rarely gets. met and exceeded virtually every expectation. from the doorman at the entrance to the housekeeper on our floor, there was always a smile and a greeting",5,2017,11,12
209,Top notch all the way,"We splurged on a stay at this 5 start property and it will go down as one of our most memorable stays.  From early check-in to check-out, it seemed every staff member was only too happy to go above and beyond in terms of delivering service.  We almost felt a little embarrassed by it.  :)  I wish I had their names to call them all out for helping to make our stay so enjoyable.

We did need to make a room change (I hesitated to make this request), but the response was completely gracious and instant.  Up came a member of the staff who insisted on helping us move our luggage; in my haste, I left jewelry on the table and again, they went to the former room and brought it to me in our new room.  The ""little"" things...

We found the bed and bedding deliciously comfortable.  Good sized bathroom with good lighting.  I did find the step-up into the tub/shower fairly steep and think it could be a challenge for some?  Plenty of hot water, good pressure, excellent toiletries.

Location could be considered a bit out of the way--maybe--but certainly walkable to many major sites.  It does sit right across the street from the National Concert Hall and taxis seemed always at the ready.  Enjoyed an amazing breakfast each morning, ordering from the menu, as well as partaking in items from the very generous buffet--fruits, yogurt, cereals, hot items, juices, honey-in-the-comb.  Service great--all of which contributed to our friends--staying at another property--to join us each day for breakfast! (As Gold Hilton Honors, breakfast included for us.)  First night enjoyed some bar food at Alfie Byrne's.  Friendly staff, good food, good crowd.  

My husband had many, many positive comments re our stay at the Conrad--our first--and hopefully, our first of many.  As he said, ""top notch all the way"".  I agree 100%!",5,2017,11,12
209,Luxury,"It’s a nice hotel for sure, centrally located very close to St. Stephen’s Green.  Easy walk to restaurants and pubs, and sites.  Easy access to public transport.  Very comfortable beds, remarkable really.  Nice tub for a bath and well appointed rooms.  Comfy robes.  The hotel lacks some of the historic gravitas of competitors in this town, but for comfort and convenience, it’s really good.  ",4,2017,11,10
209,Great hotel,"Very nice hotel, comfy beds, friendly staff, nice dining options. I ate at the Pub downstairs , the restaurant, and the bar. All very good. Doors to the rooms are not as modern as the rest of the hotel, a bit strange. ",5,2017,11,09
209,Absolutely amazing!!!,"My husband and I stayed at the Conrad Dublin and it exceeded every one of our expectations. The staff is amazing, the hotel is impeccable, not to mention the bar and restaurant are incredible!!! Highly, highly recommend!!! This is a top notch establishment in every respect. We definitely plan to stay here again!!!",5,2017,11,07
209,Simply fab!,"Amazing hotel, lovely staff! Gorgeous afternoon tea who helped with all our dietary requirements and the breakfast... WOW! 
The room, the hotel, the staff... just perfect and all on such a busy Marathon weekend!
Thank you!",5,2017,11,07
209,Conrad does Conrad,"Fab welcoming hotel from moment you walk in to the moment you leave. Everything you need is there if not, it will be. Staff went out of way to ensure a great stay. Concierge guys were very knowledgeable and friendly....my fav John :) 
All in all a fab second stay at this hotel and would certainly stay again. Thank you.",5,2017,11,06
209,Dublin vacation and marathon experience,"Very welcoming and helpful staff. Morning breakfast was excellent. They went out of their way to deliver a 'runners' breakfast to our room at 5:30am. So accommodating. Room with king bed, fridge, coffee bar and real glass wine/beverage glasses provided was perfect. Nice touch with housecoat and slippers too. ",5,2017,11,06
209,Conrad Dublin,"Hotel was excellent, very centrally located and attention of staff was superior, nothing was too much hassle for them. Breakfast was delicious and a great variety, extra coffee no problem.   Would definitely recommend this hotel",5,2017,11,06
209,Outstanding !!!,"Stayed on a Saturday with my wife and 2 teenage daughters.
From the moment we arrived we felt really welcomed by all the friendly staff. Our room was pristine with all the mod cons you would expect for a 5 star hotel.
We dined in the evening also and again the food and importantly the service was exemplary!
Breakfast until 11am was welcomed also after a late night out in Dublin city.
Location was perfect with just a short stroll to Grafton Street!
Highly recommended 
We will be back !  ",5,2017,11,05
209,Fabulous but the Mattresses,"A lovely hotel, great staff, restaurants and bar of which we tried all. However, what’s with the mattresses???  Hardest matt we have experienced at a high end hotel EVER! Tossed and turned both nights, both of us with sore backs and complaints through the day. Time to upgrade folks, the linen quality should match the luxury of the bed your on. We’ve slept on better in 3 Star hotels....",4,2017,11,05
209,Very nice hotel near St Stephens Green,The hotel was very nice with renovated rooms and very good service. The breakfast was excellent and staff was very attentive. The only restaurant on-site is a brew pub which was good but you need a walk a distance for a nicer meal. The biggest complaint is that we were there for business and spent an afternoon working in the lobby but none of the restaurants had cups or a way to have coffee in the lobby so we needed to make runs to the Starbucks throughout the day and evening which was both surprising and inconvenient. Other than that it was a very nice hotel - have been to nicer Conrad’s in other cities but it was still a hotel I would stay at again.  ,4,2017,11,05
209,Fantastic !!,"My Husband and 3 week old baby spent our first night away as a family together at the Conrad on the 31st of October. 
The staffs attention to detail was amazing. Not only was out room upgraded but we where gifted a bottle of wine with a Congratulations dish for the birth of our little girl.
We had dinner in the restaurant which was also to die for and breakfast the next morning was the best hotel breakfast I have ever had! An amazing selection of foods!
We will definitely be returning to the Conrad again!!
Thanks for an amazing stay !",5,2017,11,02
209,"Memorable luxury hotel in the heart of Dublin, highly recommended","Our two [2] stays, November and December 2016, one [1] night/two [2] days each

In 2015 my fiancé and I had agreed to requalify for the Hilton’s loyalty program Hilton Honors gold status, so in January 2016 we pre-booked stays accordingly to achieve our goal.

We had stayed at the Conrad Dublin before, so this was our second and third stay in November and December 2016 for one night each, which I have combined.

The Conrad had gone through a major renovation and the restaurant and bar received a make-over too.

It was unrecognizable at first. The hotel had finally arrived at the 21st Century.

The interiors are inspired by nearby Iveagh Gardens, so there were flower arrangements and prints.

The chandeliers were inspired by branches of trees.

The Coburg Brasserie, an equestrian themed restaurant which felt modern and inviting and Lemuel’s Bar was inspired by Gulliver’s Travels. We liked both designs and felt well visiting both.

The reception had moved closer to the entrance. There were maps of historical Dublin behind it.

We liked the details, like mirrors with flower frames, the seating areas including a pink sofa, the marble and Art Deco elements.

A ball room was also located on the ground floor.

The business center and meeting rooms, named after rivers in Dublin were on the first floor.

The fitness center with TechnoGym equipment and the pub Alfie Byrne were on the lower ground floor.

Check in was done very efficient and the welcome was warm.

We booked a Deluxe Room and received one on the 6th floor.

When checking at the online application the Deluxe Room chosen for us had already the view (over the National Concert Hall, Earlsfort Terrace and the city) we wanted, so we kept it.

The room was large and the color scheme black, white, green, brown and anthracite. 

There was a small hallway with a wardrobe.

The floor and one wall are wooden, which gave the room a residential feel. It reminded us of our stay at the Sherwood in Taipei.

A sofa was facing the comfortable king sized bed and was located underneath the TV. Obviously watching TV from the sofa wasn’t possible. We enjoyed sitting there for a chat and to have a light meal before our dinner at the Coburg Brasserie.

There was also a carpet.

The bedside lamps were unusual and reminded us about the Burren.

The modern artwork above the bed had us discussing what it was depicting. We came to the conclusion it could be inspired by the stairs of Earlsfort Terrace or it was a river, muscles or an arm.

The handles of our drawers looked like tree trunks or branches.

The writing desk was lacquered with integrated outlets, which were easy accessible, and had an elaborate base. There was a golden designer lamp as well. The desk was facing the room and located in the bay window. 

Watching TV from the writing desk was possible. There were around 40 channels with lots of regional and international ones like Bloomberg, CNN and CNBC. The WIFI worked well at all times in the hotel as far as we remember.

Magazines available were Conrad’s own, the 30th edition Dining in Dublin and Travel Ireland. There was also a jogging map and suggestions by the concierge what you can do, when you have 1, 3 or 5 hours in Dublin.

The mini fridge contained two bottles of complimentary Conrad branded water.

We used the 24 hour in room dining, which was promptly delivered and correct.

The friendly member of staff and I chatted about my Doctor Marten’s boots. He liked them.

Our order included two Connemara cured salmon and one fresh fruit salad with a dollop of fresh cream.

When requesting the meal we were offered tap water too. It was a thoughtful touch, but we had our own drinks, so it was okay.

The presentation was beautiful and the quality of the food very high.

The cost was 38 Euro / ca. 44.30 USD.

There was also an iron and ironing board.

The bathroom was large with a sink, bath tub-shower combination and a toilet. 

My fiancé surprised me by having requested Shanghai Tang bathroom amenities instead of the usual Aroma Therapy Associates via the online concierge. We have clothing from Shanghai Tang and know some of their perfumes, so we knew we would like it.

The water pressure of the shower was good and there were no complaints about temperature changes.

When checking in in December 2016 we had to wait for a bit due to a small queue.

We had booked a Premier Room to find out what the difference was to the Deluxe Room beside the inclusion of two drink vouchers per person according to the website.

At check in we received only one each, so I asked about it and received another set. 

Late checkout at 2 PM was granted without problems.

The room layout and look were identical. Here are some of the differences we noticed.

The refreshment center could be stocked at request with choices of snacks including Keogh’s crisps (2.50 Euro / ca. 2.95 USD), Dormen’s Jelly Beans, wasabi peanuts and chili and lime cashews (5.45 Euro each / ca. 6.40 USD) or Benoit’s Chocolate Factory at 5.95 Euro / ca. 6.95 USD.

The views from the 7th floor were better than the ones from the 6th. While the differences in height sound small on paper in reality the difference was noteworthy as we found out.

The artwork was different too.

The room felt more luxurious due to the loofa, shoe polish equipment and more pillows. 

We had also requested arrival amenities. The strawberries dipped in Valrhona chocolate and a bottle of Acqua Panna were already waiting for us. The strawberries were yummy as expected.

During this stay we had in room dining too. It included a beef burger with Dubliner Vintage Cheddar Cheese, home-made relish and twice cooked chips and a Croque Monsieur with Glen of Arklow baked ham, creamy béchamel sauce and Emmental Cheese on toasted sourdough bread and a fruit salad. The bill was 44 Euro / ca. 51.10 USD.

We used our drinks vouchers at Lemuel’s Bar. It was incredible busy, so we decided to make sure we would get a table by calling from our room to reserve one for later in the day.

In a separate review I will write about breakfast and dinner at Coburg Brasserie.

We would return again, if we are looking for a luxurious stay in the heart of Dublin. The Conrad beside the Morrison, A DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel so far remain in our books the most memorable, stylish and luxurious Hilton options in Dublin, Ireland.

Would we recommend this hotel to a friend? YES!
Would we want to stay with them again in our future? YES!",5,2017,11,01
209,Concert Hotel,"The Conrad is an excellent five star hotel directly opposite The National Concert Hall so it is an excellent place to eat, stay or have a drink at the interval of you are attending a concert! It is also adjacent to the centre of town so a good place to stay if visiting Dublin!",5,2017,11,01
209,The Friendliest Hotel Staff in Dublin,This was our second stay at the Conrad Dublin and we can't say it enough to our friends and family: the friendliness of the staff is always appreciated and makes us feel like we're at home away from home. Our favorite person on the staff was Francisco because he would go above and beyond to help us out but everyone there is fantastic.,5,2017,10,31
209,Excellence in room and service,"Our room met standards you would expect from a Conrad Hotel. We stayed on points, but there was no difference in service or attitude. We enjoyed the banter with the bar tender in the main lounge (not to mention the Irish whiskey) and the first quality breakfast in the dining room. Bravo!",5,2017,10,30
209,Outstanding ,Stayed here for one night on route to a wedding elsewhere. Probably one of the nicest hotels I’ve stayed in. Could not find a fault with anything. Room staff and location excellent. Would definitely go back here. Not cheap but if your thinking of going here you will not be disappointed.👍,5,2017,10,30
209,Recent stay,"My husband & I stayed for 2 nights in October. The location is very good, right by St Stephens Green & about 10 min. walk to Grafton Street.  Newly renovated hotel, with nice ambiance, large rooms, well appointed, great friendly & welcoming staff .  Bar & restaurant had a nice selection of drinks & food.
The reception or concierge called us after our departure, to say that we had left our passport in the safe & they then offered to drop it off to us in Malahide, where we were staying next. Could not ask for better service. 
Great hotel for Corporate travelers as well as leisure.",5,2017,10,29
209,"Awesome hotel, great for conferences","The hotel is very inviting, clean and with a friendly staff. Rooms are nicely layed out and equipped with everything needed for a great stay.
The conference rooms are great and well equipped for all you need.
If you want to pamper yourself, this hotel is very much recommended!",5,2017,10,28
209,Good location,"Great location - but very expensive for what it is and offers.
Breakfast service is very slow, they need to be more attentive, both mornings I was there I had to wait 10min for coffee and additional 15 for two poach eggs.",3,2017,10,27
209,Short stay in Conrad Dublin,"Myself and friend stayed for one night in October 2017 and on arrival we were upgraded to a Premium room on the top floor. We had a very panomaric view. The room was extremely comfortable with a king sized bed and beautiful furnishings. However we could not understand how to use the coffee machine. The location of the hotel is perfect being directly across the road from the National Concert Hall and a very short stroll to St.Stephens Green in the city centre. We had  an evening meal in the room and breakfast in the room also and the food and service was excellent.
We had checked out the menu in the Alfie Byrne pub but it does not appear to be extensive in choices and we thought it was extremely dark there also. Overall I would recommend this hotel.",5,2017,10,27
209,"Was expecting better out of Hilton's top tier brand, but it was a good stay.","Stayed for 4 nights at the Conrad Dublin. They are doing some construction on the hotel, which unfortunately was not clear when booking the property. The rooms were nice, though a bit small, but nothing exceptional. Very comfortable beds here. They have a restaurant at this hotel, but it unfortunately closes quite early. Wi-Fi here was strong throughout the hotel. The room service here was pretty good, though. Staff were very good at this hotel. Any requests we had they were able to fulfill and the door man did a great job in flagging down a taxi when we needed to get one to go someplace.",4,2017,10,24
209,One of the best Hilton Properties,"I am Hilton HHonors Diamond member and exclusively stay at Hilton properties.  I have stayed at a number of them.  I'll admit 60 percent of Hilton properties are duds, but this Conrad Dublin is an absolute GEM!  This is one of THE BEST Hilton properties I have ever stayed at.  The staff, condition of the rooms, amenities, everything was absolutely fabulous.  It's my hope the folks at Hilton will read this review, and use the hotel as a training model for their other hotels as the Conrad is simply fabulous! ",5,2017,10,24
209,Heaven,"Amazing hotel.. central located.. very clean property, staff from check in to dining staff were helpful.. breakfast had a lot of choices.. rooms were spacious.. hotel is definitely maintained and very clean.. comfortable beds!!",5,2017,10,24
209,Wonderful Stay,"Wonderful over all stay! Staff is great, very friendly and very helpful. Allie the pub on the lower level is fantastic a good time with great food. Recently remodeled and it is beautiful!! All you have to do is take a stroll through the lovely St Stephens Park to get to all the excitement of Dublin.",5,2017,10,24
209,Excellent service coupled with a comfortable room and great amenities in a great location,"As always the service on this recent trip was excellent. I had forgotten a valuable piece of jewellery in the bathroom on a visit the prior month and they had it waiting for me when I returned recently. The location is walking distance to Graftin Street and Temple Bar as well as the surrounding entertainment district. Rooms are always very clean with ample storage options, big screen TV with very good channel selection, multiple USB charging options and North American electrical outlets available as well. Even a Nespresso machine that is replenished daily. No detail has been missed! 

The gym is larger than almost any hotel you’ll find and the restaurant may be one of the best breakfast experiences you’ll have anywhere and a great dinner option! 
 ",5,2017,10,23
209,Birthday weekend made very special ,"Thank you Hilton Conrad for making our stay so perfect. 

We stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate my partners birthday, the staff were so attentive and couldn’t do enough for you! Remarkable service! 5*

A special mention to Phillip on reception for making our stay so memorable. Also to both of the conciage gentlemen who looked after us during our stay.

All staff we encountered were great, all a credit to the Hilton. 

Breakfast was amazing, for somebody who likes to eat healthy, it was really accommodating! Plenty of healthy options! The poached eggs were perfect! 

The gym has everything you need, cardio, fixed weights and free weights! 

Overall the best Hilton I have ever stayed in! 

I would certainly return visit to Conrad Hilton Dublin! Beautiful grand Art Deco hotel and exceptional, engaged staff. 
",5,2017,10,23
209,"Nice rooms, Super-helpful staff, not too far away","Let me start by saying I am very loyal to Marriott properties and the Shelbourne is only a couple blocks away.  We stayed at the Conrad based on a co-traveler's requirement.  We are very glad we did and absolutely will stay at the Conrad any time we are in Dublin.

Location was OK.  We could walk to most of the interesting places and used a taxi for those things a bit further away.  It was very reasonable and certainly found the location to be good.

The staff was SUPER-friendly, definitely a reason to go back.  They helped us with every little thing we could think of.  We were there during a rare Irish Hurricane, so most things around town were closed for one of the days.  The staff took great care of us and many worked a massive number of hours to cover those that couldn't get to town.  Seriously, we would be willing to go back just on staff friendliness.

The rooms were nice and well-kept.  We had no room issues and enjoyed our room.  The rest of the property was good, we spent several nights at the pub downstairs.  Many locals were going in as well, which made it nice.",5,2017,10,23
209,Very nice stay,"We stayed for 3 nights while we visited the city so were out most of the day.  The staff were helpful, the room and bathroom were well appointed and clean. We enjoyed the breakfasts which are not extravagant but have what we liked, there are also some a la carte options included and some that are extra.  I would recommend this hotel and would happily stay again.",5,2017,10,23
209,Excellent stay in Dublin,"We celebrated our 5 year anniversary with a trip to Ireland and stayed in this hotel for our time in Dublin. We had an excellent experience! The breakfast was exceptional, the room was amazing, and the internet was fast and hassle-free. Furthermore, the location of the hotel put us within walking distance of all the sites in Dublin while being in a slightly quieter part of the city. We will stay here again when we return to Dublin!",5,2017,10,22
209,"Great Location, Great Property, Great People","Conrad Dublin is the best hotel to stay in Hilton family. I stayed at Conrad twice during my trip in Dublin. Conrad is my most favorite place to stay. Nice quite location, only few minute short walk to major shopping area and several very popular Irish Pub. The hotel people are very nice and polite with  very professional personality. And the breakfast is the best with many heathy choices.",5,2017,10,20
209,Excellent hotel,"We spend 2 nights in this place. Service was amazing since we arrive. We thanked for the warm welcome after our 12 hours flight. Check-in and luggage delivery to our room very efficient. Breakfast was a great experience, mouthwatering food, gentle service, great quality. Comfy bed, good aromatherapy amenities. Fast Wifi.

The hotel is well located, afar from downtown´s noise, but near enough to pubs, restaurants and attractions, almost in St Stephens Green. The bar, at night, energetic, nice place to make a stop and have a drink. Clean installations and a lot of care into its appearance. In a nutshell, this is an excellent hotel to stay in Dublin.",5,2017,10,20
209,Refined,"Delightful stay. Immaculate room - my favourite Nespresso available - with crisp, white linens and a comfortable bed. Breakfast was fantastic, brioche French toast and perfect pancakes to order exquisite. ",5,2017,10,17
209,"Great accommodations, staff and food ","The Conrad has a great location in Dublin. The rooms are spacious, clean and well equipped. The breakfast buffet is very good and the staff all through out the hotel is very friendly and eager to help. ",4,2017,10,15
209,"High price, low quality and service","I usually let the hotel management know my view before I leave but on this occasion I wasn’t asked and was rushing to the airport. 
First impressions weren’t good: lots of uniformed men hanging around reception chatting to each other. ‘Concierges’? A couple of letters missing off the sign outside. The receptionist was efficient and courteous, though. 
First impressions of the room were good but that didn’t last long! Dialling the air conditioning down during a warm blast in October caused a rattle in the fan. That stayed on all night. You don’t expect noisy air con in a hotel that has these pretensions. No mini bar in the room but a fridge with two small bottles of still water and some milk capsules. No soft drinks as advertised on the website. But actually, why no minibar?
TV was a large-ish Samsung on the wall but no movies or other TV on demand. Just a selection of Irish and UK TV channels. 
Room service was slow and inefficient - two salads produced when I only ordered one. Minimal accompaniments - eg no bread rolls. Glass of wine slightly oxidised. 
Breakfast extremely poor. I think the room might work better at night but at breakfast it felt small and cramped with a poor outlook over a construction site. Essentially a buffet with eggs and other things cooked to order. I ordered scrambled eggs: tiny portion and dry: shaped into a circle and served on top of toast. Much, much more toast than egg. Yeuch. Coffee OK. Salmon good on buffet but limited selection at buffet. You request toast and it is served fresh. The soda bread toast was excellent.
Overall, very poor and certainly not value for money or operating at a high level. Four star just. But even then with weaknesses. 
A shame.",2,2017,10,15
209,Everything was lovely ,"A high standard hotel, very clean, beautifully designed and renovated, attention to detail, bedroom was super, breakfast delicious, staff helpful. Really just can't fault it. Location quiet yet a minute from the busy restaurants and bars. Will come back next time we're in Dublin. ",5,2017,10,14
209,"Very nice hotel, but NOT great!  A bit overrated-","The Conrad is rated 4 1/2 on TripAdvisor rating scale.  That is a bit of a stretch.  Please read the whole write up, as there are both good and not so good aspects of our experience.  First, my wife is a Diamond club member at Hilton (parent company to the Conrad).  If you are Diamond Club, take heed.  Second, we took this trip to Ireland to celebrate our 30th wedding Anniversary.  We didn't tell any of our hotels, as we didn't really want to draw attention to it...this point will make sense in a bit.  Anyway, my wife made our reservations through the Hilton honors concierge and wanting to use some award points, it turned out better to use points on a couple of nights and pay for one.  In doing so, the reservations were made for three separate nights.  That was fine, we appreciated the woman working with us to get us the biggest bang for our buck (and at 180,000 points per night, one would expect a lot of bang!).  Upon check in, they had upgraded us to a junior suite for the first night, but not the other two.  They were not even aware we were there for three consecutive nights.  Upon a bit of research, they could see we had three reservations but unfortunately, the suite was not available for the three nights.  So, to utilize the upgrade, we would have had to move after the first night.  Natasha, the woman at the front desk explained that the system couldn't ""talk to itself"" and understand the three consecutive night situation, so we simply said fine and checked into the deluxe King that we had reserved.  That was fine by us, one room, three nights, no reason to move.  It was 3:50 when we tried to check in, check in was at 4:00, so the room was not yet available (unlike the Morrisson hotel that let us check in at 8:15 AM upon arrival from a late night flight- they DID seem to accommodate Diamond club).  Having left our bags with the bellhop, we did a little walking and came back to the room around 5:30.  Upon return, the bags were in the room, but not on luggage racks, just piled on the floor.  A small detail, but this is supposed to be one of the top hotels in Dublin!  I had to call down for an additional luggage rack for my bag.  It came later and this time, my bag was actually on top of it when we returned.  I had also asked for two foam pillows when I asked for the luggage rack and they too had been delivered, but instead of two additional foam pillows, they had replaced ALL four feather pillows with four foam pillows...my wife did not want foam.  They may have been trying to accommodate the foam pillow thing, but they once again, missed the mark by replacing ALL of them.  At dinner that night, we received an e-mail from the general manager welcoming us to the Conrad (a canned letter of welcome), if there was anything he could do for us, just let him know.  My wife, being the business traveler that she is and general business executive, wrote him back and let him know that the Hilton reservation system seems to have a glitch in it when making reservations like we did and she thought he ought to know.  She noted that it was odd that the hotel did not realize we would be there for three nights and that it was a bit of a disappointment that we were unable to utilize the upgrade during our Anniversary celebration.  She threw that in there so that he was aware of our Anniversary because that will usually draw a bit more of a response, especially at a ""luxury"" hotel.  It did not.  When we woke up the next morning, there was an express check out form slipped under our door.  Wait, after all the dialogue the day before, they still didn't realize we were there for three nights?  So my wife called down to the desk and asked what was going on.  They assured us everything was fine.  That afternoon, she received an e-mail from the hotel confirming our stay that night- as if we had not even checked in yet.  Maddening to say the least.  So, she e-mailed the manager once again about the disconcerting e-mail and this time we got an immediate phone call from Natasha at the front desk.  Instead of being apologetic, she was completely defensive and merely explaining the whole junior suite upgrade situation again, which was already out of mind.  We simply let it go and hoped we wouldn't get another check out slip under the door that night...which we didn't!  Now, to the room.  It was very nice.  Exactly what you would expect from a luxury hotel...slippers, robes, umbrella, safe, etc.  Housekeeping also was VERY good.  No complaints whatsoever about the room or cleanliness.  Breakfast was included, so we took advantage of that every morning and it was excellent.  The location of the hotel was a bit off the beaten path.  If you are there on business, it may be perfect.  If you are there as a tourist, it's just a bit off track.  ""The"" area to be at night is around Grafton Street or Temple Bar- the hotel is on the opposite side of St. Stephen's Green.  A nice walk during the day- through the green even, but at night, you feel rather isolated walking back to the Conrad.  Not a huge deal, but there are so many hotels in the area, you may want to look closer to the hot areas if you don't like to walk too much or are alone.  Overall, it's a very nice hotel.  The breakfast is excellent and the service is very good.  Natasha was not particularly helpful or accommodating, but others were.  We've been to many luxury hotels and in general, if you ever have the slightest of problems or even a little glitch like we did here with the reservations, the hotel normally bends over backwards to make sure all is made right for your visit.  This hotel never did anything of the sort other than writing Happy Anniversary on the plate of complimentary chocolates you get in the evening.  A nice touch, but certainly the minimum they could have done to acknowledge our Anniversary or their mess up.  We are looking into the Shelbourne for our next visit.",4,2017,10,14
209,Luxury Stay in Dublin,"The Conrad is an excellent place to stay in Dublin if you want to treat yourself to luxury accommodations. It is expensive, but well worth the price. Accommodations and service were immaculate. The location is well within walking distance of most Dublin center attractions. Overall, it was a wonderful experience.",5,2017,10,13
209,"Great location, room, amenities, breakfast buffet and restaurant",Location can't be beat just off St Stephens Green and across from National Concert Hall. Room was very comfortable with minifridge andcoffee/tea/bar setup. Service outstanding and thoughtful.  Restaurant (Coburg) amazing for breakfast buffet and dinner with regard to both food and service. Skip Lemuels.,5,2017,10,13
209,Overpriced,Very average 2 star experience. Looks very polished but borders onto a building site that has a very loud alarm and building works start at 0715. You have to pay for WiFi which is clearly absurd in this day and age.,1,2017,10,12
209,Last two days of our Tauck Best of Ireland vacation,"All aspects were outstanding. The Conrad is located in walking distance to Trinity College, to the Museums and safe walking distance to fine restaurants. The amenities in the hotel were complete with good breakfast service and good dinner service.",5,2017,10,11
209,Excellent Hotel - Great Location,"When we stay in Dublin, the Conrad is our first choice.  It's located directly across from the National Concert Hall and about a ten minute walk to the foot of Grafton Street.  The rooms are bright and comfortable and the staff is always accommodating.  We had just arrived from an overnight flight from the U. S. and were able to be in our room by 10:00 AM.If you request that in advance they do their utmost to get you settled.  If you are not a high status Hilton Honors member where it is complimentary, book a rate with breakfast included.  It is excellent!",5,2017,10,11
209,Nightmare,"Elavator performance, hotel personnel performance, safety, and overall experience were way under Conrad standards!  Management personnel were either clueless or do not care.    I am a lifetime Hilton Hhonors Diamond member, and it was a mistake to stay there!",1,2017,10,11
209,Great staff,Airlines lost our luggage but the hotel staff took care of getting it for us. Great restaurant recommendations. Very accommodating. Wonderful. Will definitely be back because of the wonderful people who work there!,5,2017,10,10
209,LOVED IT . ,"What a beautiful hotel and fantastic friendly staff . We thought our room was beautiful and we had a great nights sleep . Can't recommend it enough . The location is ideal , It's a few minutes walk to Grafton Street . ",5,2017,10,10
209,Helpful staff but watch for noise on lower level,"We had a wonderful room, except the noise being on the lower level floor was hard to sleep through.  Nice location that is convenient to things but just out of busy zone.  The concierge and bell men were super helpful and went out of their way for us to get some food when we needed to leave before breakfast was available.",4,2017,10,09
209,"Comfort, style and great service","We stayed at the Conrad Dublin on a long weekend in August. From the moment we stepped in, we felt like we were treated like royalty. We used Hilton Honors points to get our room at a very reasonable price (90 Euro a night), but every staff member we interacted with gave us their full attention and consideration. The room was fresh and modern, and the bed incredibly comfortable. The breakfast buffet was substantial and we were also able to order omelets from the menu (very good). The location was perfect, just a block or two from St. Stephen's Green. We hope to return someday.",5,2017,10,09
209,Great Stay,"Fantastic hotel. Great staff very helpful. Breakfast was great,Great location.I would recommend this wonderful hotel.Room was lovely and clean. Great location right beside the concert hall and St Stephens Green.
",5,2017,10,06
209,top notch with great location,"we stayed at the Conrad for 3 nights in 
Sept before heading out to Dingle where we had rented a house.. we had a suite and it was delightful- very spacious, open airy , full of light- immaculate- large bedroom and very substantial sitting area as well- excellent bathroom with nice hot showers and good water stream- which is not always the case in Europe... had breakfast buffet once, which was very ample... for what is essentially a large business hotel- the service was very personal and friendly- especially when a taxi was needed or any help with luggage- location I s excellent, very quick walk to St Stephen's Green  where we had some good walks and fed the geese and ducks- and severl swans, every morning.. there is an excellent a\barber shop only one block away- and I got a haircut there, which was among the best I have ever had... last time we stayed in Dublin, we were at the Shelbourne- which was excellent- but I rate the Conrad higher- just clean m crisp modern lines- more value for the money in my opinion- we will be back on our next trip...",5,2017,10,05
209,Pleasant Surprise,"From the moment we checked in, everyone was very nice.  We liked out room, beds were comfy, perhaps a little small for 2 beds but the bathroom was very nice and all the amenities were there.  The front desk was very helpful with directions and suggestions.  I believe the person who was very gracious to us was named Rick.  He suggested Sophie's a restaurant on top of the Dean Hotel which was walking distance and we absolutely loved it.  The breakfast was amazing and again everyone was very nice.  Highly recommend, walking distance to many attractions including Stephen's Green. Would stay there again.",5,2017,10,05
209,great location and service,Easy walk to all tourist areas and restaurants.  Beds were very comfortable and the service was very friendly.  We did not try the restaurant on this visit.  The bathroom was clean and had a nice stand-up shower.,4,2017,10,03
209,Wonderful Experience,"I highly recommend staying at the Conrad Dublin.  The service, the decor, the quality of the room, the cleanliness and the quietness of the room could not be beat.  After traveling for two weeks in Europe, the Conrad Dublin could not be beat.  The bed was the most comfortable I slept in.  The service could not have been better.  The location is excellent.  I will be back!",5,2017,10,03
209,Lovely hotel in an ideal location,"We stayed at the Conrad for 2 nights over the weekend and it was lovely. The hotel is in a perfect location, the staff were very friendly and professional and the decor is very tasteful. 

The bed was extremely comfortable - I'd happily sleep in that bed for the rest of my life! It was nice that they gave 4 towels (for a room accomodating 2 people) so that you have a towel for a shower in the evening before going out and then again in the morning. It's a small thing I know, but there's lots of these little things that all add up to a great experience.

The breakfast was very nice with plenty of choices and the service was good even though they were busy.

The only negative I would say is that they provide a docking station in the room and this is great, but only if you have an iPhone. We would have loved to listen to some music whilst getting ready but there was no bluetooth connection on the device nor was there a line in cable. The only way of connecting to it was through an iPhone connection. This is really surprising as there are more Android devices out there than iPhones at this stage. They should have chosen a device that works with as many platforms as possible.

We're going to be back in Dublin in November and are already looking forward to our stay at the Conrad.",5,2017,10,02
209,Shines with polish and flare!,"Excellent customer service. The bellmen are the best. They went out of their way to help and offer advice. The rooms are very modern and comfy. We had a junior suite and we loved it! The workout gym is excellent, they actually had a stationary road bike! The Breakfast is extensive and delicious with a bunch of choices in the buffet, plus a large number of hot options. The bar service was also fun and inventive. Everyone is friendly. The location is right down the street from st. stevens green.",5,2017,09,30
209,Irish eyes are smiling,"Excellent hotel.  Across from the concert hall and steps from St. Stephen's Green.  Close to Trinity College which houses the Book of Kells, and the Grafton Street shopping area; not to mention the many pubs.",5,2017,09,30
209,"Very good stay, just below 5","My wife and me went to Dublin for my wife's birthday celebration.
We stayed at the Conrad for 4 nights.
I sent a message in advance to the Guests' Relation Manager to ask for a little gesture for the birthday and mentionned it also in the booking comments section. At check-in, no upgrade was possible as Gold. I got the e-check-in room (mandatory system selection). No birthday special in the room either. 
Our room was on the 6th floor (refurbished room I assume). Backyard construction view. Nice twin room (no King?). Expresso machine and tea kettle were available, with a nice selection of teas and coffees. Minibar was not stocked (?)
Average standard bathroom with shower in tub.
Very good housekeeping.
We had afternoon teas at Lemuel, complimentary breakfast (as Gold) and dinner at the Coburg brasserie (closing at 11pm, difficult to find a place to eat in Dublin after 9pm). Food was great. Service so so for breakfast (hotel was full), very good at other times. At dinner, a very helpful gentleman helped us for choice.
Food, wines and cocktails were good value for money, room was too expensive.
All in all, a very nice stay, check-in welcome could be warmer. An executive lounge is missing...",5,2017,09,28
209,Firt trip to Ireland,On our 5-day trip to Ireland we spent the first night in Conrad hotel  in Dublin. The staff members were so pleasant and helpful throughout the stay by providing helpful recommendations and assisting us with reservations.  We were even offered a  complimentary ride form the hotel to the Guinness Factory.,5,2017,09,27
209,Great location,"A block from Saint Stephen's Green, and easy walking distance to Grafton Street shopping and many good restaurants, this is a good hotel for both business travelers and tourists. The hotel is contemporary and comfortable rather than striking and dramatic.  Service was good.  The concierge desk was especially helpful in making dinner reservations for us.",5,2017,09,27
209,Great Property in Dublin,"The Conrad was a great stop for us on a 1-week tour of Ireland. The staff was exceedingly friendly and helpful, and the location was within walking distance of so many different sights in Dublin, it made walking around and touring the city extremely easy.",5,2017,09,26
209,Excellent hotel with very frienly staff,"The Conrad is a very nice hotel, rooms were recently renovated, very comfortable, excellent location and very friendly and helpful staff. We can absolutely recommend this great hotel. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street are nearby. Great breakfast. ",5,2017,09,26
209,A wonderful introduction to Dublin,"Terrific location, walkable to everywhere we wanted to go.  Well maintained and excellent decor.  Service at check-in, in the restaurant, and generally throughout was quite good -- professional yet friendly. A slightly cranky server in the bar; but that was truly minimal in light of the rest of the sty",5,2017,09,25
209,"Among the best hotels we have ever stayed in, coupled with a superb restaurant.","My wife and I have travelled widely and throughout the world.  The Conrad Dublin is simply among the several best hotels we have ever stayed in.  Every aspect excelled. The location is also excellent for exploring Dublin on foot.  On top of that, the restaurant is absolutely first rate. We usually make it a practice to eat most of our dinners in a variety of restaurants, but this restaurant was so good --  emphasizing fresh seafood  --  that we returned to it each day.",5,2017,09,25
209,"Friendly, helpful service in a good location","I will definitely stay here on my next trip to Dublin.  I had an early arrival on a Friday morning and was able to check in, no problem.  The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout the stay.  Our room was a good size, nice design.  There was a welcome dish of delicious truffles and then more chocolates with the turndown service.  The breakfast was our best of the trip.  And I loved the location, very convenient to all the main sites and neighborhoods - yet a bit quieter.  I can't think of any negatives; that is unless you are looking for an historic building.  The hotel is definitely modern.  ",5,2017,09,25
209,Modern Business Hotel,"Modern, centrally located hotel in the business district and close to tourist sites. Well equipped rooms and bathrooms. Great bars and restaurants. We stayed as the last stop on a tour. Meeting rooms are available.",4,2017,09,24
209,Very nice hotel,Room was very nice.  Location was excellent to shopping.  Breakfast buffet was very good eith nice selection of items.  Hotel staff were excellent.  Bed was very comfortable.  Pillows were Fabulous...the best ever.,5,2017,09,23

Close to various attractions in the city.
Easy to reach with the transfer bus from the airport, stop is only a short walk away.",5,2017,09,23
209,Nice Room,"Very modern hotel. Room is updated with a very spacious bath and bedroom. People out front are very helpful and welcoming

We just sat in the half full lounge
for over a half hour without being approached.  Staff busy talking among themselves.  Same thing happened this afternoon when we were in for tea.",3,2017,09,21
209,A true sample of perfect hospitality!,"I have stayed at Conrad multiple times during my business trips in Dublin and without doubt it is my favourite hotel in the city. 

Upon arrival I was warmly welcomed by the staff and I was upgraded to the Deluxe King room. The staff was extremely friendly, the restaurant very flexible (appreciate this!) and Stefano from food & beverage deserves a special thanks. He took care of me preparing and delivering a fantastic breakfast every single morning but more importantly his attitude and manners were spotless and impeccable.

Overall experience was awesome. I recommend this hotel to everyone on business in the city.

Stayed: Between July - Sept 2017, travelled on business",5,2017,09,19
209,Absolutely perfect!,"The hotel is fantastic! Not only is the staff very friendly and professional, but the ambiente of the Conrad is great too, no matter if you are talking about the rooms, the restaurant or the bar. Food and service are on a very high level, so there is nothing to complain. All in all, i can really recommend staying in this extraordinary hotel while in Dublin.",5,2017,09,18
209,Nice but overpriced,"For $450/night I expect something more than just nice.  Could be a great restaurant, fantastic room, whatever.  Staff was generally helpful but hotel is simply not that much better than a Westin.  Location was not in the tourist section of town, so that is a plus.",4,2017,09,18
209,The BEST in Dublin!,"Our seven nights at the Conrad Dublin were the best for us.  We traveled most days to different cities, and returned to the warmth of such great hospitality each night. The staff is so kind and caring, everything is a pleasure. There was no request that could not be accomplished and done with ease. The location, easy access to shopping, museums and many fine restaurants as well as their own marvelous Coburg, Lemuel;s and Alfie's Pub.  The perfect hotel to enjoy the center of Dublin.",5,2017,09,17
209,Going the extra mile with a smile!,"Extraordinary experience. Luxury service at it's finest. Many thanks to the staff of Coburg Brasserie for exceeding our expectation and making our visit a very special one. Food is amazing. Staff are very attentive, professional, helpful, patient and they did kill us with kindness. Such great atmosphere. I will highly recommend this place. It's the personal touch and attention to detail that makes our experience a memorable one. Thank you all so much. Will definitely comeback. ",5,2017,09,17

We felt like we were at home; very comfortable setting.  The surroundings were beautiful.  We felt like we were at home.  The staff anticipated all of our needs and wants.  Transportation was easily accessible.",5,2017,09,16
209,Outstanding Hotel,"I can't compliment this hotel enough. I'm checking out tomorrow after 8 nights here, and it's been the most enjoyable hotel stay I've ever had - when travelling for work, at least! The location is fantastic, with plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance and an easy cut through St Stephen's Green to get to Grafton Street. The hotel itself is very modern, and the rooms and facilities absolutely live up to its 5* rating.

The best thing about this hotel, however, are the staff. I travel a lot with work, running events in hotels. I have never experienced service and people are great as I have at the Conrad. Special mentions to John, who picked me up from the airport and went the extra mile at any given opportunity; Rachael in sales, for organising a fantastic event; and Thomas, Karen, and Rebecca in C&B for going over and above to make sure that everything ran perfectly. Absolutely flawless service, and genuinely nice people.

I will definitely be returning to this hotel, and I would absolutely encourage others to do the same.",5,2017,09,16
209,Great spot in Dublin,"This was a very classy hotel,nice location! Especially good for business travelers. Next to St. Stephens Park plus great shopping areas. Also close to many great restaurants. We were on a Tauck tour and they only stay in the nicest hotels. Tis qualifies.",4,2017,09,16
209,Luxury level hotel,"Arrived in Dublin very early morning and arrived at the hotel about 9 am and was into the room by 10 with no prearranged early check-in. Staff were efficient and always smiling. Room was bright and well appointed, spotlessly clean. 
Breakfast buffet was very good with lots of choices and something for everyone's taste.
Very centralized location near a large park.",5,2017,09,16
209,Luxury is Luxurious,"We've stayed at the Conrad on multiple occasions and it is consistently excellent. Cheerful staff typically take excellent care of any question or need we might have. The rooms are comfortable with excellent linens. The breakfast is excellent. The lounge and the pub downstairs offer multiple environments to have a beverage with friends. Finally, the location is superior. It is a half-block from St. Stephen's Green and therefore a lovely stroll from Grafton Street and all the shops and pubs you could hope to explore.",5,2017,09,12
209,well positioned and well done,"I usually stay at the Westbury, but it was full. The Conrad is on the other side of Green Park, still well located and MUCH quieter. A big plus at night.
The rooms are comfortable , clean and well appointed.
The service is very good. 
The food is slightly off great, with a fairly limited choice, particularly in the bar area.
I would be happy to return.",4,2017,09,12
209,Best Place to Stay!,"From arrival until check out can honestly say that I truly love this hotel and will be returning.

209,Comfortable Dublin weekend,Conrad Dublin was a very comfortable and relaxing place to visit. The staff was OUTSTANDING and the location is perfect to all the main attractions and streets for shopping and eating.

209,Conrad Dublin - W/C 21/08/17,"Welcoming, friendly and professional Staff - Good quality Rooms & Service - Good location -  Very disappointed that Room Rates have more than doubled since my last stay and therefore unlikely to stay again unless Room Rates reduced to more reasonable levels.",5,2017,09,08
209,Weekend Stay in Dublins Conrad Hilton,"The hotel, bar, pub and resturant were all immaculatly clean and well presented.

The staff were very helpful without being overpowering, especially the resturant, everyone seemed to know what they should be doing.

And lastly the room, just luxury, well equiped and clean

I would definately stay again",5,2017,09,08

209,Conrad Dublin is a great place to stay.,"I am a frequent business traveler and a loyal Hilton Honors member, and so chose this hotel based on using points.  After staying here this time, I would stay here again, points or not.  This is a lovely hotel, the staff are responsive and right there for anything you need.  The room was clean, up to date with terrific beds and bedding and a lovely bathroom.  I would recommend a stay here for either business or pleasure travel.  Enjoyed every minute of the stay and have absolutely nothing negative to say.",5,2017,09,07

Wonderful stay!
",5,2017,09,07
209,Lovely central Hotel,"location in City Centre is excellent. Lovely bright spacious hotel.
Travelled with husband, adult sons and their partners for the weekend.
Booked 3 rooms for 3 nights, certainly at the top end of the market with regard to cost!
Rooms spacious with good amenities, good quality toiletries.
King size bed very comfortable with good quality linens.
Breakfast buffet is small, however, it does have everything you need plus the option to order freshly prepared food from a small menu. delivered quickly and efficiently.
great service from the waitress's at breakfast, professional, polite and friendly staff, loved the fresh coffee in the cafetiere! 
Bar is quite nice, airy and spacious, nice outside terrace, especially as the weather was excellent, service  was 'ok', food was average quality, not sure we would eat there again as there are so many restaurants nearby that serve excellent food for a similar price..... 1 gripe from everyone... NO Guinness... in a City centre Irish Bar????
Taxi rank outside hotel was a bonus!
quick efficient check in and check out.
",5,2017,09,07
209,Five star stay.,"The Conrad is ideally located just off the Saint Stephens Green in Dublin.Perfect for Shopping,sight seeing, Theatre and the best of Dublin's night life . The staff are the friendliest we have ever encountered in any hotel. The breakfast is an experience not to be missed. They have everything. You can even order a steak! The room was comfortable, modern and well equipped. There is a formal bar off the lobby and a craft beer bar down at basement level which has an outdoor seated area. Bar food is available and it seems to be very popular with the general public and patrons of the National Concert Hall which is directly across the street. We had a five star stay at the Conrad and we will definitely be returning very soon.",5,2017,09,07
209,Hurricane Irma,"We had to change our reservation due to Hurricane Irma.  We booked through American Express Travel and it had restrictions, but they waived it for this case.

209,Outstanding hotel,"My friends and I have just returned from Dublin and stayed at this gorgeously welcoming hotel for our friends 50th.
The staff are all a credit to Hilton brand and go above and beyond to assist with your vacation.
Not to single anyone out but John, Liam, Jim, the pleasant young lady at front desk and the South African gentleman.
You all went way above and beyond to assist and guide us each morning!
Truly wonderful care.
The breakfast room was fantastic and Coleen was so helpful, meeting us each morning with her lovely smile.
Michael and Luiz from the bars were ever helpful and polite.
Miriam and her sister who tended my room looked after my friend and I and did so with courtesy and speed.
Thanks to one and all but particularly Liam, our new BF.
Well done all 👍

209,'A Lovely Experience',"The title is my wife's and I couldn't put it better. The hotel is well designed and very well staffed- all polite, friendly and unfailingly helpful. Breakfast first class; this was our only experience of the waiting staff and they were excellent. My only (mild) criticism is that the room (we up-graded to 'superior') could have been a little larger for the price.",5,2017,09,04
209,Great place to stay,"My husband and I had a great stay at this hotel.  The bed was comfortable, breakfast buffet was delicious, and the location was just perfect.  We stayed for two nights and really appreciated the proximity to the shops, hop on hop off bus, and St Stephens park.",5,2017,09,04
209,Great location,"We had a lovely stay overall- convenient location, wonderful restaurant (and Alfie Byrne's downstairs), courteous staff. The bar also had a nice cocktail selection. Rooms were nice, and housekeeping does a fabulous job. Did have once incidence with a leaking A/C vent and a not as helpful night manager, but the rest of the experience made up for it. Would def stay here again. Note to those with families: only two ppl per room unless you book a suite (sofa bed for the third person/child). Note to Hilton hhonors gold or higher- no executive lounge but the restaurant had one of the BEST breakfast selections ever. ",5,2017,09,03
209,Very nice and well run hotel,"The hotel had very helpful, friendly and polite staff. The staff helped us with tips at getting around the city and booked a cab to the Airport for us. The room was clean and had nice amenities. We stayed in a room with a balcony. The balcony was disappointing though. It faced a building and was build on a dirty roof. The breakfast buffet was the best hotel buffet I had ever had. ",4,2017,09,03
209,"High service, great location","We are HH diamond members so looked for this brand when in Dublin. We arrived via airlink a block away about 10am and they had my room ready!  So helpful after an all night trip.  The room was recently redecorated though modest in size (king size bed, espresso machine, great shower and tub with tall sides---may be difficult for some to get in and out).  I used points to offset the room rate that was typical of a well positioned urban hotel.  We were given a very high end breakfast (continental and option to order from 3-5 full breakfasts). Examples of the extra mile included fresh honeycomb, black and white pork pudding, fresh musli/yogurt etc.  The dining room is beautiful and there is a large, nicely decorated bar/lounge area (we were given 2 free alcoholic drinks and 2 coffee/tea).  Taxis were called from the front desk easily; the hop on hop off bus came by within 3-4 blocks.  We enjoyed walking in Stephen's green.  It was probably walkable from Temple Bar but we were kind of turned around so caught a taxi home.",5,2017,09,01
209,Superb 24 hours in Dublin!,"It was a whirlwind 30 hours in Dublin, but made extra special by the wonderful accommodations and service at the Conrad Dublin! Loved every minute of it. Will definitely return. Fair warning: the beds are so comfortable you won't want to get up go!",5,2017,09,01
209,Premium Service - Understated but the best in Dublin,"For business or leisure, this is the premium hotel for Dublin. What sets it apart for Dublin is the consistency of high quality service. It is nicely located near city centre, and whilst the building does not have a wow factor, the recent renovation has been done well. I stay in Dublin several times a month and have stayed at many hotels in the City, but these guys are the best. They have a great way of combining a quality decor, nice bar, brasserie, breakfast with attentive care for their guests.",5,2017,08,31
209,Perfect city center stay,"I stayed here for 3 nights last weekend. I have stayed here on several occasions over the past few years and keep coming back for its location, price point, understated ambiance, and amenities. The hotel was refurbished last year and is quietly elegant.  The lobby, while not imposing, is cool, clam, and quiet.  This hotel is on the quieter side of St. Stephen's Green so has less traffic and noise at night yet is only a stone's throw from all the hubbub.  The service is exemplary from start to finish.  The king deluxe room wanted for nothing.  The bed was very comfortable and the room fully kitted out with capsule coffee maker, tea, hairdryer, makeup mirror at average female height (much appreciated as most installed by men at 6 foot high!), slippers, bathrobes, sockets galore, fast wifi, full minibar, safe, plenty of REMOVABLE hangers (thank you),etc, etc.  The breakfast was a lovely experience with fantastic service, full buffet and also a la carte cooked to order choices.  I loved my stay here and would advise people to consider this hotel which is competitively priced at a very good 5 star level.  This is no average Hilton!",5,2017,08,30
209,Gorgeous Property,"The Conrad Dublin offers all one would expect from Hilton's Conrad properties - well appointed rooms, beautiful open spaces and an excellent bar. The hotel is nearby a wide selection of restaurants and pubs and staff were friendly and accommodating.",5,2017,08,29
209,a real nice positive surprise,"we chose the king size deluxe suite which was really a beautiful room, very spacious with a big bathroom as well, a real dinner table with 4 chairs, a living room area with a second TV, which is maybe the weakest spot, the selection of TV programs is really small  and the pay movie channels not exist. The rooms are very clean and the King-size bed guaranteed a very high level of sleeping comfort.
Breakfast buffet is nice, staff is very friendly and helpful",4,2017,08,29
209,Nine Hours -Brilliant!,"If you are trying to decide between this hotel and another, then this should be an easy choice! Choose Conrad everytime, they will make it worth your while. Incredible Stay for the nine hours that we were there -com",5,2017,08,29
209,Fantastic Stay,"We used Hilton points to stay five nights in this very nice hotel. Due to my Hilton Honors Diamond status the hotel upgraded our room, included the full breakfast (which was very good) and provided us with coupons for free drinks.  The service was excellent and our room was very nice.  The common area were also very nice.  The furniture and decorations all looked new.",5,2017,08,28
209,Very nice hotel,"This hotel is a very American type hotel. It has everything you would want and walking distance to St. Stephen's Green.  Breakfast is very busy, so if you have to get out early make sure you allow plenty of time. Quiet rooms, comfy beds, and average bathrooms round out the room.",4,2017,08,27
209,Birthday,"Great location of the hotel. Lovely renovated rooms with comfy beds. Nice breakfast and cocktails selection. We liked the new design of the hotel.
Restaurant food and staff nothing special there's loads of better restaurants around the hotel.

209,Great location and wonderful staff,This hotel has a great location within walking distance to shopping and other attractions. We were very pleased with the helpful and courteous staff. We also liked the pub downstairs for a refreshment after a long day of touring.,5,2017,08,24
209,Great Dublin Hotel,"In recent times the Conrad Dublin has been refurbished having previously been a little tired. The changes are really fantastic and it is again a really lovely hotel in Dublin. I stayed there recently again and was extremely impressed. All the staff are fantastic and nothing seemed to be too much trouble.  The rooms were super comfortable and very bright & airy. There were plenty of charging points too to keep phones, ipads and laptops charged. The two most important things in a hotel room for me are a comfortable bed and a great shower. The Conrad delivered pretty well on both - perhaps the shower pressure could have been a little higher, but it was just fine. No complaints.  There was a time when the other top level competitors in town were quite far ahead of the Conrad, but things have changed and it is definitely worth a try. From a value point of view it would compare very well with the Shelbourne or the Merion",5,2017,08,23
209,Well located modern hotel,"You do not give up much staying at this fine hotel. Its location is great for reaching many attractions on foot. We were able to walk to the National Art Gallery and the National History Museum with ease. But back to the hotel. The rooms are modern and truly large. The breakfast buffet is quite adequate, the staff in the reception very helpful.",5,2017,08,22
209,Beautiful property - amazing renovation!,"I just stayed at the recently renovated Conrad Dublin and was wonderfully surprised by the dramatic renovation of the hotel's public areas and guest rooms. This property is the best in Dublin now with great bars, restaurants, and service. Go now and you won't be disappointed!",5,2017,08,21
209,Not the Ritz,"5 star ????. Staff and service yes 5 star. Food 4 star. Room disappointing and I was upgraded. This is a nice hotel but very small. Restaurant and bar lovely but not much room. Bed room same and we where on the 7th floor. Over all I think it's like a good london hotel with very little space. Location very good and I say it again staff top class. Would I come back ...not to sure

209,dont expect to be treated as a diamond,been staying here for past 10 yrs hotel has undergone a major refurbishment - plusses are the staff who are long time employees they are warm welcoming and extremely friendly helpful - hotel is not as family friendly as it once was - as a diamond or gold honors member  you won't be recognized or perhaps treated lessor than other guests   breakfast is still very good beds are now ore comfortable tv channels are improved as well,3,2017,08,18
209,Great Experience,I really loved this hotel.  The room was modern and luxurious.  The bed was very comfortable.  I found the staff to be very friendly helpful staff.  Great breakfast buffet with a lot to choose form.  Good location.,5,2017,08,17
209,Wonderfully cool and quiet room,"We arrived in Dublin from the US at about 10:00am expecting to store our luggage and grab a bite but were pleasantly surprised to find an available room. Dublin was warmer than expected and a beautiful cool and quiet room was a pleasant welcome. The lobby and bar area was very pretty and classy, and the staff members were all helpful and gracious during our stay.  
Noting some prior reviews, we stayed on the fourth floor, the air conditioning was wonderful, the room quiet and no construction visible or heard. 
The location was very convenient and we would recommend this hotel.",5,2017,08,16
209,Fantastic Stay at Conrad Dublin!,"Luxury hotel in a great location close to St. Stephen's Green.  Staff was attentive, room was clean and spacious.  There is a taxi row right outside the hotel.  Breakfast was delicious, featuring a variety of choices.  We will be staying there again on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2017,08,16
209,Wonderful Hotel In A Great Location,"We spent 5 night at the Conrad Dublin.  I had e-mailed after booking to request interconnected rooms and they guaranteed them for me. We arrived before check in time, but they offered to have our rooms cleaned right away or two rooms next to each other, but not interconnected.  We opted to wait and they held our luggage while we went to have lunch.  Our rooms were ready when we returned.  Right from the start we knew we would be well taken care of.

We ate at the restaurant for breakfast each morning and for dinner 1 night. We also ate at the pub downstairs and would recommend.  Housekeeping was great.  They kept the room clean and replaced towels and coffee daily.  Bed and linens were super comfortable.  My teens had twin beds that were huge, more like double beds.  We look forward to returning again on our next visit.",5,2017,08,15
209,Satisfied Guest,"I really enjoyed my stay in the Conrad Hoel. All the Staff werd extremely pleasant, helpful and couteous at all times  My room was very comfortable and warm. The hotel was very convenient to the N.C.H. which was the purpose of my stay. I rely enjoyed my Breakfast and the wifi access was brilliant",5,2017,08,14
209,Best place to stay in Dublin,"We have stayed at the Conrad several times on our annual trips to Ireland. We love it. Located in the center of Dublin and near shopping and dining choices. Has the feel of a business traveler hotel but the entire staff makes it feel more like a B&B caring environment. Won't stay anywhere else in Dublin.

209,Very relaxing,A recent stay at this hotel was so relaxing. The staff were very attentive at all times. The room on the 6th floor was very comfortable and the view towards the mountains was beautiful. The afternoon tea was especially enjoyable. Thanks to all at this hotel for every comfort and care. A truly lovely hotel.,5,2017,08,10
209,Always good....,"Stayed here again for our recent trip into Dublin City. 
Love the location; just a small stroll across St Stephens green to the centre of the city, ideal. 
The hotel was recently refurbished and the bar and restaurant are much improved. Great cocktail menu too! 
The food was fab also.  

We'll be back (again!).

209,Wonderful staff !,"We really enjoyed our stay . Rooms were clean and quiet and bed was very comfortable . Staff was lovely and very helpful especially Jack (from Cork) who was at the front desk . He offered to print out boarding passes , assisted with calling a taxi , exchanging money , anything we needed he was ready to assist us . He really was professsional and courteous . Staff in the bar and restaurants were also helpful and pleasant . Top notch service !",4,2017,08,08
209,Another great stay at an excellent Hotel,"I have stayed at the Dublin Conrad several times in the past. This trip was just as great as the other trips. The staff are knowledgeable, friendly, and always willing to meet any request. The breakfast selection was extensive and very good.  Lunch and dinner were also excellent. Wonderful location, close to major shopping areas and great restaurants. ",5,2017,08,08
209,"Exquisite hotel, perfect stay.","It was great to see such a stunning hotel, after a long bit of travel to get there.  The lobby is gorgeous, the staff is extremely welcoming, and the rooms are perfectly appointed.  My one tiny issue would be with the layout of the shower, which has a half glass partition and makes it slightly difficult to run the shower without getting soaked.  Aside from that, this room was modest in size but so beautifully furnished that it didn't feel cramped one bit.  The location was central and easy to walk around many of the sites.  I would highly recommend this property to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2017,08,08
209,What a hotel!!,I stayed here in July and although the weather wasn't kind the hotel was just perfect. We arrived early and were able to check in with no problem. What a delight considering the long flight we had. The bed was extremely comfy and the curtains blacked out any light. We had drinks in the craft beer bar which was a delight and the cocktails in lemeuls where amazing. There was an Australian chap on reception who was always cheerful and the tall young concierge I think kamal.. was always there to help. Perfect location for a nice quiet sleep but close enough to some decent pubs and restaurants. Would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay again.,5,2017,08,08
209,Perfect,"My family booked this for my husbands 30th birthday trip to Dublin and it really was the perfect choice. Far away enough from busy city centre, but close enough to quickly walk into centre. Near to the beautiful St Stephens green. Hotel was clean, tidy and quiet. Staff were excellent, attentive and smiley! Bed was lovely, room was so dark so had 3 really fabulous nights sleep. Breakfast was wonderful, a lovely selection. Thank you for a great stay!",5,2017,08,07
209,Recommend Conrad Dublin,Hotel is beautiful and liveable. Staff anticipate needs and are examples of helpfulness.  The entire staff are gracious and anxious to please but in a quiet reserved manner.  Food is excellent and well presented.  I recommend that you stay here if you are in Dublin.,5,2017,08,07
209,Family stay,"We stayed for a night as a family.  Stunning hotel, great location.  There is a less formal (if you have kids) little pub in the hotel which is fabulous, definitely worth a visit.

Rooms beautiful.  Breakfast is 1st class, as was the service

▪️Previous stays: One
▪️Recommend: Yes",4,2017,08,05
209,You get what you pat for,"Prices are steep ( not unlike the rest of the city) but the service was exceptional at every turn, the rooms were very comfortable and well appointed, convenient location to walk to local attractions and shopping.  Area around the hotel is quiet so there is not a lively night life in the immediate area, however, it is a very short cab ride away",5,2017,08,05
209,At over €300 a night for a standard room it doesn't hit the mark. Look elsewhere.,"First impressions are good. Really nice lobby, friendly reception staff. But no doorman. 

As a Hilton Gold member, I was upgraded to a room on the higher floors. The room was a reasonable size, immaculate and tastefully decorated with a modern/contemporary feel. The property next door is undergoing building works but didn't hear any noise during my two-night stay.  

The bar is also nicely decorated, and has a good selection of whisky/whiskey. Service was variable (initially attentive, but had to approach the bar to reorder on both occasions even though it wasn't busy), and staff lacked knowledge on the menu. Having requested a Swedish whisky (which I was pleasantly surprised to see on the menu) the staff member had to go and check with another; on them not being able to locate it she then pulled an Arran (a Scottish island whisky) off the back bar and suggested it. Hardly the same. 

The hotel has a couple of restaurants - Alfie's and Coberg. The first has pub food including a number of veggie options. The second (which is also where breakfast is served) has very limited veggie options (pasta and salad, with the vast majority of menu being meat and fish). I didn't dine in either given so many options nearby in town. 

Breakfast was a disappointment. No orientation was provided with regards to what was a la carte (such as ""toast"") vs self service. On being seated (and it not being particularly busy) it took 10 minutes from ordering to get a cup of tea. Having stayed at many hotels in the Hilton Group, I was looking forward to their buffet breakfast. They had a selection of Continental and Full Irish, however lacking many of the usual spread of cooked items such as potato scones, baked beans, etc. The only eggs available on the buffet were poached, and very rubbery (I've had better from McDonalds). Service more resembled a cafe than a 5 star hotel in terms of quality and attentiveness, at one point with a staff member reaching over the table to take my plate. 

Whilst it's clear the hotel has recently undergone an extensive refurbishment they have bizarrely cut corners on some paint/varnish. A few examples:
- Some doors and fixtures are worn / in need of painting. 
- The flooring in the main restaurant is in need of varnishing, with significant score marks at the smaller tables on wooden floor near the window. 

A few other issues with service, which whilst each relatively minor expect more from a premium hotel:
- No orientation on hotel facilities (other than where breakfast was served) was provided. 
- On returning from a day's sightseeing at 5pm, the minibar hadn't been replenished. On requesting it to be, 7.5 month out of date potato chips were provided. On politely highlighting this at check out - having opened one and taken a bite before checking the date - the staff member didn't even acknowledge it, let alone apologise. 
- If you want to reach a department via phone - good luck! During the stay, the few times I tried the correct department it rang out continuously on multiple tries. You need to call reception to get an answer. 
- The room didn't contain a bottle opener so requested one. A barman arrived to open the bottle but not provide one, so highlighting I was intending on having a couple promised they'd return with one. Over half an hour later they had not, but on calling again one was quickly provided. 
- The room didn't have an information booklet on the hotel and it's facilities. 
- Check out was a slow and laborious affair... providing details of additional minibar consumption I was then presented with a bill without them, nor any credit applied for the booking via Amex. 

In all, lots of small issues that - considering the rack rate - is disappointing. I'll stay somewhere else next time I'm in Dublin.",2,2017,08,05
209,Great Overnight Stay,Great overnight stay in a classic hotel. Good amenities and rooms very well furnished to a good standard. Within walking distance of the main city centre and not far from the Luas.Staff very pleasant and helpful. Breakfast very good choice and tasty.,5,2017,08,04
209,Great Location,For our first trip to Ireland this hotel was perfect because it was within walking distance of many of Dublin's great attractions.  The rooms were clean and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  The food was great and the pub was everything we could have hoped.  We got to experience much of the Irish culture the first day because of the proximity of the Conrad Dublin!,5,2017,08,04
209,Excellent stay!,We arrived well before regular check in as we had a very early flight from Iceland. To our surprise our rooms were ready and we were able to get settled in before wandering around Dublin. The hotel made a reservation at a recommended restaurant nearby. We went to the hotel bar for a nightcap after dinner. One of the bartenders was a wealth of knowledge regarding Irish Whiskey. What a treat that was!,5,2017,08,01
209,Best place to stay in Dublin,"This is a great hotel. The rooms are immaculate and there are extras that everyone loves! Slippers (that are disposable) and a bathrobe to use makes this stay a spa experience. The lotions are top quality and they use the most comfortable bed linens. There is a restaurant and bar on site so you can relax and enjoy. Also, I felt very safe staying here since you needed a room key to use the elevator as well as opening you room. I loved the USB ports were available at the desk in the room so you didn't need a converter. It was a great stay!",5,2017,07,31
209,The best,"Everything was seamless from checkin to wi-fi, concierge, and checkout. I stayed at dinkier place right after this and the juxtaposition highlighted what top notch hospitality is about. My only regret is not having stayed here longer. ",5,2017,07,31
209,"Location, Location, Location","Very close to St Stephens Green which only one reason to make this hotel your go to for Dublin.  An easy walk to Grafton Street, a little longer trek to Temple Bar area, if bussing in from the airport the stop is but a block away.  The breakfast is wonderful but unfortunately that is the best dining experience in this hotel. 
Typically arrived very early morning, i.e four am, they would always pour us a pint or two before breakfast, welcome to Ireland ! Rooms are  adequate, pub in lower level was closed the last visit, hopefully that is not permanent and may well be operational as it has been awhile since last visit.",5,2017,07,30
209,Best Hotel in Dublin,"I stood at the Conrad, Dublin end of July 2017.  I was there for the U2 Concert and had a Junior Suite.  This hotel is second to none!  Beautifully decorated, the rooms were spotless!!  And the staff was friendly and paid attention to every detail!  We checked in on Thursday morning, were i briefly mentioned that we were going to the u2 concert that coming Saturday.  When we returned from the concert late Saturday evening we were pleasantly surprised to find a lovely piece of chocolate cake with a note from the staff welcoming us back from a great evening!  Wow that is attention to detail!  Incredible Hotel.",5,2017,07,30
209,Outstanding City hotel,"Service, Service, Service... Wow.

Upon arriving into Dublin (after a long flight from the US), we requested an early check in and they came through with no issue whatsoever, so at noon, we were in our rooms and where able to freshen up and rest a bit.

The rooms are stunning. The beds newly renovated and the beds, pillow and linens were very high quality and very comfortable.

The amount of folks ready to help was impressive. There seemed to always be 3 or 4 staff at the from desk willing to assist with restaurant recommendations, and guidance on things to do.

We also had drinks in the bar off the lobby, which was very comfortable. We also had breakfast in the main restaurant and it was outstanding. The buffet spread was impressive and had something for everyone. 

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay that the Conrad and will surely visit this hotel if our travels takes us to Dublin. I am a Marriott Platinum elite member and I prefer the Conrad over the Marriott Shelburn without hesitation. Cheers!",5,2017,07,28
209,Lackluster,"This hotel is a nice property but failed to execute all around.   Our main disappointment was room service.  It was as if the people running the entire procedure was unfamiliar with the standards expected in luxury hotels.  The food was prepared poorly (such as a cesar salad with more dressing than lettuce) or a request for service for 2 people (which we had to request as opposed to the staff asking) and then only receiving one fork.  On another room service order, we received 2 salt shakers, no pepper.  The location of the property was great, and the room was clean and modern.",3,2017,07,28
209,Confortable but big chain hotel,"We were able to stay at the Conrad on a recent trip to Dublin, the hotel is very nice and the rooms are well appointed.  Generally we like to stay in smaller hotels or B&Bs when traveling in Europe but opted for the Conrad because we were able to use Hilton Honors points.  Very nice high end hotel but located a bit outside of the main tourist areas but the walk through and near the park was very nice.",4,2017,07,27
209,Conrad Dublin for U2 at Croke Park,Our experience at the Conrad in Dublin far surpassed our expectations.  The wonderful service and amenities of the Conrad added very much to our experience. Special thank-you to Manager Deepu who so warmly welcomed us and made sure that we were very well taken care of.  We highly recommend the Conrad and its fine staff.,5,2017,07,27
209,Top notch facility,"This hotel was absolutely wonderful to stay at.   It was located in a central part of Dublin enabling walking to most places.   The hotel staff was top notch.   Warm, helpful and very service oriented. I would recommend the Conrad Dublin to anyone coming to Dublin. ",5,2017,07,25
209,"Professional Staff, Great Buffet Breakfast.","Staff are top notch and I are the best hotel staff of any hotel I've stayed in Ireland. From the night porter, Michael, whom greeted us at 5.30am with a cheery smile and friendly manner, to the receptionist, and the staff at the buffet breakfast each morning.

The location is on a quiet street very close to Saint Stephen's Green and the City Center. Our room was comfortable and very little street noise could be heard. The bed was comfortable and the shower was good and the bathroom was very clean. Buffet breakfast was served with french press coffee that was tasty and porridge/oatmeal was fresh made. The bar in the lower floor has a good selection of imported beer and beers from Galway Brewing Company (and excellent Onion Rings). I thought parking at 20 euros a night was not overpriced for this central location.

My only complaint was that we checked-in in early AM and slept for a few hours and found it hard to sleep due to other guests slamming their doors.",5,2017,07,24
209,Location and Staff Top Notch,I greatly appreciated the welcoming staff.  they were professional and helpful and made the stay for myself and my family and enjoyable experience.  Great location to the park and great shopping and dining areas.,5,2017,07,24
209,Weekend break in Dublin,"Stayed for 2 nights in Dublin at this wonderful hotel.  Just south of St Stephens Green, this was an ideal location for the Iveagh Gardens which was the purpose of our visit.

On arrival at the hotel we were greeted warmly and allowed to check in early without comment.  We had expected to just be able to leave our bags until check in time!

We stayed in a Superior room which was large, well appointed and very quiet.  Everything was spotless including the bathroom, although it could have been improved with a separate rather than over the bath shower.

Our room included a coffee machines with pods provided, mini fridge with water alongside the usual tea bags and hot chocolate sachet.

Breakfast was very good with a full breakfast buffet labelled to show that the sausages, bacon etc were Irish produce.  Good selection of homemade muffins, cakes, scones and croissants.  There were also a menu that you could order from which included things like French toast, pancakes and omelettes.  The only thing that could have been improved on was the wait time for someone to come back and check if you did want to place an order, but I am being very picky here.

Location is brilliant for the city centre, and just round the corner from one of the airport shuttle stops.

Will be visiting again.",5,2017,07,23
209,A pleasant surprise,"My husband and I stayed at the Conrad Dublin recently, during a shopping trip. We have stayed there a number of times before. We both agree that it has improved over the years. Breakfast was excellent ( those fresh blueberries!). The layout of the breakfast room is also much improved, compared to previous years. Service was 5 star. The only small issue for us was the view from the room. I would highly recommend The Conrad, Dublin.",5,2017,07,21
209,The Best Hotel in Dublin,"I stayed at the Conrad Dublin for my first visit to Ireland. The entire staff were so kind and welcoming and knowledgeable of Dublin City and the country of Ireland. The food, the service, the rooms, the concierge staff - were all wonderful. The location of the hotel is perfect as its not in all the tourist action but close enough to walk to if that's what you're looking for. The hotel is directly across from the Dublin National Concert Hall which offers concerts and entertainment throughout the month. Taxi's are lined up outside of the hotel juts a whistle away from taking you anywhere! The rooms are beautifully decorated with all modern amenities and HOT water shower's with dual showerheads! The food at the Conrad is mouth watering!! if you want to be spoiled and eat great meals stay at the Conrad Dublin...PLEASE?????",5,2017,07,21
209,Birthday dinner,"This hotel is just beautiful. The bar is lovely has a nice relaxing feel to it, the wine list is very good, the staff are so friendly and helpful. We had dinner in the Coburg restaurant the food was first class everything you would expect and more from a five star hotel. The menu had a very good variety and the children's menu was excellent. The staff are so helpful and friendly. I would highly recommend this Hotel it is a bit expensive but you really do get what you pay for.",5,2017,07,19
209,Excellent Location,"This is a wonderful location. Rooms were very nice and the AC worked, always a plus in any European hotel!  Staff was very friendly and helpful. Couldn't ask for a better location. Just half a short block from St Stephen's Green",5,2017,07,19
209,Another excellent stay,"We were attending a family birthday party in Dublin and although we only live in Maynooth we decided to stay in town.  As my husband travels a lot we always make use of his Hilton Honours points. We have stayed in the Conrad many times and I'm delighted to say we have never had a bad experience. 
We arrived early around midday as we had plans to visit the Guinness Storehouse and we were delighted to find our room was ready. We had room 625 and it was lovely. The bed was so comfortable and the room had everything we needed and more. The free shoe shine service was a lovely touch. We were out for most of the day but had a nightcap in the residents bar. Again the staff were lovely. The following morning we went down for breakfast which is served until 11am. There was a great choice of hot and cold dishes and the omelette was delicious. We had a great stay and will definitely return soon.",5,2017,07,19
209,Fantastic!,"This hotel was perfect! Expensive but well worth the money. Great location and the breakfast was very,very,good. Staff was outstanding! We didn't have to eat again until dinner. We will stay here the next time we visit Dublin. ",5,2017,07,18
209,Very disappointing,"This would have been good for a 3-star hotel, but not for Hilton's top of the line. We stayed for three nights and the experience was a let down. Two nights there was no turn down or attention to the room. The concierge service ranged from outstanding to ""I can't be bothered"", but the front desk was outstanding. 

Two out of three breakfasts were terrible. The buffet items were outstanding, but after seating and the initial coffee, the wait staff had to be called. They never would come back to check to see if we needed anything that was not on the buffet. I felt they may have been shunning us.

The staff at Lemuel's Bar and Lounge generally did a good job.",2,2017,07,17
209,Excellent hotel,"Great location , excellent staff and service , I will definitely stay there again , the breakfast had superb selection for all tastes , the staff go beyond there way to help you and make sure your stay is exceptional . ",5,2017,07,17
209,Overnight Conrad Hotel Dublin,"We only stayed one night, Saturday, in the Conrad and they couldn't not have been more helpful.  Almost overwhelmingly so!  Good sized bedroom and larger than normal bathroom - it was perfect location for the National Concert Hall, and restaurants, which was why we chose it.  Single 'small' gripe was that I had to put my suitcase on the floor as there was no luggage rack, or at least none that I could find.  ",5,2017,07,17
209,Nice hotel but not 5*,"My wife and I stayed here at the weekend. The check in staff were attentive and friendly. The room was bright, comfortable and clean as you would expect. We dined in the city that bight and when we came back went to the hotel bar for drinks. The waitress was rude and dis interested. She literally threw us our drinks on the table and did not give us a receipt upon payment. The Guinness tasted terrible and I returned it, the barman was very good and gave me a replacement drink. There was no atmosphere and I would not classify as 5*",3,2017,07,17
209,"Great property, helpful staff, comfortable rooms","We arrived at the Conrad after a 14-hour flight around noon and thankfully our room was ready. The bed was so comfortable and breakfast was included with our stay. The staff was always willing to help us make reservations or help us get around Dublin. Plus, it's in one of the best locations. We definitely recommend this hotel in Dublin.",5,2017,07,15
209,Jem of a City,"Dublin is a real fun city to visit, especially when you stay at the Conrad Hotel. The Conrad is centrally located in Dublin within walking distance to some pf Dublin's finest resturants, pubs and famous Grafton Street. The Conrad Hotel is a perfect Hotel in a perfect location, with an award winning staff.",5,2017,07,13
209,Delightful surprise,"Charming, clean lines - wonderful hotel. Attractive setting.  Wonderful plush rooms. Breakfast buffet was excellent.  Staff was pleasant and helpful.  A definite first choice when in Dublin.  Please walk to Stephen Green and Grafton.",5,2017,07,13
209,Premium experience,"Great hotel.  When you pay extra, you expect the small details to be addressed.  Staff at this hotel performs at all levels.  No complaints.  The hotel is a little off the beaten path, which either a plus or a minus depending on what you are looking for.",5,2017,07,10
209,Not worth the price,"I just don't see the value this hotel claims to provide for the price it wants you to pay. 

The first room had a broken AC and we had to change rooms at 1 am. A note from a manager on the next day would've been nice or a bottle of wine would've been good or some Hilton points would've been great. But none of these things happened and thats just bad service and shows no respect for my time and the inconvenience of changing rooms past midnight due completely to a hotel maintenance issue.

The new room had several ""male-made"" sticky stains around the toilet and 2 long hair pieces in the shower tub. At this point I just wanted to go to sleep and didn't want to change rooms anymore. When the room was cleaned the second night of my stay, the stains were still there. This is unacceptable for a 5 stars hotel.

Internet was slow and had a weak signal in my room. I don't believe I received premium internet speed as I should have based on diamond Hilton status.

I inquired about the complimentary cocktail with an afternoon tea offer as it relates to my bill and I was faced with a combative and defensive attitude from the front desk staff around 11 pm Saturday night when we came back to pick up our bags from storage. All I was trying to do was to understand the offer and I wasn't even debating the authenticity of the charge or implying that it should be removed. However, I felt patronized by 3 associates talking to me at the same time in a defensive tone.

Overall, the restaurant and bar staff and doormen were wondeful. But I definitely wasn't impressed with the condition of the hotel based on the 2 rooms I stayed in and management did nothing to ""make things right"" which is supposedly the Hilton promise. I wasn't upgraded automatically at check in based on availability. I did my due diligence and realized there's availability for an upgrade based on the Hilton app availability during my stay. Only when I asked and insisted that there should be upgrade availability, then I was extended a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe room from a classic room. In addition, I was not informed about breakfast hours or the hotel amenities.

The front desk staff wasn't friendly and I had a feeling that they were patronizing me during check in and check out because I'm a relatively young person compared to the rest of the guests staying in this 5 star hotel. ",4,2017,07,09
209,Helpful staff in a great location,Hotel is near several key areas for site seeing.  Great staff helped us even though we arrived early.  The rooms are well done and have multiple power outlets and even USB.  Good size bathroom and very comfortable bed.,4,2017,07,08
209,Disappointing second visit,"Upon returning to Dublin we opted to repeat our stay at the Conrad, a decision regretted shortly after checking in. We were ushered to a room on the first floor in the front of the hotel, which was undergoing construction at the entrance, this after we were assured that we would not experience any noise. 
After we moved, we were disappointed with the service in the bar, as well as the front desk...the saving grace was the wonderful attendance by our gracious room service waiter.",3,2017,07,06
209,Wonderful hotel near city center,"Service, atmosphere, and location were excellent!! Everyone went out of their way to make our stay here an exceptional one. I highly recommend staying at the Conrad. It is within walking distance to everything!",5,2017,07,06
209,"Great hotel, location is fine, staff is fantastic","Stayed here on a recent family vacation.  Good location to access the attractions of Dublin.  Great park just north of the hotel.  Ample shopping about a 10-12 minute walk north.  The hotel is very nice but no Executive Lounge yet (in process).  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was good and plenty (Diamond member so it was included).  You can order items to be made (omlette, pancakes, waffle).  There is a good pub a short walk away (NE) called O'Donoghues Bar on R138.  Good restaurants nearby.  Quiet hotel.  Would stay here again.",5,2017,07,06
209,That Time in Dublin,"I spent around two weeks in Dublin and was very much looking forward to my stay. The first day was fine-check-in went smoothly and I was even able to check-in early. Everything after that was the complete opposite. There was construction (drilling at all times of day), the staff was rude/ uninformed, frequent mistakes were made, the rooms weren't cleaned or properly stocked- all around... not a good experience.",2,2017,07,05
209,luxury,"The staff were very welcoming and attentive, the food was beautiful and tasted delicious, the recently refurbished room was a joy to relax in, pure luxury the bed was particularly comfy... we'll be back most definitely!  ",5,2017,07,05
209,Great hotel. Just close enough to the action,"This is a first rate Hilton property

Rooms have been recently redone and there are plenty of device charging opportunities in the room including USB ports and American plugs as well

Service was great

Hotel is clean and quite attractive in the common areas and the rooms

It's a little further than planned from the heart of the city but not too far to walk to anything

Great restaurant as well with a good breakfast spread. Dinner was very reasonable and delicious",5,2017,07,04
209,Dublin business trip,"Good experience and friendly staff.  Rooms very comfortable. Close proximity to park, restaurants, pubs and the central downtown Dublin district. Would definitely stay again. If tired, the restaurant in hotel is adequate for a reasonably good dinner. ",4,2017,07,04
209,Spent 3 nights here in June 2017,"Hotel has just finished a major refurbishment.  Had a Premier King Room, but room had a shower over bath.  When we enquired, we were told this was standard for rooms of this type, but an upgrade at 50 euro per night would put us in the next best room type with a walk in shower.  We declined the offer. Room was good (other than the shower issue), great bed.  Location good.  Concierge was brilliant and very helpful.  The downstairs bar and eatery was brilliant, good selection of food and drink at decent prices and very friendly staff.",4,2017,07,04
209,Great Experience,The newly remodeled hotel along with the attentive staff made for an excellent holiday! We spent 2 nights and our room was spacious and very well attended to. We also enjoyed the fitness center and restaurant.   Thank you and keep up the great work!  ,5,2017,07,04
209,Exceptional in many ways,"I noted when making reservations that we would arrive early as we would be disembarking a cruise ship that morning. Expecting to simply check in and store our luggage while we did some sightseeing, imagine how pleased we were to be told our room was ready and that we had been upgraded to one with balcony.

Everything about this hotel is five-star. Service, cleanliness, attention to detail, amenities and decor are all top notch. Its location at the edge of St Stephen's Green is also a big plus. Especially impressive was one of the most attractive breakfast buffets I have ever seen. We were very pleased in every respect, with the added enjoyment of watching three baby sea gulls on the roof just below our balcony.

This hotel should certainly please anyone looking for a great place to stay in Dublin..",5,2017,07,03
209,Great value,Stayed at the Conrad in Dublin. Rooms were nicer than the pricier hotel our friends stayed at. Great location. Staff very helpful. Easy advance booking and check out was a breeze. Free wi-fi. Lovely balcony.  ,5,2017,07,01
209,Lovely cocktails,"Good cocktails; friendly service. A lovely place to sit for an hour or two. Martinis, manhattans and old fashioneds especially recommended. If you don't have some snacks put in front of you they're having an off day",5,2017,07,01
209,Doorman TONY,"I stayed in front of the beautiful Conrad Hotel waiting the group for a day trip outside the town. But a misunderstand happenned and mr Tony, very helpfull, with no obrigation, went to see what was going on. My trip worked because him. I worked many years with hotels' companies and know the value of employee with this nature. Congratulations Conrad Hotel for keeping workers like mr Tony. Please, send my thank you to him.",5,2017,06,30
209,Excellent ,"This hotel is brilliant in every aspect,  the food, bar service...  It represents everything that Hilton stands for..  All staff genuinely seem to like working here which is unbelievably refreshing...  2 staff in particular stood out the gentleman who served us in the restaurant whos name I wish I could remember possibly Mauritian or similar and one who's name we do remember  BRENDAN who was working at night..  He left quiet an impression and we couldn't say enough good things about him so we won't even try..  Thanks for everything!!! ",5,2017,06,30
209,Excellent,"Wonderful hotel with even better staff. Bar staff were very knowledgeable and offered suggestions. Excellent accommodations and the hotel is  centrally located. Will stay here again upon my return to Dublin.
",5,2017,06,30
209,What a nightmare,"The hotel was under construction and there was heavy drilling and hammering at all times during the day. The room could not be used to sleep or work there. The staff couldn´t help. They said the problem is the same in all rooms as the noise comes through the heating system. My request for a quiet place to work was denied. The rooms were nice and clean. But that didn´t help the experience. Not acceptable at the rates they charge. The staff was friendly but not helpful at all. Breakfast was okay, nothing special.",2,2017,06,30
209,Nice traditional hotel,"Great staff, beautiful room, very comfortable bed. Nice breakfast a la carte with option for fresh smoothies : try the strawberry lactose free yummy 😋 

Easy access to the city center but quite expensive ",4,2017,06,28
209,What a pleasure,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at this beautiful hotel for 7 days. The staff was phenomenal; the accommodations excellent, and the restaurants had a good  variety of  quality food. 
The location allowed us to walk to many attractions and restaurants. 
A special thank you to John Hegerty, Front Office Manger, who repeatedly made sure our stay was enjoyable and that we had everything we needed. And to Dimitri Stroykov , Food & Beverage Manager for often checking to be sure we were enjoying our food and service.
Great Place.  Happy our friends suggested it and when we go back it will again be our Dublin base.",5,2017,06,28
209,Beautiful Hotel,We stayed three nights at the Conrad Dublin and would highly recommend it.  It is steps from the Airlink stop from the airport which was the cheapest way to get into the city.  The room was very nice and the breakfast was supurb.  The staff was most helpful with plans and arrangements.  The location was close to St. Stephens Green Park and close to the main shopping on Grafton Street.  We liked everything about our stay at the Conrad.,5,2017,06,28
209,Upscale and good locale,"Nice accommodation and excellent location.  We could walk to the Temple Bar area which has many pubs and good restaurants.  The hotel is also quite near St. Stephens Green which is great for people watching, relaxing, or picnicking.",4,2017,06,28
209,Exceeded expectations,"The Conrad Dublin is first rate.  Service couldn't be better.  The staff was gracious and accommodated our requests for early check-in, which was greatly appreciated.  The room was spacious, quiet, and comfortable. Also, the location is excellent. Most attractions were within walking distance.",5,2017,06,27
209,"Great location, nice property","I spent 3 nights at the Conrad in Dublin recently.  The location of the hotel near St Stephen's Green is convenient for walking access to many restaurants and shopping.

My room was spacious, bright, and clean.  It was quiet throughout the night.

Breakfast was decent with a good pot of french press coffee.  The bar/lounge (Lemuels) was a nice options for a quick bite.  

I'll definitely stay here again.",5,2017,06,26
209,Not Enough Stars for the Conrad!,"Just spent 5 nights in Dublin, staying at the famed Conrad Dublin; a top destination place to stay when in Dublin. Everything about this property has excellence written all over it. The Bell Staff was helpful, friendly, and always asking to assist, the Front Desk staff was professional, friendly, and asked what they could do to make our stay better. The restaurant staff, across the board, was great, and the food at this lovely hotel makes it easy to stay in and not walk around the downtown area, if that is what one wanted to do. The Conrad Dublin is on my ""must return"" list and I will not wait a very long time. The Irish folks are wonderful, warm, people that I truly enjoy being around. Thanks Conrad Dublin for making our stay even nicer than ever expected.",5,2017,06,26
209,Unbelievable! Couldn't have asked for more.,"We reserved the King Suite as our so was travelling with us. The room was the size of a one bedroom apartment in NYC! Our room was ready when we arrived, with the sofa-bed open and made with extravagant linens and a quilted mattress pad. Upon returning to the room after our day out, we found a bottle of wine and a celebratory tray of cookies both for my son for high school graduation and my husband for his birthday. Every area of the hotel was spotless and the restaurant and lounge staff were as wonderful as the food.",5,2017,06,26
209,Excellent Hotel,The hotel is in an excellent location within walking distance of all sites and sounds of Dublin; the team were brilliant ... friendly and efficient. The hotel has also been recently refurbished throughout so looks and feels brilliant !,5,2017,06,26
209,Excellent location and great staff,"Conrad staff are so helpful and friendly, My luggage was delayed and they could not have done more to help.  Wonderful location in the centre of Dublin, near to all the main tourist sites.   Highly recommended.",5,2017,06,26
209,Exceptional stay,"Cannot give this hotel anything but superlatives.  Staff, room, location, you name it.  Arrived about 6:30 A.M. and room was ready.  Staff was helpful in recommending restaurants, etc.  (I usually am suspicious of such recommendations but this one was great.)   Spend some time in the bar and ask for Hannah.",5,2017,06,26
209,Post-exam trip ,"I have just finished exam season and my this was my mum's destination of choice for a relaxing weekend away together. The hotel is simply wonderful with excellent service, very comfortable rooms, and the top quality of the restaurant means you don't even need to leave the hotel!! ",5,2017,06,24
209,Pleasant hotel,I stayed at this hotel when there was some renovations happening. My room was in a location which was quite noisy so a little disappointing. Also i heard a lot of outdoor noise. The room was nice and pleasant and spacious.  The staff were friendly.  The breakfast was great.,3,2017,06,24
209,Excellent Hotel in Dublin!,"My wife and I were celebrating our 20th anniversary in Ireland. We stayed five nights at the Conrad due to a great offer they had for a fifth night free. Their staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful for anything I needed. The rooms were spacious enough with a sitting chair next to a modern desk. The desk had outlets for any location you are coming from, so the converters we brought were not needed. The breakfast in the morning had a ton of selections, with delicious meats, fruits/veggies, yogurts and breads. This always gave us a great start to whatever was on our itinerary for that day. The location was iseal being close to St. Stephens Green, and most attractions were within walking distance or a quick Uber or taxi ride away. It costs 20 Euro/night to park your car in the underground lot, but it was a very safe area. 

I would highly recommend this hotel if you want to be pampered and treated right. ",5,2017,06,23
209,A 'post make-over ' impression,"Stayed here in May for 3 nights for my 74th birthday. Prior to the hotel being refurbished, I had been a guest at the Conrad on a number of occasions over the years,  and had always enjoyed my time there. Prior to the recent renovations, I had a 'falling out' with Hilton/Conrad over their wifi charges, and because of the hotel failing to advise me that its restaurant would be closed for re-decoration.

However, I decided to give the Conrad another chance, and made bookings for May.

Good points:-

a) refurbishment overall  is tasteful, thorough and unobtrusive - guest rooms  are now top rate in terms of furniture, decor, lighting and ambience

 b) staff are still uniquely pleasant, courteous and helpful - without exception.

 c) the meals that I had in my room were of a good standard.

 d) pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a deluxe room.

 e) on arrival in my room, two birthday cards and some chocolates from the manager 
     were waiting for me : a lovely touch which was much appreciated.

f) AC was excellent

Not so good points:-

a) room wifi arrangements very unsatisfactory - system seems to shut down at night, and has to be reset on a daily basis : irritating and frustrating in a supposedly 5* hotel.

b) took two friends to dinner in the restaurant : food was somewhat 'minimalist' : not really what one expects for €170, excluding wine and coffee. 

c) breakfast selection not as varied as prior to the restaurant refurbishment. Breakfast buffet didn't include mushrooms or scrambled eggs as standard !

d) nothing in my mini-bar, except a bottle of water - why?!

But a most pleasant stay, all in all. I shall continue to stay at the Conrad during my visits to Dublin.",4,2017,06,22
209,Family vacation,"My family stayed here for 6 nights on a vacation.  I agree with some of the other comments about this hotel being geared more towards business, but it was still an overall good experience.  The concierge was very friendly, helpful and knowledgable.  One bit of advice for vacationing families, don't buy the hotel breakfasts.  It's overpriced and there are numerous cafes and coffee shops within easy walking distance.  Much less expensive and more fun.  

Also, the view from our room was the back end of an office building.  If that matters to you, mention it when booking.  It appears that they may consider rooms with a decent view  an 'upgrade' and charge extra.",4,2017,06,21
209,True Hospitality ,Stayed with family earlier this year and from arrival to departure they took such good care of us. Love the new rooms and ground floor. Best breakfast we have had in Dublin-set us up for the day.  We had afternoon tea in Lemuels and it was such a delight.  So easy to get around Dublin - our car was parked for us and we didn't need it or think about it until we left. Thank you for a great stay. We look forward to our next visit! ,5,2017,06,21
209,"Fancy Hotel, with all the pluses and minuses of that","Fancy hotel in every respect, but it wasn't a perfect fit for us.  The food was unexpectedly constrained and the location is a 15-minute walk from the shopping and tour bus stops.  It's probably a better hotel for business travelers than for tourists.

There's a really convenient pub in the basement with a great menu.  The first time we sat down nobody would serve us, so we changed tables.  The next day we sat down again and nobody would serve us. So we flagged someone down and were disappointed to learn that they stop selling food at 9pm except for pizza. So we went upstairs to the fancier restaurant, where they had food but would not sell us the pizza.  If you're paying $500 per night (high season!), the pub ought to serve food past 9pm, or if you want pizza in the restaurant they ought to serve you pizza.  I think.

Everybody is super-nice, although the corporate-ness overwhelms the extroverted Irish exuberance that we encountered elsewhere on our stay. 

I wasn't disappointed, but I would look elsewhere if I came back.",4,2017,06,20
209,Could do more,Hotel air conditioning was not very good. lots of people dressed up and the heat in the room made it very uncomfortable  ventilation in our bathroom was not good.  The quality of the beer served in the function room was not up to standard.,3,2017,06,20
209,Excellent stay,"Hi,  We attended an awards night in the Conrad. We had seven rooms booked. The service was excellent and we were all very happy with our stay. The food was excellent, especially breakfast. The location is also excellent. It's in the heart of Dublin City Centre.",5,2017,06,20
209,Wonderful experience,"A really classy place. Rooms are freshly updated and beautiful. Service was impeccable. Breakfast was just fine. Dinner in restaurant was excellent and fairly priced.   Location is just off the busiest places in Dublin, so there is good access but not so much noise. ",5,2017,06,19
209,Great spot,Very close to St. Stephen's Green and Gafton street.  Nice rooms as well.  The hotel staff was very helpful with directions and suggestions on where to go.  Overall my husband and I had a great stay.  No complaints.  ,5,2017,06,19
209,Amazing hotel,"The twin room booked was spacious and with lot of amenities. I liked in particular the nespresso machine. 
I enjoyed my stay and everything was nice. Room, restaurant, breakfast, staff. I stayed just one night but I wish to come back one day to stay longer. 
Extremely recommended to everyone",5,2017,06,18
209,Excellent,"One of the better hotels I stayed at. Extra clean and comfortable bed, an espresso coffeemaker, great shower - and to top a great breakfast in the restaurant at the lobby.
The location is also brilliant - near a small park and 10m walk to the pubs.
Will definitely stay there next time!",5,2017,06,18
209,Price valu did not match,Air conditioner did not perform as I wanted ..... by a lot.   The price value ecuation was not to my satisfaction and too noise from other rooms.     Breakfast also pretty limited.    I will not gi back.   I hope,3,2017,06,18
209,SO DISSAPOINTED,Had high expectations for this place unfortunately I was let down big time!! Check in staff were far from satisfactory but the big let down was breakfast. The staff were all over the place it was crazy! Believe it or not the actually ran out of CUPS and GLASSES! Guests don't just appear out of no where they knew how many people were staying in the hotel that would be coming for breakfast. On check out the staff said this happens all the time! Definitely not worth the money we spent! Stay away! ,2,2017,06,18
209,noisy...noisy...noisy!!!,"Even though we paid $700 per night for the Junior Suite, I guess when you book through a travel site, you can expect the worst room. The room was one floor up from the lobby and the noise never stopped until the wee hours. During the day there was construction being done on the building.  The hotel attempted to find interior rooms but  none were available so they comped a dinner. Good for them. But we would have been better off at a lesser hotel than the Conrad with two rooms for the price and a good nights sleep. Be careful. Miserable sleepless experience.",3,2017,06,17
209,More lows than highs,"This place really needs to pull up it's socks! The service from the restaurant staff borders on offensive An an example... at breakfast there is no toaster so you need to ask a member of staff to do that for you, simple right? Well no, the staff walk around with their heads down so you can't make eye contact. Once I hailed someone she took the bread away and 30min later there was still no toast. We gave up and left. We complained on the first day at reception in the hope that things would improve... but it was in vain. The service (or lack thereof rather) was the same for the remaining three days. As for the Alfie Byrne public bar, this was a disgrace - zero customer service!! Once you get served you are treated like you owe them a favour for actually serving you, I can't even describe how bad this bar is - avoid!
Another annoying point is everyday we had to get our room keys validated, you need the key to access the floor in the elevator, that works then you get to your room and the key doesn't work. When you return to reception to get the standard response "" have you had the key near your phone?"" I know you don't put the key near your phone and always keep it in a different pocket, but to get the question four days in a row after you say this is everyday is insulting.

On the positive side the rooms were spotlessly clean ... the housekeeping staff could actually teach the front of house staff a real lesson in customer awareness. A few exceptions in the front of house, Isabella from Lemuels Bar and Deepu from reception.
Also it is strange not to have an executive lounge in a Conrad. As a hiltonhonors diamond member I've used many in the Conrad range and this is the worst by far.",1,2017,06,17
209,Disappointed,"For 300 euro per night, maybe I expect too much. Maybe we caught them at a bad time. The rooms were nice, and the location was good. My biggest problem was the disinterested staff. We were pleased Sky Sports was on our TV so we could see the US Open. Around 20:30 a message came on the TV that Sky would go off in 2 minutes for inactivity. I called the operator, no answer. Called the front desk twice, no answer (hope we don't have an emergency). My wife went downstairs, and they said they would send someone right up to look at our TV. 20 minutes later we called the front desk and they answered!! They said they would have to reset Sky for the hotel. Two minutes later it was on. Two hours later it went out.......I surrender.",2,2017,06,17
209,Great Service...Fabulous Location,"Spent two nights in the lap of luxury...Friendly efficient staff made us feel very welcome.  Perfect location to see all the sites and easy access from airport.  Due to lack of executive lounge the front desk agent provided free breakfast, nice touch!

Definitely recommend the Conrad!",5,2017,06,16
209,First class!,We only stayed one night but wished we'd had more time. This hotel is first class from the courteous and professional check in staff to the pristine rooms with gorgeous curtains and very comfortable beds and pillows!  ,5,2017,06,16
209,Very nice hotel,"Stayed here for a weekend break, I booked a room with a view. Unfortunately all we got was a view of buildings behind the hotel, I queried this at reception to be informed that the highest floor was being renovated, I wish hotels would let you know of issues up front and not leave it for you to complain. Anyway as a diamond member we were upgraded and room was great, so much so we ordered room service instead of trying to find somewhere and it was excellent, hot food served with a nice bottle of red.
Breakfast is the best we have had, huge choice and Plenty of it",4,2017,06,16
209,"Beautiful Hotel, great location. Walking distance to all Dublin sights. No need for car.","Terrific hotel, great location. Walking distance through gorgeous Park, St. Stephen's Green, to Graphton St.. Walking distance to Trinity College and old pubs ... to all Dublin sights. No need for car.",5,2017,06,14
209,Great time in Dublin in a perfect location at the Conrad,"Perfect location for exploring Dublin on foot.  St Stephens Green park and Grafton road are minutes away.  We spent three nights and enjoyed the easy walks through Trinity college grounds, the GPO on the north side of the Liffy, over the Half-Penny bridge into the Temple Bar and then back to the Conrad on Grafton.  Next day, we had lunch in town and hiked over to the Guinness store house for self-guided tour and a couple of cool ones in the Gravity bar.  The Conrad's location and helpful staff made our short stay in Dublin a great way to start our visit back home this year.  ",5,2017,06,14
209,Excellent service,"I received a very good service at the Conrad. The only thing I might remark is that the breakfast can be a bit hectic. I had to leave one morning without coffee because the staff had forgotten, probably due to this. ",4,2017,06,14
209,Comfort & Quality at its Best,"Took my family to Dublin Ireland to enjoy a getaway, regroup and spend time together after my wive's recent passing. It couldn't have worked out better. Initially I had hoped to find a less expensive hotel but after the stay there, it will be my only choice when I visit Dublin. I can't remember staying in a hotel I liked better. I almost didn't want to come home. Thank you Conrad Dublin.",5,2017,06,12
209,Close to the old city and parks,"From checkin to check out, the staff were more than obliging. The room was bright and spacious. The bathroom was warm and large. I couldn't encourage the coffee machine to work, but everything else was perfect. Cleanliness was well above average. The icing on the cake were the breakfasts. Bliss!",4,2017,06,12
209,This hotel needs work!,"We stayed at this hotel one the last stop of a Tauck tour of Ireland and it was the only poor choice.  The hotel is not very attractive but that's not the main problem.  Water pressure was poor, tub/shower combo very hard to get in and out of, small couch in the room was too tiny for 2 people and the service was lacking.  I had to call 3 times to get a cork screw.  The only bright spot was Macin at the front desk.  He assisted us with restaurant recommendations and tickets and seemed to know a lot about Dublin while others did not.  Location was also not ideal.  The Westin would be a better choice for location.",2,2017,06,11
209,Fabulous,"The hotel has a fabulous and helpful staff. The staff will go out of their way for you. Within walking distance for attractions and shopping. Lovely rooms. Very nice. Great breakfast buffet. Very quiet. 
",5,2017,06,10
209,"Expensive, but nice hotel","I have been staying in the Conrad for years, but not been there much recently, so was delighted to go back in May 2017. Amazing to see that the concierge staff are still the same and they remembered me. Nice touch. The rooms have recently been renovated and are very nice, but strangely the room doors seem to be the old ones that do not close very easily. Car park under the hotel is very convenient and they do not charge for it. Coffee area comfortable and the new restaurant looks good, even though I did not eat there as there are so many options close by.",5,2017,06,08
209,You can always count on Hilton properties,"Husband and I stayed for last two nights of a week long trip in Ireland.  Booked the Conrad as a last minute decision, and I was very happy I did.  Great location, beautiful room, and the outstanding Hilton service and quality I have come to expect and appreciate all over the world.",5,2017,06,06
209,Unobtrusive Intelligent Caring service,"My brother, his wife and my two nieces( 11 and 13) came to stay at the Conrad recently. I was deputised to mind them for four days and to show them my native city. My brother and his wife work in the pharmeceutical industry and were working 10 hour days researcjhing a new drug. I arrive on the first morning and asked that the front desk ring the room where my nieces were sleeping off their jet lag. I explained that I was Uncle Johnnie and that I woud be taking care of them in the daytime. The dark skinned gentleman assisitng me suggested that I take a seat and a newspaper and that he would try the room a few further times. He rang the room,  eventually got my nieces, and asked them who would be minding them for the next few days. They named and described me. I greatly appreciated  his subtle care for their welfare. This professional kindliness extended to large and little courtesies during the stay. In particular a young male  concierge who waived a car park fee when I was obviously in a hurry, a zimbabwean waitress in your breakfast room who was charming in listening to my brother's reminisinces  about his time in rhodesia and shared her own feelings and concerns for her homeland. Every request to all staff we encountered was met with a cheerful "" can do"" response. This is what really typifies a magnificent hotel and makes using it a pleasure that one is eager to repeat.",5,2017,06,05
209,Perfect stay in Dublin,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Conrad Hotel in Dublin, the room we stayed in was a Premier King with balcony and it was beautifully decorated and luxurious, we booked this room because of the balcony and the high ceilings and it was the best room I've ever stayed in. It's location close to St. Stephen's Green and Grafton St was a real bonus. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful, everything about our stay was perfect.",5,2017,06,05
209,Luxury hotel in a great location!,"We arrived just before lunchtime and was pleasantly surprised to find our room was ready. Staff were very helpful - concierge, dining room - all made our stay a very pleasant one. The hotel itself is just a short stroll through St Stephens Green to Grafton St - approx 10 minutes - and from here the city centre is your oyster! Dublin is a beautiful, vibrant city and we loved our 3nights in it! Our room was very comfortable with a large bathroom, king size bed and the black out curtains were an added bonus. 
The hotel lobby was undergoing construction work which made for a noisy and messy entrance (the entrance/exit changed sides during our stay) but it did not cause us any problems because we were placed on an upper floor away from any noise.
We were in Dublin to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and if we were to mention something that could have made our stay even more pleasant it would be that the hotel had acknowledged this - I had mentioned it when making the reservation - however we still enjoyed our stay and would definitely return to the Conrad!",5,2017,06,04
209,An excellent study in a fab renovated hotel . Staff are well trained and attentive.  Breakfast is a treat,Treat yourself and stay here.  Close to shopping and all good restaurants . Free parking and internet with excellent staff and new bedrooms.   Pure luxury. Do try lemuls cocktails.  Best in Dublin.  Food in Alfie's is a must along with 30 craft beers!,5,2017,06,04
209,Conrad Dublin,One of our favorite hotels in the world!  Conveniently located to allow us to walk to the city center. The hotel and staff are awesome!  The newly renovated rooms are top notch!  Food is awesome as is the service. ,5,2017,06,04
209,Great staff and convenient Dublin location ,"I recently stayed at the Conrad Dublin, and found that the staff could not have been any nicer.  They front desk and concierge continuously made restaurant  reservations /recommendations for us. They even booked a few passes for tours. In the evening they would take down what time we wanted a cab in the morning, and make sure one was waiting for us when we arrived in the lobby and sometimes with a coffee. 

The location was good.  Right across the street from the national concert hall, close to some decent restaurants, and right off of St. Stephens Green. Opposite Side of Grafton street but only a short walk through the park to get there

The bed itself was very comfortable, and had a nesppresso machine in the room.  However, for a newly renovated hotel I thought the rooms would have been a a touch nicer. There was nothing wrong with it, but overall I thought it was a little plain. 

I would recommend staying here as it is very close to where you want to be, and the staff are great. ",4,2017,06,03
209,Loved it!,Fabulous hotel! Beautiful place and excellent service. Arrived at 10am and they had a wonderful room for us at 10:15 - far earlier than we were expecting! Staff was very warm and friendly - exactly what we expected! Close to everything (walking) but away from the street noise! Loved every minute. ,5,2017,06,03
209,Luxury!,"I'm a Diamond member & they treated me like a King.  Upon arrival I parked my car illegally due to construction at the entrance to the hotel.  The porter asked for my car keys; parked my car & brought in my bags....so nice.  I was upgraded to a Premium Room which is lovely.  The bars, restaurant, fitness center etc is excellent.  I also went for a run; there's a beautiful park just across the street.  It's what you expect from a Conrad.",5,2017,06,03
209,Great City Location,"Lovely , comfortable hotel in a great location on St. Stephen's Green Dublin.  Walking distance to most attractions and restaurants. Friendly and helpful staff.  Very comfortable bed. Concierge helped with booking tour bus.  Thought breakfast was overpriced, but many other options nearby.",5,2017,06,02
209,Nice hotel in the heart of town,Solid front desk staff.  Bar and restaurant staff were helpful.   Hotel is in a great location.  A number of things to do close by and a lot of restaurants in walking spdistance.  Room was clean and quiet.  I would return.,4,2017,05,30
209,So disappointed in the noise,This was our third time staying at the Conrad Dublin and the previous two stays were spectacular.  Unfortunately one of the rooms our family received was not the place to rest after a transatlantic flight due to construction.  The staff were friendly and helpful except with this matter since the hotel was full.  I would not recommend staying during this period.,2,2017,05,30
209,"Lovely hotel, looks all new and beautifully decorated throughout.","The furnishings in this hotel are stunning.  the common space and our hotel room was exquisite  
The breakfast was also very very good, and we had pate and lobster bisque in the bar that was good as well..  ",5,2017,05,30
209,Hospitality!," Wonderful greeting by staff, and more hospitality throughout this day. Food was excellent in the restaurant, and very convenient parking garage. Beds  were  extremely comfortable, clean and fluffy!  Clean, simple, elegant decor.   Nice location. ",5,2017,05,29
209,Excellent service,"This is a beautiful hotel that excels in customer service. Nothing was too much trouble, and often the staff would anticipate our needs and attention to detail was amazing. In a great location and we particularly enjoyed the wonderful breakfast. A delightful stay - we will definately be returning to our favourite hotel!",5,2017,05,29
209,Excellent services & Comfortable room,"Both I and my cousin stayed in Conrad Dublin for our 5 days vacation in Dublin. Thumbs-up for the excellent services and clean comfortable room! The front desk reception staff are all very friendly. We received some exceptionally wonderful services from Francisco who has been very helpful to attend to our queries. Breakfast was terrific, we look forward to the daily breakfast specials! They even prep breakfast on days when our day tours start before the breakfast hours! The hotel's wi-fi didn't work for us (we were provided with a set of instruction at check-in) but we didn't pursue since we purchase data SIM card at the airport already. As for location, I love it for its-close proximity to St Stephen's Green park -- love the daily strolls!! -- I will choose Conrad Dublin again if I'm back for another visit!",5,2017,05,29
209,Comfort in the city,We were staying in Dublin for a work event based in the Conrad. It was made very easy by the attentive staff who went above the call of duty to ensure we were well catered for. We were well looked after and all the needs were  met. The rooms were very comfortable and food was appetising and tasty.,4,2017,05,27
209,Beautiful renovated hotel.  Large rooms and new bathrooms.  Very comfortable beds. Location is great.   Very GF friendly,Stayed here in May for business and really is one of the loveliest hotels in Europe I have stayed at.  Very gluten free friendly for those like me who have Celiac. Must say the buckwheat pancakes are worth the stay.  Slept like a dream in the very comfortable bed.  My choice hotel in Dublin.  ,5,2017,05,27
209,Our honeymoon,The hotel staff was very friendly and the hotel is really beautiful. The breakfast was really good and the pub downstairs was really nice. The location of the hotel is perfect. Everything is in walking distance or short cab ride away. Perfect for our honeymoon.,5,2017,05,27
209,Amazing hotel,"The nicest hotel I have ever stayed in and the food there is amazing. Staff are so welcoming and friendly, very helpful aswel. It's not far from the city, only a short walk and it's right beside st Stephens green",5,2017,05,24
209,Straight forward service with everything not quite in order,"Front desk and doorman gave polite and good service despite the work that was going on. However the air conditioning unit did not work and despite seeking assistance there was no response.
The buffet breakfast was a bit of a shambles and very bland. Very disappointing.

Stayed for business this week. Air conditioning again not working.",3,2017,05,24
209,Wedding anniversary,Enjoyed a nice stay at this hotel with my wife for 3 nights.  Was welcomed with great service and the gentleman at the check-in counter gave us a complimentary room upgrade based on our 5-year wedding anniversary which we were extremely grateful for. Due to mix-up of our booking we also got free breakfast included which was great as breakfast is very expensive at this hotel.  Breakfast was good but nothing less than expected from a 5-star hotel. Location is passable and close to Grafton street however it is a long walk when discovering the North side of the Liffey.  Other positives: - extremely nice personnel overall - nicely decorated rooms and clean bathroom - big flat screen in room  Negatives: - some noise from streets during nighttime - poor selection of bread for breakfast - best movie channels did not work  All in all a great stay and would probably stay here again if the price is not too high.,4,2017,05,24
209,Nice but nothing special to justify price,"This is a nice hotel in a good location.  Staff very friendly, rooms great and clean. Depends on what you're staying for really, I was only here one night and personally would pay less and not notice anything different.  My only gripe with the hotel is I had about a 15 minute wait to be seated for breakfast. Not sure what the delay was, probably just understaffed but I've paid a lot less for the same standard in room and facilities and not had to wait 15 minutes to get a table and eat (there were lots of free tables). Overall ok bit not worth the price ",3,2017,05,23
209,"Vacation in Dublin, IE","For a real relaxing hotel experience away from home, this has been one of our best.  Staff is very helpful and knowledgeable about the hotel and spots around the city to visit as a family.  Care has been taken to make our stay as enjoyable as possible.",5,2017,05,23
209,Wonderful stay,"Hotel is located in quiet part of downtown Dublin yet within walking distance to St Stephen's Green, Trinity College and dining venues.  Service was wonderful.     The lounge was surprisingly busy based on my experience traveling for business.  On a Friday night it was packed with patrons.",5,2017,05,23
209,Hotel Conrad Dublin,"Always a wonderful experience staying here. Great location, great food, great rooms and great service. I'm top tier loyalty scheme in three hotel chains, I spend 200+ nights per year in hotels on business but I always enjoy this hotel the most.",5,2017,05,23
209,Comfort and style,"The Conrad in Dublin is a beautifully presented, stylish hotel a short walk away from the city centre. The rooms are clean and immaculate with lovely stylish touches. The breakfast is awesome. The staff were super friendly and helpful. Only downside: The gym is somewhat small and lacks facilities.",5,2017,05,22
209,"Beautiful, centrally located hotel.","The Conrad Dublin is in a great, centrally located area of Dublin, within easy walking distance of major attractions.  A current ongoing renovation in the front lobby reception area is a little bit distracting, but the area is easily negotiated to reach the front desk area.  The morning breakfast is excellent, with an inviting buffet, with options to order from the menu.  The room we stayed in was quiet, even though the room faced the road outside the front of the hotel.  The staff are very welcoming and professional!  Overall, an excellent hotel choice for our visit to Dublin!",5,2017,05,22
209,Perfect location,Close enough to walk to city centre but far enough to be away from the crowd. Great service and great breakfast were added bonuses. We returned for a second stay at the end of our UK/Europe road trip.,5,2017,05,22
209,Dream trip,The rooms have been renovated and are beautiful!  And the breakfast included with our room was amazing and delicious.  The staff was friendly and helpful! We will definitely be back for another stay when in Dublin!,5,2017,05,21
209,Nice rooms convenient location,"Lovely refreshed rooms and very helpful staff
Nice and quiet and across from park 
Nice touch with trail for running cards left in room
Nice hotel restayrant with good menu choice which had small plates and great wine menu",4,2017,05,21
209,Lovely place to enjoy Christmas ,Had a stunning Christmas here. Third in a row. Santa is great for the kids. He comes along during dinner. They love it. Food is great. No wifi in the rooms which was a pity as we were trying to Skype friends and family on Christmas Day. Lovely hotel to relax in and enjoy the proximity to the city centre. ,5,2017,05,21
209,Upscale Effort but,"Selected by group tour, convenient middle of town location, lots of attractions nearby, reception very good, restaurant/bars are very good ""Coburg"" soups and onion rings exceptional, standard rooms-clean, nicely appointed, bathroom tubs are difficult to get in and out of, reception wine tasting before dinner was nice in a very sterile room, service folks very friendly, prompt, and helpful, arrangements for transport to airport were excellent, refreshment offerings in room nicely provided, comp breakfast extensive.",4,2017,05,20
209,A most enjoyable stay.,"Arrived at this hotel as stage four of a tour around Ireland. Check in was done electronically in advance, but upon arrival, we were immediately upgraded to a Junior Suite, there being more room for me, a wheelchair user. Reception and Concierge staff extremely polite, helpful and efficient, as were the bar and waiting staff. The room itself was excellent, luxurious and large, with all mod cons, inc. Nespresso coffee maker and iPod/iPhone dock. Bar staff went out of their way to try and locate a supplier for their fantastic 'Poachers Premium Irish Tonic' which was to die for. 
Location of hotel, very close to St Stephen's Green, was ideal for walking into the centre of Dublin. 
Personally we found the hotel a little expensive to the extent that we ate out the majority of the time, inc. breakfast. That said, it is our intention to return and re-visit Dublin and I would certainly want to stay at the Conrad Dublin again. I would highly recommend this hotel to others.",5,2017,05,17
209,Excellent but pricey,"The Conrad is a 5-star hotel with a matching price. For the most part it lives up to it. The rooms are large and very nicely decorated, with all the standard amenities. The wifi is reliable, I was able to print out what I needed to in the business centre without being charged extra. The breakfast was splendid. Somebody else was paying for it. Would I pay for this amount if I was looking for a hotel in Dublin? Maybe not.",4,2017,05,17
209,Nice hotel in a great location!,"This is a beautiful, contemporary hotel and only a short walk to St. Stephen's Green or Trinity College,  The rooms are clean and well appointed.  The beds are extremely comfortable and the rooms are soundproof making for a restful night's sleep in the heart of the city.  The breakfast buffet is nice or you can order from the menu.  Dinner in the restaurant was excellent!  The staff is exceptionally accommodating and helpful.  All around great stay!",5,2017,05,16
209,First visit to Ireland,"We found the Irish are very friendly and go out of their way to help.  Literally, every person we me in three days were the same, friendly people.  We took an Extreme Ireland day tour to Cliffs of Mohr with Alec as tour guide, and on separate day,a day tour to the Giant Causeway and Belfast with John.  Both were exceptional tours led by seasoned, knowledgeable, personable tour guides.",5,2017,05,16
209,Could be so much better,"A newly refurbished room was reserved but alas on arrival not available. The room was offered was dated and paint chipped. Also the windows did not open.  

Breakfast was very good but service slow and a long queue formed for guests to be seated.

The bar staff were excellent and efficient however on check out drinks had been charged to our room but not ours even though it listed clearly the name of the guest on the bar bill.  If checks had been done at input stage error would have been spotted.

The hotel location is the highlight of this hotel, Grafton street and the Green are a short stroll away.",3,2017,05,16
209,GOOD CHOICE.....................................,"Located near Trinity College and St. Steven Green, this is a good choice for exploring Dublin. 
Modernized, stately hotel with friendly service, clean well maintained rooms, restaurants and bars. 
Part of the Hilton organization, so it attracts an international cliental.",4,2017,05,16
209,Lovely stay at the Conrad Dublin hotel,"Our stay was lovely, the staff was always kind and helpful. The room was very clean, the bed and pillows were amazing and comfortable!! I recommend staying here. Very well located near shops and city centre of course :)",5,2017,05,16
209,Lovely stay.,"The staff at the Conrad are second to none.  Front desk, concierge staff and housekeeping all fantatic .  We stayed just shy of a week in March with two teens in seperate rooms and it was excellent.
fantastic location, comfort etc all top notch.  

The only negative would be the construction noise.  That is a temporary issue mind you and the upgrades are worth it.   Would stay again without question.  Honestly the staff is truly fabulous",4,2017,05,15
209,Beautiful Hotel With Amazing Breakfast,"This is by far one of the best Hiltons I have stayed around the world. It's nicely furnished with a very comfortable bed. Everything had an understated elegance to it including linens and furnishings. The staff is very friendly and the breakfast spread is amazing. However, It was a bit expensive.",5,2017,05,15
209,Top Notch Service,"Amazing staff, beautiful facilities, great location. Staff extremely accommodating! Very centrally located from popular sites. Clean, current rooms including a variety of power outlet options.  Overall , awesome experience!",5,2017,05,15
209,Great hotel. Very central.,Stayed here in early May. Great location. Nice residents bar for late night cocktails. Excellent service. Also part of the Hilton family so you can get points or use them for your stay. Really enjoyed our stay. Definitely would recommend!,5,2017,05,15
209,Extremely Impressed,"As a Hilton employee for the top hotel in my home town I set the bar extremely high and am usually left feeling slightly underwhelmed at the level of service at other properties.  This, however, was not the case for my brief stay at the Conrad in Dublin. 

Louise, at the front desk, welcomed us in with a genuine warmth and hospitable nature. At check in she gave us a brief run down of the hotel including the various on-site amenities and later provided us with a map of the area including various bars and restaurants within walking distance.  

After getting settled in, my friends and I had the opportunity to enjoy a few drinks and a bite to eat at Lemuel's. We were immediately welcomed in by Daniel who went above and beyond by writing down a detailed list of all the places in the area he would recommend to us as well, even including why.  

To top it all off, the restaurant manager (didn't catch his name) gave us the history of a few of the local spirits they offer and once he found out it was my friends anniversary he surprised them with a special treat! 

The level of service and hospitality from the entire Conrad Dublin team left me feeling obligated to write a good review. Thank you to everyone for providing us with such a memorable experience!!",5,2017,05,14
209,Redeemed itself!,"We visited the conrad about 2 years ago, and had a horrific experience however returned now and had a fantastic stay. The hotel has been renovated in the past year and looks amazing! Everything has been redone and they did an outstanding job! Very friendly and welcoming staff (Thank you once again gary) + amazing hospitality at work nowadays! The conrad dublin has definately redeemed itself, especially with the addititonal energy that was done in order to reover their service, and will see us back when we visit dublin again! ",5,2017,05,14
209,One of my absolutely favorite hotels anywhere,"I've been to Ireland on 4 occasions, and have stayed at the Conrad Dublin on 3 of those occasions (2002, 2015, and 2016). The location is absolutely great, as they are located across from the National Concert Hall, and a half block from St. Stephen's Green. Both express bus services to the airport stop within a block of the hotel. The entire front desk staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. The hotel managers are wonderful people. Their breakfast buffet is truly outstanding. They offer a great selection of tasty food, and friendly, attentive service. As you enter the hotel lobby, you are transformed from the liveliness of the streets of Dublin to a relatively quiet, warm, friendly, comfortable oasis. The rooms are very clean and very comfortable, enabling a great night's sleep. Yet the streets of Dublin are just outside the entrance door. You can walk across St. Stephen's Green to the Grafton Street shopping district in about 7 to 10 minutes, depending on the traffic lights. The cost of this experience is on the higher side, but I believe it's worth the investment, and I highly recommend the Conrad Dublin. I will return here to stay each and every time I come back to Dublin.",5,2017,05,14
209,Eureka,"If your looking for a property to stay at with the friendliest service and the most sumptious beds, look no further than the Conrad! From the moment we arrived until check out, the staff were so attentive and made us feel very welcome.  Dinner in the very smart 'Coburg' resturant on both nights was delicious and the bar was a great place to relax afterward. Our room was an elegant delight with truly the most amazingly comfortable bed ever!!  We would like to thank the Conrad and staff for a fabulous weekend experience, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",5,2017,05,13
209,Nice Hotel but some problems,"This was my 3rd visit to Dublin and the 3rd hotel where I've stayed while in Dublin.  The rooms are very good with comfortable beds, a nice bath and good amenities.  Our tour group of 105 people arrived on a bank holiday and there was only one elevator in service.  Management explained they couldn't get the other fixed because of the holiday but if you have 105 people arriving at one time, you should find some way to get it operating!  As a result, there were long waits just to get to our room.  In a hotel this size, I would think they would have more than 2 elevators.  We ate in the hotel restaurant one night of our stay and the service was not good although the food was OK.  We had to wait quite a while for the check and then there were errors.  Breakfast was adequate but certainly not as good as one would expect from a hotel of this class.  A major problem for the women was trying to find a place to use the hair dryer!  There was no plug in the bath - probably a safety concern - and no mirror in the bedroom where there would have been a plug.  The only solution was to plug the hair dryer into the plug where the coffee pot was located across a narrow hall from a full length mirror and try to use the hair dryer from the rear.  Obviously a woman was not consulted when they designed the rooms!  I gave it 4 stars because the rooms are clean and well-appointed and the location is excellent but if you're expecting a 5 star experience, the Conrad is not the place.",4,2017,05,12
209,WEEKEND OF LUXURY,My husband booked this as a surprise 50th Birthday trip and I was not disappointed.  From start to finish we were looked after by all the staff nothing was a trouble.  The quality of food the ambience the cleanliness.,5,2017,05,12
209,Treasured Experience,The Conrad provided me with an unforgettable experience of Irish hospitality at the conclusion of a very demanding and enjoyable visit to my homeland. Many thanks to all who provided wonderful service.,5,2017,05,11
209,Lovely,"What an absolutely lovely stay in this hotel. We arrived early in Dublin and did not expect our room to be ready. Not only was it ready but we got an upgrade. For Hilton diamond members this is a great property. The breakfast is good and the service was great. They have a great craft beer pub downstairs. It gets quite lively when the weather is nice. A nice mix of locals and tourists. Staff is eager to give advice if you are not sure what you might like. The coburg restaurant had excellent food at comparable prices to other restaurants of equal quality in Dublin. Every staff member we ran into was ready to help, and they all did it with a smile. Location is adjacent to st Stephens green, so very centrally located. ",5,2017,05,10
209,The loveliest stay in the loveliest hotel!,"This hotel, first of all, is so easy to access from the airport. It was our first time in Dublin and we booked a coach from the airport that took only 30min to get us at the end of Earlsfort Terrace, where the hotel is. 
When we arrived, we were greeted by the loveliest staff at the door, as well as at Reception.
Check in was quick and easy and we went up to our luxurious room on the 6th floor, with views on the concert hall...MAGICAL! 
The room was simply dreamy! The room have been recently refurbished and just look so stylish, yet not pretentious at all. 
We had little chocolates on the pillows and a nice card from the person who came to prepare our room, such a nice touch.
The bed was simply heaven, we slept so good! 
We went for a drink at the Lemuel's Bar & Lounge. Our original choice was the Alfie Byrne's Pub downstairs but unfortunately they do not serve Guiness! So we went to Lemuel's and had a nice pint of Guiness and a delicious glass of Malbec, with a few nibbles. Just what we needed! Staff was awesome at Lemuel, very helpful in choosing my wine and service for the food was really quick. I had a smoked Irish salmon on ryebread, so simple, but so good that I'm still thinking about it! And nothing was too much trouble for them; we asked for a portion of chips that was not on the menu and they were great.
The next morning, we were greeted once again by really polite and friendly staff at breakfast. Conrad Dublin breakfast is simply a dream, there are so many delicious choices in the buffet area but also on the a la carte menu. The staff was very efficient in getting us coffee and tea right away.
Later on we had dinner at the Coburg Brasserie. The atmosphere was quiet but comfortable and once again, the staff were very attentive. The food was just delightful.

The area around the hotel is quiet but pleasant, as it is a 2min walk to Stephen's Green, a cute park where we spent most of our Sunday afternoon as it was sunny and warm. 
For the rest of the excitement in Dublin, we were about 20min walk from Temple Bar (we did not bother with buses since it was our first time, we wanted to see everything) which was perfect.

We absolutely recommend this hotel and will definitely come back to it next time we are in Dublin. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay!",5,2017,05,10
209,"Good hotel, great staff ","Very nice hotel, staff was very kind. It's a nice renovated Conrad but not the best from a physical layout, I have stayed at. The kindness of the staff, great breakfast and best bar staff (Daniel) highlighted the stay. ",4,2017,05,09
209,Dublin 2017,"As always, the Conrad never is a dissappointment, we are treated like kings and queens from the moment we step onto the property until the time of our departure.  The rooms are spacious and clean and the staff is impeccable.  ",5,2017,05,08
209,"Very nice, but not 5 star","The hotel is well located and very clean with large, comfortable rooms. However I can't give it 5 stars as the service we received wasn't up to that level. Two things stood out from our 3 night stay - our room was serviced once a day and this was usually quite late in the afternoon. So returning to our room mid afternoon and finding it not serviced wasn't what I expected. Also regarding room service I wasn't impressed that we didn't receive a turn down service - not a necessity, but something I expect from a 5 star hotel. We have stayed at the Conrad in The Algarve (and are returning) and this hotel has a long way to go to get to the 5 star standard of that hotel. ",4,2017,05,08
209,A perfect place to rest your head,"We are Hilton brand loyalists and we're delighted to stay at the Conrad Dublin. After a red eye flight, they had a room available for a very early check in. We rested before exploring Dublin. The staff was kind, warm and helpful. The breakfast was superb. ",5,2017,05,07
209,Definitely THE place to stay.,Nothing not to like. Hotel top notch. Staff are excellent at their jobs and are very engaging with the guests. Restuarant food and service was at a consistently high standard & quality. It's the best. ,5,2017,05,07
209,The Concierge - Danny Osullivan was beyond excellent!!!,The Concierge - Danny O'Sullivan was beyond excellent!!!   He arranged site seeing to our request!! Made our stay outstanding!! It was my Husband's Birthday and he took care of Dining detail!! The room was lovely and tasteful .A very pleasant experience and we wish we could return some day soon!,5,2017,05,07
209,Fabulous weekend,"Very friendly welcome 
Rooms very clean and comfortable
Lovely bar food and delicious buffet breakfast. Staff very friendly and helpful when we needed directions etc. Perfect location for weekend break. Definitely will be back!!",5,2017,05,07
209,Excellent place to stay,"Very nice and comfortable rooms. Excellent service. The bar and restaurant where friendly and had real good food. I can recommend that you have dinner in the restaurant. And of course try the Irish coffee in the bar. Make sure tho that you have it with whiskey. 
",5,2017,05,07
209,Great hotel ,First time visiting Dublin.  The Conrad is a fine comfortable modern hotel with friendly helpful staff.  Well located to explore Dublin.  Breakfast was excellent quality. Well worth staying at and highly recommended ,4,2017,05,07
209,Excellent Hotel,"Good Location in proximity to the City Centre and beautiful parks. Hotel about to be redeveloped . Rooms had everything required from a business perspective, power plugs etc. WiFi was ok(free when you book through HHonors). Breakfast was good, at times not enough space.",4,2017,05,07
209,Relaxing Stay,"My friend and I spent a night at the hotel recently which we thoroughly enjoyed.  The hotel is close to St Stephen's Green which is a lovely park with a lake and swans, ducks etc.  The weather was lovely and lots of people were sitting having lunch in the park.  I had checked in the day before online and chosen my room so we only needed to collect our keys from reception.  The room was located on the fourth floor and was very quiet.  It was extremely clean and bright.  The bed was the most comfortable I think I have ever slept in and the pillows, bedlinen and duvets were of the best quality.  The bathroom was spacious and once again spotless.  We had breakfast the following morning and I cannot fault anything.  The choice of cereals including 3 Gluten Free was excellent.  I was delighted to have a choice of Gluten Free bread as well.  The cooked omelette was delicious and I added a few extras from the selection of salad vegetables at the cold section  I would be surprised if the selection offered was a disappoinment to anyone.  I even got a Gluten Free muffin to have as a snack later in the day. If I returned to Dublin in the future I would definately choose this hotel.",5,2017,05,05
209,Grand hotel within waking distance of many attrations in Dublin,"A very nice hotel located within a 10-20 minute walk of many of Dublin's attractions (Trinity College/Book of Kells, Dublin Castle, Christ Church & St Patrick's Cathedrals, National Gallery, etc.). The check-in was smooth, the concierge gave great directions and recommendations for a walking tour and classic Irish pubs. The room was spacious with a novel desk/bench configuration...with all the power connectors needed to get my PC and phones charged up. The staff knocked on the door twice within the first hour after we arrived to bring us water, offer a turn-down service, and even provided a nice little ""anniversary"" plate of chocolates--nice! I loved the fact that they provided USB connectors at the bedside tables so I could charge my phone (aka 'alarm clock') without having to use my U.S. converters/adapters. I had the breakfast buffet, which was great (order the Belgian Waffle) and they offered fresh-on-the comb honey! The only 'bump' was one out-of-service elevator, so rather than wait for the crowds we found the stairs--they apologized, but since it was May 1 (a holiday), getting service was delayed. The Doorman was very helpful and gave us some good guidance on shipping things home (the post office is 1/2 block away in the back of a coffee shop). As close to 5-Star as I've ever stayed in.",5,2017,05,04
209,A nice hotel well loacted,"I stayed here for 4 days. The hotel is well located within walking distance to Temple Bar and Grafton St. 
The room was comfortable and very clean, hotel staff helpful. 
The breakfast in the restaurant was outstanding.",4,2017,05,04
209,Good Hotel but did meet my 5 Star Expectations,"I have stayed in 5 star hotels and unfortunately this does not meet with my expectations.  The hotel was lovely but not wow.  There was noise in the early morning due to other guests returning in the early hours of the morning which was not dealt with immediately, I rang three times.  If I was staying in a five star again it would have to be Powerscourt in Wicklow and travel into Dublin city.",3,2017,05,02
209,"Staff is great, hotel is modern and clean.","Lovely hotel if you like morenof a modern feel. Rooms are very comfortable and clean. Availability of usb charging port was a welcome surprise!  Only issue was a broken elevator which caused inconvenient delays, especially during business conference hours when getting to a meeting on time is most important.  Seagulls were noisy outside the window but not much the hotel can do about that. Overall a nice place to stay, easy walk to great restaurants, shops and Temple Bar area. ",5,2017,05,01
209,Excellent Hotel and Service,We love Conrad hotels and this one was just perfect. The room was well appointed and had a decent size bathroom. The staff was absolutely perfect and we loved the gym. It's in a great location just down the street from St Stephen's Green. The breakfast was also very good. We will definitely stay here again when in Dublin. ,5,2017,05,01
209,perfect stay for a business trip,"I was really pleased with the stay at the Conrad in Dublin. Nice Rooms, great breakfast and the Pub in the basement takes the cake!
As it's really near to the city center you don't really need to think about transportation or similar. Very friendly staff. Only downside was that there were some construction work going on inside the hotel and a lot of times it got really loud (they started already at 8.30 a.m. Therefore not 5 stars due to a lack of ""customer experience management""",4,2017,04,29
209,Conference ,"The hotel is in a great location. The staff were very friendly. The breakfast was outstanding. The one but, rooms were disappointing for a Conrad. Honestly i have stayed in a new hampton inn that was nicer. ",3,2017,04,28
209,Worst 5* service we ever had,"We stayed for 2 nights with my fiancé in Conrad, one of their suites actually. The price we paid is 1480€ for 2 nights + room services, so basically for the price we could've rented apartment for month in Dublin. We are used to get good service and this was most horrible ever. First of all the reception was not answering calls, they have no spa so my fiancé asked for their spa advice and make us reservation somewhere in the city and they apologized that they don't collaborate and don't know any spas. Are you freaking kidding me?? I am paying 740€ per night as you can't google the spa and make me reservation??? Moreover during the breakfast we asked to change the table and the waitress absolutely did not care and said ""oh but we would have to get it ready"" then MAKE A MOVE and get it ready because we are renting a suite not because we want a couch and a table, but because we want a brilliant service and staying and THEN literally after 1,5 minutes her colleagues sat another couple to that table. Very disrespectful towards us... MOREOVER the suite windows has so much birds poop on it... really guys... if they treat their most expensive rooms clients this way what can we speak about?... we were offered free drinks vouchers for this so yeah very nice but I can afford Coke Zero by myself and you couldn't even google a spa for me... horrible, we will never recommend it to anyone and never come back there again, definitely a waste of money, could've got better service in any 3* I am sure ",1,2017,04,28
209,World Class Property and Staff,"Just about everything went right with my stay at the Conrad. I booked with HHonors points for the week of St. Patricks Day. It was my first time staying at a Conrad property. Everything was very nice, from fresh flowers in the lobby to all the staff members dressing very professionally. Everyone greeted me with 'Sir'. The dining options were great. I visited the basement bar several times, as well as the lobby restaurant and the lobby bar. Each has their own charm and price levels. I would definitely stay at this property again, and I'd recommend it to anyone.",5,2017,04,27
209,Great Location in Dublin,"We stayed at the this hotel for two nights. Very friendly and helpful staff. Restaurant was excellent. My husband loved the recorded music, jazz mostly. Rooms have individual controlled temperature. The hotel is located within a short walk to some really good pubs and a nice park. Rooms were quiet.",5,2017,04,26
209,Perfect 2 nights in Dublin,"We were greeted at reception with the 4 words everyone wants to hear after a 7 hour flight, ""your room is ready""---the room, service, restaurant, and especially Gary the bellman were all superb.  The hotel is convenient to sights in Dublin, and the various bus routes.",5,2017,04,26
209,Even better than before...!,"We've stayed here on a few occasions over the past few years while we stay in Dublin City and it's always been really good, since the refurb it's even better...

The location is obviously ideal as it's so near to town but they've upgraded all the bedrooms, restaurant and bar and they're even nicer now. 
The bar has an excellent selection of drinks, especially the gins and cocktails!
The food in the restaurant was delicious especially the steak and the wine list is great too...!

I won't be leaving it as long the next time to revisit...love it..!  

",5,2017,04,25
209,The Court and the Hotel,"Such a lovely place, the Coburg at the Conrad. Splendidly furnished and themed around Gullivers Travels, a top notch 5 star experience with beautiful good, excellent wine selection and warm considerate service. I've stayed at the Hotel and it really is the most fantastic experience, tasteful, large, well appointed rooms, excellent responsive service,  Thoroughly recommended. ",5,2017,04,25
209,Pleasant stay in heart of the city,"Conrads the world over provide a consistently great experience, and this hotel in Dublin is no different. Very friendly staff, newly refurbished rooms, and close proximity to St. Stephen's Green are all positives. The only reason I didn't give it all 5 stars is that the continuing construction was still an inconvenience during our stay in April. You definitely felt like you needed a hard hat during the day, such was the sound volume of the work. Also, during our first stay the hot water was out so our showers were, let's say, awakening. 

Once the construction is completely finished, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",4,2017,04,24
209,Outstanding,Comfort and luxury and only 10 minutes walk from all we wanted to do. Breakfast was simply outstanding and I would return just for this! As a Dubliner I didn't know how much this hotel has changed in recent years and would highly recommend it.,5,2017,04,24
209,Construction is complete ,"This hotel is top notch from rooms to people.  They go out of their way to take care of anything you need.  

The hotel is beautiful and turned out amazing after the upgrade.  This is my second time visiting the hotel and it just gets better.  Very central location and close to great pubs and restaurants.",5,2017,04,23
209,A true 5 star experience,"Spent one night in this fantastic hotel and we didn't want to leave! The hotel has been refurbished to the highest of quality and everything about this hotel is 5 stars. 
Having pre-checked in online through my Hilton honours app, the check in process was quick and easy. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to an immaculate junior suite, and the bedroom was everything you would expect it to be, and more. Dinner was exceptional, from the service, to the wine, to the delicious food and perfectly cooked steaks! Breakfast is served in the fabulous Coburg restaurant and  offers a huge variety of breakfast options.
Will definitely be back really soon I hope!!",5,2017,04,23
209,excellent hotel,"much better than the standard Hilton. Pleasant room with all mod cons, excellent breakfast, helpful staff. Didn't eat dinner so can't really comment on the food although breakfast was excellent (and complimentary as a gold member). Perfectly situated just of St Stephen's Green. Would strongly recommend,",5,2017,04,22
209,Excellent,"An excellent stay in a beauuiful hotel that had been very nicelly renovated.
All the team members I have interacted with were very king & helpfull. I will definitly stay at the Conrad Dublin when next in the Irish capital !",5,2017,04,21
209,Excellent service,"If you're looking for extraordinary in hotel accommodations,  you have to stay at the Conrad In Dublin, Ireland. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are what my wife and I call extraordinary! The best part of our stay. Don't go anywhere else unless you prefer mediocre. ",5,2017,04,20
209,Lovely hotel,"Really lovely hotel, great location, central but a little out of the way, a short walk through St Stephen's Green and you are right in the centre of things. The staff are really friendly too, great atmosphere. ",5,2017,04,18
209,Service not at luxury hotel standard,There was a sudden power cut for over an hour in the evening for which no explanation was offered.  We asked for the sofa bed to be made up for our son at check in but this was not done. Had to ask again in the evening and had to wait another hour until this was done at about 10pm.,3,2017,04,18
209,stay at Conrad,"great location next to National Concert Hall and St Stephens Green on direct Bus route from Huston  train Station  restaurant for dinner very good fresh fish. Breakfast all you would need to start the day.
Staff very friendly and helpful liked decor would love to stay again but will have to save. ",5,2017,04,17
209,Amazing hotel ,"We stayed for one night need and breakfast over easter.  The hotel is so gorgeous since they did it up.  We had stayed years ago and really noticed the improvement to the decor. The staff are so helpful,  rooms are SPOTLESS!!! There wasn't a scrap of dust or dirt anywhere!!!!  Loved it.  The breakfast was the best thing about the whole stay! There was a great selection and really honeycomb!  10/10 for the food! Its great value for the standard ",5,2017,04,17
209,A fantastic experience,"Our sincere thanks to all the staff who made our stay exceptional. The hotel itself is beautiful and luxurious. Our meal was delicious and we could not have been attended to any more than we were. The bed was super clean/comfortable as was the room. Our cocktails were devine and theatrical. I highly recommend this hotel and especially the staff, you made our night at the Opera all the more magical. Thank you.",5,2017,04,17
209,Awesome stay at the Conrad,"Beautiful hotel.  Very comfortable room with the highlight being an incredibly comfortable bed and lovely linens.  Hotel staff very friendly.  Relaxing quiet breakfast with various choices, both cold and hot.  I would definitely recommend this Hotel to others.  The only thing I was missing was a small nightlight in the bathroom.",5,2017,04,17
209,All-around great place,"I stayed here for 4 nights recently.  It's a good location - not right next to much (but the concert hall is across the street!), but I was able to walk everywhere I needed to be - 20 minutes or less.

The room was freshly redone - it even still smelled of new paint.  Overall, the room had everything I needed.  The desk was a little small, but I nit-pick.

Breakfast there was a bonus.  I usually don't do hotel breakfast buffets, but this one was quite nice.",5,2017,04,16
209,Definitely Deserves 5 Stars,"Spent 3 nights and was very impressed with everything! The staff was outstanding in every way possible. Friendly staff is an understatement, all of them went above and beyond my expectations. I can't say enough about the entire staff from the front desk to the bellman. They hustled they smiled and they were always willing to assist with anything. Rooms were immaculate and very well decorated, the toiletries were all high end and included everything. Buffet breakfast was outstanding, very healthy choices the yogurt was the best ever with granola. Tremendous selection of fruits, pastries, bread/toast and all very fresh. Their fresh butter is outstanding!! I would never stay anywhere else when I return to Dublin, perfect location and an easy walk to anything imaginable. Pubs, shopping culture and a very nice park.  Highly recommend this hotel! ",5,2017,04,14
209,Great service in a great location.,The Conrad was perfect. Thanks to Louise at the front desk for helping me get checked in quickly and a bit early. Rest of the staff was all very friendly as well and went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect.,5,2017,04,13
209,very pleasant stay,"The rooms, the service, the food were very good. Personnel was very friendly and accommodating. The concierge recommend a great day trip with picky up from the hotel. The location is within walking distance to numerous parks, shops restaurants and pubs.",5,2017,04,13
209,Beautiful surroundings matched by the experience. ,"My wife and I visited the Coburg Brasserie for a quiet birthday celebration. Hotels would not normally be our place of choice to eat and we were a little unsure what to expect. However we were very impressed with the level of friendly service, beautiful decor and, most importantly, the food. 

This was indeed a fine dining experience and one to be recommended to tourists and locals alike who are looking for something upmarket. 

",5,2017,04,12
209,Great hotel,Ideally located hotel .Five min walk to Grafton St through St Stephens Park.Hotel was very welcoming and professionally run with polite and attentive staff.Breakfast was fabulous with everything you could think of and more.Staff couldn't do enough.Rooms very clean and well equipped. Nice to be acknowledged by staff who passed you . I would recommend this hotel for its quality and location and would definately go back.Bus stops across the way and taxi rank as you exit hotel lobby. ,5,2017,04,11
209,Fab hotel in the heart of Dublin,"We had such a lovely stay. We were upgraded to a suite as we were celebrating our anniversary. Room, breakfast and staff were all excellent. We received complimentary macaroons on our first night and chocolate dipped strawberries the second night. Could not have asked for more, will def be back ",5,2017,04,11
209,"Good location, clean, comfortable rooms","My husband and I stayed at the Conrad for 5 nights. Its very well located with St Stephan's Green just a stroll away. Also close to shopping areas like Grafton Street with lots of restaurants nearby. Next door to the hotel are little shops for a grab and go coffee sandwich, ATM etc which was convenient. Airport Shuttles (757) stops outside the hotel which is very convenient. Hotel itself was very clean, comfortable, doormen were lovely. Did not have breakfast at the hotel as it was a little pricey considering you could get a really good breakfast a walk away at Beanhive, Dawson Street or KC Peaches for a lot less. Only quibble we had with the hotel was that there were some maintanence / construction work going on directly above us during the day and it was a little annoying as my husband was trying to study for his exams. Otherwise, lovely hotel to stay at.",4,2017,04,11
209,Great stay at the Conrad Dublin!,"Thanks for a great stay, lovely hotel.  Great location, very central and excellent service.  Lovely furnishings, great bed and very comfortable pillows.  The only odd thing was that that minibar was empty and you had to call room service for everything.  Only a small thing, apart form that it was great. ",5,2017,04,10
209,Can't recommend at this time: Issues at odds with otherwise excellent hotel,"The main issues I had with the hotel were here:
1. The bathtub took 40-60 minutes to fill.
2. The heat came on very slowly. I turned it on, on the highest setting, around 10 pm and went to sleep around midnight still cold, and at around 4 am it began making a loud clanking sound so I had to turn it off, so I woke up cold as well, earlier than I intended.
3. The piercingly loud fire alarm testing at 11am every day is kind of absurd. Since room service breakfast is orderable until 10:30am, presumably the hotel accepts that some guests may still be having a relaxing breakfast in their room at this time.

For these issues, I would probably not recommend this hotel to anyone other than an early riser who does not take baths visiting in warmer weather (rather specific recommendation). 

Noise from renovations:
My room was upgraded due to my request to avoid the noise of renovation - which is good, but I was originally supposed to be on the 6th floor, directly below the renovations that begin at 9am, despite my written request for a quiet room. I only received an upgraded, quiet room because I read about the noise on TripAdvisor and called before checking in. My original 6th floor room would have obviously been unacceptable. I would say that the rate is too high to be in a loud room, but there is really almost no low enough cost to be awakened by construction while on vacation. 

Finally, I preordered room service breakfast for my checkout morning, which was 40 minutes late due to being ""in the wrong stack"". They did not end up charging me for it, but I was not able to shovel it all down before I had to leave for the airport, poor way to start a 21 hour travel day.

Not a great redemption at 50k points per night. Unfortunate because the staff were mostly* amazing (particularly Ivana), and the food was fantastic. In room Nespresso machine is a nice touch.

*I say ""mostly"" because no one got the door or acknowledged me on the way in our out when I was wearing my travel backpack. At all other times I was received by a friendly staff person.  No one was staffing the HHonors desk either. 

Note to the Conrad: young, fit people sometimes choose to travel with a backpack due to convenience, and staff should be advised to greet all guests equally.
",3,2017,04,10
209,Couldn't have been any better,The hotel is very well located and all the staff were great. Rooms are very large and the internet was free. The Pub downstairs was very good with decent pub meals and los of choice of beers --- funny though Guinness is not available.,5,2017,04,09
209,Spectacular,"This hotel is a real gem in the capital. After a big renovation, the lobby, rooms and outlets are just fabulous. A real sense of Luxury, nothing is too much for the staff. From Philip and all his team at the desk, to Thomas in breakfast and the team in the bar. Service with a smile, wonderfully hospitable and talented. Flowers in the lobby add a spring feel to the interior. Beds very comfortable and the room amenities from top to bottom are delightful. Turndown service adds something special to the end of the day. A nice touch. 

I'll be sure to recommend this hotel back home in the UK. 
Congratulations and keep up the great work. ",5,2017,04,07
209,My favourite hotel,"My stay could not have been any better due to the location, STAFF, SERVICE, ROOMS, VIBES & the food.This hotel is for customer service, beautiful and stylish rooms, staff that goes the extra mile to make you feel welcome. This is my favourite hotel!",5,2017,04,06
209,A 5* service with 6* experience if that is even possible,"Went to the Conrad Dublin for our graduation and was welcomed by the fantastic concierge at the entrance. Martin was exceptional! Great company when outside and amazing personality. Check in experience was amazing! Ivana offered an express check in and even offered to show me to the room. A great stay with a fantastic private evening organised for us with an even better night sleep. 
Will be back soon! 
Thank you Conrad Dublin. ",5,2017,04,06
209,Great Experience,"Celebrated our 10th Wedding Anniversary in the Conrad Hotel.
Very enjoyable stay, great room, breakfast was excellent, staff very helpful.  All round good atmosphere.
Would have no problem booking this hotel again when staying in Dublin.",5,2017,04,06
209,Fantastic From The Second We Walked In,"Spent just two nights but everything was truly perfect. Arrived at 8:30 am and was able to check in or wait just an hour or two for a nicer room. I chose to wait and the front desk escorted me to the restaurant and gave me vouchers for snacks and coffee and then came to let me know when my room was ready. A truly 5 star experience all the way. My only regret is not being able to stay longer. 

The hotel is in the city center and is very walkable to all that Dublin has to offer.",5,2017,04,05
209,Afternoon Tea ,"Myself and my two sisters were here on the 2nd of April for Afternoon Tea ... we were treated like royalty from the moment we stepped foot through the doors. We were shown to our table by the lovely Damien, he looked after us for our entire visit. What a lovely chap, so nice and polite, with lots of patience for us as we asked about the difference teas and cocktails and with a fabulous smile he explained it all in detail to us. My sister is recovering from cancer and hasn't been out very often, she said Damien made her feel like a real life princess, and was walking on air for the rest of the day ❤ So, we will make a return for that very reason 🤗 plus the afternoon tea was exquisite ! ",5,2017,04,04
209,"Good location, good staff, good breakfast, only minor issues","Stayed here twice for 2 nights each during a recent trip.  Parking was easy, parking directly underneath the hotel for 20 euro a day.  The hotel itself is well located, only about a 20 minute walk max to things like the Temple Bar, college area, ha'penny bridge, etc.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and breakfast was a good spread of breads and meats and such, plus a hot item from a menu (we had breakfast included).  

The rooms themselves were a good size, with good size bathrooms and plenty of quality bathroom products inside.  The beds were comfortable and overall the rooms were quite nice.  The first stay we were on the first floor, which I will say was exposed to a ton of noise in the middle of the night.  We could hear the crew cleaning the lobby and such during the middle of the night, and they were LOUD...talking, laughing etc.  To be fair, the lady who checked us in warned us that it could be loud at night, so I cannot be too angry since I took that room knowingly...although I honestly did not expect so much noise.  Regarding Wi-Fi, we had it although I am not sure if it is free for Hilton elite members only or if it is free for everyone.

The only other minor issue was that we exited our room one day and somehow the interior chain locked itself behind us, locking us out, which was odd.  The staff came promptly and took the chain off, but I did think it was a little odd that no one thought to check the room first (what if someone had gone inside?) or even offer a ""hey, sorry about this"".  Not a big deal, more strange than anything.  

Overall, the service was very good and everyone was pleasant and helpful and the hotel itself was comfortable and well located for our purposes.  I would not hesitate to stay again.",5,2017,04,04
209,"Classy but not pretentious, LOVED this hotel.","Where do I start. This is the only real 5 star hotel in Dublin, I kid you not. The staff are freaking amazing; from the check in staff to the housekeepers, they are the best. I've stayed in a lot of hotels around the world and the Conrad Dublin puts them all to shame. We were in Dublin for one night, I booked 5 rooms since I was having family meet us there. all the rooms were perfect. The Concierge had handled all my requests before we arrived to the last word. The food in the Coburg Brasserie was amazing. I can't put it into words, but this hotel and staff went way above my expectations. The Dublin staff are an asset to this hotel.",5,2017,04,03
209,Wish I brought my ear plugs,"With the great reviews of this hotel, I was excited for our stay (March, 2017). We paid for upgraded room to the best they had. Unfortunately, the construction directly above our room (hammer drills, hammering, scraping) was so loud from morning to night, that we couldn't sleep in or even be in the room during the day. Truly deafening loud. Apologies from the polite staff, but no compensation or offer to change our room location. Would have changed hotels if we were going to stay longer than 3 days.",2,2017,04,03
209,Great hotel,"Nicely located in the business section of Dublin.  Personnel are great and checking in was a breeze.
Lots of fine restaurants within walking distance.  I would highly recommend this fine hotel with first
class rooms.",5,2017,04,02
209,Wonderful Hotel,Was attending a concert at the National Concert Hall and the hotel was ideally located just across the road. Just a short walk across Stephens Green to Grafton Street for shopping  Had a lovely meal and drinks in the bar Lemuels.  Really comfy bed in a nice size room.  I had free wifi as I am a member of the Hilton Honours scheme.  Otherwise there is a charge for it.  Had a room near the lifts but it was still very quiet.,5,2017,04,02
209,60th Birthday,Outstanding Hotel. Great Location. The staff is fantastic! Can't wait to return. If you go on any day trip (you Should) they will pack you a breakfast for the road. Pub down below was great way to end a long day.,5,2017,04,02
209,A wonderful experience!,"We absolutely loved this hotel! The staff was way friendlier than anywhere else we have ever been. This five star hotel absolutely deserves their five stars. We have only once before been this satisfied and that was in hotel Saratoga (Havana, Cuba). Everything was perfect from top to the bottom.

The room was clean and there was enough space for everything. All the facilities were top of the list. But what we loved the most, was the breakfast and the staff. Both of them were just perfect. The breakfast was impeccable and the staff was polite and always met with a smile on their face. I don't think there could ever be any fault in this hotel. I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Dublin for a one night or more, because in addition to the above mentioned, the location is perfect.",5,2017,04,01
209,Great location and very good service,"Stayed for 2 nights on business. Reasonable rates,  great location and very good service. Comfortable rooms, good breakfast and courteous staff.  A vry short walk to St Stephen's Green and some great pubs and restaurants.",5,2017,04,01
209,Very comfortable and great stay,Very comfortable hotel and easy to get around the city. Helpful and friendly staff. The bar is a fabulous one and well known for its craft beers but if you are a beer heathen like myself it was a little ironic that the only drink that was not available was a pint of Guinness!,5,2017,04,01
209,Hotel stay,Professional staff and good location. Quality of food offered for breakfast and dinner were great. Only complaint was the take out breakfast as we took a local tour and the bread was dry and no spoon for the yogurt.,5,2017,03,30
209,"High quality, smart, friendly hotel with a sophisticated relaxed atmosphere in the heart of a busy city.","We stayed in the hotel over St Patricks Weekend in Dublin -  we ourselves were over for the Ireland v England Rugby game. Needless to say the city was all action! The hotel we knew was sold out so we were expecting a bit of lower quality in service and a busy hotel. What we received at the hotel was the top quality of service from all the hotel staff and the staff at Alfie Byrne's. Amid all the hustle and bustle outside the hotel, the hotel offered a tranquil and relaxed atmosphere at all times. The room was lovely and the bed ultra comfortable. Would recommend guests to avail of the breakfast and a lunch at the Alfie Byrne bar - don't be afraid to try the different beers.",4,2017,03,29
209,Gem of a hotel,Beautiful hotel with stunning decor and fabulously friendly welcoming staff. Great location in walking distance to most of the sights. Breakfast was excellent with extra menu items if you wanted. Both bars were very comfortable. Only thing we'd have suggested was that Alfie Byrnes stocked Guiness. We really liked the pub atmosphere here and understand it's a craft beer place but in Dublin there should be at least one Guinness tap. Tha barman said we could bring Guiness from upstairs bar down but that meant one of us going up and down. We went to the upstairs bar instead. It's decor is beautiful and with attentive staff and a nice buzz we weren't disappointed. ,5,2017,03,28
209,Fantastic stay at Conrad Dublin!,"Just returned from a fantastic four night stay at the Conrad! Great location, beautiful brand new rooms, and lovely breakfasts and Lemuel bar.  The attentiveness and warmth of the amazing staff were equal to the beautiful facilities.  (Deephu and Natasa at front desk, David the Concierge, Isabella the room attendant just to name a few). Every request  was accommodated  with care and a smile.  Perfect choice for  a Dublin vacation.  ",5,2017,03,28
209,Wonderful hotel,"Stayed here for a few nights before going to a wedding. The rooms and service were excellent. The restaurants and bars looked very impressive and the food and drink were delicious. My room was spacious, spotless and looked lovely. I can't recommend it enough. Thank you for the great stay.",5,2017,03,27
209,A great hotel in Central Dublin,"If you are looking for an excellent 5-star hotel than stay at The Conrad in Dublin. This is the hotel experience at hit's best. The rooms are a decent size and very clean. The staff are professional hoteliers at their finest. Impeccable service, consistent and they do sweat the small stuff. Need help finding anything in Dublin, their concierge services will work with you to find a restaurant, book an event. Do whatever it takes to make your stay in Dublin that much better. The onsite restaurant and bar are also very good.

As a HHonors Diamond member with Hilton, this is one hotel that I would highly recommend if you want a fine stay in Dublin. Well done folks.",5,2017,03,27
209,"PRICES HIGH, ATTENTION TO DETAIL AND CUSTOMER PROMISE LOW","For business reasons - more for location than anything else - I have stayed at the Conrad many times over the last few years.  The recent renovation is very stylish, the rooms handsomely appointed and all very much a vast improvement on the dated style of years past.

However the most disappointing factor about our recent stay was a lack of detail, absence of loyalty recognition (through Hilton Honors) and plain and simple, honest to goodness customer service from some of the staff.

Dublin is awash with good hotels - good and expensive and most, if not all, are actaully better situated geographically than the Conrad which is located in a desolate area opposite the National Concert Hall.  Step for step it's not out of the way so much as that it feels like it's in a bit of a ""no man's land""  Like I say we stay there for convenience.  Like many top end hotels it's not the cheapest option and competition at top end of the hotel market should be driven by the quality of the hotel, the staff and the service.  It's the last two areas which let this hotel down.

We arrived very late - 1am after driving from Belfast and our arrival coincided with the clocks going foward for British Summer time so actually 2am.  For the price we paid, the time in this property was going to be short!  The Night Manager welcomed us as warmly as Bela Lugosi to Graveside Manor.  No real welcome, no warmth - nothing to acknowledge our late arrival, you must be tired etc.  Such was his greeting that we three on arrival - looked at each other nervously like we were stood before the School Master to recieve our punishment.  Also, despite the hotel NOT being full - no acknowledgment to me as a Hilton Diamond member, no upgrade, no smile, no chance, no way.  Oh dear - and then sent to bed without any supper!

As I have mentioned, the rooms themselves are lovely so thing to fault there.  You might want to avoid the east facing rooms beacuse, despite an embarssing volume of material making up the sumptous drapes - they actually do little to black out the room and fail in keeping out the morning sun from filling the room in the morning.  My room had recently been renovated so the smell of paint did still pervade and the switches and air conditioning controls did still show the paint spatters and sprays from the recent works.  The other thing was that the minibar in my room was not actually plugged in to the power so when I retrieved my warm bottles of water the fridge emitted the most rank smell - like an unused fridge in an old caravan which hasnt been used since the last trip to Ventor.  Dank and musty the smell hung in the air for the rest of the night.  Oh dear.

Early the following morning - after but a few hours sleep and on a peaceful Sunday mornign at 8:30am.  I am awoken by Housekeeping cleaning the room opposite mine.  She's vaccuming the room and bashing the head of the vaccum cleaner against the wardrobes and skirting boards with such a force that I thought someone was breaking down my door.  To top this off she's speaking to someone on room phone and having to raise her voice above the vaccum cleaner so it's like she's shouting.  Needless to say (and though red slit like eyes) I ask her what she's doing and why she's doing is at this hour.  I'm told quite curtly and most firmly that she's ""doing her job"".  Oh dear - I'm sent back to my room.

There ended my stay at the Conrad but not before speaking with the Manager who did contact me and with whom I did wearily and frustratingly offload the events of the last 9 hours of my stay.  I was offered compensation and I did recieve a genrous discount off the final bill for my room stay.

I just think that all of these things could have been avoided with an attention to detail and level of service that you would expect from a hotel of this level, and also from the room rate you are paying to enjoy the priviledge.  The staff and service let the hotel down on this stay.  Combine this with a lack of any Hilton Honors loyalty acknowledgement and you start to wonder why you're not staying at the Shellbourne or the Westbury, or the Dylan or the Westin or.....

At the time of writing, the Conrad sits at #25 on the Tripadvisor Hotels in Dublin.  Perhaps someone is doing something right, but not at the Conrad it seems...",2,2017,03,27
209,Great Visit,A wonderful stay at the Conrad Dublin.  The location is great for getting around in the City and seeing the wonders.  The Hotel provided us with all of our needs or concerns.  Will stay there again hopefully soon.,5,2017,03,25
209,"The best service, and cocktails.","My partner and I stayed here for 2 nights after our month of travelling around Europe, and it was the best place I can think of to have spent our last nights. We ate at the Hotel both nights as the food was amazing, the beds where comfortable and the rooms a good size, all staff where welcoming but a special mention for Aislin & Shane who made us many delicious cocktails and also helped us pick out some we would like, my favorite was one that Aislin had created herself, I cant remember the name of  it, but it was the best!",5,2017,03,24
209,"Restaurant COBRG  great but hotel,managers mediocre","Dorfman Gary Brendan fantastic. Valet and lots of stories about the local places . Suzanne from Zimbabwe and the local Irish servers in Coburn  couldn't be more pleasant for the bounty for breakfast .

209,Best Hotel in Europe,"One of the best Hotel Experiences I have ever enjoyed!  The Restaurant & Bar staff were beyond extraordinary!  Extremely friendly, attentive and friendly.  The Front Desk and Concierge Staff helped plan a trip to the Cliffs of Moher for us! “Very well run hotel with fantastic training”",5,2017,03,23
209,Terrific Hôtel option in city center ,"My wife and I spent four days during the St Patrick's Day celebration at the  Conrad. It was an outstanding experience. The location is right on St Stephen's green and the park acts as a wonderful barrier from the craziness and noise of Temple Bar. But it was still only a half mile walk to join in the fun. 

The real key to the great experience was the staff. Every person we encountered was just wonderful. Each morning at breakfast every face wore a great smile and they remained throughout the day. Special requests at the restaurant and help from reception and concierge were equally welcoming. 

The Hôtel offers a 110v outlet for American travelers and two USB plugs which was a big help. ",5,2017,03,23
209,A nice refresh,"Stayed here a couple of days after St. Patrick's Day craziness and found it to be warm,inviting with excellent service. 
This hotel is worth a look if you're looking for a quieter area yet close enough to the downtown/Temple bar or other attractions. 
Most of the public areas and rooms have been recently refreshed and look nice. 
Good restaurants within walking distance and at the hotel
",5,2017,03,21
209,Absolutely outstanding service and accommodations,"First time to stay in the Conrad and very impressed by the overall services of this Hilton property. The staff were so friendly and efficient. I even received a nice email the day before our stay to ask if there was anything the hotel could do to help make the stay more enjoyable. Because our rooms were not quite ready due to an early arrival, we were given coupons for free tea in the lobby bar. We also had some nice appetizers while waiting. The room was bright and well appointed. The beds were beyond comfortable and the bathroom was a nice size. Location is great with close proximity to St Stephen's Green and provides easy access to Dublin city center. We were also able to pre-arrange though the hotel for a private taxi to take us to the airport on our departure day. Overall, some of the best services we have received from a hotel stay.",5,2017,03,21
209,"a true 5 star ,,,service,quality,","We were at the Conrad for the Ireland v England finale,plus St Patricks Day.Took my 19 year old son ..On arrival  into a sedate reception area,excellent  genuine service levels

209,A Great Stay,"This is a wonderful property. Perfect location, great staff, and  wonderful amenities. I contacted the hotel via email prior to arrival to let them know that our trip to Ireland was a special occasion. I received an immediate response from the staff which let me know they were on their game. I selected the room and even knew the room number before getting on the plane in California. This was a great experience and I can't wait to come back!",5,2017,03,20
209,Lovely hotel but overpriced!,"Myself and my husband stayed here for one night on March 14th. Rooms are lovely. Staff are very nice and efficient. Only quibble would be the price. Considering that it is not cheap for an overnight stay we were surprised to find the price of extra items in the bedroom astronomically priced. An example would be a Snickers bar priced at 7 euros ! A bottle of still water at 4 euros. No free biscuits with coffee etc...
I would prefer to pay an extra 10 euros and have these included. It seems extraordinarily mean. We ate in the Alfie Byrne bar. It was very poor. Small portions and unseasoned food. We were never once asked by a staff member if everything was okay. Very disappointing! Also the bar was very cold. Every time the door to the smoking area opened a gust of cold air blew in.",4,2017,03,20
209,Just Perfect.,"We came to Dublin this time to celebrate St. Patrick's day, we have stayed in a wide variety of hotels in and around the city and never really thought enough of any of them to make a return visit.
Not so with the Conrad.
Our stay was just perfect, lovely friendly welcome, excellent 
room and a magnificent breakfast made it a must for a return visit.",5,2017,03,20
209,Great place to stay,"Wonderful place to stay. Nice location, easy to catch the hop on-hop off tour bus.   Staff very helpful with dinner and pub suggestions.  Breakfast was included and was very delicious.  Big spacious rooms,  fabulous bedding.   definitely will stay again!!",5,2017,03,19
209,Great place,"Superior service and great food.  Location was very close to air coach stop, all the sights.  We will be sure to stay here when in Dublin.  The dinner was fabulous with choices for all.  Front desk was very helpful",5,2017,03,18

209,Hotel Bar,"I went for drinks with my husband after my sister recommended the bar after a stay in the hotel. It lived up to every expectation and more! Staff were very friendly and the dark haired girl that served us (sorry I didn't catch a name!!) was very helpful and had great knowledge and recommendations of cocktails and drinks! We tried a few cocktails on their themed menu and all of them were fab! The concierge was able to get us a taxi within 5 minutes to the venue we were going to after!  Will definitely be back again in the future! Would note though that the bar fills up and gets busy very quickly, if we had arrived 15 minutes later we would not have got a seat!",5,2017,03,15
209,Lovely Hotel,"Stay Report - 3/11 - 3/13

Location: The hotel is located a block from the southeast corner of St. Stephen's Green. It's directly across the street from the National Concert Hall. You can walk to most of the main touristy places in Dublin from here quite easily and Dawson and Grafton Street are a ten minute walk away so finding a place to eat is never a problem. Also, the 757 bus to and from DUB stops half a block away which is great for getting to and from the hotel. 

Hotel: Definitely more a boutique style property than many other larger Conrads I've been to. The renovations are still not complete, there were obvious signs of construction on my floor but what's done is quite nice looking. The lobby makes good use of its space, there's a bar and attached restaurant off the lobby and also a second bar on a basement level that is not directly affiliated with the hotel I don't think.

Check In: All the staff at the hotel were very helpful. My additional guest was able to check in at noon and we were upgraded to a junior suite with pull out couch.

Room: Definitely more junior than suite, but still quite nice. The bathroom especially was incredible. My bed was comfortable, I liked having a work area as well as large closets. Evening turn down service was also very appreciated. 

Breakfast: There is no lounge unfortunately. Breakfast is 7-11 on Saturday and Sunday and 6:30 to 11 on weekdays. The staff on Sunday seemed overwhelmed by a full restaurant and orders were slow in coming out. Diamonds get either a continental buffet or the top few items on the menu below.

I paid 60,000 points per night to stay here and it was well worth it. It's not in the same league as the Conrad Hong Kong or Seoul but it's a very nice property with great staff. I'd gladly be back.",5,2017,03,14
209,Found my go-to place in Dublin!,"Traveling for a few days in Dublin, loved this location.  Walked everywhere, even got last minute tickets to the symphony right across the street at the Concert Hall.  Great music and really, just across the street!  Staff very helpful, room delightful. The pub in the basement lively and food delicious, extensive breakfast menu, and lunch or tea at the little lounge very nice, great place to sit as well.  A friendly spot in a great location.",5,2017,03,14
209,Kevin Mc Nally,Excellent service and staff.  Manager personally showed us to our room. There was a complementary bottle of wine in our room when we returned from a show. Would use again.Good parking facilities under the hotel.,5,2017,03,13
209,True to Irish Hospitality!,"I spent a fantastic weekend at this property. The room was spacious and very comfortable with all the amenities your at need. I forgot my adapter, but the desk is equipped with different connexions. 

A detail that I've never really paid any attention to before, but is worth mentioning at this hotel is the color palette throughout the hotel, i.e. light green and light pink, which is very nice, calming and welcoming.

Breakfast was very good and I had one of the most delicious fish & chips! 

The staff made me feel welcome.

I would definitely recommend this hotel and would certainly go back!",5,2017,03,13
209,Breakfast let it down,"Great location, top class rooms, and friendly staff.
Had lunch in hotel which was really good and quite reasonably priced for a hotel of this calibre. I thought the breakfast let them down. I was one of the first in to breakfast at 7am and all the food in the baine maris  was tepid. The toast was good. The tea was strong enough at second request, but the first pot was weak.
Apart from this hotel was very well appointed with rooms which were very well equipped. Very comfortable bed.",4,2017,03,12
209,A very nice hotel but real asset are staff,"We recently had a few important guests come visit Dublin and we had them stay at the Conrad Hotel. The location is great. You aren't stuck in the middle of a busy section meaning traffic isn't awful and has easy parking underneath. It is across from St. Stephens Green and the Concert Hall so you are still very central.

We had a few issues with rooms being reallocated from what we originally wanted but the staff worked their best to accommodate our needs and a solution was found. 

The rooms are very comfortable but make sure you ask for a refurbished room as they are in process of doing them all. I'd also ask for first floor rooms facing courtyard as these have wonderfully high ceilings and high windows.

Breakfast is lovely and you can either order or help yourself from the buffet available.

Found all the staff very helpful and tried to ensure our guests were well looked after.",5,2017,03,12
209,Great hotel! ,"Stayed here for work, this is a great hotel in an excellent location. Food and service was fabulous. The bar downstairs on the lower levels is great! Would definitely stay again for Business or personal!! ",5,2017,03,11
209,A great stay at the Conrad,"Service was excellent. Room was clean. Facilities were gorgeous. Great location. Overall, very pleased. The cocktails at the bar made for a refreshing start to our evening. Concierge was very helpful in finding us an excellent restaurant to dine.",5,2017,03,11
209,Excellence just got better,"I have been lucky enough to visit Dublin on a number of occasions and after developing a warm affection for the city I didn't believe it could rise any higher in my estimations. How wrong I was.

My four night stay at the Conrad is amongst the best hotel experiences I have ever enjoyed in Europe (Arabian Peninsula hotels are in a league of their own). The staff aren't just affable, they are a genuinely cheerful, helpful bunch. The bountiful breakfast bar along with the extensive menu give you surplus options to nourish yourself for the whole day ( trust me after charting a course through that breakfast - you wont be needing lunch).

From the basement bar that is overflowing with craft beers, real ales and guacamole (on your nachos of course) to the exquisite restaurant on the ground floor - there is almost no reason to ever leave the hotel... ",5,2017,03,10
209,Good steaks beautifully cooked,"My business colleague myself had a couple of well presented steaks cooked to how we both liked them, medium rare for me and well cooked for my colleague!! The food was well presented  with the sides we ordered. The service was excellent as well. The restaurant we ended up was quite dark, there is a lighter section which is better to see and read reports etc!",4,2017,03,09
209,Great Hotel Very friendly staff.,"I had a great experience in the Conrad Dublin. I was attending a Wedding in the city centre and stayed there the night of the wedding. I was checked in by Philip who was nice enough to give me an early check in and was very professional throughout the process. 
The room was well decorated and to a very high standard. 
The next morning breakfast in the room was amazing. And again great service. ",5,2017,03,09
209,Business trip,Good hotel with very helpful staff. Food excellent especially breakfast. Large room and very quiet even though in the middle of a city. Did not get time to try out fitness area due to conference timing.,4,2017,03,08
209,Another wonderful stay!,"Stayed here for three nights at the weekend - Friday to Monday in a superior twin room.  This was our second visit - stayed for two nights in mid-January and decided to come back again for my friend's birthday.  As others have said, great location, just off St Stephen's Green and a short walk to Grafton Street.
We didn't stay in a refurbished room on the last occasion, but I had e-mailed prior to this visit to ask if we could have one, which was provided.  Lovely room, massive twin beds and very comfortable.  Hotel also provided a happy birthday message to my friend in the room along with some macaroons and a nice bottle of water.
What I love about this hotel that it is very relaxing and not pretentious.  Lemal's cocktail bar is a great spot to have a drink after a busy day sightseeing or shopping - great selection of wines. spirits, cocktails etc.  We also had dinner in the Coburg brasserie last visit and this time and again good choice of starters, mains and deserts to suit most budgets.  Quality of food and service very good at dinner and great buffet breakfast.  I had the three egg omelette one morning and it was delicious.  Overall a great hotel, great location, friendly professional staff.  Will definitely stay here again if the room rates don't increase too much!!!  Also mention to Natasa who checked us in and out - very friendly.  Added bonus - arrived early not expecting to get checked in but room was available so able to be accommodated.",5,2017,03,08
209,Fabulous hotel,"We visited in March for my husbands significant birthday so we splashed out on a King Premier room. As the hotel was quiet we were able to check in when we first arrived at around 11am. The rooms were lovely, huge bed (a bit too firm for me) & massive pillows. Good storage & lots of nice bits & pieces, though the minibar & extras were expensive. The room included 2 drinks per room per night, which were house beer or wine, or soft drinks in the bar. 
The bathroom was big with a wide comfortable bath & shower cover it, lots of nice amentities, and included loads of towels (though not bath sheets, though you could have happily used two towels if needed). 
The bar was a nice peaceful place to relax, we used that quite a bit to escape the rain! 
Breakfast was very good, although the service on the menu items was quite slow, but on the plus side freshly cooked & delicious when it came (the American pancakes were yummy!). Lots of really well presented food which was all too tempting! We didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening though we did have a light lunch in the bar which was nice. 
An odd point, but the flowers in the lobby were fabulous! The whole area smelt of the wonderful & abundant lilies. 
The staff were all lovely and welcoming, and got to know you quite quickly. 
I'd stay here again though maybe not in the high priced room. 
WiFi was free on our room, but chargeable on others.",5,2017,03,07
209,Great for Business or Leisure,"I stayed here to attend a course and was extremely happy with my room and service.  The staff were friendly and very helpful.
Breakfast was lovely and again, the staff were very helpful.
It would have been nice to have a spa or therapy service available to compliment the level of service.",5,2017,03,07
209,RUGBY WEEKEND SO PRICES EXSOARABULL!!!!!,"Is it a hotel cartel that has jumped up prices when the 6 nations rugby event comes too town,prices have gone up 75%,and standards have slipped.Many hotels like the Conrad a 3 star masquerading as a 4 star,but no way,quality,service of food and drink,having stayed here 3 times in the last 5 years,I've decided no more,as the brand outside of dublin I love,but it's just too expensive for the package of what you get.",3,2017,03,07
209,A pleasure to stay at the Conrad @ Dublin,"Very friendly and kind staff. Excellent food. Clean and comfortable rooms.
Close to the center and reachable per 757 Airport bus.
Slippers and bathrobe!
Had forgotten a comb, the hotel had a new one for me. Near a beautiful park.

209,Dublin 2,"Updated hotel. Very clean, nice rooms.  Very comfortable beds.  Great breakfast. Staff is very helpful. Housekeeping is fantastic. Close to walking to shopping. Great reastrants nearby.  Would recommend this hotel.",5,2017,02,28
209,Very nice hotel,"The Conrad was a very clean and comfortable hotel. The amenities were very good.  The staff was friendly, courteous and very professional. We opted in for the buffet breakfast and there was plenty of variety, always well stocked and delicious. I would definitely stay at this hotel for future trips.",5,2017,02,28
209,Business Conference,The Conrad has excellent facilities for conference and events. The feedback from our attendees has been nothing but positive.  We will definitely Use the Conrad again.  The lunch provided was probably one of the best and the staff are extremely accommodating and helpful.   Highly recommend.,5,2017,02,28
209,Great location for a Dublin stay,"It's an easy (and pleasant!) walk through St. Stephen's Green from the Conrad Dublin to Grafton Street. Staff were friendly, rooms comfortable, complimentary breakfast delicious. We had adjoining rooms which worked out perfectly for our family of four. If you run into ""Danny Boy"" on the staff, you will have a smile on your face for the rest of the day.",5,2017,02,24
209,Wonderful Place to Stay,"obligations and then fly back to the States from there. I had contacted the hotel letting them know it was out 20th anniversary and they were exceptionally kind. We got an upgrade to the huge corner room on the floor below the Presidential Suite. There were cookies and a lovely note on the table in the room when we arrived. We arrived late in the evening and ordered room service that first nice. It was delicious and did not seem excessively priced. We ate breakfast in the Hilton Honors area and it was also top notch as we expected. 

The hotel is lovely but was undergoing renovations while we were there. One day the Honors breakfast area was closed so breakfast was in the main restaurant area. Another day they were working on the lobby. I saw other reviews mentioning how intrusive and loud the renovations were but I didn't experience that. 

I would certainly stay here again and thank the staff for making it a lovely stay.",5,2017,02,24
209,Just was not to be expected ,"My mother always says, if you have nothing good to say, say nothing at all !
Senior management at reception are the best asset of the hotel staff, respect to the concierge team, very diplomatic.
As for the second time in the last 12 months staying with the Conrad Hotel, I'm really thinking, will we be back for a third stay?
Fantastic building,
Fantastic location,
Feeling at home in Dublin ?
Yet to be determined, until next time.
When that will be, who knows.
Hope you can get service in the bar down stairs with the home brewed poor beer and upddie staff, ring a bell, seriously!!! 2017 how many stars * *  ? ? ? ?
Wish the showers had a bit of power!
Isn't that why we stay in hotels, to be pampered ",3,2017,02,23
209,Great Hotel Stay Experience,My husband and I love our stay here.  The hotel is located right in front of the National Concert Hall.  It's in walking distance to St. Stephen's Green park and Iveagh Gardens as well as restaurants and bars.  Hotel staffs are very friendly.  Great breakfast selections.  Will stay here again for sure.,5,2017,02,23
209,"Beautiful hotel, with one hiccup","The hotel is beautifully renovated, rooms are well appointed and it's located within walking distance of anything you'd want to see in Dublin. Would have been a 5 star stay except for the noise. A few minutes after checking in, the walls and ceiling of our room literally started shaking with construction noise. We were on our way out for sightseeing anyway, so I asked the concierge and she said it would be over before evening. I didn't think much of it since it was the middle of the day, and I guess maintenance work has to be done at some point, but we were also woken up the next two mornings before 8 am with the same noises (hammering, drilling, metal work?, scraping, etc. etc.) The hotel itself was lovely, but would not stay again unless I asked about construction beforehand.",4,2017,02,23
209,"Disappointed: Requested a Quiet Room, Not a Construction Site","The Conrad has a lot working in its favor.  The location is just off the beaten path but only a short walk through Stephens Green to the middle of the action.  As Hilton Honors Gold members we appreciated the complimentary breakfast and being given a refurbished room (upgraded from Standard). The renovated rooms are attractive and nicely appointed, though without any drawer space as pointed out earlier in reviews.  And, the staff is simply lovely; very kind and eager.  The entire concierge staff (including Marcin Zebrowski) were especially helpful and patient in assisting me in planning a day tour outside of Dublin.

However, the Conrad lost us within the first hour of our arrival and left a lasting poor impression. They missed the mark entirely (almost, laughably) in giving us a room that was currently undergoing construction and truly having no plan on how to resolve the situation when we immediately told them that 7 hours a day of drilling and jack hammering inside the walls of our room was not ok with us.  Sounds funny now but trust me, it wasn't at all funny at the time.

This was a grueling 3-day business trip to Dublin for my husband, which included a round trip flight to London the day after our arrival.  My husband and I both emailed the Conrad several times in advance of our stay to explain that we would be arriving at the hotel mid-morning following our overnight flight.  We requested a quiet room knowing that my husband would have maybe 45 minutes to rest before his non-stop meetings began.  We had booked (and his company paid for) an extra night the night before our arrival so that we would not have to rely on the possibility of getting an early check-in.  Our emails were acknowledged by two Guest Service Agents, and were also copied to the the reservations desk. 

Check-in at the hotel went smoothly and we were told we still had 20 minutes to catch breakfast before service ended.  We went up to our room on the 6th floor (613), my husband quickly unpacked his work clothes and suits and we went downstairs and enjoyed a light breakfast before returning to the room so he could rest. When we returned to the room we noticed that there appeared to be a temporary wall around our room ending at our doorway. There was a man behind the wall who said hello but we couldn't see much more.  After we got inside the room we heard deafening noise -- drilling, hammering, banging.  My husband and I peeked outside of our door and leaned around the temporary wall. We could see that the entire outer wall to our room was missing and the man was working inside of the wall to our room. We couldn't believe it.  We went inside and had to scream to each other that I would call down to reception to find out what was happening. 

During a short break in the noise, I called down and spoke to a different gentleman than the one who had checked us in.  I explained the situation and he said the hotel was in the process of installing a new sprinkler system and it could be related. He thought they might be just about done and he was going to call the construction company and let me know what was going on.  I relayed this to my husband and went into the bathroom to get changed as I had plans to tour the city while my husband rested. My husband crawled into bed. 

A little while later the phone rang and my husband answered it. The gentleman informed my husband that project was not, in fact, completed, but they would ""only"" be working from 9:30am until 4:30pm daily during our stay.  The construction immediately started again and my husband shouted the info to me.  I told him I would go downstairs so I could speak with someone in person on my way out.  At this point my husband had only about 20 minutes left to rest before his all-day and evening meetings, so he crawled back into bed and piled pillows on his head.

When I went downstairs I saw the gentleman who checked us in and he asked me sincerely if I loved the room. I nicely said that no, I did not love the room and told him what was going on.  He said, ""Oh, would you like me to call the construction company to find out more information?""  I explained that the company had been called already and I filled him in on what I had learned already.  He said he knew about the new sprinkler system and the construction would only be during the day, but he wanted to call again to find out for sure.  I explained that my husband was trying to rest and we should not have been given that room. He said that we were given an early check in and this was the room that was available for early check in.  He immediately realized his mistake and corrected himself -- we did not have an early check in as we had actually paid for the night before.  He reassured me that he didn't think it would continue and would call the company again while I met with the concierge and then report back. 

The conversation was pleasant and I moved over to the concierge (two desks over) while the phone call was made.  I spent about 10-15 minutes with the concierge but I never heard back about the construction and the gentleman was now tied up speaking with someone else.  I had a pre-arranged tour to meet, so I left the hotel assuming that a new room would be arranged by that evening after the construction schedule was once again confirmed by the hotel. 

Upon my return to the Conrad at around 8pm that evening, I stopped at reception and gave my room number and asked for an update about our room and the construction.  Two different staff members appeared to have no idea what I was talking about but were eager to help.  However, there were no notes in the system about the problem with our room.  I again explained the situation and was asked again if I would like the hotel to call the construction company to find out the status.  I explained they had already been called (twice) and probably would not even answer at this time of night.  One of the gentleman said he would speak to the hotel manager and get to the bottom of the situation.  

Ultimately, the hotel manager came out to speak with me, confirmed the construction schedule, apologized profusely and offered to show me a new room.  Kudos to the manager -- the first member of the staff to offer an acceptable solution.  He showed me to a room on the 7th floor where there was no construction.  I explained that my husband was still out at meetings but I would speak to him about moving when he returned at about 9pm.  

When my husband returned to the room he was exhausted and only wanted to order room service and try to get some sleep before he had to leave the hotel at 4am to catch his flight to London.  He didn't want to change rooms reasoning that what was done was done -- when he had needed it to be quiet that morning, it wasn't.  Water under the bridge. But, neither of us would even be in the room from 9:30am-4:30 pm during our remaining two days so it didn't make sense to pack everything up and move at this point.

The rest of our stay was uneventful as we were out and about during the day.  I assume that the construction continued but we were not around to hear it.  The Conrad is a lovely hotel with kind staff, but it really failed to live up to what could have been a potential 5 star experience.",3,2017,02,22
209,Five Star Bliss,"Looking for a hotel to spend our 25th Wedding Anniversary in, we chose The Conrad based mainly on reviews in Tripadvisor and we were not to be disappointed.  This hotel ticks all the boxes and truly deserves its 5 Star rating. From the moment I pulled up outside the hotel in Earlsfort Terrace we felt like honoured guests. We got an upgrade on our room #530 and this room had everything you would expect in a hotel of this class. free wifi, a state of the art flat screen television, a superb bathroom and a most comfortable bed. Though we did not eat in the restaurant it looking inviting. We had coffee and scones in the lobby and they were delicious. The location of the hotel is superb with a walk to St Stephens Green & Grafton St only a couple of minutes away.As someone who stays in Dublin several times a year The Conrad will now become ""our home from home"". Looking forward to returning soon.  ",5,2017,02,22
209,Excellent hotel in Dublin,"Always happy to stay at the Conrad, which is comfortable and well appointed. Warm and welcoming staff, lovely rooms, delicious breakfast. Good gym facilities and lovely lobby bar. Looking forward to my next stay.",5,2017,02,22
209,City Centre Luxury,"Spent a night in The Conrad to celebrate our 25th anniversary and although I have visited this hotel before it was the first time I stayed here. The hotel has been extensively renovated since my last visit and the lobby area is worthy of any 5 star hotel. I found the room to be excellent (#530) with all the trapping you would expect from a hotel of this standard. All staff that we encountered couldn't have been more helpful and it made our experience memorable. I consider the hotel to offer good value and we will definitely return. We have made a new friend in The Conrad,Dublin...keep up the good work.",5,2017,02,22
209,Afternoon tea...,Four of us went for afternoon tea on Sunday.  My friend arranged it so we could have some quality time with our mams.... when we arrived myself and my mam were early but that was no trouble we were brought to our table and asked if we would like anything to drink... a glass of white wine was ordered by my mam... bit pricy at 8.50 a glass but I suppose your in a 5 star hotel.   Our afternoon tea was lovely plenty on offer and the coffee and the tea flowed.  It was a lovely way to spend a Sunday afternoon.   There was cocktails to complete the day.  Well worth a visit staff very friendly and efficient..,4,2017,02,20
209,Perfect,"When I got a cheap(ish) deal, I assumed I would get an average room, but to my surprise the room was spacious, the bed supremely comfortable, and the bathroom luxurious. The surprises kept coming - a free copy of the Irish Times was delivered without my having asked, there was a special plug for my continental appliances and even a Nespresso machine in the room.
 But the cherry on the cake was the provision of a clothes brush, a carrier bag for shopping, a complimentary shoe shine service and even an umbrella. It's a long time since I've seen such attention to detail in a hotel in Europe. 
So I had to look really hard to find something to say that wasn't positive and all I could find was that the restaurant was a little soulless, but the friendly and helpful staff more than made up made up for that. And the food was delicious.
A great experience - rival hotel chains please copy!",5,2017,02,20
209,5 Star Experience,The creme de la creme!  The new look interior is absolutely magnificent and is opulence at its best.  Do visit and savour the ambience.

The restaurant servers excellent food and the service is impeccable. 

This is the only hotel for me when I am in Dublin and very much look forward to my next visit",5,2017,02,14

Great location close to merrion square with very helpful staff, would definitely recommend. cant remember a name but a shout out and special mention to the concierge.",5,2017,02,13
209,Weekend Break,"Booked as a weekend break package through BA, to meet with friends and celebrate 3 birthdays.  received a warm welcome at reception and upgraded rooms - spacious, clean and very comfortable bed.  breakfast was a superb spread and eggs cooked to order, on request.  Staff were all professional, friendly and helpful.  Ate dinner one night in hotel, and although pricey, again of good quality and slick service with a smile. Central location so able to wander to city centre, and local pubs etc.
In summary, an excellent weekend not dampened by the cold weather.  I would recommend the hotel as a welcoming comfortable base, with professional and friendly staff.",4,2017,02,13

209,Conrad Hotel Dublin,A very comfortable stay in a beautifully decorated hotel. Good location and lovely peaceful ambiance in the lobby and the public areas.  A lot of people were spotted having afternoon tea so no doubt it is a good destination hotel for dining as well but I only had breakfast during my stay which was very pleasant.,5,2017,02,09
209,Hotel,Ok hotel would of like breakfast included which I thought I did when I booked it via the net. Hard to find as bus from airport dropped us at the other end of lower lesson street. Had to get a cab in the ,3,2017,02,05
209,A great hotel in a central location. ,"The Conrad staff were welcoming on arrival. Swift checkin, professional and friendly. Room comfort is very good and bathroom is a good size. Food choice was good. The breakfast buffet is plentiful in choice and has a selection of additional items made to order. Over all I can't fault this hotel for a 1 night business trip. ",5,2017,02,05
209,"Great Trip to Dublin, Ireland","Thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Dublin, Ireland at the Conrad Hotel.  We enjoyed great food at the restaurant.  The location was perfectly situated within walking distance to St Stephen's Green. The staff was friendly and helpful.  Room was luxurious and bed was comfortable.  We would definitely stay at The Conrad again.",5,2017,02,02
209,"Really, really dissappointing - for a Conrad","My experience was on the whole, poor, aside from the warm welcome and reminder that the hotel was undergoing renovation. 

The lobby and ground floor is impressive. 

Into the lifts and up to your floor/room is a different story. My room looked like it hadn't been updated since I last stayed at this hotel (when it first opened and with my parents, as a boy). The carpet was so worn it felt like walking on concrete. The room was generally tired, chipped tables, scratched surfaces throughout, etc. The in-room bar was empty. When i did order a soft drink to my room I was quickly reminded that an amount equivalent to the price of the drink would be added as ""tray charge"".

The room had a door into the next, which felt like i was sharing with my neighbor. Telephone conversations, wake up alarm calls, knocks on doors (not mine), and even scents from the toilet were all shared. 

I was told there was renovation taking place on the second floor (not my floor - 5th) but when i tried to go back to my room to take a business call one afternoon drilling (which seemed to be in the wall of my room) interrupted the call - sending me to the corner of the lobby bar ultimately. I did register a complaint as on this point and was told it would be looked into - management did respond with a sparkling water and sweets delivered to my room.

I am a regular business traveler and consider the Conrad a luxury brand - this is now caveated to exclude Dublin, unfortunately. 

When booking, we had been offered a rate which was subsequently increased. I did think that given this was a superior brand i was paying for luxury - unfortunately i now feel like i have been ""had"".",2,2017,02,01
209,Lunch,Had light lunch before going to the National Concert Hall. Very good location however service and food disappointing. It took 40 mins to get a prawn & avocado salad which was a very small portion. At no time did staff check with us or ask if everything was alright.,3,2017,01,31
209,Superb. In every department.,"A magnificent hotel in an amazing location with a restaurant to rival the best in the UK and Ireland.  Conrad is blessed with fine, modern architecture within which it is superbly fitted out.  It's themed ground floor public spaces - bar, restaurant (complete with champagne table) and lobby areas, are tastefully appointed, and the bedrooms are finished to the same high standards of comfort, amenities and style,

Conrad Dublin has  topped off that foundation with a company of fabulously trained staff, who just make your stay feel extra special.  

Faultless.  A stay here is a must.  We will be going back.",5,2017,01,31
209,A Night at the Ballet,Very good but more attention to detail from the Staff at Breakfast (Only) would have made it the perfect stay.  Staff seemed disinterested.  The rest of the stay was perfect and to the expected standards of such a brand,5,2017,01,31
209,Afternoon tea,"Had a lovely afternoon tea. It was all very fresh and delicious. Nice touch to get a glass of orange as well as your tea. Very quiet venue despite being busy and we weren't rushed out. 

We booked and were accommodated when we arrived early plus the staff had a note of our booking dietary requirements and adjusted the menu accordingly.

Staff very friendly and helpful.",5,2017,01,30
209,Discovering a night of luxury in the city where you reside,"We were invited to a 40th birthday party in Dublin city center and as we live about 10 miles from the city centre we decided to treat ourselves to an overnight stay in town.  It was the BEST idea we had in a long time.  No queuing for taxis post party, just back to the bosom of this luxurious hotel for a superb nights' sleep.  We chose Conrad Dublin as it is central, but not in the 'crazy' part of town, so we knew we were close to the action, but would be guaranteed a decent noise-free night!  Also, we like the contemporary look. The staff were so friendly, akin to a country hotel - the kind of hospitality that puts you at ease the moment you step inside.   The hotel's refurbishment is stunning, nods to art-deco  with the 'no expense spared' look.  Our room was fabulous - large, bright, amazing city view plus the amenities were superb.  We enjoyed a cocktail in Lemuel's before heading to the party and were gland to return for a nightcap.  Alan the barman was so knowledgeable and recognized us on our return (always a good sign).   We had a super sleep in THE most comfortable bed imaginable - no street noise too really aided our slumber.  Breakfast next morning was excellent.  Great choice on the buffet and a la carte.   I highly recommend a night or two at Conrad Dublin - it is worth every penny.",5,2017,01,30
209,Excellent ,"Great room, nice view, helpful staff, well maintained and decent price. 
Breakfast nice although buffet area a little cramped. 
Also used conference facilities and found them to be be of good standard. 
Stayed with work and will be back. ",4,2017,01,29
209,"Wonderful city centre hotel, brilliant location","The Conrad, post a major refurbishment is an excellent hotel. A diverse and high standard food and beverage offering and the lower bar has a great craft beer selection. 

Above all this hotel is made by the remarkable service and attention to detail. Would thoroughly recommend the hotel. ",5,2017,01,28
209,All the extras,"Elegant hotel. It has in room massages if you schedule they are amazing. Wonderful showering products and newly refurbished rooms. We dropped our bags at 6:00 am before a day tour, when we arrived back to the hotel they were in already put in our room.",5,2017,01,27
209,Unbearably noisy room,"Expensive hotel with heavy machinery being operated all day in the guest room directly above mine, unacceptable at this price point.  I could not recommend this hotel on that basis alone.  No notification to me of any such planned works.",2,2017,01,26
209,Fabulous stay with the girls ,"Just back from a terrific weekend stay with the girls in Dublin and stayed at The Conrad Dublin. This is a fabulous hotel in a great location just off St Stephens Green. We had a great stay, lovely lunch in the Coburg, topped off with Champagne and cocktails in Lemuels. We are already thinking about when we can get back there.",5,2017,01,24
209,Just the right amount of luxury,"I stayed here for a weekend and found the hotel to be exactly what I wanted. It is a great location, easy to get to everywhere in Dublin. The concierge service was very helpful and arranged for my airport taxi and also for my dinner reservation. I would definitely stay here again!",5,2017,01,24
209,Nice but disappointed...,"First 5* hotel we've stayed in for a city break, was a bit disappointed. Requested a refurbished room when booking and was told all rooms had now been refurbished. Our room deffo didn't look refurbished and it wasn't much to shout about for a 5* hotel. The water pressure in the bathroom was poor too. Apart from that the rest of the hotel was lovely and service was great. Not sure I'd bother with 5* again though if this is all you get, expected more.",4,2017,01,24
209,Nigel,"Excellent in all aspects - would highly recommend . Staff helpful and efficent
Food was excellent for all meals and hotel had had an excellent refurbishment . Rooms were clean and spacious wilth all anenitues",5,2017,01,24
209,Great hotel,"I stayed at the Conrad for 2 nights to celebrate a birthday along with 7 friends. All rooms were upgraded on arrival and my room was upgraded 2 levels due to celebrating my birthday - a lovely touch! All rooms were together too. I received champagne and plate of macaroons along with a birthday card too! The hotel is in a great location with park, Grafton street and bars all within short walking distance. The hotel decor was stunning and was immaculate. The dining room was also lovely and the breakfast was gorgeous! One night before returning to the hotel after a night out we called the hotel to see if they did 24 hour room service. They took our orders over the phone and had it all laid out in a separate dining area for when we got back! Would definitely stay here again!",5,2017,01,23
209,"Central location, great for business and leisure",Nice comfortable rooms with all amenities; modern and well-maintained. Friendly service and great breakfast. Small but very important things like european sockets and complimentary water in the room. Will certainly come back.,5,2017,01,22
209,Wonderful true 5 star stay,"Thank you to all the kind, helpful and friendly staff at conrad for making our stay super special.  Our room had everything we needed and was truly a very comfortable and relaxing stay. The bed was so comfy and made to 5 star perfection. 
We had a wonderful time and felt so relaxed and refreshed. 
Matt in the hotel bar was fantastic and made us fab cocktails. Thank you.",5,2017,01,22
209,Top of the class and luxurious.,"It has always been one of my little aims to actually stay in a Conrad. Until very recently there was no Conrad in my home country and the closest one in Central Europe closed.

Anyhow I wanted to visit Dublin and as it happens there was a Conrad.

The initial reaction as my friend and myself entered was well unfortunately to be expected. The looking up and down at two very casually dressed people who obviously were not the normal clientele shall we say. 

However once they realised we were both HHonours Gold status the body language and attitude changed. 

We asked if our room was ready on the off chance it was. Unfortunately it was not but the staff did offer to store our bags and send them to the room when it was ready, which we accepted.

When I checked in later that afternoon, checkin process was fast and efficient and my gold status was mentioned and details about the complimentary breakfast was provided without me having to ask.

The room it's self was immaculate and was one of the newly refurbished rooms. So new in fact that there was still a slight whiff of paint! It was clean, tidy, and the sheets clean and also tidy. Someone even cleaned under the bed!!
However our bags were not in the room as promised, but this was very quickly rectified without any fuss and the bags bought up to the room. 

Shortly afterwards a welcome gift of chocolate macaroons was delivered to the room. Yum.

The beds were very comfortable. The TV worked! 

One thing which did disappoint me and is no fault of the frontline staff is the fact that the hotel did not sell the Conrad Branded bathrobes. A missed profit opportunity?   

The 747 airport express bus stops just outside and the aircoach just around the corner. ",5,2017,01,21
209,Marvellous stay,"Wow what a great hotel. True 5 stars, from the style, food, atmosphere to the services and comfort of the bed. Praise to the receptionists and concierge; they did anything to make our stay memorable. Thanks for the complimentary upgrade. Hope to be back in December again.",5,2017,01,21
209,Very easy and convenient hotel,"Service impeccable, refurbished suites needs a bit tweaking as it lacks drawers space.  No wardrobe or dresser space for clothing just a tiny closet and if you are there with family will definitely to improvise.  Staff at the front desk very informative and friendly.  ",5,2017,01,20
209,"Warm Welcome, Great Staff!","From the moment I arrived I felt very welcome and all the staff, without exception, were keen to help and ensure that our every need was met.  Our room was more than comfortable and the bar and restaurant areas were most inviting.  The location was also convenient.  I had been looking forward to the cooked breakfast but sadly it was very disappointing and almost inedible, not worthy of this 5* hotel.",4,2017,01,17
209,Allan Evans,"The hotel was lovely definitely 5 star
Rooms very nice, bar classy 
Within walking distance of temple bar
The pub. In the basement was great,good food, beer and atmosphere 
Staff very friendly 
St Stephens gardens 1 minute away
Highly recommended ",5,2017,01,17
209,Weekend get away,"Great hotel In good location, breakfast was great, staff very helpful ,bed was very large and was very comfortable, internet works very well in room. Hotel,is opposite st Stephens green very nice park to walk through on your way to temple bar ",5,2017,01,16

209,Absolutely Fabulous stay at the Conrad Dublin,"What an absolute treat to stay at this wonderful hotel.  The staff were friendly and helpful, and the refurbed rooms were beautiful, clean and the epitome of what you would expect from a world-class hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for accommodation in Dublin. My only regret is that we didn't get to stay longer.",5,2017,01,15
209,Exceptional service ,"Well located a stone's throw from St Stephen's Green the recently remodelled Conrad Hotel delivers its product with warmth and panache. 
Well trained staff at every level, lovely rooms, good breakfast and delicious cocktails. 
We stayed over Christmas and the hotel made a great effort to make everyone feel welcome and festive. Perhaps because it is less famous than some of Dublin's more celebrated hotels The Conrad seems to make up the difference with charm and enthusiasm. Great job. ",5,2017,01,11
209,Overnight for family event,"Stayed with my sister and her baby,  rang ahead to check re parking well ahead of check in,very welcoming and friendly staff which continued throughout our short stay. Cot provided,room was amazing slightly wished we could skip family party and enjoy room. Very comfortable sleep and lovely breakfast,  within walking distance of Grafton st. Would recommend without hesitation",4,2017,01,07
209,"great location, nice rooms","The stay at The Conrad Hotel was good: nice and spacious room, the location right next to St. Stephens Green great and nice breakfast, wonderful cosy bed. On the downside: the breakfast room was really cold, a little bit of heating would have been nice and our room (430) was a room, which could be connected to the neighbouring room. Because of this we could hear everything from the room the next door and especially when the neighbours started their little music party it was really loud and annoying. So just make sure to ask for an room without connecting doors and you will have a really nice stay at The Conrad in Dublin.",4,2017,01,07
209,New Conrad is amazing,The new lobby bar and rooms are fantastic and the service is second to none.  We stayed there for six nights over Christmas and could not be happier.  It's the perfect distance from Grafton street and does not get as crazy as other hotels.  Love the new room decor.,5,2017,01,07
209,Good but not perfect ,"Stayed here several times and it's always been excellent.  Newly refurbished rooms are wonderful.  Great meal in the bar. Easy walk through the park to the city. Something however really went wrong at breakfast time,  not enough staff, a rush of people, very little food available,  nobody to take our order, had to clear our own table.  Emailed hotel and they apologised. Hmm 5 star hotel and I'm Hilton Diamond HHONOURS member probably expect more. Should be right all the time. It's not cheap and there are alternatives. ",4,2017,01,06
209,excellent !!,"Véry close to bus stop (leeson street lower) for the airport
Very close from st stephene green and city center
A bit far (non walking distance) from temple bar
Excellent service
Very good breakfast and bed was fantastic
Excellent choice if you get a discount via expedia or booking
Go for breakfast before 8h30 unless you love queuiing and a disorganised service",5,2017,01,06
209,Quality from start to finish,"Location is great for a trip to Dublin and a fair price for what was a lovely experience. It was nice to be next to St Stephens Green for walks and there are lots of tourist attractions nearby. Rooms were very nice and what you would expect from a 5* hotel. We signed up for the bed and breakfast arrangement but also had lunch one day. The food was really good with lots of variety. The thing that stood out for me the most at the hotel was the exceptional customer service and quality of staff - every staff member I encountered was extremely helpful, courteous, sharp and made everything very easy. If you are looking for a luxury escape to Dublin, I would recommend the Conrad.",5,2017,01,06
209,"Great location, excellent service","The Conrad is located in South central Dublin, just opposite the National Concert Hall and a short walk across St Stephen's Green from the main shopping centre of the city in Grafton Street. Recently refurbished the rooms are comfortable, well quipped, and a good size, and service is all you expect from this brand. Staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast is excellent. Car parking is available underneath the hotel. Perhaps a little expensive, but a great spot to stay.",4,2017,01,05
209,Good stay.,"Good stay staff very helpful. Room very good, only thing was the quality of wine glass at dinner (very cheep I was taught they might bread if we toasted with them). Breakfast was hard to work out but the food was very good and a good choice.",4,2017,01,04
209,Elegance and Luxury,"A prime spot in town. A beautiful hotel where the staff are charming, helpful and professional .
Breakfast is excellent is the lobby bar. 
Rooms are spacious and modern. 
Also I found for it's great location it wasn't expensive in comparison to nearby hotels. 
The Conrad is a top Hilton hotel. 
I shall be back again . ",5,2017,01,04
209,Fantastic stay in Dublin city,"I stayed here with my family from late December to January . We loved it. The location was fantastic as was the hotel . Everything was new , modern and very clean. I loved the gym. The food was great and the staff could not have been nicer . ",5,2017,01,03
209,Great Value and Prime Location,"Propertybis close the St Stephen's Square, the light rail LUAS line and several great restaurants, e.g. Hugo's. The Pub on property was great fun and the overall food experience was great. Staff was very attentive, excellent room service.",5,2017,01,03

209,Fantastic hotel with amazing friendly staff,Lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin close to St Stephens green park which the kids loved very close to the shops which I loved. Great food in the restaurant with friendly helpful staff . Easy quick check out with a take away breakfast as our departure was before 7 ,5,2017,01,01
209,Class and elegance from start to finish,All staff from desk clerks to maids are professional and helpful. Food is delicious and location is favorable to getting to see the town!! The rooms are beautiful and exceptionally clean! Front desk staff are more than happy to make suggestions about what to do and where to go ,5,2016,12,31
209,Really enjoyable stay,"We had two nights here and were very happy with the hotel.  We arrived very early but were still able to check in.  The room we were given smelled very strongly of cigarette smoke so my husband went down to speak to reception.  They were very apologetic, immediately changed the room and sent someone up to help us with our bags. (Smoking is not permitted but the chambermaid later told us that there had been some very badly behaved teenagers in the room).

The second room was absolutely fine:  spacious and well equipped.  (Lots of sockets).  The bathroom was very nice, with loads of towels and facecloths, nice toiletries, and the much-appreciated bathrobes and slippers.  Oh, and the breakfasts were awesome.

Nothing was too much trouble for the staff.  Great location for shopping and restaurants - would stay here again.",5,2016,12,30
209,Wonderful Stay in Dublin to put an end of my trip,"Only stayed in this hotel for last 3 nights of my trip in Dublin but I should have stayed in this hotel way before.
Love this hotel with modern and cool design and its very spacious room and spacious bathroom!
I like their design that I can actually open the window of my room so sometimes I can turn off the air-con and get some fresh air to my room!
Breakfast is awesome as well but the breakfast place is quite hot as its design makes it like a green house if it is a sunny day.
Anyway I also like their Conrad 1-2-3 experience (it stands for the no. of hours of the experience duration).
We tried the 1-hour experience which is actually a picnic in the near park.
Table / Chairs / food / drinks are all prepared by the hotel staff and they will also standby to serve you.
Very interesting way to experience local culture, wish I have more spare time to try their 2 and 3 hours ones.
This Dublin Conrad also has a very popular bar downstairs, very crowded everyday from 4 or 5 pm and it has it's very own local brand of beer instead of Guinness.
Anyway I love its location as well - not really located within the city centre but only 10 mins walk through the St. Stephen Garden.
Al the staffs are very helpful, nice and friendly!",5,2016,12,28
209,"Nice hotel, friendly staff",Nice hotel. Stayed one night. Good facilities for a conference. Rooms were fine but the one I stayed in needed updating. Friendly and helpful staff - helped me to retrieve a charger I left in the room after I checked out. Room service was quick and tasty. Would return.,4,2016,12,28
209,Much Better Than Expected,"Chain hotels are predicable; that is one of the benefits and also one of the drawbacks.  You can usually rely on your basic needs being fulfilled, but you shouldn't expect many surprises, good or bad.

The Conrad Dublin exceeded all expectations.  The staff was exceedingly helpful and friendly, the breakfasts were terrific (and complementary to Gold and Diamond members), the rooms better than average (far larger than the typical European hotel room), and the amenities were first-rate.

The location is terrific, just off St. Stephen's Green and all sites were walkable.

Unless one insists on the smaller, boutique hotel (and I do understand that insistence), I can recommend Conrad Dublin.",5,2016,12,25
209,A Great Stay in Dublin,"A really Gem of a Hotel. It all works well, like a charm. I was very pleased with all amenities, staff, ad location. Price is a bit steep for Dublin.  The breakfast, in particular, was a Five Star experience.",5,2016,12,23
209,Complete Luxury,"I recently stayed in the Conrad because my work Christmas party was being held there. I have to say I had an absolutely wonderful time; the hotel is absolutely beautiful.

I stayed for two nights here, the rooms are perfectly clean; complete luxury, soft linen, amazingly soft pillows and duvets, a range of bathing and beauty products, a newspaper left daily outside the door and the breakfast was incredible!

I had two wonderful nights of sound sleep followed by a huge range for the breakfast. A buffet including a usual fry, continental breakfast, yogurts, smoothies, muffins, cheeses etc...along with an option to order additional food from the menu I had the french toast and Belgian waffles which were perfect!

Overall wonderful place to stay if you want to treat yourself and I will be staying again.",5,2016,12,23
209,"New, clean, modern, with great staff","The Conrad has been entirely renovated and is a popular conference and business hotel.  Americans might want to think of it as roughly equivalent to a Hyatt.  We stayed here for a conference and found everything about it to be entirely satisfactory but very little was truly remarkable.  The location, off St. Stephan’s Green, is convenient to many tourist attractions and many good restaurants.  The staff were great.  Breakfasts were enjoyable.  The rooms have been newly redone and they are comfortable and spotlessly clean.  Two things were truly memorable.  First, the staff did everything they could to satisfy all of our requests, even when we couldn't figure out what we really wanted — it is not easy to book good-to-great restaurants in Dublin the week before Christmas, but the Concierge team were very helpful.   And Galway Bay Craft Brewers have a brewpub in the basement of the hotel!  They had about 20 taps, including their own beers, other Irish craft beers, and a few other well-selected beers, at all times.  They had a large selection of bottled beers.  And they had really good traditional American and Irish pub food.  Finding a top craft beer brewpub in the basement of a business traveler’s hotel was an unexpected delight.  The Conrad is not a great hotel, in the sense that the Oriental in Bangkok or the George V in Paris or the Bristol in Vienna are great hotels.  But it is a very good hotel.",4,2016,12,22
209,"Excellent service, great location","This hotel is conveniently located near St. Stephen's Green, walking distance from shopping, restaurants, and pick up points for tour operators.  Hotel staff is extremely helpful and polite.  Daily, complimentary shoe shine is a nice touch!  Rooms are a bit ""tired looking"" for the price, but the quality of towels and bed linen is excellent.  In-house dining is OK, but welcome when all outside restaurants are booked.  Breakfast is good.",5,2016,12,21
209,Excellent stay at the Conrad,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Conrad. The hotel was Christmas themed and smelled lovely of pine. The room I stayed in was clean, modern, and had a great bed.  The internet was not as fast as I hoped and I was unable to watch the most recent episode of the apprentice. However I was able to download it over night. The room wasn't too noisy and had a nice view.",5,2016,12,20
209,Great Folks! Great Service,"Checked in for a two night layover on the way home at the tail end of an extended vacation. Upon arrival we were pleasantly welcomed to The Conrad by Ivana at the HH's check-in desk. Informative, knowledgeable and super nice person. We were off to a good start! We were looking for a relaxing evening and found a jewel in the heart of Dublin, the hotel bar 'Lemuel's Lounge Bar'. The team behind the bar, led by one of the best mixologists and most knowledgeable historians of fine whiskey (Allen, the manager) made our stay memorable. They knew what we needed...good food, good drink and good service. The bartenders, Daniel and Richard made us feel at home with the proper amount of attention and a great read of their customers. This bar is a must see in Dublin. Room service and after hours attention were also top notch. Rooms comfortable, clean and quiet. Please tell Allen at Lemuel's we sent you!",5,2016,12,19
209,Superb hotel,"I stayed at Conrad during one of my business trips to Dublin and everything was amazing! The hotel is recently refurbished, food is delicious and Alfie's (i.e. the pub downstairs) has an incredibly nice variety of craft beers. The staff was incredibly helpful, in particular Nick from food & beverage who took care of me through all of the journey. He prepared and delivered an amazing breakfast every morning and his attitude and manners are exemplary. Conrad is by far the best hotel in town. I will come back.",5,2016,12,19
209,First Class Stay,Our stay was very enjoyable from start to finish. We found the staff very friendly and obliging throughout our stay. Nothing was a problem and everything catered for from the moment we arrived right through to our departure five star service....,5,2016,12,19
209,Excellent hotel with nice spacious room,"Although not located in a central area, the hotel is within walking distance to the shopping area along Grafton Street. It has excellent facilities. Room is really spacious, breakfast selection is wonderful. Staff are really friendly and helpful.",5,2016,12,18
209,"Great kocation, staff lovely","Friends had a lovely stay here - food was lovely, staff so friendly and good atmosphere in the bar although the drink was a little expensive avg €10 spirit and mixer. Would definitely stay here again :)",5,2016,12,16
209,"Good hotel, great location","We have stayed on the conrad previously, the refurbished rooms on our previous visit where fab, otherwise the rooms are very suitable. Great location to walk to St Stephens green or Grafton Street. The €20 parking charge is a little excessive for guests so factor into your stay and comparrisions",4,2016,12,15
209,Weekend stay at the Conrad,"My wife and I stayed at the Conrad in Dublin for our annual pre Christmas weekend away.  It was the first time we stayed at the Conrad and we were both really impressed with the hotel, staff, food, room, bathrooms etc.  We will most certainly be staying at this hotel again in the future.",5,2016,12,15
209,Just OK,"Full disclosure, I am a Hilton Honors member, albeit  slowly Silver level. That said, I was a little disappointed that I did not get a refurbished room (2nd floor). The room was ok--worn--and not what I'm used to from the Conrad brand. However, the bed was sumptuous. 100 percent on that, and after walking the City all day, it was nice to come back to that. I did find the staff to be helpful and gracious, even housekeeping--no complaints there, and while I rarely if ever use in-room coffee machines, I did use the Nespresso and found it to be enjoyable for an initial quick cup of coffee. 

The location of the hotel is a little off the beaten path, and the next time I'm in Dublin I might try the DoubleTree which seems to be more at the center of it all.

Not a bad stay, just ok--a bit of a surprise from Conrad.",3,2016,12,15
209,Visiting a family member. Beautiful hotel in a nice location. Needs to pay attention to guests details.,This is a lovely hotel who just needs to just pay attention to the guests needs or requests. There are no drawers to place your clothing and a lot of wasted space.  No single chair to sit at the desk. Redesign could have been better. ,3,2016,12,14
209,Dirty rooms Dirty beds,"Late arrival so there should be no excuses, room was dirty and the bead had not been changed and that's not all, there was a dirty E cigarette with lipstick 💄 on it laying on the floor right beside the bed 👿Very disappointed",1,2016,12,14
209,Wonderful hotel for a weekend break - or anytime,"This is a hotel with lovely, attentive staff and a great, well-equipped bedroom.  Great views over the city too.  Restaurant was good for dinner and for breakfast.  Convenient underground car park.  Convenient for getting around Dublin.",5,2016,12,14
209,"CONRAD IS USUALLY GREAT, BUT NOT THIS ONE! CAREFUL!!!  3 Star at the most!","As Diamond members we were VERY disappointed.  Shabby furniture, toilet  had the wrong size seat on it. Heaters broken. Uncaring.. No other rooms available, poor excuses = bad experiences.  BE CAREFUL.

We travel a lot but until now had never been to Ireland.  This was our first trip to Ireland, so we booked a short stay at Ashford Castle and finished the trip at the Conrad in Dublin.  (2 rooms for 3 nights)  We are Diamond members with Hilton and have always had excellent experiences staying with Conrad hotels so we felt we could trust we would have a great experience. There is a first for everything and this is the first time I have been truly disappointed with a Conrad Hotel.  We checked into the room and was given a room that was in my opinion looked like what you would find at a 2.5 – 3 star hotel.  The furniture had seen better days.  Surprisingly even the toilet  had the wrong size seat on it.  When I asked to change rooms they said, ""Sorry. No other rooms available, try in the morning.""  Ok I can understand this, so we did not unpack our luggage..  Back at the room we could not get the heater to work but we thought we must be doing something wrong since both rooms had the same issue so we went to bed thinking we just did not know how to work the Controls.  It was a chilly night but we persevered.  Next morning I asked about changing rooms or an upgrade with our Hilton Diamond status. They would see what they could do while we were out.  Off we went to sight see for the day.  Returning to the room that evening - Sorry no upgrade or other rooms available, but likely tomorrow.  Ok we understand, still did not unpack.  Had room service for dinner.  (They forgot part of the order, but stuff happens.  They brought the missing items up later).  Started to feel a chill again in both of our rooms and still could not figure out how to get the heat on.  Since we could not get either room heaters to work we called to have someone come to show us how to turn the heat on. Had to call again when no one showed up to help.  Finally a nice housekeeping person showed up.  Said the heating system is ""broken"". She explained that the workers who have been fixing the heat problems in the building had left for the day & had we of reported it in the problem on the morning they could have helped.  (Wow.  This tells me they knew about the problems and it sounded as though some of it is now our fault now for not reporting sooner)  She then proceeded to explain that they had remodeled most of the other floors and they should get to our floor in January. (Not sure how this was this supposed to make me feel better right then.)  She offered to send up two heaters for the night and assured us they would work on fixing it tomorrow while we were out. I decide I had had enough with these 2 rooms so I went down to see if we can change rooms. (Once again!) The desk person said he would come to the room in 10 minutes.   When he came I decided to show him some of the other issues in the room that were just NOT right for a 5 star Conrad.  One of the bathrooms toilet seat was the wrong size for the toilet, worn furniture etc.  His reply for the toilet seat was ""This WAS the correct size.  It was just how they made replacement seats.  I almost laughed.  We are real estate developers. That excuse was so
 clearly wrong that actually it was almost laughable. It sounded like something you might say to someone you think is an inexperienced female thinking they will believe you.  It looked like they had the used a regular size seat on  an elongated toilet bowl.  He also explained that they had finished remodeling most of the other floors but would not be doing our floor until later.  I again wondered why in the world anyone would say this to us.   They basically are saying they know our room is filled with problems that eventually it will be fixed, but you picked the wrong time to come here. This from a supposed 5 star Conrad?   I expect better if for no other reason than the hotel is a part of the Conrad chain.  Bottom line was; Sorry no other rooms available tonight, no promises but we will see what we can do tomorrow.  Can I offer you free drinks?   (No thank you on the drinks. I just want a smooth calm experience that you expect from a Conrad 5 star hotel.)  He said he would note the file and try to help with this for us tomorrow.  (No promises, but he would try.  Still never unpacked...)

My husband and I were both disappointed in the entire situation.  Rather than focusing on a wonderful trip with our 2 granddaughters, we are focused on the poor service and quality of this hotel and OUR poor decision in choosing the DUBLIN CONRAD  at apparently the wrong time.  It was very upsetting to say the least.

End result was the next morning before leaving to explore the City we stopped at the front desk. We inquired to learn what they were doing about changing rooms while we were out.  The person at the desk looked up our 2 rooms and there were NO notes in the file from ANY of our concerns or inquiries.  She had no knowledge that anything was wrong.   So instead of starting our day on a positive, we were even more frustrated... We explained the situation and she did explain more fully the situation and tried to see what she could do.  We left for our days adventure.  

The end of the situation is we were given $100 off of our $1500 overall stay. I guess it is a gesture, but honestly ruining our first time experience with the granddaughters in Ireland was sad.  The day manager did give us a nice letter saying if we returned in the future she would make sure we had a newly remodeled room.  Neither makes up for the loss of positive memories and experiences.  

I did not mention the breakfast with no drinks or other minor issues that came up, but those things would begin to sound petty...  Bottom line is it all added up to MUCH less than the expected 5 star service.)   

I have NEVER posted a negative review, but this time I felt others should be made aware of the problems.   For those thinking to book before they finish remodeling, USE CAUTION.  They advertise they have great newly remodeled rooms, but if a DIAMOND member that is loyal has this much trouble here, it makes you wonder how lucky you might be.

Trips with grandchildren should be about creating priceless memories. Sadly this was a 'not so good memory' they will not soon forget, nor will I.",2,2016,12,13
209,Superb renovation of the Conrad,"We arrived at the hotel and were amazed with the Christmas decoration. It seems the porters and receptionist were already waiting for us, such was the greeting. The room is large, luxurious and welcoming. I like the huge TV which is at the same discrete. The bed is very inviting with 3 huge pillows, fabulous bed linen. The breakfast room is very relaxing and we would congratulate on its design.",5,2016,12,13
209,Beautiful place to stay,Recently stayed here for a business trip to Dublin.  The staff was very helpful.  The food in the restaurant was excellent.  Clean and spacious room.  Business center well equipped with everything I needed.  I will definitely stay here again.,5,2016,12,11
209,Very nice hotel close to the city center but in a calm place,"It is a very nice a comfortable hotel faraway from the confusion and noise in the heart of Dublin. As a Diamond member I was upgraded to a very good room and English/continental breakfast. The room was spacious, with a lot of amenities and tv had sky sports. Breakfast was very very good and the environment of the restaurant was perfect. The only thing I need to refer as negative is the lack of Swimming pool and Executive Lounge. Said that, it was an amazing  stay!",5,2016,12,11
209,Impeccable Service,"The customer service which I received on a recent stay at the Conrad in Dublin was without flaw.  From the moment of ""check in"" to the moment of ""check out,"" the hotel provided only the best of service.  Room service dishes and trays were whisked away as soon as they were emptied.  My experiences in the hotel restaurant were equally excellent.  Each hotel staff member went out of their way to be helpful and courteous.  My room accommodation was lovely. I highly recommend this hotel and plan to return there on my next Dublin trip.",5,2016,12,10
209,my trip to Dublin,My reservations indicated room will be ready at 3 in the afternoon I arrived at 6 a.m. and I was given my room after a night travel from Hartford Connecticut and my first time in Dublin what a pleasant surprised I was able to take a few hours nap freshen up before my first meeting finally to the final hail of a cab to the airport nice experience,5,2016,12,08
209,Sister's birthday weekend,From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were made feel very welcome from the gentlemen parking the car to bringing our bags up to the rooms check in was very efficient  the rooms are beautifully decorated and the most comfortable beds breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice must mention Danny the manager and Gary 2 really  professional guys Ailfie Byrne's  bar s perfect for a greats night's craic with great range of beers from around the world and the cocktail bar just off the lobby is perfect for a glass of wine can't recommend this hotel enough just minutes from St Stephen's  Green  and Grafton Street,5,2016,12,07
209,Excellent Pre-Christmas Trip Away,"We spent a 2-night stay at the Conrad Dublin 2nd-4th December and I must stay it was truly fantastic!! The hotel has recently been refurbished and from the moment we entered we were ‘blown away’ by the interior and luxurious feel. The staff were courteous throughout our stay and obviously very well trained. We were given a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe room that was also refurbished, and it was so wonderful- I really loved the in-room Nespresso machine and bedside ihome system.   We enjoyed every element of our stay in this hotel, including the food/drink, and the relaxing ambiance. We will definitely return to stay again…let’s hope sooner rather than later!",5,2016,12,05
209,Excellent Christmas break,"A lovely weekend in the city of Dublin with our family, 2 adults and 2 children. Great staff, wonderful Christmas atmosphere from the front desk to the restaurant, fantastic service. Good location, very friendly staff.  We'll be back!",5,2016,12,05
209,Wonderful hotel with fantastic breakfast,"Beautiful hotel, very close by from the centre. Amazing service and fantastic breakfast - i think the best breakfast i ever had in a hotel. Comfortable rooms with very comfy beds. I will definitely come back when Im in town.",5,2016,12,05
209,Excellent staff. Excellent standards,"The staff were extremely helpful. Nothing was too much. The standards from the moment you step through the door are extremely high. Quality of food at breakfast, to dinner in the restaurant is very good.  The conference rooms were well serviced,and set a very professional tone for our company as well as for the hotel itself.  I look forward to conducting company training here in the future.",5,2016,12,04
209,Great hotel ,"We stayed in this lovely hotel for 2 nights while doing our Christmas shopping. The hotel is busy but quiet at night which was perfect for us. A short walk to grafton street 
The staff are friendly and helpful but their air conditioning has a mind of its own
Breakfast is very good but very busy ",5,2016,12,04
209,Good location,"Hotel is good, great location near the Stephens Green Park. Room was nice, bed was good. Bathroom had a funny smell, nothing gross, and not bad enough to make me change rooms.
The park is lovely and there are lots of shops and great restaurants on the other side of it. There are some cafes nearby, try the Emer's Kitchen, they have amazing scones!",4,2016,12,03
209,A great nights sleep!,"We arrived late to a rainy Dublin, the bellhop and reception were lovely.  We were shown to our newly renovated room, which was like being at home, everything you could want, and the bed was super comfy!!  Restaurants and bars all themed are fun.  Position is super, walking distance to most things.",5,2016,12,01
209,3 nights in Dublin on business. Falls short of expectations set by the brand. Not my cup of tea.,"The Conrad Dublin rates ""Average' because it needs to be refurbished. It was far from meeting my expectations. It is conveniently located.  Service never bad but uneven ranging from great to just okay. The room was spotless well maintained but felt dated with older furniture and rather drab colors. The comfortable bed on wheels kept rolling away from the headboard as I slept. Good pillows and good linen. The shower is a hybrid shower/bath setup which I hate. Internet was at extra cost and reliably fast. Breakfast as expected as such nothing special. Dinner was too busy for the staff on hand. Service was a bit too slow and rather chaotic. Opposite of relaxing or enjoyable. Menu adequate and the cod I had was good but one dish I ordered was forgotten. If there is a next time I'll use room service.",3,2016,11,30
209,Dublin Favourite,"Regular visitors to Dublin and the Conrad has always been our favourite, not always easy to get a room...one night stay this visit using points and cash gave us a very good rate for a King bed room. Believe the room refurbishment still ongoing and the newly designed lobby area, bar and bistro is very stylish. Very comfortable room with excellent amenities and a very good sized bathroom with a shower over bath. Room also comes with Nespresso machine and iPod dock...Wi Fi good strength and large flat screen tv with plenty of channels, heat for the room also worked. Overall a very good stay although rate did not nclude breakfast, we did take dinner in the new bistro which I have reviewed seperately. Always a plus here are the staff and there is always a friendly welcome and a helping hand form the door to the rest of the hotel...well recomended...",5,2016,11,30
209,Disappointing,"We have stayed in this hotel before and found it to be of excellent standard (1 year ago)

However on this occasion we found that while the infrastructure has not changed the atmosphere has.

The breakfast was smaller and of a worse quality than in the past.  The breakfast staff were eager to clear away reading material, but not to clear dishes.  They were hard to get the attention of, even though the restaurant was not particularly busy.

Later when I mentioned to the front staff that we were disappointed with the breakfast the response was ""I'll tell the chef"" and walked then turned away from us, without even asking why we were disappointed.

A poor experience compared with prior visits.",3,2016,11,30
209,Exceptional location and service,"Fantastic location great food and superb staff could not go enough for us just the best 

Lunch excellent and the whole stay very relaxing 

We were in Dublin for the rugby both the All Blacks and Aussie stayed here too with us ",5,2016,11,30
209,Quick 1 x night Stay,"The Conrad Dublin is a great hotel. Excellent staff greet you and take care of you throughout the hotel, superb Irish hospitality, easy walking distance to Grafton Street and beyond. The bedrooms are nice and light and have super comfortable beds and bedding. Cleanliness 10/10.",5,2016,11,29
209,"Nice experience, friendly staff","After booking a room we sent a mail asking for a refurbished room. When we got there it turned out that none were available for the first 2 nights (some conference had filled up the hotel), but that we could get one the last night. A bit disappointed we went to our room, but ended up staying there the whole stay. The rooms are spacious, and while not refurbished decent enough. 
We were very impressed by the friendliness of the staff - from front desk, concierge to the breakfast restaurant. We thought we had forgotten something in the room, and they took action immediately and gave rapid response.
The location is within walking distance to key museums and the Grafton street shopping district, while at the same time absolutely quiet at night.",4,2016,11,28
209,Perfect place to stay for holiday or business,"Loved this hotel - from the warm welcome on the desk, to the lovely hotel room, to a fabulous breakfast with friendly staff. Felt really well looked after. Dressing gown and the best slippers in any hotel I've stayed in, really comfy bed and lots of pillows, heated glass in bathroom for morning face preparation, socket by bed - all the things that matter to me in hotel! 
Not sure how great the location is, view from my room wasn't great. Bonus for having the Australian rugby team there when I stayed so view from bar was lovely ;)",4,2016,11,28
209,Very professional staff,"Good location short walk to shopping and Temple bar area  , top recommendations for touring,   quality food for a conference . Great craft beer bar in the lower level.  Quality that you would expect from the Conrad ",5,2016,11,27
209,Very Nice Experience for a Business Trip,"I enjoyed this hotel for a business trip.  The room was clean and well appointed, the staff were friendly and helpful, and the restaurant was good.
Its location was perfect for my meetings, but if I were there for sightseeing, I think the location of some other Dublin hotels would be marginally better.",4,2016,11,27
209,Is this hotel actually part of HHilton Honors Programme????????,"If you are a gold or diamond member do not, do not waste your loyalty here. Understand that upgrades are not always available but have never been told as a diamond member that they are available for a fee. Also never had free breakfast arrangements like this in European Hilton properties. No lounge but not allowed to simply avail of main breakfast arrangements. Have stayed in all other Hilton properties in Dublin except airport. All give soooooo much more recognition to diamonds and golds. Please check some of my reviews - you will see I am always inclined to report on the positive but there is a reason why people manipulate their schedule to achieve elite status with a loyalty programme. Dublin Conrad just makes you feel like a sucker for having done so. Have written to Hhonors to complain - a first for me!",1,2016,11,24
209,A 5 star experience,"The Conrad hotel provides a truly impeccable experience, from the polite, friendly staff through to the immaculate bedrooms. We have stayed there numerous times and it is our hotel of choice when we visit Dublin. The decor is very stylish throughout the hotel and the sumptuous feel makes it a very relaxing stay. I used the gym this time and it is a very well equipped area with complimentary water, fruit and towels. The breakfast is always of a very high standard and this time, upon entry to the dining area we were offered fresh juice shots made with fruits and vegetables. They were delicious! The staff are very accommodating, mannerly and courteous and will try to help in any way they can. The hotel is a short leisurely stroll to the centre of Dublin and the hub of many places of interest. I am really looking forward to our next weekend of rest and relaxation!",5,2016,11,24
209,Wonderful-except the food.,"The hotel was wonderful and the service exceptional, however the the room service was not up to standard with the remainder of the hotel. The food was bland, and not worth the cost. 

The bar and reception staff deserve medals for dealing with the hectic and busy times and did so in a smooth and efficient manner.",4,2016,11,21
209,A true luxury hotel,"This hotel is situated within a 5 minute walk from the city centre. Its interior looks straight out from an IKEA catalogue, with great design and taste.

The check in was flawless and always with a smile. The room we stayed in was big, comfortable and with loads of little amenities. A big thumbs up for the slippers, they are extremely warm and comfy :)

The breakfast was really nice. The buffet is medium sized and well stocked and additional items can be ordered from a menu at no extra cost. The triple cheese omelette is to die for!

Apart from the lack of swimming pool, this hotel is one of the finest we have stayed in the Hilton brand and we will surely book it again :)",5,2016,11,18
209,Posh Hotel,"Stayed here while exploring Dublin for a few days. Cannot say better things about the staff. Upon check in the bellman suggested that we book a hop on hop off tour of the city, he took care of the booking. We had a blast.  The rooms in the hotel were updated and posh. Beds were comfortable. We enjoyed sitting in the bar next to the lobby which had a DJ. Overall 5 stars!!!",5,2016,11,15
209,Very nice hotel and staff,"We stayed here for one night last weekend, We had very good customer service and a very comfortable room to stay in. We were able to check in early and the room was very good, Danny the doorman had asked the bar man if we could have the rugby on in the bar on the -1 floor and that was agreed. The Bar has a great selection of local and Irish craft beers. Breakfast was very nice. Pity we couldn't stay longer.",5,2016,11,15
209,Wouldn't say it is a 5*,"Stayed here for 5 nights for a conference in October and while I had heard that there  had been a huge upgrade of rooms, we certainly weren't in a refurbished room which was very dissappointing when so many rooms had been booked.
Everything was really clean, most staff were friendly and breakfast was super. 

Staff in bar downstairs were not very attentive and we had to ask a number of them before we were served.

Good location within walking distance of Dublin centre which was great.",3,2016,11,15
209,A wonderful hotel,"From the online check to the express checkout the whole experience was wonderful. The staff all pleasant and above and beyond helpfull,cant wait to go back next year.its central to the busy shops  but far enough away to be peaceful also stands next door to a very lovely park perfect for a stroll ",5,2016,11,15
209,Top Class,"We had a very pleasant stay here for one night. We arrived back to the hotel after being out to a concert and we were hungry! We ordered room service as it was after 11.00pm and within 10 minutes our food arrived!! Excellent!
Breakfast was lovely with plenty of food to choose from. As we were checking out we met the Guest Relations Manager Danny, whom we met two years ago in the Conrad in Dubai.... who was extremely helpful then and also on this occasion. It was lovely meeting up with him again.",5,2016,11,14
209,Outstanding Customer Service,The staff at the Conrad made our trip easy and comfortable. They were so helpful and the hotel is perfectly located to get arround Dublin by foot. Our room came with the breakfast and that was an added bonus to. Start the day with friendly staff and a hot meal. Highly recommend!!,5,2016,11,14
209,Very hospitable,"Had a very comfy stay with this hotel, the bed was very comfortable one of the best sleeps I've had in a while, selection of food and drink on the room service menu was good with a very reasonable service charge, they even gave us chilled water with our cheese board and we did not order this. The breakfast was delicious with very friendly staff working both days we were there, only negative is that they didn't have baked beans with the cooked breakfast option, but that was a minor issue. Lady on reception was very friendly we had the same lady on check in and check out made us feel very welcome. The parking was handy lots of spaces to choose from even over the wknd price was a bit expensive for two days but then we accepted this as the hotel is more or less central to the city so we didn't expect it to be any less about 20 euros for 24 hours. On check in I ordered Strawberrys with chocolate they came to the room promptly after we checked in they were very nice and the room had a fridge so we could keep them chilled for later, the bathroom had a set of scales which I thought was a bit random never seen that before in a hotel.",4,2016,11,13
209,Truly a 5* experience!,"I must say that I couldn't have been happier with the hotel. Following its whopping €13m  refurbishment   you can feel the class and elegance when you enter the lobby. The team were so welcoming and helpful, our room was stunning (626) and the bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've slept in. The bath taps and shower pressure were great and the temperature was easy to adjust and was hot as opposed to warm! You have all the usual facilities in the room. Breakfast was great and they have a ""pub"" on the lower ground floor with a pool table, big screens, a football table and a great menu! (I recommend the burger). Key team members I want to specifically recognise are:

The brunette receptionist who checked us in with the English accent (I didn't catch her name!) was a delight and really made us feel so welcome and acknowledged our HHonors status. Even though we arrived at around 9am, she was able to get us a room which was great, having been up since before 4am. 

Dan the GRM - Dan walked us to the lift and was asking us about our stay and what our plans were and he actually came in the lift with us and took us directly to our room, explaining where everything was on the way, such as one of the bars, the restaurant etc. What a charming man and congrats again on the marathon!

Natasha (Natasa?) checked us out and although we were so sad to leave, her smile brightened up our day and she seemed genuinely interested in how our stay was and arranged for concierge to hold our bags until we left for the airport at 3pm. 

Gary at Concierge has a contagious smile. Every time we left the hotel he would appear from nowhere and open the door for us, ensuring to wish us a pleasant day. I saw that he had a 25 year pin on his jacket and I was hardly surprised. He had the warmth of hospitality oozing from him. 

The hotel is in a fantastic location too; a mere 5 minute walk through St Stephens Green Park, which has a fountain, lake etc, will see you at one of the main roads for hop-on-hop-off buses which are £10 for 24 hours and takes you around Dublin. There are a wealth of pubs and bars to try our AND, the hotel is a 5 minute walk from the Dawson Lounge which is officially the smallest pub in Dublin and well worth a visit. All in all, a 5* experience and I shall most certainly be returning in the future.",5,2016,11,10
209,One night in Dublin on Business,"Excellent hotel, great location. 5 minutes walk from the center of Dublin, but still very quiet in the rooms at night. I've stayed a couple of times and always in a refurbished room, great service and the food in the restaurant - breakfast and dinner is really good.",5,2016,11,08

209,Great hotel in a great location,"Very good experience from a well recognized brand. Quite and clean room with a very comfy bed, plush towels and a Nespresso coffee maker. 
Breakfast was included and it didn't fail to impress: great variety of both sweet and savoury options, fresh fruit juice and of course friendly service.
Would definitely return on my next trip to Dublin.",4,2016,11,05
209,A True Emerald on the Isle,"We recently travelled to Dublin and had the great houour of staying at the Conrad, Dublin. This Hotel is in the top 3 that we have ever stayed at.  It's staff is second to none in knowledge, and friendliness.  The property is well appointed, from the Luxurious Rooms to the Beautiful Dining Room to the Bar/Restaurant facility.  with all of the choices to eat and drink at we chose, after very busy days to relax in the Conrad's Dining Room and Bar facilities every evening, for 5 days.  The Food is wonderfully prepared, presented and valued.  The property is centrally located and close to every historic and scenic item Dublin has to offer. we will return every time we visit Dublin!  Thank you Conrad this property is top of our list.",5,2016,11,04
209,Great hotel in Dublin,"The Conrad was a great place to stay.  Easy check in, luxurious room, great food for all meals and helpful and professional staff. The breakfast selection was wide and there were great choices for health food options.  Afternoon tea was a delight.  Dinner was scrumptious.  It is close to St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street.  I was visiting on business but would go back to enjoy a vacation there anytime.",5,2016,11,04
209,Mr. Conrad met our expectations ,"Stayed here for a business trip. Great hotel in downtown Dublin, close to everything, which saved us a lot in taxi bills. We walked everywhere. Hotel is clean and tidy, service is above average, rooms are roomy and light. Breakfast was really good. 
Will stay here again. ",4,2016,11,04
209,Best experience,"This is a wonderful hotel. The location is outstanding and the staff is the best. I received the free breakfast as a Gold Honors member. It was consistent and lovely. More than any other detail about my stay, I would like to say the staff is as good a staff as I can remember. Simply lovely.",5,2016,11,03
209,"Diamond member, v regular visitor - now under new management who need to pay for the costly renovations and are surly ..","I stay here regularly and have spent €€€€ over the years. All the old staff are gone since the summer, it's under new management. My last visit in August/September I put down to teething problems - an example if you are a diamond member and want full breakfast (which always was complimentary as they don't have an executive lounge), you now unless you want to pay full price are sent into the bar, where a bad mannered young waitress who has zilch training tells everyone look at the menu the prices are listed, the ""complimentary food"" is v basic and not much either.  The message is either pay in full or go away and unfortunately that hasn't changed in two months. Also the old management always gave at least two complimentary drink vouchers to use in the bar. Two months ago I didn't receive any. This visit I didn't receive any. I had to ask twice and then v begrudging I was given two. When I tried to use them the curt bar waiter told me its house wine only and the cheapest. In the past with the old management they allowed a wine of choice. 

Today I am having breakfast in the dining room. The surly manager is walking u and down IGNORING all the guests as are the staff. With the old management, the restaurant manager used to greet me by name, each visit and chat.  This time nothing to anyone. The message is pay as much as possible for as little service and friendless as possible.

New management a friendly bit of advice - people are loyal because they enjoy the experience, are welcomed and treated well. Your new junior employees who are encouraged to sneer at customers and be rude (with good old fashioned Dublin humour laughing at guests) would not be allowed in a normal 2star hotel. Guess you are paying less to recoup the expensive renovations and guess you are telling staff ensure each guest pays as much as possible.  Well guess what this may work in the short term longer term though your hotel won't have returning guests especially as there are many many hotels in Dublin all similarly priced but most welcome especially loyal regular guests.

209,Central and convenient location,"Check-in was prompt, room is spacious, clean and comfortable and services was great. Hotel is central and convenient to many attraction sites, majority of it are within 20 - 25 minutes walk. Taxi and Uber to many attraction sites from the hotel are around 8 - 12 Euro depending on traffic.",4,2016,11,02
209,Time in Dublin,"We were met with an open door with smiles and excellent service and never had to look for help. Danny Maguire and Ivana were two of the names that stand out, but there were many. We had smiles and laughs while discussing sights and restaurants and flight confirmation. Thanks for the great stay at your excellent facility.",5,2016,11,02
209,5 stars isn't enough,"We can't say enough good things about the Conrad and it's staff.  From Nicola's communication and insuring that we had an early check-in. To Ivana's amazing ability to get me into a dentist within 15 minutes after checking in (and saving our vacation by doing so).  Danny and Tony's knowledge, sincere desire to listen and help us achieve everything we wanted to do.  Everyone we encountered was so friendly and willing to help.  Our room was fantastic and couldn't have been more spacious and cozy.  Breakfast was amazing everyday as well.  Great location, easy walk through St. Stephens Green and to all of the shopping, Trinity College and Temple Bar and everything else that you would want to do.  This is the only place we would ever stay in Dublin.",5,2016,11,02
209,Touch of class,"A great, luxurious hotel right in the heart of Dublin. An amazing experience. The hotel was easily accessible and on site parking was brilliant. The reception staff were friendly and helpful and immediately created a rapport. The foyer was spotless as was the room. Espresso machine instead of awful instant coffee in the room and the bed was as comfortable as I've had. Breakfast and breakfast staff were fabulous.If I had any grumble it would be that I never got to experience the complete package the hotel had to offer. It was perfectly situated between RDS and marathon start line. Would love to return for a relaxing break.",5,2016,11,02
209,Great convenient spot in Dublin,"I just spent 3 days on a business trip in Dublin and loved the Conrad there.  Room was very spacious, clean and well appointed.  The breakfast was great with choices of tasty well prepared options.  I was able to enjoy the gym in solitude and found it well equipped and quite comfortable.  I am not super familiar with Dublin but was able to get around easily and found the location very convenient for business area and for walking in the evening.",5,2016,11,01
209,Dublin hotel near Stephen's Gate,This was a great hotel to stay for business nearby at Royal College of Surgeons. Short walking distance to Grafton Street shopping and Trinity College. Also was good location for marathon runners (as marathon started in the vacinity). Was able to walk to expo.,5,2016,10,31
209,Perfect location for Dublin Marathon ,"I stayed the night before the Marathon due to traffic restrictions. It was only a ten minute walk to the start line. The staff from reception, concierge, & Accomadation were very helpful & friendly. 10/10 👍👍👍",5,2016,10,31
209,Great Stay for Dublin Marathon 2016,"We had a great stay as my handsome fiancée completed the full marathon. The staff were very accommodating, friendly and helpful. They've provided a great service and they are simply amazing! Thank you reception, breakfast and accommodation staff.",5,2016,10,31
209,"Good location, great breakfast","Location is good, right across from the concert hall. Staff is decent and warned of the ongoing construction during daytime hours. Breakfast spread for diamond/gold members is great. Did not receive a diamond upgrade during the stay.",4,2016,10,29
209,We had an excellent stay!,Staff were amazing! Couldnt fault the hotel in any way. The hotel looks great and the staff just complement it 100%. On -1 there is a little jem of a craft beer bar! Excellent beer and food! I will be back. Neil and Chris  looked after us all night.,5,2016,10,28
209,Nice hotel in a good location.,"Nice hotel just a half block from
St Stephens Green.  Hotel is nicely appointed and has an awesome breakfast buffet. There are probably hotels closer to all the action (Temple Bar, Grafton Street) but it is really not that far of a walk through the Green to get to all the sights.",5,2016,10,27
209,"Great location, top service, restful nights","This Hilton hotel was recently renovated, luxuriously appointed and priced accordingly. A convenient base for exploring Dublin, close to St Stephens Green but not downtown. We stopped for two nights to lose jet lag prior to a train tour of Ireland. 
Very quiet room, pleasant staff, dining room and bar. A casual bar is found in the lower level. Something for everyone.",4,2016,10,25
209,I love staying here,"The Conrad is my favourite hotel in Dublin.  John at reception was so nice and friendly on arrival. Our room was beautiful, very new, clean and comfortable. The WiFi was great. We had room service in the evening, the food was great. The location of the hotel is perfect, walking distance to Grafton Street. Breakfast was delicious and the staff were so nice. The hotel was in the process of being renovated during our stay - it looks like it will be great.",5,2016,10,24
209,Conrad Hilton Hotel,"Very pleased with the choice Fantastic location ,staff is absolutely outstanding,  it was a great choice for Dublin  extremely please with room comfort and the property is spotless with lots of great restaurant choices in the area",5,2016,10,24
209,"Average hotel, average service","Although I was checking a little earlier than 3pm, I was informed my chosen room wasn't ready but there was an equivalent available immediately. The room was on the first floor (131) and was directly above the reception lobby with no noise exclusion whatsoever. I could have taken minutes for every conversation held in reception for the time I was in the room. Impossibly noisy at night and difficult to sleep as well as very noisy AC units. Average service, in-room dining and concierge take forever to answer the phone. When checking out, 3 staff were busy chatting and I couldn't get their attention to take the express check-out envelope and I have still not received a copy of my invoice - 3 days later.",3,2016,10,24
209,Great service,Enjoyed our stay.  The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. Room accommodations are very clean and comfortable. Really liked the pub downstairs. The staff there were very friendly and service and food were good. Especially the onion rings!,5,2016,10,24
209,OUTSTANDING Service EXCELLENT Location!,"We've stayed at some of the finest hotels and this stay rates right up in the top few!  We had toured all over Ireland so this was our last stay at the end of a long trip.  The location worked out perfectly for what we wanted, to walk the city and get a feel for Dublin.  The staff exceeded our expectations with recommendations and service!  Food was excellent and energy of hotel great!  We would highly recommend!",5,2016,10,24
209,EXCEPTIONAL!,"From accommodating an early morning check-in after a trans-atlantic flight to check-out four days later, the Conrad Dublin staff provided FIVE STAR service every step of my stay. The newly remodeled ""Premier"" rooms offer all the tech upgrades an international traveler could desire, and the on property Coburg Brasserie, as well as Lemuel's Lounge Bar, offer atmosphere along with excellent hearty Irish cuisine using only the freshest Emerald Isle ingredients. If Historic Dublin wasn't a mere city block away, I might have been tempted to never leave this exceptional hotel.",5,2016,10,23
209,Great Staff ....Hotel Not Quite Great Yet,We spent a weekend here. The staff were very attentive and polite. The breakfast was outstanding and dinner very good. Our room was comfortable but it's clear that the fabric of the hotel needs investment  - which it appears is happening.  We would certainly return.,4,2016,10,22
209,Nice! Nice!! Nice!!!,"A really nice albeit short stay.  Staff were friendly, courteous and helpful. Nice sized room with lots of space and with modern amenities, great breakfast buffet, not stale, everything tasted fresh. Nice location too!",5,2016,10,20
209,one night dublin,"Not the most helpful receptionist I requested a newly refurbished room when I booked after reading poor reviews, even though these new rooms were available she wanted to charge us 40 Euros even though we are part of the honours club, she also didn't listen to what I was saying   Room was nice but a little tired. Excellent service from all the other hotel staff",3,2016,10,20
209,Location Location Location,"This was a work trip but I have to say the Conrad is perfectly situated for a leisure trip as well, minutes away from shopping, eating, bars and the canal it really is in the heart of the city. The rooms were spacious and comfortable without being wow and breakfast & dinner were served with care and attention to detail and compliments paid to the chef. The only thing that would stop me staying on my own account was the price, I know the location probably accounted for that, but almost £300 a night is steep for me.

If work send me back I'll aim for the Conrad again but otherwise it is out of my league I fear.",4,2016,10,19
209,A Nice Hotel is a Great Location,"The hotel is rather bland on the outside but we thought our room was nicely furnished and very quiet.  Breakfast was a real highlight with lots of interesting choices.  

We really liked the location.  It was close to everything but was very quiet at night.  I thought the staff was attentive and provided good service.  We were very happy to have chosen it for our 3-night stay.",5,2016,10,18
209,"Hard to see merits of €13,000,000 refurbishment","Stayed in July. Room was dated and noisey. When management were informed they offered us an alternative room but as it was late and we were ready for bed this was impractical. It was clear that staff were aware of issues with plumbing which caused the noise. Why were we put in this room? Why were we not warned? The sky tv service was woeful and picture kept ""freezing"". After complaining I was offered ""our sincerest apologies"".( Karen Laszzalette Executive Secretary 20 July 2016).
An inadequate response to a bona ride complaint from a customer who paid for a 5 star experience.

Attended for a pre theatre meal last Saturday October 15. The refurbishments are complete. The atmospheric bar is no longer. The piano is gone. The temperature was cold and numerous other guests struggled and huddled to get comfortable. When we queried the cold we were informed there was an ongoing problem with the heat.  Spent €59.50 on food and drink. At that price I feel ripped off.
",3,2016,10,17
209,New lounge area cosy but food pathetic,"We often go here for a light meal and a drink. The lounge has been done up which means that there are more tables - this was always a problem in the past. However, the food is bordering on pathetic. It is inexcusable to charge €18 for a small platter of cured meats and some funny oversized crackers. The sandwich taster plate is even worse, €12 for what in total amounts to a single sandwich.  If even the bread or the spread was nice, but no, of the variety that you get in the Spar next door, very sparsely applied. The choice has become very limited, possibly due to some arrangement with the Alfie Byrne outfit in the basement. After 10 years of frequent visits I won't be going back.",3,2016,10,17
209,great location,"I stayed here for two nights for business and for a family occasion. It was a very standard hotel experience, the room was clean and all the facilities were good. The location is excellent. I have stayed before and this time felt a loss of the personal touch and friendliness that I experienced before. It was nothing special.",3,2016,10,17
209,Conrad Dublin,"Excellent hotel in a great location. Service oriented and friendly.  Pub on the lower level is a very place, low key. Professional and friendly staff.  Thought the on-site restaurant, Coburg, could benefit from more attentive service.",5,2016,10,16
209,Great service ,We were going out in the city for my boyfriend's birthday so I booked a room in the Conrad as a treat. I understand the hotel is undergoing renovations but the room we were in was very dated and nothing special for a 5 star hotel. It was clean and the bed was very comfortable but I have stayed in nicer 4 star rooms. The staff were great and sent up a birthday plate when they found out it was my boyfriends birthday. The breakfast was lovely and served until 11 which means you can have a lie in! We had drinks in Alfie Byrnes which is a lively bar serving craft beers. Would recommend calling in for a drink! ,4,2016,10,16
209,Nice hotel in a great location,"Had a lovely couple of days staying here, hotel is right on the shuttle route from Dublin airport and just a short walk through St Stephens park to the town centre. Hotel bar was reasonably priced. Typical capital city five star hotel , clean bright rooms but not spectacular.",4,2016,10,15
209,Great Comfortable Hotel In Centre Of Dublin,"This is a really good value hotel in the centre of Dublin.  Only 5 minutes walk from St Stephens Green and 10 minutes from main attractions in the centre of Dublin.
The hotel is typical ""Conrad"" being a level down from Hilton. Our room had an enormous king bed and a well set out bathroom (shower over bath).
Breakfast was very good and we included it in the package.
Breakfast staff need to better manage service as we encountered a few service failures possibly as a result of seemingly several servers looking after the same tables.
My main concern is always the bed and in the case of the Conrad it was not fantastic but large and fairly firm without too many dips.
I would recommend staying at the Conrad if looking for a 4 star functional, comfortable hotel in the centre of Dublin.",4,2016,10,13
209,Great Dublin Location,"The hotel is conveniently located across from St. Stephen's Green near Trinity College.  It is easy to get around and walking distance to good shopping, dining and pubs. The staff takes their job seriously and I was always greeted with a friendly hello by everyone I encountered.  It has a decent fitness center, a nice breakfast and good bar area.  The rooms are nice and roomy for a European center hotel.  The concierge gave good restaurant recommendations as well.",5,2016,10,11
209,Topnotch!,"This is an outstanding hotel. Its perfectly located on the quieter side of St Stephens Green, a short walk from bustling Grafton street. 
The hotel is lovely. Large rooms in muted colours. Big bathroom. The breakfast was perhaps the best we have ever had in hotel stays across continents. The quality of the ingredients was evident.
Highly recommended!",5,2016,10,11
209,Conrad Hilton - Dublin,"A superb hotel.  Great decor, rooms and facilities.  Food is also very good.  Staff though are really impressive.  Extremely helpful, courteous and great humour (especially in the bar).  Will definitely stay again next time in Dublin.",5,2016,10,11
209,Concert Trip,"My wife and I took the opportunity to spend the night in Dublin following attending a concert at the nearby National Concert Hall.
The experience at the Conrad was overall extremely good, though a small issue was the incredibly hard mattress in the room. I don't recall ever sleeping in such a hard bed before; definitely spoilt a good nights sleep.
The only other comment was the rather expensive cost of drinks in the lobby bar.",5,2016,10,09
209,Quality of this hotel experience made our Dublin visit extra special.,"This hotel is spotlessly clean, in an excellent location just a short walk from St. Steven's Green. It has convenient on site parking, an amazing and helpful staff, with a great on site pub. This hotel is a wise choice. ",5,2016,10,09
209,"I wan't to give this hotel a five, but I can't...","I booked Conrad Dublin believing they were done with the refurbishment (From the website: ""Our designers are already working their magic on transforming our rooms. Book your stay now and discover for yourselves from spring 2016""). However, I was disappointed to walk into an old, worn out room, that felt dirty-ish.

The furnitures had huge scrapings, things was falling off the interior, even the keycard reader was up for retirement. The bathroom felt very dirty, and things were falling off (i.e the toilet seat halfway off). The room was big (Dublin-wise), and the beds were ok.

We only had two days in Dublin and didn't spend much time in the room, but when I checked out I mentioned the state of the room and the lacking of a five-star experience. The answer I got? ""You should have requested one of our refurbished rooms!"" Seriously, if you call yourself a five-star Conrad hotel, and have the possibility to offer that experience, why offer a one-star motel experience?

Other than that little (irony) detail, I think the staff was amazing. The breakfast offered a huge selection, felt fresh and was very well organized and presented.

Alfie Byrne's - a craft beer bar in the basement, genius!",3,2016,10,09
209,Conrad is the only Hilton option in Western Europei,"I've been sorely disappointed with Hiltons in W Europe in the past but not with this fantastic hotel.  Great service, smart, classy and updated rooms and what has to be the best hotel breakfast I've ever had with high quality, local foods.  A true 5 star experience all around.  ",5,2016,10,09
209,Disappointment with Conrad,"I recently stayed one night at Conrad Hotel in anticipation of comfort and nice service, However, I was disappointed for the following reasons: there was a hammering noise from unknown source in the hotel from at least midnight until check-out next morning, slowest internet connection I have ever seen in any hotel, where I have stayed during the last 7-8 years and, you would not believe me- flies lingering around breakfast buffet table.",2,2016,10,08
209,One last night in Ireland - ended on a high ,Used point for two wonderful rooms.   We ate dinner at the hotel restaurant which was unbelievably good.   We toured around Dublin and ended up with a wonderful breakfast before leaving for the airport.   The hotel staff did everything but Tuck us in at night and feed us.  However they would've if we would've asked.,5,2016,10,08
209,Luxurious and cosy,"Very luxurious and comfortable stay. I liked the staff and the hotel and the amenities.   Expensive though, the hotel is near the center. We walked to the center and it was very pleasant to be around the city. The dining is good, expensive. The breakfast is very sophisticated.",4,2016,10,07
209,A very good choice,"Incredible hotel, modern rooms and facilities, very clean, it shows that they take care of every detail. Excellent location, just a few minutes walk from the center of Dublin. Breakfast is tipi buffet and à la carte. Good deal. Highly recommended.",4,2023,09,16
209,Das Hotel „liefert“ was man erwartet,"Eingangs sollte erwähnt werden, dass ich bei der Buchung einer Unterkunft in Dublin erstaunt war, wie die Preisstruktur aussieht.
Dies hat in Kombination eines sehr guten Angebotes des Conrad für die Buchung von 3 Nächten geführt. 
Der Empfang war hoch professionell und hat den Erwartungen an ein Hotel dieser Klasse komplett erfüllt. 
Das Zimmer im 6ten Stock war geräumig und gepflegt. Hinsichtlich der Sauberkeit und auch im Hinblick auf den täglichen Zimmerservice waren wir absolut zufrieden. 
Es ist empfehlenswert, das Frühstück mitzubuchen, da neben dem Buffet, auch a la Carte Speisen beinhaltet sind. 
Dann hat man auch ein sehr schönes Speiseangebot. 
Den Fitness und Wellnessbereich haben wir nicht besucht. 
Auch wenn die Lage leicht abseits des Zentrums ist, kann die Innenstadt mit den Sehenswürdigkeiten zu Fuß ohne Probleme erkundet werden. 
Die Anbindung an das Busnetz ist recht gut, so dass man auch mit dem Aircoach für 9 EUR ohne Probleme anfahren kann. 
Für einen verregneten Nachmittag ist der Afternoon Tea zu empfehlen. 
Ich werde das Hotel bei einem ähnlichen Preis (den ich angemessen finde) wieder buchen und empfehle es gerne weiter,",5,2022,10,23
209,Esperienza sublime,"La struttura è perfetta ma quello che fa la differenza è lo staff .
Dalla colazione dove sei accolto con un sorriso raggiante fino al check out.
Personale professionale ma non troppo rigido ed impostato , famigliare ma di lusso.
È stato bellissimo soggiornare qui .
Unica nota negativa era la cassaforte che non funzionava correttamente in camera (707) ma non utilizzandola non l’ho fatto presente.",5,2022,10,08

Aunque no está justo en el centro turístico de la ciudad, se encuentra a 10 minutos andando, y es un agradable paseo a través de un parque.

Habitaciones espaciosas, cómodas y funcionales. La cama es muy cómoda.

Buen restaurante y pub. También me gustó el desayuno.

Por decir algo, sugiero que cambien las ventanas de las habitaciones. Entra algo de frío y ruido y abrirlas/cerrarlas es complicado y es fácil hacerse daño.",4,2019,11,23
209,Servicio y detalles a mejorar,"Mi pareja y yo acabamos de pasar dos días en este hotel. La ubicación es perfecta, cerca del centro y muy bien comunicado con el bus desde el aeropuerto. El hotel es muy bonito y más aun con las decoraciones de Navidad. Sin embargo para ser un Conrad que es un servicio 5 estrella en el que se cuidan mucho lo detalles, el de Dublín deja mucho que desear. El check in fue bastante rápido, no hizo mención a nuestro HHonors y no informó sobre dinde esta el desayuno y demás horarios... El pub es ideal con un toque desenfadado y una carta bastante variada. Sin embargo y aunque el staff fue amable, se equivocaron de plato en primer día. Lo rectificaron y trajeron el correcto 15 minutos después. Al dia siguiente volvimos a cenar a las 8pm. Al terminar nuestro plato quisimos pedir un postre pero los camareros tardaron 20 minutos en darse cuenta de que habíamos terminado y al pedir el postre (9:06) dijeron que la cocina ya había cerrado. Genial. 
En cuanto a la habitación, tiene todas las comodidades. El desayuno no está a la altura de un hotel semejante. La mayor de platos a la carta tienen suplemento y el buffet es ridículamente escaso. El staff del desayuno es poco atento y otra vez, se olvidaron de las comandas por tanto tenemos que volver a pedirlas y tardan en llegar. A modo de crítica constructiva.

209,Zentral gelegenes Hotel mit gutem Service ,"Der Service war bei Ankunft und Abreise stets zuvorkommend und sehr freundlich. Nach Bezug des Zimmers fiel auf, dass der Föhn nicht funktionierte. In fünf Minuten konnte für Ersatz gesorgt werden. Da es für Hilton Honors kein extra Restaurantbereich gab wurde für Ersatz per kleiner Beigabe an Süßem gesorgt. Der Zimmerservice war stets aufmerksam. Die Betten bzw. Matratzen waren sehr gemütlich. Das Zimmer war zu einer Seitenstraße und sehr ruhig. Das Frühstück war reichhaltig, frisch zubereitet nach Wunsch und stellt jeden Geschmack zufrieden. Die Lage des Hotels befindet sich sehr zentral. Restaurants als auch der St. Stephens Green befindet sich in unmittelbarer Nähe. Die Buchung wurde für ein Wochenende gebucht als auch einem beruflichen Termin gebucht. Auf Wunsch kann Bügeleisen und alles weitere aufs Zimmer bereit gestellt werden. Rundum für Businesskunden als auch Wochenendtrips in Dublin super geeignet! Danke, für den tollen und angenehmen Aufenthalt! ",4,2017,09,27
209,Quasi perfetto,"Hotel centrale, in zona tranquilla.
Reception, rapida e chiara nelle spiegazioni.
Camera, molto ampia e ben equilibrata nei colori e negli arredi.
Bagno grande e funzionale, ben illuminato, e fornito.
Colazione, completa nel buffet e con le ordinazioni a là carte, comprese nel prezzo.

Negativo: stanza dei figli, con il Water sporco dalla visita precedente, alle 08,00 am, una cameriera è entrata in stanza senza bussare, svegliando i ragazzi.

209,Einfach unverschämt,"Wir haben das Hotel für ein Sightseeing Wochenende in Dublin gebucht und waren auch für unser Hotel voller Vorfreude. Leider wurden unsere (hohen) Erwartungen im Conrad Dublin sehr enttäuscht.
Check In: Bereits beim Check In wurde wir kaum eines Blickes gewürdigt. Die Konversation beim Check In beschränkte sich darauf, ob wir Mitglied im Hilton Honors Programm sind und das man unsere Kreditkarte braucht. Ein herzlicher Empfang sieht anderes aus. 
Dann das Zimmer: Es enthält alles was man so braucht, aber auch nicht mehr und nicht weniger als man es von Vier Sterne Hotels kennt. Die Fenster waren sehr schlecht isoliert, nur gut, dass wir in unserem Fünf Sterne Hotel Ohropax dabei hatten. 
Dann das Frühstück: Das Hotel ist von der Raumkapazität als auch vom Service nicht in der Lage ein anständiges Frühstück zu servieren. Am ersten Tag fragte man uns, ob wir in der Bar frühstücken wollen. Das verneinten wir, da wir einen normalen Tisch wollten und nicht in Dunkelatmosphäre essen wollten. Das Problem des normalen (Frühstück-)Restaurants war, dass der Service schlichtweg überfordert war. Drei Personen standen rum, statt mal die Teller von den mittlerweile leeren Tischen wegzuräumen. Kein Wunder, dass man uns dann zunächst nur die Bar als Platz anbieten kann. Wir haben uns dann selbst Platz geschaffen. Die Butter wird direkt an den Platz serviert und ist nicht am Buffet erhältlich. Eine nette Idee, wenn der Service funktioniert. Wir bekamen trotz dreimaliger Nachfrage aber nie Butter. Auch sonst ließ die Frühtücksauswahl zu wünschen übrig. Ich habe in Drei Sterne Hotels oder in jedem Motel One schon besseres Frühstück eingenommen.
Zur Lage: Von allen relevanten Sehenswürdigkeiten mindestens 30 Minuten zu Fuß entfernt. Eine Anbindung mit dem öffentlichen Nahverkehr zu den Sehenswürdigkeiten ist nicht gegeben (bzw. es dauert genau so lange wie zu Fuß). Es gibt in Dublin Hotels in deutlich besserer Lage. 
Der Check Out: Der Gipfel der Unfreundlichkeit. Wieder keines Blickes gewürdigt und nicht mal gefragt, ob man uns ein Taxi rufen darf oder unser Gepäck verstauen kann, etc. Wie es uns gefallen hat, interessierte natürlich auch niemanden.
Fazit: Für 700 Euro für zwei Nächte findet man sicher bessere und vor allem höflichere Unterkünfte, auch im tendenziell teuren Dublin.",1,2017,06,19
209,Soggiorno stupendo,"Ho soggiornato per tre notti in questo splendido hotel. Ottima la location, staff disponibile e attento, sia alla reception che al ristorante. L'hotel si trova nel cuore di Dublino a due passi dal parco e dal centro.
Suite molto bella, dotata di ogni comfort, colazione squisita con prodotti di ottima qualità. Lo consiglio a tutti e spero di tornarci presto!",5,2017,06,11
209,Stilvoll und zentral!,"Das Hotel liegt zentral und zeigt sich sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Das Zimmer ist in der Größe sehr gut angelegt und lässt für einen Aufenthalt keine Wünsche offen. Das Personal ist sehr nett und das Frühstück ist ausgezeichnet.

Lediglich das Zimmer 137 sollte man überdenken, durch die exponierte Lage hört man die Lobby teilweise sehr stark. Auch sollten die Fenster neu isoliert werden um 100% Genuss zu gewährleisten. Das Pub unter dem Fenster sorgte für laute Stimmung.

209,Zentral gelegen,"Unser Zimmer war leider durch einen technischen Defekt noch nicht fertig als wir angekommen sind. Die City ist fussläufig in 5 min. erreichbar. Als Hilton Honors Mitglied haben wir ein Upgrade in die Junior Suite bekommen. Diese hatte einen großen Schreibtisch, eine Couch mit Tisch zum essen. Alles sehr geräumig im klassischen Hilton Style aber mit modernen Akzenten. Leider war die Dusche eine Zumutung! Ich bin schon relativ schmal aber selbst ich konnte mich in dieser nicht nach rechts oder links drehen. Keine gute Lösung!
Das Frühstück war perfekt, eins der besten.
Wenn Dublin dann auch gerne wieder das Conrad",5,2017,02,13
209,"zentrale Lage, Zimmer okay.","Das Hotel befindet sich sehr zentral, ein kurzer Weg und man ist in einem der zahlreichen Parkanlagen Dublins (St. Stepehens Green), sowie direkt in der Einkaufsmeile (St. Stephens Shopping Centre). Das Zimmer war okay, europäische Steckdosen vorhanden. Die Fenster sind allerdings etwas älter und nicht ganz dicht. Ansonsten sauber und ordentlich.",4,2017,01,18
209,Una estancia agradable,"Un hotel correcto, la situación excelente, tanto por la cercanía al centro como la tranquilidad de estar un poco apartado de la zona comercial. El desayuno está muy bien, sin embargo la wifi no es gratis en las habitaciones, teniendo en cuenta el precio. El autobus que lleva al aeropuerto ""airlink 757"" te lleva de puerta a puerta y se ahorra unos 60€ de taxi.",4,2017,01,05
209,Die renovierten Zimmer sind traumhaft,"Für unseren Städtetrip nach Dublin haben wir das Conrad ausgesucht. Das Hotel ist in der Nähe des Stadtzentrums, sehr ruhig bei einem Park gelegen. Das Einkaufsviertel ist in wenigen Minuten zu Fuss erreichbar.
Die Inneneinrichtung ist sehr geschmacksvoll und luxuriös. Ich habe mich auf anhieb wohl gefühlt. Das Einchecken war in wenigen Sekunden erledigt. Als Diamond Member bekamen wir ein frisch renoviertes Zimmer. Dieses Zimmer wird auch höchsten Ansprüchen gerecht an Geschmack und Ausstattung.
Das Frühstück welches wir im Hotel geniessen durften gehört in Bezug auf Auswahl, Regionalität, Qualität und Präsentation zum Besten was ich bisher gesehen habe.
Ich war zu 100% zufrieden mit dem Conrad und kann es wärmstens weiterempfehlen.",5,2017,01,02
209,Excelente Experiencia,"La habitacion es un lujo, la calidad de los detalles es sorprendente.
En recepcion me gustó mucho la atencion del conserje Irlandes, porque es bueno tener recomendaciones de alguien local para variar.  La ubicacion es ideal, a pocos metros del canal y del parque  y el distrito comercial.",5,2016,12,20
209,Pratico ed elegante! ,"Immerso nel centro di Dublino, ma leggermente fuori dalla ""baraonda"", questo hotel è di classe e assolutamente pratico (vicinissimo alla partenza della maratona di Dublino). Camere pulite, spaziose e silenziose. Colazione varia ed internazionale.",4,2016,11,22
209,"Hotel clasico, quiza algo pasado de moda pero muy confortable y muy bien situado","Conrad en Dublin, quiza este acusando el apso del tiempo pero no obstante es un hotel de lujo, muy confortable y totalmente recommendable. A mi me gusta especialmente la cama enorme y comodisima, las almohadas mullidas. El desayuno es perfecto un despliegue de bocados apetecibles presentados con mucho gusto.",4,2016,11,15
