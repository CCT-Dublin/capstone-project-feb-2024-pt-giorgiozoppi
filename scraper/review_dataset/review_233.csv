233,Dublin Can Be Heaven,"Dublin can definitely be heaven and walking into town at 5pm on Friday, just as people were getting off work and walking into town too, I was reminded of that. It's such a beautiful walk from Lansdowne Road into town and the road brings you to some of my favourite places in the city centre, Merrion Square, Nassau Street, Trinity College. Ariel House is an ideal place to stay in Dublin. To leave there in the morning, after a sumptuous breakfast, in a light-filled dining room, and return there for coffee or tea and cake in the drawing room, with time for a good browse of the Irish Times (generously provided by Ariel House), gives a sense of having a luxurious home from home. I think the ideal thing would be to have a midweek break in Ariel House, staying two or three nights, to enjoy the house, the area (Ballsbridge) and the people, both staff and guests, with whom there is plenty of opportunity to chat. From the staff: unstinting kindness, consideration, warmth, and friendliness. I'd like to see Ariel House in every season.  Kudos to all! You do a great job! Thank you!  And oh yes, the bedroom was perfect too! ",5,2024,10,13
233,Wonderful  Place To Stay In Dublin,"My daughter and I walked inside and immediately relaxed due to the beautiful entry, parlor, and welcoming staff.  The front desk person, Shareef, is beyond excellent.  Our flight arrived early and we walked in unannounced early.  He made me a tea and helped us put our luggage in a safe place until our room would be ready.  We got an estimated time when we could move our luggage and we left to sightsee.  Before we left, I let Shareef know we would not have breakfast the next morning because we had an early appointment.  He made sure each of us had a continental breakfast ready at the front desk to take with us.  Upon our return, we seamlessly moved into our room and had a wonderful night's sleep.  We were very grateful to Shareef and the kitchen staff the next morning to have food and we enjoyed our take-away breakfast.  When we saw him the next day, we worked with him on some local sites to see and he was very helpful.  It was so nice to work with professional employees such as Shareef and the cleaning staff.  We had the best time and very much appreciated coming back and relaxing in the parlor and our pretty room.  The cake is as delicious as previous reviewers noted. The full breakfast was delicious and hearty.  Ariel house was quiet, our beds were comfortable, and our bath and showers were wonderful.  The location is not as central if you are looking to have active nightlife just outside the door.  We loved the change of pace and appreciated being in a more relaxed neighborhood.  There are restaurants and bars nearby, but the selection is smaller than being more central.  The Dart is a stone's throw away which made using it very convenient.  Aviva Stadium is walking distance for those attending an event there.  We used the Dart daily, walked quite a bit, and if very tired while being a few miles away later in the night, we took an Uber.  All transportation options were easy and convenient for us.  We plan to return and stay here again.",5,2024,10,06
233,Well appointed spacious clean rooms.,Loved the location - away from the bustle of Dublin but close enough to get around. The rooms were spacious and clean.Enjoyed  the lounge area and being able to make a cup of tea or have a drink and relax with friends. The breakfast was great with plenty to eat.,5,2024,10,05
233,I will come back,Everything was very good. The breakfast was very tasty and varied. The hotel staff was very attentive and courteous. The rooms were large enough. Minor structural defects due to the age of the hotel - but nothing major. Room service did a good job. The railway station is within walking distance,5,2024,10,03

233,Wonderful Work Trip,"From the very beginning, the attention to detail was excellent. My room was beautiful, so quiet and a lovely temperature. Breakfast was very tasty and Debora looked after me so well each morning of my 3 day stay. The drawing room and honesty bar were a lovely touch. It is in a fantastic location close to the Aviva, RDS and the dart station. I will definitely be back for another visit.",5,2024,09,29

233,Great hotel walking distance to downtown,"Great service from minute we walked into hotel.  Staff were very friendly and attentive.  Room was clean and beds comfortable.  The breakfast was unbelievable with lots of choices. The hardy breakfast was enough to hold you all day long. It was a 20 minute walk to the closest Hop On Off stop, 2 min walk to the DART and a 20 minute walk to downtown.  There were a number of great restaurants within a 10 minute walk.  Really a great location for exploring Dublin.",5,2024,09,22
233,Excellent Hotel in Dublin,Thank you for the excellent service of Debora and her colleagues. Great hotel with excellent breakfast.,5,2024,09,19
233,Not Properly Part of iNua!! Don’t get caught Out!,"I got a voucher for the iNua collection for my birthday and decided to stay at the Ariel House. There were supposed to be two of us but the other person got sick so I went on my own. When I arrived I informed them that I’d be partially paying with the €150 iNua voucher I had but he said that didn’t work in their particular hotel and it say’s so on the website. However you would have to go right through to the very bottom of a long list of terms and conditions to see this. 
I ended up having to pay an extortionate amount of money for the night as it was too late to cancel. He gave me €10 off because he felt sorry for me. However it wasn’t good enough what’s the point of being part of a small collection of hotels? It’s absolutely ridiculous. 

Furthermore the hotel was fine, I didn’t think it was worth €250 for one night B&B. Poor Gluten Free choices of breakfast. The bed was comfortable and it was quiet and the living room area was nice however with the whole voucher disaster it just left a sour taste. Also I thought it was a nice touch they had left some snacks like little chocolate bars and lemonade - turned out you had to pay for them too but no price menu left in the room so you’d never know until you get caught out! 

I contacted the iNua collection on website but I didn’t even get an acknowledgment of a reply. 

Overall - there’s far better hotels for that price range, I would stay clear and be careful with iNua vouchers.",3,2024,09,19
233,A Gem of a Boutique Hotel,"From first arrival to departure 5 days later, we were treated very well by the front desk staff and indeed by all the staff. The front desk personnel were helpful with directions and recommendations. We were especially pleased with the breakfasts served in a light filled room. You can start with a continental buffet of yogurt, fresh fruit salad, a variety of breads, small buns, croissants and cheese slices and granola. Then you can order a starter and a hot main from the menu, and the servers are happy to bring coffees of choice or tea. We found all the servers welcoming and pleasant, especially Debora who greeted us each morning.

Another delightful feature is the lounge, which was likely the front parlour of the original house. It’s a large room with comfortable seating and a good Nespresso coffee machine that also dispenses hot water for tea. The front desk staff bring out biscuits/cookies/little cakes throughout the day. Guests may just help themselves to these complimentary items. Also on offer in the lounge are wines and whiskey for you to help yourself and simply advise the front desk of your consumption so that the cost can be added to your bill.

Ariel House is located within minutes’ walk to the commuter train station where the DART train takes you to the centre of the city in about ten minutes. Good pubs and other eateries can be found in the neighbourhood. A wonderful location!",5,2024,09,18

233,"Nice breakfast, nice hotel, will be returning","The breakfast was fabulous, the drawing room lovely, and the guest room quiet and comfortable. All the staff were friendly and professional. Ariel House is exactly how I imagined countryside style from TV series. The location is great, just a 5-10 minute walk to the nearest Tesco or other supermarkets, and 30-40 minutes to the tourist sites. I was lucky with the weather during my stay in Dublin, and a 30-40 minute walk back to the hotel each day was perfect.  The breakfast was amazing, especially the Irish soda brown bread (I'm not sure about its name sorry...) with jam, and the granola bowl. I also received little gifts for choosing the “clean the planet, not my room” option—macarons, cookies, and a small pack of granola, which is one of my favorite memories from Dublin.",5,2024,09,10
233,Every aspect of my stay was first- class!,"I really enjoyed my stay in Ariel House ,  which I thought was very elegant and well run.

The Inn is both gorgeous and very comfortable and the staff are all very professional and welcoming. We loved coming back to the drawing room after a busy day to enjoy the homemade afternoon treats and a drink. Breakfast was absolutely delicious and was served in a beautiful setting. We also loved the location with the DART station just down the street. We could not have been any happier with our stay at Ariel House. It was exactly as we hoped it would be!,5,2024,09,02

233,Home From Home,"I stayed here for the second year in a row during Dublin Horse Show week. Ariel House is perfectly located for the RDS and all the many bars/restaurants in the area - just a short walk really.
Beautifully furnished, clean and comfortable rooms, the staff are very welcoming and friendly. I love the big drawing room where you can help yourself to tea, coffee and freshly baked goodies all day, all complimentary.

233,"If I could give zero stars I would give zero stars. Absolutely livid, received a phone call after making a booking for next year","If I could give zero stars I would give zero stars. Absolutely livid, received a phone call after making a booking for next year a few hours later saying they have to cancel my booking. I got a confirmation emailed immediately after booking and was delighted to have got a room. Bit pricey but was for one night only. The excuse I got was ""oh the system crashed"". No it didn't as the website was working perfectly and no traffic at all going to it at booking as it was early. I spoke to a man and I could already tell he had a smirk on his face, over the phone. And I also said, it's a disgrace and you can't cancel it. I also stated over the phone I was expecting this phone call. They cancelled my room for 280 so they add on about another 5 or 6 hundred to the room for the same night and the are money hungry. Never again will I book here. It's a disgrace and you should be ashamed of your lives for doing this to genuine people.",1,2024,08,28

233,A Victorian Room with a View,"My daughter and I adored our stay at Ariel house. We had a garden room in the Mews and it was comfy, well appointed, clean, very quiet and had a lovely view. The staff was welcoming and knowledgeable. We loved the breakfast!  Their location is ideal for walking to historic downtown sights and shopping or hopping on the well-run train system to see the city or go down the coast. The early check-in option was a wonderful choice… one we much appreciated after taking a red-eye flight from the states. (They also let you leave your luggage with them on first and last days, if needed.) Highly recommend by us both!",5,2024,08,25
233,Absolutely wonderful small hotel.,"This hotel was perfect from start to finish.  We stayed for just one night to go the Royal Dublin Show.   I am so please do I chose Ariel House.   The room was delightful, the staff were all helpful and cheerful and the breakfast was perfect.   The only downside is that we couldn’t stay longer but will definitely be back.  Thankyou to the wonderful team at Ariel House.",5,2024,08,15
233,A brilliant find which made our Dublin stay even more enjoyable.,"What a brilliant find. We chose this hotel on the basis of proximity to a train station so that we could get into Dublin centre and car parking. We got those and so much more.
From the moment we arrived we were treated exceptionally by the person on reception who could not have been more helpful. The room was delightful, the lounge which provided free quality, tea, home made lemonade, mint water and home made cakes throughout the day was a great bonus. Breakfasts were a delight served in the dining room/conservatory. Giuilana was very attentive, efficient and pleasant throughout breakfasts getting us whatever we needed.
The railway station is two minutes walk from the hotel, and the train took us 3 stops down the line into central Dublin, a matter of 10 minutes.
We found some local restaurants in Ballsbridge, in the evenings which offered a nice alternative from what was on offer in Dublin centre and at a much more reasonable price.
We would very much like to return to this hotel the next time we are in Dublin.",5,2024,08,14
233,"Unforgettable, great experience","the stay at ariel House was unforgettable. everything perfect, refined and abundant breakfast, the kindness and professionalism of Debora and all the other staff including the receptionists. available for every request, very quiet, very clean and comfortable room.

233,"Excellent place to stay, I regret not staying longer and cannot wait to return!","I cannot say enough good things about this hotel! We booked the family room, it was enormous. I absolutely loved it, as did my two children.

The whole place is so lovely with amazing attention to detail. The breakfast in the morning was incredible delicious and I wished I could have tried everything. 

Our room was quiet and clean, and spacious. We had plenty of pillows and the bed was comfortable. The whole place was charming with old character and the staff was incredibly friendly.

They let us store bags when we arrived early so we did the hop on hop off bus until check in. The stop was only a 15-20 min walk from the place. 

I loved the old doors and windows but was a bit nervous I was making too much noise opening and closing them. They worked perfectly, but old doors can be heavy I was worried it sounded like I had slammed it a few times.

My kids LOVED the tea time and especially the lemonade, it was so good. During breakfast the servers were so kind to my kids. 

I regret not staying longer! When we’re back in Dublin this is the only place I want to stay.",5,2024,08,08

233,Nice B&B,"Very nice B&B almost Hotel. We had a spacious room on the first floor. We were with 3 people. Very nice breakfest where you could choose from a menu, and there were also things from the buffet. Staff very friendly. All in all good!
Some restaurants near by, within 10-15min walk either directions.",4,2024,08,02
233,Very Nice Stay,"Beautiful Victorian B&B. Very very small parking lot and no reserved space. Love the honesty bar. NO A/C in B&B!!! I understand this is still a bit common but if you run hot blooded and it is warmer than 18°C/65°F outside, your room is going to be very warm, even with the window open. For 3 people, our room was a bit small, hard to move around beds (double, single) and really no where to put suitcases but on table. No fridge and small bathroom. But compared to many other B&B, very nice overall. Would stay again if defiantly cooler weather. Breakfast was VERY good. Not just the normal Irish breakfast but could order from a menu. Only complaint is the dining room can not accommodate all occupants, so if you get there 15 mins later than they ""open"" you will have to wait/come back.",4,2024,07,31
233,A true Gem!,"Stayed overnight last Thursday with my daughter who was home from Australia. I had to change the date of our overnight at late notice but Engin the lovely Customer Services Manager obliged with the minimum of fuss & maximum efficiency. This boutique hotel never fails to deliver a truly wonderful stay. We arrived early but were warmly welcomed by Keila & shown to our room. Our room was spotlessly clean with very comfortable beds. The bathrooms are slightly on your small side but in keeping with an old Victorian building. In the beautiful front lounge, we partook of the complimentary coffee/cake & scrummy shortbread biscuits available to all residents. Breakfast the following morning was absolutely delicious served by such lovely helpful young staff. This hotel is a true gem on the Dublin hotel scene. I will continue to come back confident that it will deliver on every occasion.",5,2024,07,26
233,Quiet stay near Aviva stadium,"Very comfortable lodgings in a lovely quiet neighbourhood. A quick train ride to central Dublin ( or a 25-30 min walk) Great full breakfast available in a beautiful dining room. 10-15 min walk to many local restaurants. Complimentary coffee, tea and cake in a comfortable and peaceful drawing was an extra bonus. Would stay again.",5,2024,07,22
233,Recommend Ariel House,"Quietly situated, close to railway station to go to town centre,  even a 30/35 minute walk will taken you to the main sites.
High standard accomodation (that comes at a price)",4,2024,07,20

A beautiful drawing room provided coffee, tea, and delicious cakes daily. The included breakfast was delicious and the staff were wonderful. Would highly recommend!!",5,2024,07,16
233,PERFECT LOCATION and GREAT SERVICE!,"FANTASTIC!!! Customer service was on point, the B&B was adorable, there was a sitting area with an honor bar, the rooms were small but cozy and very quiet. We chose this site because we were going to the Taylor Swift concert at Aviva Stadium. We literally were able to walk to OUR SEATS within 15 minutes. Getting back to the hotel was a breeze as we watched 100s of 1000s of concert goes begin to make their way home. Parking was included and so was the DELICIOUS breakfast each morning. HIGHLY RECOMMEND to stay if you are going to the stadium, but it was very close to Grafton Street and Temple Bar - a must for travelers! Enjoy!",5,2024,07,11
233,Lovely stay in residential area,"We are very happy with our choice to stay at Ariel house. The residential neighborhood was a big plus for us. So peaceful. An easy 30 min walk to Trinity college which allows you to see more of Dublin and be away from touristy area. Also great public transportation right nearby - train or bus - to save the walk. 
Breakfast was lovely in sun room. Staff helpful. Tea in the lovely living room a bonus. 
The bathroom was small and basic but clean. Room initially quite hot but staff gave us a fan and helped us turn off the heat and we slept well!",4,2024,07,11
233,Perfect Hotel with exceptional staff & service,"I just spent a fantastic few days in Ariel House. Location is perfect, rooms are spotless and lovely friendly staff that went above and beyond to help on every request. Breakfast was delicious. I would highly recommend this hotel visiting Dublin and I can't wait to return.",5,2024,07,09
233,Unfriendly,"Ariel House's historic townhouses are lovely. The location is wonderful- a sweet neighborhood so convenient to everything.  But the issue that sours everything is the staff that seems so completely unconcerned with and distrustful of anything Irish, and additionally, are suspicious and snarky to visitors. And alas if you are a tourist that has an interest in Ireland or surrounding Dublin.

Here is an example; the woman at the front desk would not unlock the front door unless you rang the bell, even if you made eye contact with her or waved to her through the glass front door.  She would greet you with an annoyed “what?” if you approached the front desk. 

I am not the only one who noticed. I had a few giggles about it with other people staying at the Ariel House who definitely noticed all the same things. One guest admitted she was too afraid to report there was no hot water to her shower. 

I am from the USA and I would be equally disappointed if I went to another part of the world, stayed in a historic, local hotel only to find it was staffed by angry New Yorkers who felt superior to the local culture and tourists.

We had a very alarming experience of a male staff member unlocking our door and striding into our room while we were sleeping. He said he was there to arrange for housekeeping. I arranged for housekeeping to return later in the afternoon but over our three night stay, no one ever came to clean. That is ok, we've all been through these kinds of things during Covid times. Still, it was annoying to have to track down your own toilet paper and dry towels, and always wonder if someone is coming or not. Would we enter to find a clean room after a long day walking in the city? No. Even after hanging the “Please Tidy Me” sign on the door.

We stayed at many hotels in Ireland and this is the only one that would not check us in until they had examined everyone's passport and travel documents. To be clear, it is normal for an adult to show some form of ID and credit card when checking in. But in this case we had to retrieve everyone’s documents, including my child's passport from a suitcase in the back of the rental car, parked out on the street. Why? And why treat the visitors at the hotel with such scorn and suspicion?

The Irish continue to be known for their warmth, kindness and welcome. You won't experience much of Ireland at Ariel House.",1,2024,07,09
233,"Epic breakfast, fantastic staff and close to public transport","Ariel House was a fabulous place to stay in Dublin! The staff bent over backwards to help, the rooms were clean, beds comfy and the breakfasts were epic (cereal, fruit, eggs, bacon, cheese, breads & pastries). A coffee machine and cakes are provided in the downstairs lounge for guests. There is limited off-street parking out the front, but public transport is very easy to access (train 2 mins walk, bus about 5 mins). We enjoyed everything about this accommodation and would definitely stay here again!",5,2024,07,08
233,A comfortable and convenient place to stay,Very comfortable house. Good location and helpful front desk.    The room service staff need to be a little more thorough.  (The used mugs need to be replaced daily/complimentary tray refilled daily/a spare toilet roll left!!!!!)   Am sure this can be easily rectified - then a perfect stay/location/comfort.,4,2024,07,08

233,Showing signs of aging and disrepair.,"The exterior and common areas were very charming.  Breakfast was quite good.  Service was not great but alright.  However the rooms, while spacious, are in need of maintenance, as you can see in the included photos.  We stayed for three nights.  The first morning we got up, we discovered that the bath shower had no hot water.  They sent someone up, determined that the shower valve was broken, let us into a different room to shower and promised it would be repaired by the time we return from touring the city.  Next morning, the same problem.  They sent someone else up, who proceeded to explain to me how the shower valve worked.  Of course she could not get it to work either.  Someone else came and explained that the plumber did not have the part and so it was not fixed the day before.  As we were to catch an early plane the next day, rather than chancing it, we moved to another smaller room for the night but was never offered a refund for the price difference or the inconvenience.  

This could be a nice place to stay, but was in need of some love and maintenance care.",2,2024,06,23
233,Comfortable stay,"Upon first seeing the outside of Ariel house and going up to our room, I was impressed by the ambience and the decor. The room itself was nice and the beds were beautiful, and we had a comfortable stay. 
A couple of minor things—The drapes were falling off at a couple of points, which didn’t really impact our stay negatively, but it just looked bad. The floors were sunken in and very creaky at certain parts. The shower was old, the bottom off the bathtub had reddish brown stains that I couldn’t not clean off, and the shower head had blackish red bits that made the shower feel dirty.
Overall, still had a good stay, but I feel that the place needs some updating.",4,2024,06,22
233,Convenient location,"Ideal place to stay if going to an event in Aviva Stadium. Literally 1 minute walk. 
No bar or restaurant but they have the ‘drawing room’ which has an honesty bar with tea/coffee, cakes and wines/whiskey. 
The dart is a minute walk
Room was ok, toilet had flushing issues and there wasn’t great soundproofing. People opening and locking doors around us all night. 
Breakfast was nice as was the dining area. 
Staff encountered while there were very friendly. 
Overall was a nice stay in a convenient location. The only thing that would make me think twice about staying again is after checking out I realised I had left my charger in the room plugged in beside the lamp. I called the hotel and was told they’ll check and call me back. Nearly 3 hours later I hadn’t gotten a call back so I rang again to be told the charger wasn’t found and maybe a guest that checked in after me took it.",3,2024,06,21
233,"Beautiful Lodging, Excellent Service","The lodging was very nice, in a lovely historic home that sits in a much less touristy neighborhood (if you are a tourist, you'll probably want a car!). Breakfast in the conservatory was delicious and service was very good--indeed, service at all times during our stay was excellent. The only snag was that an event at the nearby stadium (a rugby playoff game) caused road closures and mobs of foot traffic just as we were attempting to park. Not sure what the Ariel House could have done, as we had checked with the stadium before booking and they showed no events planned.",5,2024,06,18
233,"Beautiful, friendly hotel with amazing food","What a wonderful experience.  This is a beautiful hotel with lovely staff. We stayed in the William Butler Yeats room - one of my favourite poets so that was a great start.  The room was really beautiful with very pretty furniture and an incredibly comfortable bed.  There was endless hot water too.  
We waited in the very comfortable drawing room for our room to be ready - where we could avail ourselves of free coffee, tea, water and cakes.  We were checked in early and then able to go and explore the area which is very pretty with lots of good shops and cafes - though not the cheapest part of Dublin! 
Breakfast was a delightful treat every day and whoever makes the little scones deserves a special mention - I have never had such light and delicious scones and I’m a member of the National Trust! 
All the staff were friendly, helpful and professional.  
Highly recommended - fabulous hospitality.",5,2024,06,16
233,Great stay!,Fabulous breakfast. Sizable room that fit 3 quite well. Free parking a huge benefit. Early check-in for a small fee very helpful for travelers from the West. Close to downtown and next door to Aviva Stadium. Staff very kind and gracious. We loved our stay.,5,2024,06,14
233,Just amazing Hotel,"Just amazing Hotel.
The service we received from The General Manager Keila and her team was exceptional.
From the moment we arrived to the time we left on Sunday nothing was too much for the staff. The breakfast was just amazing and excellent food and service",5,2024,06,11
233,"Exceptional service, charming interiors and convenient location","A five-star experience from check-in to check-out. Interiors were beautifully quirky and old world with Irish designers to be seen like Nicholas Mosse pottery. We were upgraded to a suite by Chitrangee who was beautifully-mannered, upbeat and professional. She offered us tips on dining nearby and ensured we had everything for our rooms. Could not have been more pleasant and warm. All the staff were friendly and professional and breakfast was delicious, with a choice of continental or full Irish and high quality ingredients  - not the usual slap-up fry you'd expect from a B&B. I've stayed in an awful lot of hotels in Dublin and this was only bettered by the Westbury which is around €180+ more expensive. Such a convenient location with a lovely Avoca lifestyle store just a stone's throw away for mid-morning coffee cravings. 
We sat in the drawing room and had freshly baked small cakes and herbal teas after our night out.
Great atmosphere and lovely staff. Spotless too with excellent water pressure in the shower.",5,2024,06,11
233,Great first time in Dublin!,"Stayed at Ariel House with my daughter. The accommodations were lovely and clean. The staff was helpful and friendly and the breakfast was very adequate. It is in an excellent location that has a lovely neighborhood feel and, if you are a walker, is within walking distance of many of the popular sites and restaurants. Would definitely stay here again!",4,2024,06,07
233,"Really lovely hotel, great staff","Great service from friendly, helpful staff. Lovely clean, warm room with all the necessary facilities. The hotel was quiet and had a nice calm, relaxed and friendly feel. Breakfast was amazing with so many choices of continental and cooked options, most giving you a taste of the real Ireland. Good location too, close to shops and some restaurants, and within 25 mins walking distance from the city centre.",5,2024,05,29
233,Lovely place to stay in Dublin,"Ariel House is a very comfortable, beautifully presented guest house in the shadow of the Lansdowne Road stadium. There is a metro rail station very close by for quick access into Dublin centre. Alternatively, it’s about a 15 minute walk. 

They have their own car park. 

Breakfast was very yummy, with a range of cooked options.

The staff were very helpful and hospitable. 

(We left an important item behind, which they found and looked after so that we could pick it up when we came back for the ferry a week later. Extra helpfulness points!)

We were not there when a match was on at the stadium. That may make getting in and out tricky.",4,2024,05,27
233,Hospitality at its Finest,"The hospitality of the whole staff was so warm and welcoming.  The morning breakfast was incredible, and the afternoon tea and sweets were nice to come back to everyday.  The location was good for walking Dublin and the staff answered all of our questions to help us get around.",5,2024,05,25
233,Great base to explore Dublin,"This hotel was in a perfect location to explore Dublin, walkable or DART if you want, DART being a 2 minute walk away. Our welcome was great and Engin assisted with an early check in which was amazing and really appreciated.  There is a lovely area to relax in and the room was pristine and very relaxing. Breakfast was perfect, not rushed at all and the staff were attentive and helpful. We'd definitely stay here again on our next visit to Dublin. Plus there are some really good places to eat and drink nearby without going into Dublin centre if you want a quieter experience. ",5,2024,05,21
233,Relaxing and Lovely,Really amazing place to stay! Great breakfast food and device and a nice walk from the city center (maybe around 25 mins)which is nice to get away from the crowds. A nice walk to the ocean as well. Very peaceful and lovely. Would recommend!!!!,5,2024,05,19
233,"It seems luxurious, but it's not worth the money","From the outside the house looks luxurious. Although you could see there was some maintenance needed. The drawing room is stylish. While I was waiting for my room I got free coffee and cakes. So I expected the same quality level in my room. But I was disappointed: the decoration of the room was a mixture of everything and one light in the bathroom was broken. The shower was definitely not a shower you expect in a luxury guesthouse: it was constructed so close to the wall that I couldn't wash my hair properly. 
The bed was smaller than I expected.  For two persons it would be to small to have a proper sleep (and that's what a guesthouse is about). The mattress was too hard. 
The breakfast was good, especially the quality of the food. Because of the capacity of the eating room (and the kitchen) there were 2 shifts in breakfast. The second morning I had to wait for half an hour to get seated. For me is it is important to have a relax start of the day. And for me it was not relaxed. 
A tip for the owner: use your back garden as a area where people can relax and enjoy flowers.",3,2024,05,14
233,"Great location, excellent staff.","Excellent staff - everyone is very helpful, very good breakfast food, and a very nice bedroom with a very comfortable bed. The location is perfect for walking into the city center, but is in a quiet location. Also right beside the Dart station.",5,2024,05,12
233,3 days around Dublin ,"Amazing breakfast and staff, very nice Victorian house, completely renovated and close to the Lansdowne Road Station, 20-minute walk to the city center. The free coffee is a plus, as well as the breakfast choice (both at buffet and a la carte). Definitely recommended if visiting Dublin, good quality for money compared to other hotels in Dublin, free parking if you come by car. I really enjoyed my 3 days in Dublin, thanks to this hotel. ",5,2024,04,28
233,Great intro to Ireland,Beautiful guest house in a lovely area! So easy to get to the Dublin City Center via DART but it was nice to be in a quieter part of the city. The staff was wonderful and the breakfast was delicious. The room was spacious with a nice view of the garden.,5,2024,04,26
233,Ariel House stay,"Such an elegant & unique guest house.Our room was bright and airy with a very comfortable king size bed and we had everything what we needed for  a comfortable stay.Complimentary tea/coffee & cakes in their lobby is a lovely touch which was much appreciated. Their breakfast is fabulous nice spread of continental items such as cereals, scones, pastries, cheeses etc and a la carte served hot breakfast which was fantastic! All of the staff members encountered were friendly & helpful. We can’t wait to return! Highly recommend Ariel house while  visiting Dublin.",5,2024,04,23
233,Marvelous,"Looks like a beautiful Victorian Era home. Ambience soothing. Staff par excellence tending to guests needs with a warm smile. Thank you Talia, Kayla, Mariana & Emerson. 
The Breakfast superb. Absolutely loved the smoked salmon with mini potato cakes, fresh baked pastries. Savoured each bite.",5,2024,04,21
233,A beautiful lodging that needs a little tweaking to be perfect,"Ariel House is a beautiful old house in a great location away from downtown  Dublin and situated steps away from a  train station. It is surrounded by well-kept walkup brownstone houses, close to some government embassies, a park, and little shopping areas.  Our room was large, newly redone, and wonderful.  Coffee and cake in the drawing room is a great idea, but more care  could be taken to tidy the used cups, etc. Breakfast was high quality, but the room was often full which resulted in a short wait. Perhaps staggered breakfast times might help.",4,2024,04,19
233,Great location.,Great location in Dublin. Very good breakfast and the late checkout (midday) is a great bonus. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Onsite parking is another added bonus for this part of Dublin. The room itself was ok - could do with some minor updates. All in all I would definitely recommend Ariel House.,5,2024,04,15
233,A real home from home,"A real home from home the Ariel House Hotel is like a warm hug! All the staff we helpful and really lovely. Lovely beds,  fluffy pillows and first class breakfasts in the stunning conservatory. The hotel is situated in a quiet area and we had really good sleep. Really family friendly and the kids loved the drawing room with endless tea, freshly made cakes and games.  Good parking and a 12 pm checkout were very welcome. The only really minor con was that the heating was on full blast and the hotel was really hot but was fine when we turned our room radiator down. Will certainly stay there again on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2024,04,14
233,Amazing stay in Dublin,"Amazing hotel, with really nice rooms. Good service and kind staff.
Room had all needed furniture and even some tea/coffee. Beddings, towels, robes, slippers were present.
(Nice point we had 2 eu adapted chargers and 4 usb).
On breakfast there were some ready-made options (like cereal, bread, muffins, fruits) and the actual breakfast options from menu with waitresses ready to consult regarding allergies.",5,2024,04,01
233,Amazing short stay,"Big rugby weekend , so Ariel House was a perfect location . Staff at Ariel are so accommodating and look after their guests with a smile.
The complimentary coffee and cakes is well appreciated and the breakfast was exceptional 😊. 
If I could give 6 stars I would !!",5,2024,03,17
233,Five star stay!,"We have stayed at Ariel house many times and it is always a five star experience. The staff are always so welcoming and accommodating, they go above and beyond to make sure your stay is perfect. The rooms are very comfortable and the breakfast is exceptional, using the freshest and the best ingredients. There is a beautiful sitting room for guests to sit and relax, where you can also enjoy complimentary tea and coffee and some delicious homemade cakes and cookies. A big thank you to Keila and all the staff for taking such good care of us during our recent stay.",5,2024,03,17
233,A very charming stay in Dublin.,"The Ariel House is beautiful and the staff are exceptionally helpful.  The breakfast is delicious and filled with Irish favorites.  We have stayed there on 3 occasions and definitely recommend the Ariel House.  Close to mass transit that will take you to City Centre and within walking distance of many shops, pubs and restaurants.

There are two caveats.  #1 - if you are driving yourself, parking is extremely limited and the spaces are very narrow and close.  #2 - there are steps up to the entry and all rooms require using stairs.  No lifts are available.

Still, the Ariel House will not disappoint.",4,2024,03,13
233,Wonderful Stay,"I gifted my parents a stay at this beautiful hotel, and they had a fantastic time. The rooms were super clean and comfortable, and the breakfast was rich and varied. What I particularly emphasize is the kindness, courtesy, and availability of the entire staff, to whom I would give 100 stars if possible. Congratulations and thank you very much to everyone!",5,2024,03,07
233,Excellent Return Visit ,"Everything was perfect for my four night stay.  The staff so helpful and polite. The room exquisite and clean and comfortable and roomy.  Nice and warm.

The breakfast was fantastic and included in the rate.

This place is a hidden gem and attracts so many repeat clients. Could not be more convenient for the DART to town - three stops - and to Bray.

Balls Bridge is a classy location with very good restaurants and bars.

I would stay in no other place in Dublin.",5,2024,03,02
233,Never disappoints,"We decided to go away for the night at the last minute. Booked direct and got a great price. When we arrived at reception, we were met with a beaming smile, a welcome back, and an upgrade . Ariel has continued its tasteful redevelopment and refurbishment whilst maintaining its high levels of charm, comfort, service, and their cracking breakfast.",5,2024,02,28
233,Great location excellent staff,Excellent accommodation. The staff were so helpful the lounge is a lovely space to relax and have a drink. The breakfast is wonderful and again served by very attentive staff. The manager was very accommodating and the location was excellent. Overall an excellent place to stay made all the more special by the care and attention of the staff.,5,2024,02,27
233,Found a gem when I found Arial House,"Fabulous accommodation in a great location. Walking distance to Aviva, Bord Gáis etc Customer service excellent. Breakfast exquisite. Decore beautiful. Quaint period residence. Great for business or pleasure in a beautiful area in Dublin.",5,2024,02,27
233,Lovely place in a great location,"Great location with easy public transit access to city center and a lot of nearby restaurants. Breakfast was delicious every day, and they were very accommodating to the couple requests that we had. We also got upgraded to a room with a larger bed at no charge, which was fantastic.",5,2024,02,24
233,Old School Cool,"Exceptional Customer service. Engin at reception checked us in and went the extra mile right from the off. Every member of staff that we encountered were fantastic. The house is spotless and extremely comfortable. Proper heavyweight blackout lined curtains made for a good, undisturbed sleep in the most comfortable of beds despite even with the room facing the road. Our room was well appointed, warm and cozy and super clean. We felt pampered during our stay. Breakfast was lovely, and there were plenty of extra items on the buffet.  I particularly appreciated the staff getting us a little box for some scones etc when one of our party was not well enough to attend breakfast, that was kind. Thank you all, I look forward to our next visit.",5,2024,02,17
233,Nice and quiet,"The area is quiet and close to the Dart station. The staff was all very friendly and the breakfast was tasty. We like the assortment of cheeses and pastries while we waited on our hot meal. The room was comfortable and large enough for the three adults. The shower was a little tricky, but we managed to figure it out. Only complaint was that the heat wasn't keeping the room very warm. The front desk was able to provide a space heater which helped a lot.",5,2024,02,17
233,Satisfaction guaranteed!,"We have made a number of return visits to Ariel House so that speaks for itself. The staff are lovely, the rooms are spotless and the breakfasts are outstanding. Free parking also makes it even more appealing! A 2 minute walk takes you to the train station so that’s another added bonus.",5,2024,02,16
233,Excellent Hotel. Great Location.,"This is an excellent hotel, with great staff, service and surroundings. 

It’s perfectly situated for those who are wanting to see a little bit more of Dublin, whilst also being well connected via the 703 airbus to the airport and the DART train on Landsdowne Road.

Service was excellent, with all staff ably assisting us and helping where needed. The drawing room, coffee and cakes, as well as the ‘honest bar’ (!) create a welcoming and warm atmosphere. 

The breakfast was excellent, well-prepared and again well served. I would highly recommend adding breakfast on to your stay, as this set us up perfectly for our days out. 

The room was spacious, with only the bathroom being a slight weak spot. In our room, the bathroom seemed disproportionally small and the bath/shower wasn’t hot enough to really get the most out of. However, this  didn’t detract from our stay. We loved Ariel House and would be happy to go back again…",5,2024,02,15
233,"Clean, spacious, comfy bedrooms with delicious breakfast & friendly staff","I have stayed in Ariel House a number of times over the years and it never disappoints.  Gorgeous, spacious bedroom with comfy bed. Delicious breakfast, friendly staff and an impressive sustainability ethos. I would highly recommend and will certainly return. ",4,2024,02,10
233,Not positive surprised. The renovation was only a face-lift.,"Have stayed years ago in 2 or 3 occasions in the Ariel House and only came back because it was announces as “renovated”. 
Have seen on the web the pictures of the Deluxe Superior Double and booked. 
The Surprise is that it wasn’t mentioned that the bathrooms are not renovated, and we had a bathtub-shower in which is impossible to take a “normal” shower, because of a fix and very high positioned shower head.
Also, the windows and doors are not renovated. The window in our rooms had so much space that it made noise all night because of the strong wind, which is trespassing easy through the gaps.
That make a hell of cold air passing from the window cross the rooms true the BIG gaps of the door.
That door gaps also bringing the whole night light the rooms. 
In resume, no satisfying shower during 4 days of our stay.
Cold room because of the permanent air flow.
Not satisfying sleep because of the night light from the floor. 
The renovation was only a face-lift. 
Looks only nice, but the important things are NOT renovated.
Yes, there was also one good thing. – The mattress in the room was exceptional good.",2,2024,02,05
233,Nice and cosy night stay,"Very nice and relaxing atmosphere. Also very quiet, which is a must if you had a long and busy day. Just a walking distance away from all the restaurants if you decide to go for dinner. 
Staff are all very nice and friendly. Very helpful too.
Breakfast was delicious. Will definitely be staying again",5,2024,01,30
233,Luxury Guest House near the RDS,"Very well kept luxury guest house. Great breakfast - same as last January 2023. Everything was suitable even for any fussy guest, who might contemplate booking. The guest house (though it is an old building)  is immaculately turned out. Being",5,2024,01,29
233,Lovely stay at Ariel House,"Very friendly and welcoming reception staff.  Sny queries were answered and nothing was any trouble.  
Room & bathroom were spotlessly clean. Great facilities and wonderful lounge to relax with a complimentary hot drink.  
Dart Station just down the street.
Limited parking but not a huge issue in January.  
Breakfast menu catered for all diets.   
I'd certainly recommend Ariel House and would stay again next time I visit Dublin.",4,2024,01,24
233,Wonderful birthday treat. thank you.  Will 100% be back.,"Gem of a hotel.  Beautiful spacious rooms, Friendly and attentive staff Engin was so helpful on front desk, convenient to dart and Aviva stadium.  Facilities great. Honesty bar is a lovely touch. Decor is beautiful. Breakfast was lovely, great choice.",5,2024,01,16
233,great place to stay,"Friendly welcome, excellent breakfast. Comfortable beds. Close to public transport. All the staff were helpful. The ""garden view"" was a bit depressing but the rest of the hotel is smart and welcoming. Very clean.",4,2024,01,12
233,The best stay in Dublin!,"This is the most charming inn! The rooms are beautifully and classically appointed. The staff is attentive and kind. Spend part of your afternoon or evening in the drawing room where you'll enjoy tea and complimentary treats. Breakfast is served in the conservatory each morning. You'll be located just steps from the DART station, which will get you anywhere in the city. We will be back the next time we come to see our family in Dublin!",5,2023,12,26
233,PERECT LITTLE GEM,"Perfect from start to finish
We travelled 17th December 23 for 2 nights to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary I emailed the hotel before and was giving a fabulous upgrade to a junior suite check in guy was very informative and booked us tickets for Dublin city bus tour we were within 2 minutes walk to the start station and only 2 stops took us into Dublin centre.
 Lovely complimentary coffee and cakes and breakfast was amazing. All staff very friendly .
I work in travel and tourism and would highly reccomend this hotel.many thanks for making our stay special. 

",5,2023,12,19
233,Not the experience it once was ,"Have stayed here many times over the past  9 years (3 times this year alone) but things seem to have changed. The breakfast no longer compares to what  is was even compared to what they recently shared across social media. Quality is way down on the past, I thought last month was a once off but going back there this weekend was 2nd time it wasn't at its former high standard. 

Also for hotel that was always helpful, their refusal to be flexible with the booking was a big turnoff. With 3 days to go before my booking a personal issue came up and they refused to cancel or at very least change booking date. This meant going there just to use the room that I had paid for rather than letting it go to waste. I would have planned to stay there several times next year, so helping with this unforseen circumstances could have been as simple as moving the reservation but instead I will look elsewhere . 

The staff I have met face to face are always helpful and friendly and the rooms are comfortable but something has definitely changed with the management of hotel that was once extremly welcoming.",3,2023,12,16
233,10/10 Stay in Heart of Dublin,We can’t say enough about our stay!! We wish we knew the name of the guy who helped us because he was phenomenal + gave us a free upgrade to a suite our last night! (I think his name starts with an A). Great location and beautiful rooms! ,5,2023,12,05
233,Lovely stay ,"Lovely big family room, 2 adults 2 kids. friendly staff, good location 2 mins to dart, less than 20 mins stroll into town. Lovely breakfast. Relaxed atmosphere. Reasonably priced. Free parking. Would stay again.  ",5,2023,12,05
233,A magnificent hotel in Dublin,"What a wonderful hotel! In a magnificent neighborhood full of victorian houses and tall trees, the hotel has a homely ,cosy atmosphere. So nice that you hardly want to leave it and explore Dublin.  For Ariel house the experience  begins from early in the morning, that's why the breakfast served is delicious. Finally the staff that contributed to our wonderful experience ,is polite, smiling,  ready to provide suggestions and solutions to make our stay better. We returned home but still thinking of our James Joyce suite. 
Thank you Ariel !
",5,2023,12,05
233,Beautiful house and lovely surroundings,"The moment you arrive you know it is going to be nice. Lovely looking from the outside and very welcoming on the inside.
The breakfast was amazing.
The staff were all really nice.
The only gripe I had was that we had a room in an annexe which was quite cold even after the heat had been on.
Would not put me off though and would definitely visit again.",5,2023,12,04
233,Ariel House,This a great place to stay. Kind and helpful staff and very peaceful place. We had a really nice time. The staff are always ready to give good advice and were extremely supportive. We found it to be reasonably priced and they prove a great breakfast. We will definitely be back.,5,2023,11,28
233,"Hidden Gem, Highly Recommend!","Highly recommend! I stayed at Ariel House on a trip with family earlier this year. The hotel is charming, clean, and the staff very friendly. The location for us was perfect. It is easy to get into the center of town via the DART but my family and I enjoyed the 20 minute walk into town each day. The neighborhood is safe and has several bars and restaurants within a short walk of the hotel. Ariel House is also easy to get to from the airport. From the airport, you can take the airport shuttle bus and walk about 10 minutes from the bus stop to Ariel House which is what we opted to do. It is also a fairly short taxi ride, I believe about 20 - 30 minutes depending on traffic. The breakfast is also delicious--cannot recommend enough! I will absolutely stay here again the next time I find myself in Dublin! ",5,2023,11,27
233,We will come again,"Wonderful place. Helpful personnel and clean rooms. In perfect quiet place of the town. You can go on walk everywhere. 
They have a small parking but they trying to expand it and even if you are not finding there they help you where to go. 
Everything perfect.",5,2023,11,27
233,Great stay,"We really enjoyed our quick, one night stay. Englin at check in and check out was most pleasant and we’re grateful for the comp upgrade to a superior room. The lobby with 24/7 coffee & tea was beautiful and relaxing. Overall the place is beautifully decorated. Room was gorgeous, bed was comfy. Coming from the trade myself, I was very happy with the customer service at reception, thank you. 
Free parking was great and distance to Dart to the city excellent! 
I enjoyed breakfast, great choice and the quality of the food, however, I would comment on the lack of organisation by the breakfast team. When we were seated, we weren’t explained how the menu works so we found out when we were asked for our order. The toast came while we were eating porridge and granola, so perhaps that could be delivered together with the main as it gets cold by then. Often juice glasses were not stocked and got people asking and waiting for them. I overheard a table next to us also seeking instruction on how to order so perhaps the kind waitresses could ask guests are they familiar with the system and if not, explain to the guest before asking can they take their order. I think the breakfast lacked organisation in general and could be improved so this may just be a point for management to consider, we loved our stay otherwise. ",4,2023,11,25
233,A most enjoyable stay,"A warm welcome to a most comfortable establishment. We enjoyed a complimentary coffee and homemade cake in the lounge on arrival. Our deluxe room was well equipped. A short walk brought us to a host of good restaurants in Ballsbridge. The breakfast was delicious, cooked to order and beautifully presented. I will definitely stay again. We availed of free onsite parking but another major plus is the proximity of the house to Lansdowne road dart station. One could leave your car at home and enjoy the freedom of an excellent public transport system which services this bnb so well. A quality hotel overall. ",5,2023,11,17
233,Comfortable Relaxing Dublin Stay,"Location in Ballsbridge was great, and easy for Uber pick ups. 
Check in was pretty seamless and personalized. 
Room as described - spacious, with super comfortable bed. Bathroom was typical size (not large) - had the half glass shower partition.
An extra benefit was tea / coffee in the main sitting room with freshly baked pastry bites - really nice to wind down after a long day.
Breakfast was very good - main dish (good selection). The scones were a bit hard for my preference but that was no biggie since there were quite a few other options.
Would definitely stay again next time I’m in Dublin!",5,2023,11,15
233,Wonderful stay as ever!,"Stayed over nite last Wednesday with my sister in law.  I have stayed here many many times before & it never fails to deliver a 5* experience. We arrived around 1pm to a warm welcome at reception where we were told  that our room was ready. We then enjoyed complementary tea/coffee/cake in their beautiful front drawing room….yummy when their charming customer services manager Engin enquired if we were happy with our room etc. I have seldom encountered this degree of customer service before….. Our room was clean & comfortable, the bathroom small but adequate. The issue with poor TV channels coverage needs addressed. The breakfast was as delicious as ever. Thank you to all concerned! ",5,2023,11,12
233,Fabulous stay at Ariel House,"On arrival we were greeted by a friendly member of staff who offered complimentary upgrades. Fortunately our rooms were available before checkin time…. brilliant! Our room & bathroom were spacious, spotlessly clean & comfortable. 
We really appreciated the complimentary tea/coffee, delicious cakes & biscuits in the drawing room. A perfect way to relax after a busy day out. Breakfast menu offered a wide variety of options, my fruit & eggs were delicious. Must also mention the very tasty wheaten/brown soda too. All staff at breakfast were very competent & friendly.
Will definitely be returning to Ariel House.",5,2023,11,11
233,"Ariel House was ""Home"".","My daughter and I stayed at the Ariel House for a holiday in Ireland, traveling from the   US. We had a short time to visit Ireland and planned to travel outside of Dublin. We loved the city and found the public transportation easy to manage. We absolutely loved the Ariel House and decided to check back in to stay multiple nights - forgoing our original plans. The hosts were so accommodating, the lodgings were perfect, and we felt very at home. The beds were comfortable, the staff friendly, and the breakfast perfect. I highly recommend staying here. ",5,2023,11,08
233,Quiet and Stately Accommodations,Very stately and comfortable accommodations located conveniently near a DART train station.  Staff very professional and helpful.  Breakfast was tastefully done with options for a Continental or hot breakfast to order.  Highly recommended!,5,2023,11,06
233,Night away,"Clean, comfortable room, friendly and helpful staff. 24 hour reception. Lovely drawing room with free tea, coffee and cake during the day. 2 min walk to the dart station and 7 mins walk to Rolys restaurant where we had a lovely meal. Id definitely recommend this guesthouse ",5,2023,11,06
233,Lovely experience. ,"This was our second stay at Ariel House and it did not disappoint.  Very quiet at night, comfortable bed, fabulous breakfast, lovely staff.  Thank you all at Aerial House for a very enjoyable stay.   We'll be back .... soon I hope.",5,2023,11,06
233,A welcome oasis,"Always comfortable; fabulous team service and kindness; thoughtful response to specific queries and freshly created breakfasts to die for; I always go back when I want a restful, comfortable stay.  Fully recommended.",5,2023,11,03
233,Great night catching up with family.,Great friendly staff. Breakfast excellent. I am coeliac and was very well catered for. The rooms were clean and tidy. The whole atmosphere in Ariel house was very friendly with helpful staff. I can recommend this hotel to other travellers.,5,2023,10,30
233,excellent but not worth four stars,The beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The bathroom is in need of renovation as it looks worn and for example water runs everywhere when you turn on the tap. Also the windows don't close properly and need to be repaired. The breakfast and all the little gadgets everywhere are outstanding.,4,2023,10,27
233,Lovely accomodation in Dublin,"My adult children and I comfortably shared a spacious, single room.  The bathroom is large and luxuriously appointed.  The beds were comfortable, dressed is spotless, crisp white linens.  We looked forward to breakfast every morning, with the amazing view from the large windows.  We would love to return when we next visit Dublin. ",5,2023,10,26
233,Reasonable priced Dublin hotel,"This is a very reasonably priced hotel  in Dublin which comes with parking should you need it. 
This was our third stay. We stayed the first time for our son’s graduation from UCD. It turned out to be a great choice. The rooms are very clean and quiet, breakfast is good and we’ve always found the staff to be helpful. The Dart station is only a few minutes walk so central Dublin (or Greystones/Malahide) are very accessible. The Aircoach from Dublin airport stops nearby and best of all, the Avoca food market is a short walk away 😋
If you wanted to be picky, you could say the bathrooms need to be updated but we’ve only ever stayed for a night or two and they are more than acceptable.

233,"1 night stay, attending a function in Aviva beside Ariel house.","Just home from a 1 night stay in Ariel house and would highly recommend it. On arrival I was disappointed by our room, it was on the lower floor with bad condensation trapped in the window, and we were immediately moved to a brighter, nicer 1st floor room when I spoke to reception. The bed linen and bed were very comfortable. The breakfast was delicious and beautifully presented. Free coffe, cakes and an honesty bar were nice extras. A beautiful, old Georgian house which is a bit worn in places (carpets, paintwork, windows) but this just added to the charm.",5,2023,10,22
233,Very well presented with friendly staff. ,"On arrival we were greeted at the top of the entrance steps by 2 very friendly staff members welcoming us to the hotel. The hotel is a grand old house that has been converted. 
After a quick check in we were shown through a bit of a rabbit warren to our room. I think the house has extended over the years to include the house next door and a new building to join the 2 together so its a lot of hallways, staircases and twist and turns to get anywhere. 
The room was well presented with a lux feel and very clean. We had booked through an online booking site so as expected our view wasn't great.. the gravel patch along side the house but that was ok as we didn't plan on spending much time there anyway. 

Breakfast was included, a pretty good selection but small serves of hot food accompanied by a continental breakfast selection you could fill up on. Try and get a seat in the conservatory section if you can.. its beautiful in the mornings.
A Nescafe pod coffee machine was a sight for sore eyes after 34 hours travelling from Australia with airline coffee. 

The same machine is also available in the beautifully decorated and furnished shared sitting room 27 hours and is complementary. 

We didn't interact with the staff very much as we were always out all day but the people we did meet were lovely. They have a very diverse staff and we only heard one Irish accent the whole time we were there. 

The location was good, walking distance to shops and a few restaurants and there is a train station about 100m away that can take you pretty much into the heart of Dublin. 

Lovely stay all told

233,Lovely staff in a beautiful home,"We stumbled into the Ariel Guest House after an overseas flight, hoping to be able to leave our luggage and explore a bit of Dublin while still on our feet. We were greeted warmly, invited to take a seat and have coffee and pastry in the lovely living space, and given maps and directions to the city. Our room was lovely and comfortable, and the Irish breakfast was better than we could have imagined. We literally rolled out to explore Dublin each morning. The house itself is beautiful, but the warmth and helpfulness of staff was the best part of our stay. ",5,2023,10,20
233,Wonderful,"The Ariel House was perfect to begin our trip to Ireland.  The location was out of the Dublin fray and within walking distance to the train.  The rooms were very clean - a bit sparce, but quiet.  After sightseeing all day, it was good to have a place that was so quiet.  The breakfasts were amazing and the staff super friendly and helpful.  I would highly recommend Ariel House if you don't want to stay in the city.  ",5,2023,10,18
233,A trip down memory lane.,"We have just returned from a lovely complimentary overnight stay in Ariel House.My husband & I first stayed here on our honeymoon in 1980.The interior is totally unrecognisable ,it is a stunning,welcoming and comfortable place to stay. The lounge is beautiful and relaxing,the tea & coffee and delicous cakes were a welcome treat.Our room was very clean ,spacious and very comfortable. The staff were very welcoming pleasant and informative.The breakfast was delicous and the young staff very attentive.It was lovely to remember our honeymoon and we definitely wont be leaving it 43 years to return.",5,2023,10,11
233,Another good visit.,"As regular visitors to Ariel House we had, once again, an excellent stay. The bedrooms and lounge have recently been upgraded and are very comfortable and welcoming.  On arrival, we were early, there was tea, coffee and cakes in the lounge while we waited. When our room was ready our luggage was taken to it so no carrying while using the stairs. The breakfast was excellent as usual and set us up for the day.  After checking out we left our luggage while we went out and on our return the receptionist carried the luggage down the front steps. He was also very keen that we have refreshments before we left which on this occasion we declined. Hopefully we will be back again next month. It is such a convenient place to stay, so close to the Dart which takes you towards Greystones or Howth via Dublin City centre. We highly recommend Ariel House.",5,2023,10,10
233,Dublin Gift,"Ariel House was recommended to us and lived up to expectation. Easy to get into Dublin. Great parking. Good local pubs nearby.
Our rooms were small, ok for what we paid. Water pressure in shower was poor. Breakfast was great. Service was perfect, especially Manager lady. Would return anytime",5,2023,10,10
233,The vacation we tried to go on for 25 years culminated with our stay as the icing on our cake so to speak. ,"A top flight place to stay with professional and friendly staff and a great neighborhood location. Checking in was easy, parking was accessible and there were multiple eating establishments and pubs or shops within walking distance. It is also blocks from the stadium for sporting events and concerts. Thank you!",5,2023,10,05
233,Simply Perfect ,"An absolutely top quality stay last Friday night in Ariel House. The property is amazing, superb location in South Dublin, close to the City and all attractions. We had the perfect night away, great room, super sleep, fantastic home cooked breakfast. What made the stay simply outstanding was the staff and the service. Nothing too much trouble, so friendly and accommodating. Usually, we would stay in a typical Hotel, however, Arial House was so much better and we can't wait to stay there again. Simply perfect. Catherine ",5,2023,09,28
233,Spotty service. Too many guests for what the staff can handle,"We were disappointed with the ""meh"" service we received from some of the staff. For starters, we are older people and I have orthopedic issues. There are steep steps going into the property and our room was on a floor that also entailed a lot of steps.  The issue was struggling with our bags (we were on a lengthy trip and two of our cases were large) and the young people at the front desk not being very helpful with that in spite of seeing us struggle with the cases.
 In addition, the pillows were terrible. The housekeeping staff did try to find fluffier ones, but those were only marginally better.
 Breakfast is nice, but there were some large groups staying there and the wait for breakfast was often lengthy. The waiting area in the Drawing Room would also get crowded. The management should probably set up a reservation system for breakfast, especially when there are large groups booked. 
 Our room was nice, clean, and quiet. The housekeeping staff were great. The front desk guys were hit or miss. One of them seemed absolutely bored and I felt like we were interrupting him with our interactions.
 The area is nice with good restaurants, pharmacy, and a Centra shop not far away. The Dart train is just down the road and we used that a lot (we bought a Leap card at the nearby post office that one can use on the buses, trams, and trains all over the city.)
 We stayed at Ariel House for 5 days. It was a splurge for us, but we came away underwhelmed.
 ",3,2023,09,27
233,High standard ,"Stayed one night with friends as part of a road trip. Very clean and comfortable room. Breakfast was delicious. We used a taxi into Dublin as it isn’t central. It’s a quiet hotel with a sitting room with complimentary water, coffee and cake. Very happy with this choice of hotel.",5,2023,09,27
233,Clean but lacking,"We arrived early, the room wasn't ready, but a room we also reserved for the next day was ready. We could check in to a smaller room right then. We chose to wait for our Junior Suite. We checked at 1pm, still not ready. Finally at 4:30 we checked in. That night I felt something weird in the bed. The duvet cover was torn. Every time I straightened my legs I felt it and woke up. Not a five star room with a torn cover! The next day the family tried checking in early. Knowing that the room was ready the day before I was shocked when they said they could not check in. Go sit with the rest of the tourist in the lounge. What kind of game is that? We did not have enough shampoo to last three days. The breakfast staff is VERY slow, so don't try and have a schedule. The man at the reception desk acted like he did not understand English. I had to repeat myself three of four times every time I asked for something, like the torn sheet. He didn't understand I wanted a new duvet cover. I guess I called it a comforter and he was confused. Not a very welcoming person. We chose it for location to the stadium, which it is very convenient and nice flowers in the front. Would not recommend or stay there again.",3,2023,09,24
233,Absolutely wonderful. Delicious breakfast and great location.,"Beautiful building and gardens. A drawing room to relax in and have refreshments or a drink (honesty bar). Great books on Ireland to read there plus the local newspaper. Friendly staff. Great, spacious rooms with good pillows. Bathroom was good (shower in bath) and the liquid soaps smelled divine. Close by is Avoca - the best market/deli I have ever been to. Delicious food and goodies to buy! Easy access via public transport (as it is a little out of Dublin centre).",5,2023,09,21
233,A wonderful experience ,"The staff at Ariel house were friendly and made us feel very welcome.  The rooms are tastefully done and the beds quite comfortable. 
Breakfast is amazing…. A very wide choice of freshly baked breads, muffins and scones, preserves, cheese etc followed by freshly good eggs, pancakes or a full Irish breakfast!
There is also tea, coffee and pastries laid out all day in the lounge…..
We would happily stay here again. ",5,2023,09,19
233,Charming old fashioned hotel in south Dublin,"Although I had the impression this was a typical B&B with  the hosts living there and having just a few rooms, this was more like an old fashioned hotel, which  was still very charming. There was someone manning a front desk area 24/7 and there were lots of rooms. There was one living space where you could gather, which wasn't too busy - we took up a good portion of it 2 nights in a row just reading and snacking. The breakfast was amazing! That was definitely a plus. Our room had generous space, and while there were stairs every which way, the front desk folks were more than happy and offering to bring up and down our bags for us. It isn't super close to restaurants. If walking, plan on at least 10 minutes or more. We ended up Ubering to most places. It is also about a 22 minute walk to Merrion Square, which is the closest stop for the DoDublin hop on/hop off bus. ",4,2023,09,18
233,Wonderful experience,"What a gem of a hotel located just a few train stops from the hustle and bustle of Dublin.
The staff was courteous and helpful. A special thanks to Engin
who went out of his way to make sure we were well taken care of.
The beds, breakfast and staff were amazing",5,2023,09,18
233,A wonderful place to stay,"I had a great stay at Ariel House. It is well located with good sized rooms, nice design and a lovely atmosphere.
The breakfast is exceptional with lots of choices and delicious home made options.
What really makes Ariel House stand out is the wonderful staff who are so friendly and efficient - I will definitely be back next time I am in Dublin.",5,2023,09,11
233,Loved the Ariel house!,"The Ariel House had great accommodations, was easy to get to, and had a wonderful staff. The Irish breakfast was the best we had in Dublin. It is conveniently located very close to a train station and the neighborhood is quiet. The only noise that bothered us were the rather loud doors (if catching up on sleep during the day, you may hear your neighbors door open and close loudly).",5,2023,09,10
233,Comfy and welcoming,"We were fortunate enough to stay a week at Ariel House. I have to say all the staff was friendly and helpful. They answered all our questions about the city, and gave great recommendations for places to visit and eat at. The breakfast in the mornings were delicious, and there were many options. I even heard the staff working with people with dietary restrictions. 

We will be making multiple trips to Dublin over the next 4 years and Ariel house will be a place we will stay again.",5,2023,09,09
233,Lovely stay,"Good location - 25 minute walk into central Dublin, or a few minutes on the nearby DART train. Lovely public areas - with cake provided in the afternoon. Very friendly, professional and helpful welcome. Good room. Parking.",5,2023,08,30
233,Excellent stay,"The Ariel House was absolutely lovely. The team of staff was very welcoming and assisted us with meal recommendations and booking car services. The rooms were clean, beautiful and well stocked. The morning breakfast and service was one of the best we’ve ever had. Our favorite part was the tea room, where guests could congregate to have tea/coffee/cakes, read, play games and interact with one another. It was a great way to meet others and get recommendations for our stay in Dublin. Will definitely come back.",5,2023,08,29
233,Excellent hot breakfast ,"Dated but elegant decor. Complimentary coffee, tea and cake in afternoon. Decent water pressure. Room needs floor lamps for better lighting, and in washroom.  Bizarrely no Kleenex available. Very good breakfast included (eat before 9 am, breakfast room fills up). 30 min walk from downtown Dublin. ",4,2023,08,27
233,Areil house hidden gem,Ariel hotel was brilliant in every way. It was my boyfriends birthday & we were greeted with a bottle of wine & some fresh cupcakes upon arrival which made the trip extra special . The staff are very friendly & couldnt do enough for us. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay & will definitely be back.,5,2023,08,22
233,Lovely guest house!,"Lovely place to stay. Clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. The Irish breakfast was delicious. Ariel House is conveniently located steps away from the Dart station. Engin at the front desk went above and beyond to make our stay great. He was always helpful with travel ideas and all things within the guest house. Ariel House is a must stay. ",5,2023,08,13
233,Truly outstanding!!!! ,"Just returned from a two day trip to Dublin and very lucky to have stayed at Ariel House on the middle night. What an absolute gem of a place. Outstanding in every aspect, beautiful, comfortable rooms and public areas, spotlessly clean,absolutely top class staff in all areas, warm,welcoming and always going the extra mile to ensure our stay was perfect. Breakfast was delicious, prompt attentive service , lots of choice, irish hospitality at its best. Reception staff were so helpful, helping with taxi bookings and looking after luggage until we were ready to head home, allowing us to really make the most of our days. Thank you to everyone at Ariel House, you are stars! We,ll be back!!! ",5,2023,08,11
233,Definitely recommendable!,"Lovely little hotel in a quiet area in Dublin, in walking distance (about 2km) to the city centre. Very comfortable beds, we had a spacious room, quiet at night apart from occasional train noises which did not disturb.
Very delicious breakfast, freshly made according to ones wishes, always tea and coffee available in the drawing room alongside freshly baked cake and cookies.
There are, however, only a few parking spaces and there is no lift. None of this mattered to us, but one should be aware of that (it is said on the homepage though). 
VERY friendly and helpful staff. Thankx!!! ",5,2023,08,11
233,Excellent start of our vacation,Our stay at the Ariel House was the perfect start to our vacation in Ireland.  All of the staff were attentive and went out of their way to make our stay comfortable.  Engin was particularly helpful when we checked in and during our stay.  The room was comfortable and quiet.  The breakfast was the best I had in our 10 day stay in Ireland.  Fresh baked breads and a relaxing ambience were the perfect start to our day.  The waitresses were responsive and courteous.  ,5,2023,08,09
233,Fantastic service and food,"2 night stay to visit Dublin/ family.Fantastic service.Loved the drawing room with free tea/ coffee and fresh cakes and biscuits and breakfast was great too.Our car was blocked in by another guest and Engin, on reception could not have been more helpful going above and beyond to help.",5,2023,08,06
233,Couldn't have chosen a better hotel.,"The twin room me and my sister stayed in (224) was lovely and spacious with plenty of storage space. The bed was very comfy and the bathroom had hand wash, shampoo and shower gel. Bath towels and hand towels supplied but bath sheets would have been better. So glad I picked The Ariel hotel, it was in a lovely location and just a short taxi into Dublin centre (10€). The staff were very attentive and welcoming. Lovely variety at breakfast and even supplied us with a takeaway on our first morning when we were going out early. Overall an excellent place to stay. Highly recommend. ",5,2023,08,04
233,A real find,"A hotel where comfort and service are key. From the cosy drawing room with tea and cake offered on arrival, to the spotless room , topped off by a perfect breakfast, served by efficient, well trained and friendly staff, our stay was perfect. In a world of soulless hotels, this hotel is a real find. ",5,2023,07,27
233,Very good choice in Dublin,"Very nice and tasteful. Staff is friendly and helpful. Breakfast is very good in a nice breakfast room. There is also a nice drawing room with books, chessboard and an honorary bar. 
The neighbourhood is nice with good communications.",5,2023,07,25
233,Fabulous place to stay in Dublin!,"This was a fabulous stay! The staff, from front desk to cleaners to breakfast staff, were absolutely super - friendly, helpful, and kind. The inn was very clean and the bed was comfortable. The one thing guests should note in advance is that there are a lot of stairs and doors to navigate getting to and from your room. This did not bother us but it might bother some. The shared living room area was so lovely - treats in the evening and (good!) coffee / tea 24/7, plus alcohol on the honor system which was appreciated. The front desk team were very helpful and provided us with a map, and then booked hop-on hop-off bus tour for us as well as an airport taxi and then changed it when our flight was delayed. The breakfast was SO delicious!! There are two items (courses) served and a help-yourself area for additional items, all fresh and yummy. The breakfast room was beautiful. The DART rapid transit (train) station is a one-minute walk and there are restaurants and pubs about a 10 minute walk away which were good as well. Definitely great value for money and I hope we can go back to stay here again!",5,2023,07,23
233,Best night's sleep ever!,"What a wonderful night's sleep! I felt as if I was living in the lap of luxury. I spent time in the drawing room on the first evening, planning the next day. The receptionist helped me make tea, and helped others with the whiskey that was available - on the honor system!",5,2023,07,23
233,Excellent stay at Ariel House,A really enjoyable stay. Staff are excellent. Food delicious. Beds so comfortable. So convenient to train and straight lovely walk into Dublin centre. We will highly recommend and we will certainly be back. ,5,2023,07,22
233,Dublin Stay in a Friendly Bed and Breakfast,Our stay at Ariel house was most enjoyable. The staff was really helpful in giving us information about the best way to catch the train and which stops to get off the train to get to the sights we wanted to see. We were able to borrow a large umbrella as it was raining and blowing a couple days during our stay. We needed some paperwork printed and the staff were willing to do so. The breakfast which was included in our stay was excellent and the serving staff very accommodating. Coffee and tea was always available in the comfortable lounge along with some pastries. We enjoyed our stay at Ariel House and would be happy to stay there again if our travels take us to Dublin in the future.,5,2023,07,21
233,Superb in every respect - stay here if you can,Ariel House was the highest quality accommodation we experience in Ireland  and was a superb place for the last night of our holiday. We were treated to impeccable service from friendly staff available at all times. The building is several beautiful terrace houses joined together and the bedroom/bathroom as well as the common areas are immaculately furnished. A particularly lovely touch is the guest's drawing room which features an honesty bar and fresh home made cakes for afternoon tea daily. Ariel House is just down the street from Landsdowne Park and railway station for very convenient travel to the centre of Dublin. ,5,2023,07,21
233,The best hotel and superb breakfast!!!!!!!,"First of all huge huge THANK YOU for allowing us to check in early!
( our plane arrived very early in the morning, we were super tired from a long trip and time change). We loved everything about the hotel! The room was perfect, the breakfast was superb. The staff was super helpful and polite.  Out of all of the hotels where we stayed while in Ireland, this hotel had the best breakfast!!!!!! If you are looking for an amazing place to stay while in Dublin, this place should be N.1 on your list! It is very close to the train stop ( literally 2 min walk)  and you can be on your way to Bray ( my favorite place) or Howth. Once again, huge THANK YOU to Ariel House staff for making our stay perfect!!!!!!!",5,2023,07,19
233,A lovely stay.,"Lovely and charming house, very well decorated and very clean. The staff is welcoming. Great breakfast, with different menus to choose from.  Nice pubs in the area. I'll come back for sure if again in Dublin.",5,2023,07,19
233,Awesome,"Engin and the staff were so welcoming and helpful.  I was a General Manager at a property at home for many years, I would have been proud to have any of them on my team! A very wonderful experience. Would return for sure!",5,2023,07,13
233,Lovely hotel,"We stayed at Ariel House with our family for several days. The hotel is lovely; beautiful furnishings, tastefully decorated and helpful staff. The queen room was nicer than the twin and the back of the hotel is not nearly as nice as the front. Great location in outer suburbs of Dublin. Definite walk to touristy stuff but a nice spot of tranquility. ",4,2023,07,10
233,Perfect stay,"We really enjoyed staying at Ariel House. The B&B is beautifully decorated and super cute. The beds are very comfortable and the breakfast is fantastic. The staff, especially Engin, were very charming and helpful. He helped us with our luggage and gave us great advice for our stay in Dublin. Markus & Estelle",5,2023,07,06
233,Wonder experience,"Excellent experience. Loved the location and easy access to transportation. Lovely neighborhood and welcoming feeling the entire time. The staff is top notch. Very helpful and always available for assistance. The breakfast is amazing and such a pleasant experience. The front sitting area is inviting and offers teas, coffees, alcohol, and delicious baked snacks. There are also books and games to enjoy while in the sitting room. The beds we’re comfortable and the room was kept clean and neat daily. There are restaurants and pubs within walking distance. Overall very happy with our experience and would highly recommend. ",5,2023,07,01
233,Great atmosphere and good food.,The atmosphere was great and the breakfast was outstanding.  The room was very warm but they did provide a floor fan.  It was a long walk to any of the downtown sites but it was very quiet at night.  The snacks provided in the sitting room were very good.  We only stayed one night but would have loved to stay longer.,5,2023,06,27
233,Lovely stay at Ariel House,"We stayed at the Ariel House for one night prior to leaving for a trip around Ireland. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. The rooms were cozy and comfortable after a long flight. The breakfast in the morning was delicious! Location wise, it was a lovely neighborhood and very easy to walk into town if you don’t mind walking a bit! Overall, we loved our stay and would return! ",5,2023,06,26
233,Unhappy with our stay,"Stayed one night here for our final night in Ireland. Very disappointed in our room accommodations. Stains on the ceiling, stains on the carpet, peeling plaster on the wall, dirty towel on the back of the bathroom door, terrible, loud, plumbing, sound when flushing the toilet, no AC or even a ceiling fan. Requested an early breakfast due to an early flight departure, but was told that was not available. No help with luggage upon arrival or departure. We were very disappointed with our one night stay for the over priced room of $400+. We had hoped to have an extraordinary final night before heading back to the US but instead, it was regrettably unforgettable.",1,2023,06,25
233,Welcoming and comfortable stay,"We had a wonderful welcome at Ariel House. The check in was very quick and we were invited to take complementary coffee and cake in their elegant lounge once we’d settled in.  The bed was extremely comfortable and room well appointed. The breakfast was very good with both cold and hot options, with a wide selection to choose from. We had one issue with the room which, Engin at front of house, immediately attended to and found a solution for. His customer service should be particularly commended. We would definitely stay at Ariel House again if visiting Dublin.",5,2023,06,25
233,Just an Average Accomodation,"After reading reviews and looking at online photos, we booked this B&B.  Overall, it was an average accommodation.  The good things:  location, close to public transit, breakfast was good but did not start at 7 AM as told it would(staff did not get there until after 7 AM). We had to leave at 7:30 AM for our flight and at 7 AM no coffee, no juice, fruit, just some old pastries.  Staff was kind and helpful although I do believe they should help guests with luggage as there are many, many steps to climb.  Our room, 226, was small, dingy, stained carpet, broken bathroom tiles missing grout, bathroom door hit toilet when opened.  Room looked nothing like online photos-needs serious refurbishing.  Back garden was locked?? per lobby staff.  Hallways are cramped and narrow.  Only one window could open about 6-8 inches.
I do not feel it was a good value for price we paid (498 euros) for 2 nights in a double/single room.  There are many choices in Dublin for accommodation-I would not book again at Ariel House.",3,2023,06,24
233,Hidden gem in the heart of Ballsbridge,"We had the pleasure of staying at Ariel House, and it was absolutely splendid. From the moment we arrived until our departure, everyone was incredibly kind and amicable.

The breakfast is an absolute must! It is simply delightful, and I must confess, I wish I could indulge in their breakfast at home, if only such a thing were possible!

We had numerous inquiries about Dublin and the surrounding area, all of which were met with Engin's charming smile. He patiently addressed all our queries and provided us with exceedingly helpful information. Furthermore, he was present during our check-out and kindly assisted us with our luggage, bidding us farewell like a true gentleman.

We will certainly return without hesitation. And we do recommend Ariel House to everyone. ",5,2023,06,17
233,Very Good!,"Dart station near guesthouse, very easy to get to hotel by train.

Rooms were spacious. 
Very good experience. Thank you!",5,2023,06,15
233,Perfect!,"Beautiful House, typically Irish! 2 min Wall ti The train to central Dublin, also 2 min walk to Aviva Stadium. The hotel is very quiet, the beds are amazingly comfortable and the breakfast is beautiful!
The whole staff is super friendly and helpful!
I’ll go back whenever I go back to Dublin!",5,2023,06,11
233,Lovely mood and relaxed elegance,"A one minute walk from the dart line down a leafy street. Friendly warm staff and a lovely atmosphere. Central to everything , but quite. A special mention to Engin for helping us.. we have already booked the return trip. Breakfast caters for all palates and the communal sitting room ain’t half bad either.",5,2023,06,10
233,Wonderful stay!,"Just lovely!  My husband and 3 daughters stayed here for the night as we finished our vacation in Ireland.  We were first struck by the beautiful entrance and cozy gathering room with refreshments and then were impressed by the accommodating staff as we arrived several hours early for check in.  We loved the beautiful architecture and quiet neighborhood.  Breakfast was wonderful, too!  We will definitely return and recommend to others!",5,2023,06,05
233,Dublin City Center close but not too close!,"Loved the location and the room! The Dart is a block from the hotel. Loved that there were so many amazing restaurants close by.  But the breakfast experience is not to be missed, as well as the drawing room and cakes in the afternoon! Loved every minute of our stay!",5,2023,06,03
233,A pleasant place to stay in a good location.,"A very good location, near the Aviva Stadium and a short walk from Lansdowne Road DART station (which gives access to central Dublin)  and to coastal towns such as Dun Laoghaire, Bray and Greystones)  

Complimentary coffee and cake in the lounge is nice and in the early morning there was orange juice and pastries which I sampled while waiting to go into breakfast.  Breakfast has  a good range and hot food is served to your table.

Our room was quiet and comfortable.  A couple of glitches were handled with professionalism and courtesy.  The staff were always helpful.

People with mobility issues should be aware that the entrance to this old style Dublin terrace is up a flight of steps.  You would need to enquire about other ways of access.",4,2023,06,02
233,Lovely stay!,"My family spent one night at Ariel House and very much enjoyed our stay.  The family room was large and comfortable and, although the room looked out over the street, it was quiet for sleeping even with the windows open.  We enjoyed a glass of wine at the honesty bar in the beautiful lounge.  Breakfast in the morning was plentiful and delicious.  I highly recommend Ariel House for a stay in Dublin!",5,2023,05,30
233,"Close to public transportation, comfy room, excellent bath, yummy breakfast.","We had never been to Dublin, and were looking for a safe and comfortable place that was easy to explore the city from.  Ariel House had a nice, clean room that accommodated myself, my husband, and our nineteen-year-old daughter.  It was en suite with a lovely bathtub and HOT water!  It's just a stone's throw from the railway station and a reasonable walk from good restaurants.  The breakfast was fabulous, the breakfast staff charming and eager, the sitting room comfy and pleasant...   The staff even packed us a bagged breakfast due to an early flight out our last day.  We enjoyed our stay.",5,2023,05,28
233,Ariel House a Winner for Dublin,"Perfect location for exploring Dublin away from the city hustle and bustle. Staff very helpful and friendly. They let us store luggage when arriving early and provided useful tips for local dining and transportation. The rooms were comfortable and the full breakfast outstanding. The Landsdowne Station is just a few minutes walk away, making travel to the city and beyond easy and convenient.",5,2023,05,21
233,Beautiful!,"The most beautiful place we’ve stayed in Dublin. The public spaces are magazine worthy! The breakfast was to die for. The rooms were so romantic. It’s a piece of heaven in a busy city. 

The only tricky thing is that there isn’t much parking available so arrive early to get a spot.",5,2023,05,21
233,Exceptional!,"The Ariel's House was highly recommended to me by my daughter who had stayed there with her husband and their 2 year old son. 
My husband and I spent a total of 5 nights in the B&B. We couldn't ask for a better place to stay in Dublin. 
The entire staff is outstanding. They made sure that we enjoyed our stay. 
I loved the decorations, and the feeling of being in a remarkably well maintained Victorian house.
The rooms are comfortable, and  clean. The Junior Suite is lovely.
Breakfast is served in a nice, bright room. There is a good selection of very tasty food. The staff is extremely helpful accomodating dietary requirements. 
Last but not least, Ariel's House is in Ballsbridge. A nice residential neighborhood yet with convenient access to central Dublin, the Dart is just a block away.  Walk to Trinity College is a little over 2 km.
We also found nice restaurants and coffee shops near by.
I would definitely stay at the Ariel's House again. 
Thank you for providing us with such an amazing experience!",5,2023,05,20
233,Excellent value comfortable hotel with easy transport links to cit,"Ariel house, welcoming staff, comfortable lounge with coffee and cake, decent size twin bedroom with comfortable beds. Great breakfast menu. Close to train for Dublin City centre, there are many hotels to choose from, Ariel house did not disappoint. Special mention goes to Engin Alkaya guest relations manager who certainly goes the extra mile to assist hotel guests, especially me who left a bag behind. 😩",5,2023,05,17

Fantastic breakfast. Just perfect 
We will be going back 😀",5,2023,05,11
233,Afternoon Tea and Cakes!,"Our family chose this hotel for its location to the city. As first time travelers to Ireland, we received a warm welcome and even allowed an early check in.  The rooms are cozy and the food is wonderful.  If ever in Dublin again I will definitely stay here. The Ariel House knows how to do hospitality right.",5,2023,05,11
233,Recent visit,"We enjoyed our stay in Ariel House, Staff is very friendly and professional. Breakfast was delicious. The location is perfect and the room is very clean. We thank all the reception staff for their efficiency and help; Engin, Diego, and all others.",5,2023,05,10

Breakfast was fabulous with the ever smiling Lucas serving with  Leah & Marianna. Thank you.",5,2023,05,09
233,Lovely stay,"Lovely stay.  Plenty of choices for breakfast.  
Most of the staff were good except for a few.  Had to ask for wifi password  which was not given at check in.  We were seated for breakfast and I had to ask if it was buffet style as no one explained.
  Overall a good stay.",4,2023,05,07
233,Delightful hotel & staff,"Ariel house is a charming, boutique hotel located in a quiet, residential area. The Aviva Stadium, RDS and a Dart station are within a few minutes walk. The staff are incredibly welcoming and friendly. We had a slight hiccup  with our room and Engin ensured that the issue was resolved quickly and left us an apology note together with wine and cakes - his gracious, professional approach was greatly appreciated.
The bedroom was very clean and comfortable. Although no air conditioning the windows could be opened and there were excellent blackout curtains. Ritual toiletries (pump dispensers) in the bathroom.
Breakfast was lovely - a small buffet selection of fruit, cereals, breads, juices and self service coffee followed by a starter (porridge, granola) and main (cooked to order) from the menu. Gluten free bread was available.
The cozy Drawing Room was a relaxing space to enjoy complimentary tea/coffee/fruit infused water with sweet treats. 
Engin and staff make this hotel a delight to visit!",4,2023,05,07
233,Location is ideal,"Fantastic hotel, great location and very friendly staff in particular Engin. Very clean hotel, we had a lovely bedroom 2 double beds and the slept 4 adults. Breakfast was lovely with a nice selection. Drawing room is a lovely addition to the hotel. Will definitely be back!",5,2023,05,06
233,"Enjoyable Stay, Friendly Staff, Great Location - just a few caveats","Ariel House is a lovely old place to stay, with beautiful spacious rooms. There's a DART stop half a block away, so it's easy to get to the center of Dublin in 10 minutes. The neighbourhood is pretty and relatively calm and quiet. The breakfast was tasty. The staff are friendly and accommodating. There's a pleasant sitting room with newspapers, tea and you can even help yourself to a glass of wine and some small sweet bites. I enjoyed my stay overall. 
Just a few things to keep in mind though: I asked for a quiet room several times: when booking, when confirming and when I arrived, emails and in-person. I was still shown to a room with windows that opened right onto the road. They showed me other options and we found a solution, but I think I got lucky they had open rooms that day. That surprised me; I thought this level / cost of hotel would pay attention to details like that. 
Also, the mattress had zero give to it, solid as a rock. That seems to be an Irish hotel trend because that's not the only place I found hard mattresses. Plenty of people like firm mattresses, just a heads-up in case you don't. 
The floors do creak loudly as others have mentioned, but mostly people are out and about so not a huge deal, plus earplugs help. The window in my room only opened maybe 5 inches which really restricts airflow and temperature, but I managed to turn down the heater so I could cool the room a bit at night. 
All in all, I enjoyed my stay; it's a pleasant place. ",4,2023,05,03
233,A wonderful plact to stay.,"Staying at Ariel House was an absolute delight in every way.  The staff at the 24 hour front desk were remarkably helpful and friendly (including Emerson, Engin and others), the room was very comfortable and clean, the drawing room always had coffee, tea and in the afternoon delicious cake, and the breakfast was exceptional, with made to order breakfasts including a full Irish breakfast, seating in a lovely skylight area, and friendly wait staff including Lucas and others.

We walked to town each day through a beautiful and safe neighborhood, passing restaurants, pubs and Dublin at its best.  We highly recommend Ariel House and will stay there when we return to Dublin!",5,2023,04,30
233,Disappointing,"After reading all the positive reviews, we were disappointed with our experience.  I agree that the breakfast was excellent and the staff welcoming and helpful. 
Our room however was tiny and needed a deep clean.  No welcoming water, no amenities in the bathroom, no place to put your toiletries in the bathroom other than the windowsill, and a shower arrangement that was awkward and uncomfortable.    I would not recommend this hotel. ",3,2023,04,29
233,Best value for money in Dublin and a brilliant time had by all. ,"I've just come home from spending the night with my sisters in Ariel house, it was my second time to have stayed here and I so looked forward to coming back. It did not disappoint again my sister's were so blown away by the Beautiful Decor of the very opulent hotel, the staff, the breakfast, the location and time he overall price it was such value for money.
I can't recommend Ariel House enough and I would just like to give Engin a mention, he was so so helpful and when we were leaving he was such a gentleman and helped us with our luggage to our car...
So thank you all to the wonderful staff at Ariel House we will be spreading the word about this little gem in beautiful Ballsbridge❤️
",5,2023,04,22
233,Great experience,"This was one of the Best experience se had with hotels and houses, and the dinner is so good! Try ""The Traditional"" If you are staying here!

Stayed for 1 night on business  and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! A fantastic location in Ballsbridge! Breakfast was 10/10 and you can see it was made with love :)

The rooms look like they were newly decorated and the color scheme across the house is just gorgeous! The staff were very sweet and I look forward to returning",5,2023,04,13
233,"Character, charm and excellent service","We have just enjoyed our second stay at Ariel House after a hiccup in our first stay that was absolutely put right on our second. A beautiful spacious family room and classic communal drawing room with honesty bar, which we did not get to use but have in other places and think it is a lovely service to offer. The hotel is undergoing refurbishment that is really setting it apart. Fantastic breakfast and good gluten free options for our child who has coeliac disease. We will use this hotel again and will recommend to many friends and family who stay in Dublin on annual visits home. It can be hard to find an authentic hotel experience with so many chains so grateful places like Ariel House are available! Thank you and well done to the staff: ",5,2023,04,11
233,Excellent,"A last minute booking - a friendly check in and got our room fairly quickly and while the description as a garden view is debatable, it was well appointed, clean  and comfortable and most importantly quiet. After a good nights sleep we tried the breakfast which was delicious and served by friendly staff
First time se have stayed and certainly won’t be the last",5,2023,04,04
233,Bonus extension to  our holiday ,"We had a most enjoyable stay, comfortable beds and everything one could ask for. We came direct from Dublin Airport and location is very good, walking distance from Ballsbridge. Breakfast is fantastic. Beautiful home baking and excellent presentation. A real Irish hospitality ethos. I will definitely return! ✅",5,2023,04,02
233,Charming and Convenient spot to stay,"They just remodel this adorable little bed and breakfast. So everything was new and fresh. 
They were very kind and helpful. The breakfast was great and the bed was cozy. The only complaint I would have is there was no ventilation or fan for fresh air so it was a little stuffy and warm but we were able to open them window. I really liked the location. We were literally step away from the train to central part of town so it made it easy to get back and forth. Also we had arrived in a car and they were very accommodating for parking it. ",5,2023,04,02
233,Great stay,"Lovely rooms, fantastic breakfast and very helpful staff. If I'm ever in Dublin again I wouldn't hesitate to book here. Very convenient for the 3arena. Picked as we were attending the c2c festival.   ",5,2023,03,17

233,Another amazing stay!!,"We have just had another amazing stay at Ariel House!
Staff were excellent, so warmly welcoming! The Manager leads by example, he couldn’t have done more to ensure we had A1 services!
The breakfast has to be had to fully appreciate how staying in Ariel House is sooooo popular!!",5,2023,02,28
233,Fantastic,"Everything has been perfect. Amazing breakfast, comfortable bed, nice place, friendly staff and very well connected with DART. I would recommend it, of course. It is also very quiet. We would repeat again.",5,2023,02,24
233,Simply the Best,"Stayed here recently for the Rugby game in Dublin. What an excellent place to stay. Room was amazing, location excellent, breakfast outstanding. Can't recommend Ariel House more highly. Simply the best place to stay in Dublin and can't wait to go back. ",5,2023,02,19
233,Helpful friendly staff and great service,"Ariel house is a little Gem in a beautiful central location. Friendly staff, rooms comfortable, clean, fresh.  Wonderful breakfast. I would come back again for that short city break. Great value in these times",5,2023,02,10
233,We are certain to be back,"We live on the West coast and have needed to stay in Dublin on many occasions over the years.We were going to 'Gifted' at the RDS in Ballsbridge. Ariel House turned out to be a perfect location.Just off the DART and a pleasant easy walk to the RDS and a restaurant later.Reception was extremely welcoming .our room was available early, so easy to leave our luggage.Don't know why we deserved it but our room was upgraded.Wonderfully quiet on the ground floor. Comfortable and warm.We had heard that breakfast was good.It did not disappoint!great selection and delicious.
Reception were very gracious and kept our luggage for us until we left for home in the afternoon,Thank you to all the staff who made our stay so welcoming and easy.",5,2023,01,12
233,A quality stay with great breakfast,"A lovely quiet stay in the heart of Dublin with car parking. The bedroom was comfortable and warm with a radiator we could adjust and a window that opened onto the garden. Bath and shower and a good range of channels on the TV
 But the highlight of the stay was the superb breakfast and the lovely staff. A fantastic array of juices, breads and pastries and a comprehensive menu of hot dishes. A cooked Irish breakfast was cooked beautifully, not at all greasy and presented well. We will definitely stay again. ",5,2023,01,11
233,Best B&B I've ever stayed at,"Ariel House is precisely what you would want in a B&B, the staff is WONDERFUL, the house has the coziest atmosphere ever and the complementary afternoon cake and coffee in the sitting room is superb. 

I've had the privilege to stay both in a double room as well as a junior suite and both rooms were amazing in their own way. 

The breakfast is to die for, honestly you cannot ask for better and the breakfast room is cozy and relaxing with attentive staff to help you with whatever you need. 

I've already booked our next stay for next December and cannot wait! I've recommended Ariel House to everyone I know and will continue to do so as long as they're open!

It is a quick walk to the nearest shop, bus 703 straight to the airport stops just down the road, there's excellent connections in the form of buses as well as the train just outside the door (otherwise it's a lovely 30min walk into town which I'd recommend for that daily exercise!

If you're planning to visit Dublin, you'd do yourself a favour staying here ❤️",5,2022,12,27
233,Never disappoints!,"Hadn’t stayed in Ariel House since just before Covid.  Last minute shopping trip to Dublin so decided in late November to avail of their ‘Black Friday’ sale. Stayed with a friend in a superior twin room on the lower ground floor. We arrived early around 12.30pm to a warm welcome from the guy in reception who informed us that our room was ready!  Room  was spacious yet warm & very comfortable, spotlessly clean & fresh.  I was delighted to see that the complimentary tea/coffee/cookies were still avail in their beautiful front drawing room. The breakfast the following morning was of the usual high standard, absolutely delicious . Delivered to our table by such wonderful hard working & courteous staff. Cannot wait to stay again……thank you!",5,2022,12,22
233,Exceptional,"Character, charm, warm helpful staff and the breakfast....oh the breakfast.  Ideal location to stroll to the city centre, enjoy the hospitality, and get the train back almost to the door.  If you want a stay that's about you, in a peaceful and relaxed atmosphere-Ariel House is your only choice",5,2022,12,19
233,Overnight stay,"We stayed at Ariel House for one night and will definitely be back. The location is excellent, staff were friendly and helpful, the accommodation was comfortable and cosy, it's a beautiful house and the breakfast was lovely. Couldn't fault anything. They had no problem with us dropping our bags early around 10:30 and checking in later after 22:00. A definite gem in Dublin",5,2022,12,13
233,Lovely quiet hotel,We stayed for a long weekend and really loved Ariel House. The receptionist gave a warm welcome and all were helpful when we had questions. The hotel was peaceful and conveniently located near the train station. Lots of options for breakfast too. Would definitely recommend,5,2022,11,28
233,Pleasant experience,"We spent 4 nights in this beautiful hotel. There are some signs of aging present in rooms, but it's clean, cozy and all premises of the hotel look classy and have undeniable historical Irish atmosphere, which was so uncommon and attractive for us. Especially we enjoyed stylish lounge and dining room.

Personnel is very warm and helpful.
Our room used to get very cold quickly when heating was off, probably because of bad insulation of windows (room of my parents didn't have this problem at all though). It wouldn't have been issue for us, if it weren't for our 7 months old kid. We were offered and electrical heater by front office workers right away and it worked just perfectly.

Ariel house is perfectly located in nice and calm area with Dart station few steps away - you can reach city center literally in minutes.

I'd definitely recommend this place for every visitor of Dublin.

233,Gorgeous,"Spent one night at Ariel House.  A beautiful old house. Everything was perfect.  Bed very comfortable, room warm and spotless. Free Wifi. Tea /Coffee making facilities.  A great choice at breakfast. We would definitely stay again.",5,2022,11,05
233,Brief overnight but top class,"Had a quick stay here for a family graduation  at Trinity. 
Great location, lovely room - we got an upgrade to junior suite which was fab---felt spoilt with space, size & comfort. 
 Very efficient & helpful staff, 
A warm & welcoming space--- 
Car park spaces limited, but street parkign is available - not sure if there is a cost for that.

Overall - highly recommend Ariel House, will be back as a Dublin stay.",5,2022,11,01
233,Ariel house,"What a little gem of a b&b, didn’t realise how close the dart was until we arrived! Aporox 2 mins walk away  Definitely an added bonus.  Clean & comfy rooms , lovely sitting room with tea /coffee facilities. Delicious breakfast. 
If you have the time whilst staying here catch the dart and go in the opposite direction and enjoy a couple of hrs at the seaside - we visited Bray, 30 mins in dart, relaxing chilled out trip walking along promenade. 
Breakfast is served 7-11 weekends & 7-10 weekdays, we were only informed of the weekend breakfast & on the Monday morning arrived for breakfast at 9.59 to be told breakfast was now finished, but on saying this , breakfast staff were very accommodating, we couldn’t order from menu but did bring us a pot of tea and some toast and we helped ourselves to cereal/ pastries 
Definitely recommend Ariel house for a b&b stay 
Excellent location also if you’re a rugby fan - Aviva stadium located next to dart station",5,2022,10,27
233,Comfortable stay with friendly staff,The room and facilities were comfortable. The bathroom and toilet were a bit of a squeeze. The toile was close to the hot towel rail. Otherwise very welcoming. Would definitely recommend to friends and family.,4,2022,10,22
233,Very Well Situated,"Withing 2 minutes walk of the DART line, this wee hotel is ideally situated for a visit to Dublin. Dublin, itself,  is horrendously expensive by Brisish standards but this hotel does offer reasonable value for money. Breakfasts were fine and the staff reasonably helpful. Free parking is a bonus in any city hotel thise days. We would use it again next time in Dublin.",4,2022,10,17
233,Beautiful Place,This was just a one night stop for me to conclude my one week stay in Ireland.  Very nice.  Modern amenities in a classic setting.  The neighborhood is quiet yet you are still close to the sites you will likely want to see in Dublin.  Staff was very nice and helpful.,5,2022,10,12
233,Timeless elegance,"We returned to the Ariel House 13 years after our first visit.  It was lovely then, and it is lovely today.  In fact, it does not seem to have changed at all.  We highly recommend the location, as Ballsbridge is a charming, convenient and quiet neighborhood.  We hope that we don't wait another 13 years to return!",5,2022,10,12
233,Highly recommend,We loved our stay in Ariel house. The room was gorgeous and very spacious with a lovely bay window. The staff were all very welcoming and the breakfast was excellent. Great location also. We would highly recommend it and will return again. Thank you,5,2022,10,10
233,Ms,"We spent three relaxed days at Ariel House. It was great to return to a clean and comfortable room after a long sightseeing day.
We could relax and watch television in the lovely living room as if we were at home. The king bed was super comfortable and invited to a luxurious sleep.
The view to the calm Lansdowne road was lovely. Very roomy bathroom with tub and shower.
Delicious breakfast with lots of choices and additional menu choice in a lovely winter garden.
Will return any time!",5,2022,10,05
233,Lovely B&B,"I have stayed many times in Ariel House. The location is great for the city centre. The rooms are large, beautifully appointed and always clean. The breakfest is homemade and delicious. The homemade cake and tea in the lounge, an added treat. I will continue to stay at Ariel House, while visiting Dublin.",5,2022,10,05
233,lovely,"a beautiful experience.  All staff were helpful and welcoming.  Great recommendations from the staff on what to see and do.  Lovely area and very easy to get to the city.  The bed was really comfortable including the pillows (of which I'm hard to please).
The breakfast was amazing.",5,2022,10,02
233,Wonderful hotel.,"This hotel offers excellent service in every way.
If I visit Dublin again, I will stay at this hotel without hesitation.

Especially breakfast is excellent.
Breakfast has many choices and tastes very good.

The staff are very kind and make us feel comfortable.

Amenities are also good.
This hotel provides us with tissue paper and hair conditioner.
I found it very convenient.

Rooms are spacious enough and clean.
I also like the design and layout of the furniture.
If there is only one point to improve, it would be more convenient if there was a refrigerator in the room.

If I visit Dublin again, I will stay at this hotel.",5,2022,09,28
233,Nicest Guest House in Ballsbridge,"I've stayed in Ariel House many times over the years and it is always a lovely experience, comfortable rooms, obliging staff and fabulous breakfasts. I stayed recently for three nights, travelling for work and booked well in advance so got a very reasonable rate. It is very conveniently located, close to the Dart, an ideal base for work or pleasure.",5,2022,09,26
233,Ideally situated,"Very helpful in reception.  Directed us to a good restaurant area about 10 minutes walk away. A pleasant 20 minute walk from a hop on hop off bus stop and ideal for the Aviva Stadium. Irish breakfast excellent and well cooked (Rose??) Ok the room wasn’t luxurious but clean and if you are on a tight schedule and want somewhere convenient to sleep, this fits the bill. Off street free parking is a bonus.",4,2022,09,26
233,20 minutes morning walk down to the beach!,"Beautifully decorated hotel with nice lounge, friendly staff quick to help. Our only negative comment is the description of our room as having a 'garden view'. This turned out to be a view mostly of buildings and just a sad, stony courtyard with little vegetation. Not at all attractive. One other point is that we were advised to hold onto the railing when going up or down the steep steps to the entrance - difficult when there are large flower pots in the way!",4,2022,09,22
233,High expectations not met,"Our check in experience was great, very welcoming at Reception and information given about parking and breakfast times etc. 

When we arrived into our room, straight away I was disappointed as it did not resemble any photographs of the rooms advertised on the website. I assume we were in a Garden View room, but the view was of the back yard which was weeds and concrete slabs and also overlooked so I could see into the buildings at the back. 
The room was small, dark, tired and I was shocked to see how dusty the headboard was, this wasn't just missed at the last clean, it hadn't been cleaned in quite some time. The room really does need a freshen up with paint, new furniture and new carpet. TV was very small but a good enough selection of channels.  Bathroom was ok, cleaner than the bedroom was. 

The website stated tea, coffee and homemade cakes/buns were available in the lounge. Coffee machine was a nice touch, but instructions on how to use it would be helpful. There were no cakes or buns there, no breakfast tea and no clean glasses for the water. 

I thought not all would be lost as according to other reviews, breakfast here was amazing.  Unfortunately this wasn't our experience. We were seated and asked did we want tea/coffee. In other Hotels, usually the set up of the breakfast is explained i.e. self service/menu. There was a table with bowls, jugs and breads/pastries, so I assumed that it was self service, but was waiting to be told. I then found a menu tucked behind the salt and pepper and had started to read it when we were asked what we would like to order, we had only been seated for less than 5 minutes and weren't directed to any menu so I had to say no I wasn't ready yet. We ordered the Irish breakfast, I had high hopes about it but it was small and unfortunately I didn't enjoy it. The brown toast is not brown toast, it's toasted wheaten bread. 
Another let down at breakfast was the servers. Although pleasant, it's extremely off-putting to have them standing in a group on the step beside your table, practically on top of your shoulder, talking amongst one another. I actually moved my chair over abit as one of the staffs hips were almost touching my shoulder. The dining room isn't big and it's really not appropriate or professional. We weren't offered sauces and to be honest, I didn't want to disrupt their conversations to ask for some. 

When we were leaving, a taxi had parked up the middle of the parking area, blocking us in, so we had to ask at reception was it someone here as we are blocked in. Thankfully it was, it was a staff member, no apology or acknowledgement from the staff member when they were moving their car out. Not an ideal situation, I understand parking in the area isn't readily available, but it's little things like this that aren't professional.

I think this Hotel was a gem once upon a time, but really needs a refurb in order to justify the prices they are charging. Please also update the photographs on the website to reflect all of the rooms. 

I can only give 2 stars, 1 for location as it's a nice walk into the dock area and beside the Aviva Stadium, and 1 for our check on experience. ",2,2022,09,13
233,Great hotel,"We stayed here for my 50th birthday.Such a lovely hotel.
We arrived early in the morning and after emailing about leaving our luggage there whilst we went off to explore before our check in we did so and came back at nearly check in time.The quiet room was nice and had cake tea/coffee and water if you wanted it We all fell asleep and they didn't want to wake us to tell us our room was ready!!
We had asked if they could order a taxi to take us to the theatre where we were going to see Riverdance and they we happy to do so.
When we went down for breakfast the next morning there was a bit of a queue so we had to wait in the lounge room along with a few others.The restaurant is small but we weren't told there might be a backlog and a wait 
We were seated and had a lovely breakfast.
The next morning was my birthday and little did i know that my parents had been emailing the hotel & asked to put some decorations on the table along with a bottle of champagne & they were very happy to oblige.
What none of us knew is that there were going to sing happy birthday and bring some homemade cakes out for us.Such a lovely touch.
The rooms are lovely and clean and spacious with a very comfortable bed.
It's a nice walk up to a couple of pubs and restaurants and there's a train station 5min walk away to take you into town where the Jameson factory is.
We had already booked a taxi to the airport but he got stuck in traffic.We asked could they book us 1 and it was dine straight away and with us within minutes.
We would definitely stay here again.Great location,froendly staff and lovely room.
Thankyou again to all the team for making my birthday extra special.We loved Dublin.",5,2022,08,19
233,Recommended!,"Beautiful, comfortable hotel in a great, quiet but lively part of town. If I find myself in Dublin again, I will definitely stay at Ariel House! The staff was caring and breakfast was delicious and served in a lovely dining room.",5,2022,08,17
233,Lovely place with great staff and breakfasts,"Lovely hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast was amazingly good - highly recommended with lovely views.

Only things letting the place down are lack of parking when busy but staff do their best to accomodate people.

Pricey but that's Dublin for you.",4,2022,07,12
233,Excellent B&B,"Ariel House is an absolutely lovely B&B, all of the staff were so friendly and helpful. It is also in an excellent location with it being less than 5 minutes away from the DART train station and the Aviva Stadium. This was perfect for us as we were going to a concert in the Aviva Stadium and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. The room we stayed in was really nice and we had an excellent quality breakfast with lots of selection in the morning. I would recommend Ariel House to anyone and I would definitely stay here again when I'm in Dublin.",5,2022,07,11
233,Fantastic B&B,"So pleased that we came across the Ariel House B&B when we were looking for accommodation in Dublin. We were going to a concert at the Aviva Stadium and the location couldn't be more perfect. Literally on the doorstep and a stones throw from Lansdowne Road Dart stop. The B&B was lovely, room was clean and spacious and the staff were friendly. There was plenty of selection for breakfast and the food was excellent. Would definitely stay here again and would recommend to others!",5,2022,07,09
233,Superior experience,"This guest house is absolutely lovely. The breakfasts are fabulous with lots of different selections sure to appeal to most travelers. Our room was a suite with a very spacious sitting area, large bathtub and shower. There’s a wonderful drawing room on the main floor where guests can sit and relax. Hot drinks, lemon water and small tea cakes are made available in drawing room for guests in the afternoon. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The guest house is located next to the stadium and very close to a Intercity train station. While it did not happen when we stayed there, this area of town could be busy and noisy during concerts, games and other stadium events.otherwise the neighborhood is very nice, several decent restaurants and pubs are within walking distance.",5,2022,07,07
233,Ariel House,"This is a little gem. Stayed here this weekend it was fabulous. The staff are so good and the food delicious.  Will definitely be back.  It’s so convenient as dart is only a few steps away , step off at the Lansdowne road station.!",5,2022,06,27
233,"Lovely, Quiet Stay","This place is very clean, so warm and welcoming, the breakfast is incredible (unbeatable really), and the staff are incredible. Absolutely loved our stay and highly recommend if you want somewhere quiet and easy going to stay but that's right next to the public transit! We were a block away from the DART. Absolutely perfect location.",5,2022,06,13
233,Very pleasant stay,"The location is conveniently located to the train station and walking distance to the city center. The staff was very helpful and went out of their way to accommodate our needs. The breakfast is excellent. The building is not new, but has a lot of charm. We would definitely stay there again.",5,2022,06,08
233,A week's stay.,"Ask for a 'garden room'.  My husband and I stayed in a smaller room with a queen-size bed.  The room with attached bath was extremely clean.  The housekeeping staff are excellent and very friendly and accommodating for anything we needed (ice bucket, etc).  Breakfast was fantastic! Besides the fresh fruit and pastry, there's yogurt, juices, coffee and tea and then you have your choice of poached eggs, pancakes, oatmeal, etc. The staff in the dining room was fantastic.  12 Euros

As a side note: we brought our laundry to a little place around the corner for 

There are no elevators in this hotel so you must be able to climb stairs.  There is no air conditioning (which could just be a North American thing). There are no wash/face cloths (again this may be a North American thing).

We would definitely go back to this place again but not after mid May as it was quite warm! Definitely recommend this place for that friendly and clean atmosphere.  

Depending on time of day cabs to City Centre run between 9-15 Euros or a 40 minute walk.",4,2022,06,04
233,Lots of stairs ,"Arriving you have to climb steep stairs. Depending where your room is,  more very tight stairs. Room was quite small. Beds comfortable. Missing tissues. Staff helpful and friendly. Breakfast good choices and tasty. Overall if you don't have big expectations it's convenient close to dart and bus connections into city. ",3,2022,06,03
233,First visit to Dublin,"Close to the railway station, but not disturbed in any way by the trains. 
Clean rooms, very kind staff and excellent breakfast. 
The car was save in the parking ground just in front of the building. 
Some problems with the plumbing, but we enjoyed our stay!",5,2022,06,01
233,Great Boutique Guest House in Dublin,"Front desk experience was exemplary. Marija gave me first class welcome & went the extra mile to find a dinner delivery. Room was spacious & comfortable. It was quiet to the outside but if you don't want someone walking overhead, get an upper floor. Breakfast was made to order and good. Limited free parking in front. Beautiful common areas and garden.",5,2022,05,31
233,Great place to stay,"Our room was lovely, clean and bright.  Very close to the light rail system and it was easy to get the rail into City Centre.   The staff was helpful.  There are several good places to eat within walking distance.  Breakfast was delicious.",5,2022,05,31
233,Wonderful Place to Stay,"The room was very comfortable, and staying in Ballsbridge is great (so many restaurants nearby) .  It's walking distance to the center of Dublin.  The staff was very helpful and they warned my that the Dublin airport was very crowed and I should go  early.    The breakfast, with is included, is wonderful!   Afternoon tea and cakes were also included.   I loved my stay at Ariel House, and hope to visit next year.",5,2022,05,26
233,Great place to stay,"We had a great stay at Ariel House. The service was great, rooms were clean and breakfast of a good quality. It is in a great location in Dublin which was very helpful. It is an older house so things are a bit worn but otherwise all was good for our family.",5,2022,05,26
233,Delightful~!,"We stayed at Ariel House at both ends of our trip; the staff is very friendly and so helpful. We needed assistance on locating a Covid testing site before traveling back to the US, and staff was instrumental in helping us. Our room(s) we very comfortable, and the breakfast was the best we enjoyed during our trip.",5,2022,05,24
233,Excellent!,"Ariel House could not have made our stay in Dublin any better. Convenient to the city center via DART and located in a quiet suburban area. Our room was spacious and very comfortable. The breakfast was fabulous! Excellent selection from the menu and everything thing was scrumptious. The staff, breakfast room as well as reception, were gracious and very helpful getting us oriented to the area. We will definitely come back here on our next trip to Dublin!",5,2022,05,18
233,"Warm, relaxing, atmosphere","Nice area. Excellent Breakfast. Nice staff.  Close to Herbert Park and nice Bistros.
Food Market nearby with local producs.
Walking distance to 3 Arena by the lovely river Dodder. 
Easy access to Dublin city by bus, taxi or DART (train)",4,2022,05,18
233,Wonderful stay at Ariel House,"The room was very comfortable and the staff were very good. 

Breakfasts were delicious, and the location near the Dart station was ideal. 

Ariel House is within easy walking distance to great pubs and restaurants as well as shopping.",5,2022,04,25
233,Excellent Friendly Atmosphere.  Great Facilities,This is a real gem and a very popular venue.  Do book if you can get a reservation.  Beautiful Drawing Room with afternoon tea and cakes included.  Fantastic rooms. Great breakfast and very professional staff.,5,2022,04,24
233,Great value - Good location - very comfortable stay.,We stayed one night to attend a concert at Board Gais - car parking is a real benefit and the 20 minute walk to the venue wasnt a problem. The room was very clean and comfortable - tea and coffee making facilities. The house itself is a lovely Georgian building with some really beautiful pieces of furniture in the common areas. Our room  had a Garden View - which was the back of another property - not very scenic - but that didnt matter to us and for the price - we were not going to complain - but it would be an issue for another customer! Breakfast was good - cooked  fresh with a really good selection of fruit - cereals and cooked breakfast . Despite the usual breakfast rush around 9am the staff on duty handled it really well and the serving staff were young - helpful - bright and pleasant. This is a very well priced B+B in a good location.,4,2022,04,21
233,lovely B&B in an old georgian house with a gourgeous breakfast,"We enjoyed our 2nd stay in this beautiful B&B in a great area in Dublin: close to the canal, close to docklands and not far from the city centre. The breakfast is phantastic - and so are the people working there. We had a spacious room. The only critic I have: apparently there was no regular room service during a longer stay which meant beds not made, no cleaning of the room. Only on special request the room would be cleanded.",4,2022,04,20
233,Perfect stay at Ariel House,"We booked Ariel House for 20th March to attend the Ireland/ Scotland rugby match, having stayed here a number of times before.

As previously, the staff were very helpful, the bedroom and hotel very clean and the breakfast was high quality and plentiful.",5,2022,03,22
233,Impeccable Service and Great Breakfast,"We had a large room at the back of the house, so very quiet, recently redecorated and well furnished with plenty of storage.   Both Jennie, the owner, and the staff were all friendly and very well organised.  They were happy to help with any requests we had, in fact I'm not sure I've ever met such a great group of staff.
Breakfasts were substantial and excellently cooked.  There was tea and coffee in the drawing room, together with cake, all through the afternoon.  It was a comfortable and peaceful spot.
Ariel House is near a Dart station, so easy to get into the main Conolly station and on from there, though taxis into the centre are reasonably priced.  The reception will have one with you in minutes.",5,2022,03,22
233,A very pleasent accomodation!,"A very nice irish hotel.
We enjoyed the attention of the personnel, in reception and in the breakfast serving room.
The room is very large and clean with carpet on the floors - very silent. The hotel offers all info requiered before the trip and even if we arrived late in the night they received us perfectly.
A very good breakfast with local irish products, with order from the menu, included in the price.
Location near Aviva stadion, quick acces by the bus network and train. Very easy to travel inside town with local card-10 euro/24 hours. Same card is used for bus, tram and train and is very easy to travel to interest points in the town.",5,2022,03,15
233,The best guest experience,"I arrived at Ariel House last 14th of February to stay for a week, but I had  to live 3 days earlier due to a personal problem. PAUL in reception was very gentle and profesional since the very beginning, helping no matter what. The first morning, I was happy surprised with a fantastic Á la Carte breakfast plus buffet, where ADELE and FFERNANDO gave me an excellent service and confort. I had some personal problems and MARCO, the Manager and Paul were not only professionals, but empathetic making my experience more bearable. It is an incredible TEAM, in a cozy and great special hotel. I will recommend it 100%.I am very greatful for what they did and I hope to return.",5,2022,02,27
233,Theatre Visit,"We stayed at Ariel House on a recent family break in Dublin - our main activity was a night at the Bord Gais Energy Theatre _ Ariel House was just a short walk from the theatre an excellent location 
The rooms were excellent - very cozy and warm given our trip was in February and the breakfast was exceptional 
We will definitely stay in Ariel House in the future.",5,2022,02,21
233,Perfect as always,"We have stayed at Ariel house many times and every time we have a great experience, usually we visit as a couple but this time we had our young baby with us, which we thought may be tricky as we hadn't been away with a 10 month old before, but the staff could not have been nicer or more accommodating from the moment we arrived. Nothing was too much trouble. The room was beautiful and really spacious, the breakfast was exceptional as always -  a highlight when we stay. The added touch of the biscuits and cakes in the main room in the afternoon is just great. We really would never stay anywhere else when coming to Dublin. So would definitely recommend you stay here.",5,2022,02,17
233,Great stay at Ariel House,"Super welcome and very helpful and friendly staff. One of the best breakfasts ever. 

So handy to the Aviva for the Rugby too. Would definitely stay again. 

Booking was easy through the website and there was parking available when we arrived which was good as the roads were to be closed the next day for the rugby match.",5,2022,02,08
233,Ariel House - Dublin,"It is a small, cozy hotel in a nice part of Dublin. It is very easy to reach the center on foot or by bus. 
The staff is very nice and attentive. At breakfast we would have liked to have fruit and fresh vegetables, like tomatoes and cucumbers.",4,2022,02,02
233,Another fabulous stay at Ariel House,"We have had a weekend at Ariel House every year since 2010. We don’t stay anywhere else in Dublin. We have been there in every season of the year. We especially like staying at Halloween and in December when the hotel is beautifully decorated. We have just had a summer break at the hotel. I felt very safe with the Covid measures taken. Breakfast, staff and service as excellent as ever. Highly recommended. Keep up the good work.",5,2020,09,05
233,Deirdre,"I had a very relaxing stay with friends at Ariel house. Every aspect was wonderful,clean and comfortable room,parking onsite, gracious welcome,all covid-19 protocols in place and to top it all a most delicious breakfast.It was my fifth occasion to stay here and why I brought my friends to experience proper Irish hospitality at the highest level. Great location too.",5,2020,08,22
233,"Beautiful, quiet & friendly staff!","We have stayed here twice, the first time in a double room with my husband, we enjoyed it so much we brought the kids the next time and stayed in the family room.  The rooms are beautifully decorated, spacious and surprisingly quiet for Dublin.  The staff are lovely, very warm and friendly, especially Natalie.  The breakfast is really nice with such  a choice.  Ariel House has such a nice personal feel to it, much more homely than a large chain of hotels.",5,2020,08,16
233,Amazing Victorian House,"I myself get confused the odd time thinking a guesthouse is like a B&B. Definitely not this little gem in Ballsbridge. Back in Dublin to visit family and stayed here with my sister. It’s a hotel on a smaller scale with personal touches. From when I asked for more milk and got home baked biscuits too😊The house is immaculately clean, staff are possibly the most helpful I’ve come across in Dublin hotels without being overpowering. From the management ladies at reception, to the night porter to the cleaner. Well done on the Covid procedures, access to sanitiser everywhere, a mask was available when I asked and room was spotless. Truly a wonderful place in a stunning location.",5,2020,08,12
233,Excellent Breakfast!,"We had originally booked a double room with the garden view, however got upgraded to a lovely triple room. The decor was lovely and every bit of the room spotless.  The staff was friendly and attentive, in particular Niamh. The breakfast was excellent, really!  We tried almost every option on the breakfast menu during our stay the quality was great and needless to say very delicious. The breakfast room was very clean and very comfortable. We chose Ariel House since it was walking distance to Sandymount Beach. Very close to many restaurants and the DART. It was a great experience altogether. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2020,08,12
233,Desperately seeking a reason why I booked this place,"Where to start..no lift (mother had to haul up stairs), horrible room, beds were hard, chair in room was uncomfortable, tired dated upholstery, plastic milks were when incorporated into the tea went lumpy, horrible shower, limited movement in the bathroom, no where to sit outside, breakfast was shocking ( scones that resembled soufflés that lost their way) soda bread that wasn’t soda bread, banana bread with no flavor of banana, pancakes that tasted like bad fry bread, with a concoction of streaky bacon that could be wrung out with the amount of grease. I got no sleep. Dart going all night, noisy guests banging doors, creaking floors, screaming kids. Definitely not suitable for older guests..",1,2020,08,08
233,"Very well appointed, comfortable and classical style beautiful hotel","Ariel Hotel was amazing; set in a large Victorian building with very large rooms with high ceilings; beautiful rich furnishing; very comfortable and very big bed; spotlessly clean.
Very quiet, the metro (DART) on the door step, only 3 stops from the city centre; 
Great breakfasts, very quickly served, with much variety; very attentive staff.
Great place.",5,2020,03,14
233,Unforgettable stay!,"We were at the hotel for one night only, for our honeymoon and it was very special. The staff were very attentive, kind and helpful. The room was well kept and very comfortable. We had an extra surprise with a lovely handwritten message and a selection of cakes and biscuits to celebrate our special occasion. Their breakfast is amazingly well served and of high quality.",5,2020,02,25
233,Coin fare,"Very well situated hotel for RDS and Aviva Stadiums in residential area with lovely restaurants nearby.

Very comfortable hotel of Victorian character. Very nicely furnished both in main areas and bedrooms.

Spotlessly clean and good range of toiletries in bathroom.

Breakfast was excellent. Good choice of fruit juice, cereals and breads. Lovely choice of cooked breakfast with local produce and freshly prepared.

I would highly recommend this hotel and look forward to another visit.

",4,2020,02,22
233,The worst place I've ever stayed in my whole life,"We stayed here after attending a concert in the RDS. It was a present for my partner. We normally stay in another hotel which is excellent but it was booked out.

We got here and when we checked into our room I was so disappointed as it was disgusting and dirty. My partner just wanted to forget about it and head to the concer as we were late getting up to Dublin. 

Do I just left it the stupidest thing I ever did. We came back after the event and I got a shower and went to bed. I woke up the next morning and was brushing my hair and whay was stuck in it only chewing gum that had been stuck on the second pillow after i had taken the first pillow off during the night. 

I started bawling crying ad I now was in a disgusting dive and had some one else's gum in my hair.i could even see the where the crusty gum had been stuck to the pillow.

We went down to reception  where the manager is who is the most ignorant person ever. She even offered to cut it out of my hair!!!!!! My partner suggested could a hairdresser be booked instead of it being cut out. She then booked the hairdresser and told us to go to breakfast. 

We were waiting for breakfast where the man who gave you your table kept on skipping over us. I couldn't eat anyway knowing someone's dirty gum was stuck in my hair.

We went to hairdressers who were brilliant and got the gum out of my hair. I still lost hair over this.

We got back to Ariel House and she asked us how I got on and I told her it was now gone. She then offered us a complimentary nights stay over what had happened we declined as I never wanted to step foot in that dirty place again. We asked for our money back and she DECLINED!!!!! said that she didn't believe it happened on their premises and basically accused me of practically putting the gum in my hair myself.

We went through booking.com and they refunded our money as they were appalled at what happened. 

After reading other people's bad reviews of this place she will just spin it her own way to make the reviewer look like a liar. She is the most horrible person I have ever dealt with in relation to accomadation and the premises is dirty.

On the way walking out of the place what did we notice only a woman who cleans the room chewing gum. 

Our whole trip was ruined we were suppose to attend another event the next day but I was just too upset and wanted to go home and wash my hair again.",1,2020,02,22
233,Good place to stay overall.,"We stayed here as a couple, the only complain I have is that the double bed was actually 2 mattress joined together and the gap between them made us uncomfortable, further more the duvet actually had 2 parts as well 1 in top and the other at bottom. The bottom part somehow came out of the cover in the middle of the night and it was cold after that. Otherwise breakfast is good and place is quite and peaceful.",4,2020,02,20
233,Fab -u-lous,"What a great place to stay, splendid cosy and comfortable. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff.
Huge selection for breakfast, something for every taste. Great location, comfy beds, nice bathroom.",5,2020,02,10
233,Ireland 🇮🇪 V’s Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Aviva Stadium ,"What can I say, every opportunity we can get we book with Ariel House. Excellent customer service, superb breakfast , can never fault.
Thank you for making another memorable weekend so special .
Breakfast is a must , made to order and fresh coffee on tap! Thank you , hope to see you all again soon 👍🏻💕🥂",5,2020,02,02
233,Poor response to guest reacting to Glutened,"After breakfast it very quickly became evident that my wife had been glutened & my wife is a celiac (allergic to gluten). It destroyed the whole day as we were attending my daughters graduation. Ariel house were ill equipped to deal with the problem, telling me it was not possible that my wife was glutened by their kitchen as they were so careful. Accidents happen in kitchens how you handle them is a measure of your hospitality not denying responsibility. I have stayed at Ariel house a number of times but it’s lost it’s charm for me.",1,2020,01,18
233,Very welcome,"We went to passs a night in Dublin because my family arrived at the Dublin airport.
We sleep all together in a really big room with to doubles beds. The decoration was lovely, the shower was really good and the beds/duvets awesome!. 

When we arrive the temperature of the room was too hot and the windows were closed with lockers. They didn't put any objection and they open for us the windows. The staff is really amazing so fiendly and so professional.

Breakfast is BEAUTIFUL. My family from Spain enjoied the first full irishand they loved it!!

I highly recommend Ariel House to everybody.",5,2020,01,06
233,"Ariel House, Definitely a Winner","A boutique hotel, friendly and helpful staff, lovely breakfast.  I really liked the location, out of the city centre but easily reachable by train or by walking.  Dublin was great, and definitely a place I would stay in again.  No negatives.
",5,2019,12,22
233,Business Overnight,"I have used this hotel on a number of occasions for over night before a meeting. The rooms are very comfortable and clean, the food is exceptional and the staff are very pleasant and professional. I would strongly advise anyone to stay here. There are transport links on its doorstep but parking may be limited. The Wifi is good also.",5,2019,12,14
233,Timeless elegance,Loved everything about my stay. The friendly staff make you feel so at home. The facilities are great ..comfy bed and excellent shower. The decor is so elegant and the complimentary evening tea in such a gorgeous dining room is so thoughtful.  Breakfast is one of the best I ever had. Fresh and prompt. Well done. This place is a gem. Thank you!,5,2019,12,04
233,A little gem,"Enjoyed a happy long weekend here, in a very friendly hotel. Rooms were excellent with comfortable beds, good storage facilities and a good bathroom. 
Breakfast was excellent - plenty of choice for buffet style and home cooked options. Allergens were clearly marked. Staff were attentive and friendly and kept the buffet well stocked at all times. 
There is a large lounge with tea/coffee making facilities and home baked cake or biscuits which you help yourself to. 
We loved our stay here and could choose whether to walk into the city centre or use the train, as the station was a 2 minute walk away. 
Be aware that it is very close to the Aviva Stadium. If there is a match there the roads around are closed to traffic.

",5,2019,11,14
233,Beaut of a place ,"We stayed here for three nights as we were participating in the Dublin Marathon. 
We stayed in a basement room which was spacious and exceptionally clean. 
The guest house is a beautiful Victorian building. 
Tea and coffee  with biscuits were provided on the room along with toiletries in the bathroom. A bath was a must post marathon! 
The staff were friendly and helpful at all times throughout our stay. 
At breakfast there was a variety of foods to choose from. Along with cereals and fruit and yoghurt. Throughout the afternoon tea and coffee were complimentary in the lounge area which was a very relaxing place. 
Situated only a 20min walk from Dublin City it’s the perfect place to stay for a city break. 👌🏽
",5,2019,10,28
233,"nice hotel, friendly and pleasant service at the reception.","Absolutely ok for one night. Rooms were clean, but would need a refurbishing. The smell in the bathroom wasn't very nice. The double bed was too small to use it with two people but there was an extra bed in the room. Mattresses seem quite old and not very comfortable. Good located, easy to reach Dublin City by train. Nice breakfast! ",4,2019,10,28
233,Excellent stay,"We booked at Ariel House for a 3 night mini break. We arrived very early as it was so easy to get to from the airport...literally a 10 minute walk from the Aircoach drops you off. Endless coffee/tea and cakes are available in the lounge which are complimentary for the guests. We were shown to our room which certainly exceeded our expectations. A huge bed which was extremely comfortable and a separate bath and shower in the bathroom offered plenty of room. There may be a wait for breakfast as the dining room can’t cater for lots of people turning up at popular times but the wait is only short in the lounge....again with coffee available. The service for breakfast was very good and the food was very tasty and plentiful. The staff throughout are attentive and always eager to help and made the stay very enjoyable. The Dart train system is a 2min walk so easy to get into the city to tour around. If, and that’s a big if, I had to complain or be thrown in the old Dublin gaol, then I would point out that there are steps to encounter. A good few to get in the building and then more, depending on where your room is situated. This WAS pointed out prior to booking so it wasn’t a surprise and hey!, it’s a Victorian house so it’s part of the character. It’s a shame some negative reports have been written but I guess you can’t please all the people all the time. We had a wonderful, quiet, comfortable time at Ariel House and would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone. Thank you everyone for making our Anniversary special. ",5,2019,10,21
233,A wonderful stay,We stayed for 2 nights at the beginning of our 2 week trip. This was our third time staying here and each visit has been wonderful. Denise and all the staff were very helpful and understanding.... we had a small incident that was NOT the fault of Ariel House and they were very understanding and patient with me. Breakfast was tasty and a nice way to start the day. The location is only a mile and half to city center and easily walkable.,5,2019,10,12
233,Great location with friendly and helpful staff,"We loved the convenience of having the train so close. Had no problem with parking and while the room's decor was a little old-fashioned but we found our two night stay comfortable and we both slept well. 
Having travelled from the USA on a 4 week trip this was our first stop and the receptionist switched our rooms to the ground floor have noticed out large suitcases.
Very satisfied with Ariel House",5,2019,10,01
233,"Good location, friendly helpful staff excellent breakfast",We thoroughly enjoyed our recent 3 night stay at Ariel House. We had no problem finding a space in the car park and the Dart station was so close and convenient to use to access the city we didn’t need to move it during our stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful although the decor of the room was a little tired it was spacious and clean. The breakfast was exceptionally good and I would definitely recommend the pancakes.,4,2019,09,29
233,"Good location, value and service","My wife and I stayed at Ariel House for 5 nights in September. I felt it was a very good accommodation at a reasonable price, given that Dublin can be expensive. The staff was very helpful when I made my original reservation and even more helpful when our traveling companions needed to change their reservation several times. Native checked us in on the day of arrival. We got in around 9:30 AM and she offered us breakfast and by the time we were done our room was ready. I know they can’t guarantee this but it worked very well for us. We requested a room on the first floor overlooking the garden in the back. It was very spacious, comfortable and quiet It is a bit outside the city center in a reasonably quiet neighborhood. The DART train is right on the corner and provides easy access into the city center or places North and South of the city. We were able to use the train to go to Malahide Castle, the Howth cliff walk, and Dun Loughaire, Bray and Greystines. All of which were nice places to visit outside the city. A LEAP card pass lets you use the DART, LUAS, and buses for transport. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance of Ariel. We really liked Juniors in Beggars Bush about a 10 minute walk. Sandy mount village is about a 20 minute walk. It has a lot of nice restaurants and shops and around the corner is a promenade and strand along the beach. Overall, We were very pleased.",5,2019,09,27
233,Enjoyed our stay,"I see that there are a number of mixed reviews.  Although I acknowledge the concern about numerous steps and the small parking lot, we had a wonderful stay.  Ariel House is close to the train station and it was very easy to ride into the city.  The staff were all very accommodating and polite to us, even when it was very hectic on the Saturday morning that we arrived and asked to leave our luggage until check-in later in the day.  Rooms were large and clean and we slept soundly. I would happily stay there again.  ",5,2019,09,23
233,Not worth the money,"The price for a room looking how it did with such bad quality is outrageous

Parking was busy and tight spaces. 

The room was tired, stained sheets, carpet and the shower looked dirty. Not at all what I would expect from a four star hotel. 

At breakfast we had to wait for a table which is understandable if everyone comes at once however when finally seated we were not offered tea or coffee and had to ask to order after 25 minutes. 

I tried contacting management for an explanation but I guess they couldn't be bothered. 

I would not recommend this hotel. ",1,2019,09,23
233,Gem,"Couldn’t fault Ariel House as a place to stay over in Dublin.
It has private parking, is well located, near Aviva Stadium and Grand Canal.
The staff are friendly, the house is beautiful, the rooms are quite large, clean and comfortable. Lovely fresh cooked breakfast and complimentary tea/ coffee , little cakes in the afternoon.
Would recommend.",5,2019,09,21
233,Not exactly as expected,"because of the glorious ratings I decided to book a couple of nights here while in Dublin. Must say all staff were incredibly helpful.  The hotel itself looked interesting from outside. (Note, stairs to front door and more stairs inside - no lift). Regarding the interior - carpets could use a good cleaning and the furniture in the living room/lounge and guest lroom could use a good facelift - very worn. Bathroom was really tight. Linens clean and crisp. Bed comfortable. Breakfast very good with a wide selection. 
Location  (south of the river ) was perfect since the DART (commuter train) was within 50 feet of hotel.  This made easy access into downtown Dublin. We also traveled to the little village of Howth on the DART - well worth the trip.
I would recommend this hotel but a little drab in furnishings.",4,2019,09,15
233,Does not live up to reviews,"We were disappointed with our stay at Ariel House. Our room had a large window next to parked cars which was not the outlook we had hoped for. No nets for privacy. The bathroom was basic and needed updating. The breakfast which was the main reason I selected this hotel, and paid the room rate, was mediocre. Cooked breakfast no more than satisfactory. Baked goods were of poor quality. The dining room very cramped. If breakfast is important to you, go elsewhere. You can get better value for money than Ariel House offers in the summer months. Location next to Lansdowne Road station is good. Car parking good for small number of cars.",3,2019,09,13
233,Fabulous,"We were visiting Dublin for my wife's birthday in August and had the pleasure of staying at Ariel House. The customer service was exceptional and we were well looked after throughout our week long stay. Our suite overlooked a quiet tree lined street and was decorated with lovely antiques especially the comfortable four poster canopy bed. Breakfast was delicious and staff were polite and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. It's a two minute walk to the train that takes you into downtown, only 10 minutes away. It was nice to spend the day in town and evenings at Temple Bar and then escape the hustle and bustle by returning to the calming quiet of Ariel House. It was a fabulous stay and we have every intention of staying at Ariel House during our next visit to Dublin. Thanks to GM Natalie Smith for personally ensuring that our stay was all that we had hoped it would be. Cheers.",5,2019,09,10
233,Convenient to the City Center with True Irish Hospitality,"We have stayed at the Ariel House several times due to its hospitality, affordability, and easy access to Dublin proper and the airport.  The staff is excellent in making your stay most comfortable, arranging rides, restaurant reservations and making sure your needs are met.  I recommend reserving the junior suite on the main floor.  It is sizable with a lovely bathtub. The tea and cookies in the afternoon is a lovely touch, and the breakfast in the mornings is not to be missed.  It is our go to upon arrival and departure into Dublin.",5,2019,09,07
233,Discriminatory,"Probably the worst customer service I’ve ever encountered within a hotel/b&b context. I would go as far to say the staff of this establishment are discriminatory.
While booking a room, I noticed the stair climb needed to enter the house. My mother has a mobility scooter for long walking periods but can climb steps and walk short distances when needed. I emailed Denise initially to ask about disability assistance. I informed her we could either store away the scooter on ground level (a practice we used in Venice, Italy) or carry the scooter upon arrival/departure as our scooter is a manageable weight.
Denise has no interest in accommodating us and had a love for the word, “unfortunately.” 
We decided to call Ariel house to further explain as we had already booked four nights. Cecilia initially accepted our request for accommodation and explained we could store the scooter in the courtyard. Later, she rescinded her reply as Mrs. Unfortunately claimed they didn’t have the insurance to store away the scooter. We asked to speak with Natalie or Jennie to explain we would be completely financially responsible for any possible losses incurred. We were prevented from asking and felt completely disrespected by their delivery.
Alas, we will find another place of stay as we can only imagine how poorly we would be treated if staying at the Ariel House.
We hope Ms. Unfortunately and her senior apprentice, Cecilia will learn to have a bit more compassion for people with disabilities/mobility issues in the future.",1,2019,09,01
233,Great stay!,"The Ariel house was a fantastic stay! The staff were all absolutely awesome! The breakfast is amazing, and the Dart station is about 50 steps out the front door that takes you right down to the heart of the city! Very quiet and safe area. 
Would definitely recommend it, and would stay there again for sure! ",5,2019,08,28
233,Lovely guesthouse,"My husband and I stayed here for one night after attending a concert at the RDS. It was perfect for what we wanted it for - walking distance to the venue and a quiet place to stay.
The staff were warm and welcoming. We stayed in a double room which was huge. The spray in the shower wasn’t fantastic but the pressure was good - ultimately a nice, clean and comfortable room.
The cookies and cakes in the drawing room were a nice touch.
Breakfast was very busy, we had to wait around 10-15 minutes to be seated but weren’t in a rush so not an issue. The menu was varied and breakfast very good.
Ultimately a great little find.",4,2019,08,22
233,Monday night in Ariel!!,"When we need to stay in Dublin we always endeavour to book Ariel House as it is quite simply our favourite place to stay.  Over the years we have been so impressed with the very high standards maintained and have had no hesitation in recommending Ariel House to friends and family.  However, on Tuesday we left feeling disappointed with our breakfast.  My husband's bacon with his poached eggs was dry and overcooked while my choice for an uncooked breakfast was extremely limited - one choice of cheese, no cold meats, a nearly empty bread basket with no croissants, no yogurt - very disappointing.  I just felt this was not usual Ariel House standard.  We had already booked for 31st October and I do hope I have a better experience otherwise we will be forced to look elsewhere in future, which will be a shame!",3,2019,08,21
233,Great b&b with service that went above and beyond ,"Fantastic stay at Ariel House - the b&b is well looked after and served the very best breakfast! Our room was large and clean with everything we needed. It was a 25 min walk into town although train and bus is also nearby but great little pubs and restaurants also nearby. The best thing about Ariel for us was the staff who were friendly, professional and went above and beyond to help us. Would definitely recommend and stay here again. ",5,2019,08,04
233,Arriving in Ireland,"Very good service at all times of day and evening. We got all kinds of needed information about places to eat, transportations, events, 
We also were graciously given use, when needed, of the large living-room to have discussions and presentation to our whole touring group (14 people).
Breakfast had many offerings and always satisfying for varied diet styles.",5,2019,08,03
233,Perfect,"Great place to stay in Dublin. Situated in Ballsbridge ot is perfectly placed for concerts at aviva and 3 arena. Close to town centre. Breakfast each morning was superb. Great choice of food. Staff were very friendly and help answer all our questions for directions, ice etc. Would definitely stay again. We'll done.",5,2019,07,31
233,Comfortable and convenient,"This guesthouse is very handy for the Aviva Stadium ( literally a stone’s throw away) and the railway line into Dublin and beyond ( we took the train to Howth). In a quiet part of Dublin we walked to the Sandymount area for dinner. It’s very convenient if you wish to be just outside the centre. The breakfast was lovely - mix of pastries and cereals and a choice of cooked options. The full Irish was superb. The room was small and fairly old fashioned so you just need to accept it won’t have all the mod cons- it’s not that kind of place. Very friendly, comfortable and convenient. ",4,2019,07,15
233,A B&B charging hotel prices!,"I stayed in Ariel house last weekend and while the initial impression is very grand & gives  an air of elegance & style with its lovely sitting room complete with complimentary nespresso & coffee cake, this is really a rather boring spot! Not only is there no bar but there is no bar nearby either, added to this the fact that we arrived starving on a Saturday afternoon only to find all nearby decent restaurants not open yet (til 5pm).  Please understand i  was with a number of people and wasn't the one who made the booking so was very disappointed with the location.  The room itself was lovely clean and well equipped.  

Breakfast the following morning was also a disappointment- they had ran out of some of the full Irish breakfast items and the sausages looked under cooked to the point that we didn't eat them, scones were dry and not the freshest.  French toast was good though.  Also the location of the breakfast room in a packed glass conservatory was uncomfortably hot.

All staff were pleasant and helpful but in summary this is a B & B that charges hotel prices.",2,2019,07,13
233,A nice B&B in a lovely location,"I spent 3 nights here and found the staff very helpful.   Thank you Denise. Nice to have someone 24 hours/day at a desk.  Lovely front room where cakes/cookies and refreshments are served.  The breakfast was delicious with many homemade treats
and a tasty hot breakfast.  Didn't realize how many guests were staying until I went to breakfast. Ballsbridge is a beautiful section of Dublin.  Close to several good restaurants and pubs.  It is a healthy walk to the city center, but I felt safe.

I was slightly disappointed with my room- The George Bernard Shaw.  It was huge, with high ceilings and a front view.  One could tell there was some redecorating with newer draperies and a  king bed which was very comfortable.   The sitting area 
had some very loved seating that needed an update.  The carpeting was very worn
and needed a good shampoo- was not clean.  
Wifi worked well in the B&B. Expensive for a B&B, but located in a major city. Thank you.",4,2019,07,09
233,Good value considering Dublin prices,"Stayed one night at Ariel House.   It is very near a dart station which is convenient to get to the city centre. Parking is free but tight.  There is somebody in reception to let people in by night.  There are pubs and restaurants within easy walking distance.   The bed was comfortable. Furniture is antique in style.  There was plenty of hot water in the shower.  Breakfast was very good including homemade granola and fresh fruit.    Attentive staff serving. Newspapers and books are available to read in the drawing room and the complimentary coffee and cake/cookies is a welcome touch.  There was also tea/coffee making in the room with large mugs - which i like.
The only issues were that electric sockets were scarce and in an inconvenient location under the dressing table and the hair-dryer didn't work properly.  Also the corridors are a bit confusing.  Fairly expensive for B&B, but good value considering Dublin prices in general.  I would stay again.",4,2019,07,07
233,Charming Hotel in D4,Stayed here for 2 nights this week while we did some things in Dublin. The hotel is about 20 minutes walk from town but is situated in  a lovely part of the city. Our room was neat and tidy and very comfortable.  The room was very quiet too. Breakfast was served in the dining room by very friendly staff. The choice was great and there was lots of cereal available. Our hosts were lovely. The parking is extremely limited so come early. My only issue was the shower head was too close to the wall....not good coverage. :-),4,2019,06,28
233,Disappointed  ☹☹,"In my review I will give an honest opinion for my recent stay at this b&b. 
                                                                             I will review location , Staff & Room.                         

The location for Ariel House is brilliant. It is right beside the Aviva stadium & the RDS is only a 10 min walk away so it is perfect for events and shows...The city centre is also a short walk away..   

The staff are very friendly and helpful from the second you walk thought the door.  . I would like to give a special mention to the lady that checked us in and the waiter at breakfast....Amazing Customer Service.  ..There is a good choice for breakfast and the food is delicious.  

Now we come to the room....We booked a  Superior Double for our stay  and i'm sorry to say that there was nothing Superior about it..  The picture that is being used online to advertise a superior double looks nothing like the room we were given ..  The bath panel was cracked and broken.....The bath plug was also broken off the bath and left on top of the bath.  The view for our superior room was of bins , furniture  & the back of someone's house . The entire room was a total let down and it did kinda ruin our night...

The 1st picture I have uploaded is the picture currently being used to advertise their superior double room. The next 7 is of the bath ...the view and the actual room we got....",2,2019,06,25
233,Excellent Plus Plus,"What a really lovely authentic Dublin townhouse in a peaceful location, close to the DART rail system and not far from the city centre. The breakfast was amazing and really delicious. Great buffet of fresh fruit, yogurt and breads/jam. Superb menu of hot choices. We didnt have time to have some of the free afternoon tea and cakes in the drawing room but would like to do so next time we stay. Our room (238) was very comfortable with nice ensuite facilities including bath and a lovely view of the back garden. 

The service of the staff was also excellent, both in reception and breakfast room. We would like to make a special mention of Cecilia. Thank you Cecilia for helping us deal with a very difficult situation. Your kindness and willingness to go the extra mile to help will stay a long time in our memory. This was truly Irish hospitality at its very best. When we are next in Dublin Ariel House will be our first choice without doubt.",5,2019,06,20
233,"Excellent Guesthouse,  Good 4-star hotel","We loved our stay at Ariel. The staff is amazing and the breakfast to die for (& I am fussy so it's saying something). Location is very good too. The drawing room (photos) is very nice and offers 24/7 tea, coffee & cake. I was strongly tempted to give a 5-star, and would have if it had been called a guesthouse. However, as a 4-star hotel, it lacks a couple of things to make it to five star rating. There is no lift (persons with mobility issues or heavy luggage would find it challenging), a small TV and no minibar. The taps and flushing didn't work too well, though they were adequate. The room was clean and delicious little cakes were left on the dresser, which I thought was nice. Overall it was a great experience & I would gladly go again.",4,2019,06,19
233,"Good location away from hustle and bustle, good service","We enjoyed our night here. Be aware that it is NOT right in the center of Dublin, but in a outer area called Ballsbridge. Personally, we preferred that, since it was away from the craziness, traffic, and noise in the city center. It definitely is walkable, and although you can take the train there, we were 4 people and took a cab, and it was quite cheap. The neighborhood is quiet with plenty of restaurants within walking distance. Much more relaxing that the city center. Due to the location, it is also a little easier and cheaper to get to the cruise port, where we were heading next. Room was more than adequate, although we did have a ""Superior"" room which had a sitting area and more spacious. Curiously, our travelling companions had the same classification of room, but it was smaller. Nonetheless, both were fine, and breakfast the next morning was very good. Anyway, I would stay here again.",4,2019,06,19
233,Lovely hotel,"Loved our stay here.  Very friendly reception staff. Fab suite, massive bed, lovely garden view. Huge bathroom with shower and seperate corner bath, with toiletries.
Great choice of breakfast,  Afternoon cakes biscuits and coffee machine on the house, nice touch and much appreciated.
Handy for the Dart, easy to walk as well into temple bar area, good walk, through nice areas and down canal.
Would stay again if I visit Dublin.
Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2019,06,13
233,Very disappointed ,"I can not recommend this place.

Positives-
-attentive & friendly staff
-good breakfast 

Negatives-
-tired furnishings 
-low quality pillows, bedding
    & towels
-worn dirty carpet
-no Kleenex or extra toilet paper
-no bottled water in the room
-Chairs in awkward position that are unusable 
-coffepot had malfunctioning plug
-Plenty of room in the bathroom but  no table or shelf near pedestal sink for personal items
-Doors lock automatically without using the key so you could lock yourself out
-dead flowers on breakfast tables
-And did not like the location of this place. Preferred where we stayed before-by Stephens Green & Merrion Square Park-so much more convenient for walking to everything.
",2,2019,06,08
233,Nice place in Dublin close enough to walk,Nice hotel...nothng fancy but certainly adequate.  Room was clean and bathroom was adequate.We were downstairs so nothing much to look at. Breakfast was good too. Needs a bit of updating. Easy walk to downtown Dublin which is nice. Lots of restaurants close enough to walk to for dinner. Great little wine bar just up the road. ,4,2019,06,04
233,Classy Property!,"Located in the heart of Dublin's fashionable Ballsbridge, but with easy access to downtown train, bus or taxi (or walking if you're in shape!), Ariel House checks all the boxes for comfort and service.  Experienced staff will give you good advice on any Dublin-related question, often over the complimentary tea, coffee and cakes that are always available. Their recommendations about restaurants in the neighborhood were very helpful for us.  Our room was spacious and comfortable.  Only amenity we might have wished for was an in-room safe.  Breakfast, with a menu of choices, buffet or al a carte, was spectacular.  Highly recommended.  Only place we'd consider on a return visit to Dublin.",5,2019,06,03
233,Ireland tour,"On arrival we were assigned a large room, but very noisy overhead. Not sure if it was under dining room, but constant creaking on the floor above. Also toilet didn’t work. Asked to be moved. Staff very accommodating and moved us to another upper floor room. Much smaller but very quiet. 
On return at the end of our holiday, they were going to put us in the original room from our first day, but we requested a quieter room. Again they were accommodating, but this room was even smaller and the bed was too small for my husband’s height.
Breakfast was very good. ",3,2019,05,30
233,Excellent location,"I first stayed here 21 years ago, when it was under a prior owner.  It’s located in the upscale Ballsbridge area, in the shadow of the Aviva stadium, an easy, pleasant & simple 30 minute walk from downtown Dublin and also about 50 yards from a DART station, so downtown access is easy. This is a quiet and upscale neighborhood, a nice setting for a B&B.  The breakfast is excellent and varied, in a nice setting, though space is often tight if it is full.  Same for parking space.  Our room was spacious and the amenities as anticipated.  It could use a bit of sprucing up, as it’s showing its age, but the value is excellent.  One note - there are a lot of stairs.",4,2019,05,19
233,A gem of a hotel,"I booked this hotel for an overnight stay to see my stepdaughter with my husband.  We have been over many times but mostly went to another hotel.  When this hotel came up it looked good value for money.  That was such an understatement.  It exceeded our expectations.  So much so I featured it in my Youtube channel - Slimminginspirations4u. 
The room (251) was fabulous, breakfast was varied, catering for all tastes and the presentation was excellent.  I couldn't say anything bad, in fact, the next time we are in Dublin this is our first choice from now on.",5,2019,05,17
233,Spring Break Stay at Ariel House,We did not know what to expect but we ended up with a wonderful stay at the Ariel House. The staff could not have been more friendly and attentive to our needs and accommodations. Cecilia and Natalie were great for providing recommendations and booking cab and tour tickets for us. The breakfast was lovely and the staff was attentive in providing breakfast items to our table. The drawing room provided a comfortable atmosphere that allowed everyone staying at the Ariel House to meet each other and share a drink and a bite of complimentary sweets.,5,2019,05,16
233,Wonderful Guesthouse,"We stayed at Ariel House for our 3 night stay in Dublin.  It was wonderfully conveniently located near the DART (train) and a few blocks from many pubs and eateries of good quality. We had a very beautiful suite that had a bit worn furniture but a wonderful bed that you could actually sleep in.  The room was very Victorian in appearance and had gorgeous high ceilings and big windows.  The bathroom was clean and of nice size.

The best part of staying here was the staff and the amazing breakfasts!  I’ve never had such a wonderful selection of such delicious food for such a reasonable price.  Costs in Dublin were very high and we were thankful to have such an amazing breakfast included with our room. We highly recommend Ariel House and will stay here again should we visit Dublin.",5,2019,05,14
233,Lovely Victorian era guest house,"We had 2 night at Aerial in May. Extremely helpful staff and a wonderful breakfast. 50 metres to Lansdowne Rd railway station and a 10 minute walk to Ballsbridge shops pubs and restaurants.
Note for some travelers about a dozen steps to walk up to reception. While this does not worry us it may effect some travelers with mobility issues.",5,2019,05,13
233,Super Location & Awesome Breakfasts,"My husband and I spent 2 nights at Ariel Guesthouse. We had a lovely, bright room overlooking a very pretty tree-lined street. We were literally a 3 minute walk from the Dart (local train) that took us to downtown Dublin (about a 10 minute ride). We were also located extremely close to the Aviva Stadium. The check-in was seamless. We arrived early in the day, before our room was ready. The staff tagged our bags and moved them into our room later on that day while we were off exploring. When we first arrived we were offered breakfast in the dining room and had access to both a full breakfast as well as a variety of homemade goodies like fresh scones, banana bread, rhubarb & orange compote, spicy apple & tomato chutney and much more. Coffee was served in a French press and tea in a tea pot. Toast was made from homemade soda bread. They kindly shared the recipe for the chutney when we expressed how much we were enjoying it. Overall, a wonderful experience with friendly staff. Definitely recommend.",5,2019,05,10
233,Beautiful guest house,Absolutely charming place to stay. Very welcoming and lovely to walk into warm room with the light on. Breakfast is amazing and the morning and afternoon tea served in the lounge gave a lovely touch. We were very sad to have to leave to carry on with our travels. Faultless accommodation,5,2019,05,07
233,Charming place,"The house itself is lovely, and the room was comfortable. The breakfast was the highlight, and the staff were very friendly. The only reason that I am not giving it more stars is that we had just stayed in two amazing hotels that were more priceworthy.",3,2019,05,06
233,Very nice guest house. Great Breakfast,"Great bedroom, great staff, delicious breakfast (try the egg Benedict, yummy!)
Nice and quiet location with very easy access to the city center. We did not use the tram. We walked. It is only about 20 min away from Trinity College.
Also free parking though very tiny spots.
The reason I did not give a 5 stars is the bathroom. Quite tiny and not easy to get in and out the bathtub. ",4,2019,05,05
233,Great Breakfast and Service,The Ariel House went above and beyond to accommodate us upon an earlier than expected arrival from the states. The breakfast was delicious and lll if the staff so helpful! The tea and treats won the drawing room were lovely as well!,4,2019,04,29
233,Charming old hotel with modern rooms,"I had very high expectations based on the reviews I read for Ariel House, and was not disappointed.  This small hotel is in a lovely neighborhood, and although it’s about a mile from the city center, that is easily reachable by the DART (station a few hundred feet away) or bus.  It’s also a nice walk.

I received a friendly greeting every time I walked in.  Although my room wasn’t ready when I arrived they were able to take my luggage and offer me breakfast.  And the breakfasts are fantastic - lots of choices from full Irish breakfast to eggs, smoked salmon, pancakes, as well as continental breakfast choices.  Breakfast is served in a bright sunroom, also very pleasant. 

Room was absolutely fine, comfortable bed.  Note that the stairways are a bit steep and narrow, not a big deal for me.  Another thing to keep in mind is that it’s a block from Aviva Stadium.  There was a match between Ireland and Georgia so I had a little trouble getting down the street past game security to the hotel entrance. Again, not a big deal but one thing to be aware of is that there will be crowds in the vicinity when there’s a stadium event.

A number of good dining choices are within 5-10 minutes walk, even more on Upper Baggot Street a bit farther.

When I return to Dublin this will be my first choice, without question, no need to look anywhere else.",5,2019,04,21
233,lovely stay,"Lovely house, very nice staff and helpful. Food was delicious in the morning and flexible        Would love to return again to Dublin and will stay here if bookable as we really enjoyed it........

233,Had a flying visit to dublin ,Stayed at ariel house for 1 night 11 th April greeted by lovey lady upon our arrival room was so big and imaculate lovely bathroom so took advantage for my aching feet as I decided to walk in to dublin from the airport 😢 bed super big and comfy had fab nights sleep breakfast was big beautifully cooked and plentiful set us up for our day on dublin tea and cake in the drawing room upon return what a treat all staff were really lovely and couldn't of been nicer will definatly be back well done all 👍🇬🇧,5,2019,04,18
233,Really enjoyed our stay,"we recently stayed 3 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The staff went out of their way to make sure that all our needs were met.  Hot tea, flavored water, nespresso coffee, cookies, cakes, etc were available in the reception room throughout the day. The Irish breakfasts that we ordered off the menu each day were exceptionally well cooked and plentiful. We looked forward each day to starting out with their breakfast. The junior suite that we stayed in was better than any room that we have stayed in London or Paris. The staff printed up our boarding passes before we left and called us a cab for the ride to the airport. We would not stay anywhere else in Dublin. Get a visitor leap card for the Dart rail and get off at the Lansdowne station. Ariel house is one block away in a quiet neighborhood.",5,2019,04,12
233,Avoid room 229 - disturbed sleep,"I agree with positive reviews regarding friendly staff, generous breakfasts and very handy location for dart train station. Unfortunately, our stay was seriously marred by disturbed sleep (and neither of us are light sleepers). The room above had the creakiest, loudest floorboards and the noise insulation was poor (conversations clearly audible), a communal door outside our room banged loudly every time  it was used (and it was used frequently). Separately, the bathroom for room 229 is also in need of an update.  Cannot comment on other rooms but for these reasons I would advise against staying in room 229.",3,2019,04,12
233,Great stay! Good luck Clodagh! ,Stayed here in April. Loved my stay. Everything was really lovely and am already planning a trip back! I’d like to especially thank the lovely Clodagh who was super helpful when I arrived in all jet lagged after a 20 hr trip! And who was so sweet the next day too! Unfortunately she told me this is her last week. :-( but she said Cecilia and all the others are fab too- which I’ve no doubt they are. Breakfast was excellent and my room and bathroom warm and spotlessly clean! Highly recommend!! ,5,2019,04,04
233,Very Disappointed,"We had been touring around Ireland for 10 days and this was our last hotel before home.What a disappointment! We had booked a garden view but the view we had was of a old toilet and a block of toilets ! The room was comfortable enough but our toilet in the bathroom was dirty and we had to call the concierge to clean it. Breakfast was not the standard other reviewers have given, my porridge was Luke warm , and my husbands Irish breakfast small. I hate to say. We did get apologies from the manageress and a room rate reduction, but it wasn’t about the money. It was our last day in Ireland and it was ruined. The hotels lounge is lovely and our stay could have been much more. We would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",1,2019,03,29
233,Exceptional as always,"We have stayed at Ariel House a few times and cannot fault any aspect. Staff are all fantastic, rooms are elegant and comfortable, breakfast is delightful. There is a welcoming atmosphere from everyone you encounter and the staff always go above and beyond to make every stay exceptional.",5,2019,03,28
233,"Stunning property, excellent location","We stayed here for two nights around St Patrick's Day in 2019, and were incredibly impressed with our experience. Huge rooms, with plenty of space, a large common area for relaxing in, and extremely helpful staff all combined to make this the perfect spot to stay for an incredibly busy few days in Dublin. Location is absolutely perfect too, being right nest door to Aviva Stadium/Lansdowne Road Train station, witha few pubs and restaurants also a short walk away.",5,2019,03,25
233,Excellent hotel in a good location,The staff are unfailingly helpful.  The area is quiet and yet offers easy access to the centre of Dublin either by bus or the Dart overground which is literally almost next door.  The rooms are spotlessly clean and the breakfasts are wonderful.  I had the best poached egg ever!  I am planing to return as soon as I can.  Cannot recommend highly enough!,5,2019,03,13
233,Home from Home!,"I have stayed in this wonderful guesthouse on many previous occasions & it does not disappoint....yes the rooms are dated but spotlessly clean...yes it is not the epitomy of modern architecture but a lovingly restored Victorian building.... but what it offers in customer service is very special. I made my initial booking with Jilly who immediately offered me a complimentary upgrade when she learned that I was revisiting with my daughter on a birthday treat!. When we arrived early(12.30)pm the lovely Clodagh informed us that our room was available & told us to settle in while she organised complimentary coffee/cakes in their delightful drawing room for us...this does NOT happen in your modern trendy hotel. After our obligatory shopping that afternoon to Grafton Street, we returned weary of foot but high in spirit to a warm welcome from Cecily. We were greeted like long lost relatives....what can I say about this lady....truly wonderful...thank you!. Despite the fact that we had dinner out that night, we went to bed saying that we were looking forward to the famous ‘Ariel House’ breakfast the next morning. It did not disappoint...truly delicious 😋 Such is my daughter’s love of this fine establishment, she plus four friends are returning in a couple of weeks time...thank you to all.",5,2019,03,09
233,Excellent location.,"Enjoyed our stay at the guest house, lovely helpful receptionist, as are all the staff. Clean and comfortable room and amazing breakfast. Very good location.  Will definitely stay there again next time in Dublin.",5,2019,03,09
233,Second year in a row,"I enjoyed it last time, and this time it’s just as good. I’m already looking forward to the breakfast, which is one of the highlights of a stay here. In Lansdowne road right next to the rugby stadium. Shame I couldn’t go to a match.",5,2019,03,07
233,"Excellent location, otherwise very ordinary","Ariel House is in an ideal location for anyone arriving in Dublin by car. There is free parking in the forecourt and Lansdowne Road station is barely a couple of hundred yards away with frequent trains to the town centre for a couple of euros.

Our room, 252, was supposedly a garden view double room however the 'garden' was a barely cultivated patch some two stories down below - a bit of a misnomer. The room itself was a good size, well carpeted and with comfortable pillows. However in addition to the rather small double bed and a further single bed - this space could have been better occupied by a table. The room was rather bleak - not a single picture! Nor indeed was there a wastepaper basket, although one did arrive a day later! The bath plug chain was broken throughout our stay - we didn't bother to point this out as one would have expected the staff to have noticed this.

We went into Dublin on our first morning, returning at lunchtime. The room had not been made up and, when we pointed this out, we got a rather offhand and limp excuse to the effect that they had not got around to it!

Breakfast in a somewhat crowded room was adequate - decent but unmemorable.

One plus was a lounge with decent coffee and cakes.

The cost for 2 nights B&B was €250. Rather more than the cost for our previous 2 nights at the Granville in Waterford with infinitely superior service.

However on the plus side the location is excellent!",3,2019,02,28
233,4 nights in Dublin,We stayed at the Ariel House for all four nights in Dublin. It is one block from the Lansdowne DART station.  It was super easy to get to all points in Dublin from there. The country breakfasts were great.  The furnishings are a little dated but that did not matter as we were out and about all day long.,5,2019,02,22
233,Coulndt ask for more,"I spent 4 nights at the Areil house and coulndt have been happier. I usually suffer from jet lag but this cozy place put me right to sleep. The staff here is the most friendly and accommodating people one could ask for. Breakfast here is the most appended way to start your morning.

The building has lots of personality and would make a great couples weekend retreat or a week long holiday.

I will defiantly be returning to this place!!!",5,2019,02,14
233,Night away.,"Stayed here on a Friday night with a friend. From check in, to the spacious bedroom to the stunning choice of breakfast the next day to the check out, the service was fabulous.
I would highly recommend here if staying in Dublin. Staff were friendly and welcoming
Close to the city.
Looking forward to my return!!
",5,2019,02,13
233,Very kind staff,"Lovely place, it was pleasant enough to walk to Dublin City center - about 25 min. If walking isn’t your thing, there is a train you can catch at the end of the road and the journey is about the same time. Very close to the Aviva Stadium, bonus if you are attending an event there.

The staff was really nice, chatty and helpful. I struggled to find a place that served food after 8pm on a Sunday, so I got a takeaway delivered and the lady at reception did not mind at all.

Breakfast was really lovely - good food, made as ordered.

The only thing to be aware of is there are limited parking spaces and if you have a big/long vehicle it can be challenging (my CH-R wasn’t the easiest to manoeuvre but I got there in the end).",4,2019,02,06
233,A gem,"Due to our usual hotel was closed for renovations , we selected this hotel as it was near the RDS where we were having an exhibition for five days

We were very impressed as the hotel has character, relaxing, very helpful staff, brilliant breakfast and within walking distance to both Dublin and the RDS. 

We have stayed at our previous hotel for the last twelve years but will be returning to Ariel Hotel. The only slight drawback is the wood work needs a touch of paint hence the reason I have given it four stars - it deserves five stars!",4,2019,02,04
233,Perfect,"Simply amazing. They fulfilled my request for a pic of Nicolas Cage by the bedside :^)

The receptionist went out of her way for me. Despite me missing breakfast, they made me some anyway.

Definitely the place to go if you visit Dublin.",5,2019,01,31
233,Short break first time visitor to Dublin,"The accommodation is in a grand old property in the quiet, upmarket area of Ballsbridge. Travel into town with ease as the Dart train station at the end of the road.All staff very friendly and helpful, lovely breakfast-lots of choice and plenty of time to relax and enjoy at your leisure. Tea/coffee and freshly made cake on offer in the drawing room each afternoon.The rooms were warm and comfortable.We were travelling for our Daughter’s 18th birthday - we came back to our room to find fresh cake and fruit along with a Birthday card-very much appreciated.",5,2019,01,26
233,Afternoon Tea ,"Booked afternoon tea for 14 people here for a baby shower and we could not have had better service! The food was delicious, tea constantly topped up and the room we had was so pretty. Staff were so helpful during the booking process and I would definitely recommend! ",5,2019,01,13
233,Couldn`t be better,"From check in to check out our trip was top class.
Staff excellent, room 100% , breakfast excellent and location close to Dart station was great to get to town in minutes and also opens up the whole Dublin Bay area.

 
we will return !!",5,2019,01,11
233,Slightly underwhelmed,"We found our stay average. On arrival the b&b looks very impressive with a welcoming staff and sitting room. However, our room was very basic. We also celebrated a birthday at the b&b. I mentioned this while booking but this was not acknowledged whatsoever, which was disappointing for price paid. Better options available.",3,2019,01,08
233,Favourite place to stay in Dublin. ,"Great rooms - the suites especially are gorgeous. The reception area, amd receptionists, are lovely. Awesome breakfast, both the buffet choices and the menu.

Very handy location too. Have stayed here four times and can't fault it.",5,2018,12,31
233,Fantastic,This is a long overdue review to say that Ariel house is the best and nicest place to stay and the staff went above and beyond to help me when I booked last minute because I needed somewhere near St Vincent's hospital. What may seem like simply good customer service meant the world to two very weary and worried guests. Aside from that the breakfast was amazing and rooms very comfortable!,5,2018,12,28
233,Excellent hotel and great value for money ,"Stayed just for 1 night with 2 other couples. Wished we could have stayed longer. 
We were all very impressed. Very friendly staff, comfortable rooms and great breakfast. Hotel is in a very good part of Dublin, close to the city. Most hotels in this area cost a lot more but don’t have the friendly and cosy atmosphere of Ariel House. 
Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2018,12,13
233,Impressive!,"We decided to take a last minute trip to Ireland over Thanksgiving to celebrate our 1st Anniversary and I researched many Airbnbs, hotels and B and Bs looking for the perfect place to stay. I am thrilled to have landed at the Ariel House. The staff went above and beyond at every opportunity to make our stay most wonderful. Cecily and Rory assisted with everything from getting us checked in a little early, providing directions, ordering taxi's to assisting us with our luggage during an overnight train trip. They were so pleasant and most helpful. They helped us celebrate our anniversary with their thoughtful touches. 
 We had two rooms as we took an overnight trip. The first one was on the second floor and had a nice view out of the front of the house and the second one was two staircases down with windows to the courtyard. The location of the house is in a normal neighborhood so there are no sweeping views to be had from any room, but the area is quite nice. Few minor flaws in each room, but nothing that caused us any concern. It is an older home with no elevator so keep that in mind. The location was two blocks from the DART station and everyday we made our way around Dublin starting with DART. Perfect location if you want peaceful surroundings with access to public transportation. 
And lastly, the breakfast was absolutely delicious. I still think about the pancakes! I can see why it was voted top in Dublin. It was nice that this was fully included in our room rate. Many I searched charged extra for a full hot breakfast. Staff in the breakfast room were spot on. I would highly recommend Ariel House.",5,2018,12,03
233,Excellent B&B,My wife and I had three nights at Ariel House. Our room was a junior suite which was spacious with a nice sitting area. Breakfast was excellent and the staff was very kind. It was a good value especially during the week. Right next to the DART train and two blocks away from buses in to town as was as the Airlink bus to the Airport. ,5,2018,11,29
233,3 day stay,"Helpful, courteous staff. Really good breakfast. Room wasn’t quite to the standard we expected for the cost and located down many stairs and appeared to be below street level. Informed at other establishments we stared at that it was premium cost establishment. Location good but information supplied not always accurate.",4,2018,11,18
233,Lovely guest house if quiet suburb of Dublin,"We stayed two nights at the Ariel House in October, 2018. The rooms were very nice, although quite small and had no view or outlook to speak of. We liked the quiet location near Ballsbridge, a suburb or Dublin. The train station was less than a block from the Ariel, so access to the city center was easy. It was also a reasonable walk to the cities attractions (maybe 2 miles?). We found several very nice restaurants and pubs close to the Ariel and enjoyed feeling part of the community. The service at the Ariel was excellent.",5,2018,11,11
233,Nothing bad to say! :-),"This place is absolutely PERFECT! Well located in a very quiet place, near the DART Train Lansdowne Road Station, very easy to reach the center of Dublin, even by walking. Members of the staff are ALL lovely and helpful. No problems with late arrivals or to keep our luggage for our last day.The breakfast is amazing, congratulations to the cookers! Special tribute to the scones ;-) Beds and linen are so comfy it's hard to wake up at morning!
Room and bathroom are so clean you can walk barefoot everywhere.
May I suggest to give the guests the choice of having new clean towels everyday OR NOT: as we stayed 4 nights, we could have kept the same towels, to help saving energy and the Planet....
Surely recommend this place ++++",5,2018,11,11
233,Great place,Visited the guest house staff so friendly excellent breakfast very clean and welcoming I was ill and so helpful close to to Avis stadium and trains so easy to get around Dublin fantastic place so much to do,5,2018,11,06
233,Perfect,"Stayed of one night, 2nd of November. We were greeted with a very friendly young man on reception. Stayed in our lovely clean room and had a beauty breakfast the following morning. Not often you're offered smoked salmon as part of your breakfast. Great value for money .",5,2018,11,06
233,Family trip to Ireland,5 of us arrive Oct.4 and stayed in 2 rooms for 1 night at the beginning of our 2 week stay. We returned Oct. 17-19 before we left Dublin. The hotel was very comfortable and had gluten free options for the celiacs in our group. It's just a short cab ride to town center. Local pubs nearby are great. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Definitely would stay here again.,5,2018,11,04
233,Lovely hotel with brilliant breakfasts!,"We travelled to Dublin to attend a Counting Crows Concert, but since neither of us had been to Dublin Before, we decided to make it an extended weekend... and we decided that we really wanted a nice hotel within reasonable distance from the Concert venue and the city centre. We chose Ariel House in Ballsbridge. The neighbourhood suited us perfectly, being a quiet residential area 25 minutes walk from the city centre (and the DART's only a couple of minutes from the hotel), and Ariel House did not dissapoint - far from it. We got great service, a great room on the upper floor, and breakfasts that ranks amoung the very best we've ever had! Highly recommended, and we will definitely be back.",5,2018,10,31
233,Pleasant Guest House outside Dublin city,Friendly staff very willing to oblige and to help with requests. Large bedrooms with modern bathrooms in a quiet area outside city of Dublin. Easy & quick access to city centre from train station 500m away. Free parking at hotel or along the street. A good breakfast with plenty of choice.,5,2018,10,29
233,A lovely stay,"We had been recommended Ariel House for our stay in Dublin, and it did not disappoint. All the staff were so helpful with information and suggestions for our stay, and when shown our room we had been left some homemade cookies. Great location, large room and amazing breakfast, we had a great stay.",5,2018,10,22
233,Great stay,"We stayed two nights in July and enjoyed our stay.  It was very convenient to walk a block to catch the DART a couple of stops to Dublin.  Our room was lovely, very big and comfortable bed. It was nice to come back in the evening to Ariel House and there was lots of space in the common living room to relax, have a cup of tea and a cookie.  The breakfast was amazing, so many choices and delicious.  We had to leave early the 2nd day to get to the airport and they gave us a small take away breakfast.  The neighborhood is beautiful and a few blocks away are pubs and restaurants.",5,2018,10,21
233,Creepy crawlies,I booked a one night on 8 October 2018. Arrived about 22:30 and headed to room after checkin. As soon as I entered room I noticed something small and black moving on the pillow. Ant like creature. I pulled back the duvet and there was a second one on the sheet. I returned to reception and asked the gentleman manning the desk to accompany me to the room. When I showed him the unwanted guests he apologized and suggested a change of bed linen. I declined and as there was no other rooms available I left immediately and booked a room in the Ballsbridge Hotel. I was not charged by Ariel House for the room.,1,2018,10,20
233,Will Go Back,We were so pleased we chose Ariel House to stay at. The staff were very welcoming. Our room was big and very quiet. Breakfast was among the best of our trip with menu to choose from. It's a about a 20 walk to the main area of Dublin but a nice walk and not the high prices either for hotels in the central area. Great location if you are attending Aviva Stadium. Also had car parking.,4,2018,10,17
233,A Fine Stay,"Located in a relatively calm part of the city, Ariel House is well served by public transportations options - Dart and buses. Rooms are comfortable and the breakfast is the star of the show. The staff members are friendly and helpful.",4,2018,10,14
233,Amazing Service and Breakfast!,"From check-in to check-out, our experience was top-notch. After a long flight, we were greeted warmly with an offer of tea, scones and jam from the breakfast buffet. The breakfasts were amazing...both buffet and ordering from the menu options. I had smoked salmon and potato cakes two days...very delicious. The friendly and helpful staff and comfortable and welcoming atmosphere are what sets this hotel apart from everywhere else we stayed on our trip. Had a room in the basement, which was quiet and clean with a view of trees and yard. Could hear birds chirping. would return here in a heartbeat!",5,2018,10,08
233,Iteland,"We stayed at the Ariel House for one night  at the end of our stay in Ireland. Our room was ok, but tired looking. The hair dryer in the bathroom did not work. There was another one provided but absolutely no mirror in sight. Rust coming down the bathroom tile. 
The staff was friendly and helpful. I would not stay there again. There are definitely better choices in Dublin.",3,2018,10,07
233,Amazing stay,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this beautiful house. The interiour is tastefully decorated and is comfortable and inviting. What sets this place apart is the incredible staff - very friendly and helpful! Can‘t wait to come back soon!,5,2018,10,06
233,Nice hotel good location,"The staff at ariel house is what puts this hotel over the top. The check in check out at ariel house very smooth, breakfast and breakfast room top notch. Bed very comfortable, pillows not so much, though on request we did get four different pillows, that were only slightly better, we worked around them. Our room was large and the bath had been recently remodeled and was very comfortable. We were on the 3rd floor there is no elevator ( lift ) there is a young gentleman who takes your bags to your room, but for the elderly and those not in any kind of shape its about four floors to the top from ground level. Its about 3/4 of a floor from ground level to the first floor. This is not a complaint but a warning my wife and I had no problem some might. There is a dart station at the end of the block and about a 20 minute walk to town.",4,2018,10,04
233,Lovely house. Nydelig hus.,"I had the time of my life in Dublin last week. I was there for the Shania Twain concerts at 3Arena. When i arrived at Ariel House i was met by a guy who took my luggage and escorted me to the reception. I saw beautiful rooms, a livingrooms with tea, homemade cakes where you can enjoy the day. The people who works there are so kind and nice. I was very surprised when they carried my luggage to my room. My room was beautiful. The view was also good. 

Dublin as a city are very easy to find your way around. I had not much trouble finding places to eat or finding the 3Arena for the Shania Twain shows. I had the time of my life there. My dream finally came true. Seeing Shania has been my dream for nearly 19 years. I am so grateful for last week and how the people at Ariel House treated me. I know that i want to come back to Dublin someday. And i will then be back at Ariel House! That area was so quiet and not that big. The breakfast was also very good. Thank you for doing this week even better. Best wishes.",5,2018,10,03
233,Very comfortable stay (twice!),"We had booked a week touring in Ireland and stayed at Aerial House on the Monday and Friday evenings. We had booked a Junior Suite on both nights and were allocated different rooms. The rooms were spacious, perfectly comfortable and well equipped with lovely antique furniture and a comfortable four poster bed. The breakfast was excellent with a range of hot and cold options.",4,2018,10,03
233,Exceeded Expectations,My husband and I stayed for 3 nights at the Ariel House to wrap up our 2-week Ireland vacation. So glad we chose this hotel to end our trip. It was just lovely. We received such wonderful service from all the staff. Our room was exceptional. Breakfasts were fantastic. Public transportation options very close by.  I would recommend highly.,5,2018,10,01
233,Beautiful and great location!,"My requirements for a good hotel are comfortable, clean and quiet.  Ariel House had all that and more.  The rooms are beautiful and spacious.  You can leave your rental car at Ariel House in their off street parking.  Walk a couple of blocks to the DART station for a quick ride downtown.  The breakfast was the best we had in Ireland.",5,2018,10,01
233,Wish we could have stayed longer,"We anticipated a nice stay and were not disappointed.
We e-mailed that we'd arrive early to stow our bags and (after an overnight flight from the States) did so about 6:30am.  Fernando could not be more cordial invited us to have coffee and unwind. 
Thankfully, Rory accommodated us with a very nice room well before ""normal"" check-in, so, re really had a night and a-half of Ariel's hospitality.
""Official"" breakfast the next morning was quite remarkable...they had an enormous range at the buffet and wonderful table service.  We chatted with a number of other guests at breakfast...a great primer for our week there.
I don't know how many guests the Ariel House serves (maybe 15/20?) but, they do an awfully good job. All the best elements of a lovely boutique. As we were joining a tour  beginning at another hotel, we had mixed emotions leaving the Ariel family. We would ABSOLUTELY stay there again.
PS: Ariel is in a very nice and quiet residential area convenient to the Beggar's Bush neighborhood with some great and  authentic pubs and restaurants.  I don't know how active it might get if there;'s a game or concert at Aviva Stadium nearby but, our room was very peaceful.",5,2018,09,29
233,Wonderful,"My husband and I traveled to Ireland for our anniversary trip and stayed at the Ariel House for two nights.  We felt so welcomed by the staff, our room was just perfect, and the breakfast was delicious.  The location was great for us because it was just a quick minute or two walk to the DART Landsdowne station.  ",5,2018,09,29
233,Perfect stay in Dublin,We stayed at this hotel on our first night in Dublin.  We arrived prior to check in but the staff allowed us in to our room early and provided us with coffee and snacks.  The room was comfortable and clean.  The breakfast buffet was absolutely beautiful and delicious.,4,2018,09,28
233,Wonderful But accessibilty could be a problem,"First off, the staff at Ariel House could not have been nicer. Their recommendations and directions were spot on. Breakfast had a cold buffet and hot breakfasts were cooked to order. A couple things to be aware of: there are steep steps to get into Ariel House (hence the accessibility warning), the tubs are very deep which can be a challenge to get out of if you are short and if you are used to big, fluffy pillows you will not find them here. It is an older building and we sometimes found it took a bit of getting used to when opening the room doors. The sitting room was very comfortable and a great place to relax and visit. Good pubs and restaurants are within short walking distance as is the Dart station. Dublin city center is a bit of a hike but definitely doable. I would highly recommend Ariel House for your stay in Dublin.",4,2018,09,28
233,Best experience ever,"We went to Dublin and the Ariel House with high expectations and were not disappointed - on the contrary! A wonderful welcome and sweet surprise for my birthday girl awaiting us (homemade chocolate cookies - still warm, hhhhmmm), comfy room and bed, extraordinary breakfast - we loved every moment! The staff super friendly and caring - thank you Ariel House for a great weekend!!!",5,2018,09,24
233,Comfortable Hotel with Very Good Breakfasts,"We spent 5 nights at this hotel.  The staff were professional and helpful.  The hotel is clean and well-appointed.  It is located in a residential part of Dublin, but it is only a short DART (rail) ride to the city center.  A short walk away, there is a laundry drop off where your laundry can be done for you at a reasonable price. The complimentary breakfast is very good with buffet and ready to order items.  The upstairs junior suite, where we spent 4 nights,  is out-dated with broken knobs on drawers and uncomfortable sofa.  The bottom level suite, where we spent 1 night,  was modern and comfortable. The afternoon tea was good, but I could not find napkins.  Overall, we had a good stay and would not hesitate to stay here again.",4,2018,09,20
233,Fantastic ,"I can’t begin to describe how brilliant Ariel House is. Conveniently located near the Dart train or a 25 minute walk to the centre of town, this charming lodge oozes old world sentiment. The staff are so friendly and helpful (they even gave my friend and I a top sheet without asking, when the duvets proved too hot at night!) and the breakfast is divine. The beauty of Ariel House is illustrated by the lounge room and gardens that visitors can use at their leisure. The rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated and the beds are very comfortable. 
My friends an I loved our stay here (pretty much the best place we stayed in during our stay in Ireland) and would love to come back one day. ",5,2018,09,19
233,Back for a 2nd time!,"I returned to Ariel House for my second visit in August, this time with my daughter.  The first pleasant visit was not a fluke. :)  We had an absolutely lovely and spacious Superior Double Room on the 2nd floor with a peaceful view of the tree-lined street and the houses across the way.  I spent my teenage daughter's jetlag nap sitting on the sofa in the sitting area, journalling, watching the world go by, and nibbling on the still-warm chocolate chocolate chip cookies (!!!) that were left in our room for us.

Having stayed here once before, I knew that the DART station was barely half a block away so we availed of that often to get into town.  Our first morning, not quite acclimated to the time change yet, we even hopped a train early in the morning to pop down to Dun Laoghaire for a walk around the marina before coming back for breakfast.

WHICH was divine.  The breakfast room staff is always attentive and professional, and the breakfast itself is my favorite every trip.  The Irish breakfast is so good -- but those pancakes.  Melt in your mouth awesome.",5,2018,09,18
233,Lovely place to stay,The staff were friendly and helpful - perhaps the most congenital staff I’ve ever experienced. The location was exceptionally convenient to the train and the bus. The location was quiet. The only negative was that the bed was a particularly comfortable. That is an easy remedy. ,4,2018,09,18
233,Nice and peaceful stay in a lovely part of the city,"I stayed here for one night B&B.  Very comfortable if rather small rooms.  The staff are welcoming, friendly and efficient. Breakfast was great with a lovely view of the gardens. The location is really great for a business stay or as a tourist.  I stayed over the weekend when Ballsbridge was quiet.  Great spot for nice walks along the canal or the leafy streets of Dublin.",4,2018,09,10
233,"Excellent breakfast, good room","The highlight of this B&B is the breakfast. There are many great choices to order and there is also a buffet. Besides the traditional Irish breakfast, try the smoked salmon -- it is terrific. The location was good for us because we like to be out of the middle of town and walk a little. The room was large, the bed pretty good, the bathroom a bit small and the bath a bit narrow. The communal drawing room is quite comfortable with coffee and cookies. Overall, a very good B&B.",5,2018,09,04
233,Weird Water Rule,After finding no water room told payment needed for more than 2 x 330ml still water. So how to make tea or coffee and have water to drink withour extra charge not clear. Good breakfast and cleaning staff. FoH desk staff appear confused about service staff and guest relationship. Not international standard. More training may help them.,3,2018,09,03
233,A great B and B,"Situated in a quiet area just 30 minutes walk from town and a stone's throw from the railway station and buses is this very nice guest house.

Our room, though not huge, was comfortable, spotless and well maintained, as were the comfortable lounge (in which refreshments were available) and bright breakfast room.  Our bathroom was well equipped and towels were changed whenever used. 

The breakfasts were superb.  Although there was a buffet table there was an extensive menu of breakfasts ranging from the super healthy through to the full Irish.  Eat what you want as much as you want and all served quickly with a smile.  The food was all freshly cooked and beautifully presented.  A top notch chef is obviously lurking in the kitchen  Although a larger guest house all the staff were friendly and extremely helpful.  Recommended wholeheartedly.",5,2018,09,03
233,Homey and welcome atmosphere in the city,"My wife and I spent 4 nights here in August, while touring Dublin.  The room was compact but comfortable.  We arrived during an unusual hot spell and our room was stuffy.  The staff moved quickly and cheerfully to install some fans that cooled it off nicely. The breakfasts were elegant and tasty, prepared with great attention to detail.  A continental breakfast was included with the room, but if you want a full Irish breakfast there's an extra charge--I believe around 15 euros each.  The poached eggs and salmon was a treat on our first morning in Ireland.  The rail station is just a 5 minute walk away, and there are several good restaurants about a 10 minute walk north.  To and from the airport we took the Aircoach route 702 at the Ballsbridge Hotel stop.  That's a quick, affordable way to that part of town, but it's a bit of a walk to Ariel House, especially dragging a couple of suitcases.  The best part of our stay at Ariel House was the staff, who were unerringly polite, kind, and helpful.  We booked our room through Ariel house's website, and found they responded to email questions quickly.",5,2018,09,01
233,Great Location and Warm Touches,"What a gorgeous hotel this place is located right next to the Landsdowne Road Dart station. A perfect location within walking distance from the beautiful Grafton Street.

So many warm touches that you don’t get in most hotels these days. Warmly greeted checking in, shown to the front room where scones, tea, coffee and drinks are available all day.

We stayed in the family room which was more than comfortable for the 4 of us adults. The bathrooms were gorgeous and spotless, plenty of towels, the power shower was amazing and the toiletries were beautiful.

Rory the manager was on hand to answer any questions you might have.

I had read the reviews beforehand and everyone had mentioned the breakfast and they weren’t wrong. One of the best Irish breakfasts I’ve ever had! Not greasy, service was super quick and portion sizes were perfect. The staff are such a credit to the hotel, everyone is so friendly and helpful.

Free parking is available right in front of the hotel and extra parking in the next gate as well.

Would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in Dublin as its close to the DART station that will bring you all over the city, close to the city centre via foot and right next to the Aviva stadium for any sports games or concerts!",5,2018,08,28
233,"Nice, but needs some updating","My friend and I stayed one night here- arrived early after an overnight flight from the US. Rory, the manager, greeted us at the door and showed us to the drawing room, where we were settled in comfortable chairs and given fresh scones and hot coffee. They worked to get a room ready for us and after an hour or so we were given a room just upstairs from reception . Room was large, beds comfy, but shower did not provide hot water and hair dryer was non functional. They tried to fix the shower but the next day it was still not right. Breakfast was very good though and staff very friendly and accommodating .  Nice location too close to DART station in quiet residential setting. ",4,2018,08,26
233,Really good value for money,"My girlfriend and I stayed for four nights having travelled down from Belfast as part of our annual holiday.
It is a gem and has all the qualities required of  a very good hotel! 
- The reception staff are efficient, friendly and very helpful without being overbearing
- Breakfasts are excellent with a wide choice and served by friendly waiters/waitresses in a beautiful dining room
- Coffee, tea and cake available in the residents’ lounge
- Our room was spacious, well appointed and serviced. It also had a very good WIFI.
Location is brilliant 
- Three minutes’ walk to the Lansdowne Road train station (you can’t miss it) with a 10 – 15 minute train ride into the centre
- There are local pubs that are typically Irish and serve good food. They are located on the Merrion Road opposite the RDS Venue and can be reached by a short, pleasant walk along the River Dodder.
Only downside is parking onsite is limited but there is on-road available.  The staff are very helpful in this and as we left were doing a grand job of coping with the guests arriving for the Dublin Horse Show",5,2018,08,25
233,Very nice,"Chose Ariel House based on TripAdvisor reviews and we were completely satisfied.  Our room was quite large, very clean and comfortable.  Breakfast was excellent, with many choices.  We found the staff (especially Cecelia) to be very friendly and helpful.  It is a good walk into town, but public transportation is close by.  We would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2018,08,24
233,Ariel House is a wonderful hotel made exceptional by it's staff.,"We had to make a trip to Dublin for my husband to attend some hospital appointments. We've stayed at Ariel House before, and picked it again because of how much we've enjoyed our other stays with them. However, this visit was exceptional because of their staff. 

I phoned the night before and spoke to Clodagh on reception about the possibility of an early check in, as I knew we would be finished with the appointments by around 11am. She promised that she would do her best for us - and she absolutely did! We arrived at the hotel at around 11.30am and were warmly greeted by Cecilia. We were able to check in immediately into a beautiful quiet room on the top floor (The Johnathan Swift Room) and this honestly just made the whole day so much better. My husband was able to rest for the afternoon, and we were even able to go out and enjoy our evening because of this kindness. It is a small gesture that meant so much to us under the circumstances. We felt that every member of staff were very genuine, kind and helpful. Ariel House's greatest asset is without a doubt the people who work there. 

This hotel is a beautiful old manor house with comfortable beds, incredible breakfast offerings, and attentive staff. We don't stay anywhere else in Dublin.",5,2018,08,24
233,Great Dublin B&B,"Recently stayed here when visiting Dublin for conference.  This B&B is centrally located, easily accessible by bus and train to center, and also about 30 mins walk to center.  This is residential area and its a different feel then being in tourist destination.  Overall, the stay was great.  But the breakfast is fantastic and staff is even better.  They are always ready to help!",5,2018,08,20
233,Dublin Horse Show ,"I picked this accommodation due to TripAdvisor and proximity to RDS... the reviews are accurate! Old world charm, exceptional friendly service, fantastic breakfast and all around the staff make you feel welcome and at home! Would definitely stay here again.. ",5,2018,08,15
233,Wonderful breakfast!!,"Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at Ariel House. The staff members were kind and welcoming. We might have enjoyed a bit more info on sites and transportation (we just learned now that we have left that there is a DART train station nearby) - in their defense though, we didn't ask. We walked to the city centre every day - took about 30 minutes. 2 evenings, we took a taxi and it cost about 12 euros. A closer location would have been nice, but would definitely have been more expensive. The building is lovely, the room was fine. No AC which made it a bit hot at times but the weather wasn't too hot in Dublin when we were there. We are now writing this from our B&B room in Limerick which has air conditioning and I must admit, it's nice after a long day! :) Breakfast was amazing! Delicious, so many options and the serving staff members were SO kind! The little cakes and drinks in the drawing room in the afternoon were great too. We had zero problems parking. When we arrived, hungry from our flight, they offered us breakfast in our room which was awesome, worth the 20$ euros! We would highly recommend this B&B!",4,2018,08,08
233,Wonderful Dublin Accomodations,We spent 9 days at Ariel house. Everyone who worked there was just wonderful. They have a fantastic breakfast. The rooms have windows that open so you can get fresh air. It is a charming and convenient place. The dart train is a few steps away literally and can be used to get down to the Trinity College area or or take it to Connolly Station to grab the air link back to the airport. If you need anything the staff is willing to help. I highly recommend them for your stay.,5,2018,08,08
233,Brownstone B and B,"Ariel House B and B provided us with 2 nights of comfort just a short walk or brief train trek ( it rained one of the days) to inner city Dublin. The rooms were clean and spacious and fresh coffee and tea with sweets, greet arriving guests in the front parlor along with local papers and information on nearby attractions. A scrumptious breakfast was included with a sideboard of fresh fruits, pastries, breads, cold cereals and assorted juices with a variety of hot breakfasts available from the menu provided. The staff was gracious and accomodating and made our stay a very pleasant experience.",5,2018,08,06
233,Most amazing breakfast,"Beautiful guest house with lovely personal touches, coffee and tea available in the lounge all day and in the afternoon they put out complimentary home made cake and shortbread for guests.  Breakfast is incredible with a fantastic menu to choose from.  We stayed in a superior room, lovely big room.  The bathroom was awkward to get into because of the position of the door, you had to squeeze round the door to get it closed to get to the toilet/bath.  Would have been very difficult for someone bigger.  
I would love to stay there again if I was back in Dublin.",5,2018,08,06
233,Short Stay in Dublin - 5 Star Rating!,"We have stayed in lots of places in Dublin, Ariel House is now our favourite place to stay & we will be back!!  First of all we arrived very early approx 10:30 only intending to ask about leaving the car in their carpark & head into Dublin centre, but instead we were offered coffee & a sitdown for 10 mins while they prepared the room (if Arial house can sort Arial house will do it!!)
We only intended a one-night stay before moving on somewhere else, but due to location just a short walk to centre of Dublin / wonderful comfortable rooms / amazing breakfast / fantasic staff, we stayed another night!! (I think we were lucky to get staying another night as it seemed to be a full house! 
You go downstairs in the mornings and all the staff are warm and welcoming. They invite you to sit for breakfast. Throughout the afternoon, teas and coffee and cakes are available for guests in the drawing room which is a nice space for reading and resting.
Thank you for making our visit nice and comfortable. 

Paul & Roberta McCrea",5,2018,07,31
233,Large B&B with great benefits from size,"This was our first visit to Dublin and we lucked out by choosing to stay at Ariel House. This very large B&B is housed in a couple of old mansions and the benefits of its size include a lovely glass-walled conservatory-style breakfast room and a charming lobby sitting room with tea, wine and up-to-date reading materials. But the greatest benefit of a larger scale is an ever-present front of house staff managed with charm and skill by general manager Rory Doyle. The staff were attentive to our every need, including solving problems of our own making, and were ever ready to advise on our day’s activities, including making restaurant and theatre bookings. Their emphasis on customer service is reflected in the excellence of the dining, kitchen and room service staff, as well. We choose Ariel House because we wanted to be removed from the noise and action of downtown, but within walking distance. And we were hoping for trees and gardens, and maybe even birdsongs. When the taxi cab driver dropped us off he confirmed that Ariel House’s location in an area called Ballsbridge - a leafy green area where the embassies are located – was just what we were hoping for. The area is pretty and quiet and an easy, pleasant 30-minute walk to Trinity College and the Book of Kells and the heart of the great pubs, Irish shopping and literary hot spots. And, yes, we did hear birds singing. Ariel House is great value especially when considering the massive breakfast, which is included, offering delicious and varied options prepared to order. I find it hard to imagine a better place for us to stay in Dublin.",5,2018,07,29
233,"Room not good, the rest is great",The room is very basic. No air conditioning. Very gloomy looking. The service and breakfast are fantastic. Free parking was a nice perk. Lot was consistently full but they always made space for us. Location is pretty far from the downtown. ,3,2018,07,25
233,Quiet and Lovely,"We picked Ariel House due to strong reviews and particularly because the breakfast was said to be special - rated the best breakfast in Dublin by a local magazine. The hotel was just as advertised - easy to find and less than a block from the DART train, beautiful, clean, well maintained, and just lovely all around. The tea, coffee and cake served in the afternoons was a nice plus when we arrived from a long trip. The room was large and well furnished and very quiet. Although it looked into a very small garden area, and felt a bit underground (it wasn't, it was ground floor), it was perfect for us. We were rarely there, and when we were, we just wanted to sleep. The breakfast was great, but so was every other breakfast we had in Ireland, so don't go there just for that. But for a reasonably priced room in a beautiful home, it's perfect. There are also a number of good restaurants within walking distance. Yes, it's out from downtown a bit, but the commute was easy and worth it.",5,2018,07,24
233,"Wonderful, quaint charming hotel","We enjoyed our stay at Ariel House.  Location was out of the way but near train and many restaurants. Free parking.  Lovely garden and neighborhood to walk in to get a feel for living in an upscale part of the city.
Will stay again next time in Dublin.",5,2018,07,23
233,My favorite place to stay in Dublin,"After multiple trips to Dublin and stays in several hotels, Ariel House is now officially just my very favorite place to stay. This time I was there for over a week and loved every moment. Imagine waking up in a beautifully appointed room with views of a garden-- nice and quiet even though you're close to the heart of one of the greatest cities in the world. You go downstairs in the morning and all the staff are warm and welcoming. They invite you to sit for breakfast. I always sat in the solarium. They offer tea and coffee, homemade granolas and fruit compotes, homemade brown bread, and all sorts of breakfast dishes from a classic fry up to smoked salmon with potato croquettes, and pancakes with berries and creme fraiche. There is simply no nicer place in Dublin. Throughout the afternoon, teas and coffee and cakes are available for guests in the parlor, which is a nice space for reading and resting. They let me have a late check out and then leave my bags even later, without batting an eye. This place is what Irish hospitality is all about.",5,2018,07,23
233,One of the better BnB's!!,One of the better B&B that we stayed in during our trip to Ireland. Host staff were really sweet and took extra care to make the stay comfortable. Breakfast had good number of option for vegetarians & everything tasted really nice.,5,2018,07,23
233,Excellent Value,"This is a great B&B if you are visiting Dublin for multiple days and don't want to spend a fortune. No, it isn't right in the middle of things, but it is a short uber/cab ride to the city centre. There are also pubs/restaurants/markets within walking distance of the neighborhood. The front desk staff is very accommodating, and let us leave our luggage AND our rental car when we arrived on a very early flight from the U.S. The breakfast is excellent! The rooms are clean and comfortable (although a bit warm without A/C, but this seems to be typical in Ireland). We would definitely stay here again!",5,2018,07,19
233,Wonderful Bed & Breakfast in great location,We were very happy with our stay. The staff were very accommodating. The location is in the best part of town and close to everything by foot. Room was good but the outstanding feature was the breakfast which was five star.,5,2018,07,18
233,Fantastic BnB,"We only stayed at Ariel House for one night - which is a shame because it was great! From the moment we walked in we were warmly welcomed by the staff there and shown to an enormous room with four poster bed (junior suite).  The room was really comfortable and well-presented, and one slight problem was dealt with really quickly.  There is a lovely drawing room with a constant supply of tea, coffee and freshly baked goods available throughout the day.

Perhaps the greatest attribute of this establishment is the breakfast.  It would be wrong not to go for the full Irish breakfast which comes with black pudding, white pudding, potato cake and wonderful soda bread. There is a good selection of cereal, baked goods, fruits etc also.

Overall, we were delighted with Ariel House & would recommend without reservation.",5,2018,07,18
233,Fabolous ,"Stayed here for  one night. We were visiting the  embassy  and its the perfect location  as it a couple minutes walk away. Right beside Aviva stadium and the dart. Great location great rates. Loved this place. Rooms are spotless, breakfast was excellent  and staff are lovely  especially Cecilia, she's so helpful and friendly.  Lovely bar (Slatterys)just  a couple minutes walk  and also some restaurants nearby. Would definitely recommend this place ",5,2018,07,18
233,So Comforting ,"Can’t rave enough about Ariel House. First, prior to our visit, we emailed a number of times about changes we required aa well as inquiries about the best way to get to hotel from airport (AirCoach €8.5).  They promptly and pleasantly responded which we appreciated. When our adult daughter chose to join us for a few days, they changed our room without an additional charge. 

This speaks to the service here which is superb.  The reception is so pleasant and welcoming. After a long travel day we arrived early morning to drop our bags. After apologizing for the room not being reading ( at 8:00 am?!) they invited us to have breakfast on them ( a 2 x €15 value). Wow. The breakfast is worth staying here alone. Fresh baked goodies are amazing. Warm scones, pane au chocolate, and toasted multi grain bread are all wonderful. 

Start on the buffet with baked goods, cheeses, juices, granola yoghurt and more. Choice of one starter (I loved the fruit parfait) and one main. I tried them all; eggs with smoked salmon, pancakes, beautiful brioche French toast and an Irish Full Breakfast. So good and so filing. 

Again here the staff are very good and accommodating.

They have a modest afternoon tea consisting of tea, coffee and lemonade with a little bit of white cake or cookies. Nice if you are around but not worth coming back to the hotel specifically for it. 

We are walkers, so we did not mind walking 25 minutes to get to the action (40 minutes to Temple Bar) but the hotel is just 3 minutes from the Landsdowne DART station which connects you to all the modes     of Dublin’s excellent transit options (buses, street cars, rail). 

Don’t want to forget that the beds were very comfy and the rooms ( and area) very quiet. 

We loved this choice, and so will you. 

",5,2018,07,17
233,CONCERT IN RDS.,"I stayed in Ariel House on the 13th July as was attending Paul Simon concert in the RDS. I was overwhelmed by the standard of this accommodation.It is a true Gem in the hospitality sector. The breakfast was five star, the staff were so friendly and helpful, the room was mega comfortable. I loved the lounge with complimentary tea/ coffee/scones/daily papers and chill out time.Pure relaxation on tap.I have recommended this Guesthouse to my friends and will certainly return. ",5,2018,07,16
233,Great experience... wish we’d had longer,"We stayed in a lovely family room, upstairs in the main houses. 

What a great experience. A car park was made available, our bags were taken up for us, afternoon tea served and breakfast was really very good.  Rory is a great host. 

We booked for an overnight stay before we departed Dublin to begin our trek back to NZ.  Wish we had known better and stayed a couple of nights!",5,2018,07,16
233,Fantastic Guest House,"We booked for two based on trip advisor reviews. It lived up to expectations, and they deserve all five stars for being so gracious and accomodating. The staff was available around the clock for questions and concerns, and they bent over backwards to find car parking for us to avoid a ticket. Very nice spacious rooms. Pleasant and filling breakfast in beautiful dining room. Less than 5 min walk to the Lansdowne Rd station which is only 2 stops from Pearse St. which is about as close to the center of everything in Dublin as you could hope for. Would stay here again with a group any day!",5,2018,07,16
233,Just perfect.....,"Fantastic weekend in Dublin to see Michael Bublé made all the more perfect by our experience at Ariel House. Lovely welcome and coffee and instant access to our room late morning as it was available. Lovely to be given an upgrade to the Junior Suite as it was my birthday - greatly appreciated! Fantastic location being two minutes from the DART and then only a few minutes to the Temple Bar area. Just the best breakfast ever to set you up for the day and every member of staff we met made us feel welcome. Again, excellent service arranging a taxi back to the airport. Wonderful stay and we will be back!",5,2018,07,14
233,Nice place with decent location,"We had a nice stay at the Ariel House. Good location not too far from city center and a lovely house. The rooms were HOT - no AC and warm temps in Ireland meant that we were largely roasting in our rooms, which mean poor sleep. Good breakfast and helpful staff.",4,2018,07,10
233,Better for small people who don’t get up early,"After reading the reviews for our trip to Dublin, I was excited to stay at the Ariel House. My husband and I are foodies and the descriptions and images looked quaint. The accommodations are quaint and the staff was very kind; however, if you are tall or muscley or big in general, you may find the accommodations a bit snug - specifically the bed, which we both found to be quite uncomfortable.

We also learned that since we booked early morning Wild Rover tours that had us leaving at 6:00 or 7:00 am, we couldn’t experience the buffet breakfast that was one of the reasons we’d booked this hotel in the first place. We were given a continental breakfast but that was disappointing.

The Ariel House is within walking distance of a delicious restaurant called the Chophouse. Nearby food does not actually show up on maps so if you’re in your room wondering if there’s food, there is. We also found that Four Star Pizza will deliver and its delicious.

Next time, we will get a hotel that is closer to transportation and diverse food options, especially given how we chose to use our time while in Dublin. If you’re a smaller person who enjoys a firm mattress, who wants a B&B feel - a quaint hotel on a quiet street - and you can wait to eat until 7:30 am, this is just the place for you.",3,2018,07,05
233,"Great value, excellent location, and lucky with our room assignment","This is a very good value hotel.   The hotel is housed in buildings built in 1851.   The location in the Ballsbridge (the embassy district) section of Dublin is removed from the craziness of central Dublin.   The hotel is less than 100 yards from the Lansdowne Road train station, making public transportation convenient.   Breakfast at the hotel was excellent.   

My family was fortunate during our recent stay at Ariel House in that we had rooms on the lowest level with north-facing windows.   The heat wave in all of Ireland made the hotel hot; there's no air conditioning.   I don't know how guests on the top floors of the hotel, especially on the southside of the building, got any sleep in the heat.",4,2018,07,05
233,Absolutely Lovely,"Ariel house is beautiful and incredibly charming. The staff was so friendly and kind, and the room was gorgeous, spacious, and clean. They will serve you tea in the drawing room in the afternoons, and serve a lovely breakfast as well. I would definitely stay here again when visiting Dublin.",5,2018,07,04
233,Another lovely time at Arial House,"Although we only spent one night at Arial House, it was a great experience.  Cecilia was fabulous and made us feel so welcome!   She really works to be personable and get to know the guests.  The breakfast was delicious and so much to select from!  Arial House is located in the beautiful part of Dublin known as Ballsbridge and we love to walk to Merion Square and see the homes in the area that feature those wonderful ""doors of Ireland"".",5,2018,07,01
233,"Incredibly helpful staff, lovely hotel","We arrived in Dublin thinking we had a reservation for a junior suite at Ariel House, but due to a mistake I made on booking dates, we actually didn't. Jilly at reception made the most remarkable effort to find us a room, which was one of their normal ensuite ones, and we only paid that rate, not the more expensive one I had booked. She also tried very hard to accommodate us for our actual stay in Dublin, but as they were fully-booked on one of the nights, we opted to move to a nearby hotel.
Breakfast was excellent, with cold food available on a buffet and hot choices from a menu. The sitting/living room was wonderfully comfortable, with tea, coffee and cake every afternoon. The hotel itself is less than a block away from the DART rail line with frequent service into Dublin city center and the suburbs.
Despite my mistake Jilly and Rory treated us like VIP clients, carrying and storing our luggage and ensuring that the one night we did stay was outstanding. I would give Ariel House more stars if Tripadvisor allowed it.",5,2018,07,01
233,Wonderful stay!  Irish hospitality at its best!,"My husband and I stayed the weekend of June 23.  The hotel was lovely and perfect location for our visit!  The rooms were clean, the staff very friendly and they went above and beyond.  The breakfast was delicious- best scones I ever had, they even gave me the recipe!  I would highly recommend the Ariel house for any stay in Dublin!",5,2018,06,28
233,Convenient and Cosy,"We only stayed one night but the hotel was perfect for what we needed, only a 10 minute walk to the RDS and extremely friendly and helpful staff. The room was beautifully appointed and much larger than expected and the breakfast was fantastic with a large range of options. The one downside was the lack of accessibility to the sockets in the rooms as I had to move the locker to access them but this was only a small thing and very understandable considering the age of the building. All in all an extremely pleasant stay and I would definitely return again.",5,2018,06,28
233,My idea of a home from home,"This is my idea of what a perfect town house hotel should be. The location is spot-on for concerts at Aviva stadium (Lansdowne road). The house itself is elegant without being too ""upper class"". Clientele were normal folks like us - we dislike places that make you feel under-dressed especially when on holiday. Front of house staff are well-trained and seem genuinely happy in their work even when rushed off their feet. We stayed 2 nights. The Saturday night was fully-booked (due to Billy Joel concert) which tested the breakfast team on Sunday morning which is one of few negatives. We had to wait in the drawing room almost one-hour for breakfast- I wondered why they couldn't either lay tables up in that room to cope with the inevitable busy morning breakfast service or allocate/give guests a choice of 8am-9am or 10am-11am seating.  We would've been happy to choose a time rather than wait around. Breakfast was definitely worth waiting for though- enjoyed the hot choices and the buffet dresser.
Lemonade , cake or shortbread and tea are available afternoons in the drawing room- possibly only aimed at newly arriving guests but plenty of already checked-in guests availed themselves of the facility which was a big plus -AH should definitely keep offering this, it puts them ahead of competing establishments. The drawing room was under used in the evening on our visit (maybe everyone is out on the town at night). We ate at the wonderful Chop House a close walk away on Friday evening- but enjoyed sitting reading the papers in Ariel House drawing room later in the evening on the first night and then we sat watching the buzz of activity surrounding the departing concert goers streaming by on the second evening. I don't hesitate giving this hotel an excellent for my review however it's a real shame the garden rooms do not have completely opening, nor step outside style windows as the weather was conducive to being outside while we visited and the garden was maintained and pretty. Before we booked I didn't read anywhere that garden rooms are not ground floor in the true sense and that you need to navigate two flights of stairs to reach them- a disappointment for me after already climbing a flight ""up"" to the front door then two down to my room- I just presumed garden would be on an easy to navigate level (ground floor). On the first day I slipped badly either due to a slight incline or to the slightly rippled carpet in the rear hallway- two staff came to my rescue but 4 days later my toe is still black and my leg bruised as it folded under me- I have never fallen over before so it was a shock for which I'll blame myself but next time I might choose a differently located room if available. Parking on site is a huge plus. I also liked the fact there are not heaps of cards, leaflets or signs in the bedrooms and bathroom (my pet hate in hotels so well done AH ). If I'm being picky I'd like a super-king or king bed, a double is not special enough and I go away to be spoiled not to have less than I have at home. Room staff neglected to leave us any milk pots on day two so that's our excuse for having tea in the drawing room on our second day if we need one. All told we will return.",5,2018,06,26
233,Second visit and as good as ever if not better,"We choose to stay at Ariel House for the second time and were not disappointed.  The location is excellent for the centre of Dublin with the Dart a couple of minutes walk.
We were warmly welcomed and looked after with a welcoming pot of tea and cake by the Manager, Mr Rory Doyle, who proved to be very helpful in all matters including recommendations for restaurants and attractions.
The beds are comfortable and as all will say, the breakfast is outstanding ( I forgot to ask for their bread receipt).
Will definitely visit again and highly recommend.",5,2018,06,20
233,Hidden Gem,"This place is brilliant. Big rooms, Great service, friendly welcome and the breakfast was the best breakfast I have ever had. Very close to the dart (2 minutes) and 10 minute walk into Ballsbridge.I would highly recommend",5,2018,06,18
233,Great room and service,"I chose Ariel House after reading the positive reviews and I wasn’t disappointed. We arrived fairly late at night and received a warm welcome. Although a small guest house, there is 24 hour check in. Our room was very large and nicely furnished, with a nice ensuite. Breakfast was excellent, with a good selection. The staff are very friendly and the afternoon tea and lounge area for guests was very welcomed.

Ariel House is a little out of the centre of Dublin, but within a reasonable walking distance of all the attractions. Parking is available and there is good Wifi. Ariel House is also well-priced. The staff provided great advice on places to eat and directions to take. Highly recommended.",5,2018,06,13
233,First class place to stay in Dublin,"What a great place to stay in Dublin! A little bit outside the city center, it's in a series of Georgian townhouses. The rooms reflect the period but offer modern amenities. We had a fabulous huge room overlooking the garden. The staff could not have been more helpful;.  Best of all,  the DART is a 3 minute walk away and within 7 minutes you are in the city center so you can have the best of both worlds staying in Dublin-- a lovely quiet neighborhood and easy access to all the sights.",5,2018,06,10
233,unexpected,"where do i start?  (1) Twenty steps up from the street.  (2) Hot day in Dublin, no 
AC and the window was screwed shut - room unbearable hot (they brought in a fan) (3) they made a dinner reservation for me that wasn't what i expected (4) toilet flushed about 1/2 the time (5) sink was slow to drain.   And I have not even gone to bed yet.  And the price was way more than it was worth.  Find another place.",2,2018,06,07
233,Amazing place,"We stayed here for our honeymoon last week.  I rang ahead to ask if they did any packages to be told ‘we will look after you’ and boy they did!!! We had the beautiful James Joyce suite for the week which in its self made our honeymoon.  Lovely room, large, clean, comfy four poster bed and a sitting area with views onto the front garden.

The friendliness and welcome of the staff (esp Rory and Cecillia) was first class nothing was too much trouble, and the card and present of chocolates was a lovely touch. The hug as we were going felt like we were leaving friends.

The breakfasts were gorgeous served quickly and efficiently again with lovely staff.  

We can’t recommend this lovely hotel enough.  Thankyou!

Julie and simon ",5,2018,06,05
233,Another first class visit,"We recently had our 5th visit to the Ariel House. We love the feel of the stately home and the welcome they always give us. Nothing is too much trouble. The afternoon tea, coffee and cakes are always a welcome sight after a long day in the city. The breakfast is perfection and they always pack us a ""to go"" breakfast when we check out for our early flight home.",5,2018,05,29
233,Good place to stay but with a few faults,"Stayed 2 nights at the end of our 11 day trip of mainly Northern Ireland with final stay in Dublin. The guest house is located in a wealthier part of town with rows of lovely brownstones. The location waa fine for us - about 25-30 min walk to the temple bar area, 55 minutes to the guinness storehouse. We are both athletic and enjoy walking (we walked 165km during our trip in total) so this was really no issue for us and walked back and forth even twice in the same day. The trai  station is just a block away in case walking isnt your thing. Our room was on the ground floor (and quite dark) and though we had booked a superior room, we felt it wasnt so superior but for the price in Dublin, it was alright for us. The bathroom was basic and cold at night. We didnt like the very creaky floors above us which mean everytime the people above us moved, we could hear it loud and clear. The breakfast was very very good - the best we had during our trip. We loved a rhubab compote they had made with yogurt. We also thought the menu to order additional items was excellent and catered also healthy options. Fantastic! We also thought the coffee and cakes in the study was a nice touch. The staff is friendly and very helpful. Got a recommendation for lunch upon arrival and they also called to see if space was available. 
All in all, a great place to stay and would recommend it. The rooms on the higher floors seemed quite pricey and we didnt spend much time in the room anyway.",4,2018,05,29
233,Lovely Stay & Amazing Staff,"We stayed here for one night at beginning and end of our stay in Ireland.  Ariel is located in a wonderful neighborhood within easy walking distance of several great restaurants.  It is probably a 20-30 minute walk into the center of town, but that was not a problem for us, and there is a Dart and bus stops right down the street. 
 Breakfast is served in a sunroom with a variety of hot and cold choices including full Irish breakfast.  Service is fast, and food was great.  It is an older hotel, and no stairs, but that was not an issue for us.   The staff was warm and welcoming.  We'd definitely return.",5,2018,05,26
233,Outstanding B&B,"Stayed here for 2 nights upon arrival from England. Sometimes B&B feel like you are in someone's home.  While this had the charm of a B&B it really is a professionally run hotel-type accommodation.  I mean this in a positive way.  We had a twin room garden view.  The room was very large and had 2 double (or maybe queen) size beds and a large bathroom with tub.  Everything was so clean.  The breakfasts were top notch. Others have elaborated but both selection, quality, and service was outstanding.  We were able to park for free in the lot.  It did take us about 30 minutes to walk into the town central.  The second day we took the dart which can be picked up about 1/2 block from Ariel House. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",5,2018,05,23
233,Lovely stay at beginning and end of an Icelandic cruise,"From the time we began planning our 10-night cruise to Iceland, we knew that we would need a pre- and post- hotel stay in Dublin.  Based on the reviews and, quite frankly, the cost of other hotels in Dublin, we decided that Ariel House was our choice.  The cost of City Center hotels are outrageous and Ariel House offers so much more at a much more reasonable price.

This lovely B&B is in an easy to navigate area of Dublin with DART transportation no more that 3 minutes away.  Our rooms were different for each of our two nights there since they were 10 nights apart.  Each was comfortable, but the standard guest room is considerably smaller, so you might think about requesting a suite. Our post-night stay was in the Jonathan Swift suite and it was lovely and very comfortable.

Breakfasts were well-done and the staff was very pleasant and accommodating.  Our only real concern was that there were many steps to enter the house and then multiple levels of stairs for all the rooms.  Although the staff was always willing to help with luggage, it was really something that did present a few problems for us since I am an over packer and our suitcases were many and heavy!  

We met lovely people in the parlor over morning and afternoon tea and enjoyed the great cakes and cookies. 

Another of the great perks was that the Dublin Chauffeurs service was recommended on the Ariel House website.  I used the services of Justin and his team for our trips to and from the airport and to and from the cruise port.  He was absolutely wonderful and reliable and I can’t say enough about how comfortable we were to work with him in connection to our stay at Ariel House.  

We’d highly recommend Ariel House for your Dublin stay!",5,2018,05,23
233,Victorian style with classic touches,"We enjoyed two nights at Ariel after road tripping throughout Ireland for three weeks.  The hotel is located in a wonderful neighborhood, quiet and not touristy.  The staff was pleasant and helpful.  The breakfast was extensive in a lovely sunroom with hot entree options.  Our room was not quite what we expected, but was still very nice.  By that I mean, we requested a garden view double and received a parking lot room with two double beds.  It was appointed nicely and was spacious.  However, for privacy you had to keep the drapes closed.  The bathroom was large with a modern shower and tub combo.  The rating would have been a five, except for the room issue and the lack of a lift.  The stairs into the hotel are steep and then to reach our room, we had two more staircases.  Yes, the staff assisted with the luggage, but the stairs were a bit harsh on the knees.  It was probably my error for not checking in advance, but due to the reviews I just thought the lift wouldn't be an issue,  That being said, we still recommend the Ariel. House for a lovely stay in Dublin.  It was easy to get around, plus was within walking distances to great restaurants!",4,2018,05,21
233,So Great!,"This was our first place to stay in Ireland, and what an amazing introduction. The staff was incredibly nice and helpful. Our room was beautiful and comfortable. We had the most comfortable bed ever at an accommodation. 
Breakfast was absolutely delicious, with a full breakfast menu and also buffet options. I will recommend the Ariel House to anyone traveling to Dublin. ",5,2018,05,20
233,"location, breakfast","We spent 4 nights and were close transportation and the major sites, one morning we had an early tour so they packed us a breakfast to go.3 mornings we had breakfast in the breakfast room and it was better than good more like fantastic.Tea and coffee plus cakes every late afternoon.Everyone made us feel like we were at homemade arrangements for anything we needed.Thanks for a lovely time in Ireland",5,2018,05,17
233,Excellent base for exploring Dublin,"We stayed for a week. The rooms were great and the breakfast is amazing. Over the six days I worked my way through the cooked menu and they were all great. Free tea, coffee and cake is available in the very elegant lounge throughout the day.is very welcome. For exploring Dublin use the Dart train (50 yards from the hotel). It is best to get the 3 day visitor leap card which saves buying tickets.",5,2018,05,14
233,Excellent start to our holiday ,"We stayed here for our first three nights in Ireland. It is very conveniently situated for the Dart train which takes you quickly right into the centre of Dublin.
The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and on one wet afternoon we were grateful to shelter in the lounge with a nice warm cup of tea and a couple of small cakes.
The ambiance of the place is just right. ",5,2018,05,13
233,Oasis,"Booked into this lovely spot away from the hubbub but close enough to everything.
Arrived way too early in the morning to start a two week adventure after overnight transatlantic hop and horrible rental care experience at the airport to be met by smiles and a warm welcome second to none.
Cecilia made it tolerable with her wit and charm and fed us a proper breakfast and got us into our well appointed room for a quick nap and fabulous day out on the town.
Close to the port and the beginning of our adventure the ferry to Wales.
After our whirlwind from the ferry to Wales, up through the Yorkshire, Northumberland, Edinburgh, Girvan, and the ferry to Belfast we arrived back to the Ariel House for our last night in Ireland.
Cecilia was awaiting for our stories and her warmth which made it all worthwhile.
Can't thank all the folks at the House for making us feel comfortable and more like family then guests!",5,2018,05,13
233,A quaint lovely place to stay,Our first day in Dublin and we stayed at the Ariel house on the bed and breakfast rate. So glad that I booked this quaint little hotel in a quiet residential area. It is just far enough away from the hub of Dublin but within walking distance of downtown and most attractions. The breakfast was incredible as was all the food in Ireland. The front desk managers were so friendly and helpful and gave us suggestions s on where to have supper. Would recommend it to everyone and would stay again.,5,2018,05,12
233,Perfection! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,We spent 2 lovely nights here. Beautiful location & good walking distance to the city. The home was very warm and welcoming. There was a nice tray of desserts with coffee or tea available at any time in the main parlor. Our room was impeccable and quite lovely. Bathroom was a good size with a great shower. Beds were divine! Everyone was very friendly and ready to help with anything we may have needed. Breakfast was delicious and exceeded our expectations. Nice variety of options. I would definitely recommend this lovely B&B!,5,2018,05,08
233,Great hospitality,"We stayed here for 2 nights upon arrival to Ireland. The staff is fantastic and they were able to get us into our rooms way before check-in time. The rooms were gorgeous and the breakfasts were terrific. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the room thermostats/temperature is centrally controlled and not individual to the rooms so we had to open the windows at night because it was so hot. In addition, the Ariel house is on the outskirts of the city so we either had to take a cab or train into town, although the train station is steps from the hotel. But, that is the struggle with visiting big cities. With that being said, I would stay here again if I couldn’t find a place in the city with parking. Thanks to everyone at the Ariel house, your staff was the most friendly out of every place we have stayed in Ireland. ",4,2018,05,08
233,Great Stay!,"We stayed here for two nights over a weekend. Everything was excellent. Good reception staff, perfect room, very good breakfast options. Location a a good area. Easily located to walk into the centre.  The reason for four stars was the price. Then again Dublin is an expensive city. Would stay here again with a discount.",4,2018,05,05
233,Brilliant!!,"We went to Dublin with 5 couples for 4 nights. My mother was from Ireland and I have visited many times. This stay rates as one of the very best.
Why? Well, Cecilia and Rory are the Queen and King of Failte (welcome), tea in the cozy parlour, the most comfortable bed ever, great location and a real taste of Irish hospitality. Oh, and the price? A steal!!
Ariel House is my place to stay in Dublin full stop!",5,2018,05,03
233,Sorry we couldn't stay for breakfast,"After a few days driving around the west and south of Ireland, we arrived at Ariel House for a single night before our early morning flight back to the States. Our brief contact with the staff was very pleasant and so was the room. It had the expected modern conveniences such as TV, wi-fi, and outlets to charge our phones without seeming like a sterile modern hotel.  After reading the accounts of breakfast, I wish we could have stayed to have some, but we had to leave well before dawn.",5,2018,04,17
233,Top class B&B in a great location,"Nothing negative to say. Top class B&B. Warm, clean, very comfortable, great character and a beautiful breakfast.

The property is in a perfect location in the nicest part of Dublin and is right beside the soccer / rugby stadium. The rooms are cosy and spotlessly clean (some of the cleanest rooms I have ever seen). Staff are very professional, friendly and helpful. Couldn't ask for more. 

Breakfast is absolutely top class. As good as you would get anywhere.",5,2018,04,17
233,Fantastic stay......,"After traveling all night from the US to Dublin, 1 1/2 hours to get our vehicle, getting severly lost trying to find the Hotel (which is a story in of itself), we finally arrived at the Ariel House.  Rori who was at the front desk upon our arrival immedialtey recognized that both my wife and I were extremly tired, stressed and frustrated..  After getting situated, Rori took it upon himself to upgrade us a larger room and WOW was it amazing.  He also provided several suggestions on where to eat and unwind, which were all excellent.  The following morning we were greeted with the most amazing breakfast that we experienced on our entire trip.  It's a bit of a walk to the Town Centre, but oh so worth it.  Don't miss this gem.",5,2018,04,09
233,Lucky to stay in such a wonderful hotel,"I loved this place, a real bit of old fashioned hospitality. We were looked after a wonderful lady who must have worked some very long hours as she was always ready to help us in lots of ways. Our room was brilliant, the two double beds made our stay very easy with our young daughter. Breakfast! superb! wowsers, ate like a king....",5,2018,04,06
233,"Brilliant B&B, 10/10","Really surprised to see the recent complaint from across the pond. I stayed here last weekend and had a very different experience. 

Maybe it's different in America, but during the 1800's people didn't build large town houses with a car park suitable for 300 spaces. 

When we booked there were warnings about the parking, and the rugby ground hotel makes no secret of the location. As a guest I found this to be no issue, as we had all the information beforehand and could plan accordingly.

As a side note we were in the hotel when the rugby was on and didn't hear a thing. It was lovely to stay somewhere with real character, rather than a soul-less Premier Inn style out of town establishment.  

The hotel was luxurious. As with all big old properties there is clearly ongoing upkeep which the management are keeping on top of. The decoration and furnishings were in keeping with the style of the property, and made for a very relaxing stay. It was also a comfortably warm temperature. Nothing worse than a cold hotel.

Our room was beautiful. Warm, spacious, huge bed turned down and lamps on, kitted out with tea, coffee, glasses for tap water and the en suite had plenty of towels, soap, shampoo etc.

After a lovely night's sleep we got up and went to the breakfast. If I lived in Dublin I'd be trying to get a voluntary position at Arial house just so they could show me how to make all their breakfast wonders. The staff were really friendly and accommodating. 

***Spoiler alert, don't read this if you want a surprise breakfast*** During my stay I had an Irish breakfast (amazing black pudding), Herby scrambled eggs (goes lovely with the fancy chutney), pancakes with bacon (nice but very filling!) And then poached eggs and bacon (perfectly poached fresh eggs). Everything was brilliant. Also the fresh brown bread, banana bread and peaches were delicious. ******

On the afternoon of the Rugby Match (big game with the local team), the surrounding roads were closed when the spectators arrived and left, which did make things much safer for the people. 

My partner and I had been walking in Bray and fancied a rest before our evening meal and I had a really relaxing few hours sat by the bay windows reading my book, listening to lovely background music and eating delicious biscuits and cakes.

This is a brilliant little B&B which has character. There are precious few of these left and going just reminded me how much nicer they are than the big chains. Definitely recommend it for anyone looking for someone to stay in Dublin, it's nice to get away from the centre. 

Oh and we really liked Bloom Bistro nearby and the pub just past the Ballsbridge hotel, there are three in a row and we went into the end one. Just a tip if you're staying and fancy a Guinness :)",5,2018,04,04
233,"Comfy, clean & delicious breakfast ","Stayed the night of April 3. Check in was friendly and efficient. Room was comfy and clean, though the chairs were a bit worn. As would be expected in an old building there was a bit of sound coming from upstairs and the next room but nothing intolerable. Breakfast was divine, and plentiful! Will definitely return. ",4,2018,04,04
233,No Parking,"The Ariel House has 37 rooms and 12 parking places. It was complete chaos at check in on a Sunday afternoon. There was no one to help with bags for my elderly mother and aunt since the one staff member on duty was running around trying to direct traffic, unfortunately there was no where for the guests to park cars and no where to direct them.
This hotel is DIRECTLY next to the AVIVA STADIUM and when there are games ALL STREETS AROUND THE HOTEL ARE BLOCKED OFF AND CLOSED FOR MOST OF THE DAY. Plan ahead.
I found the staff to be arrogant and unfriendly. They do not have umbrellas to lend, they do not provide drinking water in the rooms, they do not replace wet towels.
The furniture is terribly worn to the point that there are no longer pulls on some of the drawers and cannot be opened. The mattress is extremely worn and uncomfortable.
The one nice thing was breakfast with friendly servers.",2,2018,04,02
233,"Lovely, friendly hotel","My mother and I had a quick stay on St Patrick's day. The hotel receptionist that checked us in was very nice and welcoming. Our room was very nice, clean and decorated to a high standard. Breakfast in the morning was spectacular. Would definitely return. ",5,2018,04,02
233,Sight seeing Dublin,"What a perfect B&B!
The location is south of the main city centre. But serviced on its door step by the Dart and many buses, including the Air coach from the airport. 
It is a splendid large Victorian house or actually two joined together. The rooms are large, warm and clean.
The breakfast is amazing! Which I'd truly an understatement. Everything is so fresh and tastes wonderful. You have a massive choice and everything tried was great.
The staff are very friendly and helpful.
There is complementary tea and cake in the lounge in the afternoon and the papers were always available to read.
The B&B is located adjacent to the rugby ground which is a winner for any rugby fans. Ballsbridge bars and restaurants are only 5 mins walk.
We found it the best priced place in the area. The quality was worth every penny. Would definitely return without looking for any where else.
Thank you for a great stay.",4,2018,04,01
233,Wonderful Experience,"During a 9 day trip throughout Ireland, we stayed at Ariel 2 times, 2 nights each.  Staff is overly accommodating, making sure that you are comfortable in their 'home.  Rooms are decorated with period furniture, the house itself is a mansion that has been very nicely repurposed.  Most importantly--the BEDS are Luxurious.  Won't miss a wink of sleep here.  Breakfast included, is a plus, with a menu to choose from that includes the traditional ""Irish Breakfast"".   We left very early our last day, so staff made sure we had a 'to go' breakfast --classy move.  Located a 2 minute walk to 'Dart' to get downtown, or walk 10 minutes to Ballsbridge for Pubs.  Can't recommend it enough--we will certainly return on next visit to Dublin.",5,2018,03,19
233,Amazing place to stay,I have stayed in Ariel house twice and I must say the staff are lovely the house is stunning the location is excellent their breakfast is super. The last time I stayed they upgraded our room which was really nice. Overall it’s a ten out of ten. ,5,2018,03,17
233,The best hotel I've been in-,"Great hotel in Dublin. Great price,  Fantastic and beautiful room, great staff, very good value for your money. Highly recommended !!! 
Breakfast was amazing and was included in the price.  One day we took an early tour before breakfast and the staff offered us take away bags with breakfast.",5,2018,03,17
233,Business and pleasure,"I combined a business trip with a brief holiday with my wife. The welcome we received and the initial appearance of the room were both first rate. A slight disappointment was that the shower was very difficult to adjust, and even getting warm water from the tap was difficult. The breakfast was reasonably good, if you wanted a full breakfast, but the continental buffet could have been better: fruit wasn’t apparent, and the homemade brown bread was incredibly heavy. Otherwise the room was pleasant with a very comfortable bed.",4,2018,03,16
233,The best by far,Ariel House was a lovely surprise and I am so glad we could experience the delightful charm of this guesthouse. Our room overlooked the garden and was quiet and graciously furnished. The manager and staff was ever so helpful to make us feel spoiled and at home. Breakfast was excellent,5,2018,03,03
233,"Lovely place, lovely people",This is my favorite hotel in Dublin and my first choice when I'm in town. The breakfast is the best and the staff is awesome and helpful. The cosy tea room completes the picture of a welcoming place. My rating is 5+ of 5 ,5,2018,03,01
233,"Great stay, welcoming staff, superb breakfast","We have a room out the back, which we like as it is quiet. On a cold night I really appreciated the bath and enjoyed a warming soak. Our room has a double bed and a single combo which isn't the best option. The bed is super comfy but not super big and the bed does a lot of creaking and groaning every time we move. Net result is we end up having a bed each. That said, the doona is a perfect weight (not too heavy) and the bed provides a great nights' sleep. Breakfast is a real treat and the porridge with fruit and cinnamon is divine. Followed by potato cakes and smoked salmon. Fresh, beautifully served, way at the top of the list when it comes to breakfasts. Great staff also. Excellent stay in terms of comfort and all round quality. Bit of a walk from town but the train is just down the road. We really enjoyed the walk as it is interesting and there are plenty of stops on the way if you want to recuperate!",5,2018,02,24
233,Wonderful ,"Small cosy well appointed hotel. Situated in the south of Dublin very close to the Lansdowne Road DART station and the Aviva Stadium. Rooms are clean, well equipped, traditional and comfortable. Staff are wonderful, pleasant, engaging and attentive. The hotel provides a drawing room at the entrance of the hotel providing tea, coffee and cakes and the opportunity to relax and read the daily newspaper (complimentary). Breakfast is served in a conservatory overlooking the gardens. A wide selection available from the buffet and the hot selection. Full Irish with a poached egg, bacon, sausage, black and white pudding, potato cake, vine tomatoes and mushrooms. There are many other hot options available including scrambled eggs with smoked salmon. All the tea and coffee you want, toast (brown and white) all served freshly cooked and piping hot. The staff at breakfast were lovely,  nothing was any trouble.  The hotel has a very warm welcoming atmosphere and the surroundings and staff certainly reflect the understated class of the property. 30 minutes walk from the city centre or 10 minutes on the DART. Will definitely return, highly recommended. ",5,2018,02,11
233,Comfortable ,"Just spent the weekend here because of the great location for the Aviva Stadium 200 m away. Very helpful  staff, lovely clean rooms, fab breakfast, free hot drinks and nice cake made this a very pleasant stay. ",5,2018,02,11
233,Great breakfast,Lovely place near of the city center. Great for ă city break. Excellent breakfast ă la carte. The staff was very nice and warm. Cosy place ! You feel just like home. We'll come back for sure ! Lots of thanks to the manager!,5,2018,02,10
233,So glad I chose Ariel House for my recent visit to Dublin!,"From check in to check out the staff went above and beyond to provide excellent service - this was the highlight for us!!
The room was large and bed very comfortable. Gorgeous drawing room available for use with tea/coffee & cake offered in afternoon. Breakfast in the morning was delicious and definitely above normal hotel breakfast fare. Lovely location in quiet area - walking distance to good restaurants and pubs. Would 100% recommend.",5,2018,02,07
233,Short trip to Dublin,Stayed in the above accomadation last night in one of the family room overlooking the aviva stadium. A lovely place to stay in a very well kept facility. I believe the two house to be georgian in style. Lovely high ceilings and comfort. Great service and a excellent breakfast. Two very little points. Carparking very tight and limited. Secondly close to main train line with some noise but slept very well. Would stay again. Thank you,5,2018,02,06
233,Comfortable stay,"Ariel House is madeout of three Victorian town houses that have been converted into a comfortable guest house/small hotel. They are the last in a row of more or less identical townhouses along the north side of Lansdowne Road, right next to the national arena Aviva Stadium and Lansdowne Road DART station. The rooms are well appointed and there is a nice traditional drawing room to relax in downstairs. The breakfast is good value with a buffet combined with a selection of hot dishes to order. I guess the only drawback for us was the location about a 30 minute walk from Dublin’s center. There are some places to eat and drink more nearby, many of them in the Grand Canal area. The famous Presto Chipper (take-out only) and Slattery’s Pub are just a couple of blocks away.",4,2018,02,05
233,Is this the best B&B in Dublin?,"Wonderful building. Great location. Walking distance of range of restaurants. Really comfortable beds and pillow. Mega breakfast - includes freshly made bread. 
Friendly staff. Tea and cake in sitting room. 
Highest recommendation. ",5,2018,01,30
233,Nothing to complain about!,"Stayed here for two nights on a girly weekend.  Great b&b in a fantastic location with the train stop nearby.  Staff very friendly and go out of their way to help. Lovely breakfast, clean rooms. Would definitely return! 

",5,2018,01,28
233,City centre location,"Hotel with great location in the city centre!! 

Spotlessly clean rooms, large room with a  very comfortable bed. Breakfast was great, gluten free options available!! 

Great value, would happily stay here again!! ",5,2018,01,23
233,Excellent Band B,"This was a lovely welcoming B and B on a quiet road off the main road adjacent to the light rail service. The room , lounge and dining room was excellent. Lovely people on reception took care of all our needs on arrival, with advise and suggestions of places to see and do . Very close in walking distance to good Irish and other cuisine eateries",5,2018,01,02
233,Nice,"Breakfast was excellent and the service was always efficient and polite. The hotel was clean and only 15 mins taxi ride from the city center. If you are looking for good rooms on a quiet street, friendly, helpful staff, good access to DART, we would recommend staying at Ariel House.",4,2017,12,30
233,Dublin classic,"We have stayed three times now at Ariel House over almost a 20 year period. We keep coming back for the excellent service, accommodation, and breakfast. This time we splurged a bit and had the James Joyce room. Great place to sit and watch the world go by. The room was very large and comfortable too. If you love antiques and large breakfasts, this is the place for you!",5,2017,12,30
233,Needed to change room,"We were given a room on the ground floor which felt like the basement perhaps because the grand entrance is on the floor above. The room was rather small and gloomy. We could have survived, but it was permeated with a smell of stale tobacco. There were ""no smoking"" signs on most doors but not ours. The management did not agree on the smell, pointing to their no smoking policy. Nevertheless, they gave us another room, also on the ground floor. It was bigger though still rather gloomy. We slept well enough. The staff were attentive and the breakfast was excellent.",3,2017,12,25
233,Accommodating home away from home,"From the warmest of welcomes upon our arrival to the arrangement for our trip to the airport during our farewell, the staff at Ariel House were always available. The rooms were cozy and fully appointed.  Tea and sweets, as well as reading material were readily available in the beautiful drawing room. The breakfast menu was gorgeous.",5,2017,12,19
233,Mary D,"Ariel house has become my second home. The warm welcome from friendly Ariel team, the fabulous food, roomy accommodation- all lead to a 5* review, and this comes from someone who never writes a review!!!! A secret haven in the heart of dublin. Ariel house is placed in the ideal location for long and short stay guests - Grafton street is only s short walk away!!. I love, love, love it!!!  Thank you Ariel house for helping me to call Dublin my second home!!! Mary D😄☘️",5,2017,12,15
233,Lovely Hotel around Christmas ,Just stayed at Ariel House for one night. Beautiful Victorian home in a quiet but convenient part of Dublin. Lovely Christmas decorations. The tea and cakes were homemade. The breakfast was also really nice. The room where we stayed was on the ground floor and very spacious and comfortable. The concierge was super helpful and made us a dinner reservation at a wonderful restaurant a few minutes up the road called the Chop House. Would definitely stay here again. ,5,2017,12,03
233,Fantastic Two Night Stay,"Having tried unsuccessfully in the past to book this accommodation for a rugby weekend, its reputation as a fantastic place to stay in Dublin really lived up to expectations. We were given the WB Yeats suite which looked onto Lansdowne Road and was huge and extremely comfortable.  The breakfast, including gluten free options for my wife, was delicious.  50m to the DART to take you into the City Centre and right beside the Aviva Stadium.  Staff were wonderful.  We will be back.",5,2017,11,30
233,Looking forward to staying again,"We had a great stay in Ariel House, could not fault anything, lovely Georgian house, we had a great room, lovely staff, awarding winning breakfast, very very tasty. Great location in Dublin but essentially for the Aviva stadium.
",5,2017,11,19
233,Consistent high standard every time.,"I am a regular guest here and could not recommend it highly enough. When they are booked out and I have to go elsewhere I know others hotels will not be able to match the high standard of rooms, breakfast and friendly staff. Keep it up folks.",5,2017,11,15
233,"Comfortable, charming, great breakfast","Stayed for two nights during a business trip, very pleasant hotel with a wonderful lounge with complimentary cakes, teas and newspapers for the guest. Free Wifi, free parking. The hotel also serves a fantastic breakfast in a wonderfully bright conservatory-style breakfast room. All in all a great experience!",5,2017,11,12
233,Home from home,"This is not fancy, not modern, not flashy.  It is elegantly understated, a real home from home.  Comfortable, traditional surroundings, great staff, could not be friendlier or more helpful.  Pretty central, walk-in distance of plenty of restaurants and bars, close to transport links.  It’s a bit like going to stay at your aunts or your grans house when you were a child. Warm, friendly, homely.  If you want a change from all of the bland, vanilla hotel chains where every room looks the same and every breakfast tastes the same...   give this a try.   Great for business or family, will be back.",4,2017,11,08
233,Great place to stay!,"We stayed at Ariel House for sadly just one night.  What a warm and welcoming place!  The breakfast, as many others have said, was really a highlight; so fresh and tasty with a large selection.  I especially enjoyed the scones and brown bread.  Our room was very comfortable.  The location is a bit out of the center of the action but honestly that is a real bonus given the party action downtown!  The neighborhood was lovely and it was easy to get to all of the sights, even on foot (not a huge hike and lots to see along the way).  The staff really made our visit one to remember; before, during and even after our stay.  A special thank you to Cecilia who was extremely helpful!",5,2017,11,05
233,Receptionist excellent customer skills ,"My partner and I have stayed in Ariel house on numerous occasions. Recently when we stayed there we were disappointed with the size of the room. When i spoke to the receptionist about my concern ( I think his name is Balli) he went above and beyond his duties to assist us. He upgraded our room without any hesitation, he was an absolute gent, 10/10 in terms of his customer skills. ",5,2017,10,31
233,Wonderful Hospitality,"We spent our last 2 nights of our week-long Ireland sojourn at the Ariel House and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Our room was lovely, the staff were remarkably warm, gracious and welcoming--which made the experience so pleasant--and the food was wonderful.  I highly recommend this place.  The only thing I would mention is that I didn't appreciate quite how far this hotel is from central Dublin.  Because we were there with my parents, who are each nearing 80, the distance was slightly challenging for them.  Had it just been my husband and myself it would have been fine--we enjoyed the stroll into central Dublin, and also taking the nearby public transit, which is quite convenient.  I just mention it in case others are in a similar situation.",5,2017,10,30
233,Loved Ariel House,"My husband and I loved staying at Ariel House.  We stayed during our first 2 nights in Ireland and then again our last night.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was very nice and comfortable, close to the amazing neighborhood restaurants, our favorite ""Old Spot"" recommended by Ariel :)  Close to the train to get downtown which was so convenient!

Can't say enough about breakfast, very delicious and a great assortment, the staff during breakfast were also great and friendly!

I want to thank Ariel for upgrading our room during our last night, it wasn't expected and a wonderful surprise, felt like a King and Queen during our last night!!  Thank you and hope to be back soon!",5,2017,10,29
233,"Fantastic stay, exceptional staff!","I cannot recommend this hotel enough, mainly due to how exceptionally helpful the staff are. 

Location - although outside of the city centre, the hotel is a 30 second walk from the nearest DART (overland metro) station, and from there it's a 5 minute trip into the heart of Dublin. This means you avoid the crowds and chaos of the city centre, but aren't cut off.

Rooms - we had some problems on our first night, a very loud water pipe at 5.45am, which woke us both up. However a quick call to reception and the staff went out of their way to find a solution. This meant moving rooms which was all handled by the staff, and we were moved into a beautiful room with a huge four-poster bed. We ended up trying three different rooms, and each one had its own character and charm. The beds were always comfortable and the rooms light and airy. 

Hotel - the Georgian house is very elegant, with a big drawing room where you can have tea, cakes and coffee (all free and amazing quality). The furniture in the rooms is mostly victorian and very tastefully decorated. 

Breakfast - perfect breakfast, ideal portions, not greasy at all, great local ingredients and lots on the menu to choose from. There is also an excellent continental selection if you are up early with a huge range of cereals, fruits and homemade breads and pastries. For the Dublin marathon the staff put on an early breakfast for all the runners with some great porridge - so thoughtful! 

Staff - at every stage the staff went out of their way to be helpful, the blonde manageress was particularly warm and welcoming, and sorted out all the issues and accommodated all of our annoying requests (late check out etc).

Overall a brilliant stay, cannot recommend highly enough! THANK YOU!",5,2017,10,29
233,Nice location and excellent staff,We stayed at Ariel House on our first 2 nights in Ireland. Arrived Saturday morning and they stored our luggage for us while we started our touring. My brothers luggage did not arrive and the lady at the desk told us a good place to go to get clothes for a reasonable price until luggage came (it was a great tip - he got everything he needed for a very good price). Breakfast in the morning was good and service was excellent. Every person we dealt with at the front desk was wonderful. We would definitely stay here again. Room was decent size and beds were comfortable.,5,2017,10,27
233,Quaint and comfy!,"We stayed at the Ariel house on our last night in Ireland.  We are so glad we picked this place.  It is a very quaint and nice place with friendly staff.  The beds were comfy and they even have tea and cookies in the downstairs common area.  There are several pubs within walking distance, only 5 minutes or so. We loved the location, price and comfort! We would definitely recommend this place and would stay again! ",5,2017,10,25
233,Home away from home,This Georgian home is so quaint and quiet considering it's in the heart of Dublin. Very welcoming with an exceptional breakfast. All homemade breads and jams. Complimentary afternoon tea in lounge/library with herbal teas and selection of homemade pastries.  Room was cosy and very comfortable with tea facilities. Helpful staff and plenty of information on local amenities and entertainment. Parking is restricted but receptionist had car keys to move cars if necessary. Beautiful house and would stay here again.,5,2017,10,23
233,Date night ,"This will be our fourth visit , every time it never disappoints, book early to make sure you get a booking. Attended Jools Holland in the arena so perfect location. Comfortable room, amazing staff, incredible breakfasts. I had the pancakes and bacon which were incredible. Made to order , coffee delicious. 10stars!👍🏻⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5,2017,10,15
233,Lovely staff great stay!,"My friend and I stayed 2 nights at the Ariel House. They welcomed us after 8pm and helped us (two very tired travelers) get our bags to our rooms. 
 The morning breakfast was great! Everything cooked to perfection. 
 We did walk to Trinity College and to some art galleries. Downtown was fun and loads to see and do. 
 I would stay at the Ariel House again for my next trip to Ireland!",5,2017,10,13
233,A wonderful way to finish our honeymoon!!,"I could go on, and on about the wonderful staff and accommodations in this charming B&B, but words would not suffice!  We were welcomed there on a Monday, and spent four wonderful nights there!  I was honored to share my poetry and stories with the staff!  The Drawing Room is welcoming and the meals were wonderful!  I wish I could embrace each of the staff with a sincere hug of thanks for the kindness they showed to two weary honeymooners  on the last leg of their journey!  The advice and recommendations were spot-on!!  I would certainly recommend this Bed & Breakfast to anyone visiting Dublin!!! ",5,2017,10,10
233,Staff made the Difference,"I arrived very late (10 pm) and was concerned about reception.  Brigid was fantastic. She escorted me to a room and pointed out all the amenities.  There was an issue with the television and she insisted I move to a new room.  All this transpired in less than 15 minutes.
The room was large, furniture was comfortable and the bathroom was more than adequate.
Breakfast was varied and delicious.
Book early, Ariel House is #1 for many good reasons;  service is five star.",4,2017,10,06
233,Sir,"Aries House was a gracious 19th Century grand house remade into a guest house with more than 30 generous rooms, and exceptional breakfast offerings ( not burnt!).
Staff were friendly, but very competent and professional.
Location was great for us - 200 metres to the station, 3 stops to central Dublin. Many eating or drinking options less than 10 mins walk from the guest house.
Not cheap, but no compromise on quality and care.",5,2017,10,06
233,Victorian stay in Dublin,It is a hotel in a Victorian brownstone.  The building lived up to our expectations.  Parking is difficult at best and insufficient for the size of the hotel.  If you need to leave early it is necessary to park on the street as you may be blocked in otherwise.  Regardless of what other reviews say we found the the staff a bit indifferent to us.  The hotel suggestion about walking to downtown is a joke.,3,2017,09,29
233,This remains one of our favorite B&Bs,"This is our second time staying at this wonderful place . . . and we loved it even more this time.  The staff is amazing and so helpful.  A special shout out to Jenny who was able to secure a real treasure for us from Dublin - she is the greatest!!!  In addition, our room was clean and large.  Our breakfast was also amazing - the cold buffet was terrific and the hot choices were a great compliment to the cold selections offered.  The B&B is located on a beautiful quiet street just outside of the city but it is an easy walk to the center of town.  The drawing room is also a really nice place to hang out and have coffee and scones . . .this is our go-to B&B when visiting Dublin and I cannot wait until we are able to come back!",5,2017,09,28
233,The staff makes the stay amazing,"This is a beautiful old building that is listed under hotels, but to us seemed like a hybrid of hotel and bed n breakfast.  The welcome and attention you receive from the staff is the best you will encounter in Ireland. We were completely jetlagged upon arrival. Jenny McEwen greeted us and immediately made us feel at home.   She made sure we were properly situated and then took about 15 minutes just making sure we had the information we requested complete with a walking map and recommendations for local eating establishments. 
The rooms are decorated with antique furniture as is the reception area with the piano, flowers, large bay window, and couches near a fireplace.  Simply charming.  Breakfast was included with our stay and the food was substantial.  You will be full.
Having travelled throughout Ireland, all of the beds there are firmer than one would find in the U.S. and Ariel House is no exception.  
There is one main entryway to the hotel (pictured in Trip advisor photo) and it does include stairs.  We stayed on the ground level, and the staff simply opened a back door to let us in with luggage so we didn't have to do 2 sets of stairs. However, once you are in your room, you need to enter via staircase and then go to your room.  These folks are so nice though, if you sincerely had an issue, I am certain they would make whatever accommodation was necessary for you.   
We did not heed the advice of ""don't rent a vehicle while in Dublin"", and it literally stayed parked from the time we unloaded luggage at the hotel, until we left Dublin.  Wasted money, sadly.  Parking is difficult in Ireland, in especially in Dublin.  Even if you do find a spot, they are far more narrow than those to which we are accustomed. Take taxis, walk, Uber, or whatever.  A vehicle in Dublin will just not be very helpful.  A fellow American was wary about trying to park at the Ariel House and the staff member just parked it for them.  That's how incredibly helpful they are.  
Helpful hints:  1.  Know the standard of room they use in Ireland prior to making reservations.  I was used to King, queen, twin and they use similar terms but they mean different things. Any questions, just email or ask staff in advance.  They are very helpful.
2.   If you are very sensitive to noise, bring earplugs.  Its not a noisy place by any means, but if you are already struggling with time zone changes, all noise will be amplified to you.  That's natural.  I used foam earplugs and I heard nothing. 
3.  Take the advice about where to eat and what to do.
4.   Make reservations well in advance of your trip to get the best possible rooms at the best rates.",4,2017,09,23
233,Loved the Ariel House,"We only stayed at the Ariel House. However, from the moment we arrived we knew it was a special place. The house is lovely and they welcome you with tea and cakes (we were early and our room was not ready). We had a room downstairs (which one reviewer described as a dark basement), which was actually at street level. We had a nice view out our window of their side garden. The room was tiny but well appointed with lovely Donegal tweed blankets on each bed. The room was quiet and clean. The staff was great about helping us with our bags. The location is about a half of a block from a train station. It was very easy to get down to the Trinity College area to walk around (2 stops). The recommended restaurant near Ariel House is called ""The Spot"" or something like that and we enjoyed it.",5,2017,09,20
233,A perfect little hotel with OUTSTANDING SERVICE?,"
If your idea of the perfect hotel is a small, attractive, well maintained, independent hotel where you are treated like family from the moment you arrive with excellent service, a delicious breakfast included in the rate, free WiFi and parking then The Ariel House is your hotel.

There are three things I look for when choosing a hotel; location, quality and value.  Regarding location, The Ariel House is not in the noisy central part of Dublin but instead in Ballsbridge, an upmarket and quiet neighborhood which is only a fifteen minute walk from the action.  It is only a five minute walk away from some outstanding restaurants and a supermarket.

Regarding quality; The Ariel House is very attractive, extremely well maintained with a wonderful staff who are always friendly and helpful.  The pallor on the first floor is a stunning room is always open with tea, coffee and pastry almost always available.  Although the breakfast menu is somewhat limited their cooked to order items are delicious.

Regarding value, after endless researching to find the perfect high quality hotel in a good location with a rate that included full breakfast, free WiFi and parking The Ariel House was by far the WINNER!

FYI, I was traveling with my husband along with his brother, sister and their spouses for this two week trip to Ireland.  I did all the research and planning regarding accommodations which included choosing a hotel for each of our six destinations.  I have planned many trips with groups of friends/family so I understood that choosing anything other than a perfect hotel in each location would likely equate to my traveling companion's complaining at breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I had the luck of the Irish on this trip as The entire group loved all of our hotels.

",5,2017,09,19
233,Warm and welcoming,My husband and I stayed for 5 nights at the end of October 2016 and would stay there again for sure!  The accommodation was basic but very clean and we really enjoyed the welcoming and helpful staff.  The breakfast buffet was wonderful and so was the complementary afternoon and evening tea/coffee with treats!  Location was pretty good with transit options near by.  A number of restaurants are in the area but reservations are required or you are out of luck.,4,2017,09,17
233,Beyond Accommodating Service,"The glowing reviews convinced me to book at the Ariel House when planning a trip to Ireland, and they lived up to their great reputation with our own stay. The warm reception and exceptional care we received were well beyond customary service levels.
We arrived quite early to the hotel, seeking a simple respite from our morning plane arrival, on which neither of us could sleep. We merely were seeking a place to unload our luggage, but were instead allowed a 3 hour early check-in and a complimentary upgrade to a spacious, Victorian inspired junior suite, with a lovely view of the back garden/green space. This simple act allowed for a much needed recharging from our travel weariness, and set us off wonderfully on our visit to Ireland.
The breakfast was one of the best we had in our two week stay around the country, and the setting for it was picturesque and cosy. I found the price reasonable and comparable to our other stays, with some allowances given to the quality of everything they offered. I could not be more grateful to the staff's willing accommodations, and will definitely be making plans for future holiday stays in Dublin.",5,2017,09,16
233,Lovely place,"I loved our stay at the Ariel House. Though it was 1 mile from the center of town, it was only a 30 minute walk or quick train ride away. We got so lucky to have been upgraded to a large suite when we checked in and it was awesome! The rooms were Victorian and feminine and chic. The staff and reception were excellent. Bri was so helpful. On our first morning, we were running late for our tour of the Book of Kells and the staff were able to get us a breakfast to go in a short times notice. The breakfast was fantastic, and I'm glad they were able to squeeze us in just after the finished serving. I got the traditional Irish breakfast which was such a healthy portion. Their buffet was also amazing.  This was our first stop on our tour of Ireland, and it was a great start. I would highly recommend it if you're looking for something that has a more historic, Victorian feel to it, the service of a very nice/ luxury inn, and the friendliness of a B&B. Thanks again!",5,2017,09,15
233,"Great stay, but very expensive breakfast","This is a very nice place to stay: the location is in a nice residential area where apparently CEOs of various tax avoiding firms live, so it is nice, leafy and pleasant.
It is in a walkable distance to the centre and very close to the Hop On Bus Stop (we highly recommend yellow Cityscape buses - only 12 euros if bought online!).

It is very evident that the effort was put into decor and various special touches which do set this hotel apart, like a nice 'drawing room' where the guests can sit and enjoy a complimentary tea of all sorts with fabulous cake; the furniture is also kept in style of that Victorian (I guess) house. Whilst the place is full of character there is a price to pay: our room was relatively noisy when people moved around - it didn't bother us too much because 'movement' didn't happen too often :-)

I was torn between 4 and 5 stars rating, because we felt there was one thing that might put us off from staying in the future: the extortionate price of the breakfast (30 euros for two!), and the glorious reviews of this allegedly gorgeous experience only make us more envious that we could not afford to try it! We did even try (unsuccessfully) to 'negotiate' the price with reception! 

Other than that,  a perfect place to stay in Dublin.",4,2017,09,14
233,Fabulous room and a great breakfast,"Ariel House was the perfect spot for our 2-night stay in Dublin.  Our large room had a slightly separate sitting area that was perfect for relaxing before heading out to dinner.  Many restaurants within a short walking distance, and city center was an easy 20 minute walk, which was perfect considering the great weather we had.  Alternatively, a DART station is 100 yards away.  The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was a real treat with several hot menu selections in addition to the continental buffet.  You won't be disappointed staying at Ariel House!",5,2017,09,11
233,Dublin weekend,This is a great hotel in a fabulous location. Very easy access to Dublin City Centre. Room fantastic and bedrooms very comfortable. Nearby you have The Old Spot which serves fantastic food. Tea and cakes in the afternoon sublime. This establishment knows how to achieve customer excellence.,5,2017,09,09
233,Great place to stay,We had a great reception given we were 2 hrs early. Got coffee and biscuits. It's very cosy and comfortable. It's near the train station and 20min walk to the center of Dublin. The wifi works very well in the rooms as well!,5,2017,09,07
233,Great location ,"Four of us stayed here, what a great location if you like rugby you are located on Lansdowne rd.
20 minutes walk to the centre of Dublin. 5 minutes by train which is 2 minutes away.
Lovely clean room and really good breakfast. ",5,2017,09,06
233,Great,"A delightful lounge area with comfy sofas, Tea, coffee & newspapers available all day. And little home made cakes. A really nice place to relax after sightseeing all day. The Staff at the B&B were excellent, from the greeting on arrival to service at breakfast time. I would recommend it without reservation. It is also within five minutes of the railway station, which gets you into Dublin in about 10 minutes so. 
Thank you everyone, you made out stay a pleasure.",5,2017,09,06
233,"Great service, awesome breakfast, good location. ","We enjoyed our first 2 nights in Ireland at Ariel House. Service was exemplary and breakfast was superb - one of the best. They were very helpful and accommodating since our plane landed early in the morning - offering breakfast, keeping our luggage for the day and allowing an early check in.  Location was just what we were looking for -  outside City Centre but easy enough to get down to the main tourist sites either walking or by the DART. Hotel helped with providing the bus name for transport from the airport to hotel which cost just over 8 Euro (one way). Room was large, clean and well maintained. And again, buffet and cooked breakfast included - good value overall. ",5,2017,09,02
233,Nice boutique Hotel,"Ariel house is small clean and comfortable hotel, a litle bit far from the center of the city, we stayed for one night between flight and getting out of Dublin. the hotel staff had a  warm welcome smile and  breakfast was kind and tasty.",4,2017,09,02
233,Great B&B with Awesome Breakfast,"Very comfortable B&B with a magnificent breakfast.  B&B is at one end of the city which is a drawback if you are driving.  The streets are not well marked and it was frustrating for us to find the place.  We finally asked a taxi driver for directions and he let us follow him to the B&B.  The place is very clean, the staff is very accommodating, the beds are very comfortable and the breakfast is awesome.",5,2017,08,31
233,Pleasant hotel with friendly staff,"This is a classic town house hotel, well located for the Aviva stadium. Our room was at the rear, but too warm. If the window was opened the noise from the DART train passing every 15 minutes is loud and annoying from 7.00am until 11.15pm. This was compounded on one of our nights by the incessant barking of a dog located outside a neighbouring property until well past midnight! The beds were comfortable, but the old wardrobe was far too small. Breakfast was lovely in a bright dining room and the staff were extremely pleasant although our booking, made 4 months in advance, at first could not be found on their system - causing unnecessary anxiety upon arrival.",3,2017,08,31
233,Lovely time,"Just finished a four night stay at the Ariel House.   

It is a lovely house, beautiful, quiet street a quick walk to the train station.  The staff is very nice and very helpful.  They helped us with everything from a bucket of ice, to restaurant recommendations (all good), to late night pizza.  

A bit far away from town, walking back and forth got old but we got our steps in!  Had we mastered the train/bus/tram/rail system we probably could have saved our aching feet. However, that was not the case during our short stay.  The walk from the airport bus to Ariel house is quite easy I will say that.

There is no air conditioning.  I get it - we're in Ireland.  However, there was no air moving in our room and we were given a comforter with a Duvet cover.  Man on man it was hot the first night.  This was quickly remedied as we asked for a fan and sheets.  Much better. The bed is small.  My husband is over six feet tall and he was pretty scrunched in the four poster bed we had. I agree with the assessment on the sheets, they are rough.  Seems petty, but when most places are peddling their ""hotel linens"" you get spoiled.  Pillows need upgrading as well.  The furniture and carpeting is a bit, well, worn (it's an old house, again, I get it).  Charming on some levels, tired looking on others. The dresser in our room had various stages of pulls gone from the drawers, there were stains on our carpet.  The hair dryer in the bathroom didn't work but there was another one to use. 

Everyone has commented on the breakfast and how good it is.  I'm not sure my husband and I would rave about it.  It was good and ample.  We probably didn't give it a fair shake as we slept through it half the time.

We were very kindly given our room early upon arrival.  Unfortunately no one gave the lawn guy the memo that we were exhausted because he fired up the hedge trimmer around noon and worked for over two hours.  Oh well.  

Seemed to me the pastries in the foyer were hit or miss.  Sometimes they were there, other times not.  I loved all the lovely fresh flowers all around.

Bottom line on Ariel House.  It is a very nice bed and breakfast experience.  I debated long and hard between staying in the Hilton or B&B.  I went B&B and I don't regret it.  However, next time I would probably go Hilton merely for the location and a more comfortable bed.  

Thank you to everyone who made this an enjoyable stay.  Feel free to PM me if you have any questions.",4,2017,08,28
233,beautiful property 5 min from city,"bed and breakfast,
welcoming and excellent help.
room moderate size , clean , strong shower.  comfortable bed.   ambience excellent as was the delicious breakfast.   tea room for afternoon tea was great for just relaxing , chatting , for a snack and a tea.   the DART train is a 1 min walk from the front door.   and takes 5 min to get into the heart of dublin.  however if you choose to walk it will take about a 1/2 hour.  which is also fine.",5,2017,08,27
233,Personal Touches Make for a Memorable Stay,We chose Ariel House as the base for our Irish wedding. No request was too small for the wonderful team that run this hotel. The hotel is gorgeous and the bedroom was totally grand. But the breakfasts were to die for with amazing staff and service looking after us. Big thank you to Cecilia for making our wedding stay and preparations so memorable and special for us and all our guests. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. ,5,2017,08,25
233,Beautiful boutique hotel in an excellent Dublin location! An oasis in the city!,"We LOVED the Ariel House hotel! All of the staff were helpful, and Brid and Cecilia really went the extra meter to help us navigate our visit to Dublin. Location is great, in a safe neighborhood, a short walk to the train station. The dining room was completely unexpected, so beautiful, and food was terrific.  I LOVED the pottery serving pieces on the buffet. We would definitely stay here again, and definitely recommend this hotel to others.",5,2017,08,16
233,"handsome hotel, but poor room","Twice I had been to Dublin, twice I had stayed at Ariel House, twice I had written a positive critique at Tripadvisor. But this -third- time I was let down by the room. Obviously partitioned from a larger space, with a dry wall that has no ambitions in sound acoustics, so you could hear every corridor and reception activity. The room itself was furnished with ill maching antiquated pieces, the bathroom was far from practical with outdated plumping, there was no safe, nor fridge, and in case you wanted to open the window, all kitchen ventilation exhaust would flood in. 
A pitty, as the strong points of this fine hotel are still there: The handsome building, the convenient -if off-centre- location, the extra friendly and polite staff, the fabulous breakfast, the relaxing drawing room with tea and biscuits. Would I be back? Certainly yes, but checking carefully the specs of the room I am about to book.....",4,2017,08,16
233,Nice older Georgian structure very close to a train station,"The Ariel house was our first stay in Ireland.  It is an older, Georgian style building.  The staff was outstanding and made us feel right at home.

One of our favorite places was the sitting room.  It is an old parlor that has tea and coffee available anytime you wish, with magazines and newspapers, comfortable chairs to sit in with music always playing in the background.

The breakfast buffet was very extensive, with a made to order breakfast that is excellent as well.  The breakfast area is bright and sunny, and tables are private as opposed to other B&B's we stayed in that were family style.

The property is only a very short walk to the DART train on Landsdowne street.  This is two stops from the Trinity College stop in downtown Dublin.  The only negative I could imagine is it's proximity to the Aviva stadium, which is only a block or so away.  If you stayed when an event was going on, I could see driving there to be very difficult.

All in all, this was a good choice for us.  It is in a quiet neighborhood (as long as there are no events at the stadium) with easy access to downtown.  We used our credit card to pay with points, which was a bonus as well!",4,2017,08,12
233,Nicest place I've stayed in Dublin yet!,"After being told about this place through a friend I booked 2 garden rooms & from the moment we arrived I was not disappointed. The staff are excellent, even with a mix up on bookings the receptionist was very helpful & polite. 
On arrival we were too early to check in but were offered lovely coffee & buns & had the use of a room to freshen up. 
Our rooms were spotlessly clean & well equipped & like the whole place full of character & a special atmosphere in it.
Breakfast had an amazing spread & such a nice bright room too. 
There are some lovely restaurants around & the RDS was less than 10 minute walk.
I have rebooked for next year & would highly recommend. Thank you Ariel house you made our Dublin Horse Show even better!",5,2017,08,12
233,Deserves its very good reputation,"Stayed two nights at Ariel House, an up-market B&B comprising two (or possibly three!) adjoining Victorian houses in the south-Dublin Ballsbridge area. It's a few minutes walk to Lansdowne Road Dart station for the short train journey into Dublin centre and just a little longer to walk to a number of great restaurants and bars. The hotel/B&B has a substantial stone staircase leading from the private parking area to the front door and, to the best of my knowledge, has no internal lift so could pose a problem to those with restricted mobility. Once inside it is warm and welcoming. Complimentary tea, coffee, cake and biscuits were provided mid afternoon and the breakfast was substantial and had more choice of hot dishes than I would have suspected - all were excellent. The room was comfortable; en suite facilities very acceptable. The hotel might put itself through a modern decoration program at some stage but the current decor is perfectly acceptable and in tune with its age. It's not cheap (we paid 180 euro per couple per night) but Dublin itself is not an inexpensive city for hotel accommodation. Would we stay again - most certainly. Note: Ariel House is very close to the Aviva Stadium so if there is international rugby or another activity there at the time of a proposed visit, prepare for  it to be busy.",4,2017,08,10
233,Outstanding Experience with Ariel House!,"My husband and I stayed at Ariel House for three nights in July - 19, 20 and 21. To say that our stay was absolutely wonderful is an understatement! The location is quiet, convenient and charming. The hotel is beautiful and comfortable. The breakfast is fantastic. The customer service/hospitality is outstanding and beyond anything we have ever experienced. Upon our arrival, I was quite ill and realized that I required medical attention. Cecelia immediately called 3 different medical providers and arranged an appointment and transportation to the facility. On that first evening we had an unfortunate accident involving the toilet in our room (our fault). The ever kind and cheerful Cecelia evaluated the situation and arranged an alternate room for the night. The toilet was repaired (actually replaced) the next morning at 10AM and the owner, Jennie, absolutely refused to allow us to pay for it! Jennie and her staff assisted us with bus routes, sightseeing tickets and more. The 24-hour staff is readily available to assist with any questions and requests. When we return to Dublin we would not even consider staying anywhere else. Ariel House does have ample parking and is a leisurely four-minute walk from the nearest bus stop. Congratulations to Ariel House as you are finest accommodations in Dublin! Sincerely, Your (high-maintenance) American friends, Karen and Gary Gray",5,2017,08,05
233,Good and Bad,"The Ariel House is in a nice neighborhood of Ballsbridge and has enormous potential, but it seems to have experienced some deferred maintenance.  While the staff and food served at breakfast were both wonderful, the facility is showing signs of aging a bit less than gracefully.  The carpet in our room was a bit tired, the room itself ready for painting and the bedding a bit too firm.  The sheets were of a rough thread count making the sleep experience less than optimum.  Our shower was on the blink, so the on duty manager found us another room where we could bathe.  This property has so much potential my hope is their issues can be resolved.",3,2017,08,05
233,Dozing in Dublin,"After reading other reviews we decided that Ariel House would be a good place for our 2 night stay upon arrival in Ireland.  It was a bit longer walk into Dublin town center than expected (about 20 minutes and we are not slow walkers), however, we enjoyed the stroll on several occasions (light outside until 10 PM in June!) and the quiet stay away from the noise and activity of downtown.  Our room and bathroom were comfortable and clean despite the older bedroom carpet and decor.
      A highlight was the delightful and delicious breakfast in the sunny breakfast room - traditional Eggs Benedict for me and with smoked salmon for my daughter plus a buffet of breads, muffins, fruit, juice, cereals, coffee and tea. We also enjoyed relaxing in the front parlor that was stocked with single serve coffee & tea with china cups & saucers and mini cake bites.
     There was ample free parking which was important to us as we had picked up our rental car upon arrival at Dublin's airport.  (We did not use the car while in Dublin but did not want to spend time obtaining it before starting our Ireland road trip on day 3.) 
There is a steep staircase to reach the front door so do pack light!",4,2017,08,04
233,Pretty Good but not Excellent ,"Decent place and lovely staff but probably not worth the money- especially without breakfast included. Appreciated the free tea and cake and free parking but other than that didn't think it was worth the money, fairly average rooms and facilities to be honest- a bit surprised by how good the other reviews are! ",3,2017,08,03
233,Extraordinary service in a lovely setting,"My husband and I stayed at Ariel House twice in July, and were very pleased. The beautifully converted Victorian building is conveniently located near restaurants, laundry, and DART station. The bedroom was small but well furnished, and we had access to a comfortable ""drawing room"" for reading and afternoon tea. An ample and varied breakfast with table service was provided in an attractive setting. What made this hotel truly outstanding, though, was the extraordinary 24-hour concierge service. Anything we needed - from advice to ice for a sprained ankle - was immediately provided with courtesy but no fuss. I have traveled extensively for five decades. Ariel House tops every other hotel staff experience.",5,2017,07,28
233,Could not be in better hands!,"This is not just a beautiful hotel.  This is not just a hotel with charm and tradition.  This is not just a hotel with a great breakfast.  This is a hotel that will take care of you for the moment you arrive until you depart.  Thank you Brid, Cecilia, and Goran (I'm sure that's not spelled right!).  Thank you for going over and above the general warm welcome.  Thank you for helping our large group out when the coach forgot to pick us up for the airport and thank you for helping me with my daughter and her hospital stay.  You gave us peace of mind and comfort.  Love this place and those who work here!!  I feel like you are friends!",5,2017,07,26
233,The two worst choices online so far: Expedia and Ariel House (Dublin),"Expedia online reservation: superior twin room at Ariel House for $ 167.
Room received at Ariel House in Dublin: standard (and very poor) twin room. After 10 minutes of talks, I got a standard room slightly larger than the first one, but not what I had booked. The man at the reception was awkward and seemed even disturbed.The rooms are with worn and dirty furniture. The curtain was caught with a string.  Only linen and bathroom were clean. The next day, I got an invoice with the price of 123 euros (a lower price than the initial one). The invoice was fake, because from the Expedia  took all 167 $ (142 euros). I say again that I will avoid Expedia and I suggest you walk around this site for several reasons: it is unfriendly, it does not work with the speed of others, it is limited and it does not give access to reviews, which even demonstrates that it is exactly afraid of these reactions .",2,2017,07,26
233,Great hotel in quiet location (when stadium isn't in use),"It's really close to the stadium and stayed there while nothing was on there, so was perfect.  The breakfasts were great quality.  I had a really early morning flight, and they gave me a takeaway breakfast.",4,2017,07,26
233,Just ok,"I reread the reviews to see what I missed.  Our room was dark, with one window and a stained, spotted carpet, a lumpy bed, and loud, young children running up and down the hall.  Fifteen minutes from Dublin.
Plusses: 
Free parking 
The parlor room was cozy and charming (though the chairs were worn and lumpy)
The breakfast room was nice (though we had to wait to sit down)
This is a three star, so don't expect more.",3,2017,07,25
233,Amazing Accommodation,"Booked here after reading the reviews and enjoyed a fantastic four day break. Despite arriving very early we were given the warmest welcome, our bags were securely stored and we were offered breakfast which was one of the best I have eaten. The full Irish is just that and worth every euro. Service levels here are way ahead of many top brand hotels and the friendly and charming staff always go the extra mile to ensure guests feel welcome. Our large bedroom was very comfortable and clean and the black out curtains ensured great sleep. The hotel is a short walk from the light rail service (Dart) which provides a very reasonable service into the city. There are also a number of decent eateries nearby if distance becomes a problem. Overall a fabulous hotel which we look forward to returning to soon. Highly recommended. ",5,2017,07,25
233,Such a Lovely Spot,"I loved everything about this hotel! The moment we arrived we were warmly welcomed. The concierge was absolutely great. We were early for check in, so she moved some stuff around, and we were in our room within five minutes. They have tea, coffee, cookies and cakes in the drawing room, and the breakfast in the morning was delicious. The appearance of the hotel is quite grand, yet old school (in the best way). It is only about a 15 minute walk to the Oscar Wild statue and the hop on hop off bus stop. Also, it's less than a five minute walk to the dart station (train). I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin. This place spoiled us! ",5,2017,07,23
233,Best place to stay in Dublin,Fantastic location very close to Lansdowne Road DART station which gets you into the city in a few minutes. Lovely old house with good sized rooms and a nice sitting room with tea & coffee. The bed is good but the quilt was much too hot in July so had to use the throw as a blanket.  The breakfast is excellent there is an amazing menu to choose from as well as a buffet.  I will highly recommend this place to our friends. ,5,2017,07,23
233,Charming guest-house,"A lovely traditional guest house with a cosy living room serving all day infusions and cakes. Limited but very helpful staff. Ariel House is away from downtown bustle in a residential area, but only three train stations (about one mile) away from central Dublin. No dining; after a long day we had to venture out to find dinner in one of the few pubs and restaurants close by which were extremely full.",4,2017,07,20
233,One of a kind,"Even after a stay in a ""City of Words"" like Dublin, my vocabulary stretches to meet the challenge of describing our stay at Ariel House.  We stayed for a total of six days, bookending our travels to the West and Northwest for family sightseeing. The place is attractive and well-located, but the uniqueness of Ariel House lies in the staff: welcoming, knowledgeable,efficient, thoughtful, and gracious.  Here management leads by example, and the rest of staff is led to provide a five-star hotel guest experience. Recommendations, reservations and luggage handling,  
 were all handled with charm and efficiency.  The provided breakfast is excellent, with attentive service in a very pleasant setting.It is a quick ride on DART transit to the stops in the center of the city, and there are some good eating places in easy walking distance.  Our room was clean and well-appointed. We utilized the Drawing Room, and enjoyed the chance to meet other guests.  Our one suggestion for improvement would be to strengthen the Wi-Fi so that it reaches the further rooms.  We have been many places, but Ariel House is one of a kind.",5,2017,07,20
233,Old style hotel,We stayed one night at the Ariel House which is located in a quiet area near the Aviva Stadium. The place is very quaint and has a nice vintage vibe and style. My only issue with Ariel is the creaky floorboards which may disturb guests. We had someone upstairs that moved around at night disturbing our sleep. Breakfast was great with a small buffet and cooked breakfast. Parking is available as well.,4,2017,07,19
233,Very nice boutique hotel with good staff,"Very nice rooms and great breakfast.  Only issue is way too many stairs.  The staff did help bring them back up to the lobby and then down again to the street, but there were a lot of stairs.  They were very helpful with directions and suggestions.  Not a lot of restaurants nearby (only 1 we found and it was in another hotel).  Near AMerican Embassy and buses.",5,2017,07,16
233,Excellent Hotel in a beautiful location,"The is a little gem of a hotel, in a lovely part of the city with easy access to the centre of Town. If you time from DART Train well, you be in the heart of Temple Bar within 15 minutes. Very easy to get to from the Airport, I got the Aircoach and got off at the Ballsbridge Hotel stop, but you have to use 487 Bus stop close to the US Embassy for your Air coach journey back to the airport. Just remember to get your Leapfrog Visitor's pass at the airport, they do 1 day, 3 days and 7 days pass to use on all the public transport in Dublin.

Great bars and restaurants close by, Searson's is a great bar with a good atmosphere and they do great food as well. If you fancy a curry, you should try Ravi's kitchen, really friendly staff and fantastic food. Also for bits a piece you need for your days out, there is a Tesco Metro next to Searson's.

The Hotel is 2 Victorian houses joined together, looks fantastic from the outside and they tried to keep as much of the old Victorian deco on the inside. The rooms are a very good sizes, as it is an old Victorian building, there is no Air Con. I am sure if you asked the might be able to supply with an fan for the room. I am only guessing they could supply a fan, as the staff were very friendly and super helpful. I found there was only 1 spare socket, I do have to remind everyone, this is an old Victorian house. So maybe bring a small extension cable with you, if you have many electric items need charging? So if there was more sockets and a fan in the room, I would of given 5 out of 5?

I highly recommend and would come again, it was that great stay at the Ariel House Hotel. :-D",4,2017,07,11
233,"Large room, Great breakfast, Dirty Shower","We booked a double-room, which was large. The breakfast pancakes were excellent.
The staff is nice. The House is situated a 30 minute walk from the city-center. The shower-head was really disgusting, else-wise everything looked clean.",4,2017,07,11
233,Charming B&B; Fascinating City,"My wife and I greatly enjoyed our stay at the Ariel House.  It's away from Dublin city center, requiring a car or tram or a long walk; but worth it in many ways.  The rooms are comfortable; modern bathrooms; nice sitting room with pastry and tea or coffee available in the afternoons.  Very enjoyable.  The staff were particularly helpful to sort out the details of our trip.  And the free breakfast was the best ever.  I recommend the poached eggs and smoked salmon.  I might need to go back.",5,2017,07,10
233,Room had few problems,"First all the positives. Great location close to the DART and a short walk to good restaurants and pubs. The building is very nice with a lovely lounge and breakfast room. The breakfast is very good freshly cooked to order. Now the issues we found on our 3 night stay. The room at first glance appears lovely but it had a very small brass double bed. We are used to at least queen size or bigger in our travels and found this plain uncomfortable. The chairs in the room appeared to have no springs and were very uncomfortable. Another guest said that he went to the lounge as his chairs were so uncomfortable. The tv in the room must have been 10+ years old, obviously wasn't HD and had a very poor picture quality. Strange given the name of the property. There was nowhere in the bathroom to put anything with the exception of a small shelf right over the toilet. Call me fussy but my toothbrush wasn't going to reside there. There was plenty of room to remedy this problem. This is an expensive property and unfortunately lets itself down with these problems.",4,2017,07,10
233,Excellent,"Our 3 night stay was excellent. The staff was gracious and the breakfast was excellent. Our room was quite large. Unfortunately, we aren't able to experience the afternoon tea. 

If the location suits you, I'd highly recommended the Ariel house. ",5,2017,07,10
233,Wonderful Family Irish Vacation,"Overall, Ariel House was a wonderfully welcoming atmosphere for our first nights in Ireland- nice, clean, cheerful and hospitable. A great start to our Irish family vacation. The beds were comfortable and the shower nice, though a bit small. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. The food was delicious, and the breakfasts were great. In particular, the brown Irish soda bread was freshly baked every morning and brought to the table warm and delicious. The breakfast buffet had a wonderful selection of foods, including wonderful scones and pastries; the dining room had an exceptional atmosphere and excellent service. Both the tea and coffee were excellent. The first night my daughter had smoked salmon that tasted fresh and was beautifully smoked.

We particularly enjoyed the tea and cakes in the drawing room on the afternoon of the second day.  We got caught in a downpour, not atypical for Ireland.  When we arrived at Ariel House, they had no tea but within a few minutes of our arrival in the drawing room, the staff had made a fresh warm pot of tea.  

The location was conveniently near a DART station- the intercity train with Dublin.   It was also a reasonable walk to the city center, about 20 – 30 min.   Within a 5-minute walk, there was a restaurant park that was recommended to us by the staff at Ariel House and had multiple restaurants with delicious food.

During our stay, we had an issue with the TV remote, as it needed new batteries.  When we went to the front desk to get new batteries, within 10 minutes everything was fixed.",5,2017,07,08
233,Looked After So Beautifully,"On the advice of friends who had a wonderful time at Ariel House, my husband and I decided to book there for our honeymoon - 3 nites - 2 on our way in to Ireland and 1 on our way out. At the time, Ariel House was booked for the dates we wanted. And unbelievably, when they had a cancellation - right when we had wanted to be there - Bríd, the Deputy General Manager of Ariel House, took the time to find our initial inquiry and offered us our room! Yes, Ariel House is that kind!!! When we arrived, bleary-eyed from our overnight flight from Canada, Cecilia at the front desk greeted us with great genuine warmth :)  She thought of everything we might need: she gave us a lovely breakfast. She had our beautiful room made up asap so we were able to get into it and nap after breakfast - much faster than a regular hotel would have been able to accommodate us! Our room was clean, well appointed and lovely. Loved the towel warmer. We had nice view onto the street and it was quiet. (There were no games at the Avia stadium while we were there). Ariel House is also literally just a 2 minute walk up the street to the Lansdowne Rd. DART station - and it takes 5 minutes to get into the city or just 20 minutes to walk. And it's a lovely walk. The front desk is so helpful in showing you how to get to places and giving good recommendations on where to eat in the city and close by. We were spoiled rotten. We loved it. We will return for sure!! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!

233,Breakfast trumps Basement,"The Ariel House B & B is in a great location, just a few minutes walk to the DART rail station. The entrance is a flight of stairs up, so if travelers have a lot of bags they might need help getting them up to check-in.  The reception area and staff are nice.  We booked a garden standard room.  If you don't like warm rooms in the summer, don't get a basement/garden standard room in the ""modern"" (circa late 80's?) annex  - it's too hot in the summer,  there might not be good air circulation from the outside unless a fan is provided.  We had a fan,and even then, our room still felt stuffy.  Curtains are best left open at night for fresh air from an open window that is level to the garden,  but then the early sunrise could be a problem for light sleepers.  Our garden ""view"" was really just a narrow strip of grass and random shrubs.  I should also mention that there are some stairs to navigate to the basement which with luggage, could be an issue for some guests.

""Antique"" Furniture in our room appeared worn and a little roughed up and took up a lot of room where luggage needed storing.  There's not enough shelf space in the bathroom for guest toiletries, and the sink could use a hand towel rack next to it for convenience. Washcloths were an added bonus, though. The bathroom door was missing a hook (the base was still there) for hanging towels etc.  

The room's flat screen TV was not much bigger than a standard computer monitor.  A pen and paper pad were lacking in the room and would have been handy for notes.  The Wifi worked great throughout the Inn.

Breakfast was amazing  with lots of selections (oh, the toasted brown bread!) and the staff was very friendly.  Formal Afternoon Tea is only on the weekend but there were small snacks and beverages in the parlor room throughout the afternoon. 

Like the air temperature in the basement room, my spouse and I were lukewarm about this property, especially given that it's described as luxurious.. We'd probably give it another chance, especially because of the location and glorious breakfast,  but for warmer months, we would definitely choose a room in the main part of the B & B.",3,2017,07,06
233,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed here for one night on a bed & breakfast basis in Ariel House, the room, breakfast and service were all excellent.
I was especially impressed with the room it was really spacious with a lovely big window and four poster bed!
I only wish we could have had spent more time in it but we will definitely return soon for a more leisurely stay!
Jean!",5,2017,07,05
233,A Dream Come True!!,"Before booking with the Ariel House, I contacted and read reviews of over 30 hotels in Dublin to accommodate our group of 22 adults and 3 small children. The Ariel House exceeded every possible expectation and we could not have been happier!
Things we enjoyed:
-The house is stunning. Our group enjoyed relaxing in the parlor and the breakfast room is a beautiful room with glass windows and ceiling. Our rooms were spacious, clean, sunny. It was an ""antique atmosphere"" but with new bathrooms and linens. 
-Very friendly and helpful staff! Brid and Lucas are amazing hosts.
-Delicious and very filling breakfast! Ordering breakfast off the menu plus a large buffet table of cereals and pastries was a great way to start our day. They just kept bringing more and more delicious food!
-Location: Literally a 30 second walk from the DART. The neighborhood is so relaxing and peaceful with about 10 restaurants a 6 minute walk away. We really enjoyed staying outside the tourist part of the city but also being so close by DART. 

We would highly recommend the Ariel House to everyone going to Dublin and my husband is already dreaming of us going back without the large group and the kids. :)",5,2017,07,01
233,Most helpful staff,"I had booked to stay here on the night of Phill Collins concert - on arriving at the hotel I was delighted to find that it was within a few steps of the Aviva stadium and looked like a lovely place with the most helpful staff.  However, we then discovered that I had booked the room for the month of July and not June! and the hotel was fully booked for that night.  Totally my own fault but the guy on reception was so nice - he rang around other hotels to get us a room and held on to our bags while we went to the concert.  After the concert we picked up our bags and trotted off on our way.  I was so sorry not to have been staying there.  Next concert in the Aviva I will be booking this hotel again (for the right month) it is so convenient to the stadium",5,2017,06,28
233,Authentic with Excellent Staff,Arrived late in the night and didn't have dinner. Tariq brought us some biscuits and cake. He's such a sweetheart. Ariel house is authentically beautiful. Comfy and cost without trying to hard. Free parking and market about 500 mtrs away. ,5,2017,06,26
233,Truly an excellent place (Aivan huippupaikka),"Extremely nice and cozy place. Best service that we have ever got in any accommodation. Marvelous breakfast. Nice and quiet. Very good location next to the train station i.e. fast and easy to go down town. Good restaurants near by. I truly recommend !

Aivan huippupaikka. Maailman paras palvelu, erinomainen aamupala ja paikka kaikin puolin hieno ja todella rauhallinen. Lähijunalla pääsee hetkesä halvalla keskustaan. Hyviä ruokapaikkojakin kävelymatkan päässä. SUOSITTELEN !",5,2017,06,22
233,The room makes all the difference!,"We started out in a room that had rather shabby, stained furniture and a shower with no hot water. Room 229 could use some attention: the bed was uncomfortable, the chairs sagged, the stay at Ariel House looked as if it would be a disaster! When we complained, they moved us to # 222. What a difference! This room was very spacious ( the ceilings must be 15 feet high) everything well-maintained and it faced the tree-lined street. 
The staff is always ready to help - explaining where to go and how to get there, suggesting day trips, etc. The breakfast is wonderful!  Great variety and cooked to order.
The location is fine, away from the noise of the city and close enough to get into the main attractions. All in all, I would recommend this as a very good place to stay.",4,2017,06,21
233,Fantastic Experience,"My wife and I stayed here on Saturday the 17th June. We were attending a concert in the Aviva Stadium which is literally 100 metres away, so it was very convenient and meant we could leave everything in the bedroom as we knew it was only a few minutes walk back if we wanted anything.

The B&B is gorgeous, the building itself is incredibly impressive and the decor and rooms are wonderful.

The staff were extremely polite and very helpful and the breakfast was lovely.

This is more of a boutique hotel than a B&B, it sets itself high standards and appears to reach them from what we saw",5,2017,06,21
233,"Ariel House, a treasure!","My friend and I stayed at Ariel House when we arrived in Dublin, two days prior to meeting up with a bus tour. 

It had been recommended to us and was a lovely place to stay. It was very quaint and well located next to the Dart, to get into city centre of Dublin and then again to travel to Malahide where our tour started. 

Yes, the hotel had stairs, which is very common in Europe, but the staff were very quick to run out to help with the bags. 

The staff were very friendly and helpful. There was a lovely lobby area, more like a living room really where you could have coffee and tea and a sweet treat at the end of the day. 

There were gorgeous bouquets of flowers placed all around the hotel. Indeed, I found the hotel very fragrant....loved it!

The dining room was lovely and part of it was in a sun room. The breakfast, which was included, was freshly made for you and very delicious. There was a buffet of fruits and cold foods as well. 

The room itself was very spacious and comfortable with antique furniture. We also enjoyed spending time in the lobby reception room where we met other guests as we relaxed at the end of the day.",5,2017,06,20
233,A little gem,"Myself and 4 friends stayed here on Saturday 17th June 2017 for just one night. We would have loved to have stayed longer. 
We were attending a concert in the Aviva stadium and this was the perfect location to stay,
Upon arrival we were greeted by a very friendly lady who checked us in efficiently even though she was busy. 
Our room was just perfect. Had everything we needed and it was spotless.
We had a few drinks in the pretty garden before heading to the concert and it was beautiful and the option was there to purchase wine or bring our own.
After a great nights sleep (very comfy beds!) we had breakfast the next morning which was outstanding. The staff were so friendly and very attentive. Breakfast was varied in choice and the home made bread was divine!! 
We will most certainly be back and we will be recommending Ariel House to everybody 😊",5,2017,06,19
233,Retired travellers,"Excellent accomodation, service and location. Staff are always very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is sensational as is the tea/coffee and cakes available at all times. Just near the train station 2 short stops to access central Dublin ",5,2017,06,19
233,Quaint place but lots of steps.,We planned to be in Europe for nearly a month in different climates so we had 3 rolling bags which are not easy to get up and down the stairs. However the room is quite nice and even had a towel warmer! The staff is kind and helpful and they will get you coffee or tea any time. The train station is maybe a block a way which is extremely convenient. ,4,2017,06,18
233,Lovely hotel away from the bustle,"A very pleasant small hotel with excellent staff. The location is great - an easy half-hour walk into central Dublin and also steps away from a DART station. Bright sunny breakfast room and a great breakfast. Our room was a ""garden view"" room, which was sort of in the basement. I would recommend upstairs rooms instead. ",4,2017,06,13
233,Exceptionally Friendly ,"We walked into this hotel without pre-booking it.  We got a reasonable price.  The suite was large with a sofa and chair.  The bed was comfortable.  The place is very clean.  But what makes this place special is the hospitality of the staff.  There was tea and cakes out for us all day.  We walked to a great restaurant at their recommendation, The Old Spot, and had a wonderful meal. ",5,2017,06,09
233,A Wonderful Treat,"We had a wonderful time at Ariel House and were very sorry to leave.

The hotel is less than a 2 minute walk from the DART station up a quiet leafy road right beside the Aviva Stadium.  It is a converted Victorian house and retains all the period features and charm.  We received a very warm welcome and check-in was quick and easy.  Upon handing us our room key we were advised that we had been given an upgrade.  What a lovely surprise, I thought things like that only happened in the movies!

Our bedroom was huge with a beautiful 4 poster bed.  It was spotless and very comfortable.  The bathroom was also very large with a separate shower and bath, lovely complimentary toiletries and slippers.

Complimentary tea/coffee and cake is served in the drawing room each day.

I was a little concerned that as we were facing the street and on the ground floor (although you go up a number of steps to enter the house so it is more like the 1st floor) that there may be noise however it was a very quiet area, even with an event in the stadium, to road cleared quite quickly afterwards and was well marshalled.

Breakfast was delicious, an excellent selection of cold and hot choices and wonderful service.  Seating is limited so there was a very short wait on the Saturday morning for a table, but the staff came to get us as soon as it was available.

There was only one thing about the whole visit that I was a little unhappy about, there was a lack of hot water for a shower in the afternoon, the water could only be described as lukewarm at best!

However I would not hesitate to make a booking at this hotel again and cannot wait until we have the opportunity to visit again.

A big thank you to all the staff at Ariel House.",5,2017,06,09
233,An amazing breakfast,"The room was nice,  spacious. The bed is outstanding and the linens very comfortable. The location is excellent.  The real winner here is the breakfast.  Elegant and delicious with an amazing choice.  This is not the typical breakfast.  There is a choice of fruit, yogurt , muffins and french mini-pastries for your breakfast ""starter"" then you get an entree which has a  range of choices from buttermilk pancakes, french toast, omelettes, Eggs Benedict and of course the Irish.  The staff is excellent and the afternoon tea icing on the cake.",5,2017,06,01
233,Comfortable,"Lovely B&B in an upscale area of Dublin. Service at every level surpassed excellent. Special mention to Cecilia at the reception desk and Anna in the dining room. Close to DART and very easy to get about. Rooms were beautifully decorated. Only issue we had was we found the bed to be more along the lines of what we in North America would call a ""double"" bed and therefore somewhat cozy. Would highly recommend.",5,2017,05,30
233,"A very friendly, homely hotel","This hotel is in a leafy suburb of Dublin, close to public transport and to hop-on-hop-off bus stops. The building itself is charming with a beautiful drawing room where tea/coffee (pod machine) and home-made treats are available. The standard rooms are a bit small, the shower is over the bath-tub and air-conditioning would be a welcome improvement. Breakfast is cooked to order (plenty of choice!) and there are also bowls of fruit, pastries, cereals, home-made bread/cake available on a buffet table. The staff members are very friendly and helpful. This hotel does not have a restaurant as such, since only breakfast is available. 'Breakfast room' would probably be a more accurate description on the website.",4,2017,05,30
233,Wonderful Visit!,"We stayed 3 nights at Ariel House and loved every part of our stay! The staff was very welcoming, friendly and always able to help with suggestions! Breakfast and afternoon tea were outstanding and perfectly presented! Great location just steps away from the DART train to downtown  Dublin. We are already looking forward to a return visit to Ariel House! ❤️",5,2017,05,29
233,The breakfast :-),What a fabulous little gem! The staff at check in were so welcoming and hospitable and the rooms so comfortable and clean. The breakfast was a real highlight. A real home away from home! I am already looking forward to going back.,5,2017,05,29
233,Spectacular B&B!,"My wife and I booked a 3-night stay at the stately Ariel House and absolutely loved the place. We had a very large room on the 1st floor that was more like a grand apartment in Paris or London than a mere hotel room-Incredibly spacious and beautifully appointed in classic furnishings. And at a cost of under 300 euro per night, including a cooked to order breakfast, the Ariel House is easily the single-greatest value in high quality accommodations I've ever experienced personally in my years of travel. The location in the tony neighborhood of Ballsbridge was perfect for us. Quiet, clean and upscale. We love to walk and all the major tourist sites along the Liffey River were 20-45 minutes away by foot. Yet we were always happen to return to the elegant neighborhood where the Ariel House resides. For those who prefer using the public transportation, the train into central Dublin, stops 75 yards from the Ariel's front door. A number of nice pubs and bistros are within 5-10 min walk. If you don't mind a good leg stretcher and prefer to be a little outside of the tourist hub, the Ariel House is the perfect, genteel home base to explore Dublin's many delights!",5,2017,05,29
233,Holiday in Dublin,"We loved our stay at Ariel House!  It was quiet enough for us to get good sleep but close enough to the action of pubs.  The staff were friendly and helpful, by far the food was our favorite part though!  Amazing breakfast.",5,2017,05,29
233,Wonderful Small Hotel,"I have been to Dublin many time and stayed at other hotels, but Ariel House has been the best of them.  We were so well treated and the staff were amazing kind.  Even though we arrived very late (23:30), they brought us tea and cakes to the room.  In the morning, we went to breakfast in the hotel - OMG it was amazing.  When we came back in the late afternoon, there was tea and cakes in the lounge.  We felt so spoiled.

The room was very nice and cozy.  It was quiet even though it was just off the lobby.

I will happily stay there again the next time I am in Dublin.",5,2017,05,28
233,Wonderful B&B,This is an exceptional B&B and almost felt like a high-end hotel.  The staff is very friendly and accessible 24 hours a day.  The room was lovely and the parlor area is gorgeous with delicious treats and tea/coffee.  The surrounding neighborhood is beautiful and we were able to walk to the City Centre (we like to walk--it was about 25 minutes)--also a very quick taxi ride if walking is not your thing.  I would highly recommend this place.,5,2017,05,28
233,Oasis in Dublin,"An oasis of cheerful smiling Irish eyes and wonderful hospitality. Very comfortable, clean, cozy, with delicious breakfast meals. Although 1st level required a flight of stairs, receptionist immediately had staff bring our bags up for us.  She insisted that we relax in the spacious parlor and offered tea or coffee while we waited for our room to be readied, since did arrive hours before usual check-in  time.  6 plus on a 5 point scale! Art",5,2017,05,27
233,Lovely B&B,"Wonderful Bed & Breakfast on the outskirts of Dublin.  A bit of a walk to the City Centre, so be prepared.  The staff was very friendly and our room was lovely and clean.  Great breakfast!  Definitely would recommend.",5,2017,05,25
233,Excellent for relaxing. Great location,"The Ariel House is an excellent B&B in the nicer parts of Dublin. It is in walking distance from many great restaurants and bars.  They always have tea, coffee and pastries out and available for the guests. After a long day exploring Dublin, it was nice to return and have a cup of tea and butter cookies or cake.  The manager Bria (Spelling) was very helpful in answering questions for us. No matter the time of day, there was someone at Ariel House able to assist with even minor things.  The rooms were well appointed. Request the family room if there are 3 people staying in your group. The family room was more spacious than the room that sleeps 3, and it has a couch.",5,2017,05,24
233,"First rate, and nice people","We enjoyed our stay at Ariel House.  The people are nice, the breakfasts are excellent, and the location is only a block away from the Dart train that takes you into central Dublin.  If you're a rugby fan, it's one block from Aviva Stadium.  Downsides: our room was quite small, there's not much parking (fortunately we had no car), and the breakfast area has fewer seats than guests, so you hope the timing is fortuitous (or someone will wait).  Simple but pleasant tea in the afternoon. And the staff are all gracious and pleasant.  We'd be happy to stay again if we come back to Dublin.  ",4,2017,05,24
233,A great place to start our Ireland adventure.,"The property is beautiful, The staff is wonderful and the breakfast included with our stay was excellent.  The was very helpful in making various reservations and suggestions of things to do.  The rooms were spacious and impeccably clean.  I would highly recommend it.",5,2017,05,24
233,"I would go back for the brown bread alone, don't mind everything else!!","We stayed at Ariel house on our last visit home and very quickly decided, it would become our ""go to"" place for all future visits!  The staff were so welcoming and friendly and full of chat to the kids as well.  The decor is traditional and so tasteful, you very much feel like you are experiencing something unique - Ariel house definitely sets itself apart in the market and is not easy forget for all the right reasons.  The breakfasts are incredible, the perfect cure for the inevitable late nights and over indulgence that goes hand in hand with a night out in Dublin.  The rooms were so clean and the free wifi was a big bonus to entertain the kids when suffering from jet-lag!  The location is perfect, a stone throw to the city yet set in a relatively quiet, leafy suburb - we will 100% be back and could not recommend more.  Great job to all involved!",5,2017,05,21
233,"Top location, yet surprisingly quiet","Ariel House is walking distance from the high street of Ballsbridge and is quite close to Dublin city centre. Rooms are spacious; when in the room, I could not hear any noise. Excellent breakfast. Overall, it's what I would call a `family-run guest house' experience, as opposed to hotels with hunderds of rooms and long corridors. Cannot say anything about the prices - was on a business trip, did not book the room myself.",5,2017,05,20
233,"Charming, gracious guest house in lovely neighborhood","This beautiful guest house is a perfect spot in Dublin's elegant Ballsbridge neighborhood. Close enough to city center, but out of the fray and chaos. The staff are extremely welcoming and helpful and the accommodations are top notch. Our room was beautifully appointed and comfortable--high ceilings, lovely decor, and a nice soaking tub--perfect after a long day of sightseeing. There is a lovely parlor with a fireplace and huge windows where guests can sit and relax, fix an espresso, nibble on sweets, or order a pot of tea. The breakfast room is sunny and cozy and the wait staff are really on top of things--quick, helpful, and friendly. The breakfasts are swoon-worthy--nice buffet of fruit, cereal and baked goods, and an extensive hot menu made to order. Highly recommend the poached eggs with smoked salmon. I would definitely return to Ariel House next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2017,05,19
233,Friendly hotel,"I Cannot fault Ariel House, we had a lovely stay whilst visiting Dublin for a friend's wedding.  The location is very convenient for the city centre.  We caught the dart train which is on the door step and took just a few minutes by train to the centre.

The rooms are very large for the price with beautiful high ceilings.  The breakfast had a very large selection of buffet items and delicious cooked to order hot and cold food.  We will be back when we return to Dublin.",5,2017,05,19
233,Stay here!,This was a super place to stay in Dublin. Beautiful room full of period charm. Excellent breakfast with a wide ranging menu. Very friendly staff! Very close to the city centre which we walked to. Tops all round!!,5,2017,05,17
233,A lovely B&B in convenient but quiet neighborhood (unless there is a match at Aviva),"We spent 6 nights in this very pleasant B&B in Dublin. The building dates from the Victorian era and it's parlor, ideal for sitting, having tea and snacks, is reminiscent of the period as well.  The B&B actually occupies 3 connected buildings. The rooms are small but perfectly fine, well appointed and well kept.  The dining area is bright, overlooks the garden and is a great place to start the day. The choices from breakfast are varied though traditional. The brown bread is the best we had and made on the premises. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful in planning one's day as needed.  The neighborhood is quiet, although it must get very busy and loud if there happens to be a match at the nearby Aviva Statdium, so it would be good to check on the schedule there before booking.  Although removed from the center of the city, Ariel House is a 5 minute (or less) walk to a DART station and within 10 minutes you are in the heart of the city.  The only caveat is that  getting to the reception desk or to many of the rooms requires climbing or descending stairs so if that is a problem form someone then this may not be the place.  Other than that I can highly recommend Ariel house as a place to stay during a trip to London.  In chats with various guests it was apparent that there were a number of repeat visitors, which speaks volumes about the quality of this B&B.  There is free wifi but reception was spotty in our room but fine in the parlor.  I would definitely stay there again if I were to go return to Dublin.",4,2017,05,16
233,Nice location and great breakfast,"Stayed here for 2 nights. The staff are friendly, helpful and cater to your needs. The B&B is very nice, the room was clean, bed comfortable and the breakfast was great. It is a short walk to public transportation, we had no problem getting to where all the shopping, pubs and restaurants are. The only issues I had were, the water pressure was a little low, but not horrible and the people above us walked around a lot. Not the B&B's fault but I would ask for a room on a higher level next time.",4,2017,05,15
233,Excellent and could be five star with some tweaks,"First, the staff are just amazing. They have great, helpful spirits and accommodated an early check-in for us so we could nap after a long flight. The breakfasts are stellar and have long hours of service. The rooms are good size and the location is lovely and quiet, if a bit of a walk to Dublin proper (30 min each way, but there is a DART station a block away). The water pressure is amazing with lots of hot water, and internet was good in our room. Now, the items needing a serious refresh: The beds in our room were older, hard, and a bit saggy. The pillows were like thin slabs of hard fiber. The carpet, well, the carpet is just in pretty bad shape throughout and feels pretty gross under bare feet. If you want to control the climate in your room to make things cooler, you cannot. All and all, we would come back for the people and food.  But, with some adjustments this place could be amazing.",4,2017,05,15
233,Afternoon tea,"Afternoon tea here was well worth for a visit for the cakes,the cakes were gorgeous but the sandwiches left a lot to be desired. The selection was poor and lacked flavour and variety. I also think there should been a selection of different teas and scones should have been larger and left plain as not everyone likes cream and jam on their scones.",3,2017,05,13
233,Very happy with our choice,"As first time visitors to Dublin we selected our hotel based on online reviews, google maps and whether or not I could book using my frequent flyer points (and, of course how many points were required). We were not disappointed. The room was comfortable (but don't expect the double bed to be any more than that!), staff pleasant and breakfast very good. The train to Dublin's tourist spots is a 1 minute walk and 2 stops (and 2.2 euro). No restaurant on site (it's a b&b), but there are plenty to choose from nearby.",4,2017,05,13
233,"Very quiet, very comfortable, wonderful place","We spent 3 nights at Ariel House in April 2017. It was wonderful. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable. The bed and its pillows (a big thing with me) were very very comfortable and it was very quiet at night. After flying in from the US the first night and 2 days of miles of site seeing it was the perfect place to get a good night's sleep.

The breakfast was wonderful with many options. I especially loved the porridge and the stewed cinnammon apples on the buffet.

My only negative and it is mixed between negative/positive was the distance from the center of town. We walked it every day if not twice a day. On the one hand it is a very pleasant stroll away from the tourist crowds giving a glimpse of everyday Dublin but it was a hike to and fro. There is a bus nearby.",4,2017,05,11
233,Good location ,"We stayed here when we went to a concert in the Olympia.  It was a good walk from here to St. Stephen's Green but we had a few pit stops. We managed to squeeze into the tiny car park in front but it looks like there's a rear car park if necessary.  The room was quite basic.  Very clean.  Wifi wasn't accessible despite a code being given to us to use.  We didn't spend long there before heading into the city.  When we returned we were granted access by a very pleasant man. 
Breakfast was served by two very pleasant ladies.  Great choice.  My husband ordered full Irish but said he would have liked a little bit more to feel satisfied.  I was very happy with poached eggs and salmon.  When checking out, the lady on reception wasn't that friendly.  If she had asked I would have said that there appears to be an issue with pipes making a terrible racket when other guests are showering.  It was loud enough to waken me and I'm a very heavy sleeper.  Still I did like this place and the lovely ladies who serve breakfast.  ",4,2017,05,07
233,Lovely  B&B,"Great stay at Ariel House. The building and rooms are good and location is excellent with Dart and buses very nearby and the air coach stop less than 10 minutes walk.

The staff were the lovely- went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect and had great local tips.

What really takes this place a cut above is the fantastic breakfasts and the afternoon snacks in the drawing room. The food was really excellent - lots of choice and really tasty.

All in all a great vase in Dublin.",5,2017,05,04
233,Fantastic Stay!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Ariel House. Our vacation was off to a rough start with delayed flights and lost baggage but every single staff member was polite, pleasant, and beyond helpful. We arrived at the Ariel House at about 1130 and check-in is not until 1400. The manager on duty allowed us to wait for our room in the drawing room and brought us tea. She was very welcoming. I cannot say enough nice things about this place or the employees that work here. We walked into the dining room after breakfast had stopped being served but the waitress on duty allowed us to grab a quick bite from the buffet and made sure we were taken care of. She also was very friendly and went above and beyond. The other concierge on duty was so helpful! I can't think of her name but she helped print my vouchers for our vacation and even offered to help us get to our lost luggage. She also went above and beyond! We walked all over Dublin during our three day stay and the location was perfect. A few restaurants were near by and we got lots of walking in! My husband and I are staying in Ireland for two weeks and I was a bit upset that we had to leave Dublin this morning. I wouldn't have minded staying the entire two weeks at the Ariel
House. I will definitely recommend this Bed and Breakfast to anyone that is traveling to Dublin and I will definitely stay here again when I come back!",5,2017,05,04
233,Afternoon tea ... a mediocre experience,"I dont like giving poor reviews but consider my recent aftrernoon tea experience to have been so poor I have to comment.This place has got fantastic reviews and on paper is a great experience, friendly, and so on ...we went there thinking that it would be fantastic it wasent ...not our worst experience but overall passable...there was no friendly welcome, we eat in a middling B&B breakfast room, the sanwithches while abundent lacked finess, the cakes were good, staff were efficient but unfriendly... but this was not the Shelbourne or Marlfield House or anything like. Overall it was a waste of time and leaves me questioning previous reviews ....in summary our expectations were in line with the fabulous reviews which were not met there was no finesse everything was average or below... we wont be back",2,2017,04,27
233,2nd Visit,"This was our 2nd Visit & we bought friends this time. We where not disappointed. Great staff, lovely big rooms, comfy beds, amazing breakfast. Sitting in the drawing room with a cup of tea & some of the tasty cakes or shortbread in an afternoon is a real treat. We will be back for a 3rd visit. ",5,2017,04,26
233,Excellent Bed and Breakfast with Old World Charm!,"Nestled on a quite residential street on the outskirts of city center Dublin, The Ariel House is a true gem!  This B&B has old world charm and a wonderful, friendly staff.  The DART station is literally a few minutes walk down the street, making it super easy to get to the city center.  Breakfast options were varied and delicious and served in the sun room overlooking the gardens.  The only cons were plumbing issues and limited, tight parking.  Overall, it was a wonderful place to stay at a very reasonable price.  We would highly recommend The Ariel House!",5,2017,04,25
233,Pleasant stay,"The rooms are what you'd expect in an older bed and breakfast but we went into it knowing what we would encounter. While the rooms are dated (understandably so,) the room size is very spacious. The hotel itself is also located just minutes away from a train station.

The staff was very welcoming and helpful with any questions we brought to them. The breakfast was fantastic as well. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2017,04,16
233,Some rooms are very poor,"The hotel is good for accessing the Aviva stadium. Staff are pleasant and helpful. Breakfasts are of a good standard. The lounge is lovely - tea and coffee with small cakes available during the day. The furniture in rooms is ""period"", some could do with maintenance. We were told that our room was a Garden Room. As I walked down the stairs I had a lovely picture in my mind. When I opened the door to the room I was literally horrified! It was large with two double beds, but so dingy. Two small windows overlooked the interior of what I took to be a garage/car port. Two step ladders were leaning at one window. As I looked out of the other all I could see was a pile of boxes. Absolutely no thought had been given to the comfort of guests using this room. The dated tv worked intermittently. The hand basin took an eternity to drain. My visit to Ariel House was totally ruined. As we were staying along with American friends, who had a far better room, I did not want to make a fuss. Being in the room was so depressing. I cannot remember ever having stayed in such a poor room. I was so disappointed.",3,2017,04,15
233,Wonderful!,"It was Beautiful, lovely, and accommodating! The beds were comfortable, the staff very helpful. The breakfast room and food were awesome. Will think of them when my husband reminisce about out time in Dublin. They prepared us little breakfast baggies to bring along on our day tour because we were leaving before breakfast. ",5,2017,04,12
233,Beautiful Lodge,"We stayed here for one night in April - the lodge is really beautiful and we were given a warm and friendly welcome. The location is perfect and our stay was really relaxing and enjoyable with some extra personal touches that really made our stay!!! 
Breakfast was very nice and of a higher standard than many hotels i have stayed in. It was also served by the extremely friendly staff, in the beautiful light filled dining room.
Would definitely stay here again and would have no hesitation in recommending Ariel House.",5,2017,04,10
233,Delightful Hotel in Dublin,"We stayed 2 nights in room 222 of this nice hotel.  It turns out that this is the George Bernard Shaw room!  This is one of those hotels in a quaint, older building.  There is a small yard/garden area in the front of the hotel that makes it very friendly and homey.  Although the parking lot is small, parking is available at no extra charge.  The breakfast room was very inviting with nice decorations.  Part of the breakfast room extended into a glass enclosed area allowing one to experience the early morning sky.  The food was excellent, as was the service.  As with several other hotels we were in, the breakfast included both a cold continental breakfast and a menu that allows one to order a hot breakfast (included).  The hotel has a public sitting area with a fireplace where one could avail themselves of coffee, tea, and an occasional pastry.  The room was spacious and well decorated.  The bathroom was modern and up-to-date.  For those who like to use public transportation, it was a short walk to the train station and a trip into downtown Dublin.  All in all this was a very enjoyable experience.",5,2017,04,07
233,A Diamond in Emerald Dublin,"Where to begin? Ariel House is beautiful and in a wonderful location in the lovely Ballsbridge area of Dublin - far from the madding crowds of downtown - but very accessible to everything. This is the Embassy District. Lots of smart young professional-looking commuters dashing about as well as families with baby strollers and happy dogs with their walkers.
The blossoms and mature trees added to the delightful surroundings of this elegant Victorian guest house. Much of the interior is original with lovely upgrades including the ensuite bath and the breakfast conservatory where the friendly staff served a wonderful meal to start the day.
The staff were exceptionally kind, efficient, and helpful. It was lovely to come ""home"" each day to the warm and cozy sitting room with tea and treats awaiting.
There are excellent restaurants in the area, including Roly's and The Crowe Pub.
We miss it already and most certainly hope to return.
",5,2017,04,07
233,First Class Victorian Townhouse!,"What an enjoyable B&B. The people are so warm and friendly at Ariel House. It is like we have known them for years. Fabulous hospitality! The rooms and bathrooms are large, clean and roomy. The afternoon tea, coffee and treats are an added bonus. It is about a block from the rail that goes into the city center. The professional stadium is nearby as well. So glad we booked Ariel House. Wonderful. We plan to bring a group of 25 in a few months. We can't wait for them to stay here!",5,2017,04,06
233,A wonderful Inn/B&B in Dublin,"The Ariel House is a delightful Inn/B&B made up of three 19th C townhouses connected into a single Inn.  It is located very near the Aviva (Rugby) stadium with easy access to the local light rail transit system and within easy walking distance of several very good restaurants.  Speaking of food, I must mention the included breakfast--you have several choices from a menu that changes daily.  Anything you choose is individually prepared and delicious.  My wife and I were sure to be on time for breakfast each morning.

We particularly enjoyed spending time in the Drawing Room where coffee and tea were always available along with an afternoon selection of cakes and other snacks, all prepared on site.  The Drawing Room was a place for the guests to meet, have tea and a snack and talk.  We had several conversations with two couples visiting from Australia as well as other encounters with people from Ireland and several other EU countries.

Parking is somewhat limited but was adequate during our visit.

This visit was worth every dime we invested in our stay.  When we revisit Dublin, this will absolutely be our choice of place to stay.",5,2017,04,03
233,Fabulous,"Stayed here on the 28/03/2017 for the Irish match, and I have to say it's an amazing place to stay, the place is spotless the rooms are very well presented and the bed is very comfortable. It's right next to the Aviva stadium so it was perfect for us. The breakfast was delicious, food was quality and the staff are very friendly. Especially the chap who served us breakfast, he was a pleasant and helpful lad. The only downside to it is I couldn't stay longer 😢 I would highly recommend it to anyone, and I will be back again.",5,2017,03,29
233,Fantastic B&B,"We want to Dublin to watch the England rugby match at The Aviva Stadium, and we were so lucky to have found such a fabulous B&B.
The accommodation is excellent, and the location not just for the rugby but for visiting the city is ideal.
The staff were super friendly, and Jennie who runs it is an absolute asset. She's very efficient, professional and was great at recommending and booking restaurants etc.
One of the highlights is their breakfast. There's a great choice and it's delicious.
The next time we visit Dublin we will certainly return to The Ariel House.",5,2017,03,23
233,Fantastic stay in a fab hotel,"Fab place to stay, lovely comfortable rooms, fantastic friendly, helpful staff. Complimentary coffee and nibbles in the comfortable guest lounge.
Best breakfast we have ever had.
5 star treatment,.
Highly recommend Ariel House",5,2017,03,23
233,Welcoming home away from home,"We stayed for 5 nights earlier this month. Every staff member was very welcoming, friendly and helpful. Breakfast was amazing - both a cold buffet and hot meals made to order in an attractive dining room with lots of light. Conveniently located steps away from a DART station and bus stops. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2017,03,22
233,Friendly and welcoming -  a perfect weekend stay,"My husband and I, along with another couple stayed here for 2 nights.  A perfect guest house on all levels - rooms, location and above all wonderful staff.  The rooms were comfortable, well presented and very clean, breakfast was fantastic and location being so close to the Aviva stadium was more than ideal for seeing as we were her to watch the rugby.  Above all, Jennie and her wonderful team of staff were amazing.  They were all very friendly, attentive and so helpful in helping make our stay such a good one.",5,2017,03,21
233,"Wonderful accommodations, friendly, helpful staff, couldn't have asked for more!","Our family traveled to Dublin in March 2017 for vacation.  Ariel House far exceeded our expectations!  First, it was in a very nice, upscale area. We arrived quite early, were greeted warmly, given coffee and treats and able to get into our room very early.  The room was a family suite--very spacious clean and comfortable.  The breakfast was amazing and delicious.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  We would highly recommend Ariel House and would go back in a heartbeat!",5,2017,03,18
233,Nice place to stay,"My wife stayed at the Ariel House for 1 night as we were traveling around Ireland. Place was clean and friendly staff. Hall ways could be a little noisy due to older construction but over all it was a good place to stay. They had breakfast in he morning which we did not gat to take advantage of due to an early tee time I had at the golf course and then it was off to Galway, but it looked very good and smelled great. 

The wifi was a little weak, but if I moved in just the right spot in my room I could get a good enough connection to use FaceTime to contact our kids back in the states. 

One of the good things is the hop-on hop-off bus stop was just a short walk away, as were some nice pubs to hit up for dinner and drinks. You could actually see the soccer stadium right up the street. I would definitely stay there again if I ever go back to visits Dublin again. ",4,2017,03,16
233,Excellent Stay ,"We stayed in the James Joyce room with a four poster bed and the best mattress I've ever had in any hotel, really comfortable. 
The staff are very friendly, there is complimentary tea and coffee and nibbles in the drawing room.  The breakfast is the best I've come across by far, beautifully presented and great variety. 
Great location, great place to stay. ",5,2017,03,14
233,Tiny expensive dark room,"Warm welcome, but then huge disappointment. Our tiny expensive room was under the main building stairs. Very small bed (1,20m for 2 adult). The heating  did not work in the bathroom, no way to dry you in there, too cold. They install another heater in the bathroom for the night. Could not close anymore the bathroom door, From freezing the bathroom turn into a sauna (and so our room) ! When informing the management, their question was: 'did you ever been in Dublin before????? Breakfast was nice but had to wait 20 minutes to be seated !!",1,2017,03,14
233,Staff - hospitality second to none.,"What a lovely place in every way. Just loved it - excellent in every aspect but the staff are outstanding. Everyone I met gave superb service. Clearly well trained, but more than that - a genuine, friendly, caring approach. Nothing too much trouble. Lovely. Thanks to you all for making my Dublin stay extra special.",5,2017,03,12
233,Excellent.,"Very nice and comfortable period guest house in a leafy Dublin suburb. One minute walk to the DART train service which brings you to city centre in 5 minutes. Very convenient for Aviva or RDS too. Rooms nice , clean and comfortable. Service very good with friendly people throughout. Breakfast deserves a special mention. Top quality cooked to order and a lovely selection on the buffet too. We have already booked out next stay . ",5,2017,03,11
233,Pleasant stay and wonderful staff! ,"I stayed at Ariel house last week, and I have to say that it was one of the most pleasant stays at hotel or guesthouse I've had. The friendly and caring staff and the outstanding breakfast are just some of the many excellent elements of this establishment ",5,2017,03,06
233,Truly a gem!,"I have been coming to Dublin for about 5 years and I try to visit twice a year for somewhat extended stays, usually 10 days or more.  I have only stayed at Ariel House, which has spoiled me for all of Ireland and really all of my travels.  Ariel House is simply a gem.  

Ariel House excels at all the usual things one would expect:  bright, airy rooms, extremely clean, great location, wonderful breakfast, excellent staff.   

Everyone seems to justifiably rave about the breakfast.  My first trip I arrived with a guest after breakfast had technically closed but the staff offered the hot breakfast while the room was being readied.  Coming off a delayed all night flight it was the perfect introduction to Irish hospitality and Ariel House.  I have often seen this accommodation offered to other guests, and also to those with very early flights.  Jennie and Diedre have assembled a fantastic team.  The motto at Ariel House seems to be “We’ll make it work!”

The front room is one of Ariel House’s best features, and I have met many interesting and wonderful people.  I tend to spend more time in the front room than most, and it’s allowed me to watch and listen to the staff in action.  They are universally helpful to all guests, and really go above and beyond to make sure that all reasonable requests are accommodated. The staff has great attention to detail.  As one would expect, the staff offers helpful tips that just make things so much better, for example, Hailo is a better “taxi” value than Uber in Dublin, something I would not have known.  A small point perhaps, but one of the minor things that all add up to a wonderful trip.  

All visitors to Dublin should consider Ariel House.  It’s simply the best!

Respectfully Submitted,

Michael G. Brautigam",5,2017,03,05
233,Great little Hotel,"As per all the other reviews, we booked after reading the reviews, and were not disappointed,
On arrival we were upgraded to a suite, it had to large windows, so plenty of light came into the room.
The lounge was nice to relax in after a days looking around, cakes,biscuits and coffee/tea laid out for self service.

As said before, Breakfast is very very good.

 They have parking for about 7 vehicles on the forecourt, it's a 1st come first parked system, we were lucky, parking on the road is chargeable.

Staff were excellent even printing us of maps for the way back to the airport.

The Aviva stadium is 100 metres along the road, they do tours for euro 10, takes about an hour. The DART train system is just before the stadium, and it's 3 stops to the the centre . about Euro 4 return.

Would have been nice if they had a small honesty bar or Bar, but I guess there is no demand for it.

We would stay here again if in Dublin",5,2017,03,03
233,Best hotel experience in Dublin !!,"We only stayed one night and as it was a last minute booking on a busy weekend in Dublin - we were not sure what to expect ! However, from the minute we arrived to a beautiful welcome, with teas & coffees and homemade pastries upon check-in and excellent customer service - we knew we had found a gem !
The room we stayed in was to the front of the building and was furnished beautifully- very spacious, comfortable and very clean.   Breakfast was amazing and the staff were very helpful and friendly.
Location was ideal for us - I would have no hesitation to wholeheartedly recommend a stay and we are looking forward to our return trip !!",5,2017,03,01
233,Wonderful service,"We really enjoyed our 3 night stay at Aerial House. The room was spacious clean and comfortable. The staff were all v welcoming and nothing was too much trouble including coffee and cakes on the sideboard in the lounge on our return every afternoon /eve. 
The breakfast was exceptional e.g.  scones , Irish cheeses and apples poached with cinnamon ! Plus lots of hot options to choose from inc  full Irish to pancakes ! Staff v attentive too! 
Great place to stay x",5,2017,02,27
233,Unique and charming hotel,"I found this a very friendly and nice place to stay for one night in Dublin. The hotel has a very relaxed and quiet atmosphere and my room was large, neat and clean.
Very friendly staff and excellent breakfast!",5,2017,02,26
233,Everything was just perfect ,"We stayed for three nights off season. We loved just everything. The staff is fantastic, so polite and helpful. Especially enjoyed our evening chats with Luisz, who is the sweetest. Our room was elegant and comfortable, the breakfast is something to remember. We feel well rested and will definitely return. ",5,2017,02,23
233,Very accommodating and friendly!,"This was the first place we stayed at in Dublin and they set the standards high for the rest of our trip! We felt very welcomed right away and everyone was so helpful throughout our stay. Our room was cozy and our bathroom was very nice! Breakfast in the morning was great and we definitely got our fill. All of the staff was so kind to us and made our stay that much better. Even though it is outside of the city, we were able to walk into town in about 20 minutes. I would highly recommend staying here!",5,2017,02,21
233,"Good, Better, Best","The Good: We stayed in a standard room, which was much larger than I was expecting. It was nice and quiet for sleeping, although there were a few minor points about the room that could do with fixing - scuffed walls and tiny television. The bed was nice and comfortable though. Ariel House's location is also good, very near to public transport to the city, or if you're up for a long walk, the area is safe. 

Better: The breakfast was INCREDIBLE. Seriously. If you stay here for breakfast alone, you won't be disappointed. The hot breakfast is made to order, with both starters and mains available on the menu. Everything is presented beautifully and you can really eat it with your eyes as well. There is also a lovely afternoon tea available every day in the sitting room area with homemade cakes, biscuits and more. 

The Best: The staff! The staff went out of their way at every opportunity to make your stay better. Luisz at Reception and Anna at breakfast were notably great. Luisz was so kind and welcoming and was a great example of what reception staff should be like - he also never failed to offer us a cup of tea or coffee, no matter what time we walked into the hotel. Anna was also just amazing, making time to joke and talk with everyone. On the first morning, my husband had asked for an apple, which was unfortunately unavailable. The next morning, we found that Anna had gone out of her way to make sure that there was a perfect red apple waiting for him at the table for breakfast! 

It's the little things at this hotel that make it great. We can't wait to be back in March!",5,2017,02,21
233,"good location for town, fabulous location for sport - perfect bed, great breakfast","Second time in Ariel House and we have promised  ourselves that the  next time  we will be staying longer - full weekend. The location is great  for the  Aviva and the east wall as well as that  side  of  town. 5 mins from the coast  and 10 mins from the  heart  of Dublin. the  fact  the DART station is so close makes the north side  of Dublin Bay  less than 20 mins away.  But .... the  welcome, the  rooms, and the peace and quite make  it feel like you are a million miles from the  heart  of  a capital city. The  food in the  morning is brilliant.  we were there as a couple and we loved it. looking forward to getting back soon.... for the  rugby of course. :-)",5,2017,02,20
233,LOVELY first lodging in Ireland -- Breakfast is to die for!!,"This was our first lodging on our trip to Ireland and it was absolutely gorgeous. Whenever anyone asks me, I always describe the Ariel House as a boutique hotel.  Not a B&B, but not an impersonal big hotel either.  My husband I absolutely loved our stay here.

The Ariel House is three (I think) Victorian connected townhouses (right in the shadow of Aviva Stadium), and it's quirky and adorable. Our room (Superior) was comfortable and a lovely place to retreat to after a long day of tooling around Dublin. I was a little unsure how big/cramped the room would be, but it was just right.

Our flight arrived a few hours before check-in, but the staff were so kind to accomodate us and get us checked in on arrival so we could unpack and unwind before setting off to explore.  The hotel is right by Aviva Stadium and a DART station, which made it super easy to get in and out of the heart of Dublin.  But, it's also not a bad walk either, if you're so inclined, and takes you through the Georgian district.

But, BREAKFAST!  If I lived in Dublin, I think I might just show up for breakfast every day.  There is an ample buffet table, as well as absolutely delish selections from a hot menu. The first morning, I had my first sampling of an Irish breakfast -- which was yummy.  BUT... the next morning, I was about to order when the waitress walked by with someone else's pancakes (topped with creme and berries) and I said, ""Oh no... I want that!""

I have spent the last six months trying to figure out how to replicate them.

Thank you to everyone at the Ariel House for making our first stop memorable...  from checking us in early to answering any questions to calling a car for us when we needed to return to the airport to pick up a rental...  When we come back to Ireland, we'll be staying with you!",5,2017,02,16
233,My favorite home away from home!,"I visit Dublin 3-4 times a year because my kids and grandson live there, albeit in a house too small to accommodate Granny.  I am so lucky that the Ariel House is across the street!  The important thing to recognize about the Irish system is that a Guest House is different from both a B&B and a hotel.  Unlike B&Bs, Guest Houses have a lounge/living room area for use by all the guests.  But unlike hotels, they don't have restaurants and bars, i.e., lots of strangers coming and going.  This Momma Bear size and homey atmosphere is just exactly the kind of environment that I love.  At the Ariel House, you also get caring personal attention from Jenny, Dierdre and Cecilia, along with a fabulous breakfast and afternoon tea with wonderful cakes.  Oh, and the place is really clean and the beds are comfortable!  Love it!",5,2017,02,12
233,Really great town house,"We stayed a weekend at Ariel house. It was perfect! the staff was friendly and helpful. Good location (1 km to city center) and right next to a train station. We had a very nice, quite room. Would definitely go back. Highly recommend this place. ",5,2017,02,12
233,Disappointed by furnishings,"Lovely staff. Grand old building. Superb breakfast. Decent towels. Good location for DART. But...

Tired furniture and fittings. Very poor wifi. Noisy floorboards. No Kleenex. Micro TV. Slightly grubby. Cold, no spare blanket. ",3,2017,02,06
233,Fantastic breakfast,"I stayed here on a business trip and was not disappointed. A beautiful house in abreast setting. Lots of steps up to the house which can be a bit tricky for luggage. Had a lovely bedroom at the front of the house, a very comfortable room, with lovely furniture.
The breakfast, however, is the best part! Delicious fruit, stewed and really tasty, yummy home made brown bread toasted, great selection of home baking, but the pancakes are worth staying for alone! Nice staff too.",5,2017,02,02
233,"Lovely hotel, but a couple of quibbles.","We chose the Ariel house for our last night in Dublin, mostly due to the rave reviews of the caring staff and the breakfast.  We booked directly through the hotel website.
My mom and I requested a room on a lower floor, as I had had surgery on my legs the day previous and found stairs difficult, which I specified in my booking.  

Either they did not have a room or they did not remember the request, because we were given a room upstairs.  This was disappointing as for all the accolades given to the staff and their attention to detail and customer service I was unhappy that I had to struggle up and down a staircase with luggage one day post operatively. The request was never mentioned or acknowledged.

When we got our room key, it was casually mentioned that we had paid for ""room only"", i.e. no breakfast.  I do not remember that being an option on the website and nowhere on their site did I see a price for the breakfast, so we were surprised to find out that it was not included.  The next unfortunate surprise was that the breakfast started too late for us to even have it as we had to go to the airport the next morning too early to enjoy it.  I had to ask if we could be accommodated with a something to go, which we did get.  But I thought this would have been offered when we expressed our disappointment that we would not be able to enjoy breakfast there.

The room itself was large and lovely, with double beds for each of us which was fantastic.  The decor was elegant and the hotel well situated, if a little out of city centre, and reasonably priced.  The bathroom was spacious and modern.  Everything was very clean and some Barry's tea and cookies were left in the room which was much appreciated. There was a bit of an issue with certain light switches powering certain outlets that left us a bit challenged in figuring out how to maintain power to our electronic devices while turning the lights off to sleep, which was annoying at the end of a long travel day.  But overall the room was very good.

But I couldn't help feeling a bit let down by the customer service aspect of our stay.  I am not usually a needy guest but had exceptional circumstances that I did advise the hotel about at the time of booking.  If they could not offer a room without a climb I would have appreciated knowing that ahead of time and having the option to make other arrangements.",4,2017,02,01
233,Fantastic stay,Staying here for 3 nights its about 1.5 miles away from the city which is a 20 mins walk. The staff here are very helpful and friendly in the morning breakfast is great I would give 10 out of 10 for the food and the service tea coffee and cakes available in the front room of which you can sit in there and chill and read. The chap on front desk in the evening is very helpful a credit to the front of house I would recommend to anyone 😊,5,2017,01,30
233,Victorian value,"Superb value for money in this characterful Victorian house, actually three houses joined together. Very good breakfast, overall this place punches above its weight. Very nice Dublin welcome, tea and cake always on hand in cold weather ",5,2017,01,29
233,City Break,"Fabulous hospitality, with some luxury thrown in. Two double beds in room which were extremely comfortable great nights sleep.Brilliant breakfast. Couldn't do enough for you. Next to Rugby ground Lansdown Road. Bus stop 5 mins away into city. 20 mins walk",5,2017,01,29
233,What a gem!,"This was a great place, a little off the beaten path but still close to many attractions via transit or walking . The staff are very welcoming and helpful to find eateries within walking distance. The service was terrific and the breakfast exceptional- still missing those scones!!",4,2017,01,21
233,"Enormous, charming room. Very relaxing.","I was very happy with my stay at Ariel House. The room was comfortable and spacious, the breakfast was quite good, and the hotel staff had good recommendations for restaurants and pubs in the area. I stayed here overnight before heading to the airport and I had a rental car, so I can't speak to its accessibility from the city center, as I was visiting County Meath via car prior to staying at the hotel. However, it was easy to get to by car and parking was easy and convenient.",5,2017,01,20
233,Lovely B & B,"I arrived a bit early and was immediately escorted to the lounge to sit down while they set about getting my room ready for me, despite the fact I had already told them it was no bother to wait. 
The room itself was lovely, my only issue was trying to find the main light switches, which were hidden behind the bed, but I got there eventually. 

 Staff were helpful and friendly, always ready to greet you with a smile. Breakfast was fantastic, a brilliant buffet supplemented by hot food cooked to order. I was particularly found of the banana bread. 

In the afternoons and evenings, cakes are set out in the lounge along with complimentary tea and coffee, or water if preferred. This provided a lovely social aspect to the evenings as I could curl up with a book, while occasionally conversing with the staff and other guests. 

Transport links are good, as the DART station is literally a minute down the road, and once on-board, does not take long to reach the city centre. 

I would highly recommend Ariel House, and would definitely stay there again if I found myself back in Dublin.",5,2017,01,13
233,Great B & B,"We stayed here for 2 nights in Dublin.  Great value for price, as breakfast was included.  Breakfast was plentiful and varied.  All staff were extremely helpful.  Rooms were clean and guest-friendly.  Walking distance to transportation was very reasonable.",4,2017,01,10
233,A couple of days in Dublin,"The hotel is charming and the staff very friendly and helpful, including writing down instructions. The rooms were clean and very comfortable. The bath was large and plenty of hot water, but the showers were poor. It is possible that this will be part of the refurbishment which was starting after Christmas. The 'award winning' breakfasts were excellent.
Just a few minutes walk away is the overground railway station for Landsdowne Road which is only four stops from the centre of Dublin. The trains were frequent and cheap.",4,2017,01,01
233,Wonderful B&B!,"We stayed here for 2 nights upon arriving in Dublin. This is a flat out wonderful place! We were here during the Christmas holidays and their beautiful living room had a warm and inviting tree with tea/coffee and sweet treats always available. The staff is just terrific. We had an episode where on our first night we took a taxi back to Ariel house because it was raining and very dark. It's only a mile and a half between the city center and Ariel house. The driver moved in circles and intentionally put us in traffic to drive up the price. What should have been about 10 euro before any kind of tip ended up being 15. When we told Elyse at the front desk, she said that it's even happened to her. When we needed a taxi to go to the airport, she made sure we had an honest driver. The DART train is all you need to get back and forth between city center and Ariel house, which is what we did with the exception of that one taxi back to the hotel on our first night because we lost our sense of direction in the rain and darkness. And let's not forget their extraordinary breakfast! The continental breakfast offering is more than enough but then you just have to order one of their cooked to order breakfasts as well. Their traditional Irish breakfast is fantastic as well as their pancakes. It's all included in the price of your room. We had a very spacious room with a huge bathroom that had a massive sunken tub. Everything super clean. We would come back to Dublin just to stay in Ariel House.",5,2016,12,30
233,"Beautiful place to stay, would love to come back","This is an older place obviously, which is what I wanted as I wanted a place with charm. I do agree with some reviews about minor details like maintenance, I had a lovely room with a rather odd bathroom that was a bit narrow and there was one creaky spot in my room (which was on the second floor), but aside from that, the service and experience was fantastic. The restaurant staff were friendly, the food was probably some of the best breakfast meals I've ever had anywhere, the clerk staff were also incredibly friendly, approachable, and sincere. Everything else about the place was beautiful. Was always offered tea and r & r time in the elegant waiting area, was given great restaurant recommendations for local places and other great places to visit, had questions answered, etc.  I had mixed feelings about Dublin itself as I was only in Ireland for five nights for the Placebo concert, but I would certainly stay in Ariel House again the next time I visit Ireland, although I wouldn't stay in Dublin for long. Thanks to everyone at Ariel House, it was an absolute delight!",5,2016,12,28
233,Just like home - maybe better,"I read the prior reviews before booking Ariel House and, yes, it is a bit away from downtown Dublin but the staff are such a delight and the tea and breakfast were fabulous.  I would not recommend for a family but for a couple looking to relax and reconnect or a woman travelling alone, it's the perfect venue.  The staff get to know you quickly so you feel welcomed.  Management has a keen eye on what's going on and everything is handled efficiently behind the scenes.",5,2016,12,19
233,Christmas shopping with friends ,"We chose to get a taxi ( thirty euros for the four of us) from the airport into the centre of Dublin as we had an early 0800 flight from Manchester, so we spent a few hours walking around the Temple Bar area and along the city centre shops and bars 
We arrived around two pm such a beautiful house, standing outside I could imagine Ariel House as a large family home in years gone by, especially at this time of year with Christmas decorations 
Our check in was very straightforward and we were given two rooms on the lower floor,  ours being spacious and elegant with two single beds easily pushed together plus spotless crisp white bedding.
A visit to one of the local bistros helped have a good night's sleep   however, after being advised to go for breakfast around 9.30,  which would be quite late for us,  we were unable to get a table for at least another twenty minutes which either would imply there aren't enough spaces per guest, a problem if you have a flight or event to attend. 
I would add the best feature would be the location and proximity to the stunning Aviva rugby ground and nearby train station ",5,2016,12,19
233,Overnight stay,"This place was recommend by a friend of mine. I wasn't disappointed it's really a very good Little hotel near the Aviva stadium. 
Made welcome at reception, given a room upgrade. Rooms are well appointed for a B&B hotel. TV is a little small but that's not important. Bed clean and comfortable.
Breakfast was Barry good and service very attentive.
Yes I will stay again, and in preference to some of the larger corporate chain hotels.",5,2016,12,15
233,Afternoon Tea,We had a wonderful experience here with afternoon tea. I have would (and have) happily recommend it. Service was excellent and the food was everything that you would hope for. We will definitely return.,5,2016,12,09
233,Very nice place,A Very nice greathouse. The Staff and atmosphere are very friendly. My Room was very tidy and warm. The Food is delicious. My Only complaint was the broken shower in my room which had no hot water. Other than that it was a really nice experience,4,2016,11,29
233,Friendly staff but... didn't go back,Friendly staff but not really our cup of tea - beds small and shower in the bath is a nightmare unless you are a contortionist. Breakfast was ok but nothing special. We had booked a night on our way into Ireland and another on our way home but cancelled the second night. I think you can do better for your money - sorry to be blunt.,3,2016,11,29
233,Great stay with free parking.,"Stayed for two nights. 

Room: The room was a good size with extremely high Victorian ceilings. The bed was very comfortable. The floor tiles in the doorway of the bathroom were completely cracked/broken and moved when stood on. To me there were dangerous and could hurt your foot (easily fixable).

Staff: Extremely friendly and helpful.

Parking: I booked through booking.com where it says parking is free “reservation is needed”. We were arriving late so we picked this hotel as we believed we could reserve a space, this however was not possible and they actually have a first come first serve policy (something that is written in the “fine print” which we did not see). However we did manage to get a space easily anyway.

Stadium: The hotel is right next to the stadium, so when events are on the hotel road is closed. The hotel was great in emailing us to give information and tell us about the closure beforehand. If you are arriving by car it might be worth checking what is going on in the stadium. 

Breakfast: Was extremely nice with lots of variety and is cooked to order.

Afternoon Tea: The hotels gives free complimentary afternoon tea in the drawing room to guests. A lovely touch and the scones were amazing.

Location: It was a little bit of a walk into the city centre but the area is very pretty and felt safe.

Overall: Excellent, very beautiful, would love to return.",4,2016,11,29
233,"Very friendly, great location and very comfortable.","Recently stayed here on a business trip to Dublin, all staff always very helpful, from the very first minute, really nice drawing room out in front to relax in, breakfast excellent, beds very comfortable. Small car park out front. Would definitely stay again.",4,2016,11,28
233,7 star stay at 4 star price,"You're welcomed with genuine warm,kind, and caring staff. Elisa is an absolute dream, Luiz and Eoin are happy to help. Breakfast is fantastic, plenty to choose from and can't say enough of the cleanliness. If you're looking for an experience and sample the Irish welcome, this is the place to be!",5,2016,11,25
233,Amazing,"Genuinely cannot fault my stay!

Was looked after by a gentleman called Luiz, he was so welcoming and helpful, made the stay so great! 

Got an upgrade on arrival ( it was a sunday)

Breakfast was fab 

Literally no fault!

Enjoy it guys",5,2016,11,23
233,Beautiful B&B in Dublin,"My husband and I travelled with our best friends to Ireland in Nov. We wanted a place to stay in Dublin since we were flying out early the next morning. Upon reading reviews on Trip Advisor, I knew we couldn't pass up The Ariel House!

It proved to be worth its ratings! The staff were so helpful, and accommodating. The rooms were picture perfect. Our bathroom was HUGE (room 239). 

The staff gave great recommendations on where to go, and how early to leave. They offer coffee and tea whenever they see you, and do whatever they can to make your stay better.

The breakfast was delicious. Book your stay before they fill up!",5,2016,11,22
233,Great place with welcoming staff and fantastic breakfasts,"The location was great, about 25 - 30 minute walk to town or the train is about 100 yards down the road.  The staff was very welcoming, we needed to leave early on our last day for the airport and they offered to serve breakfast outside of their normal times to accomodate our schedule",5,2016,11,18
233,Wonderful stay,"I would recommend Ariel House to anyone ... The rooms were cozy, clean, and the bathroom was enormous. Quiet at night time. Friendly staff. Breakfast was FANTASTIC! During our stay I was four months pregnant so food was important! The food was high quality and fresh AND look exactly like the photos ... Yummy!
Note - Ariel House is not located in city center and in an area of town that I would say is less touristy ... exactly what my husband and I wanted! It is very close to the train station which can drop you off city center quickly. I would not let this deter you from staying at Ariel House, but it is worth mentioning so you don't have a surprise.",5,2016,11,16
233,Wonderful Hospitality,"We arrived on an overnight flight from the US and were desperate for a good breakfast and a little nap.  The Ariel House greeted us warmly, provided an outstanding breakfast and worked to get our family of 5 into a room as quickly as possible to get a little rest before we started exploring Dublin.  The rooms were roomy,  the linens clean and the showers were great.  They were able to arrange for adjacent rooms for us and the kids. The staff was extremely service oriented, outstanding people.  They have coffee and tea available in the sitting room as well as complimentary wine upon request.  There is parking available on site for free and they are located convenient to a rail station that was 2 or 3 stops to the heart of Dublin.  I would recommend a stay if you are in Dublin.",5,2016,11,15
233,Excellent.,"Excellent location next to Aviva Stadium. Staff very welcoming and helpful.Large,comfy sitting room with tea,coffee,iced water and selection of cake and biscuits always available. A beautiful and atmospheric house. Very comfortable ensuite bed room and a delicious breakfast. A perfect stay and even got a parking space. We are planning a return visit to see another Ireland rugby match!",5,2016,11,14
233,Wonderful place to stay,"Want to feel safe? Stay here, it's a beautiful neighborhood, within walking distance of a few sites and restaurants. 

The concierge's were amazing....we felt so comfortable asking them for assistance. Breakfast was wonderful...just about anything you want to eat they have. 

Only two things I would advise....there are steep stairs up to the entrance. A hotel gues and the concierge both helped us with dragging our suitcases up. Good thing because mine was heavy. 

Another thing is room 221 had a tricky lock. The concierge came up and helped me unlock my room once. The other time I stood there moving the lock back and forth until it finally clicked. Plus that room was over the entrance, so if you like to sleep with the windows open, it may get a bit noisy. 

The room was huge and the bathroom was absolutely perfectly placed. 

I didn't stay at any other placed in Dublin but I would go back here first, rather than take a chance at another place. 

It's worth every penny.....book it.",5,2016,11,13
233,Lovely place to stay and in a great location,"We picked Ariel House because the the reviews and location - and weren't disappointed. The taxi driver as we came in from the airport gave it a big wrap and also provided the names of good pubs in the area (Paddy Cullens & The French Paradox) and some travel tips - take the train to Howth for a trip out of town.
Checking in was a breeze and very welcoming. Our room was large, and the breakfast was excellent. The property has character and is in a good neighbourhood, which is pleasant to walk around. The train station is only a couple of minutes walk, which made it easy to get into the city and other places. It was only a 10 minute walk to the Hertz depot to pick up our car. There is a laundry service just up the road that does wash, dry and fold.
All in all, a great place to stay and would recommend it to others",5,2016,11,12
233,"Beautiful, comfortable and welcoming hotel in Dublin","My family and friends stayed at Ariel House this past summer. This house is absolutely beautiful.  Located in a central location, close to metro line and in a lovely suburban neighborhood.  We arrived in Dublin by ferry and needed to get to Ariel house by taxi. I would recommend trying to arrange a taxi ahead of time as our wait time was substantial.  

Once we arrived however, the staff were so friendly and inviting that we quickly forgot about the wait time at the port. The staff at Ariel house are knowledgeable, helpful and genuinely happy to see you. The front parlor had delicious treats and yummy beverages. Our triple room was luxurious and well appointed. The beds were super comfortable and plush. The bathroom was clean and neat. Our room was downstairs and was very quiet. The neighborhood is quiet too. This hotel was worth the splurge. 

Breakfast the next day was wonderful. The wait staff were attentive and kind. The food was delicious!  We were given great directions by the staff for our self guided tour of Dublin. And when it came time to leave after our 2 night stay, the staff arranged to have taxis pick up our group of 8 to take us to the airport. 

Overall, this was a fantastic place to stay for your visit to Dublin. We would definitely come here again!",5,2016,11,10
233,Fantastic Staff,"What makes Ariel House exceptional is the care provided by staff.  Everyone we met went above and beyond to ensure our stay was perfect.  Our room was lovely and the bathroom was like a spa, with soaking run and towel heater.  Breakfast included buffet items and made to order dishes, and sufficed for brunch for us. Tea cakes were on offer throughout the evening, and staff popped in frequently to offer a fresh cup of tea.  When we left, there was an issue, as the street was blocked for people leaving the match at Aviva Stadium.  The staff ordered a cab and spoke with the police to verify the best way to leave.  We received advice on where to go and how to proceed, which made the situation much less stressful.  I highly recommend.",5,2016,11,09
233,Excellent Stay,"I would recommend Ariel House, in particular the staff are fantastic.
As an example, i was finding it difficult to adjust to a different totime zone, so started working @ 1.30am. By 3.30am it felt like time for breakfast, so I went downstairs to concierge the person on duty brought to my room a freshly brewed filter coffee. Must say their filter coffee is quite nice and that one was very gratefully received. The staff at breakfast were just as good. Very friendly and helpful.",5,2016,11,06
233,"Beautiful property, excellent location","My husband and I stayed here for two nights and we loved everything about it. Spend the extra money to stay in the James Joyce Suite!! It is definitely worth it. The location for us was fantastic!!. You can walk into Dublin from here; however we decided to take the dart in because we knew we would be walking all over the city. It was so easy to do, and anyone at the front desk can explain to you how to get there and how to use it. The breakfast was fantastic!! Anything you asked for you got, with a smile and it's my pleasure. The only thing that was a little bit of a disappointment was that it seemed that certain guests were able to reserve the tables alongside the window. Had we known this was something that was able to be done, my husband and I would have taken advantage of this as well. The ladies in the breakfast room were fantastic, and work very hard to accommodate everyone. I can't really see where you would want to stay anywhere else when visiting Dublin. The Ballsbridge area is an elegant and very upscale area to stay and was perfect for us. There are many excellent choices for dining, all within walking distance, and we had our best meal in Ireland at The Old Spot, and that's saying a lot because we ate very well during our 10 day stay. For a casual fine dining experience, Roly's bistro is also not to be missed. Overall, we loved staying here and when we return this is exactly where we will stay again.",5,2016,11,06
233,Highly recommend ,"I stayed for one night in a twin room with my daughter and was very impressed. The staff were lovely, the beds are really comfortable and the breakfast was fantastic. There is a lovely drawing room available to guests where complimentary tea, coffee and delicious cakes and scones are available. Staff came in regularly to tidy, replenish supplies and check whether we wanted more tea. Only negatives I would mention are the temperature in the drawing room and bedroom. It was way too hot. The bedroom and bathroom windows were open when we arrived so someone obviously recognised this and attempted to remedy. The other drawback is the lack of decent restaurants in the area. Not a huge problem as we ate in town and got the dart back, which stops 100m or so away. ",5,2016,11,06
233,The perfect stay! ,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights at the end of October for a long weekend. 
We chose the Ariel house based on its brilliant reviews & I cannot express enough how right the reviews are!

We loved it. As soon as we arrived in the evening the gentleman that greeted us was so friendly & helpful, I don't think I've ever had such welcoming customer service. We arrived around 8pm & he recommended restaurants close by as we didn't fancy travelling into the city that night. There was a lot of choice and a couple of convenience stores open til 11pm. He even offered me his phone charger overnight as I forgot mine & couldn't buy one the next day! 

The building itself was so sweet, it was Halloween so there were pumpkins everywhere! The drawing room had complimentary cake & coffee in the afternoons/evenings which is a lovely touch after a long day of walking & sightseeing. 

Our room was a junior suite & so spacious. It was clean, comfortable & I loved the antique vibe. 
The breakfast is a must! Definitely have breakfast here, you won't get anything nearly as tasty or good value for money in the city. 

Great location, it's outside of the hustle & bustle of the city, in a nice area of Dublin. There is the DART train station almost opposite, you can get into the city from here in about 5 -10mins for 2.20€ - get a ticket to Tara street! It took us a while to work that out as there aren't any signs/maps. I think it is possible to walk too, much we walked so much during the days it was easier on our feet to get the train! If you have internet access, check train times first, sometimes we had to 20-25 mins for a train (this was on Sundays though or late at night). 

It was honestly the perfect stay. I would 100% recommend Ariel House to all my family and friends and we will definitely be staying here again in the future! Thank you everyone that made our stay delightful :) ",5,2016,11,05
233,Fantastic!,"This place was so great!  Excellent staff, excellent breakfast, beautiful rooms, great neighborhood!  This was the very best place we stayed throughout our visit to the UK and Ireland.  You will not be dissapointed.  Staff treats guests like royalty, close to City Center, but a great neighborhood with good restaurants and bars just a walk away.",5,2016,11,02
233,Lovely Victorian B&B,"I stayed at Ariel house for 2 nights as I was running the Dublin marathon on the Sunday and it was a beautiful old fashioned hotel with lovely staff especially the new receptionist who had only been working there for a month. Located by Lansdowne road dart station and about a 20 minute walk to Merrion square. My only faults were the tiny 14"" tv in the room which is unusual nowadays and the creaky floorboards from the room above. I was on the bottom floor and I could every movement above me. Breakfast was great and they even put on an early breakfast for the marathon runners.",4,2016,10,31
233,Great location and friendly staff,"We spent 4 nights at the Ariel House and it was our first time in Dublin. The location was great, it's on the same street as Dart and it's more of a residential area. The staff was friendly and great. The hotel is more of an old charm not so modern. 

Suggestions for improvement get new toilet paper, the ones in the bathroom are rough and horrible. I would bring my own blow dryer the one in the bathroom does not do much. There are also no shower robes.

The best part of our stay other than the location was the breakfast. The warm served breakfast was excellent and the staff was also very friendly.",5,2016,10,29
233,Wonderful just outside of city hotel,"Beautiful, smart looking and feeling 'boutique' hotel in Dublin, just down the road from the Aviva Stadium.  Very professional staff, a business person's delight I'm certain, although we visited as a couple on holiday.  Wonderful near gourmet level breakfast (I'm NOT a gourmet) but I liked the full Irish best, and even it was served with nice flair.  We had some wifi problems in our 'garden' level room which was far from the main entry, but the staff assured me it was an isolated incident.  Decent amount of available parking, and close by to train for quick travel to city center, otherwise a cheap cab or 10-15min walk.  Try using one of the hop on/hop off busses which you can grab near the Aviva.",5,2016,10,27
233,Ladies night out,What an excellent facility. Wonderful experience. A real old Dublin feeling right beside all services. Breakfast was wonderful and the service was excellent. I felt really special and cared for.Will be back,5,2016,10,27
233,Excellent all the way,"I stayed here recently (Sat 22nd Oct 2016) with my sister as we were attending an event near by in the RDS. We shared a beautiful twin room and it was very comfy and well presented. We had a wonderful afternoon tea in the sun room shortly after we arrived, we were spoiled for choice as each selection on offer was way too tempting and taste fab. After shopping in town we relaxed in the drawing room with a glass of wine, there was also plenty of coffee and treats available in the drawing room for self service, tasty treats too I might add. Breakfast was wonderful with lots on offer from a wide range of cereals, juices, a wide selection of in house baked breads, a nice selection of fresh summer berries, and lots lots more, the choice was excellent. Cooked breakfast was cooked to order and served on hot plates, quality ingredients used in all areas. Staff in all area's from reception, waitresses, kitchen etc are very attentive, mannerly and very professional. This B&B get's booked out very fast so I would advise you to book well in advance, you wont be disappointed!! Very reasonably priced. This establishment is a must do for your bucket list, top notch all the way as they ticked all the boxes and more. Cant wait to go back again.",5,2016,10,26
233,"No kidding, best breakfast ever","Loved our spacious room. Excellent service. Nice location, near a tram to go into downtown Dublin. Has parking. The best part was the breakfast. Seriously, amazing breakfast included with your stay. Wish we could have stayed longer! Highly recommend.",5,2016,10,26
233,Homey and convenient,"Excellent Staff, lovely room and bath  guest house  within a, blocks walk of the train station and a fees blocks walk off restaurants and shops! We enjoyed teas and cakes, morning, noon and night as well as a lovely breakfast! :-) ",5,2016,10,26
233,Overnight Stay,The photos on the website do not represent the actual rooms. Our room needed updating. The wifi service was unpredictable. The single beds in one of the rooms we used was smaller than a twin and you could not turn over without the danger of falling out of bed.,2,2016,10,26
233,Ireland gem,Stayed here 2 nights. Staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. Rooms were nice and clean.  The breakfast was very good.  Is in a quiet and nice neighborhood.  It is not very close to downtown so would need to use public transportation.,5,2016,10,24
233,Impeccable service and breakfast,"The rooms are not only lovely and tidy, but the service here is impeccable. Rarely have I experienced such a genuine and hospitable staff. The afternoon cake and tea is lovely and the breakfast is almost worth the price of admission. ",5,2016,10,23
233,Superb,"Absolutely first class. They met us at the door and carried our luggage to the room and it never quit. Heated towel bars, beautiful,rooms, excellent breakfast, helpful staff - it couldn't have been any better. We walked to restaurants for dinner, the Hop on, hop off was a 6 minute walk and the train was a 5 minute walk. If you are going to Dublin, stay here.",5,2016,10,22
233,"Good value, great location, fantastic service","The welcome is warm and the hotel is stylish and clean. Our room,259, was a generous size although a bedside light would have made it even better. The hair dryer attached to the wall in the bathroom is inadequate but reception very quickly provided an alternative. The staff are helpful and charming and the breakfast is superb. I did not like the coffee- I am very fussy- but the women on the next table complimented the waiter on its strength and flavour! I had to find a cafe in Ballsbridge to get my fix...
There is no evening food but there are fine restaurants within walking distance- we tried The Old Spot - excellent. Blooms - very good food and service and The Chop House- a tad more expensive but also very good. Tea in the lounge everyday is a nice touch. We would stay again.",4,2016,10,21
233,Absolutely marvelous stay!,"It's difficult to say enough good things about the Ariel House and its staff. The building is a wonderful adaptation of three classic townhouses. Each room is spacious and tastefully decorated with very comfortable furnishings, and kept clean and well-supplied. The 24-hour reception service also acted as ""concierge,"" helping us with various arrangements in the city during our stay. The breakfasts - astounding! The location was away from the noise and commotion of central Dublin, but very handy to a rail station which whisked us to convenient locations quickly and smoothly. We would definitely stay there again during another visit to Dublin.",5,2016,10,21
233,"Reviews are accurate - superb staff, comfortable lodgings on a quiet street","This was our first stop in Dublin for one night. We had room 230 which is on the main floor and just passed the conservatory where breakfast is served. I was amazed at how quiet our room was and would recommend it for a good sleep.  Our room was a standard twin (2 beds).    This was not one of the large rooms referenced but suited our needs. We had a large picture window with a view of the back yard that we enjoyed.

We flew in to Dublin on a red eye and had  planned to drop our bags and go explore. Frankly, we were exhausted and felt like zombies.  We asked if they could accommodate us early that we could get a few hours of sleep (fully expecting to be charged of course). We were offered breakfast and in the amount of time it took to eat our room was ready. To be able to sleep for a few hours and take a hot shower made all the difference. It was such a great feeling climbing into the bed with crisp clean sheets.  I would recommend considering  booking arrangements for anyone coming in from the US. We found this made our entire first day in Dublin wonderful.

The level of service at this B&B was outstanding. It was coordinated and across the board. The people employed here were GENIUNELY interested in helping make your trip enjoyable.  It came from their heart and that is the difference.

These lodgings were charming, historical, and comfortable.  While (if you look) some work could be done on maintaining the decor, these things also added to the charm. 

We enjoy walking. We found the Ariel House to be very convenient to a 15-20 minute walk into the city center.  We felt it was a safe walk and enjoyed the transition from noise and activity to quiet residential street.  We also loved dinner at the Chop House which was very close.",5,2016,10,19
233,Only place to stay in Dublin,"We stayed in Ariel House for three nights in October 2016. We stayed in a small room which was just perfect for us...clean, cozy and warm. This is the second time we have visited this hotel and wouldn't think of staying anywhere else in Dublin. The place is conveniently located near the Dart Line with only two stops to the centre of town. The nieghbourhood of the hotel is attractive and quiet and is close to good restaurants and cafes. As many past reviews have mentioned, the breakfasts are wonderful and delicious. But it is the staff that really makes this place special. Everyone we met was 
warm, friendly and helpful. We would have no hesitation in recommending this lovely hotel.",5,2016,10,18
233,Generous and gracious,"Our room, number 250 was very pleasant, cozy and comfortable. We found the location excellent with the Dart close by and walking to,the National Concert Hall about 30 minutes. The breakfast room is full of light and the food itself delicious. All the staff were helpful and friendly. We would definitely M recommend staying here.",5,2016,10,17
233,Very pleasant.,"We were upgraded to a 4 poster bed 😃
Good location with parking (slightly cramped), helpful staff, excellent breakfast. The local transit system, DART, station just 200m away with trains to the city centre, or walk just 25 mins to Grafton St.
Very close to the rugby stadium.",5,2016,10,16
233,Short break to Dublin,"We had chosen this guest house based on brilliant reviews and convenience to the city centre. It certainly didn't disappoint. We were warmly welcomed and treated like honoured guests throughout our 24 hours stay.  The bedroom with king sized brass bed was comfortable and welcoming. The drawing room complete with baby grand piano and coffee and tea on tap and complimentary newspapers was a great place to withdraw to. The breakfast in the conservatory was a real treat. 
We will certainly be back....maybe for an Ireland match sometime as the Aviva is a short walk! 
Thanks to Alisha, Anna, Cecilia and the rest!",5,2016,10,16
233,Hotel of choice for Dublin,"I've stayed at Ariel House a few times and it's a beautiful, elegant hotel in a lovely neighbourhood in Dublin. Staff are wonderful and are so accommodating. The hotel is a few minutes from a Dart station, has free parking, will make a take-away breakfast for early departures. Proximity to East Link bridge makes for easy access to Dublin airport. I love the feel of this place and it's my number one choice for visits to Dublin. ",5,2016,10,15
233,Great Location.,"The staff at Ariel House are very polite and helpful.  The breakfast is great and the location is a 20 minute walk to Trinity College (or bus stop is a block away).  Lots of restaurant choices within a 5 minute walk and a small grocery.  I recommend getting a suite.  The suites are very large with beautiful details, 4 poster canopy beds, and nice baths.  The standard rooms are much smaller and feel like a regular hotel room.  Furnishings are Victorian and although a little worn - have a wonderful period feel to them.  We stayed here twice and were very happy.",4,2016,10,13
233,Great hotel,"We stayed here overnight on our way back from Italy to the US. It's a lovely hotel, we had a very nice room, plenty of space. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and they serve a fantastic breakfast. Enjoyed tea and cake in the drawing room when we arrived. Spent the evening at a local pub, followed by dinner a great local restaurant. Definitely staying here again when we come back to Dublin.",5,2016,10,12
233,Quiet and Friendly,Nice comfortable rooms with everything you need.  Parking in front of the hotel is very difficult the car park is very small.  There is alternative parking next door: it would be helpful if this was made clear when one books.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  We were loaned umbrellas to prevent us getting soaked on the walk to the nearest restaurants. Being away from the busy city centre we all got a good night's sleep.,4,2016,10,11
233,Perfect accommodation for a perfect holiday,"We just came back from a perfect holiday in Dublin and this is in part thanks to the team at Ariel House. The building is stunning, the rooms are comfortable and clean, the staff extremely friendly and the breakfast delicious. We loved the drawing room - we were a group of 4 and this room was the perfect spot to chat in the evening while planning the following day's excursion and sipping a cup of tea. The location is also ideal - far from the hustle and bustle of Dublin city centre (and so very quiet) and yet very close to DART station. A very big thank you to all the staff for taking care of us and being always so efficient and cordial. Do not look for other accommodation in Dublin... just come here! :)",5,2016,10,10
233,Loved our stay!,"Loved it!  The rooms were a good size and comfortable, the food was excellent, and the highlight was the amazing staff-always available and always going the extra mile and more.  One example - I had only one pair of capris with me and spilled something on them.  Wanted to wear them again because we were having some warm weather.  The staff took them and washed and dried them for me at no charge, and did it with the attitude that they were so happy to be able to help.  I would stay there again in a heartbeat.",5,2016,10,10
233,Excellent Stay!,"My husband and I stayed for 4 nights in Oct. 2016. Ariel House represents Irish hospitality at its finest. The Victorian house gives an historic air that you just can't find at an average hotel, but the best thing about the Ariel House was the people. We felt welcome as soon as we walked in the door. We were exhausted after traveling all night, and even though we arrived early, they accommodated us quickly. Every employee treated us as if our comfort was of the utmost importance. Once the gentlemen who worked evenings knew our preferences, he would ask us if we needed something before we even mentioned it. For instance, we requested ice. We didn't even have to mention it after the first time. If he saw us enter the drawing room, he would not only offer coffee and tea but ask us if we needed ice, too. We loved the cakes and cookies in the drawing room every afternoon. Not only were they delicious, but they were perfect for holding us over until we decided our dinner plans. The Ariel House was right next to Aviva Stadium and a quick walk to a DART station, where we could easily catch the train into Dublin. Several restaurants were in walking distance. I HIGHLY recommend it, and I would definitely stay here again if I were ever back in the area.",5,2016,10,10
233,Stunning!,"This B&B/Boutique Hotel is just wonderful.The rooms are of an outstanding quality, the breakfasts amazing and the staff most helpful. The location is within walking distance of downtown Dublin or the DART train station is a short walk away. There are a number of great restaurants and pubs within close walking distance. Highly recommended.",5,2016,10,08
233,Great spot,"Wonderful location (close to DART station), quiet neighborhood, service extraordinary!, and clean / quiet room!
What else to ask - except to praise the delicious and filling breakfast / cake and coffee in sitting room!
Felt like we were visiting old friends rather than hotel space in big city!
Nice!",5,2016,10,07
233,A wonderful stay at Ariel House.,We spent 4 nights in this wonderful Inn. Our room was huge with separate sitting area overlooking the back garden. King size bed with a great mattress. Very quiet and peaceful. Location could not be better. 2 min walk to DART station and just a couple stops puts you into the heart of Dublin. Within a 5 min walk from the hotel is a little area of shops and restaurants. Breakfast was included and was just excellent. Could not have asked for anything more. Service in the hotel was fantastic. Every person that we encountered was so pleasant and helpful. The front sitting room is spacious and comfortable and we spent a fair bit of time sitting there reading the paper and drinking coffee that is always on. Little nibbles also provided of cakes and scones etc. Would come back to Ariel House for sure. It was just wonderful.,5,2016,10,06
233,Wonderful visit with fantastic service,"The Ariel House was a wonderful place to stay in a great location with excellent service, food, and rooms.  We arrived at roughly 5:30 a.m. due to an early flight, and even though the rooms were all full, the gentleman working at the front desk invited us to make ourselves comfortable in the sitting room, offered us the wi-fi code, and invited us into the dining room for breakfast and coffee when it was ready around 6:00 a.m.  The excellent service continued throughout.  In the rooms, some of the furniture is definitely older and worn, but it adds to the charm of the place overall.  I would highly recommend.",5,2016,10,05
233,Simply Brilliant !,"Highly recommended!  Great rooms. Fantastic breakfast.  Very friendly and helpful staff. 
Nice touch to have complimentary homemade cake and coffee in the lounge.  Good position for visiting Dublin. We walked in to the city each day .",5,2016,10,02
233,Great September Visit,We very much enjoyed our recent two-night stay at the Ariel House. The breakfasts and associated service were outstanding. We really liked the quiet location and the relatively easy walking distance into the center of Dublin. Front desk staff were friendly and very helpful during our stay. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.,5,2016,10,02
233,Fabulous,"The Ariel House was comfortable, lovely, and conveniently located.
However, the crown jewel in this hotel is the staff. We have done a significant amount of travel, and have never encountered a staff as professionally accommodating as the staff in this hotel.

The breakfasts in the mornings were prepared by a chef, served by the most delightful young people, and were unexpectedly wonderful. 

There was nothing we asked for that the staff didn't handle, and many times before we even had the chance to ask. If you're coming to Dublin, this is one of the best discoveries you'll find in the country.",5,2016,10,01
233,Lovely!,"We stayed here at the beginning of a trip to Ireland and London celebrating my daughter's birthday.  We  (daughter, me and 2 year old granddaughter) arrived mid-morning and the gracious staff served us tea while they quickly prepared our room.  The room was spacious and clean, furnished in antiques.  The gourmet breakfast was wonderful with an amazing variety.  This was the perfect place to begin a wonderful trip!  I hope to return.",5,2016,09,30
233,Very nice,We stayed three nights here. It was clean and coszy. The staff was very nice and super helpful. The room was a little small but it was clean and the bed was comfortable. A bit of a walk into Dublin's city center but it was a nice walk and the dart is also near. Breakfast was absolutely delicious and they had a great variety of dishes! We really enjoyed our stay. ,4,2016,09,29
233,nice place to stay,...my wife and I stayed here for 3 nights ...just steps from the train station- its very easy to get into the city ...but its also very walkable..we walked most of the time into the city  ....very clean ....very helpful staff..and a GREAT breakast..made to order ...,4,2016,09,28
233,Very nice spot!,"The people working were willing to bend over backwards to help anyone. They are a true find! Room was very nice work enquire shower, and breakfast was delicious. Great quaint, historic hotel for half the price of a generic hotel. We will come back!",4,2016,09,26
233,Best in Dublin,"The service, rooms and amenities are all top notch.  The breakfast was phenomenal.  The consistency and care with which every detail was handled was worth every penny.

The neighborhood is a brilliant counterpoint to Temple Bar and the regular tourist areas.

Our only regret was that we had booked on the weekend of this year's college football game without knowing it!",5,2016,09,26
233,favorite stay during our recent trip to Ireland,"We recently spent time traveling through Ireland and stayed at 5 different accommodations during our trip, and Ariel House was my absolute favorite.  Our room was very large, spotlessly clean, tastefully decorated, and well appointed with anything we might need including plenty of seating, storage, and even a towel warmer in the bathroom.  It had a separate bathtub and stand-up shower which was very convenient.  I cannot comment on breakfast because we had a very early flight and we had only had a quick, continental style breakfast.  I also love this area of Dublin.  It's a bit of a walk to the city center, but there are lots of restaurants and pubs very close by.  Ballsbridge is very lovely.  Parking is also included at a small car park in front of the building. Highly recommended and would love to stay here again.",5,2016,09,26
233,Great B&B in Dublin,"After a long flight from the U.S., we were pleased to arrive at the Ariel House and find such a comfortable and welcoming B&B. We really enjoyed our hearty breakfasts and thought our room was clean/comfortable. The bathroom was a bit small, but that is to be expected when traveling to Europe from the U.S. We also enjoyed the neighborhood the Ariel House is located in - very upscale/safe. This B&B is about a 20 minute walk to some of the major Dublin attractions & located right next to the stadium.",4,2016,09,26
233,Elegant charm ,Serene Elegance.... One of the best B&B's I've ever stayed at. Expansive bedroom & bathroom! Huge Victorian style buildings with rooms to match!! Perfect.....Loved the poster bed with drapes on it. Very tastefully decorated...with beautiful furnishings... Loved It!!!  Friendly & Courteous staff..well done!Breakfast buffet was delightful...Thank You,5,2016,09,25
233,"Wonderful hotel, excellent and friendly service","We arrived tired from traveling prior to check in. We dropped our luggage off and ventured out for a bite to eat. When we returned, our room was ready and we were notified that we had been upgraded. Our room was a junior suite and it was lovely. The hotel was quiet and conveniently located next to the DART train. In addition, breakfast was wonderful. Thanks for a lovely stay!",5,2016,09,25
233,A great base to tour Dublin ,"We chose Ariel House because of the good trip adviser reviews and as usual the reviewers were spot on
Its not 5 star but a very reliable hotel with great breakfasts and good room accomodation.A comfortable and warming atmosphere staffed by  individuals with a determination to make your particular stay as good as possible. Very close to bus and train to allow easy trips into Dublin or out to Malahide or down to Bray or Greystones.
Parking was easy for us and I would recommend you reserve a place.We had room 258 and it was quite spacious with 2 double beds a settee and chair and a nice bathroom.Dublin hotels are not cheap but at €150 it offered reasonable value.
",5,2016,09,25
233,Wonderful Cozy B and B,"Myself and my husband booked to stay here after not being able to get a room in our usual hotel. I was so impressed. Room was comfortable and pretty, staff were very helpful and friendly without being OTT or false like many places. Room was really quiet and I loved the drawing room with tea, coffee and cake whenever you fancy. Breakfast was beautiful. Will definitely make Ariel house my go to when staying in Dublin! ",5,2016,09,25
233,Kingly,"I chose this B&B from Trip Advisor and it was a great choice. I chose a junior suite and stayed in room 228. I HIGHLY recommend staying in this room. From the 12 foot high ceilings to the four post bed with canopy (we felt like a king and queen sleeping here) to the 10X12 foot bathroom, you will NOT be disappointed in your choice. Breakfast was excellent as my choice was scrambled eggs with bacon. We both really loved our stay here.  If in Dublin, this is the place!",5,2016,09,25
233,Excellent,"I checked into Ariel House with a friend for two nights prior to starting a long hike on the west coast of Ireland. As it was part of an arranged programme, the B&B was chosen for us as part of our trip.

It's in a fantastic location, only a 20-minute walk from Dublin city centre. The staff are superb - knowledgeable, friendly, attentive and nothing is too much trouble for them. Breakfast is simply amazing and absolutely delicious. There's a guest lounge where hot drinks and cakes (!) are put out in the evening for you to relax with.

This beautiful old Georgian lady has been lovingly refurbished and taken care of and is a comfortable little piece of luxury in Dublin.",5,2016,09,25
233,"Good place to stay, but not 4 star","We stayed at Ariel for 4 nights, and found it to be a good place to stay, just as many of the reviews state. It's well located, the included breakfast is of a high standard, the staff are really helpful and welcoming, there is free wifi, parking onsite and a nice communal lounge with fresh cakes and newspapers. What we had a bit of an issue with is the standard of the rooms, held out to be 4 star when the ones we saw were pretty ordinary. The rooms downstairs feel like they are below ground, although our friends had a 'garden view', it was also a bit claustrophobic and not well fitted out.  We asked to be moved and to staff's credit, this was accommodated. However, the new room was the same standard but overlooking the main street with traffic noise. Not that bad, but it's the little things that count, minor but important given the price range, eg. no tissues in bathroom, tiny pieces of soap (not replaced during stay), towels a bit thin, a fairly hard mattress, old furniture. As I say, minor things and not deal-breakers, just be aware that it's not really 4 star accommodation .",3,2016,09,24
233,"Excellent service, excellent food and accomodation","Ariel House is an excellent B&B. The staff are friendly, the food is excellent and the front desk staff are very helpful and efficient. On the first day I had a problem with the temperature of the shower and it was fixed promptly. On my last morning I had to leave before breakfast was served so they were kind enough to pack a breakfast to take with me.

It's located right beside the DART (train into Dublin), and is an easy 35 minute walk to the center of Dublin, and is an easy 10 minute walk from the Aircoach bus stop (to/from Dublin Airport).",5,2016,09,24
233,Perfect!,"Perfect location! Perfect, comfortable, clean and lovely room with modern bath. Perfectly helpful staff! Perfectly delicious breakfast! This was a great way to kick off our Ireland vacation. I highly recommend.",5,2016,09,22
233,Wonderful experience,"The beautiful house is close to transportation and walking distance to central Dublin City. Wonderful staff, very attentive. Always coffee, tea and pastries in the drawing room at any hour, awesome. Breakfast was wonderful and plentiful. The rooms are as if you are staying at a relatives home in the 19th century (with modern facilities). I loved stepping out and walking down the street to the Dart (train) taking me down the coast. My husband and I really enjoyed it.",5,2016,09,21
233,Pleasant Stay in Dublin,"My wife and I recently visited Dublin and choose Ariel House as our base of operations.It is located near the Landsdowne Dart station which made access to downtown easy and within walking distance of some great restaurants.The Hotel itself was nice with good rooms and good beds.The breakfast was great and overall service was very good,a real value overall.",4,2016,09,16
233,Outstanding Accommodations in Dublin (Ballbridge area),"We recently stayed 3 nights at this great B&B. Diedra, Owen, Anna, and the entire evening staff went well beyond to ensure our comfort. Clean, spacious and comfortable rooms; Relaxing and complimentary afternoon coffee, tea and cake served in a warm and comfortable room. Delicious, generous breakfasts served in light and airy outdoor-like setting. This is a very well managed B&B we highly recommend. Located 3 min walk from local train station to city center(2 stops away). Plenty of varied, very good restaurants in this quiet, comfortable neighborhood.  Onsite parking available and car rental facility 5 min walk away. Yes, 5 stars are well deserved. Thank you for making our stay in Dublin memorable. 
Tony & Darla.",5,2016,09,15
233,Impressive ,"My family and I visited Dublin August 25-27. It were extremely pleased with our stay at the Ariel house. Located in a quiet tree lined street 1 mile from the temple bar area.  Our beds were comfortable
Bathroom was very efficient.
We added the breakfast package that was amazing. Breads fruits cereals yogurt that all as a prelude to a menu that could appease anyone's hunger. Eggs poached fried scrambled country bacon potatoes pancakes French toast
All were delicious. The staff was amazing friendly making sure there was nothing you needed while making you feel welcomed. 
There is no other place we would stay when visiting Dublin.",5,2016,09,12
233,Welcoming!,"What a great place to stay in Dublin! Location is fantastic, 100 m from the Landsdowne DART (train) station.This made it very easy to get in and out of the central city (2 or 3 stops out). They have a lovely formal lounge at the front and offer coffee/tea and cake when you arrive or you can help yourself during the day. The breakfast room is bright and sunny and had the best breakfast we had in Ireland. The range and quality was outstanding. The room we had was very nice, the only problem being a loose connection with the tv which they tried to fix with masking tape. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,09,12
233,Lovely property in a nice part of Dublin,"We stayed 2 nights in a lively suite facing the street.  It was quiet and very comfortable.  The staff helped with any questions, arranged an early breakfast as we had an early flight.  Decent restaurants within walking distance.  Would stay again.",5,2016,09,12
233,Enjoyable Stay,"My wife and I spent (2) nights here while visiting Dublin. The ambiance and room decor was fantastic. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was fantastic (selection of buffet items plus cooked-to-order). Two things to be aware of; 1. parking is very limited and 2. no elevator, so if you have large bags you are luging them up/down the stairs.",4,2016,09,11
233,Amazing Choice to watch the GT vs BC american football game,"Our room was a gorgeous suite, the breakfast was delicious, the location perfect next door to Aviva stadium, great workout facilities and the charming courteous staff made our trip unforgettable even though Boston College lost.",5,2016,09,07
233,Very nice stay!,"This was our first stop on our trip in Ireland.  The hosts were very nice and helpful - we arrived when it was the hottest days they had in a decade and since the rooms do not have air conditioning they were able to provide us with a fan that allowed us to stay very comfortable (wish the windows opened up more to let more air in).  They provided us with a great map for us to be able to walk into the city of Dublin - you can take the train too but we walked the whole time - bring comfortable walking shoes!  The breakfast was very good in the morning, they make everything fresh to order.  Tea, Coffee and sweets out for afternoon/evening was a nice touch.  Would definitely stay here again!",5,2016,09,04
233,Dublin stay,this was a wonderful place and lovely location.  not far from the city center  quiet area.  great staff.  staff always helpful with ideas and planning and arranging taxis.  breakfasts were lovely.  plenty of food and choices.  good pastries fruit yogurt cheese etc on a self serve area as well as extensive menu.  plenty good meal to begin a full day of sightseeing.   very comfortable place. would highly recommend,5,2016,09,03
233,A great choice for the outskirts of Dublin,"We chose Ariel House due to its Tripadvisor rating and were pleased with our choice. If you have a car and so don't want to stay in the city centre this is a great location - it is 200m from a DART station (Lansdowne Road) giving you quick access to the city centre for 3.75 euro return. There is limited car parking on site, which is free but better for smaller cars! Ariel House is more a small hotel than a B&B, with several staff on duty who all seem to aim to provide guests with a good stay and great service.
On arrival (4pm) it was lovely to be offered (free) tea/ coffee and homemade cake in the very comfortable living room, where we browsed the hotel's recommendations for local restaurants, which turned out to be very helpful and accurate - we ate well at Roly's, some 300m from the hotel. 
Our room was on the lower ground floor at the rear overlooking an attractive garden. The room was compact, but clean and fully supplied, with a good shower. The wifi was fairly good. The only downside was that the bed squeaked as soon as it was touched, so we woke up whenever turning over in the night. However, when we mentioned this the next morning, the receptionist was horrified and so undoubtedly this problem will have been solved by now!
There was a fine choice for breakfast, with 'starters' comprising eg fresh fruit with yoghurt and honey prepared to order, as well as the freshly cooked Irish Breakfast. There were also plenty of other 'continental breakfast' options. Breakfast staff seemed busy at 8.30am, but all tables were taken and were cleared as soon as guests left and staff seemed to be happy to deal with individual special requests.
Definitely a good choice for just outside the city centre!",4,2016,09,03
233,Lovely house,"Situated in a very quiet zone, the Ariel House give you a familiar place were to stay if you visit Dublin. The rooms are ok and clean. Must try the Irish Breakfast, you will find a lot a good food to eat (can see in the picture what i mean). Overall a lovely place to stay if visit Dublin.",4,2016,09,03
233,Amazing,"Everyone was so kind and helpful. They really try to make you feel at home there. In the drawing room, they have sugar cookies, banana bread, petit fours, coffee, and fresh tea that you can sit there and drink or they offer to bring it to your room. Also, the breakfast is delicious. There is a buffet and a menu to choose from but whatever you pick, it will be great. You should definitely go here. I loved it!!

233,Old world charm ,"Really nice accommodation even though had just one night stay. Room was nice and large, good bed, shower working very well and same goes for wifi. Breakfast was nice as well and staff is really wonderful. If the weather is nice like we had, it's a nice walk from the B&B to the city centre. Overall a very good choice for your Dublin accommodation.",4,2016,09,02
233,A Real Unknown Gem,"Ariel House is a 37 room B&B that offers the services of a five star hotel with a first class breakfast which is an unusual combination of services for a B&B. My wife and I appreciated the personalized attention in a beautiful Dublin Victorian home. 
From the moment my wife and I walked into Ariel House we were impressed. When we arrived, the first offer by Deirdre, the manager, was to have tea and cakes in the parlor as our room was prepared and these treats are available all day. Within minutes our room was ready and the staff escorted us to our room. 
We spent 3 nights in this gorgeous Victorian hotel before leaving on a 7 day tour of Ireland and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were so friendly and helpful and it was so nice to be staying out of the city. We returned from the tour to stay an additional night prior to returning home. Upon arrival we found that we had, for some unknown reason, been upgraded to a suite. 
The entire staff is fantastic and helpful, especially the ladies in the dining room who were very pleasant and attentive.  

Stayed August 2016, traveled as a couple",5,2016,09,01
233,Elegance!,"This property is a left over from a bygone era when elegance and charm were more important than glass and chrome.  

Simply a beautiful property.

The staff are cheerful yet highly efficient and the morning breakfast is magnificent.

Set in the older southern section of Dublin where leafy lanes and grand properties abound.  A great guesthouse that will not disappoint.",4,2016,09,01
233,Enjoyable Stay,Lovely quiet area.  Close to IPA college so worked very well for me.  Near the town for dinner/drinks.  Great breakfast...didn't eat much till dinner :)  Staff are all very friendly. Great free wi-fi.  Was able to watch netflix on my laptop.,5,2016,08,29
233,Best B&B in Dublin,"Welcoming, friendly, superior service and I could go on and on. The staff was wonderful during our visit. From fresh tea and biscuits throughout the day to a wonderful breakfast each morning, Ariel House felt like our home in Dublin City.  

Superior rooms were large with quality beds and large private baths. Quiet streets and our handy sleep machine made for a restful evening. ",5,2016,08,28
233,Couldn't do enough for us,We spent 3 nights in this gorgeous Victorian hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were so friendly and helpful and it was so nice to be staying out of the city. Our room was warm and stuffy when we arrived so they gave us a fan which was brilliant and made it so much easier to sleep at night. The girls in the dining room were very pleasant and attentive as were the reception staff. An early start on our departure day meant we would miss breakfast so they had prepared a takeaway breakfast for us. We would highly recommend Ariel House to anyone wanting a special stay out of the bustle.,5,2016,08,27
233,Lovely period property,"We had three nights in Ariel House and enjoyed all of them. To start with, the room was a great size: more than enough room for two people and our suitcases. Nice, comfortable bed, a true queen size! Good size shower in the bathroom, no one ended up hitting elbows on shower screen! Fresh towels! That seems to be a luxury in Ireland and the U.K.! More than enough toiletries for the duration. Lovely breakfast and lovely afternoon tea in the lounge every afternoon! Parking was included and it was close enough for us to walk into Dublin everyday. Lots of places to eat around the area as well. Would most definitely stay again!",5,2016,08,27
233,"Very kind and friendly staff, but...","Despite the very positive attitude and support provided by the whole staff, my evaluation is not so enthusiastic based on several aspects:
- noise in the room: we were in room 234, below common spaces, therefore we had people walking on our heads the whole night;
- small breakfast room: long and unpredictable waiting time to have breakfast (in my opinion at least 2 more tables could easily be places in the breakfast rooms);
- even if we left our room at 9.30 hanging on the door ""room free for service"", when we came back at 15.30 the room had noy yet been cleaned;
- mistakes in the invoice: apparently the system had registered a booking for 3 nights, and therefore I have been initially charged for them. Fortunately I had a written confirmation that the booking was for 2 nights, and we could solve this problem",2,2016,08,26
233,"Kindness, warmth and comfort","We stayed 3 nights, all staff very helpful and friendly, especially the afternoon manager ( was it Shaun?).
Excellent breakfast, lovely rooms, complimentary tea and cakes in the afternoon, and very well located.
Thanks! Hope to visit again!",5,2016,08,24
233,Charming hotel with a great location,"First time staying out of the city center while in Dublin and it was a pleasure to be out of the city hustle for the evenings.  We stayed in a suite and found it clean and charming.  A little dated, but that added to the charm.  The staff was exceptional, the breakfast was delicious with wonderful service and the afternoon tea/cakes left in the parlor was a very nice addition to our stay.  It was very easy to get the DART-very short walk.  We enjoy walking and walked to town several days. It was not too far.  We enjoyed going down to the Schoolhouse Pub for evening nightcaps which also was a short walk. The beds were comfortable and we slept soundly in our quiet room on the second floor. Not a lot of bathroom toiletries, so be sure and pack your own, which we do anyway.  It was nice to have a bathtub in the room and the towels were fresh each day.  There is a hairdryer in the room and also a hot water kettle for instant coffee and tea.  Loved the ivy encircled windows and seeing the local people every morning walking past.  It gave us a feeling of what it would be like to live in such a lovely neighborhood.  We were packed a take away breakfast for our early morning departure which was truly appreciated.  Thank you, Ariel House, and we hope to return again.",4,2016,08,24
233,A welcome surprise,"After booking very last minute (practically on arrival around 6pm) we were pleasantly surprised. We were placed in a family room which was so spacious and beautifully furnished providing the old charm of the building. It was in very close proximity to the DART station which was a very short trip to the city centre but also very close walking distance to some great restaurants. The staff were great and breakfast was amazing (and I can tell you after travelling through a few b&b's it was well above the standard we had been provided in others). There was a sitting room with tea, coffee and cakes we didn't get to use due to our short stay. I also loved the history provided on the house in the guest book. I only wish we had stayed longer. A very comfortable stay.",4,2016,08,23
233,Ms. Lucy,"Just wow. It is probably 3km away from city centre...but the house is amazing! Rooms are ok. The receptionist is nice. And you can drink tea or coffee in nice salon. You can even try some homemade treats. And the best was breakfast. I totally enjoyed. You can choose from many and I had pancakes with crème fraîche, maple syrup and berries...It was so tasty and looks great. The Scones was perfect. And waitress so kind. The breakfast was 🔝🔝🔝! ",5,2016,08,22
233,Nice little boutique hotel,"Nice and clean hotel that is and old house that had been renovated in to a hotel. Good breakfast, Ez access into town from the hotel. Recommend. I would definitely stay here again. Good time of year to stay in late August",4,2016,08,21
233,Lovely boutique in high end location ,"Our driver described the location at D4 - The high end part of town.  Ariel is lovely, relaxing and very good service.  No air conditioning but probably not necessary. Heated towel rack in a tiny bathroom but what a joy to see a big bath tub in Europe! Large breakfast. The Staff is exceedingly kind and accommodating. Beds comfortable.  Truly wonderful place. ",5,2016,08,19
233,Best place we've stayed in Dublin,"Very well-located for arrvial by road (parking provided) and close to the DART station, and the Aviva Stadium, yet in a quiet residential area.
Our room and ensuite were both extremely spacious and clean. The staff were always friendly and helpful. Drinks and cake in the lounge were an unexpected bonus.
Breakfast menu is extensive and of good quality.
This was our third trip to Dublin and by far the best accommodation we've had - hotel standards at B & B prices.",5,2016,08,19
233,Could not be more accommodating! Highly recommend!,"I was visiting Dublin with my mom and my aunt and selected Ariel House because of all the great reviews on Trip Advisor. It was a little further out of town that the centrally located hotels but that was no problem at all. Even though my aunt and mom are in their 80s we were able to walk to where we got onto the hop-on-hop-off bus. It was about a 20 minute walk through lovely neighborhoods. I also used taxis and the Hailo app which is great! Also DART is very close but we choose to walk. The Ariel House has a lovely sitting room which we made use of on several occasions. They serve coffee, tea, water, and cakes there at varying times throughout the day. In the evening when we returned the staff always asked if we wanted anything. One night the staff person even gave me a pitcher of water to bring back to my room. Absolutely excellent staff!!! Breakfast was delicious. One morning we had an early bus trip and they packed up a breakfast for us to take. I was gluten free and they were even able to accommodate me. Room was clean and comfortable. Highly recommended! Will stay here again the next time I visit Dublin!",5,2016,08,18
233,"Location, location","The location of this gem couldn't be better. It's just a block or so to the DART and in a leafy, quiet residential neighbourhood filled with Dublin Georgians. The staff are very friendly and helpful and breakfast is very good. The rooms could do with a bit of updating and WiFi is patchy but otherwise it's very good value. We were there for five nights and very pleased with our stay.",4,2016,08,17
233,A Dublin place to stay,"that's a  wonderful hotel in dublin. Just a little bit southern than center, it's only 200m away from DART Station, but center is also reachable with a 20-25min walk.
Staff is fantastic and helpful, room large, really confortable and silent.
The breakfast is really fantastic with a wide choice in the buffet and in the menu, all included. They also offer afternoon tea or coffee with biscuits and cake in a relaxing living room.
Wi-fi perfect.
Highly recommended.",5,2016,08,16
233,Very accommoding and friendly,"The staff here are extremely helpful and polite, we were to early to check in but the lady at reception let us leave our luggage in a room until we could check in, which left us free to do all we had to do that day!!! I found this very helpful... we were also offered tea/coffee before we left which was very hospitable! The hotel is decorated beautifully with art and vintage/victorian furniture. Breakfast was included in our stay and was beautiful!! KUDOS TO ALL THE STAFF YOUR ALL SO KIND AND HELPFUL!!!!",5,2016,08,15
233,Could be great,Even though this B&B was not in the heart of Dublin it was easily accessible via Dart.  We reserved a STANDARD room which relegated us to the basement (request SUPERIOR room) - felt like we were in a dungeon.  Doors were very difficult to open.  Bed was the most uncomfortable bed I slept in during my 6 week travel.  Hair dryer didn't work.  Wardrobe doors did not stay closed and were a hazard at night in the dark.,3,2016,08,15
233,Excellent as advertised,"Stayed three nights and really enjoyed it.  Breakfast starts at 7:30, but you can get the buffet starting at 7, which we did on our last day.  DART is so close we took it everywhere.    Also we had a great room on the front of the main house facing the street yet quiet.  Ceiling must have been 14 ft high.  People were helpful and friendly.   Great place for a first time in Dublin.",5,2016,08,13
233,Wonderful welcome to Ireland,"We arrived at Ariel House in the morning after our flight from the US. The welcome we received was wonderful - we were offered coffee and pastries and a place to freshen up and leave our bags as the previous guests had not even had breakfast. We spent the day in Dublin - all walking distance - and came back to our bags in our rooms! The rooms were comfortable and the breakfast was perfect. This is a beautiful pace to stay in Dublin on a quiet, tree-lined street . A place to stay with all the modern amentities but in a beautifully decorated Victorian way.",5,2016,08,12
233,Very hospitable B&B,"We stayed at Ariel house for 2 nights at the start of our trip to Ireland.  A bit away from the town center, its location is nonetheless attractive in a quiet residential neighborhood.  Our room was spacious and comfortable.  Service was friendly and attentive and breakfast exceptional.  Keep in mind that this is an old house with the typical plumbing issues of old buildings.   Drainage in the bathtub was especially annoying as the water pooled around our legs while taking a shower.  Carpets and furniture are also showing signs of wear and tear and could benefit from a spruce-up.",4,2016,08,11
233,Nice accomodation,"Clean rooms, nice welcome tea, fresh and rich breakfast in a nice room with view on the internal garden, very gentle personnel. Internal parking included, Temple Bar zone 10' drive by car. Will come back if again in Dublin, not sure it's possible to find a so good solution for this money.",4,2016,08,10
233,Attention to detail with a smile,"From the moment my honey and I walked into Ariel House in Dublin we were impressed with their attention to detail. The first offer by Deirdre, the manager, was to have tea and cakes in the parlor as our room was prepared and the treats are available all day. Within minutes our room was ready and the staff escorted us to our George Bernard Shaw Junior suite #222. This oversized room had a king bed, couch, two comfy chairs, desk, armoire, a corner chair, and speedy included WiFi. The ensuite bathroom had a nice tub and shower combo.

Ariel House is a 37 room B&B that offers a first class custom breakfast and the services of a five star hotel which is an unusual combination of services for a B&B. My honey and I appreciated the personalized attention and the cozy feeling of being in an establishment that allowed us to have a relaxing night away from home in a beautiful Dublin Victorian home.",5,2016,08,05
233,Victorian splendour and modern convenience,"A warm welcome and superb service was apparent from the moment we walked into Ariel House. The room felt quite unique, it was spacious and quiet and very clean. The location was very convenient for the Dart station and Ariel House proved a suitable location for a pleasant walk into Dublin. The tea/coffee and cakes provided in the drawing room every afternoon were delicious as was the breakfast menu. The staff were really helpful and nothing was too much trouble.",5,2016,08,05
233,"Lovely building, lovely residential area near tram and tech office area","Minutes to walk to ballsbridge and other restaurants and academic and hilecher offices. A beautiful sumptuous breakfast buffet and gourmet hot breakfast courses. 3 Victorian Era townhouses combined, with great furnishings, some antique, paintings and modern conveniences. Lots of electrical outlets, good free WiFi. 50 feet to Lansdowne train and tram stop and 8 minute walk to Ballsbridge bus stop. ",5,2016,08,01
233,Fabulous (and honest) place to stay...,"My family and I stayed in Ariel House during this year's Dublin Horse Show. It is a fabulous place to stay in Dublin for many reasons, regardless of whether you like horses or not! Firstly, it's location - literally in the shadows of the Aviva Stadium, a short walk from the RDS and several steps from the Dart to take you anywhere you want in Dublin. Secondly, the accommodation is first rate - the rooms are beautiful and spacious. And finally, the staff are excellent. They are very attentive (especially during the substantial breakfast - so much choice!) but also very honest. We were unaware that we had left a sum of money in one of our rooms during our stay - this was handed in by housekeeping after we left, before the hotel contacted us and sent it back to us! Thank you so much! This sums up this wonderful place and I have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone visiting the Fair City...",5,2016,07,31
233,Lovely Georgian House,"This was my second time to stay in Aerial House and will probably stay again. Its located near the RDS and the breakfast they serve is second to none. The staff are very pleasant, the only thing that that I recommend is that you ask not to get on the lower floor as rooms in that part of the house are a little dark. Other than that I gladly recommend it.",4,2016,07,27
233,Truly gorgeous,"This was an excellent stay. We got a beautiful room (the James Joyce) with an amazing 4-poster bed and lots of space. The service and breakfast were all awesome. It's slightly more than a comfortable walk away from the main touristy area, but there are taxis and uber available. ",5,2016,07,26
233,Amazing place to stay,I absolutely loved my stay here. I will only stay in Ariel House now when visiting Dublin. The friendliest staff I have ever came across. The room was perfect. Very clean and bed so comfortable. Breakfast was hands down the best I have ever had. Amazing selection. I cannot wait to return again soon.,5,2016,07,25
233,Lovely Neighborhood,"We really enjoyed our stay. The room was large and comfortable, breakfast was delicious and tea time was relaxing. The best was the people! Everyone at the desk was so thoughtful and helpful. Our luggage was delayed and they were very accommodating.",4,2016,07,24
233,Wonderful B&B in a lovely part of Dublin,"This is a wonderful B&B in the Ballsbridge suburb of Dublin which is a lovely part of the city; a lot of the embassies are based here and the streets are lined with Victorian/ Georgian houses.

The B&B has very spacious and clean rooms and the hospitality is excellent.  Tea and cake was served on arrival and there were lovely little touches throughout our stay including Easter eggs on Easter Sunday during our stay.

The breakfast is the best I've had anywhere...superb selection that is freshly made in a wonderful conservatory setting.",5,2016,07,24
233,Perfect,"Spotless, large room, very comfortable bed, beautiful breakfast, all cooked fresh to order and very friendly and helpful staff. Located about 100m from Aviva stadium and 500m from RDS. 50m from Dart station. Will definitely stay here again",5,2016,07,23
233,Excellent Location away from the City Center,"A very pleasant neighbourhood. Our room was on the ground level, easy to access. The breakfast in the morning was the highlight with very aesthetic and tasty hot breakfast cooked to order.Very hospitable and helpful staff.",4,2016,07,23
233,Good customer service,"Stayed 2 nights in basic room. Plenty of space, eclectic old furniture added to charm, clean, Breakfast was good. They packed us breakfast before catching early flight - cheese sandwich and fruit which we should have dated before the US pre-check since we had to throw the fruit away.",5,2016,07,22
233,"Warm welcome, great location","Ariel House is in a great location with 3 good restaurants and a great bar within 5 minutes walking. Dublin city centre is about 15 minutes walk away. The staff at Ariel House are wonderful, very friendly and helpful, the breakfasts are amazing with lots to chose from. Our room was very comfortable, spotlessly clean. Free car parking and wifi. We've stopped in 4 star hotels that don't match up to this place. Hope to stop here again on our next visit to Dublin.",5,2016,07,22
233,Really Lovely,"Stayed here for just one night but have nothing but praise for Aeriel House. Lovely staff, nice room and a great choice at breakfast. Also free parking and wi-fi and great location. Highly recommended.",5,2016,07,21
233,"Good Location, Nice Breakfast, Okay Room","I understand there are different rooms in this B&B. Sadly, we must have had some of the ""not so nice rooms."" The furnishings were quite beat up, the bathroom sink wouldn't drain (and yes I told the front desk about it but nothing was done), and the room above us kept us up and woke us up both days we were there. The location however is convenient to utilize public transportation or walk to a variety of locations. The breakfast in the morning was quite good, as was the tea service in the the parlor. Overall the experience was ""ok,"" but not happy with the two rooms I had to pay for.",4,2016,07,19
233,Amazing and the most welcoming people ,"Had an amazing time in Dublin. Romantic weekend and hopefully more to come . 4 poster bed. It was my partners birthday and they gave him 2 bottles of compliment arty wine. Staff couldn't be any more accommodating. Great location. Will definitely be going back and staying there. 
Breakfast great. Free tea, coffee and cake. 
Very clean and well presented. Pictures do not do it justice. 

",5,2016,07,18
233,Jumping off point for Irish exploration,"We were on a family vacation (6 of us) and the hotel could not have been more pleasant! We had a load of luggage from our red eye from the states and they helped with storing while we explored Dublin for the day until our rooms were ready. The front desk personnel were some of the most helpful I have ever encountered in a hotel, arranging for taxis, advice etc. Breakfast was fresh and fabulous and rooms were spacious. Wifi was strong and easy access. One our our family got to experience afternoon tea and loved it! Would definitely return there again!",5,2016,07,18
233,Quiet and friendly,"Nice, quiet, friendly place with a good location. It's about 15 min (15-20 euros) from the port by cab, about 25 min to the airport (25 euros) and you can walk to the center of Dublin in about 30 min. Very safe area with some good restaurants within a 10 min walk. The room was nice, nothing special. Had a window that opened but could use some more ventilation during July. Breakfast was really nice and a real treat.",5,2016,07,17
233,Cute and full of character,"A stay at Ariel House is a must if in Dublin. It's very near to the arena and within walking distance of many good restaurants. This B and B has an unbelievable breakfast that is served daily in their brightly lit sunroom. The rooms are older and full of antiques that give it a lot of character. Biscuits, tea and coffee are always served in the drawing room and the bathrooms have bathtubs. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here!",5,2016,07,13
233,"Nice location, great staff and wonderful breakfast","We had a nice quiet and clean room. Wonderful staff and breakfast. Tea was available in the afternoon with treats.  We enjoyed the neighborhood pubs, resaurantants and being a 30 min. walk from the major tourist areas.  The only issue we had was that our bed was a ""double"" size. It seemed a bit small for two people.",5,2016,07,11
233,Worth the money!,"We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of our tour of Ireland. Ariel House is a very clean & comfortable B&B that's a short stroll to the train line & 10-15 mins walk to lots of restaurants & pubs. They serve a very good breakfast, with lots to choose from.",5,2016,07,10
233,Quiet and relaxing,"We stayed in the Ariel House for nights while in Dublin.  For starters, the people working here were exceptional.  The guy at the front desk even walked down the street to hail a taxi for us!  At first we were disappointed that the hotel was so far away from most of the tourist attractions we were hoping to see.  (10ish minutes in a taxi)  But by the end, we were happy to have a hotel in a quiet neighborhood to return to at the end of the day.  Breakfasts were delicious!",5,2016,07,06
233,Good Value,"Stayed here 3 nights. The good, excellent breakfasts, very helpful staff, nice neighborhood location. The not so good would include,  distance to the city center a 30 minute walk, rooms are dated and things like bath towels not 4 star quality.",5,2016,07,06
233,Beautiful accommodation in a lovely area,"We stayed at Ariel House for 3 nights and thoroughly enjoyed the accommodation and the food.  We had a superior double room and there was ample space with a sitting area and a very large bed more like a king size bed. The breakfasts were fantastic, with so much variety of foods to choose from and the staff were excellent.  It was a great part of the day to have breakfast in the conservatory with the delicious food served.  It was about a 40 minute stroll to Grafton Street shops.  There is a train about a 3 minute walk from Ariel House as well. A few pubs less than a 10 minute walk away for dinner, we liked The Chophouse, a little bit more expensive but a great setting and great service.  Parking was also available at the front of Ariel House off the road which was perfect and 24 hour reception.",5,2016,07,05
233,Nice stay,This was a nice stay for one night. Our room was enormous and breakfast was really nice. I also appreciated the free parking. I do wish it was a little closer to some of the city's main attractions as we had to walk pretty far and take a cab.,4,2016,07,05
233,Felt right at home!,"From the moment you step in the doors, these lovely hotel employees ALL make you feel as if you were part of their family. We were instantly greeted with so much care and attention! They knew we had had a long flight and attended to us to make sure we would instantly feel better. Their breakfast is out of this world and their rooms are comfortable and VERY quiet! It is set in such a lovely area that make it all the more enjoyable. You are close to the city center but far enough that the hustle and bustle scene is not a bother throughout your time at the hotel. I would HIGHLY recommend staying here!",5,2016,07,05
233,"Fabulous brunch/quiet, elegant location","Compared to the cramped, overpriced place I stayed Galway, Ariel House was an absolute delight.  Very reasonably priced, amazing breakfast, and a very large and spacious room.  
The staff were very helpful and I also found the location to be quite charming - a quiet suburb of Dublin, but within walking distance of downtown.  My only small quibble was that my room had a bit of a musty odor, no doubt because it was located on the ground floor. Also the place is not very handicapped accessible, due to the plethora of stairs. But it may be possible to get a room on the main floor for those who have more trouble with stairs. Favorite touches - the sunny breakfast room and the lovely cakes at tea time. I would definitely go back there, if given the chance.",5,2016,07,04
233,Top Class Guest House,"Ariel house is an upmarket quest house. It is a Georgian style house. The facilities are  top quality as is the breakfast. You will have a few stairs to negotiate but it is well worth it. The staff are most helpful with your luggage. Tip, ask for guest room on Lansdowne road upstairs as they are the best. Reception staff are also most helpful with bookings you require or advice. Overall just a great experience.",5,2016,07,03
233,a gracious and helpful staff,We arrived at the Ariel house at 6:00 am after flying all night. The staff stored our luggage for the day and offered us breakfast. The meal was good. The room was very large and clean. We were very happy with our stay here.,5,2016,07,02
233,Great hotel - highly recommended,"We stayed at Ariel House for two nights. We received a warm welcome from the staff and were offered refreshments whilst we waited for housekeeping to ensure our room was in order. We were upgraded to a suite for having booked via the hotel website.  The rooms were charming, clean, spacious and well equipped. The breakfast was lovely and the staff super friendly. The hotel is a very short walk from the centre of Dublin (took us 20 minutes). We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and can see why it is #2 hotel in Dublin. We would highly recommend it to anyone who wants an affordable stay at an excellent hotel. Thank you to the staff for a wonderful stay.",5,2016,07,02
233,Lived up to expectations,"Excellent two night stay. Very welcoming friendly staff, clean and tidy room, very comfortable queen sized bed, small bathroom but functional. 
Breakfast is amazing! Efficient service from staff and enough food to almost get us through to dinner. 
20-25 minute walk to city centre or train station very close by. 
Definitely recommend this place to friends and would stay again. ",5,2016,07,02
233,Great stay,"I'm long overdue for this review! My stay was fantastic! The location was a little bit far from everything, but it's worth it. All of the staff were friendly, and the breakfast was delicious. My room was decent sized, and was quiet. I would definitely stay here again!",5,2016,07,01
233,Perfect Stay,"We chose Ariel House based on some previous reviews and can say they were not wrong. While I wanted to give it 5 stars there are parts of the venue that are in need of a bit of updating. Specifically the drawing room where the furniture should be replace. That is my only off comment. We arrived early and Cecilia was very helpful when our room was not quite ready, she sent us down for breakfast and by the time we were done the room was ready. I had requested an upper floor room and we were put in 220 in the main house. it was very comfortable with a nice bed and bath facilities. The shower was strong and had plenty of hot water. The morning breakfast was very satisfying with multiple choices on the menu as well as a light buffet. In the afternoon they had tea and coffee and some small cakes available in the drawing room. The staff in the dining room was super, very attentive and friendly. The front desk staff was always available to recommend a dinner spot or provide any information. Transportation from Ariel House to City Center was also very convenient. While the front would call a taxi if needed my wife and I found the DART, just up the street to be excellent. For Euro 7.95 you got a round trip ticket for 2 to either Pearse or Tara stations. Easily the way to go. There are a few nice restaurants within walking distance and the area is very residential and safe. Would stay there again without issue.",4,2016,07,01
233,Amazing! ,"We loved this hotel! We arrived in Dublin, and had nowhere to stay - our first two choices were booked, so as a last resort we booked Ariel House. Once we arrived, I was SO HAPPY that the other two were booked. This hotel is amazing! Everything was perfect and the staff was so nice. The breakfast was glorious, and we ordered pancakes off the menu. We stayed at a different hotel every night, and even the castle we stayed in wasn't better than Ariel House. ",5,2016,06,29
233,Enh,"Visually:
It was not as nice as the photos. While the furniture was antique, it didn't feel super clean or well maintained. It was kind of like staying at your grandma's place. Yes, she has gorgeous antique furniture, but I kind of wanted to take a steam cleaner to everything and replace the springs in the couches and chairs. Also, the hall lights are fluorescent, so it added a weird quasi institutional feel.

Functionally:
There's no a/c, so I had to open the windows to get air, but the street isn't super quiet, so it kept me up. The bathroom was clean, but the sink didn't drain very well. The door is tricky because the lock is odd and the handle quite small and round, so at one point I thought I might be trapped in the bedroom. The tv is small and weird, and kind of crappy quality.

Hospitality:
It was actually a bit standoffish... Which is odd because the rest of the country is culturally SUPER friendly and chatty. I regretted not staying in a b&b, because while the Ariel House looks like a grande home, it feels like it's staffed by people who aren't personally invested in the establishment. 

Food:
The breakfast was AMAZING. I have to say, it was one of the top meals I had during my week in Ireland. There was a huge variety, and great quality. They really went all out on the food. It was not only delicious, but it looked impressive too. If I were rating this place based on my breakfast experience alone, I'd give it five stars.

233,Lovely B&B on outskirts of Dublin,"We stayed 2 nights at Ariel House, the room was charming and had all the amenities-- shower worked great and so did air conditioning. This hotel is about a 25 minute walk into the city center- if that is not your style, note that the cabs are pricey. It cost 30 euro from the airport to the hotel, and about 10 Euro from the hotel to city center. Breakfast was fantastic! Staff very helpful and accommodating- I would stay there again!",5,2016,06,28
233,Boutique Hotel,"This hotel offered delicious breakfasts in a darling morning room. The room was
Adequate with a nice view of the front street, but the decor was tired and boring. The
Bathroom was ok, and robes plus slippers were provided.
We walked to the City Center, although it was a long walk for sure. The rates are
Reasonable, and the front staff was young and a bit average in dealing with guests.",4,2016,06,26
233,Great hotel!,The Ariel House is in a good location about 20 minutes walk from the city center and right next to the dart train.  Their breakfast was fabulous and service excellent! Staff were very helpful and nice. The room was also very nice.  We will be staying there again!,5,2016,06,24
233,What A Great Find,"Stayed a few wks ago for a group birthday celebration and wow what a find. 
Our room was large & had all the amenities we required, however is was at the front of the house & with the busy road outside it was noisy for a light sleeper. However, the building was wonderful with beautiful furnishings & the breakfasts are wonderful......never had such a great quality & selection of food, congratulations to all the people working there you made it wonderful stay. And lets not forget the option of tea-coffee and home made cakes at times during the day-evening. The Hotel may be a bit out of the city but with the train & bus service so close it wasn't a problem & taxi's weren't that expensive if required. Book early to get a booking!",4,2016,06,23
233,"Great service, but average hotel","We stayed at Ariel House for 1 night before flying back to the US. The service was great! Our luggage was brought to our rooms. We were able to print out our boarding passes. They stored my food in their kitchen for me, did rush laundry service, and scheduled a taxi to take us to the airport. The staff wwas really wonderful.

We were not very impressed with the actual hotel though. It did have Victorian charm, but our room and bathroom were small. The room felt very dark. The water in the shower never warmed up. We were also very warm in the room. When we opened the window, we could hear the train going by. Perhaps it was just the location of our room (257). 

On another note, wifi was super fast! There were some good restaurants, a market and Starbucks about a 5 minute walk away. Aviva stadium was a 2 minute walk away.",3,2016,06,19
233,Great hospitality and room,"Lovely people a fabulous room, very clean hotel. Would definitely recommend a visit! Especially if you book the James Joyce room which has a four poster bed. Not to be missed. Great if you want to be out of the busy city and have a quieter stay in Dublin",5,2016,06,17
233,Great place to stay!,"We stayed at the Ariel House for 3 nights with 2 nieces.  The staff at every level went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable, especially Cecilia and Dierdre.  They even organized a surprise birthday cake at my husband's request, and it was one of the nicest cakes I have ever had.  The breakfasts were top notch with a broad selection to choose from and the dining room staff were excellent.  The location was  convenient and it is in a very nice neighborhood with a couple of very good restaurants within a 5 minute walk.  We had an early flight so they even packed a brown bag breakfast for the ride to the airport.",5,2016,06,16
233,Great hotel with awesome breakfast!,"We stayed for 3 nights in a standard double room. The room was a good size for two people and very clean. The staff was extremely helpful, even when we were delayed in arriving until midnight. Perhaps the best part of our stay was the delicious breakfast every morning! The hotel is also located with easy access to the DART station and city buses for getting to the city center.",5,2016,06,13
233,Comfortable attractive hotel located close to public transport within easy striking distance of the city,"Ariel House is situated about 25 minutes walk or less than ten minutes by train from Dublin city centre.  It's perfectly located for the AVIVA stadium and for the RDS.  The hotel staff are helpful, the breakfast excellent with plenty of choice, the room a comfortable size and well appointed.  Unlike some other places this trip we did not feel confined to a small space. There is plenty of eating and drinking within a five minute walk.",5,2016,06,10
233,Terrific in every way!,"This hotel is an outstanding choice for your Dublin stay.  The staff is excellent, friendly and vey helpful!  The location is absolutely perfect - close to great restaurants, an easy walk to down town yet on a quiet and beautiful street.  VERY reasonable and terrific value.  Would definitely stay here again when visiting Dublin!",5,2016,06,07
233,Location is great!,"We stayed at the Ariel House for 2 nights recently. They were VERY helpful in every way, from letting us know we would be welcome to check in at any time, to helping my husband figure out the ""M50 tolls"" and also calling ahead to our next destination to make sure we had time to stop along the way. All very much appreciated!!

The breakfast was incredibly delicious, diverse and served wonderful service!! We couldn't stop talking about it.

We arrived and parked the car for the duration of our stay. The location is perfect to take the DART to seaside locations or into Dublin although we walked to and from Dublin which was an easy pleasant walk.

I can't give 5 stars and I feel bad about it because the rooms were sort small and dark because we were in the basement?? Ireland was in the midst of a heat wave and the rooms were stuffy with no air flow, luckily they provided us with floor fans but I would have liked a better room as seen in the pictures!

We would definitely stay at Ariel B&B again, but would ask to be placed on higher floors.",4,2016,06,07
233,The Best!,"We stayed at Ariel House in 2007, and when we traveled to Dublin again last month we decided to stay there again. We arrived in Dublin at 8:30 am, took a bus to Ballsbridge, and walked to Ariel House. We didn't expect our room to be ready and were just going to ask them to store our luggage, but we were told that the room would be ready in a half an hour. Also they were upgrading us to the William Butler Yeats room. The room was big with a four-poster bed, a bay window looking out on the road in front, and a bathroom with a huge tub. 
We were invited to have tea or coffee and breakfast. We decided to take them up on their offer while we were waiting. The nice thing about the breakfast is there is a selection of rolls, breads, cereals, fruit, and juices, but you can also order from the menu. I had scrambled eggs with smoked salmon which was great. One morning I had pancakes which were delicious and so beautifully presented with a real flower on top that I had to take a photo of it.
We like that The DART is down the street, and you can buy a ticket and be in the city centre in a few minutes. Ariel House is on a residential street and is quiet. The stadium is down the road next to The DART station, so I assume it would be quite noisy on game days.
I highly recommend Ariel House.",5,2016,06,06
233,"Lovely, comfortable hotel with the best breakfast in Ireland.","This hotel is really a great choice for travelers who want a comfortable, quiet and well-kept lodging without spending a fortune. My wife and I stayed two nights on the first leg of our Ireland trip and really enjoyed it.  The hotel is on a quite section of Dublin, lined with what I suspect were once stately homes.  Now it is primarily lodgings.  Ariel House is actually a combination of at least two large houses, that are connected to each other.  One warning, there is no elevator and the reception is one floor up from the street.  When we arrived, however, our bags were whisked from us by an able young man and were brought to our room. Reception was very attentive and found a room for us despite the fact that we were earlier than check-in time.   The room was spacious, clean and comfortable.  The bed was very comfortable.  The hotel is very close to the Dart train, which runs into the center of Dublin quite frequently.  We are walkers and walked into the main tourist areas from the hotel, which took 30 minutes.  On the train, it would be 10 minutes.  Probably the most wonderful aspect of this hotel is the fabulous breakfast.  It is served in a dining room that has a glassed in room which overlooks the garden.  Several options are available to order.  Our favorites were the vegetarian Irish breakfast (really!) and the smoked salmon and poached eggs.  They also served a full Irish breakfast and had an table set with all sorts of healthy cereals, fruits and yogurt.  In total, it was an excellent experience.  One small issue that prevents me from giving 5 stars was that our non-smoking room was on the same hallway with smoking rooms.  So one suggestion is to make one hallway all non-smoking.",4,2016,06,06
233,Nice place to beggin our Ireland Journey,"The staff start to finish of our 3 day stay were friendly, helpful and quite responsive to anything we needed.  The Ariel is in a classy old building and it was very nice to come home and have hot tea and snacks at any time in the drawing room.  Breakfasts were outstanding--the selections, the quality of the food and the preparation.  The furniture in the room we had and the common area was a little dated and worn but this was a minor issue.  Easy to catch the DART train downtown and the station was only a half block walk.  A very nice place to begin our Ireland trip!",4,2016,06,06
233,We love this hotel!,"We picked the Ariel House for its location about a block from our son's home.  It turned out to be a perfect pick for lots of other reasons.  I had a number of questions before I arrived, and the email responses were immediate.  Once we arrived, the staff continued to be attentive, considerate and helpful.  Example:  One morning my 8-year-old grandson showed up; a place was set for him at breakfast with no questions asked and no charge.  So nice.  Breakfast is excellent.  The lounge is large and comfortable -- a great place for an after-dinner drink to keep the evening going.  The decorations are a little the worse for wear, but not in any ways that detract from the totally warm experience of this little hotel.",5,2016,06,05
233,Loved this quiet spot in a great location,"We usually always stay in hotels but we needed to be based outside the city centre this trip so we decided to try Ariel House as I'd heard good things about it. We LOVED it, great welcome , really lovely room looking into a leafy quiet street and we had a sensational breakfast the next morning, the breakfast buffet is full of surprises ( marmalade cake , lots of great fruit, perfect strong coffee ) very efficient, friendly service. Great location for Aviva stadium , lovely restaurants & bars nearby & an ideal base for touring , we'll be back!!",5,2016,06,02
233,Loved it,"Myself and wife stayed here for 2 nights after finding it high up on trip advisor. Yes it's not centrally located but is in a lovely quiet area and is seconds from the dart station which is then a 5 minute ride to the centre of Dublin. You can also walk it in around 30 minutes or get the hop on hop off bus Cityscape luxury sightseeing, outside the ballsbridge hotel for €10 for the day. 

The hotel is lovely, well kept and clean. Breakfast excellent and they offer tea and biscuits in the lounge during the day. We had a junior suite which was large and comfortable. Little warm at night in the warmer months and found other room doors slammed so disturbed our sleep on the first night, but didn't notice the second night. Furniture missing a few handles so could do with being addressed. 

All in all a fab stay and would highly recommend and would stay here again. All staff we encountered were very friendly and happy to help. ",5,2016,06,02
233,great stay ,"The breakfasts are fabulous , great buffet selection to start then a choice for main . Free fresh Coffee and home made cakes served all day in the lounge. Close to the Dart train link to take you all around the Dublin area and some good local restaurants to choose from in nearby Ballsbridge . ",5,2016,05,31
233,"Great location, hotel and service!","Stayed at Ariel house for a few days which was a perfect end to a terrific vacation.   The ""tea room"" and lobby inside the hotel are beautiful and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.   Everyone was always going out of there way to ensure you were taken care of at all times.   The room was comfortable and spacious, including a comfortable bed.  The location is 2 minutes from a DART station which will take you to the city center.  The hotel is also within walking distance of some good restaurants (and a Starbucks.)   And the breakfast - can't say enough!   Everything was delicious - from the traditional Irish breakfast, pancakes, eggs, amazing yogurt, granola... it was all great!   You can't go wrong staying here!",5,2016,05,30
233,Good Hotel In Dublin,I stayed here for 3 days in Sept. 2015. Its a nice hotel in the embassy neighborhood on Dublin. The breakfasts are very good & the rooms are quiet so I was able to get a good nights sleep. Its easy to take the train or a taxi to the down town area. The pub area of Dublin is very noisy with many 20 & 30 somethings partying & getting totally hammered.,5,2016,05,29
233,Relaxing in Dublin,"Thanks to the staff at the hotel for a very relaxing stay and the breakfast set us up for the rest of the day. The room was spacious and very comfortable, the bathroom was of a very high standard and very clean.
Couldn't recommend them highly enough.",5,2016,05,29
233,Great stay,"Amazing place that made for a great stay in Dublin.  Dart station a 2 minute walk that gets you to middle of town in 2 stops.  Plenty of great places to eat just a short walk away.  Deluxe double was so big it felt like an apartment.  Staff was amazingly friendly and helpful.  Served tea, coffee, biscuits and cake when we arrived early and waited for rooms.  Can't wait to go back.",5,2016,05,28
233,Excellent Way To End Our Honeymoon,"My wife and I stayed in a Junior Suite at the Ariel House. The room was very large and furnished beautifully in a Victorian theme. Our room was clean, and comfortable. The Ariel house has a nice parlor where guest can relax with a complimentary scone and cup of tea at mid-day each day. For breakfast, they have an excellent fresh continental selection to add to their made-to-order menu. This one one of the best places we stayed in Ireland, and would recommend it to anyone else traveling to the Dublin area. It's a 15 minute walk from Dublin city centre, which is excellent, but you don't need to walk that far to get great food. There is a great selection of food, beer and drinks around the corner from the Ariel house.",5,2016,05,27
233,Really wish we had hot water,"The good:  The staff is lovely.   The breakfast is nice.   The neighborhood is pretty, though not in the city centre.

The bad:  No hot water in the shower 2 of the 3 days.   As it was only 50 degrees out, this was not ideal.  We complained the first day and it was fixed the second, but broken again the third.   When we went down to the desk to complain, nobody was there.   Put a damper on the stay -- no pun intended.",3,2016,05,26
233,Very Accommodating,What a beautiful place! The staff were wonderful and very helpful! It was a very comfortable place to stayI would highly recommend it. Donna and Kevin from Boston! Also I almost forgot we had early mornings going off in the morning before breakfast started so they got us some breakfast which was delicious!,5,2016,05,26
233,Great first night in Ireland,"We had a great stay at Ariel House on the first night of our vacation in Ireland.  The location is great, the breakfast was wonderful, but the highlight is truly the staff.  They went out of their way to make us feel welcome.  Deidre even helped arrange a small surprise for my wife as we were away from home on Mother's Day. I so appreciate the effort to help their guests feel at home and highly recommend a stay at Ariel House.",5,2016,05,24
233,Amazing stay,The staff is amazing. They go above and beyond. Breakfast is wonderfull. Would definitly go again. Although not in the city centre the location is perfect. The dart is just around the corner. And with a few stops youre in the city centre.,5,2016,05,24
233,Incredible food and location!,"This was a short walk to the center of Dublin and had a an amazing breakfast.  I would book a trip back to Ireland, just for this place.  I had remembered this place from long ago and so happy we went back, can't wait to return!",5,2016,05,21
233,"Best of Hotel, Best of B&B - Combined","We chose Ariel House based on reviews here.  Our experience was so incredibly positive that we're paying it forward for the rest of you lucky enough to be traveling to Ireland.

Our arrival was late afternoon, so we popped in to drop our bags off and head to dinner before we collapsed.  We were welcomed warmly and taken to our room- I cannot remember the room name (sorry!) but it was the one directly under the breakfast room.  We couldn't believe the room size (huge!), beautiful full wall of windows with garden views, and the modern large bathroom (with enormous jetted tub).  So- first impression was wonderful. 

We stayed here for two nights and had only positive experiences.  The breakfast room is beyond charming, and the breakfast itself is the best we had in our 2 weeks traveling in Ireland.  Incredible breakfast.  

Hotel quality of rooms, amenities, facilities and food were all excellent.
B&B quality of warmth, assistance, personal touches and also food- all excellent.

A couple of examples of the warmth:
When we came back exhausted from dinner after a day of touring the city and wanted a cup of tea, we headed in to the room where tea and cookies were always waiting.  The man at the front (apologize- cannot recall his name right now) offered to bring the tea to our room for us so we wouldn't have to wait to go to our room nor have to juggle carrying it.  Just so nice and above and beyond to notice our debate about how to manage.

Deidre helped us check out when we were ready to leave.  She asked about our travel plans.  She then wrote down - for almost every town we planned to visit- best places to eat and who she knew at the restaurants/who to ask for, best site seeing, fun pubs.  We traveled around with her list in our hand (figuratively...we took a photo of it so it was always in hand and not misplaced) and were not disappointed once.  And once in each town her recommendations almost always lined up with what the locals we ran in to recommended as well.  She also made sure we had proper directions to the next destination and helped us decide, once we gave her a sense of what we liked most in general, what to see and what to skip along the way.  She was a personal trip planner, off of the cuff, and just so kind and warm.

I cannot recommend this B&B/Hotel highly enough.  I will return to Ireland again (hopefully soon!) and would not stay anywhere else in Dublin.  

Happy Travels!",5,2016,05,20
233,Relaxing first night in Ireland,"The staff at Ariel House really went out of their way to welcome us - including helping us cart some heavy luggage up their front steps. The tea, coffee, and little pastries they put out in the front room were absolutely delicious and just what we needed to recover after a long plane ride. The room was beautiful and the view to the front courtyard was lovely! The best part of the stay was definitely breakfast though. The dining room itself is very attractive with windows to the back garden. The serving staff were so friendly. The food - I had french toast brioche - is not to be missed. ",5,2016,05,20
233,A warm welcome awaits!,"This is a gem of a hotel - Deidre and her friendly team do all they can to make sure guests are comfortable, well looked after and have the information they need to get the most out of a visit to the Dublin area. The tea/coffee and cakes in the sitting room are a much appreciated touch and the well-publicised breakfasts do live up to expectations! The hotel's proximity to the DART station makes it both accessible for Dublin and the coast - really convenient for those who want to explore the surrounding area. Thanks for an enjoyable stay!",5,2016,05,19
233,Delightful!,"We spent 4 nights in the George Bernard Shaw Room in this delightful hotel.  Room had comfy king bed and huge sitting area, lots of windows, nice bath.  Staff throughout were wonderful and breakfasts were fantastic.  Lovely tea with delicious goodies every afternoon in communal living room.  Close to several restaurants in Ballsbridge area - easily walkable - recommend Roly's especially.  Highly recommend this charming hotel.",5,2016,05,18
233,Wonderful staff!,"Ariel House is a reasonably priced hotel in Dublin, quiet, in the best part of town. It's a bit of a walk to the major sights, but doable, and taxis are inexpensive. The Air Coach from the airport delivers and picks up just 2 blocks from it for about 8.50 Euros, which is very convenient. The walk to Merrion Square is pleasant on streets lined with cherry trees. Breakfasts were very good and filling, and the staff served tea and coffee with delicious cake and cookies every afternoon, welcome after a long day of sightseeing. Without exception, every person who worked the desk was pleasant, helpful, warm, and friendly. The only drawback was no elevator. I would also advise any readers who go to either take a book light or a device that is back-lit, since the lights in the room are dim at night.",4,2016,05,16
233,Lovely place to stay,Booked Ariel house at short notice for a business trip. Lovely old house with huge bedrooms. 3 times the size of a hotel room in most hotels. It is a lovely guest house with attentive staff. breakfast was excellent and great choice. A little crowded at 8.00 am and had to wait a little. There is no restaurant so went out for dinner. Places to eat around 7 mins walk away. Revert regent rooms. Would stay again. ,4,2016,05,16
233,"Musty, creaky, dark","We arrived late and this was our last night in Dublin so it was a bit inconvenient for packing up because of the stairs to the entrance, and the stairs to the room. The parking was not abundant and very narrow. The room was so dark, colors and lighting. The place was worse for wear... and at immediate entry of the room, it smelled thick of an old man's musty cologne. The charm of an old victorian home was lost on the styling/colors and just being a bit run down. It's in need of an interior decorator, a good deep clean and steam, and a lift. Breakfast was fine. Staff was fine, but not personable.",3,2016,05,12
233,Wonderfull visit,"We stayed in Ariel house for 4nights and it was one of the best stays ever.

The personal is incredibly friendly and helpfull and the breakfasts are unbelievable.

When arriving we had very good and more than plentifull high tea (thank you Anna, you we a joy) and I have to confess that we took advantage of their afternoon cakes anf scones every day.

If it hadn't been such a lovely neighbourhood to walk and so conviniently close to the city center, i doubt we would have left our lovely room 251.

Some really good restaurants and nice pubs within 5to 10minutes walking distance AND the trains from the station go to some costal villages as well, not bad to visit Howth and pay only 6.15e for a return ticket!

Will return and praise!",5,2016,05,07
233,This place is brilliant......!!!!,"After a while out of the city we came to stay in Dublin for a few days - I had picked Ariel from TA reviews - we were hoping it would be good - it surpassed our expectation on all measures.  The room was perfect - all facilities you could ask for in a room at this price point.  Good afternoon teas and a top notch breakfast to start the day!!  Beds wide and very comfortable.  Bathroom well appointed and with the option of bath or shower - compact, but perfectly functional.  Our bedroom had a sitting area too - great to relax in and read.
The staff are the hotel's greatest asset - they are friendly, incredibly helpful with suggesting places to visit or go for evening meals within walking distance. The short distance to the DART makes the location perfect and we didn't hear any train noise either!!!  Unlike many city centre hotels, this one has parking for patrons - for us a great advantage.  We will certainly return to stay here when we next come to Dublin.  Very highly recommended - but just leave space for our next visit please???!!!!!",5,2016,05,06
233,B&B for rugby-unbeatable ,"Stayed here for rugby international in the Aviva stadium.

Lovely converted townhouse(s).
Tight but priceless off street parking available - handy to know at the start that this is not just in front of main door but adjacent property also which is linked internally.

Rooms were spacious and very clean.
Staff friendly and very helpful -as evident when we inquired as regards a handy local eatery,this was quickly not only recommended but booked for us.

Breakfast was fabulous - one of the very best I've experienced in a B&B.

Complementary fresh tea and coffee plus biscuits/cakes available all day in the drawing room-nice touch.

The obvious winner with Ariel House is its proximity to the Aviva stadium,you are just minutes from your stadium seat.
But less obvious is that it's even closer to the DART stop,thereby making staying here a realistic prospect even if you're planning your time around city centre .

233,"for the discerning foodie traveller; 'boutique' hotel, inclusive of award winning breakfasts","when visiting a city for more than a few days, i prefer to become more local...ariel house is the ticket; a short jaunt to city centre by metro situated literally at the end of the block, or an easy picturesque stroll through rows of victorian homes to the hub...quiet! mature tree lined street, astounding! breakfasts, large! rooms, comfortable! beds, drawing room with non-stop in house! baked goods and coffee/tea, spot on! staff/deirdre ;).......this is exactly the 'home away from home' i/you seek when in a bustling city...trust me...(i stayed in april 2015, though i am positive the property is as it was being under deirdre's watch ;)...",5,2016,05,04
233,excellent base in Dublin,"A very good option for staying in Dublin. It's a bit off center (30 min. walking distance, absolutely safe and quiet area) but next to the train station if you are in a hurry. Converted old mansion, with nice restoration details. Magnificent breakfast (opt for the salmon option). Friendly service. Nice clean rooms. In house parking. Great comfortable lounge to have a cup of tee or coffee.",5,2016,05,03
233,Beautiful,"A haven of tranquility right in the center of a fashionable part of Dublin, everything superb, a warm welcome, complimentary coffee, cake and scones upon arrival, beautiful rooms, ours had a four poster bed, I don't know if that is normal with all rooms or just with ours, very nice bathroom the only minor complain was there was no moisturizer, and a fabulous breakfast. Thank You!",5,2016,04,29
233,Nice Stay,"The room felt very clean, and was a good deal for the price. We arrived fairly late, and the staff was accommodating and very friendly. We also had breakfast which was a fairly good deal. There is a little bit of parking in front of the hotel which is also a plus. We would stay here again!",4,2016,04,28
233,lovely place,"I am really appreciated of the kind support of all staff. Thank you very much for Warm welcome and hospitality of my stay here. 
The room and atmosphere was nice and breakfast as well as welcome desserts are really superb. Lovely dinning room with the garden view was just perfect.
Special thanks for support on my lost laptop which was left on the airport coach. The manager and staff followed it up until I got my treasure back. It will be one of the most memorable traveling experience of my life :)",5,2016,04,27
233,Charming.. Ideal place for quick visit to Dublin,"Stayed here for one night recently for a quick trip to the Abbey Theatre. Because I was in Dublin just one night I didn't want to spend a fortune but the prices I was finding were pretty steep (Dublin is not a cheap city). Ariel House was about the least expensive, well-reviewed hotel I could find. Though not situated in the city centre, getting to and from Ariel House couldn't be easier. There is a bus from the airport that goes out to Ballsbridge, stopping at the Ballsbridge Hotel. Ariel House is a short walk away. A few minutes from the house is the Lansdowne Rd train station that you can use to get in and out to the city centre. However, Ballsbridge is probably the loveliest residential area in Dublin, with wide streets lined with elegant Georgian houses. So walking from here is just a delight. There are also restaurants, cafes and bars in the local area (try The French Paradox for llunch or dinner).
The house itself is a couple of Georgian houses joined together with an extension at the back. It is comfortable, rather than luxurious, and full of charm. The rooms are on the basic side, but more than adequate. My pillows were hard and the radiator hissed but not a big gripe. The staff were extremely helpful; I was offered tea and a scone on arrival. Breakfast was fantastic with a huge selection, including porridge and pancakes. Really excellent. Will be more than happy to stay here again.",4,2016,04,27
233,"Good service, average rooms","Ariel House was nice enough, the rooms were nothing special but clean and comfortable. The whole place had a feel that I was staying at grandma's house - cosy and old. The pipes and floors were a bit loud and could make difficult for some to sleep, I ws a bit jet-lagged and had no trouble.

The tea and desserts are a great bonus, the staff is super friendly and didn't charge me for breakfast. The service is great, which I suppose is why it has such a high rating.",4,2016,04,26
233,Perfect choice!,"We loved this hotel!  Our room was large and beautiful and the bathroom was fantastic, with thoughtful touches like a magnifying mirror and spot light directed at your face, slippers and separate tub and shower.  Breakfast was lovely in a room overlooking the garden.  Service was above and beyond in all areas.  ",5,2016,04,26
233,perfect weekend break,"Just had a weekend break at Ariel House, good location very close to Lansdowne Road Station, with easy access to centre. We also walked to centre several times lovely walk very easy to navigate close to nice parks. Hotel was with really nice stylish and very  clean, all staff were very happy and attentive. Breakfast was absolutely 5 star + room was large with nice furniture and a top quality bed. would highly recommend this hotel.
Thanks to all of you for making our weekend perfect.",5,2016,04,25
233,Last minute booking,"I left it late to book in Dublin and decided on Ariel house as my usual Hotel was full. I was pleasantly surprised by how simple yet comfortable it is. The lady at reception was very accommodating. The room is very relaxing but it could use a bigger Tv as its pretty tiny.

I will be back however.

233,"charming, victorian, lovely modern breakfast – want to come back!","this is a very charming house indeed, looks smaller than it is, and feels really more like a hotel than ""just"" an BnB. 
Service is very friendly, our twin rooms were spotless and decorated in victorian style, spacious, too. Breakfast was so good and much, that you kind of fell asleep right after  (beds were tempting, too ;–)
wonderful choice of things to be had for breakfast, from fresh fruit, pancakes, to full irish breakfast, scones, poached eggs on toast, you name it. lovely service, too, and nice winter garden to enjoy your coffee/tea in. 
very much recommandated!",5,2016,04,25
233,Breakfast to die for!,"My wife booked a Dublin trip as a surprise for my birthday and she chose Ariel House for our two day stay. What a treat. We were shown to our room immediately on arrival and were not disappointed.
The room was massive and the huge four poster bed was swallowed up in it. Everything was spotless and well laid out. The bathroom was big too and could have easily had another sink and toilet, and shower and bath.....!!
The breakfasts at Ariel are amazing and the staff so friendly we didn't want to come away. The pancakes with fruit and crème fraiche are an absolute must. The full Irish breakfast was perfectly cooked and delicious.
A perfect retreat for a perfect few days in a beautiful city.",5,2016,04,25
233,"Comfy bed, beautiful garden, delicious breakfast","Ariel House was the perfect B&B. We were given the Oscar Wilde room which was very large with a full sitting area and beautiful view of the gardens. Our bed was big and comfortable, and the bathroom was huge and very clean. We arrived early on our check in day and were invited to join for breakfast which was very kind and much appreciated. The breakfast was delicious, one of the best we had on our trip. Location was great for us- it's out of the city center, but just a 20 minute walk to Temple Bar area. We enjoyed being in a beautiful, residential neighborhood and walking into downtown for dinner and drinks. The staff were kind and welcoming as well. For the price, this place is unbeatable.

Re: getting there from the airport- we had planned to use the Aircoach but it was only running once an hour and we had just missed it, so we took a taxi instead. About 30 euros from the airport to Ariel House.",5,2016,04,25
233,Very comfortable,"Stayed here last week with my partner for 2 nights. We stayed upstairs and it was a great, quiet room with a comfortable bed. Clean bathroom with great shower pressure. Can't speak highly enough about the breakfast or the service. The scones and Irish breakfast were very tasty and the afternoon tea was a nice touch. Location is also great with the train into the city at the end of the street. Wifi was free and very good. The car parking is limited and small but there is parking on the street if you miss out. Would definitely stay again, highly recommended.",5,2016,04,25
233,Pleasant stay,"We had 2 nights at Ariel house then came back for a third night after 4 days on the road. When we came back the hotel upgraded our room at no extra cost.  Both bedrooms were in period furnishings which was nice but also had some need for more work.  We were unable to have a hot shower as the heat regulator was not working for the first two nights.  This wasn't a huge problem as there was a deep bath and plenty of hot water.      Also with the  very high ceilings the lighting was quite dim.  There is no lift  and we were on the first floor but the staff were more than willing to carry our suitcases.  Also there is off street parking but it is limited. Wifi is included and we found it quite fast enough.

Offsetting this we definitely had the best breakfasts in Ireland here. Our breakfasts were freshly cooked to order and there is an excellent choice.  The waitresses are attentive and all the staff were very happy to assist in any way they could. Special thanks to Elodie for looking after us on both our stays.

The afternoon teas and pastries were another highlight.
The neighborhood is up market and there are a variety of pubs and restaurants a short walk away.  As mentioned by others there is a train station close by and it is only 10 minutes into Dublin.

The hotel is 20 minutes from Dublin airport.

Would I stay here again, most definitely.",5,2016,04,25
233,Not what I expected based on reviews.,"I was rather disappointed with the quality of the room we stayed in. The polyester bed cover was rather dated and I tried to avoid touching it, the tv was the smallest I may have ever seen in a hotel room, the bathroom was basic and clean but nothing more, the most problematic part of our stay was the very slow internet service. I was glad to only have booked to stay here one night. Looking back at the reviews listed here I feel as though I stayed in a different hotel or was assigned the shabbiest room. It was situated in a lovely neighborhood but that seemed to make returning to the hotel that much more disappointing.",3,2016,04,24
233,Customer comes first,"Just returned from 2 separate stays.  Wonderful staff, great location , room and breakfast. Very caring , one desk attendant  even offered to drive us crosstown. Had tea and treats throughout the day. Would stay again.",5,2016,04,23
233,Fantastic stay,Stayed for one night. Received a warm welcome and was provided an early check-in as they knew we were arriving early via redeye. Room was spacious and clean. Breakfast was the best of the trip to Ireland. Staff was accommodating and very professional and pleasant. Highly recommend. ,5,2016,04,23
233,Best welcome to Ireland you could have,"First visit to Ireland and how lucky we were to choose Ariel House. The welcome, the friendliness, the genuine desire to help, advise and make our short stay a good one was as good as it gets. Many of the places we have stayed in the past (and there have been many as we are both getting on a bit) could learn how to ""do"" hospitality from Deirdre and her staff. Room was spotless and comfortable, breakfast great, cake and scones that needed serious restraint, and loads of help and contacts for our onward explorations. Handy location for the DART link into city centre, quiet area (the 6 nations rugby was over) and a perfect start to Irish hospitality. Highly recommended. Thanks for your kindnesses.",5,2016,04,22
233,Very Comfortable & great staff,I stayed one night on business in Dublin and stayed at Ariel a House. It is a lovely Victorian House that has been tastefully converted to a Hotel but retains its character. The reception area is unobtrusive and it feels like a home away from home. The home bakes in the drawing room are a lovely touch.  Breakfast was really nice and the coffee was AMAZING! Will definitely stay again. ,5,2016,04,22
233,Enjoyable stay :),We were in Dublin for the weekend and had the pleasure of staying in Ariel House. The accommodation is in close proximity to the city centre and the breakfast spread was excellent. I would certainly recommend staying here.,5,2016,04,22
233,A QUIET LITTLE HOTEL,"After  taking a train from the west coast ,  we arrived Dublin and the Ariel House.  The area was quiet,  the staff courteous and most helpful.  The breakfasts offered were diverse and yummy,  served with a smile.  I would caution anyone with a disability to possibly take time with a decision to stay at The Ariel House.   The front steps are quite steep and they are numerous.  Please also consider asking for a first floor room,  as again,  there are an additional two staircases to climb to an upper floor.   The rooms were immaculate,  although in my opinion very tired looking.  A bit of updating would be a blessing.",4,2016,04,20
233,Great Customer Service!,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful 3 night stay at Ariel House. I have to say it was the customer service that was made it stand out. This was our first time to Ireland and on the 9 hour flight over, I had spilled a glass of red wine on the airplane onto my lap (90 minutes into flight...). When we were checked in and settled into our room, I had asked about laundry service or how I would be able to wash my jeans. I forgot her name now, (Celia maybe?) but she took the pants, had them washed and delivered back into my room in no time. I was very grateful for this speedy, hassle free action! 
On top of that, the staff at breakfast was lovely and we enjoyed the food every morning. The hotel is not directly in the heart of the city but one day we enjoyed the walk into the downtown core, and another day we easily took the DART train. The staff was helpful with recommendations  and again very helpful in helping us get to the airport. The room was unique and full of character. If you're looking for modern, this probably isn't the place for you, but that is what made it so fun. Our room was quite spacious for the two of us. The blowdryer didn't really work in our bathroom and we were told there was another one in the wardrobe but there wasn't. That wasn't a big deal. Our TV wasn't working the first night and when I mentioned it, it was fixed in no time. 

All and all the stay here was great. Very close to the train and our bus from the airport dropped us a few blocks away. The front staff was what made this place shine!",5,2016,04,20
233,Wonderful small hotel,"We recently enjoyed a wonderful stay at the Ariel House in Dublin. The service was excellent, as all of the staff go out of their way to make you feel at home and comfortable.  Our room was a gem, and the included breakfast is amazing!! Although it is located about a 20-30 walk from the city center, we never felt as though we were too far from anything. It is also a stone's throw from the Landsdowne DART station, making it especially convenient for sightseeing outside of Dublin as well. We would highly recommend a stay at the Ariel House!",5,2016,04,18
233,Birthday Treat,"Visited Dublin as part of my Husbands 50th Birthday celebrations. Hotel was lovely & staff were all superb. Service from start to finish A1. Lovely touch with the homemade biscuits in the room. & tea, Coffee & cakes in the Drawing Room in the afternoon. Special thanks to Deirdre for the little birthday cake at Breakfast. ",5,2016,04,15
233,Excellent,"What a great experience ! The guest house is located a bit outside downtown in a quiet area and is easily reachable by bus.

Everything from check in to check out worked perfectly. The place is very cosy, spotless clean and all the members of the personnel are super efficient and extremely friendly. Everything we asked for they were able to do.

Breakfast was excellent with a good choice of warm meals coming straight out of the kitchen based on order. We also had afternoon tea once, which was also very nice.

Honestly this was one of my best accomodation experiences in a long time, I can warmly recommend this place for anyone visiting Dublin, especially couples.",5,2016,04,15
233,Fantastic hotel,"Very welcoming and friendly staff.  The room was amazing, much better than expected with a gorgeous 4 poster bed. The breakfasts were absolutely scrumptious and a lovely touch of free tea/coffee and cake in the lounge every afternoon. Just a short walk from the DART and bus stop. We would highly recommend and will definitely stay there again. Thank you for a wonderful stay :)",5,2016,04,14
233,Charming hotel .,"Had a six  night stay at Ariel house and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves . 
Friendly competent staff who really  can't do enough to make your stay comfortable .
Lovely rooms and brilliant breakfast . 
Minutes away for Dart station which gives fast access to many beauty spots up and down the coast as well as Dublin town centre .",5,2016,04,13
233,Wonderful,"Just really loved this bed and breakfast. It was exactly what we wanted: charm, excellent service, fantastic breakfasts and good sleeps. It also has off street parking, not many, but we never had a problem. All and all it is a place I would HIGHLY recommend.

Thanks!",5,2016,04,12
233,"An outstanding hotel, within 20 minutes walk of the centre of Dublin","Have just returned from a short break in Ireland, including 2 days in Dublin.  The Ariel Hotel was superb, and is highly recommended.  The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful; breakfasts were excellent; and the room was first class - we stayed in one of the junior suites.  The hotel's location was also ideal, within 20 minutes of the centre.  Located close to the Aviva Stadium, the hotel is also an attractive option for anyone attending a match.  I would definitely return.",5,2016,04,12
233,We felt like an honored guest!,"My husband and I stayed two nights at Ariel House.  It was perfect!  We flew in from San Francisco and were tired and jet lagged when we made it there.  We were early, so our room wasn't quite ready, and they brought out tea, coffee and some amazing scones and pastries for us to enjoy in the parlor.  
The hotel is in a great neighborhood and is close to DART, however we enjoyed walking everywhere.  (It felt great after being couped up in a plane for so long!)
Our room had was large and had a fireplace and a huge bathroom with a separate tub and shower.  The bed was very comfortable and it was quiet at night. We both slept very well!
Our favorite part of the stay was the incredible breakfasts!!  They were spectacular and worth the trip to Dublin alone!  
That being said, the staff - without exception - was also fabulous! They would go out of their way to make us feel at home and assist us.  It really made a difference.
We accidentally left our passports in the room when we departed and they tracked us down and managed to get them to us, which was a bit tricky due to the Easter holiday and the fact that we were staying in different places each day! (Thank you all so very much!!!)
Ariel House will be at the top of our list for travel in Ireland and I would recommend it highly and without hesitation to anyone looking to visit Dublin!",5,2016,04,11
233,Cozy House,"I booked this hotel very last minute for a day trip to Dublin. It's about a 20-30 min bus ride from Dublin International. There is a train station right down the sidewalk from the hotel that takes you into the heart of the city. The staff was extremely welcoming and helpful. I loved the cozy ""bed and breakfast"" feel. My room was bigger than I thought and was kind of in its own wing of the building, which was nice and quite. I was thankful for the free wifi, since my data plan expired. I was very pleased and comfortable during my stay. I recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again! ",5,2016,04,10
233,A very relaxing stay,The whole ambience of the Ariel House is wonderful. The staff are particularly attentive and everyone was so friendly and helpful. The breakfast and afternoon teas were both delicious. Situated in a quiet location within 25 mins walk of the centre and very close to the DART train if the rain prevents a walk! Would definitely stay again if again in Dublin.,5,2016,04,07
233,Charm8ing and efficient,"It was a delight to stay here. The staff were friendly, welcoming, helpful and knowledgeable. The room was large and well appointed. The breakfasts were particularly special. 
The hotel is located adjacent to the rugby stadium and there are excellent transport facilities on the doorstep and quite a few good eateries just a short walk away.",5,2016,04,07
233,First class place to stay!,"Second time staying here and can't wait to go back again!
You are welcomed so warmly and nothing is too much trouble. Staff on reception and at breakfast are professional and friendly. Accommodation is very comfortable and clean with an early check-in time which is unusual. Drawing room is a pleasant area with complimentary tea and goodies, a nice touch. Breakfast is delicious with a wide choice of quality food. Convenient to Dart, city centre and good restaurants and of course the Aviva stadium. All in all, a great experience. Thank you!",5,2016,04,07
233,Lovely start to our honeymoon,"Having arrived on the ferry from Holyhead the hotel was just a short and relatively straight forward drive. 

There was parking available on arrival and I was very impressed by the initial impression of the hotel and the neighbourhood in general. 

We were greeted at reception by an exceptionally friendly lady who offered us complimentary tea and cakes in the lounge. She was happy to chat with us and took an interest in our wedding story, although I probably didn't give her much choice!

The room was very large with incredibly high ceilings and a big, comfy bed. It was clean and tidy and overlooked the road which wasn't noisy. 

It's a short walk into the centre through pleasant streets. 

The breakfast the following day was delicious and I would highly recommend a stay here based on service and interaction with staff alone. ",5,2016,04,05
233,Just Perfect!,"My wife and I stayed for two nights, a real wonderful house. Room was very large, the bed was so comfortable. Location was very convenient to the tram, four minute walk. The breakfasts were fantastic, as were the servers.",5,2016,04,04
233,All good!,"Ariel house is in a good location, right by the Aviva stadium and very handy for the dart.
Our room was very spacious and exceptionally clean. Bed was comfy. 
Breakfasts wonderful. 
Staff were lovely, nothing too much trouble.",5,2016,04,04
233,Brilliant staff and breakfast,"We arrived early morning to drop our bags off and were offered complimentary tea and homemade scones in the lounge which were delicious! Then it was just two minutes walk down the road to the DART station to get into the city centre. This place is also ideally located for the Aviva Stadium if you're a sports fan! On returning to the hotel later in the day, we were shown to our hotel room which was a Herbert Mews room (downstairs, in an extension out the back of the original house.) The room itself was tired and worn, in need of a lick of paint and sprucing up. The bedside table hadn't been dusted and one of the light fixtures had a hole beneath with exposed wires! The bed was only a double bed, normally I would expect at least a kingsize in hotels nowadays so we didn't have the best nights' sleep. Breakfast in the morning was great though, wide range of food available including gluten free options. For service and food this hotel is 5 stars but unfortunately our room was only 3 stars at best.",4,2016,04,04
233,Sad to leave!,"We visited Dublin for the Easter weekend and had a wonderful stay at Ariel House. Situated in a lovely neighbourhood right next to the Aviva Stadium, from the minute you arrive you are made to feel welcome and at home. Our room was huge overlooking the garden, with a great bathroom. Extremely quiet and dark with the heavy curtains so slept very well in the comfy bed. Breakfast was fantastic, so much to choose from and cooked fresh to order. As it was Easter we were greeted with some little chocolate eggs outside our door on Sunday morning, a nice touch. The only slight downside to this place is that it is about 30 mins walk from Dublin centre, but it's an easy route and totally worth it we thought for the price when you compare to very expensive city centre hotels. Overall would highly recommended Ariel House. Thank you to all the staff you made our trip :)",5,2016,04,02
233,Excellent as always,"Stayed here for the Easter weekend with my sister. The whole experience was wonderful, nothing is to much trouble for the staff. Beautiful room, spotlessly clean and great location. Breakfast is always superb. The fact that I have stayed here numerous times says it all.",5,2016,04,02
233,Very Nice and Spacious,"Our room was very nice, comfortable and very spacious.  We ended up with s double queen room due to availability.  Parking was a small problem but the staff helped with that.  They have someone on site 24/7 and were very accommodating.  The food was very good.  We enjoyed our stay here.  I would stay again.",5,2016,04,02
233,Perfectly situated for Aviva Stadium,"I have just stayed here with four of my friends down for rugby match.  Perfect setting just around the corner from Stadium.  Lovely rooms.  Excellent top notch breakfast menu, 6 star to be honest.  Lovely helpful welcome.  Staff are so warm, friendly and ever so helpful, nothing too much trouble. Lovely touch is the tea/coffee and freshly baked cakes on offer in afternoon.  Close to excellent restaurants.  Will be recommending Ariel House extremely highly and definitely will be using it again and again.  Thankyou to all for making our stay a wonderful experience",5,2016,03,31
233,Best Address in Dublin,Stay away from expensive downtown hotels and choose this friendly home away from home. Breakfast is incredible and personnel over the top friendly. We had an old style room twice as large as a regular hotel one and a parking place for the car.,5,2016,03,30
233,Fantastic,"We were very impressed with this guest house. Given coffee and home baked cake and cookies on arrival as room was not ready as we arrived early. Clean, comfortable and quiet room. Able to leave car parked for day after check out. Received gift of box of butler s mini easter eggs and scroll on easter Sunday morning. Would definitely recommend this. Great location next to rds, aviva and dart station.",5,2016,03,27
233,"Gorgeous place, wonderful breakfast","My husband and I stayed at Ariel House our first night in Dublin.  We arrived early and were greeted warmly and seated with tea and pastries while our room was prepared. Our room was breathtaking. It surprisingly large and beautifully furnished.  

The complementary breakfast was delicious.  My husband enjoyed a full Irish breakfast and was very pleased. I had the brioche French toast with poached plums and it was the best breakfast of our entire trip.  

When we return to Dublin, we will absolutely return to Ariel House and we recommend it to anyone traveling to Dublin.  It is lovely.",5,2016,03,25
233,Gem of a hotel,"We have just recently returned from a three day trip to Dublin, staying at Ariel house. There perfect choice, great staff, great breakfast and a very elegant and spacious room.  We didn't expect the hotel to be in such a nice area, and it was within pleasant walking distance into the city centre. Regarding the breakfast, everything was just perfect from the quality of the food, to the presentation to the friendliness of the staff. On our final day we were leaving at 6.50am and the staff put us up a lovely breakfast to go. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if we ever return to Dublin - couldn't recommend enough!",5,2016,03,24
233,Excellent service for food intollerance,"We stayed here for a rugby match in March 2016 and couldn't have asked for better service.  I had emailed prior to our visit to enquire about provision for breakfast as I have some food intolerances.   They replied  straight away and were very informative and helpful.  When I went for breakfast the staff knew who I was and what room number I was in, they made egg free and dairy free bread especially and were very knowledgeable regarding my options for breakfast.  On top of this we had tea, coffee and pastries on arrival, more offered to us after the rugby match and our names were remembered at check out.  Very comfortable beds and linen too!
Will definitely be back, was extremely impressed with the accommodation and service.",5,2016,03,22
233,outstanding!,"Faultless and a real credit to the team. Spotlessly clean, very helpful staff, lovely rooms, breakfast to die for and a plentiful choice. I can't recommend highly enough. Quiet location but easily walkable to a couple of lovely bars, staff will help with dinner reservations/recommendations and taxis etc nothing is too much trouble. Just a really lovely stay overall.",5,2016,03,21
233,Charming,"Stayed two nights in this charming hotel, rooms are clean, spacious and furnished in style. Breakfast has a variety of choice and is very tasty. Staff are friendly and helpful, would definitely stay again if visiting the fair city. Avoid the Jonathan Swift room if your a 'big unit' like myself...toilet is too close to the bath.",5,2016,03,21
233,Would stay again ,"We Stayed here as a family of four for two nights on the 18th and 19th of March.  First time to Ariel house, parking is very tight but manageable.  On arrival we were greeted at reception by the lovely Cecilia. We were quickly shown to our room which was a family room with two double beds on ground level. It was spotless, bright and spacious.  The dart is a just a 2 minute walk from Ariel house and we were in pearse street in 20 mins or less.  The dart leaves every 15 minutes and runs till 11:30pm so it's so handy in and out of town. We were going to a rugby match on Saturday at the Aviva and you will never get it so handy! It's just a few minutes walk... 4 mins to our seat to be exact.  Perfect.   Breakfast at Ariel house was very good. It's cooked to order and very tasty. Lovely selection of Fresh breads, cereals and cheeses also.  I have stayed in hotels in Dublin city centre, expensive and budget but really liked it here. It is a b&b with no restaurant or bar but the price and near location to everything makes it attractive. On Saturday I asked the girl on reception if there was anywhere we could eat nearby before the match and without hesitation she picked up the phone and booked us a table in a nearby pizza restaurant called paulies.   That helped us greatly as we didn't have to go in search of restaurants ourselves in the middle of the rugby crowd. I will definitely be returning here again as the staff are friendly and attentive and it is value for your hard earned money.   It has five stars from me.

233,Nice Little Place Great Location,"I stayed in Ariel House recently for a gig in 3 Arena, and it was perfect. We got the room at a decent price and its location is convenient to get to the 3 Arena by taxi or the Bord Gais, and the Aviva Stadium is right next door.

We had stayed previously and had luckily enough been given one of the big rooms with a massive bay window overlooking Landsdowne Road, this time we were not so lucky. This time the room we were given was adequate but if I'm honest it was a bit tired, and really could do with a bit of TLC.

The bathroom was perfect and the shower was lovely, but mind your leg on the heated towel rail if your on the toilet.

Breakfast was delicious and our server was nice but never explained the continental cold buffet to us, I mean it didn't bother us because we knew the run of it, but at the same time maybe she should have taken the chance. We were the only people in the breakfast room (no we weren't late) so it wasn't like she was rushed off her feet.

The parking I must say is limited at the front but the car is safe and that is the main thing. All in all Ariel House is a lovely place to stay and I would recommend it.",4,2016,03,19
233,Friendly and relaxed with lovely staff,"We stayed here just one night while our son took an entry exam at University College Dublin. The breakfast was excellent, the staff extremely warm and helpful and the surroundings really charming and relaxed. We will be booking a longer trip here definitely in the near future.",5,2016,03,17
233,Gorgeous Place,"Stayed here over the weekend with 2 friends. Not one bad word to say about the house. Its stunning! Decor was fab, we had a room with 2 doubles, was so spaceous. The staff were the nicest ever they were so welcoming the man at reception even took some bags to our room for us. Breakfast was delicious. I would definetly stay here again!",5,2016,03,15
233,Third time's the charm!,"Ariel House has become a personal favourite place to stay in Dublin for good reason - they offer outstanding accommodations and service that keeps me coming back! This time, our flight arrived in Dublin very early in the morning, and although I had sent a request for an early check in (to which they responded that they would do their best to accommodate, and offered to store luggage and serve tea and scones…can't go wrong with that!!) the rooms weren't quite ready. Without hesitation, we  were offered breakfast, which we gratefully accepted - and WOW! It's fantastic! A lovely buffet of fresh local baked goods, fruit and cheeses (their blue cheese is the best I've ever had!) as well as freshly prepared hot entrees (the poached eggs with smoked salmon is epic!) Once we were fed and rested, we felt ready to take on this wonderful city! It has convenient access to the public rail system, DART, a three minute walk to the Lansdowne station. The rooms are charmingly decorated, with all of the conveniences you need  -if you do find you've forgotten something or need assistance,  the staff make it abundantly clear that nothing is too much trouble - they are always happy to help with travel arrangements, directions, making phone calls on your behalf to secure reservations, taxis, etc.  At one point, the chef was available to transport some fellow guests to their destination as their ride didn't show..now, that's above and beyond. 
I appreciate the exceptional service this lovely guesthouse offers, and would highly recommend it!",5,2016,03,13
233,A great visit to Dublin,"We have just returned from another excellent visit to Dublin and Ariel House. We arrived early and were offered refreshments while waiting for our room. We were shown to a lovely comfortable room with excellent ensuite facilities. Our breakfast was superb and such good friendly service. We had to check out in the morning but were free to leave all our luggage. As we were attending the rugby match at the close by Aviva Stadium we were encouraged to come back and have tea etc before heading home. When we got there a number of other guests were doing the same and there were lovely sausage rolls, cakes etc with tea and coffee and the staff working non stop. This is a tremendous B&B and I would recommend it highly. Their service couldn't be bettered. Even when we were eventually leaving for the train a male member of staff insisted on bringing our luggage down the front steps. All these little touches mean a lot especially to the older generation as we are. We look forward to returning next month again for another visit. Thank you Ariel House.

233,Truly amazing place to stay. ,"Stayed here for my husbands 30th. Ariel house was completely perfect. The people couldn't do enough, the room was beautiful, breakfast and afternoon cakes were great. We had to leave for our flight at 5 in the morning and they even prepared us breakfast-to-go! 
Would come back to Dublin just to stay here. 
Really cannot recommend this place enough. Only wish we could've stayed longer. 

",5,2016,03,11
233,Loved our stay!,Loved the place.  A little ways from the city center however enjoyed the quietness of the location.  Did not take long to get taxi to city center and back.  Breakfast was very nice.  Staff was helpful and very accommodating.,5,2016,03,10
233,Ariel Guest House,"I enjoyed this beautiful guesthouse just outside Dublin. My room was a comfortable size and had nice furniture. Unfortunately there was a stale odor in the room  so I kept a window open. I had no hot water in my shower for two days and the problem was finally fixed. The breakfasts were outstanding and the servers delightful. I reall liked the proximity to public transportation. I would certainly stay here in the future, but pack a can of air freshener.",5,2016,03,09
233,Loved this place,The Ariel House is a terrific place to stay.  Nice location and easy walk to attractions and restaurants.  The clean large/huge room were great.  It had a nice sitting area in the room to relax from a busy day.  Loved the atmosphere and the Victorian charm.  The staff very friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend this place to stay.,5,2016,03,09
233,Very pleased for my inspiration to choose this place,"The place where you feel like home. And if your home is not so good, Ariel is just the place where you can feel like in the house you desire. Best breakfast, amazing pancakes, good atmosphere with the afternoon tea and cookies, fiendly and helpfull staff, beautiful building, close to the center. Loved it in all the ways.",5,2016,03,09
233,A wonderful gem tucked away literally underneath the impressive aviva stadium and so worth finding!,"A beautiful hotel, spacious rooms, furnished in keeping to the period and also wonderfully warm for a winters short break. Great staff who were so friendly and helpful and the best breakfast selection I've ever enjoyed! Need at least a week to try all the tempting breakfast alternatives but I so loved my poached eggs with either crispy bacon or smoked salmon! A wonderful selection on the buffet table too and I enjoyed trying the Irish cheeses.
Afternoon high tea was also a welcome addition with delicious scones and the wonderful banana bread.
Its a nice 20 min stroll in to the centre or take the Dart train or No 4 or 7 bus, both are nearby.
I know I'll be heading back, no contest!",5,2016,03,01
233,Wonderful Stay!,"Decided to overnight in Dublin as a treat for my daughter's forthcoming 21st. Birthday. Having stayed in this wonderful hotel before, it was the automatic choice for this special occasion. When I phoned in advance, the lovely Cecilia assured me that we would be allocated a nicely appointed room in the main house.......I have stayed in some of the other rooms which are equally comfortable, well furnished & spotlessly clean. On arrival around 1pm, we were given such a warm welcome by both Cecilia on reception & the General Manager, Deirdre. They both acknowledged the 'Birthday Girl' & when we returned to our room later that evening, there was a little note with a complimentary jar of cookies. It is these little touches plus the complimentary tea/coffee/scones etc. in the Drawing Room on arrival which make this establishment stand head & shoulders over the competition! Breakfast the next morning was fantastic, wide selection & fresh as the main course was made to order!.....a rarity nowadays.  The only negative comment that I would make is the light in the bedrooms is not particularly good making reading difficult. This is probably due to the fact that this is beautiful Old Victorian Building. Anyway thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2016,02,22
233,Great Location - Reasonable Price,"The Ariel House is right at the edge of Dublin proper and no more than a 10 minute walk from the core sights. The DART station (metro or subway) is just two blocks away so you are in a perfect area to enjoy Dublin's sights. The staff was helpful, the room adequate in size and for the price, its is a good bargain considering how prices rise pretty quickly as you near the hotels in the core central area of Dublin.",4,2016,02,20
233,Another amazing stay!,"Another wonderful 2 night stay at this lovely home from home. 
Breakfast was gorgeous with so much choice and afternoon tea looks amazing I will definitely be booking this next time we visit.
The room as always was spotless. 
If you are visiting Dublin don't hesitate booking to stay here! ",5,2016,02,20
233,Great b&b,"This b&b is an ideal place to stay when visiting Dublin. Staff are very friendly, the rooms was big & very comfortable. Breakfast was fantastic as were the cakes and scones available in the drawing room in the afternoon. Hotel is less than 2 minutes walk away from the dart making it easy to get into Dublin. Would certainly stay there again. ",5,2016,02,20
233,Great stay,"We stayed as a family group for three nights ,and were very impressed ,by the friendly staff,and most excellent breakfast,plenty of choice and beautifully served.
,
The staff were helpful,accomadating and the complementary tea ,coffee and cakes were a welcome touch! 
All our rooms were generous  ,spotlessly clean with large ensuite bathrooms.
I wiould definitely recommend Ariel house.",5,2016,02,18
233,"Amazing stay at a victorian house, just outside of the center of dublin","This place was great! The breakfast was amazing (and free!) and the staff was very attentive and accommodating. The afternoon tea/coffee and snacks were a very nice touch and much appreciated. The ingredients used to make all of the food are locally sourced and very fresh. The room we stayed in had a very decent sized bed. The only thing I could say I didn't like about this place, which it more than made up for in other aspects in my opinion, was that there was no fridge in the room. The location was great: very close to a DART stop and within walking distance of many attractions including the Dublin Castle, the Irish Whiskey Museum, the National Wax Museum Plus, St. Stephen's Green park and shopping center, and the archaeological part of the National Museum of Ireland. All of these are within a mile and a half walking distance. Within merely 5 miles, driving, distance from Ariel House is the Dublin Zoo, Kilmainham Gaol, and the Guinness Storehouse. There's plenty more to do, these are just the places we had on our list for the 3 days we stayed here. I'd definitely recommend eating at the PHX Bistro, 3.6 miles away, for dinner one night if you like a romantic, relaxed atmosphere with really good Irish cuisine.",5,2016,02,16
233,A Lackluster Hodgepodge of Old and New!,"The hotel is located away from the city center.  We learned that you don't need to take a taxi for 11euros to the city center if you have good walking legs.  The trip, by foot, to the center takes about 20-30 minutes.  It is a very enjoyable walk.  If you want a great cup of coffee, stop in at 3fe, 32/34 Lower Grand Canal Street.  This will increase your time from beginning to end.  

Now on to the hotel.  It is made up of a number of buildings, some old, some new.  I was extremely disappointed by the entire ambiance of the place.  The staff was a bit standoffish, the room that tea is served in lacked any kind of warmth or charm.  Lots of big heavy furniture, no flowers, no candles, no music.  The tea service was also a disappointment.  

Our room was on the first floor in the old house.  The ceilings were high, the bed twas below the new standard of having padded mattresses and wonderful comfy douvets.  The room again lacked any ambiance.  Everything had a color range of dark brown to beige.  The bathroom was remodeled, but the toilet made noise, the shower sprayed beyond the barrier.  It just wasn't a comfortable place to hang out in.

The breakfast room was horrible.  Again, cold, non-charming, lacking ambiance, flowers.  They did play 1950 Frank Sinatra music if that is what you are into.  The breakfast buffet was again unappealing.  Sorry I am so nitpicky, but I stay in a LOT of hotels every year all over the world.  This is not even remotely one of the best places I have ever stayed at.  Everything on the buffet had a color pallet of white to beige to beige to beige.  Really unappetizing.  They could do a lot better.  The menu has a number of items to select from and the presentation is good.  

The staff was unremarkable and not very friendly.  Didn't make me feel welcome.  Didn't seem to care if there were customers there or not.  Didn't appear to take pride in their hotel. The sitting room always had dirty cups and plates on the coffee table.  Maybe this was off season for them, but I wasn't impressed by anything about this place.  Sorry!",3,2016,02,15
233,Bit out of the way but serviced by the Dart,"Had a twin room for my sister and I.  We found it easy to get around with a good map to guide us.  in a lovely area and right near the stadium so not sure I would have been happy being there on a match day unless I was going to a match.

Breakfast was provided in a bag for our early trip to the airport on departure.

I only gave a very good due to the distance away and it is a little dated but I would stay again",4,2016,02,14
233,Faultless,"Chose this hotel due to fabulous reviews and closeness  to Aviva Stadium and was not disappointed. We had a room on the 1st floor overlooking Lansdowne Road. The room was spacious, clean and well furnished. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. The breakfast was superb. The hotel is located close to the Aviva stadium and to the DART train line into Dublin city centre. If you're looking for a warm and friendly stay in Dublin this is the place for you. ",5,2016,02,11
233,Highly recommend this wonderful hotel,"I highly recommend this wonderful hotel. The staff are very friendly and helpful with best service I have seen. The room we had was excellent with a lovely comfortable bed. The complimentary drinks and cakes in the lounge are a very special touch and the traditional Irish breakfast with all the other lovely things to eat was fantastic and made a great start to the day. It's location is good to, just outside the city centre but very near a DART railway station which gets you quickly and cheaply into the centre, you can walk there in under 30 minutes. If you are a rugby fan then this the place to stay as its very near the aviva stadium. But if you are not a rugby fan then it is still one the best places to stay in Dublin. We will certainly be back.",5,2016,02,09
233,We had a fantastically relaxing weekend with great food,"We recently spent a weekend in Ariel House and the location, the staff, the comfort and the food were all top class.  We will definitely be back.  Breakfast has fantastic choice and delivers on flavour.",5,2016,02,09
233,Wonderful Lodging,"Everything was first class:  beautiful rooms, fantastic staff, and quiet location.

You can tell a lot about a hotel by how the staff deals with an emergency and when one came up for us, the staff did a great job.  

We ordered a cab for the airport the day before our departure.  When the cab didn't show, the staff went into action.  They called every cab company in Dublin, but could find a cab.  It was pouring rain, which make getting a cab almost impossible.  As a last ditch effort, the porter walked to a busy intersection and stood there trying to hail every cab that went by.  One finally stopped and we just made it to the airport on time.

The staff went out of their way to get us to the airport and we are so grateful.",5,2016,02,08
233,Lovely!,A very nice B&B within walking distance of Hop-On Hop-Off bus to tour Dublin and walkable into Dublin as well.  The breakfast was superb and the accommodations were lovely.  It is a bit of an upscale place to stay and the prices reflect this.,5,2016,02,04
233,I'll be back...,"I stayed in Ariel House for 4 nights in November 2015 when I was in Dublin for my visit to The Web Summit, so this is a long overdue review. 
Ariel House reminds me of visiting an extremely welcoming, warm and friendly home, but with the independence and privacy of a hotel. I found it incredibly convenient to walk almost everywhere, or jump on the DART,  about 30 seconds walk from the entrance. 
Three things stood out for me above everything else:
Breakfast was wonderful with excellent quality ingredients and an amazing choice on offer. I looked forward to it so much every morning.  
There's a lovely atmosphere in the place, one where you feel most welcome. That doesn't happen by accident, and I experienced it from every member of staff. 
The extremely gracious and generous manner in which everything was dealt with e.g I asked if I could have a family member back for afternoon tea one day and to add it to my bill. No charge. Another example is that I missed having dinner one evening and was looking for somewhere very close by, for a simple snack. The person at reception offered me a plate of bread, cheese and scones which was perfect.
At a time when many hotels, B&Bs, Airbnb places hiked up their prices up to threefold for the Web Summit, it was refreshing to experience that that was not the case here. 
That level of decency runs throughout every aspect of the running of Ariel House, in my experience. 

I've just booked again for another stay and I'm really looking forward to it. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone wishing to visit Dublin, who's after a good value, comfortable stay with an excellent breakfast and superior service.",5,2016,02,01
233,Lovely Choice In Dublin,"Ariel house is a great choice somewhat outside of the center of Dublin but still walkable to the center (or train service adjacent).  We had a spacious room, with delicious breakfast, and complimentary afternoon tea in the parlor.  Overall it is more like staying with a (wealthy) great Aunt than a hotel.  A highlight of our trip to Ireland.",5,2016,01,30
233,Lovely privately run hotel,"Fabulous place with very good service. Cavernous rooms - plenty of space & extremely comfy bed. 

Good location with nice bars & restaurants close by ... on the doorstep of the Aviva too. 

Friendly & polite service.",4,2016,01,28
233,Super - Old style luxury accommodation and top class food and service,Had a beautiful 2 night stay in a fab suite at Ariel House - 4 poster bed and beautiful furniture. Arrived late but was offered tea - coffee and home made cakes - Breakfast is top class with attention to detail. Homemade granola - freshly baked scones. Only sorry that I couldn't stay longer - will definetly be back,5,2016,01,26
233,Afternoon Tea is the best in Dublin,"without a doubt the best afternoon tea i have ever been to. the venue is vintage and stylish, the staff are so welcoming friendly and go out of their way to make your experience enjoyable and relaxing. everything from the vintage china, beautiful decor, delicious treats and sandwiches, friendly staff and attention to finer details make this venue the best venue in dublin for a nice enjoyable afternoon tea.

there are always lots of plates of sandwiches (which they give you the option of having second serving of) delicious bite sized desserts of mini vanilla melts (amazing!!) chocolate cup cakes, cream and jam scones, tea cake, marble cake, coffee and walnut cake, vanilla sponge cake, fruit cake, cream and rubharb in shot glasses, lemon churd, are some of the homemade delicious treats served that make the mouth water! 

all treats and tea are prepared fresh and served with excellent attention to detail. smiling faces greet and serve you and there is no time limit or anyone rushing you out the door. you are seated and can enjoy it all at you own pace. 

i have been to other establishments such as the Shelbourne, the Merrion, the Westin and the Westbury and NO VENUE comes close to the standard Ariel House delivers. it is the only venue in Dublin that i recommend highly to friends and family. i have been nearly 10 times and always give Ariel House 10/10 top marks! (marks which i give to no other venue) 

thank you to ariel house for the consistant amazing experience you deliver and i cannot wait to return again soon!",5,2016,01,24
233,perfect,"What a wonderful one night stay - huge room, tastefully furnished - downstairs Oscar Wilde -looking onto garden. fab bathroom with corner bath and large shower. Everything was clean- reception staff very helpful, welcoming tea coffee and homemade cakes in comfortable lounge. breakfast was superb -cooked to order, with delicious home made bread. will definitely return on next visit to Dublin. ",5,2016,01,20
233,Fantastic stay. ,"We have just returned from a long weekend away staying at Ariel House. It was fantastic. The staff really do go out of their way to make you feel special and your trip one to remember. 

We arrived at the hotel very early, staff say is in the lounge and provided tea, coffee and fresh pastries giving us ideas on how we could spend our day. They consistently went above and beyond what I expected, making you feel special, helping book excursions/taxis etc. We had to leave the hotel at 5am to catch our flight on the day of our departure. Waiting at reception for us was a takeaway breakfast which was just what we needed. 

The hotel is around a 20 minute walk into the centre, we never used the rail system but used the ""hailo"" taxi app which the hotel recommended to us. It costs around 10-13€ in a taxi for 4 people. 

I would definitely recommend Ariel House to friends. 

Thank you for a lovely stay. ",5,2016,01,18
233,Excellent and homely ,"Having done my research on places to stay for a short trip to Dublin I decided to stay here and I sure was happy I decided that I went with Ariel guesthouse ! 
I feel the standout experience was the breakfast and must thank the very helpful and courteous lady working very hard in the dining room as it was a busy time yet she managed to keep the show on the road with a smile! The food was out of this world , having stayed in 5 star hotels around the world , this was hands down one of the best I have had and I am a fussy eater ! No short cuts taken with quality of food and that was abundantly clear ! 
The room itself was cosy, like a home from home!  Nice touches in the ensuite with toiletries and slippers ! 
All in all a fantastic experience and would stay again without a doubt!",5,2016,01,17
233,Lovely Hotel! Wonderful Service! Great Locale!,"Stayed here for three lovely nights! Clean rooms, helpful, friendly and efficient staff. Breakfast was superb and they have a lovely drawing room (parlour), if you call that; for guest to read and indulge in either tea or coffee and cakes/pastries throughout the day! 

Complimentary, of course! I loved their scones, tea-cakes, madeleines, just to name a few! 

I have only one complaint; the position of the shower head. It's fairly hazardous for tall people. If you're shampooing and rinsing your hair; you might forget that the shower head is positioned too low and ended up hurting the back or the front of your head. I did ask the reception about changing to another room but the hotel was full at that time. I've gotta to remind my husband each time before he bathes. 

But all in all, it was a wonderful place to stay. Also, the location was great! I would say it took us no longer than 6 minutes to walk from Ariel House to take a train to town. DART is the overground (train) service very much like the tube/train services in the UK. Its roughly about 15 minutes to town depending on which stop. 

If you're fan of Rugby (Union), AVIVA stadium is a few doors away and the IRFU ten minutes from Ariel House.",4,2015,12,27
233,Homely spot in busy city.,"I stayed at Ariel House on the Saturday before Christmas and after reading various tripadvisor eulogies, I was really looking forward to it. I was not disappointed.
We tried to park in the city on arrival, but that was impossible so I just drove on out to Lansdowne Road and parked on the premises; glad to welcome me and not a problem. Best way back into town; the DART which was all of a one minute walk away.
Anyway, we shopped and returned by the same method of transport to a very warm welcome, coffee, cake, scones; whatever was available. Great start. Then to our room: wow factor for sure with four poster bed etc. It was just beautiful, warm and cosy......and so close to the Aviva, I just had to go and watch Leinster in action. Stadium seat to cup of coffee in hand after, approximately 4 minutes!!
Breakfast was a delight with a great variety on offer and all cooked to taste and on request which is a lovely change from the ""help yourself"" of most hotels.
We left the car agin for the day and darted into the city for a final walk around. No problem. ""Call back in, use the facilities and have coffee and a scone,"" they said. We did; it was just so pleasant to feel that people cared about us and they did.
By the way, the staff were superb. Cecilia shared some great stories with us and nothing was too much trouble-the way it should be but rarely is.

Well done again and ""we'll be back""

Many thanks",5,2015,12,22
233,Great Service-Even after we left!,"Stayed here for a week while working, from the outset there was nothing they could not do to help. A beautiful room, and an absolutely delicious breakfast. When I arrived home I realised after a week of busy work that I had forgotten my boots. The staff were very lovely and prompt in getting them back to me. Close proximity to train station and RDS means you are near everything you want as well, without being stuck in the bustle of the city. Great place to stay in Dublin.",5,2015,12,21
233,Amazing!!!!,"If you are going to Dublin, then this is the place to stay - it is amazing from start to finish!!!  Just across the road from a Dart station or a 10 Euro taxi ride from the bottom of Grafton Street.  There is a beautiful sitting room with huge settees where tea, coffee, scones and buns are on offer all afternoon and evening.  As a group of 8 we came in after a meal out each night and were able to sit and chat and have coffee.  The 2 young concierges were so friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  One even recommended a great restaurant for us and phoned to book us a table - so ask for their advice on anything as they know what they are talking about.  Breakfast was absolutely amazing again - try the berry pots with yogurt and the fresh pancakes with bacon and maple syrup!!!!!  Scrumptious!!!!  I cannot wait to go back again.",5,2015,12,17
233,Lovely experience,Great location with easy access to city centre. Comfortable room with a lot of character. Superb breakfast. Staff are friendly and helpful. Parking is available but limited.  Hope to stay there again soon!,5,2015,12,15
233,"Friendly staff, fabulous breakfast","Great location, close to Dart,great selection of pubs and restaurants. Comfortable modern accommodation. Very friendly and helpful staff. Fabulius breakfast being the highlight. Wilk be back for sure.",5,2015,12,15
233,Excellent value boutque style hotel,"Just returned from a weekend in Dublin with the girls. Chose Ariel House for its location and good reviews. Didn't disappoint. The staff were friendly and gelpful, breakfast amazing, rooms spacious and tasteful, freebie cakes in afternoon - most welcome. Would have been outstanding if had a bar.
Other than that - excellent.",4,2015,12,09
233,Lovely stay in a warm friendly B and B,"Room excellent, wifi super throughout, staff friendly, breakfast wonderful.  Brilliant home from home whilst on business. The premises has an ambience that is full of personality and in stark contrast to many of the bland branded hotels.",5,2015,12,06
233,Awful night but offset by the day manager's professionalism,"I am making a point to write the full experience we had in Ariel House.  We booked it having read all the good reviews about the place.

Basically we had an awful night and thoroughly disappointed.  We were given a deluxe room which is big but full of old and tired furniture.  It also smelled musty.  The carpet is worn and looks dirty.  The bed bases could do with a cover to avoid the cheap look.  

The drama started when the sink plug got stuck the first time we used at 10:30pm.  The night manager came after two calls and 20 minutes later.  He said it was because I pushed it down.  When I asked him to explain the normal way to get it up, he said “push it down”!!!  He then returned with a knife trying to wedge it up.  After failing he offered us a much smaller room, with a double bed and a duvet too small for two people to share.  We dragged our suitcases up stairs then down again, at 11:45pm.  After testing the sink plug, we found out the heater didn't work.  Another night manager came to “help”.  He tried the room’s heater, first telling that I didn't know how to turn it on while he actually turned it from full strength to zero, then told us that the heater was now working when it was clearly stone cold.  At the end he said okay the heaters only came on at a certain time but he didn’t know when exactly.  He left us a portable heater.  We went to sleep around 1am only to wake up around 3am soaking in sweat because both heaters were in full blast.  

Even we booked for two nights, by the morning we were thoroughly fed up and decided to change hotel.  As it turned out, the day manager was very apologetic and couldn’t do enough for us.  We were offered another room and he also said they wouldn’t charge us for the previous night.  He invited us to take breakfast regardless.  However, we just wanted to leave and walked out at 8am.

I appreciate that many people found the hotel’s old-fashion style charming and enjoyable.  Unfortunately we just came from another hotel where the (stable-converted) house and their retro facilities were in period style but nevertheless in impeccable conditions.  In comparison Ariel House just felt worn and depressing, while 30% more expensive.  The narrow and uneven stairs and corridors were a pain when we had to change rooms from one room in one part of the basement to another part without direct access.   We also understand the breakfast was a key success factor which we didn't experience. 

After quitting the place, I read some of the bad reviews and found our experience concurring much. 
 
To summarise, the accommodation experience itself would get 1-star but the day manager’s professionalism would get 5-star so we gave it a 3-star.  But we would not be returning to Ariel House.",3,2015,11,29
233,Simply Fantastic,"I and my wife stayed in Ariel House Guesthouse in October 2015. We were celebrating our silver anniversary, 25 years of a happy marriage. Our stay was simply fantastic. The Guesthouse itself is very beautiful and cozy. The staff is extraordinarily helpful and thoughtful. Thanks you a lot, Mr. Eion, Mr. Thiago, Miss Ana and Miss Deirdre! We use to travel frequently and we can say it were the best breakfasts we had in years. We are not exaggerating. The hotel is also very well located. The Dart Station is literally 1 minute walk from Ariel House. OK, 2 minutes, my wife used to say I walk too fast! Dart connects you with the whole city. The first thing we did was get the Dart and visit the magnificent Howth. We arrived in the hotel about 1h pm. The first shot we got in Howth was 1:43h pm.",5,2015,11,28
233,Close to the train and friendly staff!,The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Were able to recommend some sights in Dublin and allowed us an early check-in. Had an early morning check-out so sadly missed the breakfast! The staff prepared us a breakfast to-go upon our 6am departure!,4,2015,11,28
233,Pleasant stay with a great breakfast,"Stayed here on a Friday night as we were going to a concert in the national concert hall. We checked in that evening and were offered tea, cakes and scones in the drawing room. There is free parking out the front but it is limited, we parked on the street but it is only free after 6 or 7pm and on Saturdays and Sundays. 
The room was nice, with a standard bathroom with a shower in the bath. 
The breakfast was probably the best part of the stay. The dining room is nicely decorated with a side board of fresh fruit, pastries, cereal, breads and cheese. The service was great, as we were immediately offered tea/coffee and fresh juices. The selection on the menu was fantastic with options of an Irish breakfast, salmon, poached eggs and lots more. They were presented really well. 
Overall a pleasant stay in a guesthouse with some character. ",4,2015,11,24
233,Great afternoon tea,"I went for afternoon tea with a friend of mine. Delicious food, many sweets and the china was so beautiful. Atmosphere is very pleasant and cosy and the service was really good. Every single person we dealt with was a delight. Would highly recommend!",5,2015,11,21
233,Lived up to expectations!!,"What a lovely hotel! Arrived here early to be greeted with complimentary tea and cakes whilst our room was made ready, a complimentary upgrade later and we were shown to our spacious room with four poster bed. Staff were friendly, attentive and breakfast was superb! Location is ideal if you prefer a quieter area with good transport links to town!",4,2015,11,16
233,Delighted by the high standard,"I was part of a hen party staying at Ariel House so had no notion of what the place would be like as it was selected for us. Getting off at Lansdowne DART station, the Ariel was very well signposted and easy to find. However, having had several years'  experience with ""quaint"" old Dublin buildings being anything but, the facade filled me with apprehension. I was sent downstairs through a maze of little hallways that had me fearing our room would be some damp and dreary basement nook. On the contrary, we were in fact at garden level with large windows - with beautifully thick curtains! - charming antique furniture, soft beds and a thoroughly modern bathroom with all the ""posh hotel"" trimmings (and excellent shower / water pressure)!  This was much better than I expected. And little did I know that the best was yet to come - BREAKFAST! As the 'early birds' of our group, my friend & I were able to enjoy the pampering experience of the dining room to the full. Top-notch polite staff (I had my coffee refilled more times than I could count), generous offerings on the menu, beautiful Nicholas Mosse pottery on the buffet and food that was perfectly cooked from fine ingredients. What a relief to find such a lovely central place to stay in Dublin, especially one in a building that has been kept to a high standard!  I highly recommend enjoying it for yourself.",5,2015,11,16
233,First class accommodation,"Warmly greeted on arrival and allocated a well proportioned, clean and spacious room.  Coffee/tea and cakes available all afternoon in the residents lounge was most welcome after a long drive from Larne. This is available to all guests every day - a nice little touch. Staff are most helpful, giving appropriate advice, booking restaurants and even providing a recipie for the delicious wheaten bread that was served at breakfast. Now this is where Ariel House really scores. Staff greet you to the dining room in their spotless, starched, white linen aprons. The breakfast is exquisite and is partial self service and waitress served. An extensive menu of cooked breakfasts is on offer. My only regret was that I wasn't staying longer to sample more of the range of breakfasts on offer. I cannot commend this hotel highly enough and will definitely be back. Thank you to all concerned.",5,2015,11,14
233,A great Dublin retreat,"Ariel house provided a really great place to tour Dublin from, it is located in a relatively quiet part of the city, yet still a doable walk into the city center, or a short bus ride away. Also, a very short, less than 10 minutes, walk away was a nice group of pubs and restaurants that seemed to be populated by mostly locals. The rooms were nice and spacious, very clean and nicely appointed. The breakfast was one of the best we had on our three week trip. All in all a very nice place from which to tour Dublin.",5,2015,11,12
233,Beautiful old fashioned house (In a good way) with a superb breakfast,"It was our second consecutive year visit in Dublin due to a Summit.
We chose Ariel House again without an hesitation.
The location was great for us, just a few minutes walk from the RDS (convention center).
It's located 2 minutes walk from the train station (DART), so it's quite easy to get to the center. 
If the weather is good, it will take around 30 minutes walk to get to the center.

When entering ""Ariel House"" you will feel in the guest room as if you were in a small gentlemen club with its wing piano, fireplace and comfy chairs and sofa, chatting about the lousy weather while drinking afternoon tea with some cakes on the side.

The breakfast there is not less than excellent with starters, perfect pastries, fresh juice, choices of poached eggs, French toast, Pancake stack and much more. 

The staff were extremely kind and helpful.

The room was neat and cozy, with a small but functional bathroom.

I strongly recommend it to be your base camp in Dublin. Cheers!",5,2015,11,12
233,Good choice,"Very, very friendly hotel and reception, great breakfast, not directly in the City but everything is in good reach and public Transportation around the corner. 

Had problems with a taxi reservation to the Airport for 5:20am in the morning which was unconvenient so double check with them if it will work.

Rooms are nice but could  need some refurbishment here and there. Still a very good atmosphere there and not that Standard 4* hotel you might be used to visit which all look the same.

WLAN did only work properly in off peak times, could be improved. VPN not possible. 

Still a five star because of atmosphere, service and price/value",5,2015,11,12
233,"Beautiful house, amazing breakfast ","We stayed at Ariel House for 3 nights, including Halloween night. The room was very nice, only the bathroom could be better. The breakfast is amazing, one of the best of Dublin. 20 minutes the walking distance from the center. Beautiful neighborhood. Very close to the Dart train station.",4,2015,11,11
233,Best. Place. Ever.,"My husband and I stayed at Ariel House for 5 nights (October 25 to 30) and loved everything about the place. 
It was an easy 30-minute walk from everywhere we wanted to go. 
Upon arrival, and every time we would come back from our day out, we were welcomed with a friendly greeting and were offered tea or coffee and home-made scones or cake. No matter what time of day or night, there was also someone at that front desk and they were extremely helpful and accommodating. 
Our room (250) was spacious and quiet and very clean.
The breakfasts were fantastic. Lots of choices and oh so delicious. 
We wanted to try the afternoon tea which was mentioned in the guest directory. Although it was a weekday, and afternoon tea is normally only prepared on weekends, the staff prepared it just for the two of us. It was absolutely wonderful. Lovely little sandwiches and pastries and goodies and tea - served on beautiful elegant china. We felt totally pampered and it was a lovely way to pass our last afternoon in Dublin.
If we ever return to Dublin, I am sure we will book at Ariel House again. I can't imagine a better experience. ",5,2015,11,08
233,Review,"Outstanding comfort and hospitality as always. Our home in Dublin away from home. Everything is easy, warm, and comfortable. Why stay anywhere else? Simply the best. Breakfast serves as two meals. Coffee and cakes all day. The drawing room is your living room. You can read or entertain there as well as in your own room. Deidre and Cecilia understand true hospitality.",5,2015,11,08
233,Ideal accommodation in a quiet but convenient part of Dublin,"Ideal location, just out of the main part of town, yet within walking distance of the buses, DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transport) or taxis to get you into the city within 15 minutes.  The bedrooms are very well appointed, the breakfast is exceptional, the staff are so friendly and helpful.",4,2015,11,05
233,Outside the city centre but close enough,Very friendly staff. Rooms were great. One of them did not have the most efficient lighting. The breakfast is good. If you stay upstairs you will need to climb stairs. It must be great to stay here if there is rugby or soccer on at Aviva stadium. ,4,2015,11,04
233,Few words needed,"We booked and stayed for 4 nights from the 29th October after reviewing the Ariel House on here. We were not disappointed. The rooms was spacious and spotless and very nicely furnished - breakfast was as good if not better than earlier reviews mention and what a selection! All the front of house staff were friendly and always helpful; a nice, touch having to leave for the airport at 05.15 was our take away breakfast already and waiting. Thanks to all at the Ariel House - we would not hesitate to stay again.",5,2015,11,03
233,"Great breakfast, great experience","Loved everything about this place. We flew in to Dublin for our honeymoon later than we expected and found Ariel House while sitting in the airport waiting for our luggage, just needing a place for the night. We couldn't have gotten luckier! The breakfast was delicious with many choices, the room was great with enough space for two and our bags, reasonable price, and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. We decided to stay for two more nights there and it was no problem. We may even go back for our last night in Ireland!",5,2015,11,02
233,The most helpful hotel in Dublin,"They couldn't do enough for us. I needed to send two boxes for a conference I was speaking at. I was able to post them to the hotel, now problem. The desk was busy, but they still helped me take my bags down the stairs. The food is amazing, they even make their own gluten free bread for those of us who miss out on the full Irish, I got to eat the same as my friend even though I'm gluten free. I even got a hug when I left. I just LOVE this place!",5,2015,11,01
233,Customer Service is perfect here!,"This was my second time staying here and I will always be a repeat customer. There is no way to stop in Dublin and not stay at Ariel House, customer service is spectacular. Thank you so much for the room you put us in and for always being so lovely and helpful.",5,2015,10,30
233,A great stay to end our tour of Ireland!,"We recently spent almost a month in Ireland traveling by train and bus.  We started and ended our trip in Dublin.  Our first few days we spent in a large hotel in the center of the main tourist area, and we wanted something a little quieter for the last several days of our trip.  We booked at the Ariel House largely based on reviews on this site.  When we first arrived on a quiet Sunday afternoon, I was a little concerned about our choice.  Expectations were very high, of course.  The area seemed maybe a bit too quiet and removed, we had some trouble finding food, and I immediately realized I had not booked the right room for us.  By the next day, however, all of my concerns had become positives.

First of all, the managers and other staff were extremely friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  They worked with us to get us into a room that better met our needs (and more!), helped us with directions, dinner recommendations, and even laundry.
We ended up loving the location and the multiple options for getting around.  When time and weather permitted it was just a beautiful walk on leafy streets to get to parks and museums.  The DART train station was a very short distance and conveniently got us to and from the center in no time at all, day or night.  There were also frequent convenience buses and affordable taxi service when needed.  During the work week, the area was bustling, and we enjoyed joining the locals at the few but wonderful small restaurants and pubs within about a 5 -10 minute walk.  Rugby was on one of our nights, and even that turned out to be a hoot, just people- watching out the window as they headed to the stadium next door.

The breakfast was exceptional as many have stated.  Best not to be in a rush though.  Service was outstanding, but this is not ""fast food"" being served  here.  Allow time to savor it!

We were very pleased with our decision to stay at the Ariel House and would not hesitate to return.  I do think it is important to note that not all rooms are the same.  I am guessing that most of those contributing the  glowing reviews probably had the larger rooms.  To avoid disappointment, I would suggest spending a little more and book one of those.",5,2015,10,29
233,Wonderful Irish Guest House,"We stayed at Ariel House twice during our recent European trip. Both stays were a positive experience. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, chief O'Neill's breakfasts were five star. Haven't found better anywhere. 

We were assigned a first floor bedroom for our initial stay. Some critics call it the basement.  It really is at ground level, although downstairs from the second floor reception area. The staff kindly helped deliver our bags. We found the room and bath clean and meeting our expectations for a highly rated, well managed guest house. Our second stay was in a second floor room, down the hall from the reception area, easy to access, again it was clean and very comfortable.

All the employees were well trained and very helpful with directions and dining recommendations. We liked the area, restaurants, pubs, and ease of access to the rail system. For those of you coming in after an overnight transatlantic flight there is is a very comfortable sitting room up front were you can rest and enjoy some tea and scones while waiting for check in .

We will be back again next fall.",5,2015,10,29
233,Great accommadations and location!,"We arrived at Ariel House after an overnight flight from New York and a day spent wandering around Dublin.  What a great location, close to Aviva Stadium and the Lansdowne Road station on the DART.  The breakfasts were amazing, we left the car and took the train into downtown Dublin, only 2 stops away. We highly recommend it!",5,2015,10,29
233,Great Stay!,"We arrived at Ariel House after an overnight flight from Atlanta, GA.  The staff was warm and welcoming with hot tea/coffee & pastries.  We were able to check into our room early which was a great perk.  While the Ariel House is located in Ballsbridge & in Dublin City Center it is a short ride on the DART which is a very short block from the B & B.  The rooms was comfortable, staff very welcoming & accommodating.  The inclusive breakfast was plentiful and tasty.  I highly recommend staying at Ariel House during your trip to Dublin.",5,2015,10,28
233,Great Stay!,"My wife and I, and my in-laws stayed for 2 nights at Ariel House.  Service was first class and very accommodating and helpful for all requests.  Breakfast was great and the rooms were comfortable and clean.  Really appreciate the friendliness and service, especially the welcoming tea!  Highly recommend.",5,2015,10,26
233,Outstanding ,"We visited Dublin for the first time and picked this guest house from Tripadvisor recommendations. What a win! Ideally situated close to the Aviva stadium and the Lansdowne Road DART station, and housed in a magnificent old building. The rooms were perfect and the breakfasts amazing. The staff were extremely attentive and we had a memorable stay. If returning to Dublin, I would not hesitate to book here again. ",5,2015,10,23
233,"Stop searching, pick this one.","My husband and I stayed for the first night of our honeymoon. We loved it so much, we booked a second night! We would have booked again when we came back to Dublin for our flight home, but they were full. Our room was charming (in a good way, not code for ""falling apart""), spacious, and clean. The bathrooms were immaculate, the beds were comfy, and the view was lovely, overlooking a garden. We were curious there were no air conditioner, until we quickly realized there is absolutely no need for an air conditioner in Ireland, even in July. We opened a window and the cool Irish air did the trick. We had prompt service when arriving at the Ariel House. They offered us tea/coffee and homemade cakes while we waited for our room (we were early). The staff was extremely courteous and helpful. I could not believe what all we got for the price!",5,2015,10,20
233,Book it!,"great place to stay - clean, friendly, helpful, staff and within walking distance to Dublin and train station. Wonderful, homemade-to-order breakfast are delicious - Quiet place to get away yet close enough to really enjoy Dublin",5,2015,10,19
233,Great Location,"You have this beautiful building in a great location and you want to turn it into a hotel, do you completely gut it and remodel the interior to accommodate the demands of a modern hotel or do you adapt the existing interior?  The owners have gone for the second option and on the whole it kind of works.  The furniture in my room was clearly dated and when you opened the wardrobe it sounded like opening a coffin in an old horror movie.  My room had a double and a single bed with a bedside cabinet stuffed between them, sadly this really didn't work.  I was in room 230 and you really want to look at the layout of the room.  That said the staff were excellent, polite, professional and extremely helpful.  The breakfast menu was first class with a wide selection of choice.  The hotel is situated literally a stones throw from the local DART station.  Bottom line - would I stay here again?...............YES.",4,2015,10,17
233,BREAKFAST,"Being a GROUP of seven people visiting Dublin we were unable to book rooms at this hotel due to its limited capacity. Nevertheless, we decided to have breakfast there during our stay, having read so much about its quality... It was really great! The staff was frienly and polite. The dishes well cooked and of great variety. It's not usual in modern hotels to order and be able to enjoy freshly prepared meals. The environment was luxurious and relaxing. And the biggest surprise was  the cost: only 11 euros per person!",5,2015,10,17
233,We will be Back!!,"We only had an overnight at this hotel before catching a flight in the morning.  What a shame!  The hotel and the garden is beautiful, the staff are delightful, and the neighborhood is a sanctuary in the heart of Dublin.  Afternoon tea and cake was wrapping up when we checked it in, but it sure looked delicious.  We are so disappointed in ourselves for not booking a few additional nights. We will definitely be back!",5,2015,10,17
233,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed here on two occasions for a total of 6 nights. The room had a double bed and a single bed, two chairs, a table, tv, and desk, and still had sufficient walking space in the rest of the room. The only drawback was the bathroom which was tiny.You had to move out of the way to open the door once inside. The shower was good and the toilet and sink appeared to be new. Our room was upstairs overlooking the garden and they brought our bags to the room for us as there was no elevator.There was a computer in the office we were able to use upon request. This hotel is located in a lovely area of Dublin and is well worth staying at.
The staff was as helpful as could be. There was always someone at the desk to answer questions and help with any needs. The breakfast was a cold buffet and hot meals that could be ordered as well. We tried a few of the hot meals and each one was equally good as the other. The wait staff was attentive and kind.  They even packed us breakfast and pastries on days we would have to leave before the 7:30 start time for hot meals. 
This hotel is located down the block from the Lansdowne DART station which made it very convenient to get to the center of town. The trains came fairly frequently as well. It is a quick walk to Ballsbridge where there are several restaurants and a few shops. In addition, it is located within walking distance to the Aviva Stadium. The taxi fare to the airport was 28 Euros.  I would highly recommend staying at this accommodation. It is a very good value for the price charged and the included breakfast was excellent.",5,2015,10,17
233,Charming Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Ariel House for 6 nights at the end of September.  We made our booking easily through email directly with the hotel.  This is a very charming hotel in an old Victorian mansion and the staff are so helpful.  Our superior double room was very comfortable on the second floor looking out over the garden.  Even though the hotel was quite busy, we heard no noise at night.  The bed was very comfortable.  Breakfast is the best.  Everything is freshly made and delicious. There are many choices on the menu and we were able to have a different breakfast every morning.  We liked the location.  It is a lovely neighborhood and there are several nice restaurants within a few blocks.  The Dart train is about a block away which will take you right into the center of Dublin in a few minutes.  Walking takes about 20-30 minutes.",5,2015,10,16
233,Beautiful!!!!,"What a wonderful jewel in Dublin!! We stumbled on the website for Ariel House and we are so happy we booked our last 3 days in Ireland with them. Beautiful setting, extremely helpful staff, great breakfast and just a wonderful experience. We originally booked a Superior Room but were upgraded to a spacious Junior Suite (228).  The breakfast is high end, very fresh and the portions are just right. ",5,2015,10,16
233,"Fantastic welcome, beautiful accomodation, great location","We had a wonderful stay in Ariel House in October 2015. It is a beautiful B&B, very comfortable and in a great location to see and do everything you would like in Dublin - especially if you are a rugby fan as it is literally a stone's throw from the Aviva Stadium. It is a great location as it has a suburban train (DART) stop 2 mins walk away, and it is a 20min walk or a short (and cheap!) taxi journey to the city centre. But what really stood out for us was the fantastic, warm Irish welcome. The owners and staff could not have been more friendly, accommodating and welcoming. I am Irish and I was so proud that I brought my 2 English friends to experience true Irish hospitality in Ariel House. Thank you very much for making our girly weekend very special. Irene.",5,2015,10,16
233,Lovely boutique hotel in Dublin,"We stayed for three nights. The hotel is in walking distance to shops and restaurants.
Wonderful service, clean, quiet and the perfect place to stay while in Dublin.
The breakfast is outstanding! There are cakes, cookies and tea in the afternoon in the large sitting room, complementary. We loved our stay there.",5,2015,10,14
233,"Great guest house, with a few caveats","My boyfriend and I were spending about 2 days in Dublin and chose Ariel house based on the myriad glowing reviews. We had a wonderful experience but I did want to set expectations, especially for those who were first time travelers as we were: 

PROS: 
- The price is right, and was much cheaper than other hotels in Dublin around the same time
- The afternoon tea and cakes were delicious and a welcome sight after traveling in that day 
- The breakfast, as others have mentioned, is wonderful 
- Staff was extremely helpful
- Room was spacious and quiet; we were on the second floor toward the back 
- Location (kind of) - right next to Aviva Stadium and Lansdowne St train stop. However, this leads me to the cons... 

CONS:
- Location (kind of). For first timers like us, we had no idea what to expect or how far this was from downtown. We quickly learned that ""downtown"" Dublin is actually quite small. The hotel is about a 20-30 minute walk from St Stephen's Green, and 3 train stops away from Trinity College. This is definitely not a deal breaker, especially given the quiet and serene location, but it IS something to be aware of if you are a first timer and want to be in the thick of it. A cab from around the St Stephens are was 8-9 euro. 
- As others have mentioned, the house is historic. There are no elevators, which definitely makes getting luggage up and down difficult especially if (like us) you brought large luggage. This may be especially pertinent to older travelers. e

Honestly, I tend to stay at chain hotels as I appreciate the consistency and service, but this small, independently run guest house made me glad I branched out. Definitely recommended if the relative distance from attractions doesn't bother you.",4,2015,10,12
233,A little disappointed,"I was booked here because the hotel I was booked in had a plumbing problem.   I was disappointed with the level of service,  there was no-one to help with my luggage when I arrived, and there a whole flight of stairs up to the entrance.  I am an older traveler with arthritis and it was not easy for me.   Same with leaving but at least another guest helped.   The desk clerk did help with my luggage going down to my room on the ground floor but then pointed to room's location and left.   The door lock was a little tricky,  it took me several minutes to figure it out.   The room itself was quite musty so by the next morning my nose was running and I was sneezing.   No help getting my bag back upstairs when I was leaving.  On the bright side the breakfast was wonderful.   Reception then next day was very helpful when I forgot my iPad and sent it to me at the airport by cab.   I think they are just understaffed, in terms of help with luggage,   But I am not sure how to explain the misty room.",3,2015,10,11
233,My home away from home in Dublin,"I attended a nursing conference in Dublin and arrived early morning, mid-week.  The staff were warm in their greeting; sent me for a delightful hot breakfast in the dining room while my room was being prepared. After the delicious breakfast, my room was ready for me to catch a quick nap after my long flight from the USA.  During the conference I had a presentation to give, and the staff kindly printed out my notes several times for me as it went through various revisions.  The staff in the breakfast area were so kind--I kept telling them they were spoiling me!  My room was clean and quiet.  The living room always had tea and coffee and sweet treats.  The staff were so helpful if I needed directions or help to navigate Dublin.  My husband joined me after 4 days and he enjoyed his stay there as well.  I would recommend and definitely return!",5,2015,10,10
233,Great visit at Ariel House,"Wonderful B and B! Staff was very accommodating and helpful. Breakfast was yummy and plentiful. Only complaint is you could hear people in the rooms above and next door.  good location, pretty neighborhood. Room was spacious, including the bathroom. We were in the bottom floor which tended to be a little dark. Could use better lighting in the room.",4,2015,10,09
233,Excellent stay,"First class accommodation and Irish hospitality as it should be.  Deirdre was a charm.

Arrived early (well before the room was ready) from the States, and we were able to have breakfast, coffee/tea and  store luggage with no problem, and come back later when the room was ready.  

Breakfast was delicious both days, a great spot in a quiet part of Dublin.  Walked all over the city, and their restaurant recommendations later in the evening were spot on.  Would highly recommend to friends.",5,2015,10,08
233,Gtreat place to stay in Dublin.,Our first trip to Dublin. Great place to stay. 2 blocks from the train so a quick 3 minute trip to downtown Dublin. Could not hear the train from the Ariel House either. I would definitely stay here next time. Greeting staff was tremendous. Breakfast was the best. Great atmosphere too.,5,2015,10,07
233,Dublin weekend.,"Stayed for 2 nights with friends. Friendly and helpful staff, beautiful hotel and good location. Breakfast lovely but small. Pancakes melt in the mouth. Would stay here again and recommend to friends. ",4,2015,10,07
233,A return visit to my favourite Dublin Hotel,"Lovely to be back. The welcome was as warm as ever, and despite it being a couple of years since my last visit, I was greeted by name on arrival which was a very nice touch. The room was comfortable, and the breakfasts are already legendary. All in all it has made me want to find another excuse to come to Dublin, just for the pleasure of staying here again!",5,2015,10,07
233,"Elegant, warm and high class feel","The Ariel House is absolutely amazing! It was rated well and that's why we chose it as our base for Dublin. We felt so well taken care of! They thought of everything. We had great communication with the staff and with the booking process. We traveled with our toddler and it was a very comfortable place to be as a family. Our friends were there with us along with their toddler and also loved it. We were able to socialize and catch up with our friends in the big drawing room from time to time. We stayed a total of 3 nights. I wish we could have stayed a whole week. We would definitely come back. The breakfast was unbelievable for the price we paid. Everything felt so classy and yet we fit in. The decor and set up is lovely. The front desk is there 24/7 and met all our needs, including dealing with our toddler and his milk supply, they have a small fridge where they stored whatever we needed. The location is perfect distance to anything and the light rail is about 2 min walk. We couldn't have found a better place. Thank you for making our stay so memorable and comfortable! One thing we regret is not booking their 'afternoon tea' earlier because it's all booked out since it's probably as tasty and elegant as the breakfasts.",5,2015,10,06
233,Beautiful  B&B,"Yes, our room was a bit small and some of the mock-Victorian furniture needed a bit of repair (e.g. handles on a couple of the drawers in the charming little desk were broken), but the charm of the place, the cozy atmosphere, and the comfortable, well-equipped bathroom with a big shower/tub combo more than made up for it.  The staff (who are on duty 24/7) are all first rate and the breakfast (served until 11 am) is really beyond compare, with a buffet as well as a full menu which you can mix and match.  The location is convenient as well, just a few minutes' walk from the Ballsbridge shopping area with some nice restaurants and a grocery store.  It's also just a half block from the Lansdowne Road DART (light rail) stop, so it's easy to  access the rest of Dublin with minimal difficulty.  Indeed, if you're going to be in town for more than a day or so, it's worth a trip out to the airport to get a Leap Visitor Card, which gives you unlimited access to all of Dublin's train and bus lines.

My only complaint was that the hypoallergenic foam pillows they give you by default are uncomfortably hard, but they'll provide nice soft feather pillows on request, so it's not a big deal.",5,2015,10,06
233,"Amazing, unforgettable ",One of the best places I have ever stayed staff could not do enough for us!! Very welcoming if I go back to Dublin this is where I hope to stay. The food was absolutely amazing 10/10. From home to home.,5,2015,10,06
233,The perfect B&B,"I could not have made a better choice.  Down the block from the Aviva Stadium and the DART, the townhouse is lovely and charming and kept very clean, with a fantastic location, walking distance to buses, shops, cafes, restaurants, supermarkets, Sandymount and its beach, the city center and more.  I also loved the neighborhood's quiet tree-lined streets and the numerous period buildings. Now to the staff:  What a great team of hard-working, friendly and helpful professionals, always at the ready to assist with any request.  My room:  Simple, clean and comfortable.  The breakfast: Outstanding continental (begins at 7:00 a.m.) and hot choices (begins at 7:30 a.m.).  Yogurt, stewed fruits, peanut butter, farmhouse cheeses, fresh breads and scones, toast, cereals, porridge, French Toast, fruit, pancakes, full Irish, eggs cooked your way and more.  Tea time:  It is beautiful, served in the salon from about 1:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. or so, with variety of tea, homemade cakes and scones, and fresh coffee.  Maps and tour brochures are available in the entryway, and there is a small office where one can use a computer and print out boarding passes etc..  A walk to wonderful Merrion Square takes only about 10 minutes.  From the airport, the #702 AirCoach will drop customers off in front of the Ballsbridge Hotel, a 5-minute walk to Ariel House, for only 8 euros.  I cannot wait to return.  Thank you again, Ariel House, for everything!",5,2015,10,04
233,Best Breakfast Ever,"We like to start each day with a big breakfast and the Ariel House offers incredible made-to-order breakfasts with too many options!  Although it is a bit of a walk (20-30 minutes) to St Stephen's Green, the quiet neighborhood in Ballsbridge offers many good restaurants (seafood, Thai, Italian, etc) and pubs just minutes away.  Rooms were cozy and well-maintained.",5,2015,10,02
233,Week in Dublin doing day trips,"My wife and I stayed at Ariel House for a week early in September.  This was the perfect spot for us.  Friendly staff.  Outstanding breakfasts.  Clean, comfortable room.  The location was perfect.  We enjoyed the quieter setting in Ballsbridge and the easy transportation in all directions.  The Cityscape on-off bus stop 14 is just two blocks away.  The DART commuter train stop is one block away and provides great access into the city, but even better for us it is a wonderful way to get to the fishing village of Howth to the north and down the coast to Dalkey, Bray and Greystones -- all of which we strongly recommend.  We bought the three-day train tickets and had a great time.The pubs and restaurants in Ballsbridge itself are just a five minute walk away.   In short, this was the perfect spot for us and we will definitely stay there whenever we are in Dublin.",5,2015,10,02
233,"Welcoming,friendly with great service","We arrived to a very warm greeting from the receptionist who showed us to the drawing room and offered us complementary tea and scones whilst we waited for our room key. When we were shown to our room it was a very large room with large sash Windows and a four poster bed. The room was huge as was the bathroom which was as large as some rooms we have stayed in over the years!

Breakfast was excellent with a wide choice of cooked options with very good service. 

The only small niggle was that because this was an old house the floorboards creak which unfortunately meant that when the people moved around above us at 5.30 am (presumably to catch an early flight) we heard every footstep. If you can ask for a top floor room to prevent this. 

Overall an excellent stay and we would recommend/return.",5,2015,10,02
233,Each Time Is Like Coming Home,"We were very fortunate to have once again been guests at Ariel House but, I must say the wonderful staff (in particular Deirdre, Eoin, Rose and her amazing catering staff) treat us with such warmth that it is always like visiting your very favourite family members and friends.
The words used to describe Ariel House are so accurate: outstanding service, long lasting memories, award winning breakfasts, charming Victorian townhouses. There really are not enough superlatives to describe this absolute gem.
Our sincere thanks to all staff at AH for making our time again with you in Dublin so very very enjoyable and special. It sure sets the B&B bar exceptionally high. We know we need to move on to visit and explore other countries but, AH keeps bringing us back!",5,2015,09,28
233,Very deserving of the best service award,"Just to be clear I didn't get a chance to stay here as planned last new year as they had a major heading/ hot water issue which meant I couldn't but I can still tell you all about the wonderful service I did receive. 
Firstly I booked really far in advance as part of a massive Europe tour culminating in Dublin at new year. As my original query was well ahead of their booking calendar and pricing the team at AH took my details, advised me that they would hold the room and get back to me. Honestly I thought I would have to chase them up but no true to their word they came through and we were all booked. Over the next month's I had the chance to correspond to most of the reservation/ front of house staff and they were all extremely patient, professional and friendly through all of my many questions and I was really confident of a memorable stay. Alas just before we left in November the awful news that they would have to close for repairs. Now in my mind this was all just one of those things that nobody can be blamed for and I was busy thinking of what to do when Ariel House went on to say that they were talking the trouble to find guests suitable alternative accommodation. I was absolutely gobsmacked by this gesture and having complete trust in their customer service I went with their replacement of The Schoolhouse without question, what great service I thought but it didn't so there either. I was even more stupefied when I arrived at The Schoolhouse to find that they had been instructed that the accommodation was being convered by Ariel House, I thought I was being Punk'd!! Seriously can you imagine getting service like that with nothing in return but a heck of a lot of good will and a bankable promise that we will get to stay here really soon. Thank you so much Ariel House you have totally restored my faith in customer service and true hospitality. ",5,2015,09,27
233,Perfect Dublin Boutique Hotel,"My sister and I stayed at the Ariel House on the nights of August 20-21, 2015.  Because we were so impressed with the hotel, we cancelled a subsequent stay at a competitor's hotel and stayed there again for two nights the following week.  Everything about this small hotel is perfect.  It is immaculately clean, impressively friendly, and only a block from the train.  The breakfasts are arguably the best in Ireland!  Stay here...but leave room for us.  We will be back!",5,2015,09,26
233,Excellent Small Hotel,"From the moment we arrived the staff were fantastic, very friendly and helpful. The tea and scones on arrival were delicious and very welcome as was the availability of tea and cake in the lovely lounge at all times of the day.
The hotel is spotlessly clean and very comfortable. Breakfast is superb, my husband loved his full Irish and I enjoyed the wide selection of fruits, pancakes and cakes. 
Our room was very nice although it would have been useful to have had a set of drawers instead of the small bedside table (there was plenty of room). 
The hotel is about 20mins walk from the city centre but we knew this beforehand and enjoy seeing the surrounding area. Buses and the DART are very close so city access is easy. 
We loved staying at the Ariel and would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2015,09,24
233,A lovely place to stay in Dublin,"Our family of 4 (2 adult children) stayed here for a couple of days summer 2014 while we visited Dublin.   While it was a little further from the city centre than expected, the room, breakfast and surroundings more than made up for it!  The neighbourhood was lovely with several very good restaurants nearby.  The rooms were small but charming (expected in a property like this) - we all slept very well.  The breakfast room was bright and welcoming in the morning and the food was excellent.  I will admit having all our laundry done for £10 was wonderful at that point in our trip!",4,2015,09,23
233,Delightful Dublin,"Charming! We had a wonderful stay, the staff is very attentive.  Breakfast was served in a lovely room and was a very good multi course meal.  It is a bit of a walk to downtown but close to the Dart train.",5,2015,09,21
233,Not as expected,"Having read all the reviews for this B&B and having read the profiles of the staff working here, I have to admit that I expected more from this place. The best I can say is that the staff are very friendly and the breakfast is awesome. We stayed in Room 225 (upstairs) and it is quiet. The rooms have very creaky floors (to be expected in a very old house) but the bathrooms are not well fitted out. The room was more basic than expected with very little storage space.",3,2015,09,21
233,Perfect Choice,I booked this hotel based on others reviews and am very happy I did.  I arrived on foot walking a short distance after taking the Aircoach from Dublin airport ..... 14 Euro return.  I had flown 20 hours so was happy to be shown to my room facing the back garden with a lovely double brass bed.   I very much enjoyed the complimentary afternoon tea and chatting with other guests from all over the world.  After a glass of wine in the drawing room sleep beckoned and I slept 12 hours without hearing a thing.  Breakfast was wonderful and my only negative comment is that I didn't get to stay longer.  As a solo traveller I felt safe and loved the area of Ballsbridge.,5,2015,09,19
233,Our favorite during 10 days in Ireland,"Our room was beautiful, bath newly renovated. Deirdre was so attentive, making us feel so welcome and cared for!  The entire staff at breakfast were very kind, pleasant, and the breakfast delicious, with many choices!  We used the public transportation to travel into Dublin, but also walked into Dublin as well. Lovely neighborhood.  Thank you again for a wonderful stay.  ""The McD's""",5,2015,09,17
233,Extraordinary hospitality! We had a wonderful stay.,"3 night stay in September(9/3).  The room was on the upper floor facing the back.  The room had been renovated and was very quiet. 

1) Got rooms ready for early checked in - not just our room, but all our relatives' rooms( total 7 rooms).
2) Served us tea and goodies in the dining room while waiting.
3) Offered 24hours laundry service for 10euro per bag - we were on the road for more than 3 weeks! Glad I checked the room binder. 
4) I didn't make afternoon tea reservation and wish was granted! It was delicious and enjoyable relaxed tea time. 
5) Outstanding breakfast. 

Thank you, Deirdre and the team.
From Betty Ng",5,2015,09,15
233,Amazing place!,"I loved Ariel House. It's a beautiful, quiet, tree-lined street about half a block from the train station and just two stops to Trinity College. My room was gorgeous, on the main floor, the molded ceilings had to be at least 12 feet high, and a majestic 4-poster bed. I felt like royalty. The en-suite bathroom was luxurious too, had a bathtub as well as a shower. Hot, hot water! And plenty of it.  And all that for a very reasonable price. It really beat staying in the noisy, crowded city center where the prices are 50% more (or even higher) and who knows what kind of accommodation it is. Just one thing I would caution the traveler. It is also half a block from Aviva Stadium, so when booking, if you want to avoid crowds and noise, check the stadium calendar for events. I think if there was a soccer match or concert there, then my experience might have been different. No fault of Ariel House, but as a solo female traveler, I had to consider that. The staff was never intrusive, but always aimed to please. I had to pick up a rental car on my last morning, too early for breakfast, and the concierge made sure I had coffee and pastries to take with me while I waited for my cab. They really take the extra step to make sure you are happy. Thanks for a wonderful stay!",5,2015,09,15
233,Wow wow wow,"This place is an absolute hidden gem, no words I can say will give this place justice. The staff are so helpful and will do everything they can to help in any way possible. The location is fantastic next to the train direct into the city centre for a couple of euro return. 

The breakfast is amazing once more the staff their were brill and accommodated us in every way possible. 

I really can't stress to you if you visit Dublin this the place to me, don't miss this treat especially the afternoon tea. ",5,2015,09,09
233,Not enough words to describe how beautiful.,"This place is an absolute true Irish gem. Everything from the immaculate housekeeping, to the waitress' lovely manner that couldn't do enough for you, to the Front of House who treat you like family and give so much information about the area, tailoring everything to suit your needs and where you want to go. 

Food

The breakfast was absolutely wonderful, with so many choices of cereals, cheese and crackers, jams, scones, pastries, toast and a menu of choices from salmon, full Irish breakfast to pancakes and maple syrup! There is definitely plenty to keep you full until tea time. It was a culinary delight to dine here every morning. They also put on an afternoon tea with a choice of cakes in the stunning drawing room, which is lovely and cosy to just relax in. 

The room

The room was so lovely and spacious, we stayed in a suite and I want to completely decorate my house to look like this. Luxury from floor to ceiling with lovely ornate furniture and a huge bed you could get lost in. The bathroom was lovely and clean with a bath/shower and some snugly dressing gowns.

Area

The area is great and out the way of the hustle and bustle, so a peaceful night sleep is guaranteed. It's located with a train station just a few yards away which we found really handy to hop on to and takes you to the centre of town. There are some lovely restaurants with just a five minute walk from the hotel that have won lots of awards and you can tell why if you go! Roly's Bistro and The Lobster Pot are definitely ones of recommendation. 

All in all, I would recommend Ariel House to anyone and I would love to come back. Everything has been exceptional from start to finish and everything in between, I could not find a fault if I tried to.

233,Wonderful seclusion,"Had a great two night at the Ariel Hotel . Great beds, very quiet location but an easy ride on the DART train into town. Appreciate the excellent breakfast and service. 
The AIR COACH stops two blocks away making the airport connection easy as well.",5,2015,09,05
233,Better than ever,"Have stayed in Ariel House occasionally over the past few years. Returned there last weekend for the rugby match and our experience was even better than the very high standards of the past. One bedside locker was missing when we arrived but it was sorted once reported. The staff are extremely pleasant and helpful. The breakfasts are the best. We came back after a poor game and the sausage rolls as well as the usual tea/coffee, scones and cakes were a real treat.
It is located in a nice part of Dublin. The pleasant walk to Stephens Green/Grafton Street takes about 30 mins but there is a Dart station nearby.
We look forward to returning soon. It is now our first choice for a short stay in Dublin.",5,2015,09,04
233,I can't thank the staff enough...,"First of all, let me open my review by saying that my father and I were basically nightmare customers. We did not make anything easy for the poor people here at the Ariel House, so it would have been perfectly reasonable should any one of our many whims and requests not be accommodated... and yet every single thing we asked for, the wonderful, lovely, brilliant Ariel House staff provided with a smile.

- Stay an extra few days at the height of the season? ""Of course, we'll find something for you."" 
- Carry and store all our many, many bags? ""No problem."" 
- Borrow an umbrella? ""Sure."" Borrow two umbrellas? ""Here you go."" 
- Show up not one, not two, but SEVEN HOURS EARLY for check in? ""We'll get your room ready right away, and would you like some breakfast while you wait?""

I could not be more grateful. And speaking of the breakfast, oh my god. It's worth the price of the room for the breakfast alone. Eggs, granola, brown bread, eggs, salmon, french toast... it was exactly that perfect morning meal that the Irish have honestly perfected. 

Thank you to the incredibly talented wait staff in the dining room, who always knew the second I needed my coffee filled. I don't know how the servers knew when to come to a table and when to leave the diners alone, but it was really remarkable watching them intuitively know to laugh and chat with the more sociable guests and leave shyer ones (like myself) to quietly sit in the corner. That is, until my plate was empty or my juice needed topping up! Love them, love this breakfast. 

To be fair and balanced, my few negatives: some of the door knobs were a little loose in the way old buildings get, and if you stay downstairs you may find elephants in your pipes every time you flush. But really, all in all, 5 stars.",5,2015,08,31
233,"Excellent location, room, breakfast and staff","The title says it all really. This is a lovely Victorian house 30 seconds walk from the Dart rail line. Rooms are spacious enough with comfy bed, tv and tea making facilities.  Breakfast was tasty and plentiful and staff were very friendly. ",5,2015,08,30
233,Breakfast!,"Hotel was nice - clearly it is in an old house, so rooms are smallish and not great soundproofing.  But, OMG the breakfast is amazing!!!  Best breakfast of our whole trip.  Eat a scone with the raspberry jam - you won't regret it!  Neighborhood is quiet, so if you want to be in the middle of the ""party zone"" this is not the place for you.  Staff was very friendly.",4,2015,08,30
233,"Elegant, convenient, helpful.","We enjoyed our two-night stay at the Ariel House in Dublin. Staff were eager to be of service, very good breakfast, very close to the Lansdowne stop on the DART, only 3 (?) stops from Temple Bar. The Aircoach bus (8 euros) from the airport will drop you at Ballsbridge Hotel,only a couple blocks away.",5,2015,08,30
233,Outstanding,"Stayed at Ariel house both last year and this year for the Dublin Horse Show.. I CANNOT stress how friendly and helpful the staff are here.  I had a 3 week old baby this year and they could not do enough for me.  The rooms are absolutely beautiful, the breakfast is second to none - Top Class - will Never stay anywhere else in Dublin, Ariel house is a trully beautiful place to stay",5,2015,08,30
233,Lovely rooms and great breakfasts.,"We had a huge room and bathroom. So nice to have a room with space to move around in.Also a four poster bed which was an added surprise.
The breakfasts were excellent and the staff very helpful and friendly. Would always stay here when visiting Dublin as easy access to the city on the Dart. Station only a few minutes walk away.",5,2015,08,30
233,"Ariel House, Dublin","So perfect! exactly what we needed after our flight from the US. Friendly, competent staff and very comfortable room. Great location in the Ballabridge section of Dublin. Delicious breakfast served in a lovely open room.",5,2015,08,28
233,Appalling but will give another chance,"I arrived late after 2 connecting flights for a business meeting and went to my room in the bowels of the building I dont think I have had such an dreadful room for a long time. If It was not late (11pm) i would have checked out. I even re-read the tripadvosor reviews to make sure i was in the same hotel.
Its a B&B with no oportunity to get anything to eat later. Night reception advised me to go for a walk to the nearby area and get a kabab!
Without doubt the main reception rooms are charming. the photgraphs of the rooms on the website are charming. Everyone who reviews loves the cakes and staff. 
I can only review on the basis of the dungeon-like room which i was told was provided to corporate guests because of their quiet. There seem to be two qualaties of ""standard rooms"" A colleague who arrived in the afternoon had a propper double bed and was happy. My room was dark with ineffective lighting (2 bedside tables with energy saving lights). The dark furniture did not help. The bed was 2 singles (single headboards) made up as a double so one slipped down the middle. the headboards banged against the wall, as if i was having a good time (sorry next door) everytime I turned over. The view was a tiny patch of lawn and a hedge. Because it was so hot i had to keep the curtains open to allow the air in.

Breakfast was sperfectly good. No issues there. 

I discussed all these points with the reception desk and to be fair they reacted as a good hotel should. Indeed beyond what many would. I repeat that my room was appalling, but others of the same level are not. I will give it another try simply because of the way they handled my disatisfaction. Well done.",1,2015,08,25
233,Ariel House is always 'home away from home',"I have reviewed Ariel House before and it's time to do it again.  
I have been staying at Ariel House since 2009 and come at least once a year.  It has become my “home-away-from-home”.  My accommodations have always been excellent.  Breakfast can’t be beaten, I will take breakfast at Ariel House over any large hotel’s breakfast any day.  The most important thing to me is that I feel at home any place that I stay.  Ariel House is that place.  The staff’s hospitality is excellent and their attention to detail and guest is amazing.  What’s the difference between Ariel House and a larger hotel? – well – for me it’s a sense of belonging and being a welcomed addition to the ‘house’ part.  
If you are considering either a B&B or a hotel – give Ariel House a consideration.  Oh – and by the way.  Location is excellent – Ballsbridge is lovely.  If you want to talk to city centre it’s only about 20 minutes.  The dart is a very short way and makes it easy to get out and explore.",5,2015,08,25
233,Wonderful 3-Night Stay in Balsbridge,"We loved the Ariel House.  From the minute we arrived (very early), Cecilia, Deirdre and company were super nice and went to great lengths to accommodate us.  We came very tired after flying overnight from Boston and San Francisco and the whole team jumped into action to get us rooms to nap as soon as they could.  We soon settled into our relatively large, well appointed rooms for a three night stay.  
There were 7 of us, all family - two couples and 3 singles spread over 3 triple rooms.  We paid €130 a night per room in July(!) via booking.com.  A great value for what was delivered.  
The breakfast offerings are marvelous.  From full Irish to America-style pancakes to porridge and everything in between, you could not want for more.
Ariel House is a 3-5 minute walk to the DART at Lansdowne Road and just 20 minutes to Merrion Square Park.  A cab (or Dublin now has Uber) will get you just about anywhere in about 10 minutes.  We didn’t have a car (you don’t need one), but they do have a small car park out front that fits about 6 cars and there’s parking on the street as well, if you want to pay.  One night, we ate close by at the Chop House and had drinks at Slattery’s Pub – two good choices for dinner and drink.  DART will get you to the heart of Dublin or you can go south to Dún Laoghaire or Dalkey if you want a more relaxed day out.  
Free wi-fi extended to the rooms and there is tea and sweets in the drawing room in the morning and afternoon, which is an excellent retreat to read the paper or plan your excursions for the day.  
If you desire to be close to the action, Ballsbridge may not be the right location for you, but if peace and quiet and a beautiful and charming Victorian house, just minutes away from the city center are on order, Ariel House is the perfect choice.",5,2015,08,21
233,Best by a long way! ,"I have stayed here several times now .. Very friendly staff , always a great welcome. Homemade biscuits and cake on arrival, great value and better than any hotel, right next to the AViva stadium and a short walk from the RDS, great restaurants nearby, Comfortable beds, lots of hot water. The very best breakfast you will get ...... Anywhere!  ",5,2015,08,20
233,"Quiet neighborhood, easy access to city center","Ariel House is a stately hotel, composed of three buildings.  It's located in Embassy Row and by the Aviva Stadium. It is a short walk to the train station.  Breakfast is served in a lovely room with a skylight and the food was outstanding (fluffy pancakes, creamy oatmeal porridge).  Tea is served in the afternoon in the front parlor, with scones and whatever baked treats they've made for the day.",5,2015,08,18
233,Just fabulous,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night last weekend.  I have to this is a real find and we will definitely be back.  We found all the staff  really friendly and professional.  The rooms are extremely spacious and well furnished.  The onsite parking is a bonus, the dart and the aviva stadium as really close by.  We walked into the centre of Dublin in 25 minutes. 
The best part of our stay I would have to say was the breakfast which was really one of the best we had.",5,2015,08,16
233,"Quaint, friendly and delightful","We stayed here for a two night break after reading the reviews on TA   It has totally lived up to the reviews. 

Breakfasts are amazing. Rooms a little dated but has everything that you would expect. 

I can see now why people give it a great review.  Every time I have tried to book it since it has been fully booked, thus reflecting the quality. ",4,2015,08,16
233,Nice B&B in a good location,Ariel  House  is  a  nice  B & B  located  in  a  quiet  area  close  to  good  public  transport  links. There  is  also  good  off  street  parking. Where  it  really  excels  though  is  with  its  excellent  breakfast  and  its  professional  and  friendly  staff.,5,2015,08,13
233,A Perfect small hotel in a Perfect location,"Booked 2 Family rooms for 1 night, and can honestly say we will be back !

Some might think its only a Guesthouse .. but it more a Boutique Hotel !

Both Rooms were quite large with large bathrooms.

Beds were as comfy as anything I had in a Premier Inn

Breakfast was the Jewel in the crown .. Served Breakfast (like in days gone-bye) 

A truly WONDERFUL experience",5,2015,08,13
233,Perfection!,"As a regular guest, I can only describe Ariel House as sheer perfection! Deirdre, Cecilia and Owen are the consummate hosts. Whether it is for sightseeing suggestions, recommendations for dining out, at one of the many excellent restaurants in the neighbourhood, or a friendly chat they are ready to assist. The support staff i.e. Reception, Dining Room and Housekeeping are courteous, friendly and professional.
     The house is located on the spectacularly tree lined Lansdowne Road. The DART Station is a one minute walk out the front door. There is on-site parking. It is the perfect location to explore Dublin by foot or by car. Breakfast is most wonderful! It is the perfect way to start your day off, to be well nourished and fortified for one's day on the town. In fact, Breakfast alone would be one reason to come back, again. Each afternoon there is complimentary tea and assorted cake's available in the Drawing Room. All these delicious treats are home baked. By the way, the Scones are sheer bliss! It is a great way to relax and unwind after a busy day.
     It is the epitome of team work that makes Ariel House a must visit and truly a Dublin Gem!!!",5,2015,08,12
233,Wonderful Hotel Experience in Dublin!!!,We stayed at Ariel House for 3 nights with our family of four and had a wonderful experience! The property is beautifully maintained and is in a great location (quick taxi or DART ride to city center). It's a great value for such a wonderful hotel. It was quiet and the staff were very professional and attentive. The breakfasts are fabulous! We were so spoiled when we left there. There are lots of little touches like the cakes and sweets available in the evenings in the front lounge. We would go back to Ariel House in a heartbeat and highly recommend it!,5,2015,08,09
233,Our favorite B&B of our trip!,"We stayed here for 2 nights, we wish it had been longer. The houses (there are actually 3 connected) are beautifully kept, clean, and comfortable.  Our rooms were downstairs so not much natural light, but somehow we didn't mind. We were our of our rooms most of the day anyway, and they were large and the beds were comfortable. We had two rooms next to each other as we were a family of four traveling with two teenage sons. Wifi was good in the main area and ok in the downstairs rooms...a bi spotty in the late evenings when I suppose everyone was on it.

We felt so welcomed immediately, shown to our rooms like we were visiting someone's home.  We were able to stop in the sitting room for complimentary tea and cake before heading into the city.

The breakfast room was beautiful and I had been looking forward to the breakfast throughout our trip - lots of B&Bs get great breakfast reviews but this one deserves every single accolade. Nice setting, great service and delicious food.

The train station (Lansdowne) is indeed on the corner, so convenient.  Be aware that, while we were there anyway, the ticket office isn't staffed so you need to use the automated machines. We had a chip and pin card, not sure what others it takes. Also, to go into the city, the platform you need is right there thru the turnstiles. We were concerned at first whether or not we were at the correct platform.  Not the nicest prettiest area near to the train station but we felt safe enough and it was a quick ride to Pearse and Connolly.

We very much recommend Ariel House!",5,2015,08,09
233,Still fab,"Spent another lovely stay in Ariel House. It is good to see somewhere maintaining it's standards in all areas. Room was a large, beds comfortable, lovely toiletries. Breakfast again was brilliant as was afternoon tea. Will definitely be back again. ",5,2015,08,07
233,Very convenient location,"The service was consistently lovely , caring and helpful. Although our room and bathroom were a little tired we had comfortable beds and slept well. The House is well located walking distance to shops and pubs and for us not far from the car rental business.  Overall most convenient and pleasant.",4,2015,08,05
233,"Delightful, welcoming hotel in a leafy setting","My husband and I spent two nights at Ariel House last week.  It absolutely lived up to its good reviews.  We were given the Oscar Wilde room, huge, nicely decorated, clean with a lovely outlook onto the back garden.  We had just flown in from Australia and were exhausted.  We did not hear a sound and slept very peacefully.  The breakfast choices were varied and delicious.

We also appreciated the complimentary afternoon tea and the staff were very warm, friendly and helpful.

It is within pleasant walking distance of the centre of Dublin and very close to pretty Sandymount village-all in all, an ideal place to stay in Dublin.",5,2015,08,05
233,Every need met,"We stayed four nights at Ariel House and could not have been more pleased with the accommodation, location and outstanding service. Our room was on the ground floor, facing the street but was incredibly quiet.  We had a very spacious room with a four poster king bed, two arm chairs and coffee table.  The room had lots of antique furniture and was just beautiful.  The bathroom was also big and spotlessly clean.  Water pressure was strong in both the shower and bath. Beautiful toiletries and soft fluffy towels.  
We could not speak highly enough of the staff, who were absolutely outstanding.  Nothing was too much trouble, including afternoon tea to room, luggage carry, taxi's, drying our hand washing etc, etc.
Breakfast each morning was a treat.  There was so much to choose from and everything was of the highest standard.  I loved the porridge with apple and cinnamon but there were about twenty other items to choose.
Afternoon tea of cake, scones and sandwiches is available for guests either in the beautiful sitting room or in your own room and is just another example of how this hotel goes the extra mile.
Wifi was excellent.
Could not praise this hotel any higher.",5,2015,08,04
233,B and B if you like that,"My first and last stay in a b-n-b. I'm just a full service hotel type of guy. This was a converted house in a residential area, duh. Near nothing without a cab or long walk. I guess Dublin doesn't need A/C so unscreened open windows did the trick. Only steep steps from the street to the room. The breakfast and tea was very nice indeed. No bar and no other meals. So if you want quaint and small and out of the way, stay here.",4,2015,08,04
233,"Beautiful Lodgings, Great Hospitality","My wife and I stayed here for only one night. We wish we'd been able to stay longer. The room was beautiful and very clean, the breakfast was terrific, the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, and the location is perfect. It's a short walk to the lovely Herbert Park and just a half block from the train stop. Highly recommended. ",5,2015,08,03
233,Perfect Accommodation in Dublin,"We flew into Glagow Airport late on Friday evening, and caught the Aircoach bus from outside the terminal to the Ballsbridge Hotel (stop 4 or 5 I think), then walked a quick 5minutes to the front dorr of Ariel House - it could not have been easier.

24 hour receptionist let us in and show us to our room, where we slept solidly in the very comfortable and huge bed. The room itslef was spacious and quiet with a massive bathroom.

Breakfast each morning is provided in the lovely dining room and was simply delicious. Choices of full hot/cold breakfast and buffet cheeses/breads/meats/fruit etc. 

The hotel is in a beautiful area, and a good 30min walk into town where the attractions are. We ate in local restaurants and pubs (plenty of choices within 10min walk) and cannot fault them either.

All in all, if you are staying in Dublin, stay here and you will not be dissappointed.",5,2015,08,03
233,Fabulous,"2nd stay at this hotel for 2 nights b&b with 1 afternoon tea. Olde world charm. Accommodation great - ground floor room for 3 adults, food excellent breakfast menu made to order, staff outstanding nothing was a problem.",5,2015,07,30
233,Great location,Stayed here recently for several nights.  The staff is wonderful-very friendly and welcoming.  The breakfast is fantastic.  The location is really perfect-near the rail and some local restaurants are within walking distance.  The property is older and shows its age but the accommodations remain comfortable and tidy.  We would stay here again,4,2015,07,29
233,"Great value, great location, authentic Irish experience ","My wife and I stayed at the Ariel House for a couple of days on our latest visit to Dublin from Canada. We arrived in mid-morning and the reception from the Ariel House staff was outstanding. They took our bags to the storeroom and expedited the cleaning of our room. They then sent us to the breakfast room which was amazing. Full Irish breakfasts, continental or tasty treats like scrambled eggs with smoked salmon were there to tempt the palate and satisfy any hunger. The soda bread and the brown toast are the best anywhere, anytime. By the time we finished breakfast, our room was available (many hours before the stated check-in time). 

The room is quaint, comfy and fully equipped. Of course, there's no elevator but the staff will take care of your luggage, which they did for us.

When we came back down, the staff were very helpful with maps and advice. We had booked the hop-on/hop-off tour bus and staff directed us to the nearest stop. 

We had a great visit to Dublin and the staff at the Ariel House definitely contributed to that experience. 

",4,2015,07,29
233,Outstanding Service,"The service and care for our family members was outstanding.  From the moment we walked through the doors (an hour before check-in), they did what they could to finish preparing our rooms, provided us with tea, answered continuous questions and made us feel extremely welcome!  As we needed to leave early on the morning of our departure, their staff went the extra mile by coming in earlier than normal to provide us with another of their superb breakfasts.  The staff at Ariel House went above and beyond and we would be remiss if we did not share our experience.",5,2015,07,26
233,Service Excellent,"We stayed here recently for a concert, room was basic and nice with an oldstyle decor. Bathroom was very clean and fresh, well stocked with good quality toiletries. We were late home that night so missed the breakfast the next morning but upon check out we were offered tea and scones in the drawing room, we were delighted as we had a long drive home, and we were all a bit hungry, we were given fresh juice, tea, fresh scones and jams which where delicious, but then to top it off out came the waiter with freshly made toasted bacon sandwiches!! This was above and beyond what we expected. The staff are friendly and very helpful, I would stay again the next time im up in Dublin and will recommend this giest house to anyone looking for comfort and good food!! ",5,2015,07,26
233,Good old fashion hospitality!,"I booked two rooms for my daughter and a group of her college class mates that had been training at sea for 45 days. When they got there they actually needed more rooms, which quickly the lady at the front helped do. The rooms were clean and charming. Once they were situated in their rooms once again the lady at the front desk helped find them fun safe entertainment for the evening. Next morning, breakfast was fabulous! 
Great place to stay and the hospitality is worth a million! And just to reassure you this is defiantly a great place to stay, I had 6 boys ranging from 20-24 years of age talking about how great the Ariel House was for a week after their stay. 

One more thing, its walking distance to the train, which is great!",5,2015,07,25
233,"Lovely character, friendly staff, vegan-friendly breakfast","We stayed three nights and enjoyed the Victorian-style spacey double room. The room was clean and comfortable. Staff was really helpful and offered to print us info on vegan and vegan-friendly restaurants around Dublin. The walk to city centre was not that bad after all... Breakfast was vegan-friendly, they have plant-milk with their lovely ""Orchard porridge"" and the veg breakfast (if ordered without the eggs) is vegan and really tummy-filling :) Really nice and romantic weekend getaway!",5,2015,07,24
233,Lovely BnB,Mother and daughter staying two nights in July 2015. Staff were wonderful and helped bring our bags in from the car on arrival and let us leave our car on the day we checked out since our flight wasn't until 10pm. 1-2 minute walk from the DART station which took us right into town for sightseeing. Lovely room. The only problem was the popularity of the BnB meant we had a 40 minute wait for a table for breakfast (Sunday morning) so had to take a takeaway bag with us in order to make the DART train. Staff were as helpful as possible though.,5,2015,07,23
233,Dublin Delight!,"Do not be put off by the location of Ariel House being so close to the soccer stadium. We were there when a match was being played and there was no noise to be heard. If anything, it was neat to see and feel the excitement. After the match, we sat on the patio of a small French restaurant a street or two over enjoying a glass of wine and watching the crowd disperse. Ariel House staff were lovely, they offered tea and pastry every afternoon which we enjoyed after a day of sightseeing. The morning breakfast was absolutely superb and to this day I am still trying to replicate their fabulous scones! Many thanks for a delightful Dublin stay!",5,2015,07,23
233,"A bit of a walk to the city center, but great!","We arrived early, but the staff accommodated us by safely storing our luggage and even taking them to our upstairs rooms when they became available.  They told us that it was only a ""15 minute walk"" to the city center where we could catch the Hop On-Hop Off bus and tour Dublin.  We are in our 70's, so the walk turned out to be more like 30 minutes.  We used Uber to return to the house that evening, and found that to be a good way to mitigate the distance.
The rooms were nothing special, but clean and well organized.  As with most Bed & Breakfasts, the showers were small and cramped.  However, the breakfasts were more than 5 stars!  We ate at many Bed & Breakfasts on our trip, but these were something special.  They even prepared a ""sack breakfast"" for us to take to the airport as we had an early flight.
We spent the last two days of our Ireland trip at the Ariel House, and it was a perfect place to end our trip with.",5,2015,07,22
233,Disappointing at best,"I booked a Superior Deluxe room almost four months in advance of our trip to Dublin based on the reviews and photos. Upon arrival, I was almost brought to tears at the state of our room. It had no table, only one chair and barely enough room to walk around the bed. The decorative cover on the edge of the bed was frayed and there certainly weren't any ""lovingly selected antiques"" in the room. 

I went to the receptionist and showed her the email confirmation of my reservation as well as the photos from their website as testament that the room we were put in was not up to snuff. Her immediate response was that they were booked full and no other rooms were available. However, she did call my room about 10 minutes later to explain that she had done some shuffling, and offered me a different room. This time, it did at least have a table, and more space to actually walk around the bed. However, it was still not what I would consider Superior Deluxe. It was average. And the window in this room wouldn't open all the way so it was stuffy and hot. In addition, there were only two, teeny tiny flat pillows to sleep on. 

Being so disappointed in the room, we decided to head to city center to make the most of our time in Dublin. We asked the receptionist to call a cab. After waiting more than 15 minutes, and watching multiple available cabs drive by the front, I went in and cancelled our request so I could simply hail one. 

On to our next day-we again went sight seeing in the morning and came back to our room mid afternoon to rest. It was past 2:30 pm and the room hadn't been made up yet. Around 4:00 pm, someone came in and woke up my fiance to ask if they could make up the room. He responded only that we would like more toilet paper as there weren't even facial tissues in the room. Unfortunately, that wasn't even left behind. 

About the restaurant-it wasn't anything special. It was simply, okay. They have a banquette in the sun room that's been ripped and taped up with duck tape. I can't believe it's ranked so highly.",3,2015,07,22
233,Good Overall Value,"We stayed in a standard room and that is what it was. Clean bed, full bathroom, some coffee amenities and that was pretty much it. You are situated in the basement and can hear the people in the room above you walking around. Overall wasn't very impressed with the room but also wasn't turned off by the room. It was a standard room and wasn't looking for too much special. 

What turns this place into a four star is the staff and the breakfast. The staff was very helpful during the entire stay. Very quick to help when you ask questions, helped plan out our sightseeing day and helped with taxis and buses. 

The best part of the stay was the breakfast. You get to order some hot food such as a traditional Irish breakfast or eggs and smoked salmon or classics like pancakes or French toast. On top of that you can to choose from the continental buffer. The buffet include pastries (scones and banana bread were very good), cereals, breads, yogurt and cheeses. Also included juice and coffee or tea. 

Overall great.

233,Highly Recommended!! ,"We booked Ariel House to stay for one night as as were going to the AC/DC concert in the Aviva. 
Due to road blocks in the area because of the concert we had a lot of trouble getting to Ariel House so we contacted them and they were so helpful, staying on the phone directing us to get as close as possible to them. We ended up having to park a few streets away, i was quite concerned about my car and if/when we had to pay but they told us not to worry and they would make sure my car was OK and they even offered to pay for the parking.
When we arrived at the Ariel House we were greeted by very friendly staff and were offered a cup of tea. We got our bags carried to our room. The room, including the bathroom was very clean with everything that we needed. 
The next morning when we went down for breakfast the staff  again were so helpful and friendly and the actual breakfast was amazing - i would nearly go back just for the breakfast!!
I have to say i have been treated better here than i have in other 'well known' hotels in Dublin. I hope i get the chance to stay here again and I highly recommend Ariel House to anyone. ",5,2015,07,18
233,Ariel House Dublin - home away from home,"Ariel House exceeded our expectations over and over again. We were greeted warmly having been delayed due to a flight cancellation. Without hesitation they credited us for the night we missed, had our room ready early for us to rest before we headed out to a full day in Dublin. Ariel House is about a 25 minute walk to the City Center through beautiful neighborhoods. It is a 2 minute walk to the DART which connects to the LUAS or you can travel to Howth a beautiful fishing village 1/2 hour north of Dublin. Each and every staff member we encountered could not have done more for us, letting us use their computer to book train tickets, storing food for a picnic in the kitchen fridge overnight, providing lots of suggestions of what to do, restaurants (ask about restaurants in Ballsbridge a 5 minute walk away), directions to places including a great wash and fold a few minutes' walk from Ariel House. And the breakfast - cold buffet and table service, as much as you could eat and delicious. Cake for snacking during the day in the parlour. The room was spacious, immaculately clean and very modern bathroom. Whatever awards this guest house has received are very well deserved. You can't go wrong!",5,2015,07,15
233,Wonderful Stay,"We stayed for 3 nights and had a wonderful time.  The staff here are wonderful, they answered all our questions and were really helpful.  The breakfast is unbelievable, really good food and service.  The room was clean and very spacious. Transportation is very close by.  The Irish people were so friendly and helpful.",5,2015,07,15
233,Best if you can spend some time at the hotel.,"My wife and I were in Dublin for 2.5 days at the end of a longer trip. It was our first time in Dublin; so we tried to see as much as we could in that short time. Because of that, we didn't take full advantage of what I think generates such great reviews for Ariel House. We were never at the hotel during the complimentary tea and cake time. We rushed out without taking full advantage of breakfast. But if you can take the time to enjoy the property, it's terrific. Located on a quiet  (except on a rugby weekend, I'm guessing) tree-covered street in a mostly residential neighborhood, but only half a block from the DART rail (and Aviva rugby stadium) and within 10 minutes walk of restaurants and pubs in Ballsbridge. There were a few mechanical issues with our room, but staff was quick to address them. Property is generally well-maintained. Staff is very courteous and helpful. Bottom line, if you have time for a more leisurely stay, this place is probably unbeatable. If you're going to be out from early till late, particularly in the city centre, using the hotel only as a home base, you might do better with a hotel in the St Stephen's Green area.",4,2015,07,10
233,Highly recommended,"We booked Ariel house for a Dublin weekend away seeing the river dance. I was a bit concerned it was too far away from the center and temple bar but the location was great. There was a train station 1 minute down the road which takes you into the center in 3 stops. 
From the airport to the hotel cost us €30. The staff were lovely, answered all our questions about the area and local bars and even went online to tell us train times. On arrival we were asked if we wanted the WIFI password, the WIFI was fast, not like some hotels were it is so slow you may as well use 3G. Our room was amazing! It was very spacious, very clear, comfortable bed and blackout curtains. The breakfast room was lovely, possibly the nicest silver service I have experienced and I highly recommend the full Irish. 

I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Dublin.",5,2015,07,08
233,Warm welcome and wonderful send-off,"It was so nice to be welcomed warmly and offered afternoon tea, upon our arrival in Dublin. The boutique hotel is in a great location.  Our rooms were very pleasant and comfortable. The breakfast choices were extraordinary and the wait staff was both warm and attentive. A delightful place thanks to the people who make it so.",5,2015,07,07
233,Excellent stay,"We stayed in a triple/family room for the ACDC concert on 1/07/15. The hotel could not be in a better location for any events at the Aviva. The staff were welcoming upon check in and the property had a lot of character. Our room was spacious and the beds were comfortable. Whilst our room did not have the breakfast included another of our travelling party did and said it was on the best they have had. Parking was free,  try and get down early if possible as the parking is quite tight!",5,2015,07,07
233,"Lovely, but too cold","I was forced to choose Ariel House as I couldn't find any affordable price for the long weekend at the end of May. I was a bit sceptical, as it was a guest house, and so I was even more positively surprised when we arrived. The site is two minutes walk from Landsdown Road Dart Station and the house is beautiful and very well mantained. The staff is kind and gentle, the breakfast is simply eccellent and the junior suites are really romantic. Only problem is: my room (James Joyce, number 131) was extremely cold. Heating off, while outside it was 5 degrees. I asked more than one time to turn it on, but there was no useful answer and it was impossible to take a shower or relax in the room without going freezing.",4,2015,07,07
233,1st Time in Dublin,"The Ariel House is a beautiful B&B located outside of Dublin.  The staff went above and beyond in helping with any of our requests.  The breakfasts were delicious.  The room was extremely clean and comfortable.  The location is very close to Aviva Stadium, but the walk into Dublin took at least 15 minutes.  I would definitely recommend this B&B to anyone.",4,2015,07,07
233,excellent place,stayed here for concert 3/7/15 and cannot say enough about it.from arrival we were treated like royalty .rooms gorgeous clean comfy breakfast brilliant plenty to choose from staff very mannerly both my wife and i will definitely use this place again thanks to ariel house,5,2015,07,05
233,Convenient location with car park!,"Our family of five stayed two nights in Ariel House.  It was a bit tough to find because streets in Dublin can change names from block to block.  The front car park was a bonus.  Rooms are lovely and quiet though bathrooms could use an update. Our shower leaked from the backside of the tub and puddled the floor each time we used it. As others have noted, the food is spectacular and the staff are very friendly and helpful.  We walked to the city center each day, a pleasant 10-minute stroll.  I would stay here again, though with the arena looming overhead, I would make sure there were no events taking place.  We were lucky!",4,2015,07,04
233,"Brilliant hotel, great staff!!!","Got a last minute deal at Ariel house as we were going to see AC/DC in Aviva Stadium, had a bit of trouble getting to the hotel  as there where road blocks because of the concert, contacted the hotel and they were so helpful, giving us directions and doing everything they could to get us to them!
Finally got to the hotel and had a lovely welcome, was even offered a cup of tea!
Staff in this hotel were brilliant, can't even explain how great they were, have never been treated like this  in any hotel I have stayed at.
We couldn't get a car park at the hotel as the road was blocked so parked a few streets away on the side of the road, which the hotel even offered to pay for!
Got our cases carried to our room by the staff and room was lovely, very clean and comfortable.
Bathroom was really nice and the shower was great!
Breakfast was amazing, I had smoked salmon with poached eggs which was so nice and my sister had bacon and pancakes with maple syrup, she loved it too, even got refills of apple juice and coffee!
Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and I hope to stay here next time I am in Dublin.
Highly recommend this hotel for anyone going to a concert at Aviva as it is a 2 minute walk from the stadium!

If you are going to a concert, leave early to try and avoid the road blocks!",5,2015,07,04
233,Love this place!,"The Irish breakfast was so good, all other hotels in Ireland have big shoes to fill.  The staff are so warm and welcoming. The rooms very comfortable with everything we needed.  It was a long flight from the states and we showed up tired and hungry.  The staff recommended a restaurant very close by within walking distance, which was a perfect place for these tired tourists. When we got back to the hotel, we fell into this very comfortable bed and slept hard. When we woke up and headed down for breakfast, I was completely blown away by the breakfast offered. Delicious fresh fruit to start with
 coffee and juice and a traditional Irish breakfast of poached eggs, black and white pudding, sausage, bacon, wonderful breads and pastries. That started our day of touring off right.  We were sad to leave and went to check into our next hotel but they did not have our reservation. We called the Ariel House back and they were able to fit us in for an additional night! The staff went above and beyond to accommodate us.  I highly recommend this hotel, conveniently located, excellent service, delicious food. Need I say more?",5,2015,07,02
233,Fine Irish hospitality,"This was our first stay here and we were pleasantly surprised by quiet location, old world charm yet modern facilities. Close enough to the city to get in easily, yet quite enough for a good nights sleep!
Breakfast is superb and what a choice. The Staff were all very friendly and helpful. They also have complimentary tea, coffee and cake in the afternoon. Just the thing after a day stomping around Dublin.",5,2015,06,29
233,Great Place to Stay,"We were warmly greeted after a long flight from the USA with tea, coffee and wonderful scones. The quiet location is in walking distance to the city center or you can take the Dart in. The stop is a half a block away. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The breakfast and service were absolutely super. The only recommendation I have is to put outdoor furniture in the garden area. Thank you Ariel House!",5,2015,06,25
233,Ariel House - An Excellent Local B&B,"The Ariel is an excellent place to stay while in Dublin, the best part is the fantastic breakfast, the best we had while in Ireland. The location is perfect, close to the best locations to visit plus an excellent staff!",5,2015,06,22
233,What a wonderful place to stay!,"My husband and I arrived from the west coast of the US exhausted after the long flight. We took the local airbus (and glad we did) to Ariel House, where we were greeted with kind hospitality and offered tea and scones. Both were delicious! Their scones are simply fabulous! We arrived early, considerably before check in time. But Deirdre, our wonderful hostess, made sure we were comfortable and a room was ready for us relatively quickly. Luckily for us, Deirdre upgraded our room from standard to superior, much to our delight and gratitude. I highly recommend a superior room. Overall I cannot say enough wonderful things about the staff and breakfasts we enjoyed at Aerial House. I had booked it for our first two and last night's stays in Dublin, and would do so again in a heartbeat! This place made us feel so at home with all their kindness and consideration. It's a wonderful place to stay!",5,2015,06,22
233,Very comfortable hotel,"We agree with the positive reviews seen here. Friendly and helpful staff, great breakfast, quiet neighborhood with good access into center city. Our only negative was the bed was smaller than I expected, which could be my fault for not checking  more carefully.",5,2015,06,22
233,We'll run boutique hotel serving a fantastic breakfast.,"We liked the location of this hotel as it is away from the centre but convenient for the DART train into town (€2). Our room was spacious (255) with a nice seating area overlooking Lansdowne Road, the bed was comfortable, however the pillows weren't very forgiving. Staff were very helpful and offered a good concierge service. Breakfast was excellent.",5,2015,06,21
233,Absolutely Wonderful!,"Ariel House is an absolutely wonderful place to stay while visiting Dublin. The house itself is both quiet and charming, clean and comfortable. It is in a good location for touring Dublin. The staff was amazing! They were friendly, professional, extremely accommodating, and really made us feel welcome. The food was delicious, and we are sorry that we couldn't stay longer.",5,2015,06,20
233,"Charming Hotel, great location","What an absolute pleasure to stay here, service was faultless, made to feel very welcome, rooms were charming & very comfortable. The full Irish breakfast was delicious. I could not fault this hotel in any way & will definitely be returning here.",5,2015,06,20
233,Excellent pace to stay if attending Aviva Stadium.,"Really enjoyed our trip to Dublin with the Tartan Army , the hotel is well situated with good transort links to the City, cannot fault the breakfast. afternoon tea and helpfull staff , rooms are good value ",5,2015,06,19
233,"Comfortable, quiet, welcoming, plenty of warm scones & tasty food","Hospitable & pleasant restful stay. Plenty of tasty food. My hungry adolescent son enjoyed 2 main breakfasts. Walked to central sights - Trinity College, Dublin Castle, St. Patrick's Cathedral, St. Stephen's Green that afternoon. The following morning, we were graciously allowed to leave our car rental as we walked to the National Gallery of Ireland & the National Museum of Archaelogy.",5,2015,06,19
233,OLD WORLD CHARM,"We stayed on 2 separate occasions and were equally impressed.  On arrival we were invited into the front sitting room for afternoon tea, delightful! We were given excellent advice from their friendly staff about attractions and caught the 'Dart' which is about 5 mins walk to City centre. After a good nights rest we awoke to a superb, made to order breakfast.  They also have parking on site.  Only downside is the numerous stairs at the entrance. Would highly recommend! ",5,2015,06,18
233,Great B&B that is just outside the city center,Ariel house staff was very nice and helpful.  Rooms were large and beautiful.  Bathroom size and shower were outstanding.  Breakfast was very good with many options.  Only drawback maybe that parking is limited.,5,2015,06,17
233,Outstanding!!,"I stayed at Ariel House with my sister and our niece for a total of 4 days in the beginning of June.  The reviews are correct about the service and amazing breakfast.  The staff could not do enough for us. We stayed in room 223 and the beds were so comfortable, the bathroom very room and the size of the room quite large.

The Dart station is about 1/2 block from Ariel House, which makes the location very convenient to travel to the City Center.

We stayed at 4 other Bed and Breakfasts throughout Ireland and the breakfast at Ariel House was second to none, freshly cooked to order.

I highly recommend Ariel House and hope everyone enjoys their stay in this lovely home away from home as I did. 
Elaine",5,2015,06,16
233,Fantastic stay!,"Never one for actually leaving reviews (just reading them!) I felt I had to leave a glowing one for Ariel House, it was fantastic. We stayed for two nights, but I didn't want to leave!
A bit dubious about the location and hotel at the start, as it's a bit out of the way of the city centre where I'd usually book, after seeing our room and our first night I was converted. It was the best nights sleep I've ever had in a hotel! We commented at reception how nice and quiet it was and were surprised to be told they were fully booked that weekend! 
The room itself was lovely, clean and spacious with everything you would possibly need. I think we had a junior suite as we had a seating area which was brilliant for relaxing after a long day of sightseeing.
The staff were so pleasant and helpful, we had trouble connecting to the wifi but the guys on reception worked their magic and had us sorted in no time. The staff in the breakfast room were lovely and so attentive. As for the breakfast itself, second to none! Extensive menu that catered for all, and so so delicious!!
In the end being a bit outside the city was no big issue, perhaps better. For us it was still within walking distance to many places, and there was a dart stop right beside the hotel.
Overall I could not fault this place at all, so good we've already looked into when we can go back!!",5,2015,06,15
233,Very guest oriented,"Very beautiful,comfortable place. Our room wasn't quite ready upon arrival.  They took us to the sitting room, brought some coffe and pastries. Gave us plenty of info about getting around Dublin (local train is down the block), showed us on map places we wanted to go.  Had to leave by 7 the next morning. They arranged an early breakfast and called for a cab to pick us up. Wished we could've stayed another night or two.",5,2015,06,14
233,What a Beautiful Breakfast Experience!,"Booked a Superior Room  for 4 nights, including breakfast using the Hotels Website. Emails prior to arriving were replied to promptly and good clear info given.

From the airport, we caught the Aircoach, route 702 which ultimately goes to Greystones. the stop is located outside the arrivals hall and down the escalators or lift and head towards the left. Cost is €8:50 per person. It runs hourly at 35 minutes past the hour.  Get off at Ballsbridge Hotel on Pembroke Road and its an easy walk to Ariel House.
Easy check in. I asked for and received a map and a recommendation for dinner. We were allocated Room 253, along the hallway, around a couple of bends and up the flight of stairs.  The room overlooks the back of the property. Its a basic room with a bed, bedside tables, small TV, iron and ironing board and coffee/tea making facilities. The free wifi is fast. There is one easy chair. The room is quiet and we slept well.
The ensuite is smallish with a shower over the bath, hand basin and wc. There a heated towel rack. Shower gels, soap and shampoo is provided. The shower is really loud. 
My idea of a superior room is different to the one we got, so perhaps this is my problem not Ariel House.

Complementary Afternoon tea of cake and coffee is provided in the lovely Drawing Room, with lovely bay windows and a fire, however, the couches and seats are uncomfortable and need to be resprung.

Breakfast is a stunning affair!  Everything about the Breakfast is fantastic and is the best advantage of staying at Ariel House. The lovely staff in the breakfast room are so accommodating, the array of food so tempting and the quality excellent. I particularly love the breakfast cooked to order. Over the 4 days we tried a lot from the extensive menu and all was terrific.

Ariel House is located on a leafy road in the suburb of Ballsbridge. There are plenty of restaurants and pubs within easy walking distance. Staff are excellent in giving advice. 
Also within an easy walk is the rail station of Lansdowne Road. Another definite advantage. Using the DART rail system is easy to get into town, but also further afield to Howth one day and Dalkey another.
 
We recommend staying at Ariel House because of the location, the breakfast, the fast wifi and the staff.  Not sure if we got what we paid for with the room though, hence the 'very good' rating'.",4,2015,06,11
233,"Great location, breakfast and hospitality","Our stay at Ariel House was outstanding.  After a delayed arrival, the staff did everything possible to accommodate us.  The breakfast was the best during our 2-week stay in Ireland.  The location is 1/2 block from the DART commuter railroad and only 4 stops from downtown Dublin.  Very convenient.  No rental car required while visiting Dublin.",5,2015,06,10
233,Outstanding breakfast!!,"My girlfriend and I booked a superior room for 2 nights at the end of May and thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The staff were friendly and very accommodating.
The rooms were very spacious and great value for money.
Though my favourite part of the stay had to be the breakfast - simply outstanding. If you don't do anything else you have to try this breakfast menu. Staff again were very attentive
Location wise it is only a 20 minute walk to the city centre though close to trains and buses
Small suggestion would be to update some of the carpet throughout the property as it is worn in parts. Though bar that a brilliant stay and would recommend to anyone!!",5,2015,06,06
233,Great guest house with superb breakfast,"Stayed here in family room and it was great. Room was very comfortable & spacious.
The house itself is beautiful. Every afternoon they offer tea/coffee & cakes in the drawing room which is lovely.
The breakfasts here are spectacularly good. A choice from either a buffet or from a menu where you can choose a starter & a main course!
Thoroughly recommended.",5,2015,06,05
233,"Friendly service, good location.","Stayed for three nights in May 2015. Fine accommodation with friendly and helpful staff. Good location. A half-hour walk from Grafton Street, but very near a Dart stop and only a 10-minute walk to the Ballsbridge area, which has some nice pubs and restaurants and is much less crowded and touristy than Grafton or the Temple area.",4,2015,06,02
233,Best Service Ever!,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Ariel House. It was a bit out of Dublin's town centre, but within a decent walking distance, and also near a quaint little neighbourhood of its own with restaurants. The service was AMAZING!!! Really made our time in Dublin. We arrived early in the morning after flying all day, thinking we'd just drop our bags before check-in time. But staff said our room was ready and we could go right in for a nap. They even gave us tea and cookies before going up! Also, I'd unknowingly booked a triple room, and they switched us to a double room and refunded the rate difference. The room itself was very nice, with a comfortable bed and spacious en-suite. Breakfast was wonderful - great service, in a lovely room, and delicious food, especially the home-baked scones.  Would definitely stay again there in Dublin!",5,2015,06,01
233,Top notch breakfast,"Beautiful hotel in a great location--easy hop to the city centre, and lots of parks and nice restaurants nearby in Ballsbridge.

There was a small confusion over our room keys on the first night, and the staff made it up to us by offering us free breakfast during our stay. How lucky were we! The breakfast is absolutely outstanding—a beautiful array of freshly cooked pastries and breads, lots of fruit and vegetarian options, and stunning food made to order.

Only downside: the TV was small.",5,2015,05,31
233,An excellent stay!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our experience at the Ariel House! Because we stayed 3 nights we were given free breakfasts each day and I enjoyed the porridge and coffee. The House is only a 5 minute walk from the train into City Centre and 5 minutes the other way to restaurants and pubs. The beds were very comfortable and we did not hear any street noises. Parking was a little tight, thus the reason we took the train into the city each day! Staff are marvelous and extremely helpful with directions and recommendations what to see in Dublin. Laundry service is available two blocks from the House and the service is one-day if you get your laundry to them early in the morning.",5,2015,05,29
233,True Irish hospitality,"We stayed in Ariel for 4 nights and I can't praise the staff highly enough. When we first arrived we bombarded them with various requests (including another room where we might practise the flute without disturbing other guests) and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast was superb and abundant. Tea and cake is also supplied in the afternoon if you have room!
The hotel is very convenient for town (we walked in, but the DART is close by) and there are plenty of eating places nearby.
The room was comfortable, though a little dark to read even with the bedside light.
Altogether we can recommend Ariel without hesitation.",4,2015,05,29
233,Sensational Stay!,"I was in Dublin for 10 days of business and -- lucky me -- was booked into the Ariel House. From the moment you arrive the staff takes the most incredible care of you. The rooms are beautiful. If there is a finer breakfast to be found in Dublin, I'd like to know about it. The lounge is super comfy, and you will not be there for less than three minutes without someone offering you tea or coffee. One my favorite foods in Ireland is the brown bread they serve with most meals. Ariel House has an especially delicious one. I mentioned how much I enjoyed theirs, and not only was I rewarded with the recipe but my own loaf to carry back to the States. The Ariel House has my highest recommendation as a ""home away from home"" and I will never stay anywhere else when I come to Dublin.",5,2015,05,28
233,Lovely hotel and very kind staff,"Firstly, let me explain the reason why I gave this 4 stars rather than 5. This was purely down to the tiredness of the room we stayed in. We were in 252 which was a reasonably sized room with antique style furniture. It was quiet and the beds were comfortable. However, this was billed as a ""superior"" double. It was plain (no pictures on the walls), the décor was tired - iron burn marks on the carpet, damp on the bathroom ceiling, no drawers large enough to put your clothes in, very small TV very low down as not wall-mounted and generally, a slightly dated and neglected feel. Could perhaps be dealt with by way of a make over.
Ok, on to the positives which are considerable and impressive.
The general feel of this period property is welcoming and sophisticated and the staff are superbly attentive and friendly. Breakfast is excellent and the waitresses first class.
The afternoon coffee and cake was most welcome and it is a great credit to how peaceful and homely this hotel is that at breakfast, we were surprised at the number of people as, noise wise, there was no indication that the hotel was well occupied.
The reception staff were helpful and always accommodating and the location of the hotel is excellent. Ballsbridge is lovely, leafy and blessed with a good range of pubs, restaurants and shops. The hotel is a stone's throw from the Dart station - about 7 minutes into the city centre.
Must recommend Roly's Bistro for a great meal and I liked Paddy Cullens pub for a good pint of Guinness and relaxed atmosphere.
Would most definitely recommend this as a good hotel to stay in but would hesitate to award the coveted 5 stars until the rooms are refreshed. Admittedly, we may have been unlucky.",4,2015,05,27
233,Lovely Experience,"My husband and I stayed here in April 2015. We arrived late afternoon, tired after a long day travelling, and were welcomed with warmth and the offer of a cup of tea and scones in the living room - all included. Our room was nice, beds comfortable and bathroom fine. Breakfast was an experience. The breakfast room is lovely, the staff extraordinary; friendly, experienced and incredible efficient. The selection and quality of everything on offer was out of this world. 

We came back a couple of days later for another two nights and enjoyed ourselves just as much the second time around.

Only two minor drawbacks, limited car parking and stairs - limit the amount of luggage you will be lugging around. Not suitable for people who find stairs difficult.",5,2015,05,26
233,An absolute gem,"The only negative  thing you can say about this place is that it is not closer to the city centre. This hotel is absolutely second to none. It is tastefully decorated, spotlessly clean and totally comfortable. 
The staff are welcoming, helpful and genuinely friendly.
Our room was perfect, beautifully appointed and clean and cosy.
The breakfasts at the Ariel are without doubt the best I have ever had whilst travelling, they are better than I  make myself as I do not have access to Irish White Pudding.
If you are visiting Dublin you cannot go wrong at the Ariel. ",5,2015,05,26
233,Things to know,"We stayed at multiple B&B's on our recent visit to Ireland. There were many positives  to all but room for improvement with several.. If you are looking for a small, intimate B&B, this is not for you.  This is a LARGE property , more like a hotel with 24/7 front desk assistance. I will say the desk staff were VERY welcoming and helpful. One can read a free daily copy of the Irish Times in the lobby, and there are free, same day prepared pastries available in the lobby in the afternoon , including scones and petit cakes of various flavors along with tea or coffee whenever guests request it.  Hubby and I enjoyed reading and just unwinding from the busyness of Dublin in the lobby area . The breakfast menu offered a wide range of selections . One chooses a starter AND an entree PLUS there is an included breakfast buffet of many types of fruits, cereals, yogurts, etc. The breakfast area, while lovely, had a very unflattering view , though, .of a rooftop from an apparent add on to the property. Interesting history on the story of how three families decided to merge to one property..Ask staff for the story. Only other complaint is that the carpeting in the room, hallway, stairwell and throughout the property is very old and dingy looking. It needs to be replaced. One might also note: this property is In a very safe area near many Embassies including the U.S. one BUT it is pretty far from attractions. They will hail a taxi for you to get around if you wish( we are walkers so we still walked everywhere) and even advance arrange taxi service for you if you need an early one to the airport. Change the carpeting and they'd get a 5.",4,2015,05,25
233,Should have stayed here whole time in Dublin!,"The hotel is extremely clean, the staff more than welcoming and they truly care about their guests. I was not feeling well the morning after our stay and was surprised to have tea and a croissant delivered to my room, no charge. Upon checkout the deek clerk asked after my health. Stayed here the last night of our trip, will be the only place I stay in Dublin from now on.",5,2015,05,23
233,Felt like home,"We had a fantastic 3 night stay @Ariel house. We were checked in and out with efficiency with staff on hand to provide tips of where to eat and what to do and call us a taxi. The breakfast is amazing as most other reviews have said-compliments to the chef definitely. The wait staff were also fantastic and worked with such grace and friendliness. The only negative is that it's out of Dublin city and I am sure on a hot day walking is fine but we got pretty cold weather so that posed a challenge however the train stop is just a couple minutes away and gets you to the city quick (we figured this out on arrival). My only tip is, if you coming from the airport it's better to take a taxi and it costs the same as a bus and then train (it did for us anyways). We took a taxi back to the airport. The added touch of afternoon tea with cookies and bite size cake was fantastic and yum, just what was needed after a cold, wet day.  ",5,2015,05,23
233,Excellent stay . . .,"We took the AirLink 747 downtown from Dublin Airport.  We asked some friendly folks to point out the connection to the Luas.   There was a stop across the street from the football stadium and walking distance from Ariel House.
The room was lovely with a nice view of the quaint street.  Food was excellent.  They were very accommodating to my wife's need for gluten free food.
We walked to restaurants most of the time . . . no problem.   The front office staff was helpful and friendly.  It was a pleasant stay in Dublin.",5,2015,05,22
233,"""Excellent Irish Hospitality""","We really enjoyed our stay here.
Irish hospitality at its best, Cecilia was most warm friendly and welcoming together with the tea coffee freshly made scones and cake offered to us on arrival.
Our room was comfortable and clean.... the bed with fresh white linen was just soooo comfortable, warm heaters (even a toasty warm towel heater). 
You will not be disappointed with your stay at Ariel House in Dublin.
",5,2015,05,22
233,"Ok, but not as good as the reviews make it look","We were two adults and two children staying in this hotel for one night. Apparently, there are only a couple of rooms in the hotel for 4 people, and ours was in the basement. The service was very good but the room seemed old, the furniture, the bathroom, the windows, the TV, everything seemed in need of an update. The next morning we had breakfast before we left and it was very good. Overall, we had a good experience, but we had the pleasure of staying at other hotels in Dublin that are better than this place.",4,2015,05,20
233,4 day in Dublin - ARIEL HOUSE,"The Ariel House is really great.
The location is really convenient (walking distance to the city center, easy to find, train nearby,…), the staff is helpful and nice, the hotel is clean, comfortable and beautiful. The breakfasts are great. It’s really a good place to stay for a few days and visit Dublin and its surrounding.",5,2015,05,18
233,A quiet comfortable retreat - with personality!,"Many reviewers have commented on the friendliness and helpfulness of the Ariel House staff - I agree - they go the extra mile to make guests feel relaxed and welcome.
The hotel is situated well away from the frenetic centre of Dublin, yet is extremely convenient to a DART station (3 minutes walk) and to many restaurants and pubs.  
The breakfasts are exceptional, a very wide choice of cooked food, a fabulous buffet, lovely breads and fruits (better than is available in many 5 star hotels).  The service at breakfast was efficient and professional - and delivered with a smile.  Complimentary tea, coffee and snacks are available all day in the drawing room.
We stayed in a superior room on the garden level.  It was spotlessly clean and comfortable.  We did not hear a sound from inside or outside the hotel - conducive to very good night's sleep.  (This is an old Victorian building and the bedroom furniture and décor fits with that style.)
This hotel is a lovely Dublin retreat.  (I don't consider it very suitable for toddlers or very young children who need 'running about' areas.)",5,2015,05,17
233,Love this hotel. ,Fabulous hotel in a great location beside the dart. I love staying here.  There's a great welcoming feeling in it.  Rooms are spotless and cosy.  The breakfast is amazing. Looking forward to my next visit in July. ,5,2015,05,17
233,"Beautiful People, Lovely House, Amazing Cuisine","My sister and I had the delightful privilege of staying at this wonderful, friendly comfortable house in Ballsbridge area of Dublin.  The staff are so friendly, helpful, polite, and encouraging.  We were kindly assisted by Deirdre, and we were given perfect advice in anything we asked.  Each person who worked at the lovely Ariel House went out of their way to be helpful and informative.  The lovely food service workers, I am uncertain of each one's name, were gifted and talented cooks.  Ariel House was our first experience with Ireland, and we were absolutely stunned by the delicious breads, scones, cheeses, butter, yogurt, fruit, granola cereals, artistic presentation of all food & drinks, as well as the flowers and decor.  Ballsbridge area is perhaps  quieter than City Center, and the neighborhood has many trees and friendly people also.  We were pleased to be able to return to Ariel House in the evening by the transportation-The Dart-subway, and we would not get lost as Ariel is close to Aviva Stadium.  I would love to stay at Ariel House again, and we hope to see the same people as well.  

Although Ariel House has stairs and not a lift, the staff were very kind to assist my sister and I with navigating the steps, and we were also pleased to be able to leave our luggage at Ariel House when we first arrived in Dublin and wished to explore the city prior to having the room ready.

To sum up, Ariel House and staff are like a breath of fresh air, and the experience was truly
positive.  

We were also able to learn about the four kinds of Irish cheese and get the recipe for the delicious Brown Bread.  It was most kind that the helpful, sweet  breakfast hostess shared this information with me;  I was highly impressed with the food as I also cook, and the food was prepared better than mine--therefore, I have been inspired!!  We also loved the bright, cheery windows and view from the breakfast room.

The educational pictures and graceful, peaceful sitting room with piano, was very soothing and welcoming, but overall, the amazing, friendly, vibrant staff at Ariel House are like the crown jewels!

I regret we could not have stayed at Ariel House longer--it is also one of Ireland's treasures!",5,2015,05,13
233,Lovely Hotel - Great Location,"I have been to Dublin many times and this was the first time staying in the Ballsbridge Area.  Ariel House is a lovely Victorian brick house in a beautiful, tree-lined, Dublin neighborhood.  It is perfect for the vacationer who does not want the craziness of being in City Center, needs parking and easy access to City Center.  The Dart (subway) is 1/2 a block from the hotel, right in front of Aviva Stadium.  Round trip is about 2 Euros or $3.00, and only two brief stops, brings you behind Trinity College, and a better option than a cab.  

Ariel House itself is beautifully decorated.  We had our 12 year old daughter and needed he Family room, which was a good size (double and a twin).  Each day they serve a delicious Irish Breakfast and, in the afternoon,  a delightful tea with fresh lemonade, tea and home-made cake and cookies.  It was a joy to come back from a busy day touring the city to have a cup of tea and sweets!  I would highly recommend Ariel House to anyone who needs a quieter stay, doesn't want to be in the middle of City Center.  Ballsbridge is also a vibrant neighborhood filled with bars and restaurants. The staff is happy to suggest local restaurants and make reservations (you are in Europe, and need reservations during the evenings in most cities there).",4,2015,05,09
233,"""First Class""","This was my sixth stay at Ariel House. Everything is first class- a clean, comfortable  and inviting room, outstanding breakfasts, and exceptional service. Deirdre, Cecilia and staff could not have been better hosts. Spotless facility and gourment breakfast each morning. Perfect location to explore Dublin by foot or car.
If you are searching for a top-notch Inn within comfortable walking distance to many points in Dublin, you don't need to look any further! Ariel House will always be my first choice to stay when in Dublin.",5,2015,05,06
233,Excellent again,stayed for one night with my mum. this is my second time. i really wish i could remember the young mans name that works there. so helpful last saturday..the room was lovely and comfortable. great sleep. the breakfast beautiful. the staff so welcoming. nice to treat my mum.will stay again soon i hope.,5,2015,05,01
233,"""Fabulous""","Stayed here for a weekend break, from 24th-26th April for our wedding anniversary. From the time we arrived, we were extremely well looked after. Cecilia (guest relations manager) made us feel very welcome, and introduced us to Deirdre (G.M.) who also welcomed us warmly. Cecilia showed us to our room, which was a large double room looking out onto beautiful gardens. A Complimentary bottle of wine was there, as was a personalised letter from Deirdre, welcoming us to Ariel House. The room/bathroom were lovely. Ariel house is very close to public transport and we were in the city centre within  10-15 minutes of leaving the hotel.  Now to the breakfast, a buffet with all you could want, with a menu to order your hot breakfast. I had the full irish the first day which came out piping hot and very fresh, lovely, and the pancakes and bacon the second day, piping hot again, pancakes (freshly made on the premises) light as a feather, gorgeous!!! Staff on breakfast were also excellent, very attentive and friendly. Couldn't recommend Ariel House highly enough, and will hopefully have the opportunity to stay there again in the future.",5,2015,04,29
233,First Visit to Ireland,"My wife and I spent six nights at the Ariel House in mid-April during our first visit to Ireland. It's a pleasant 20 minute or so stroll into the city centre but the DART is right there is you prefer not to walk, The staff was uniformly excellent starting before the trip advising about getting to the hotel from the airport (the Air Coach worked as described) and giving advice re nearby restaurants and location for traditional Irish music (the Cobblestone Pub near Jameson's was a special treat). Ditto for the breakfast servers and the breakfast itself. They also provided a takeaway breakfast for us when we had an early tour to the Cliffs of Moher.
It was nice to be away from the hustle and bustle of downtown. The room was quiet and the bed was very comfortable. It would have been nice to have bathrobes but that is something you really don't expect.
This trip whetted our appetitie for Irealnd and we expect to return - we look forward to a return stay at the Ariel House!",5,2015,04,28
233,Centre of Dublin Gem,"Recently stayed here for a short trip to Dublin. The hotel is situated about 3 minutes walk away from the DART station. You can look out of the window an see the AVIVA Stadium shining down over you.

The property is a Victorian house with all modern amenities, the plumbing is sometimes a little noisy however this is expected from an old house. The staff were kind and courteous and full of suggestions to absorb the local culture. The property was nice and clean and showed it was cared for. 

Unfortunately due to our short stay we didn't get a chance to sample breakfast. However the selection of complimentary cakes in the drawing room were amazing.",4,2015,04,27
233,superlative breakfast,"But breakfast is only the beginning.  This small hotel is like a large B and B, very warm and welcoming with tea and coffee flowing in the afternoon hours.  I was up very early in the drawing room reading my first morning and someone coming on duty at 6am immediately offered me coffee.  We were there our first 3 nights of our 18 day Ireland tour and our last 3 nights.  It was so nice to round out the tour at this comfortable spot.",5,2015,04,26
233,Best Dublin Guesthouse,"Having stayed here numerous times, I decided after my latest stay that I had to leave a review. I booked here for an anniversary celebration, for one night and afternoon tea. I mentioned when booking that it was a surprise celebration for an anniversary when I arrived, I realised we had been upgraded to an incredible suite. Afternoon tea was amazing, unlike other places, it doesn't all come out at once. The sandwiches come out first followed by the sweets and desserts and there's plenty to start off with, but they also offer more if you want it. The breakfast in Ariel House is second to none, freshly cooked to order and plenty of choice at the continental table as well. The staff are exceptional and you're never left wanting for anything. I would recommend it anyone, particularly if you're looking for something special or a taste of luxury.",5,2015,04,21
233,"Absolutely Brilliant - Ariel House, Dublin","I had the pleasure of staying here recently. The Hotel can be reached from Dublin Airport by the Air Coach Service, its a very simple journey costing around 9 Euros per person. We stayed in one of the lower double rooms, everything was spotlessly clean and the welcome was fantastic. Ariel House is actually an old merchants home, it now spans several floors. The location is excellent. Its very close to Lansdowne Road Train station and the new Rugby Stadium. There is a short but easy walk into central dublin, maybe 25 minutes but its a great walk. Or alternatively you can walk around the corner to catch a number 7 or 4 bus and its literally 5 minutes. The beauty of staying here is that you are in a nice residential area instead of the main busy shopping centre. the staff were great and the food was really fantastic, I could not fault this place.",5,2015,04,21
233,Quirky and Delightful,"We stayed at the Ariel House for our last night in Ireland and our only night in Dublin. I really liked that it was old Victorian house, with its big front room, where I think they serve afternoon tea, its winding hallways and stairs, the enormously high ceilings, and the architectural details.  That spaceship of a stadium is really just down the block, but you wouldn't know it while at the Ariel House. Outside, the juxtaposition of the stadium with the row of Victorian houses makes for a surreal image. The breakfast, my measure for what is important, was outstanding. I love it when the hot breakfast, which we ordered from the menu, is just the right size. To me that means the focus is on quality, not quantity, which it certainly was. And do not overlook the scones, the tastiest I had in all of Ireland.",5,2015,04,20
233,Very nice location - Excellent staff!,"Good location if you don't mind walking. Easy access to transit and hop-on hop-off buses. Nice neighbourhood.
The staff is outstanding. Super nice and helpful.
Rooms are a little dated, But not a deal breaker, besides this is an old house!",4,2015,04,16
233,Wonderful stay,"We looked long and hard for the ""right"" location for our two night stay in Dublin.  Ariel House is located in a quite neighborhood in the south of Dublin, 150 meters from a train station or a short 20 minute walk to the downtown area.  The building and rooms are charming, the staff extremely helpful, and food excellent.  The full Irish breakfast, fresh breads, and local cheese were hard to step away from. Don't miss out on the afternoon scones.",5,2015,04,15
233,Excellent experience,"It was our first time in Ireland, and we were a bit surprised by all the kindness of the staff. We stayed there for two nights. The staff was very professionnel, always helpful. We got a baby cot as booked. The room was a bit small, but very neat, clean and with a bathtub. Excellent breakfast as well.",5,2015,04,15
233,Wonderful stay!,"Stayed in this gem of a place for one night only, unfortunately, but it was a great find! Friendly, helpful staff, great room with lovely period furniture and four poster bed and to top it off the best breakfast I've had in any Irish hotel, such a choice! Would put a lot of the bigger hotels to shame. Will definitely be back!",5,2015,04,14
233,Excellent hotel. Lovely staff. Great location and beautiful hotel with big rooms.,"We stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel is lovely. Large Victorian property. 15 minutes walk from the centre of Dublin in a quiet area. Hotel room very large (standard ensuite) with lovely bathroom. Breakfast had everything. Staff were lovely and very willing to help. Breakfast staff were very attentive.  Wonderful lounge . In the afternoon complimentary cakes and rea/coffee are served. This is a nice touch.
If we visit Dublin again we will only stay here.
Excellent all round.",5,2015,04,14
233,Simply the best!,"We have just stayed here for a week during Easter and enjoyed the unique Ariel House service & hospitality once more. Superb attention to detail, great customer service, fab breakfast makes this Simply the Best.",5,2015,04,11
233,Fantastic guest house with very high  standards,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights   We found the location ideal it's only a minute from the Dart rail service and a twenty minute walk to the city .The area is a very pleasant suburb of Dublin plenty of Good restaurants  nearby ,our favourite was the Chophouse great steaks and service 
The breakfasts were among the best I have ever had all freshly cooked and plenty of choice served by very friendly staff We loved the tea and cakes provided free in the afternoons 
The staff make this one of the best places to stay in Dublin  We will always stay here on our visits to Dublin",5,2015,04,11
233,A little out of the way but a great stay,"We were fortunate enough to have gotten an upgrade to the William Butler Yeats Suite - and it was marvelous! Super large room with a canopy bed and a super large bathroom to go with it, including a very roomy bathtub and separate shower stall. 
It is a little out of the way, but the DART station is extremely close and convenient for getting to the heart of the city, although we did walk several times as well. We enjoy walking so it wasn't a bother. Nice neighborhood area with good restaurants near by. 
Lovely staff, so friendly and helpful. Jessica, the girl who checked us in, was so sweet and Deirdre was so helpful with information and getting us set up for our visit to the Guinness Store House. I was sick one day with a bad cold and stayed in so the front desk man helped my husband find a restaurant for take out and supplied us with plates and  utensils.
Breakfast is also quite good so don't miss it - we had several delicious meals cooked to order.",5,2015,04,10
233,Great improvement ,"I used to stay here a lot about 7 years ago, however I returned on business last weekend. I was impressed by the improvements. The room was amazing and staff very friendly. I requested a late check out, which I didn't need in the end, there was no problem. The only down side is the parking. ",5,2015,04,09
233,Lovely find in leafy Lansdowne ,Stayed recently for one night with my boyfriend and we were both very pleased with our stay. The quaint homely feel of the Ariel house is something to be commended as is the superb breakfast offered. It is clearly evident that the quality of food is of high priority and I hope this continues. Another lovely touch is the complimentary tea coffee and homemade scones and breads that are available in the drawing room for guests. Has very much a home from home feeling. Bedrooms are spacious and the decor compliments the overall theme of the house.I will definitely visit in the future and will recommend to others staying in Dublin. Keep up the great work and unique style. ,5,2015,04,08
233,Charming and thoughtful,We stayed here for two nights over the Easter weekend as we had come to watch the rugby.  Ariel House is ideally situated for the Aviva Stadium.  Whilst the corridors and bedroom were looking a little tired in places it added to the charm of the place and the main lounge and dining room were both lovely environments in which to spend time.  The breakfasts were truly excellent in terms of choice and quality and there was a lovely touch of a beautiful Easter egg for each couple on Easter Sunday.  Would highly recommend and we would return if we go back to Dublin again.,5,2015,04,08
233,"Great rooms, lovely atmosphere, delicious breakfast",Stayed at Ariel House for two nights. The building is a traditional British brick house and the interior is kept beautifully. Piano and complementary cake in the living room. An amazing and delicious breakfast served every morning to order. Rooms were clean and nice. Has the feel of a B&B with the service of a traditional hotel. Free parking. 25 minutes walk to downtown. Would recommend.,5,2015,04,07
233,Amazing breakfast,"We stayed in one of the rooms downstairs, however it had a large window facing the parking which allow lots of natural light to come in into the room so although it was in the basement it was not a dark room at all. The area is very quite during both the day and at night and the beds were very comfortable so we have a good rest every night. The room was very big, warm and clean. 
The breakfast is included with the room and it was probably the best breakfast I have eaten in my entire life. There was a buffet with cereals, cheese board, yogurt, pastries... and all the usual things; however, in addition we were offered a selection between full Irish breakfast, poached eggs with salmon, delicious pancakes and more options I can't remember. Everything was totally delicious and the staff was very nice and helpful.
The only issue we had in this hotel was a problem with the hot water in our room the first night; however the staff of the hotel solved the problem early next morning and refund us the price of that night for the inconvenience as their own initiative so we were delighted with our experience in this hotel.
If we returned to Dublin we would certainly try to book again in this hotel as the staff is very helpful, the rooms are comfy and clean, the breakfast is amazing and it is only placed 2 train stops (about 10min) from the city center.",5,2015,04,07
233,Absolutley fantastic,We booked this at last minute in November 2014 from  Paris on our 1 month European trip. The staff could not help us enough and the rooms were superb. And the price was well within our budget and outdid our expectations,5,2015,03,31
233,Up with the best,"Although our visit to Ariel house was short we had a very enjoyable stay. The staff were very friendly and really helpful throughout. The room was lovely, warm and clean. Breakfast was excellent and set us up for our trip back home. Thanks very much again to the staff for a lovely stay.",5,2015,03,28
233,Dublin's best,"Spent 8 wonderful days at Ariel House this March. Rooms are large, comfortably furnished with high ceilings and large full baths. Beds are superb. This is a grand mansion with extremely extremely good ventilation and fresh air. Breakfasts are gourmet quality. Deidre and Cecili give real meaning to the word Hospitality. They really care about each guest and their comfort. So does the rest of the staff. I actually felt like I was at home. I can't imagine staying any where else in Dublin and look forward to my return.",5,2015,03,27
233,Most lovely experience,"I returned to Ariel House after having had a perfect stay back in August, and once again everything was lovely. The staff, the breakfast, the afternoon tea, all of it makes me want to return right away. I really could not recommend Ariel House more, it's a must if you're looking for a relaxing, comfortable place to stay in Dublin. ",5,2015,03,27
233,One of the best parts of the trip!,"A friend and I (both students, both first-time international travellers) stayed here and were so glad we did. Because of their breakfast, tea, and patient advice we had a great experience in Dublin and were sorry to leave. Being a little out of the city center was actually a plus-- going back every night was easy and even relaxing.",5,2015,03,25
233,Super staff,"The staff couldn't be any more helpful. The room was wonderful and the breakfast great. There was nothing you could be unhappy with.  Eoin was most helpful with directions for restaurants and the train usage. The location was excellent, close to everything.",5,2015,03,24
233,excellent stay,"Nothing was too much trouble all the staff where friendly the breakfast awesome, and so many nice touches from the shamrock and the first day cover stamp left in our bedroom to celebrate St Patrick's day to the coffee and cakes in the drawing room,The room was very spacious and comfortable.",5,2015,03,20
233,Awesome value,This is a quiet and quaint experience that is only a few minutes on the train away from Dublins city centre. Spacious rooms with awesome bathrooms. Great location for rugby lovers. Well priced and worth a stay.,4,2015,03,18
233,Girly night away,"Myself and my friend stayed here recently as we were attending a concert in the 3 arena. Everything from start to finish was just lovely. When we arrived we were delighted with the complimentary tea scones and pastries in the drawing room. This is such a nice touch and the fact that it was complimentary was better again!  
Our room was lovely and spotlessly clean with great wifi.
The breakfast the next morning was to die for and was I think the best breakfast I've had in any hotel or guesthouse, such a choice and so tasty. 
Staff are extremely friendly with a special mention to ewa the waitress at breakfast and deirdre who dealt with us checking out.  
So down to earth, it was like being at home, chatting away and so relaxed. 
Will definitely be wanting another excuse to come here soon! 

Amy c.",5,2015,03,17
233,Rugby/valentines weekend,"Fantastic service, beautiful room, friendly staff and the breakfast is out of this world! It's in close proximity to the Aviva stadium and within walking distance of shops, bars, restaurants. Free parking was very handy and we were allowed to check in much earlier than the stated time - very flexible and welcoming hotel. We have booked our next visit already! ",5,2015,03,17
233,Great value Hotel,"A lovely hotel  . The four poster made for a treat. Lovely bathroom with a large tub. Service great, with friendly staff. Have stayed several times and would stay again - good value for money. Great location especially if you love rugby as its right next to Lansdowne Road !!",4,2015,03,17
233,Amazing!,"We stayed here for 5 nights and it was amazing!
Fabulous breakfast, beautiful comfortable cosy rooms, fantastic location and the staff can not do enough for you.
If you need a lovely, friendly place to stay in Dublin don't look any further!!",5,2015,03,14
233,Good place in nice area,"Hotel is in really good location, not too far from city centre. Rooms are lovely with nice old furniture, comfortable beds. Breakfast was amazing, very good service from ladies in restaurant and front desk. Only little minus is for housekeeping, they need more practice, not clean enough, always forgetting something...not good as other departments in Ariel house.",4,2015,03,13
233,Good for the money,"This B&B was overall very good, but had its ups and downs. 
When we first arrived we were booked on the garden level which I specifically asked not to be put on. The concierge was very nice and immediately found us another room. But was not able to find the key to the room so we went to dinner and by the time we came back he had the spare key. 
The room was clean and inviting. We LOVED the fact that we not only had a shower but a full size tub too.
Breakfast was included in our price which made this even more affordable. The scones were fonominal and the made to order breakfast menu was delicious as well. 
Our room phone didn't work, but the concierge was kind enough to call out and help us.
The location was a bit far to walk into the center of town. We fared ok, but it was a good 25-30 min walk. 
All-in-all we were happy and would stay there again.

233,A delightful stay in Dublin,"Ariel house is in a great location, with comfortable rooms, ample space, and a lovely bathroom.  We had an issue with the shower which was quickly resolved, and a discount given for the inconvenience for that first night's cost.  Once that was behind us, I'd have to say it was the best shower ever - perfect high pressure!  Breakfast was top-notch, too, in a bright, pleasant sunroom.  You can't go wrong here.",5,2015,03,13
233,An Incredible Find,"Ariel House in Dublin is an incredible find; I'm not sure I believed places like this existed anymore. It's warmly run with attention to little details, like the homemade cakes and treats that greet travelers upon arrival in the drawing room. The baker is extraordinarily talented, as we saw both at teatime and breakfast--but that's only one of an excellent team that included top notch wait staff and service professionals behind the front desk. We had a triple on the second floor that was charming and very clean, with a spotless newly remodeled bathroom. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were well heated. Good, easy to use wifi. The breakfasts were delicious and worth lingering over to try locally sourced foods including delightful Irish cheeses like the Cashel Blue from Tipperary. Breakfast entree choices were broad and the plates were plentiful. We also had a delightful, relaxing tea one afternoon. The terrific waitstaff told us they'd wrap our leftovers and keep them in the fridge until we returned from the theatre. When we collected them, we found they'd restocked what we'd eaten and left us a two-tiered tray of more goodies--much appreciated by our 14 year old son, who is always hungry. In the morning, the staff was kind enough to notice that he had a healthy appetite and offered to bring him extra pancakes without him having to ask. There are many lovely restaurants within walking distance, and Ariel House is located within a couple of blocks of the US Embassy. We loved the neighborhood and took a pleasant walk as we hit some sunny, warm March weather. There's no where else I'd ever want to stay in Dublin and I've already recommended Ariel House to two groups of friends who promptly booked their stays. We wanted to stay at Ariel House our first night in Dublin but it was fully booked, so I recommend booking early if you want to experience this fantastic place.",5,2015,03,12
233,A really special place!,"I visited with my boyfriend in February and we had never been to Dublin before. Ariel house looked lovely from the photos anyway but when we got there we were even more taken a back! It was beautiful! The drawing room was lovely, the double room we stayed in had incredible furniture and the breakfast was amazing with a good selection. Every single staff member was friendly and polite and genuine. I have never been somewhere where the service was that lovely, made us feel pretty special. Highly recommend staying here!",5,2015,03,10
233,good location for getting to city centre,"-Very clean and spacious room-
-Lovely breakfast & home baking-
-Good value-
-Friendly & helpful staff-
-Free wifi-
Good tip-eat at the Lobster Pot restaurant in Ballsbridge for a delightful meal which was excellent value.",5,2015,03,08
233,We'll Be Back!,"We had a wonderful three night stay in February. The room was cozy and the beds were comfortable and the TV and WiFi worked beautifully. The breakfasts are amazing and kept us going till tea time, and as a bonus tea and coffee and cakes are often available in the lounge. On Saturday we had to wait for a table at breakfast, so had a cup of coffee and read the paper in the lounge, but after barely 10 minutes we were called in. Just something to be aware of if you have a time constraint. The dining room is lovely and bright with windows looking over the garden and a great view of Aviva Stadium.

There is a DART station minutes away, but we usually just walked the 20 minutes into the center. It's a well traveled route and we always felt safe, even at night.
The staff are amazing - front desk, dining room, housekeeping - all went out of their way to make as feel welcome and comfortable.

This is an old building and the floorboards do creak a bit, but we never heard people in the other rooms or were disturbed in any way. The water pressure in the shower was great. It would have been nice to have more than one armchair in the room and also more space by or on the sink to put toiletries, but these are minor quibbles.

We wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Ariel House to family and friends, and when we next come to Dublin we will definitely stay here.",5,2015,03,06
233,Loved it,"Stayed in ariel house Sunday 1st March after Rugby match. Cannot recommend enough. absolutely loved everything about ariel house. From the min we arrived to when we left. Parking, rooms, afternoon tea. And the breakfast. If you need gluten free you will have no problem here. The breakfast was to die for. We will be back and have recommend ariel house to everyone that we think will be staying in Dublin. The Aviva is touchable!!!!",5,2015,03,05
233,Loved it!!!,"I absolutely loved this little place. It really exceeded my expectations. It has some lovely vintage touches. There is coffee and cakes at regular intervals. Location is just outside the city but right next to the tram stop.

Rooms are comfortable and spacious. 

I would definately return.

",5,2015,03,03
233,A Warm Welcome,"We were on our Honeymoon and had flown overnight.  We showed up at 9:30 in the morning.  They took our luggage, gave us breakfast and invited us to relax in the beautiful front room with the Morning paper.  And by 11:00 we were in our room, getting settled and shortly after snoozing away a sleepy afternoon.
The staff were wonderful and offered some tips on tipping in Ireland.
The room was comfortable with high ceilings and big wonderful windows.
Breakfast at this B&B was very generous.  I'll never be able to eat instant Oatmeal again; I am definitely hooked on Porridge which sticks to your ribs and is very healthy; at least until you add sugar, butter, cream and yes, maple syrup : P",5,2015,03,02
233,Rugby weekend,"We had travelled down to watch the rugby. Ariel House is ideally situated beside the Dart rail system and the Aviva Staduim. The rooms are very nice, clean and warm. We had afternoon tea on the day of our arrival. Definitely recommended, From the lovely sandwiches to the range of mouth watering pastries.  Breakfast the next morning was gorgeous, some of the nicest sausages i have tasted in a long time. Book well ahead of your trip as it can be very busy",5,2015,03,02
233,Excellent hotel full of character,"My daughter and I spent 2 nights here in early February and could not find any fault. Excellent service, wonderful food and a very comfortable room full of character.  We knew we were a 15 mins walk from the centre but we enjoy walking and it was no hardship. The weather was kind but if needed we could have easily  gone along the road to get the train into the centre. There are plenty of eating places in the area if you do not wish to go into the city centre in the evening.We would recommend Ariel House to all our friends and if we ever return to Dublin would certainly go back and stay there.",5,2015,03,01
233,Old world charm with first class hospitality,"I concur with all the glowing reports re fab breakfast and absolutely sublime afternoon teas - my waistline is still recovering!!!  The staff make this place with their cheery attitude and kindness. Thank you.

My partner and I stayed for a long weekend in the Jnr Suite, room 251 (William Butler Yeats) and can recommend this room for a good nights sleep. I am a very light sleeper and can be picky about noise. Although front of the property, there was little road noise and a few foot steps overhead, few creaky floor boards which is to be expected in an old property but nothing to upset me and send me ranting to reception! 

My only criticism would be that there are no shower caps available in this room and no spare throw or blanket should one feel chilly at night. Otherwise, a perfect stay and would not hesitate to recommend.  I look forward to staying here again in the future.",4,2015,02,28
233,No need for chain hotels,"I quite often need to go to Dublin to visit our offices over there - have always stayed in one of the chain hotels - you know what you're going to get so fair enough.

My boss recommended Ariel House to me and having stayed there, I can see why. Located in Ballsbridge and a 20 min walk to our office - and a very short stagger to the Dart station, this is very nice location. The hotel is warm and homely and the staff really helpful and friendly - I had a huge room with 4-poster bed and a large en-suite. Breakfast was plentiful and tasty.

I can't see any reason not to come back here!",5,2015,02,26
233,Outstanding Hotel,"We had the great pleasure of staying in this hotel for a weekend in February. On arrival we were greeted as though we had stayed at Ariel House many times before and were now great friends with the staff. We were able to check in to a lovely and spotlessly clean room early. The facilities were lovely and there was no noise to disturb us from either the road or other guests (we requested a room at the back of the hotel). We enjoyed complimentary afternoon tea on the day we checked in and an amazing breakfast in the morning. We had a late flight on the day that we checked out. Not only were we invited to leave our luggage in the luggage room for the day but we were also invited to more complimentary afternoon tea for us and our friend. 

I have stayed in a lot of really lovely hotels courtesy of the reviews on TripAdvisor but we were both agreed that this was the best yet. It was also surprisingly inexpensive especially when compared to everything else in Dublin!. Our dinner on the first night cost more than this hotel stay.",5,2015,02,24
233,THE BEST HOTEL EVER,"We visited Dublin for the first time and this was the best place to stay, it was near the rugby stadium and a train station so that we could get into city centre  really quickly, The breakfast was amazing and filled us up for the whole day. The afternoon tea was a real treat and a welcome bonus. The room had everything we wanted and everyone was really friendly. I would definitely recommend staying at the Ariel House when you visit Dublin.",5,2015,02,23
233,Best afternoon tea in Dublin,"Yesterday, I visited Ariel House for the third time in a couple of months for their fabulous afternoon tea. I've had afternoon tea in The Merrion, The Shelbourne and a couple of other places around Dublin but this is hands down the best afternoon tea in Dublin!

The venue is a gorgeous Victorian house in the Ballsbridge area and afternoon tea is served in the conservatory area at the back. The table is set beautifully with dainty china and newbridge cutlery. And the food is just fantastic! It's not the same fancy patisseries as you would get in The Merrion but it's 3 times tastier and well presented! You start off with plates of sandwiches and tea/coffee and then plates upon plates upon tiered plates of scones, cupcakes, biscuits etc. arrive. Be warned - come hungry! 

Look out for the melting moments! They are just divine and I wish they were available to buy but it's probably best for my waistline that they're not ;) 

All the staff are super friendly and the tea comes to an amazing 20 euro per head.

Don't take my word for it, just go and try it yourself! You will not be disappointed. 

",5,2015,02,22
233,A True Gem,"We stayed 2 nights at this wonderful hotel located in the lovely suburb of Ballsbridge. The hotel is situated on a road of very smart Victorian properties literally 2 minutes walk from Landsdown Road DART station. From the moment we arrived we were given a warm welcome from the friendly attentive staff, and even though our room wasn't ready ( we'd arrived earlier than we had stated in our booking) we were offered the option of waiting in the beautiful Drawing Room with a cup of tea. Our first floor room was spacious and well furnished with a lovely modern Bathroom complete with a full size bath. Having walked back to the hotel later that afternoon, which takes about 25-30 mins from central Dublin, we discovered that that the hotel provides complimentary tea, coffee, and a selection of homemade cakes & scones etc in the Drawing Room. One of the highlights of this hotel is the Breakfast which is truly amazing. Nearly everything is homemade, with an imaginative selection of dishes beautifully presented and cooked to order. This Hotel is excellent value for money, with a management and staff who's customer service is second to none. This hotel is highly recommended for anyone visiting Dublin wanting a quiet and relaxing location.",5,2015,02,21
233,My new favourite place to stay in Dublin,"I opted to stay over in Dublin at the last minute and I was delighted to get a booking at Ariel House.  Even more delighted when I stayed.  I love this location, in the shadow of the Aviva stadium, a really pleasant part of Dublin to take a walkabout and soak up the atmospheric and historic area.  The place itself, was immaculate and so elegant.  These old buildings are a treat and more so when they are kept in such pristine condition.  There's a lovely warm, welcoming and comfortable atmosphere here.  The room was so clean and the bed so comfy.  Parking on site wasn't available to me - there's only a few spots - but on street parking is free over night and the hotel offered to pay for a few hours in the morning. In the morning, I enjoyed the best breakfast I've had, right up there with 5 star hotels.  The choice was incredible, they stated all the suppliers, local Irish.  There was on site baked delights, gorgeous buffet and an impressive array of hot dishes.  Papers were on hand and the staff were attentive and hospitable. I'll be back, asap!!",5,2015,02,20
233,Perfect for peaceful retreat or rugby match,"Recently stayed in a superior room here with mt husband. It was perfect for the match we were going to see but also a fabulous location to have a quiet night away. The staff here are amazing,breakfast is to die for and the little touches like home baking and handmade chocs will ensure our return to this hidden gem .",5,2015,02,18
233,Will stay again,"If I return to Dublin I wouldn't hesitate to stay at Ariel House again.  It is not in the heart of the city, but is on a beautiful, quiet, tree lined street and you can get a good nights rest here.  The DART is across the street and can take you downtown.  We also walked about 15-20 min to catch our Green HOHO bus that took us to all the tourist destinations (definitely recommend this bus as a great value).  There is a Hertz Car Rental a few blocks down from the B&B so you can pick up a car without driving through the city.  

Our flight was suppose to come in around 5am and our pilot was happy to announce that we arrived an hour early!  Yay!  Wait.. what are we going to do at 4am in Dublin?  We took a taxi to Ariel house and they were SO accommodating.  They gave us coffee/tea and let us lounge/nap in the common room.  This same room would have snacks and drinks each evening when we came back from our city adventures.

The breakfast room is beautiful and feels like a fancy hotel more than a B&B.  The food was plentiful and delicious.  Service was always friendly and helpful.  The rooms downstairs were a little rundown and not very impressive, but they did the job and who comes to Dublin to stay in their room anyway?  Try to get a room upstairs, if possible, they were a little nicer.",4,2015,02,18
233,Excellent B+B,"Lovely B+B close to the city and Aviva stadium.
We booked here for a night at the 3 Arena. It's a 20 min walk but as it was raining we chose to drive and park at Thorncastle street and were only a five minute walk across the bridge to the arena, and when all over didn't have any traffic jams to contend with.

We changed our booking to Ariel House after reviewing our original booking where everything was extra (no parking, no breakfast and the reviews weren't as good).

Here you have free parking, breakfast included and a lovely quiet locality, not far from Ballsbridge village.
From the minute we arrived, actually from before we arrived, nothing was too much to ask. We were greeted on arrival after a long drive by a very pleasant receptionist, told to drop our bags and come back down for some tea and cakes to relax. The room was spotless. The house itself is an old Victorian house in very good condition, the odd creaking floor board which adds character. We had a great nights sleep, and next morning had a great spread for breakfast. I liked the way you are told where the produce you are eating comes from. The whole team were really attentive and we really enjoyed the stay. Will definitely be back again.",4,2015,02,17
233,Perfect choice!,"We spent one night at Ariel House and we're sorry we could not stay longer. From the moment we stepped inside the door we were surrounded by friendliness. Nothing was too much trouble. Our room was comfortable and spotlessly clean. The location is ideal as it is right beside the DART station for travel into the city or to explore North or South Dublin and, of course, 5 minutes walk to Aviva Stadium if you are a rugby supporter. The wonderful breakfast set us up for the day, especially the Irish soda bread!! Thank you all of you at Ariel House.",5,2015,02,16
233,What a fabulous place to stay,"We stayed here for a February weekend and absolutely loved the place. We received the best reception ever from Cecile who was friendly, offered drinks, an overview of Dublin, top places to visit and an ear to ear smile... all before 9am. The rest of the staff were just lovely too and made our stay a phenomenal experience.

The location is near to the Dart and trains go into the city regularly and if you fancy a walk it's a nice tramp through the southern suburbs into town.

The room was spacious, bright, clean and very comfortable.

NOW.... let me tell you about the breakfast. The buffet was made up of fresh produce and home baked breads and scones. The local cheeses were lovely, the fruit tasty and a good quality coffee was on offer. If you're a meat eater, you should go for the cooked breakfast, as I suspect it's the finest in Ireland! 

Thanks. We will be seeing you again. ",5,2015,02,14
233,Best dublin accommodation yet,"Stayed for 1 night on business and was really impressed. I have stayed at a good number of hotels in dublin over the last 20 years and this was certainly the best yet, and I've stayed in some of the finest! Nothing is too much trouble for the staff/ management. I arrived on a Thursday afternoon and asked if there was parking nearby as the car park was full. This was not required as the staff quickly rearranged some vehicles and I was in. After check in I was offered tea or coffee along with a selection of excellent looking cakes and pastries in the drawing room. Breakfast was as stated on previous reviews excellent, I don't recall a better one. The room was spacious and warm with a powerful shower in the spotless bathroom. I have just arrived home and am in the process of booking a break at the Ariel house later in the year with my wife. Can't wait!",5,2015,02,13
233,Best place to stay,"My partner & I was visiting friends in Dublin, and come across Ariel House on the internet. Ariel House is just outside Dublin town, and it's so lovely to be in a quite area. Ariel House is a good old fashion place, full of comfort & class, with a communal lounge for all the guessed to gather for free tea, and cakes if they wish. The staff are very friendly, and the service is amazing, going the extra mile to make the guess feel comfortable in there stay. Even the manager made time to welcome the guessed and made you feel welcomed. The breakfast is excellent, a good variety of cereals, and cooked foods, again the staff where very friendly & the service was amazing. I would defiantly stay at Ariel House again.",5,2015,01,29
233,"Went back after four years, still amazing!","I stayed at Ariel House during my very first stay in Dublin, 4 years ago. It was now time to go back, and my stay was amazing, just as expected. The drawing room was lovely decorated for Christmas, we got served hot tea and cakes every evening by the staff and we got treated to the afternoon tea. That was one of the loveliest experiences of my life, I felt so well taken care of. 

I truly recommend staying at Ariel House. They treat you like royalty, their food is amazing, the rooms are amazing and the staff will mak sure you have a great stay. They will help you with anything from checking train timetables to making sure you never run out of hot tea. Best hotel staff ever, no doubt!!",5,2014,12,28
233,Best stay in Dublin!!!,"This was our first stay in the Ariel House in December. We stayed in many Hotels in Dublin but the Ariel House was really the best. The breakfast is wonderful and so delicious. The staff so friendly and helpful. We had a great room. And the way to the City Centre is near by with Dart or Bus. I can´t believe that we could get every day all these lovely cakes and pastries, coffee and tea in the beautiful Drawing Room for free. Thanks so much you made our stay perfect!!!!!!
I´m sure we come again.",5,2014,12,25
233,"Lovely hotel, great breakfast","Staying for a whole week, we were offered the ""Oscar Wilde"" room. A very spacious room. The entire staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast is magnificent! Both the buffet as well as the ordered meals are very tasty. A real good start of the day. Point of attention are the chairs in the room as they look a little shabby and worn out. Seating is no pleasure as the springiness is totally gone.",4,2014,12,23
233,Nice place and good value for money,Booked a standard room. Ok room and a very good breakfast. A bit long to the city centre if you do not like walking. But great with the airport bus right next to the hotel. Tried some nice restaurants in the nearby area.,3,2014,12,21
233,Highly recommended,"This house was recommended by friends who were here in the fall and we are glad they did.  We had a wonderful 4 night stay in the lovely and safe area of Ballsbridge and either walked, took the bus, or a taxi to the attractions of Dublin.  The neighborhood restaurants were terrific and close by and this house serves the best and most complete breakfast in all of IRELAND.  The staff is friendly, accommodating and the rooms are lovely.  I had requested a king bed and a bathtub and got both!  We were thrilled with our experience and will definitely be back. 
The day we left, the house manager drove us to the train station on her way home!  Talk about service!",5,2014,12,12
233,Second visit,"This is the second time we have stayed here and it didn't disappoint, the home baking with tea/coffee on arrival is a lovely touch and the breakfasts are excellent, room was lovely and it's handy for town!",5,2014,12,12
233,short stay,"stayed for one night and found the experience very positive. staff exceptional. room small but adequate.very comfortable sleep. great location and delicious breakfast.small area of what appeared to be damp over curtain area however hotel spotless and hate to mention anything in complaint,",4,2014,12,10
233,Very quaint and,"Very quaint and helpful staff 

My wife, daughter and I visited in early June. The B&B was on a side, right off a main drive. It was about a 30 minute walk to the main action of Dublin.

The room was as it was described and very nice. Being warm, and no AC, the staff did bring us a fan upon request.

I would recommend this B&B.

There is a one or two week window, generally when the local kids are having their final tests, when the weather is amazing. We packed for cool and damp, but had to rewash and wear the few summer (Shorts and t-shirts) we had. Be prepared for anything, but in early June you might see sunny and 75 every day!",5,2014,12,10
233,Excellent overnight in Dublin,"My husband and I were in Dublin to attend the Bord Gais theatre and on a recommendation chose to stay in Ariel House. It was an excellent choice. A ride on the local train for 1 stop and then a 10 minute walk to the theatre. A  The staff in Ariel House were so friendly and welcoming. While waiting for our room ( just a few minutes, and we had arrived early) we were given  tea and coffee and lovely home baked scones and cakes. We were personally taken to our room which was enormous with 2 double beds. Lots of hot water in the ensuite bathroom and lots of lovely towels. The decor and furnishing is a bit tired but that didn't affect our stay. A really lovely breakfast all freshly prepared and again very helpful staff. Would recommend this place highly. The situation is right beside the Aviva stadium. Great for the Rugby matches I am sure.",5,2014,12,04
233,Spectacular Service,"My friend and I stayed here overnight and the staff was very friendly and helpful!  Before we arrived we even received an email notifying us of road closures due to a rugby match in order for us not to be inconvenienced.  The breakfast was beautiful, even though we didn't get to enjoy it very long as we had to depart early.  Everything was clean and comfortable and my only complaint was that the toilet ran all night but I notified them in the morning and the clerk was very apologetic and I'm sure they fixed it right away.  I cannot express enough how helpful everyone was, with directions, places to eat, etc. I would definitely stay here again, and next time longer!",4,2014,12,03
233,Couldn't ask for better for the price,"We stayed here in November when we came to visit a friend in Dublin. We were pleasantly greeted by the receptionist and as we were quiet early we were invited to sit in the drawing room and had complimentary tea and homemade cakes....delicious. The receptionist then showed us where to go and how to get around...giving us some local knowledge. We went out and on our return our room was ready but we again were able to sit and relax in the drawing room which was festively decorated.
The room was as expected. Basic but everything we needed. The hairdryer didn't work but this was easily replaced for us instantly. 
The breakfast was lovely. Amazing choice. In fact we couldn't move for a while after eating it.lol. 
The staff were happy for us to leave our bags again while we went out for the day and again on our return they were happy for us to wait there for our train. 
In summary we would recommend it definately. Staff were lovely,  food was great and location perfect for us. Short train ride to town centre or a half hour stroll. ",5,2014,11,28
233,Recent stay,"I stayed 2 nights last week in Ariel House, from the minute I arrived I received a warm welcome, this was a combination of staff, the ambiance, Christmas tree, tea and scones.... My room was on the 1st floor looking over landsdowne road, the room and bathroom were spotless, beautiful crisp bed linen, lots of fluffy towels and toiletries to relax in a bath.  Breakfast was a feast of delicious home baked breads, cereals, fruits, cheese and of course a beautiful choice of freshly cooked bacon, eggs, pancakes to name afew. The coffee is also really good which is not always the case in hotels or guest houses. The staff are exceptional, nothing is a chore and Deirdre the manager is a treasure such a charming person to deal with, always thinking of her guests needs.
I will definitely be staying in Ariel House on my further visits to Dublin. It is very accessible to city centre, you can hop on the dart or walk afew mins to  a bus route and of course if you are in the mood for a walk I would recommend walking to city center. Enjoy!!!",5,2014,11,27
233,Fantastic find,"Myself and a mate spent a week here and were not disappointed, the room was spacious and had all the usual amenities, and old world charm. ( I cannot abide chrome and glass in modern hotels. ) We were given a warm welcome on arrival by cecelia. And although we arrived on a ryanair flight at stupid o clock. after having breakfast and a short walk,our room was ready. The breakfast is superb, as are the pretty girls serving it, ewa, anna and jessica. During the afternoon there is tea, coffee and scones, jam /cream, and several other goodies freely available in the drawing room. Everyone on reception was helpful and friendly, especially the devilishly handsome thiago.. All in all, Everything was perfect. My only minor gripe is that i would have loved a nightcap ( vodka. ) after a night out, wine was available but that is not my tipple of choice. However, I am being very picky as This place would be very hard to fault. we had originally booked to take my dad with us, but sadly he died in January. I know he would have loved it. A big thanks to ALL the staff including kitchen staff and night porters and cleaners, you all contributed to making this a fabulous experience.",5,2014,11,23
233,Fantastic reception at Ariel House!,"I've stayed a good number of times at this charming place and it's never let me down.  There is an air of refinement but the place is in no way stuffy.  A genuinely warm welcome, comfortable rooms and fantastic breakfasts make this place an absolute treasure.  Located in a lovely part of the city, with DART accessibility to the centre in just a few minutes, this place stands out as a real diamond.  Looking forward to returning for pleasure rather than business soon! ",5,2014,11,21
233,An Amazing Experience,"We stayed only one night at this superb Guesthouse & would loved to have stayed longer. On arrival we were directed to the beautiful grand drawing room, which had homemade scones, cakes, biscuits along with tea and coffee brewing. We made our way down to our room (328) and we were not disappointed. All the fittings are of excellent quality although on a small issue, the TV could do with being slightly bigger. The bed was extremely comfortable and the linen superb. The bathroom was lovely and I quickly introduced myself to the luxurious bath! All the staff were extremely professional & I must make special mention to the staff in the dining room. The entire breakfast was outstanding and an absolute experience. The owner was lovely and was helped sort out an issue we had at the airport. 
I am only sorry to say that our room was far too noisy hearing footsteps (quite loud) from the guests above us coming home late & leaving early the next day, which lead us not having a great nights sleep.  If we came back to Dublin we would definitely stay here but request an upper floor or the rooms out the back on a side wing.",4,2014,11,18
233,Fabulous one night stay,"It was our first time staying in this property.  A beautiful guest house full of character.  The staff couldn't be more helpful recommending Restaurants etc. We also had the pleasure of enjoying afternoon tea. So good :-) ( A word of advise, if having afternoon tea, don't eat all the sandwiches or you will never be able to enjoy what follows.)

As we were down for the Rugby the location could not have been better, Ariel House is right beside the Aviva Stadium and the dart is just a few minutes away from the front door. 4 stops takes you directly into Connolly Station so if not venturing outside Dublin, I definitely would not bother taking the car.

We stayed in the Junior suite room no 251, a beautiful and spacious room. Breakfast was also very good with a great selection to choose from.  I will definitely be back at Ariel House, hopefully for a longer stay next time.",5,2014,11,17
233,Awesome hospitality,"Just returned from a 3 night break, our first trip to Dublin. I can't take the credit for the booking as this was done on our behalf as a birthday treat but couldn't have been better. The guest house is made up of 3 large townhouses, and is full of home comforts. The staff couldn't do enough to make our stay comfortable, full of advise and suggestions of things to do during our stay. We had a very large room, well furnished with period furniture. 
The breakfasts were the best I've ever been served. The choice is outstanding, beautifully presented and served in a lovely bright comfortable dining room/conservatory.  In addition to breakfast there was always a variety of cakes, scones etc tea and coffee to enjoy in a beautiful comfy lounge.  I would highly recommend Ariel House and would certainly return.",5,2014,11,14
233,Excellent Stay,"Lovely guesthouse, friendly helpful staff and clean, comfortable rooms. 
Great location outside of the main hustle and bustle of the city but just a few metres from the DART or a reasonable stroll into the city on foot. 

Breakfast was the highlight of the stay and was excellent.

Thoroughly recommend this property and will return.",5,2014,11,11
233,"Great location, comfortable room, pleasant and helpful staff - what more could you need!","I stayed here for several nights at the end of an amazing adventure in Ireland…the location is terrific because it is just outside of Dublin's downtown core, accessible by bus.  The room was charming and comfortable, with all of the conveniences included (hair dryer, iron, etc.) The breakfast room is bright and cozy and the food was great - the staff was warm and welcoming, and did their best to accommodate requests. The front desk staff were very helpful and able to make suggestions and provide directions as to where to go and how to get there! Ariel House is a wonderful place to stay in the Dublin area - and there was also a car service (advance booking) available to take me (although I didn't want to leave…) to the airport…Thank you all!",4,2014,11,10
233,Wonderful stay in lovely location,"I stayed here for five nights and couldn't have been more happy with everything. As someone else noted, Dublin is really expensive accommodation-wise and this was very good value all things considered. My luggage had been delayed and the staff (who were all amazingly friendly and helpful) were very vigilant in calling the air tracking service chasing it up for me which was really good.  The breakfast was out of this world! Enough food to fill you up for dinner: a hot breakfast cooked to order, plus endless toast (the brown bread is just fantastic), cereal, yoghurt, fruit, juice, coffee etc. Free coffee and snacks in the afternoon (which I only had once) as well. I stayed in the main building on the first floor and my room was very quiet with a window looking out into the backyard, a nice comfy bed (although the pillows were a little firm for my liking), and a bathroom with a bath as well as a shower which was a total luxury at the end of a long day sightseeing. Very clean and tidy. It is an old building though and if you don't like any noise at all, e.g. creaky floorboards, then perhaps consider staying in a modern building. The area (Ballsbridge) is a bit posh with lovely big houses, tree lined streets etc, feels very safe and it's an easy 15 minute walk into the south central part of Dublin e.g. Grafton Street, Trinity College etc. There are trains and buses into town if you prefer not to walk. There are plenty of nice places to eat in Ballsbridge village (about a 5 minute walk away) and the concierge book actually gives recommendations about restaurants. The Aircoach bus stop is a 5 minute walk away from the hotel which I caught to the hotel, although I took a taxi to the airport when I left (at 4am). The hotel has an arrangement with the taxis for a flat fare of 28 euro no matter the time of day which is handy. I'd definitely stay here again and would recommend to others planning a visit to Dublin.",5,2014,11,08
233,Great little place to stay,"You won't find a five star hotel in the center of Dublin here, but what you will find is a great little bed and breakfast close to everything you need with very clean rooms and amazing people that will help you with whatever you need while in the city along with clear instructions on how to get there faster. This is a B&B I'm staying again next time I'm in Dublin. Thiago, Cecilia and Ana are awesome! Thank you",5,2014,11,07
233,Excellent value for money at this friendly B&B,"Dublin is an expensive place to stay in.  We were here for four nights and our room averaged out at 99 euros/night.  The room was clean and quiet, the bed was comfortable, the breakfast was first class and the staff, without exception, were a delight - so friendly and helpful.

Ariel House is quite a long way out of the centre of Dublin. We love to walk so this was no problem for us.  If you prefer not to walk long distances, there is a DART railway station very close by which will get you into the centre of Dublin in two/three stops, and is inexpensive.

We must mention the breakfast particularly.  It really was first class.  We had lovely bowls of porridge, followed by a full Irish breakfast - two rashers of bacon, a delicious sausage, fried egg, mushrooms, a few grilled vine tomatoes, and the usual potato cake and two types of black pudding.  The bread appeared to be home made and was really nice.  There was a good selection of buffet-type items although we didn't have any of these.  The dining room is small and if it is full you may have to wait a few minutes in the lounge before a table becomes vacant.

The lounge seating has seen better days.  An awful lot of bums have sat on those seats!  They could do with replacing.  Other than that little quibble, we can find no fault whatsoever.  If we wanted to stay in Dublin again at a reasonable price per night we would book at Ariel House.

Recommended.",4,2014,11,05
233,"Great location, friendly staff, comfortable hotel","This hotel is a great value.  It is convenient to the downtown area, just a one minute walk (two if you are slow) to the train, then a few minutes to the major tourist attractions, restaurants and shopping.  We had a car, but it was more of a nuisance than helpful for this location.  The staff are friendly and offered great suggestions for activities.  Our room was comfortable.  Breakfast was good.",4,2014,11,03
233,An overnight stay,"My overnight stay was not the most comfortable. 
The bed was sagging in the middle, i was solo, and the bed was not good, if there were two, I'd asked to move rooms. I was on the first floor. The floor above my literally squeaked with and pressure put on the floor.  And the bathroom had no room for a toiletry kit of any sort.  So the facility I was disappointed.
The good part of this stay: it's in a quiet residential neighbor setting not a far walk from the center of town or restaurants and pubs. The staff is friendly and helpful.  The breakfast is very good.",3,2014,11,03
233,Spacious,We very much enjoyed our stay at Ariel House.  The room was large with comfortable beds.  We slept well.  The staff was helpful and the breakfast was excellent.  We also had access to resturants in the area.  A great stay.,5,2014,11,03
233,Great breakfast and quiet neighborhood,"Ariel House is very cozy. The people who work there are all very nice and helpful.  They have afternoon tea available for guests, which is a nice touch.  The breakfast is great and included!  There is a buffet, but you also order from the menu.  The menu is varied and includes a vegetarian option, which is nice.  My only disappointment was that the junior suite I stayed in looked nothing like the one pictured online, and that I may have overpaid for a lesser quality room.  It was still nice, though, but I think there are different junior suites available and some are nicer than others.  I would definitely stay here again.  It is close to the Dart, but we walked into the center of Dublin without a problem.  We do like to walk, though.  It took about 20 minutes or so.",4,2014,10,30
233,Charming and so convenient,"We stayed hère two nights,and feeled at home.The breakfast Is so good and everybody Is smiling.
We were happy to leave our car in the garden and take the train at 200m for Dublin city and the pubs at only 3 mn.",4,2014,10,29
233,11/10 - highly recommend a stay here!,"I recently booked a trip for my mum and I to Dublin and after much deliberation over where to stay and lots of time reading tripadvisor reviews, the Ariel House was an easy choice.

I normally opt for a nice hotel so was a little anxious staying at a B&B. There's a first time for everything so they say!

We arrived about 10am and had booked a Rolls Royce for the airport transfer, Cecila came out to greet us and enjoy the car like we had. I don't think my mother or I have ever experienced such a warm welcome anywhere we have been. Given how early we were our room wasn't ready but our bags were promptly taken away and we were given coffee and pastries. Lovely touch.

We left to begging exploring the city and when we returned later in the day the room was ready and bags had been taken there too. I'd emailed before our arrival and asked for a particular room I'd seen on the photos. Again not to be let down our request had been noted and we got the room as requested.

We opted for a superior family room (2 doubles). The room was HUGE! Lots of space, comfortable beds, and a sofa. It was perfect. The bathroom was a good size too. No noise from the street bearing in mind we were at the front of the house at garden level. Also very clean too.

Breakfast was FAB! Great selection and the staff were very attentive. Big statement to make but I think it's the best breakfast we have ever had, beats any hotel we have both stayed in hands down. Poached eggs and smoked salmon is definitely highly recommended.

Must also mention the drawing room - after a long day on your feet sneak in have 5 minutes to relax with fresh coffee and delicious pastries. Yummy!

Must mention the Dart for getting into the city centre, it was just short of 4 euros return as opposed to 10 euro in a taxi each way and we found it very quick and easy. 

Overall fantastic stay and would highly recommend to anyone, even if you do like the luxury of hotels, you will not be disappointed!",5,2014,10,26
233,Quiet and close to the city,"Our party of 6 stayed here recently for 3 nights.  What a treat.  Beautiful and comfortable accommodations, breakfast is superb, a short walk to local pubs, a shorter walk to the train station into the heart of Dublin.  If you like to walk, it's an easy walk into the city.  Wonderful and friendly staff.",5,2014,10,22
233,Confirmation of Ariel House Rating,"Easy to get to by bus from the airport, the hotel went out of the way to find us a room long before normal check-in. We stayed one night but returned a week later for our last two nights in Dublin.  The walls are pretty thick but the door and windows will pass noise; still for a light sleeper, I found it quite quiet during the night.  Breakfasts are the best in Ireland.  Staff are friendly and helpful and made available their computer for my flight check-in.  Easy to get downtown and plenty of good restaurants and pubs in the area. Newspaper always available.",5,2014,10,22
233,Best choice for Dublin,"Stayed 3 nights at the beginning of our Ireland holiday and another night at the end. Very happy with our choice to stay here. Staff all friendly and happy to help. My wife is diabetic and they were more than happy to keep her additional insulin cold in their fridge, as the rooms do not have refrigerators. As others have said, this is an old Victorian residence, so the rooms are a little of an eclectic mix of styles and furnishings. If you want a cookie cutter chain type room, do not stay here, but if you want to experience a true feeling of being in Dublin/Ireland, then this is the place. We laughed off any squeaks, rattles or unusual layout. The rooms had everything we needed and were overall very comfortable. It was even fun traversing the various hallways between room and reception. Breakfast was outstanding and should not be missed. Even when we had to leave early one morning to catch a day tour, arrangements were made for us to at least secure the cold part of the breakfast before normal hours. You are only 100 metres from the DART (rail), so access into downtown Dublin was quick and easy. While Ariel House does not have a restaurant for dinner, we found a number of very good restaurants within 10 minutes walk (most recommended by the hotel). Definitely stay here.",5,2014,10,22
233,Best breakfast ever!,"We'll get to the hotel description in a minute, but let's first talk about getting there. If you look on a map Aerial House appears to be a ways from city central, but no problem. If you're  getting there from the airport you can take a taxi, try to figure out the bus/DART schedules or do what we did...take Aircoach route 702 to the Ballsbridge Hotel and walk 2 blocks to Aerial House. After getting settled in you can walk a block to Northumberland Road and catch the 4 or 7 bus to city central (O'Connell Street). Catch either bus to get back and get off at the Ballsbridge Hotel. Another option is to take the DART. You are just 5 minutes from the Lansdowne Road DART station which will take you to the Tara St. station just a block or so from city central. We chose to take the Hop-on, Hop-off bus (highly recommended) and walked about 20 minutes to Merrion Square (stop 5 for the bus) to start our journey. Since we had pre-purchased our tickets (another recommendation) we simply showed our receipt to the driver and were on our way. If you find this too much to digest just ask the staff at Aerial House and you will find them most helpful.

The Aerial House was built around 1853. If you are on the bottom floor you will get to listen to people walking on the floor above, the furnishings are old, the carpet needs replacement, but we would still stay there again! The staff was excellent and the breakfast was the best we have had in any hotel. They have it buffet style or you can sit there and order from a menu. The young ladies that serve you are very friendly. When our stay was over we chose to take a cab which the hotel called for us. There is a set fee of 28 euros to get to the airport (there were 4 of us) and our cabbie was great.",5,2014,10,21
233,Lovely Junior Suite,"This was our second stay at Ariel House. This time we decided to splurge for a Junior Suite and we were not disappointed. Our room was beautiful, very spacious, and a wonderful bathroom with tub and shower.
All of the staff at Ariel House were extremely helpful- whether it be directions into Dublin, ice and wine glasses, or dinner reservations. They did it all for us with smiles on their faces.
Breakfast is definitely a reason to stay at Ariel House. Their breakfast buffet cannot be beat. It includes everything from cereal and yoghurt to wonderful Irish cheeses. And on top of that, you can order a cooked breakfast from their menu.
The location of Ariel House is perfect. Far enough from Downtown Dublin to be quiet at night and yet close enough to walk into Dublin or nearby Ballsbridge for dinner.
We loved Ariel House again the second time and hope to stay again next time.",5,2014,10,21
233,Highly recommend,"Lovely guest house. Very quiet, comfortable and clean.  Staff are lovely. Always available and ready to help. Rooms are amazingly comfortable. Breakfast is outstanding. Food quality is the finest with perfect service.  Complimentary tea and cakes in the afternoon in the most comfortable drawing room. Amazing. Not right in the centre of the action but a pleasant 15 walk by the canal and many pubs into where the noise is.    Highly recommend for a comfortable and memorable stay in Dublin.",5,2014,10,20
233,Exceptionally friendly staff,"Beautiful Victorian residence. Very tastefully furnished and decorated. Stall go the extra mile. Coffee and cakes available all day in lovely Drawing room. Breakfast out of this world - delicious porridge.
Only negatives: 1. Tiles dangerously slippy in bathroom - at least in room no. 228
                          2. Two emails send via ""Contact Us"" on the Ariel House website were not received - even though after sending emails this message appears on website: "" Thank you for submitting your enquiry. We will be in touch as soon as possible!""  Never received a reply.",4,2014,10,19
233,Great location,"A wonderful location, close to Dublin central, but south enough to feel a bit of peace and quiet at the end of a busy day.  Wonderful restaurants very close by, and still close enough to walk to Trinity College, Temple Bar, museums and numerous must-see sites.  The house is such a beautiful place...clean, comfortable, and staffed with extremely helpful people!  Although the place was fully booked, it was QUIET.  Slept like a baby.  Breakfast room is particularly lovely.  I would definitively stay here again.",5,2014,10,18
233,Small but nice,"Ariel house was very cute, in a great location and priced pretty well. I loved that it had it's own car park, one less thing to worry about. The rooms are a little dated but that's sort of part of it's charm. The best part is breakfast, it is just lovely. The room it's held in is beautiful and the service is great. Would definitely stay again. ",4,2014,10,18
233,Very good place to stay in Dublin,"The Ariel House is in a wonderful location in Dublin, especially if you want to be close to the city but not actually on the city streets.  It is less than a block from the DART, the transit city for the hotel.  DART allows you to catch trains, trams, buses, etc.  It is within walking distance of some very good restaurants in Ballsbridge.  Many embassies are also close by. Additionally, the hotel has comfortable, albeit a little dated, rooms.  The carpets are a little worn and the lighting in the rooms is not great, but all-in-all it is a good value.  The breakfasts are excellent and the service staff were wonderful and friendly.  We would definitely stay there again.",4,2014,10,17
233,Couldn't have wanted more,"I booked this hotel for a surprise weekend away with my husband and couldn't have been more delighted! The room we were in was at the front of the house, it was very spacious with all the facilities you'd expect in a room, as well as a hairdryer, iron etc. the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was a good size! 
We were invited up to the Drawing Room for complimentary coffee and cake on arrival and there were plenty of flyers there to plan our excursions. 
The breakfast was out of this world, homemade scones, banana bread, wholemeal bread. It really was delicious and plentiful with the option to order cooked breakfast as well. (I think their homemade tomato chutney deserves a special mention too, it was really tasty!) the staff were very helpful without being intrusive and tea/coffee/juice was topped up quietly and unobtrusively. 
A stones throw from the Aviva Stadium (a great place to stay if you're going to watch a match!) and the local Dart was a 1 minute walk. I'd definitely stay here again without a moment hesitation. Thank you Ariel House for a lovely relaxing weekend away!",5,2014,10,15
233,fantastic place for a stay in Dublin,"excellent service, friendly staff, very good breakfast. The location is absolutely great, in less than half an hour your can walk to down town, and there is a nice beach very close near by. I would definitely choose this location again for a stay in Dublin.",5,2014,10,14
233,Great place to stay in Dublin,I can not add too much to the reviews that are posted about this guest house. The staff is friendly and helpful and the physical setting excellent. The breakfast is warming and well prepared.  The oatmeal is terrific. The wifi is very good.  I will stay here again.,5,2014,10,14
233,#1 in Customer Sevice,"Clean rooms, GREAT breakfast and an incredibly warm staff.   The only complaint I have was the fact that there was no air conditioning in the room. However, I quickly found out that this is common in Ireland.",4,2014,10,13
233,Absolutely wonderful,"We stayed at Ariel House for 2 nights whilst in Dublin for a wedding & our stay was perfect from start to finish. the room was bright & clean with lovely decor & a powerful shower which is always a bonus! My own niggle - & I know lots of hotels do this - our double bed was 2 singles pushed together - but you could really tell cause the middle of the bed was quite uncomfortable but that was only my tiny critique. Breakfast was amazing; the cooked breakfast was really fresh, delicious & the homemade cakes & scones were absolutely scrumptious - one of the best breakfasts I've had in a hotel. But without question the best thing about Ariel House is their wonderful staff. All of them were so friendly & went out of their way to ensure we had the best stay possible. I left something very special to me in my room & they helped retrieve it for me & send it back which I couldn't be more grateful for. Fantastic service, lovely hotel, would absolutely definitely stay again. Highly recommended :) ",5,2014,10,13
233,Theft in our room while we were away,Unfortunately our stay was ruined by the theft of 500 us dollars from our hotel room while we were away watching a performance of river dance. Someone entered our room and rifled thru bags to find 500 hidden in the luggage. No way to know who stole the money from the room but they had to gain access somehow. no evidence of forced entry was found. The staff did everything they could to help and try to make things right. The police were called but no way to recover the money stolen.,1,2014,10,11
233,Outstanding service in a lovely guest house!,"We book the Ariel House as ""bookends"" for our Ireland vacation. Two days here, then five on the road with a small tour company, then two more days here. We arrived in Dublin via Aer Lingus at 5:30 am, took the Aircoach bus to the Ballsbridge hotel (about two blocks away) and walked in all bedraggled to the Ariel house, simply wanting to stash our suitcases so we could go find breakfast and a park bench to sleep on. ;-)  

Imagine our delight when we were told we could check in early!  We slept until noon, then went exploring. Others who say this guesthouse is ""outside of Dublin"" are either lazy or unwilling to walk a bit.  we walked from here to the River Liffey, to St. Stephens Green and all over without a problem (We are 60).

Our rooms were large, clean, had plenty of HOT water and good water pressure. the beds were comfortable, and TVs worked. We had free WiFi, great breakfasts, a superior afternoon tea spread out in the common room and outstanding service from everyone!
When we left on our tour, they allowed us to leave a suitcase with them and we reclaimed it when we came back. 

This beautiful Georgian house is  labyrinth of awesome rooms, each one a little different from the others. 
You cannot go wrong with this as your base of operations!  We absolutely loved it!",5,2014,10,06
233,A Little Luxury in Dublin,"We spent out first three nights in Dublin at Ariel House.  We were warmly greeted and offer tea and scones while we checked in - arriving quite early!  The room was spacious with a lovely bay window, canopy bed, crisp linens and every amenity needed.  The glassed in garden breakfast room was especially delightful and a lovely setting for their gourmet breakfast.  The breakfast menu offered numerous speciality dishes, fruit skewers, pastries and other delights.  All three breakfasts were delicious and the perfect way to begin a long day of site seeing.  If in Dublin, be sure to stay at Ariel House.",5,2014,10,06
233,Was nice but over priced.,Stayed here for one night with my boyfriend.  Only because we could not get a hotel. 150euro for one night. So expensive actually ridiculous.  But we had to stay. Was only place we could get. Nothing special really. Looks nice but all the floors are creaky I find this just annoys me. The bedroom was nice.  The bathroom was lovely. Water was roasting. Bedroom couls do with some touching up just small things like stains on the ironing board. The net curtain on the window could do with a wash. Staff were very nice and friendly and professional at the same time. The full irish was a bit small. One rasher one sausage. Five tiny button mushrooms. One white one black pudding. Three tiny tomatoes on the vine. One egg. Was looking forward to trying the potato cake that is included in the full irish. We burst out laugjing when it was the same size as the pudding. Lovely toast and hot tea. Was a lovely place but wouldn't stay here again as can get a hotel a lot cheaper. But staff were lovely.,3,2014,10,06
233,Handy Location - Helpful Staff,"We stayed one night when we first arrived in Ireland and thought Ariel House excellent value for money. Our room was on the ground floor and yes, it was a long corridor, but the helpful reception staff hauled my very heavy suitcase all the way to our room. Breakfast was varied and tasty and the girls were prompt with service and friendly. The staff here are extremely helpful and friendly. They are a credit to the hotel.",4,2014,10,06
233,Above and beyond,"Ariel House really went above and beyond in terms of service and accomodation.  We arrived at about 8 in the morning after an overnight flight from Toronto/St. Johns.  They immediately took our bags and offered coffee and biscuits in the lounge--in fact they offered us breakfast, but we were too tired.  We went for a short walk and by 11 they had rooms available for us to have a nap before exploring Dublin.  The rooms were clean, quiet and well appointed.  The staff were exceptionally helpful with directions, information and accomodating our schedule.  They provided a continental breakfast outside of their regular hours when we left at the crack of dawn to catch the Irish Ferries to Wales.  The breakfast was exceptional, both in flavours and presentation.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it is in a good location--we preferred to walk into the centre of the city and it was perfect length to get a bit of exercise.  I don't think that anyone would be disappointed in choosing this hotel.",5,2014,10,05
233,Love Ariel House!,"My husband and I stayed for 6 nights at Ariel House and cannot say enough about this wonderful hotel. We were greeted by Deirdre and Jessica who offered us scones and coffee while we waited for our room. We had arrived around noon and did not even expect that we would be able to check in so early. The breakfasts were absolutely amazing and Deirdre and her staff provided excellent service. We were given restaurant tips (some great ones in the Ballsbridge neighbourhood!), advice on how to use the DART (which was just down the block and got us to and from the city centre in no time), recommendations on day tours, and taxis were arranged for us and always arrived within minutes. Our room was very comfortable and the location of the hotel cannot be beat. Love Airel House and will be recommending it to anyone who plans to visit Dublin!",5,2014,10,04
233,Exceptional hotel in lovely Ballsbridge,"Really appreciated the location of this hotel, within a few minutes walk from the Lansdowne Rd. DART station.  Very relaxing after the hustle and bustle of Dublin.  Nice rooms in an 1850's mansion house, beautifully renovated bathrooms, amazing breakfasts, outstanding service.  A couple of minor quibbles with our room (224)...toilet was noisy and refilled v-e-r-y slowly, and there was a ticking sound that drove us crazy the first night there, until we finally figured out that it was coming from the pedestrian crosswalk in the street.  All in all a very pleasant stay and one we would be happy to repeat.",5,2014,10,03
233,Magnificent,"Wonderful ... words cannot describe how much we enjoyed our stay!

We were very lucky and got a wonderful Junior Suite.  The service cannot be faulted.  Breakfast was wonderful.  The decor wonderful.  We absolutely LOVED it.  The little treats in the drawing room were fantastic. As mentioned by others, the proximity to the Dart (rail) is great.  There is plenty of parking available too.  Everything everyone else has said is true.

Stay there, you won't regret it!!!",5,2014,10,02
233,Best Accommodation from 20 days in UK,"From the time we drove in and walked up the steps of this marvellous B& B we knew this was some very special accommodation. The welcome from young Derek was great, he booked the Lobster Pot, a must do restaurant and filled us in professionally about the area. Room was amazing with a 4 poster bed, plenty of room and bathroom was totally refurbished. Paintings, furnishings 5 star plus. Breakfast was also excellent. NO WE ARE NOT RELATED TO WONERS but appreciate excellence.",5,2014,10,01
233,Very nice!,"My husband and I stayed at the Ariel House from Sept 18-22. We were fortunate enough to book the Junior Suite, the James Joyce Room #228. I had read so many reviews before our trip that I was not surprised by the outstanding service offered at the Ariel House, Cecilia went above and beyond upon our arrival to make sure we felt right at home. The breakfast and afternoon sweets were as delicious as others mentioned. Our room was nicer than I had expected. It was probably the largest hotel room we've ever stayed in. The furniture was gorgeous and the room had beautiful high ceilings with a stunning chandelier. We really enjoyed sitting by the large floor to ceiling length windows while sipping coffee after a long day of sight seeing, it was the perfect way to end our day. As many have said, Ballsbridge is a lovely neighbourhood. There are cafes and restaurants near by and you can take the Air Coach bus from the airport (located right outside your terminal) right to the Ballsbridge Hotel which is a short walk from the Ariel House for 8 euros each. 
I would not hesitate to stay at the Ariel House again, I just hope the price doesn't quadruple due to its fantastic reviews!",5,2014,09,29
233,Loved it,"We stayed at Ariel house last month for five days. The staff was amazing. we arrived very early in the morning and knew checking wasn't until the afternoon. We were invited to eat breakfast which was delicious. Deudre & Jessica were a pleasure to see each day.  the location was perfect for us. a very pleasant and safe walk which allowed us to really enjoy seeing Dublin. the water pressure was low, but this was minor.There was limited outlet plugs but once again,minor problem Each night we arrived back to Ariel house and loved seeing tea,coffee and sweets waiting on us. What makes this hotel 5 stars was definitely the wonderful staff,food,and charming house",5,2014,09,29
233,Always wonderful,"We have stayed here many times . It is a friendly well run boutique hotel/guesthouse and each time it is like going back to visit family .
Bedrooms are spacious, quiet and comfortable. Breakfast cooked to order and delicious.
Location excellent as it is minutes away from Dublin travelling by Dart from Lansdowne station.
The station itself is only a 2 minute walk from the Ariel.
Close by at Ballsbridge is Roly's Bistro  and The Mary Mac --a fine Irish pub.
Another great plus is its proximity to the Aviva Stadium (the new replacement for the famous Lansdowne Rugby ground).",5,2014,09,29
233,Consistently great,"Situated near Aviva stadium, Ariel house is a stately old hotel that has won ""best of"" awards for at least a decade. Visit and you'll know why:

Friendly staff 
Beautiful rooms
Excellent breakfast
Plenty of wall plugs for power, 2 on both sides of your bed
Good shower
Towel heater, pants press, iron & board, hair dryer
Quiet
Computer you can use
Beautiful sitting room

The only drawback I can think of is there is no lift. You take your luggage up the stairs — if you can keep the staff from taking it up for you! So friendly.

233,Lovely Dublin area B & B,"We stayed for three nights recently at Ariel House and were very satisfied. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by Cecilia,  who made us feel most welcome. Our room and en suite had everything we needed and was spotlessly clean. The breakfast menu was extensive, and the food was outstanding. When I asked about the delicious brown bread that was served, I was given a little recipe book that the owners had printed up. Quite a nice gift, I thought. Ariel House is located in Ballsbridge, a beautiful neighborhood just southeast of Dublin city center. It's a good long walk if you want to do that. However,  the DART(elevated train) is just a block away and quite easy/safe to use. On our final day, we booked an all day tour to Northern Ireland that required us to be in downtown Dublin at 6:00 am. Cecilia made sure that we had a taxi waiting to get us to our tour on time and even had breakfast - to - go packed for us. We really appreciated that. We would highly recommend this place.",4,2014,09,28
233,Loved the Ariel,"We stayed at the Ariel House for two nights and we all were very happy with our choice. The rooms were a little dated and some of the furniture showed its age, but we not hesitate to stay here again. The day manager was on her game. She ran the house like a general and the staff was absolutely the best. the breakfasts were awesome. We still find ourselves talking about the service and food (porridge with sour cherries!). The cost was extremely reasonable - $99 euros....",4,2014,09,25
233,A Very Happy Couple,"Cecilia, what can we say about this lady. She knows her job right down to the finer points to make your stay a 10/10. There is nothing she cant do for you from the very first time you walk through the front door. Our stay for 4 nights was memorable with nothing bad to say about the hotel.
Now for the breakfast staff, an amazing crew that will serve you and treat you like royalty. Yet they like to joke along with you but keep the seriousness of serving you to their best ability. Myron the breakfast waiter, Jess (sorry if name is wrong) made sure you never left the breakfast table with an empty belly. We were gob smacked had to pinch ourselves to make sure this is real for what we were paying for. We were disappointed that we couldn't stay longer but our travel plans wouldn't allow it.
Location was good, we was in a quiet area yet still not far from Temple Bar and other attractions in the city. You could walk it if you wish or take a short taxi ride, we opted for the taxi as our bellies were so full from breakfast lol.
Cecilia, Myron & Jess also all other staff a big thank you and keep up the great work & look forward to seeing you lovely people again.",5,2014,09,22
233,Wonderful Stay!,"We recently stayed at Ariel House for 3 nights.  First of all, the property is in a great location just outside of city center.  The location was lovely, peaceful and within walking distance of many wonderful reasonably priced restaurants.  We went into the city center each day and it was an easy short cab ride or one could jump on the Hop On/Hop Off bus about 15 minutes walk away.  Very easy in and out of the city center.  We would not stay in Dublin any other way as the downtown area is crammed with tourists and very loud/busy.  Ariel House was just far enough away to escape all of that but still get quickly back into town if desired. The room was very nice both well kept and well appointed.  The hotel did a great job of keeping noise out even though they were busy with a full house.  We never felt that there were lots of people there because the property handled the guests so well.  We did not hear other guests or the breakfast traffic immediately above our room.  In fact we were so comfy we over slept our normal wake up time.  The food was wonderful and beautifully presented each morning with lots of variety.  I am saving the best for last though...the staff was AMAZING, really really amazing!  Everyone was cheerful and helpful at all times.  Any need was addressed immediately and fully.   It has been a long time since we have seen such hospitality exhibited by everyone we encountered.  We would stay there again and again...if only we weren't an ocean away.  We highly recommend this property for a Dublin stay!",5,2014,09,19
233,We'll be back,"Fantastic location, near the train (but you don't hear it). Amazing breakfasts! Very welcoming, nice place to loiter in the study to wait for your room, with coffee, tea, pastries, couches and a piano.
Staff was very attentive and rooms were clean and well appointed. Only issue was the water pressure was not very good. That being said, I wouldn't hesitate to stay at Ariel house again.",5,2014,09,14
233,wonderful stay,"Our flight landed at 8AM Ireland time, but 3AM Boston time. We arrived at Ariel House at 9:30 very tired. The staff could not have been more gracious. They stored our luggage and offered coffee. We were directed to the sitting area and coffee was brought to us. Upon our return later in the day we found that our luggage had already been brought to our room.
The room was large with large windows and beautifully decorated. Everything was spotless.... we will be staying here again if we ever come to Dublin again.",5,2014,09,14
233,Wonderful stay!,The staff went above and beyond with everything that they did! Breakfasts were fantastic! Convenient to the Dart station and within walking distance from some pubs and restaurants! I would recommend this B&B to anyone and everyone! We will be returning for sure! ,5,2014,09,13
233,Home away from home in Dublin,"We have stayed at the Shelbourne and Merrion Hotels, which are wonderful.  However, the Ariel House is always our choice now, a comfortable guest house with a super staff including Deirdre, Cecelia, and the breakfast group.  Everything is spotless and welcoming, with crisp, white linens. Location is very convenient, with the DART, bus or just a short walk.  Restaurants and pubs within walking distance.  Breakfast is the best in Ireland.  Lovely to be welcomed with tea, coffee and goodies every afternoon.

We are seasoned travelers and have stayed at the Ariel House four times.  Hopefully, we have the pleasure of visiting again!  It definitely is a place you can call a home away from home.",5,2014,09,13
233,Dreary,"I stayed with my family for ONE night although we were booked for three.  I could not stay another night longer after the first.  As like the other poor reviews we were placed in the basement. The hallway leading up to the room was dirty and dark. The room was dingy. The only window was in the bathroom and you had to stand on your toes to look out the window onto the front walk, all you could see were peoples feet walking by.  It was bad enough that the room had a moldy smell but there were people smoking out in the hall all night.  There were doors banging all night, and though not the fault of the Ariel House you could hear the beeping from the cross walk signal outside the one little window we did have.  A sleepless night it was.  We checked out the next morning.  The trip was actually August 2013.

*To be fair I do have to add that the woman at the front desk was very nice.  She did offer us another room but I had had such a dreadful night I just needed to get out of there. We fled!",1,2014,09,12
233,Nice stay,A quick stay on my travels in Ireland.Very pleasant staff and nice breakfast.Conveneient for all and nice walks in the parks close by. Will be back soon on my travels. Have to say my room was nice too.,4,2014,09,12
233,Well done Ariel House! Tremendous,"We stayed at Ariel House for a three day short visit to Dublin with our elderly (90yrs) parents. Ariel House is deserving of its high status on Tripadvisor both for the friendliness of the staff and the quality of the guest experience. The “can do” attitude is very refreshing and worthy of the very best Dublin has to offer. The lack of a restaurant might be an issue for some but we ate out each night anyways and the breakfast is second to none. Our seniors had no problem making the short hop into town on the DART railway which is a quick and clean way to travel. (15 euros for 4 adults return). A taxi journey from Ariel House to the centre of town is about 15 euros one way and the two drivers we met were friendly and polite. I highly recommend using Dublin Airport Taxis for the transfer both to and from the airport which was in the region of 70 euros (both ways all in) Get a quote online before booking. Of course there are other cheaper ways but with elderly travellers this was relaxing and stress-free. It takes about 20-25 minutes to travel from the airport to Ariel House. We flew with FLYBE from Exeter which is only a 40 minute trip and the guys and girls on the plane were extremely efficient and professional.
We booked the Irish Night dinner at the Belvedere Hotel(checked it out online) For 34 euros you get a simple but reasonable three course meal and a good 1.5 hours music and dance extravaganza. Worth the effort albeit it does get very busy so get there early for a good seat.",5,2014,09,11
233,go for more than one night here!,"Great location for Dublin. 
Easy to get to from the airport - a 2 block walk from where the air coach lets  you off  on Landsdowne road. 
Easy to get around - About 1/2 mile+ to a stop for the hop on/hop  off bus for a  city tour, or the DART Train
It's also walking distance to the best  Irish coffee we had in Ireland.
These owners are great.  They emailed me several times to answer  my questions about Dublin etc. 
Rooms were immaculate.  and it exceeded our expectations - so many B&B's listed for Dublin - how do you choose?  This one was highly recommended by an Irish  Dr I had.  She said she ONLY considers this one for her friends :)  now we know why.  
Breakfast had a formal flair -  with menus of special made  to order items, plus the cold foods  on a  table area.  Culinary certificates for their chef, and enjoyable staff to help.  
This area was in a windowed section of the house that overlooked their backyard.  
Great value - this would be the type of place  I'd suggest staying for several days and doing  day trips to other locations in Ireland... just come back  at the end of the day and be here!",5,2014,09,04
233,Delight in Dublin,"Ariel House is located in a pretty part of Dublin with a quiet, suburban feel but is very close to the city and it's attractions. It is within walking distance but also a short train ride away from the station close by. Our room was very large with a comfortable four poster bed and beautifully decorated with period furniture. The view from our room was the leafy, attractive street. On arrival we were greeted with a delicious afternoon tea in the communal lounge room and the high level of hospitality from all staff members continued throughout our stay. Anything from recommendations of where to eat to laundering at a very reasonable cost was no trouble. Breakfast was a highlight as was the sunny and cheerful breakfast room. There was a wonderful variety of cereal, fruit, pastries etc(and the most divine scones) on the buffet sideboard and also ample choices for a delicious cooked breakfast brought to you at the table. We would wholeheartedly recommend staying at Ariel House and look forward to returning one day. Aside from everything else, we were touched by the upgrade and treats kindly given by Cecilia and staff, thank you so much.",5,2014,09,02
233,Wonderful breakfast and welcoming staff,"This is a lovely B&B, close by the Dart train and convenient to attractions (buses nearby, but we were happy to do the half hour walk to Trinity College).  Staff members are very helpful and pleasant.  The breakfast is absolutely wonderful: warm scones, granola and yogurt, delicious brown bread, and many other items from the buffet, along with cooked to order choices from the menu (oatmeal, bacon and eggs, blueberry pancakes with mascarpone, etc.)  Our room was a nice size, particularly the bathroom area.  We were streetside and kept the windows open, but we were not bothered by noise (possibly a plus for this location over more central to tourist site spots).

Highly recommend a stay here.",5,2014,09,01
233,Dublin-great for a 3 night stay,"We have enjoyed Dublin before but on this occassion we stayed at Ariel House on Lansdowne Road. One of our party was ill and despite arriving very early in the morning the management did all they could to assist and found a room for the person to rest.
Ariel is handy for the Dart into central Dublin and we found the breakfasts to be the best we have ever had even at 5 star resorts..We can recommend the Ariel to anyone requiring a comfortable guest house with excellent food and hospitality.",4,2014,09,01
233,A perfect weekend,"We have just returned from a weekend break at this lovely hotel.  The situation was perfect with easy access to the centre of Dublin just across the street via the Dart.  Our room was quiet and comfortable.  Every member of staff was welcoming and helpful.  Delicious cakes freely available in the lounge, a superb breakfast and late night snacks!  We thoroughly enjoyed dinner both nights in Ballsbridge thanks to staff recommendations, it's a short step to some good eating.  We hope to return.",5,2014,08,31
233,"Wonderful value and the breakfasts are ""perfection""","My family of 7 (3 generations) shared 2 rooms for 4 nights in Dublin.  Its uncommon to find a room in Dublin that allows 3-4 guests per room (sharing 2 double beds).  The staff were very helpful and courteous and you can tell they take grade pride in Ariel House and their job.  We found that it was an exceptionally good price for what we received.  The rooms were clean, comfortable and nicely decorated.  The highlight for all of us though was looking forward to our breakfast!  They have wonderful food and it is presented in such a nice way with a good variety for everyone (even my family!).  The breakfasts kept us going through most of the day of sightseeing and travelling.  Highly recommend Ariel House to travellers to Dublin.",5,2014,08,30
233,not a B&B,"I had seen this place advertised as a B&B but it is so much more, we stayed one night on our way to Galway and it was easy to find due to its location near the stadium on Landsdown rd. We arrived a bit bedraggled due to the weather and Cecelia organised tea and scones while we sorted out the booking, just one of the lovely touches which makes this place much more than a B&B. The room was large, comfortable, quite and had a good bed. the bathroom was large and lots of soft towels.  The place is tastefully presented with professional and friendly staff and for what we paid represented excellent value. The breakfast was fantastic too. Thank you to all the staff who made our visit so special. We decided to stay local for lunch and Cecelia recommended a 5 minute walk and we came across a traditional bar called Mary Mac and we got a fantastic lunch for 10 euros. A taxi into temple bar cost around 10 euro too.",5,2014,08,30
233,Best deal great location,The hype on this place is absolutely justified.  Took a bus from the airport and walked a couple blocks from the drop off point.  An email from Ariel House suggested that rather than a taxi.  The room was comfortable and spacious.  We were on the second floor in the older section of the building which was perfect.  A quiet street although just a minutes walk to the train.  Walking distance from city center.  Breakfast was lovely and served in a room with large windows.  Order off the menu and help yourself to the buffet.  Only one odd thing was the shower head in our room was on the side of the tub rather than at the end.  Probably a function of when they remodeled the rooms.  Plenty of hot water and good bath supplies.  I would stay there again in a heartbeat.,5,2014,08,28
233,Great place - no surprises,"We stayed 1 week. Nice room, outstanding staff, tram station 1 short block away - 10 min ride to city center. Great selections at breakfast including a buffet table with lighter choices. And, the bill at the end of the week was exactly what was quoted to me by email - NO SURPRISE CHARGES. A few small improvements would give this hotel 5 stars. Better lighting in the room - very difficult to read a map or write notes. A larger TV. Yes, we didn't come to Dublin to watch TV, but after a long day of sightseeing, relaxing and catching up on the news before dinner is what I enjoy. The 15"" flat screen on the wall was barely visible from the bed. Full bar of soap - the little round soap samples - barely larger than a 2 Euro coin - just don't make it. But as said earlier, these are all small nuisance that could easily be corrected and I will certainly stay at Ariel House on my next visit to Dublin",4,2014,08,27
233,A Gem in Dublin,"Absolutely wonderful boutique hotel. Huge rooms, huge bathrooms (separate bath tubs and showers) with towel warmers, excellent staff, and tucked away in a quiet and beautiful Dublin neighborhood. Downtown and other attractions are easily accessible via DART tram or bus. Loved staying here, hope to come back again.",5,2014,08,26
233,A B&B like no other..,"We stayed in the James Joyce room which was extremely large and worth the extra cost.  The regular rooms are good value, but nothing special.  Very nice free coffee and cake option in the lounge, good breakfast options, and very friendly staff who went out of their way to offer excellent service.

A cut above the average B&B",5,2014,08,25
233,"Nice hotel, choose your room carefully","We stayed at Arial house for 2 nights. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the breakfasts are amazing and plentiful.
Parking is tight but the hotels provides a free off site option.
We had to move rooms twice for noise which the staff happily arranged. The street noise on the weekend can be high so you may want to ask for a quiet room.",4,2014,08,23
233,Wonderful Hospitality!,"The Ariel House was our first destination in Ireland, and we could not have received a more hospitable welcome. Upon arriving, we were not sure about parking, but were put at ease when the proprietor immediately went down to the street and paid our meter. Later they would move the car into the parking area for us. Tired after getting lost, we relaxed in the drawing room and were served tea and fresh scones. Our room on the second floor, overlooking the front of the house, was large, comfortable, and spotlessly clean. Breakfast the next morning was exceptional! We left Dublin for the first leg of our journey well rested and fed. We hope to visit Ireland again one day, and to be sure, we will stay at the Ariel House again.",5,2014,08,21
233,Could not have been any better.,"It was a great pleasure to stay at Ariel House. The room (a twin room) was excellent, clean, nothing out of place. The entire breakfast experience was excellent, the staff were super friendly and the breakfast itself was delicious. We initially stayed for the breakfast (award-winning, had to check it out) but I will be returning for the warm and friendly people working at Ariel House.",5,2014,08,20
233,"Relaxing atmosphere, friendly staff, great breakfast","I stayed a week at Ariel House in late June/early July and it was one of the best holidays I have ever had. I was there on the occasion of successfully taking my finals in Austria and I was accompanied by 3 friends of mine.

Ariel House is a very beautiful house that dates back into the Victorian era and the front side is made of red bricks. The interior is very comely with furniture that invites you to relax. The reception is located just at the opposite of the entrance and we were given a really warm welcome. We were given 2 rooms à 2 people each that were located in the Herbert Mews, a part of the hotel that could be described as the hotel’s lower storey, though it is just as comfortable.

The rooms might make a dark impression at first sight, but you will get used to it. The room was very clean and just perfect for someone who visits Dublin City during the day and comes back in the evening to watch some TV or play cards with friends. Another great feature is the tea and coffee making facility.

The breakfast at Ariel House is not overrated and makes getting up in the morning a pleasure. The friendly staff will see that you can start your day with a happiness that only a good breakfast can bring. There is no part of breakfast that I can make stand out in particular as everything of it was just great, but the porridge was my personal highlight as I never knew it before and fell in love with it when I first tasted it at Ariel House.

The staff was probably the best part about the hotel. I have seldom encountered people that are more enthusiastic and helpful. If you tell them what you have planned for the day, they will recommend you on what to do to enhance your daily programme. They were very helpful in every single situation and surpassed my expectations by far, making me feel as if I were with friends the whole week.

You need to be aware that Ariel House is not located in the city centre, but in Ballsbridge, a very calm and beautiful part of Dublin. This part of Dublin is just perfect for people that want to escape the business of a city as big as Dublin. If you want to visit the city centre, you can simply buy a ticket for the DART lines, of which you can find a station just down the road next to the Aviva Stadium. You will be in the city centre within minutes and it comes at a very good price. If you do not want to take the train, you can simply walk and it will take you about half an hour to get to Temple Bar.

I really plan to come back one day and enjoy Dublin and Ariel House once more.",5,2014,08,18
233,Outstanding breakfast!,"My husband and I spent the first two nights of our Ireland honeymoon at the Ariel House in Dublin. My father (who has spent a considerable amount of time in the city over the years) had recommended the upscale, quiet Ballsbridge part of town where Ariel House is located. The hotel is just a few stops to city centre via DART, but it feels a million miles away, in the best way possible. 

The staff was hospitable in every sense of the word. We felt so welcome from the minute we walked in the door! Our room — the Oscar Wilde suite — was on the ground floor facing the garden and was quite spacious and clean.  The best part about Ariel House, however, was the spectacular breakfast, which included a daily assortment of Irish cheeses, scones, brown bread, granola, fresh fruit, smoked salmon, pancakes, farm eggs, bacon, the works! It was definitely the best breakfast we experienced during our 10-day trip, and we had a lot of fantastic breakfasts if that tells you anything.",5,2014,08,15
233,Fantastic service and five star food,"I had the distinct pleasure of  staying at this guesthouse on 2 occasions this past month. The service by both the front desk folks and the dining room staff was exemplary. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. Yes the building is showing it's age and the pipes rattle and the floors are uneven but the great staff more than makes up for these minor issues. Our only negative comment was the distance from city center although the train and bus stations were very close, the cost of transport was higher than we had expected.",5,2014,08,15
233,A foodies dream!,"We stayed in room 230 for one night.  My hubbie and son headed off to a GAA match so I went ahead and checked in on my own.  Deirdre was extremely warm and welcoming.  The room was huge with 1 double and a single.  It overlooked a lovely garden. We all slept wonderfully but I have to say the highlight of the stay was the breakfast - delicious.  I had a scone followed by a full Irish.  The scone was AMAZING.  We were celebrating my sons 8th Birthday and our waitress, Jessica, made such a lovely fuss of him.  She was fantastic.  I really have nothing negative to say about our stay but may I suggest that the toilet paper is upgraded as it seems quite poor quality.  Also, the TV in the room is a little too small for the size of the room.  Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2014,08,12
233,Elegant and friendly,"Set in a quiet area of Dublin but two minutes walk to the DART station with frequent trains into the city centre, Ariel House is a wonderful hotel, old-fashioned in the best sense of the word: elegant, comfortable and with friendly and helpful staff. The breakfast alone was worth a third of the price of the room!",5,2014,08,10
233,simply the best,"We spent 3 weeks in Ireland, we started and finished our holiday our vacation by staying here. This guest home is located 20 minute walk from the downtown centre. The rooms were a good sized and outfitted with antique furniture. Their breakfast had the best selection and quality during our stay, they had over 6 choices on the hot menu and a table with fruit and baked goods. Our server Jessica was a very outgoing and looked after us. They provided baked goods and hot beverages in the  lounge in the afternoon. The owners did a great job restoring the building, furnishing it and hiring the right staff. There was a few great restaurants 5 minute walk towards downtown that were great. We enjoyed Paulie's Italian restaurant.",5,2014,08,08
233,Exquisite!,"As an afternoon tea lover, I have tried most places in Dublin and the surrounding areas and have had varying experiences, most of them very nice. However, all have now been entirely eclipsed by the Ariel House!
I organized afternoon tea there 2 weeks ago for myself and 5 friends. I can honestly say on behalf of all of us that we were completely blown away.
From beginning to end, the experience was amazing. We described it as comparable to a spa day, but with food! The waitress was absolutely lovely - so friendly and helpful without being over the top.
The food - where to start! The sandwiches were divine and when we (quickly) polished off the full stand of them, the waitress brought us out more. In hindsight, we probably would have held back if we'd known what was coming! I think we counted 14 different desserts...cakes, scones, chocolates, mousse, lemon posset etc. I won't go through them all as I don't want to spoil the element of surprise!
A really lovely touch was that the tea and coffee was replenished constantly (and, it being Ireland, of course we got through a lot of tea!). Too often I've been in places where you're charged €2 a go for additional top ups. The Ariel House didn't charge anything extra, and at the price of €17.50 per person for the whole thing, I found it to be fantastic value.
Also, we were there from 2pm until almost 6, and never felt remotely rushed or under pressure. The layout is great too...the tables are very spread out so we weren't crowded on top of other visitors. It almost felt like being in someone's (very nice) living room! Beautiful china, snow white tablecloth and napkins on the table etc.
Last but not least, when we finished up, the waitress put all out leftovers (and some extras) into 6 paper bags for us to take home! 
I could not recommend this place highly enough. It would be perfect for a bridal shower, catch up with friends, mother daughter day out or just a nice treat!
Word of advice: book well in advance! I waited almost a month to get a booking, but it was absolutely worth it!",5,2014,08,08
233,Lovely Breakfast,"We stayed in the family room downstairs.  Although clean, it was fairly dark and in need of some renovations.  Our toilet did not flush on the first try (you had to flush repeatedly).  On the upside, the breakfast was among the best we had during our stay.  What a lovely breakfast room and excellent service.  We would stay again, just not in that particular below ground floor room.",4,2014,08,06
233,Delightful stay,"Stayed here for two nights. On arrival was met by the lovely Deirdre who informed us the room would be ready in a few minutes. We where offered coffee and tray bakes while we waited and our luggage was taken to our room while we waited. The wait was less than five minutes which was fabulous! The room was amazing, we had been upgraded to the junior suite. Complete with four poster bed, beautiful views of Dublin and extremely large bathroom. Possibly thee nicest room i've ever stayed in. As we were looking round the room we spotted a lovely welcome card and a little cookie jar filled with their home made delights. 

The breakfast the next morning was outstanding, every option you could possibly think of was available. I had the fruit platter for a starter (it was delightful) and then the pancakes with bacon (delicious). On our last morning we tried the poached eggs with bacon (himself said it was amazing) and I had the Ariel Irish fry (Gorgeous).we tried the poached eggs with bacon (himself said it was amazing) and I had the Ariel Irish fry (Gorgeous).

We also had booked in for the Ariel Afternoon tea on the Sunday afternoon. It was possibly the highlight of the entire stay for me, fantastic food, wonderful service, and the setting was beautiful. I highly recommend. We had lovely little sandwiches all with home made breads. The scones and tray bakes were wonderful. Best of all when we could no longer eat any more they simply wrapped them up for later. Have to mention the lemon mouse type pot it was out of this world nice. Ewa who looked after us was warm, welcoming and friendly. 

On the Monday night we decide to go out for dinner and asked at reception would it be possible to book a taxi, the young man replied

Overal it was a wonderful stay and now as I type my review I'm trying to think when we could next visit! Thanks to Deirdre, Eoin (who handled our booking, wonderful man) Ewa who looked after us every morning with Anna and the lovely man who's name I honestly can't remember for everything! We will be back!",5,2014,08,06
233,Amazing breakfast and staff!,"We recently spent three nights in this hotel.  It is a gorgeous Victorian house with fantastic original features. Our room was comfortable and clean, though we would have liked to have been able to open the window more. The bathroom was spotless, but I gave up on running a bath as the water came out in a trickle.  Breakfast was amazing: everything fresh and top quality, beautifully prepared and with an impressive choice.  All the staff were friendly and helpful and able to answer our many questions about Dublin.  I would definitely return!",4,2014,08,06
233,Excellent in every way!,"I stayed in this hotel for three nights in July 2014. This was not my first stay here and when I return to Dublin I will be sure to book again as I could not fault Ariel House. The service was flawless, the rooms beautiful and comfortable and the location is excellent. The breakfast is fantastic and the staff are so lovely and friendly. It is clear that those working in Ariel House make a great effort to offer a quality and memorable experience for all who stay here. Also, the price is unbeatable for what you get. I cannot wait for an excuse to return and stay again! Highly recommended!",5,2014,08,04
233,Excellent guest house,We stayed for two nights and found AH to be a hospitable place.  The staff cannot be more helpful and the room was clean and well kept.  The food and service was great.  Close to the rail to the city and the AH was quiet and pleaseant.,5,2014,08,03
233,"Only ""OK""","Stayed at Ariel House for 6 nights in July for 89 Euros per night. 

The pros: location, convenient public transit, room price, customer service and breakfast. 

The cons: stuffy air in room (below ground floor room), the wall in our room had dirt marks, bed was very, very squeaky and window barely opened. Found a spider in our bathtub and every day there seemed to be a new fly or insect in our room. 

Service is great, but room was very average (turned off by the dirt marks on the wall as it gave me a bad impression of the room right away). 

I understand that for 89 Euros one gets what they pay for but I'm not sure I'll be coming back to Ariel House. I'd rather pay more for a better quality, cleaner room. ",3,2014,08,03
233,Comfortable and affordable ,"We loved this B&B. We stayed during very oddly hot weeks in July. The hotel is right next to the Dart line (2 euros to city center) and 30 walk to city center. However there is a great area away from the temple bar tourist trap within five minute walk with several restaurants and pubs. The hotel is also 15 min walk in the other direction to the pubs, shops, and the beach at Sandymount village. Overall excellent location. The breakfast is amazing. You have many options and if you need to leave early one day (even at 5:30am) the staff will pack you a breakfast for your trip. The staff are also amazing, kind and willing help in every way they can. The famous Cecilia is a sweet heart just like all the reviews say. I feel like we got a great deal before the positive reviews continue to come in and this hotel realizes in can hike its prices to $500 per night. I would and will definitely stay here again. I would also rec this hotel to anyone. Now for negatives which are really what others may think are negatives (not us). First I can see how someone would describe the bathroom as small. But this is a B&B in an old house so I'm not sure anyone would expect a large bathroom anyway. Also there is no air conditioning so in the oddly hot summer of last week it was close to 80 F in the rooms during the day and maybe upper 60s F at night. If you drive they don't have a parking lot really, only 6 spots. (we took the trains everywhere) other than that its a prefect B&B. ",4,2014,08,02
233,Better than Expected,"Very welcoming staff.  They were more than happy to accommodate any request - they even prepared a to-go breakfast for us when we had to leave early for a coach tour.  The room was HUGE!  We always expect small rooms in Europe, but this room was big even by American standards.  Breakfast was great (as many others have stated).  It was easy to get to from the airport by AirCoach (get off at Ballsbridge Hotel, go left, and turn right on Lansdowne Road).  The DART is about a block away, and the Tara stop is right behind Trinity College.  You can buy a Hop On, Hop Off pass at the hotel if you are interested.  We did (the live commentary is great on the bus, but I don't know if it is worth the money, especially if you can only use it one day).  Wi-fi worked well for us, but it's not air conditioned (they did bring us a fan, though, and that really helped).  Quiet, residential area, very nice part of town.  Very charming, old-fashioned without being shabby.  Best experience out of all the places we stayed in England, Scotland, & Ireland!",5,2014,08,01
233,Convinient Location in Dublin,"I chose this hotel based on all the nice reviews but maybe we did not get it because of the rather warm weather this July in Dublin.  Hotel doesn't have air conditioning which is common in Ireland but being a regular townhouse and having rooms on the ground floor make rooms really hot and hard to sleep in.  The bathroom was really small meaning a petite person barely gets around there.  It was nice and clean.  Rooms were clean too. The hotel staff was very helpful but I still don't understand the online rating compare to Clontarf Castle for example that is closer to the Dublin center and way better.  The price is different, Ariel is less but the rating was not that different.  Parking is difficult too.  If one doesn't get into the few available spots you have to either park far or wake up 6 am to pay for the street parking.  We did not experience the breakfast because we had to leave at 7 am.  It could have been as delicious as people describe it:)",3,2014,08,01
233,Excellent on all counts,We stayed here last week and found it to be a really excellent B&B- quite superior. We had stayed in many B&B's around the country in the preceding weeks and we found this to be the best. It is located in one of the nicer areas of Dublin - which I know very well being originally from there- the service is excellent from the spacious rooms to the the really 4 star breakfast and the professionalism of all the staff. As soon as we arrived we were invited to partake of coffee and cake in the sitting room ! The night after this we stayed in a supposed 4 star hotel in Co.Monaghan - there was no comparison- Ariel house was far superior and cost much less. I can't recommend it enough.,5,2014,07,29
233,"Fabulous breakfast, comfortable hotel","If this isn't the best breakfast then I give in! A superb table of breads, fruits, cheeses (excellent), yoghurts and cereals would be enough, but no, a full menu of freshly cooked food from pancakes to the ""full Irish"" which is simply magnificent. 
There are 37 rooms including comfortable family rooms. The centre of Dublin is 30 minutes away or you can hop on the train.
Ideal for the Aviva stadium - 2 minutes away and numerous local pubs.
A must!",5,2014,07,28
233,Mrs.,"My husband and myself needed a place to stay in or around Ballsbridge in Dublin for just 2 nights. This property was reasonable and convenient.  The staff is very prompt with answering questions via e-mail.   We were able to walk with our luggage from the airport transit stop quite easily.  It is close enough to walk into the heart of Dublin. We were given accurate info regarding public transportation and directions including a map.  The room was spacious, quaint and quite comfortable. We didn't try the breakfast,  but the afternoon complimentary tea and sweets were lovely. We were given assistance with our luggage at the time of departure as we had to go down some steps to get to the sidewalk.  That was very much appreciated!  We loved our short visit to beautiful Dublin and the Ariel House was  a gem of a place. Will definitely go bav backk some day! ",5,2014,07,28
233,Best Breakfast Ever!,"If you want to have the best breakfast ever, book a room at this B&B. All meals were cooked to order and were extremely well presented. The selection is wide and tasty. The rooms are a good size and comfortable. The property is located in a quiet residential area about a 30 minute walk from city centre. Or you can hop the train a minute or so walk away and be downtown in two stops.",5,2014,07,27
233,Great hotel and amazing breakfast,"The hotel is quite nice in and olde style.  Nevertheless, the rooms were wide and confy. We slept like babies, really quiet and relaxing.
The Irish breakfast included was big and tasteful.
Reception was nice and helpful at all times.
Fully recomended",5,2014,07,27
233,Convenient,"Convenient, breakfast was first-rate. Bed was really really squeaky. Room was on first floor with only one window that did not have a screen... a little dicey to leave open when a path leads right up to it.",3,2014,07,27
233,Great place to stay near Dublin,"The Ariel House was a great place to stay while my family was in Dublin. It's not necessarily close to downtown, maybe a 20 minute walk to the city, or just 2 stops not the rail at the corner. It's in a cute upscale neighborhood, in an older building with lots of charm. It is a nice quiet place to stay away from the bustle of the city. You feel very safe at the hotel and in the area, and a staff member is at the front desk 24/7. It is also a short 5 minute walk from some local restaurants. 

Free wi-fi, which was great. Simple, clean rooms. Amazing breakfast included, cute little breakfast room overlooking the garden. Absolutely delicious food with lots of choices and a breakfast buffet with baked goods and cereals and things. They also set out tea and coffee and homemade baked goods in the afternoon in the lounge area. 

The staff is all so nice and helpful. We loved Cecilia! They have great recommendations on things to do in Dublin. They even helped us park our car in the small parking lot, since we weren't used to the driver seat on the right! They were also very accommodating when we arrived at 8am since our flight went through the night. They held our luggage while we went sightseeing. When we had to fly out and left at 6am before breakfast opened, they had little brown bag breakfasts for us to take on the go with fresh watermelon, orange juice, and brown bread with cheese and jam. 

If I am ever back in Dublin I will stay here again!",4,2014,07,27
233,Great first night in Ireland,"My 80 year old mother, 12 year old daughter and I stayed at Ariel House recently and were very happy with our choice.  We had just flown in to Dublin from US and arrived at Ariel House mid-morning.  We were warmly welcomed with coffee and hot chocolate and croissants in the living room.  While our room wasn't yet ready, we were able to change and wash up in another room and leave our luggage while we went out sightseeing for the day.  Our triple room was in the lower level - nice size, with a beautiful bathroom.  Breakfast was excellent - lots of great choices and the dining room was very pleasant.  The staff were very helpful with recommendations for sightseeing and restaurants.  The hotel is a nice walk for active people (15-20 mins) into the center of Dublin.  There is also bus service at the corner that takes you right in to the downtown area as well.  We did not use the light rail service given that it was a holiday and the schedule was more sparse but that is probably a good choice as well.  The hotel is in a charming, older building.  The neighborhood felt very safe with many embassies.  I had a beautiful run up through downtown area early in the morning.  The streets felt very safe and it was quite pretty to run along the nearby canal. It was definitely a great first night in Dublin and I would return there again.",4,2014,07,23
233,Good vs. Not so Good,"+ve: 
Excellent Wifi. 
Good price. (90 euros with breakfast)
Friendly staff.
Tasty, plentiful, Good quality Breakfast.
Ample clean towels.

-ve: Booked a superior room, but the room we got did not look like the ones advertised on the website. It was probably a superior room but was quite plain, but fairly well sized (with a double bed and a single bed).
Location is 30 minutes from town walking, or 7 mins by Dart (2 euros) + 5 min walk. 
Hearing the person in the room above us walking to toilet in the middle of the night woke us up.
Room quite warm as the windows barely open.",4,2014,07,18
233,Could not be better in Dublin,"This is perfect for staying in Dublin. Short walk to city centre, quiet surroundings, but as always in a city, some traffic noise.
Ariel House has a very nice manager, who will happily help you with anything you would want to know about Dublin. The breakfast was gorgeous.
I would stay here again.",5,2014,07,18
233,Highly Recommend for your Stay in Dublin!,"If you are visiting Dublin, I would highly recommend Ariel House, located in the lovely Ballsbridge area.  Completely accessible to city center/everything you would need/want to visit via the Dart, (which is just around the corner), or taxi.  We booked a family room for 5 days at the end of June/beginning of July and could not have been more pleased with the accommodations and service.  The staff is top notch, the space is beautiful, clean, and quiet, AND they have a real jewel in the crown with their amazing breakfast, served in their elegant dining space/solarium . Get the Poached Eggs with Smoked Salmon.  You will not be disappointed.   You absolutely should consider staying here if you plan to be in the Dublin area in future.",5,2014,07,16
233,Birthdat weekend,"Ariel House is a lovely hotel and has great charm. Every member of staff we encountered made us feel welcome and went out their way to be helpful.
Our room was clean and spacious, more than adequate for our short stay. Pieces of antique furniture decorate the rooms and adds to the whole feel. I can't fault this place, it's lovely and we can't wait to go back hopefully soon.
Make sure you try the breakfast here to, delicious!!!!
The hotel is near the DART station so getting to and from the city centre is easy, it's a 2 minute walk to and from Ariel House to the station.
Ballsbridge Village also offers some lovely places to eat and drink.",5,2014,07,15
233,Super hotel in Dublin,Situated in the lovely area of Ballsbridge Dublin close to the Dart station only 50 mtrs down the road and beside Landsdown Road Stadium.  One of Dublins Georgian houses with great kerb appeal and with great rooms clean and tidy and ample space. Great breakfasts and a constant supply of coffee and nibbles in the residents lounge.  Super staff friendly and helpful.  Will be back for sure.,4,2014,07,13
233,A gem in D4,"Stayed here for 2 nights with my sisters. On arrival got a lovely warm friendly greeting and as our room was not ready yet we were brought into lounge for complimentary tea/coffee and home baked goods. Our room was ready within a few minutes. The room itself was in total keeping with the beautiful Georgian house it is in. Furniture to suit the period in the room. Good size room and ensuite. A lovely welcome card, little recipe book to greet us, which was a very lovely touch. Slippers were supplied which was not expected as have stayed in hotels where this is not done. Beds were comfortable, all linen and towels clean and crisp. Guest soaps, shower gel and shampoo provided. Breakfast menu was fab, and food itself was gorgeous. Indulged in a decadent afternoon tea during our stay, Ewa our waitress was efficient, friendly, polite, a totally lovely person. Highly recommend Ariel House. Only approx 15 to 20min walk to Stephens Green or Trinity Collage.",5,2014,07,10
233,So Accommodating ... Well Located,"We stayed 2 nights at Ariel House in early July and it was wonderful.   Located just steps from the train into the center, but a quiet and peaceful neighborhood   A little area with very good restaurants and pubs is a 10 minute walk.   Full service laundry also nearby.   Rooms were small but comfortable.   The breakfast room was a beautiful sunroom, a real treat.   Staff was wonderful ... there was no request not instantly met.   No lift and lots of stairs but assistance was available.   Definitely would go back.  ",5,2014,07,09
233,4 poster bed!,"We stayed in Dublin for 1 nights in February 2013 to attend the Script concert at the O2, my partner booked Ariel House as he's previously stayed in the Ballsbridge area, & he liked the positive reviews for this venue on TripAdvisor. Ariel House is a short walk from Landsdowne Road station, which was easy for access into Dublin city centre. 
We were lucky enough to be upgraded, & our bedroom was huge with a 4 poster bed complete with canopy, which looked lovely & romantic to me, but for my other half being 6ft2 caused a few problems fitting into the bed! The room was clean & spacious, as was the bathroom. We also made use of the communal lounge, & the complimentary tea/coffee & water. The night porter/receptionist was also very accommodating providing us with a jug of drinking water to take back to our bedroom. 
The highlight of Ariel House was the breakfast, great choice of food available, my partner ordered the full Irish whislt I opted for smoked salmon & eggs - which was absolutely delicious, my compliments to the chef. Would return for the breakfast alone if staying in Dublin again.",4,2014,07,09
233,Excellent,"We booked Ariel for 4 nights as a result of reviewing Tripadvisor comments, it lives up to its high rating.

Everything was very good, only negative - there is limited parking for guests.

The rooms are very comfortable and spacious, the breakfast is fantastic, service exceptional, no areas for improvement.

The train station is nearby so real easy to drop into Dublin main for a visit or dinner.",5,2014,07,07
233,Nice stay in Dublin,Just off the plane for one great night in Dublin. We had a bit of a challenge finding Ariel but we were greated promptly upon getting there in the morning. They offered us a welcomed coffee and pastry right away. Breakfast and the room were great.,5,2014,07,06
233,Great value; great location,"Ariel House, a 30 min walk to city center, has the Georgian neighborhood feel we wanted.  Easy to reach by DART.  Breakfast choices and preparation was fantastic.  Rooms were not plush but more than adequate.  Nearby restaurant choices. Staff very helpful.  Great value.",5,2014,07,05
233,"highly recommended, depending on what you want","My wife, two kids, and I enjoyed two wonderful days in the Ariel House.  Although the room was designed to sleep three, the management had no problem with us jamming a fourth person in and providing an outstanding complimentary breakfast for all of us.  Choices range from a full Irish breakfast to lighter continental fare.  Our room and bath were of sufficient size, and the furnishings were what a generous person might call quaint but another might view as worn and dated.  The location of Ariel House may also be viewed as a positive or a negative depending on your desires.  It is in a very quiet and bucolic area of Dublin, near many foreign embassies.  It's about a ten minute walk to Trinity College and another fifteen minutes to the Temple Bar area.  Anyone looking for an active late night scene should stay away.  There are a number of restaurants near Ariel House, but almost all of them are expensive (not surprising given the expensive neighborhood) so eat in a different neighborhood if you are trying to save a little on dinner.  Overall, if you are looking for a good place for a family, solid value, great breakfast, friendly service, and you don't mind a bit of a walk to the main sites in Dublin, you will like this place.",4,2014,07,05
233,Fantastic!,"Without doubt the best accommodation I've had in Dublin. From my super comfortable 4-poster bed to the wonderfully helpful staff and amazing breakfast there really is nothing to fault. If you get the chance a stay at Ariel House is a must, if only for the delicious pastry's (complimentary of course) served in the piano room.",5,2014,07,04
233,Best B&B breakfast by far!,"We just got off a red eye 9 hour flight, we were tired and disoriented. Our welcome was wonderful at the Ariel house. They checked us in early and welcomed us to the continental breakfast that was still out. The staff was wonderful and helpful to us rookie travelers not knowing what to see, where to go, or how to get there. Our room was pleasant clean and comfortable. The bathroom was spacious. We were on the front of the house and although others have complained of street noise we did not experience that at all. Our bags were carried in for us which was so wonderful in our tired state. We were anxious for a real ireland fish and chips dinner and Beshoff was their wonderful suggestion. The staff at breakfast the next morning was excellent. Our food was hot and delicious!! The fruit was freshly cut and the breakfast menu so nice. The breakfast room was sunny and airy with huge windows. Tables were close enough to interact with other travelers if you wished, but far enough apart for privacy if that's what you wished. The front parlor was comfy and inviting with fresh cookies and flavored water out all day long. 
My only negative comment is not about the neighborhood which was indeed nice, but it was a very long walk to the major sites, and parking in Dublin was awfully hard to find and expensive. I just would have taken taxis had I known, but I offer that only as a suggestion to others. I loved this place and would go back in a heartbeat. We even asked if they might have an opening on our last day of vacation, but understandably, they were booked up",5,2014,06,28
233,Beautiful hotel with great breakfasts and service,"The Staff was wonderful and helpful.  I needed help with directions and recommendations and they gave great advice.  Also, my kids were fired up to watch a World Cup match at 11pm but the TV in their room would not play the needed station.  Dermot opened up a staff room for them which had a TV so they could watch the game.  The breakfasts are as good as advertised in the reviews.  Another positive for the Ariel House is their location in a very nice section of Dublin.  Ariel House is a good 25 minute walk or so from Trinity College, Grafton Street.",5,2014,06,27
233,Perfection,"Love , Love , love this place. Extremely homely and inviting. Lovely big triple room and a good sized bathroom. Loved the high tea on arrival and the breakfast was outstanding. A lovely flat 20 minute easy walk into Dublin and the perfect place to stay. Staff are outstanding and so make you feel at home.",5,2014,06,26
233,"Nice, but not perfect","I spent a long time looking for the best place to stay in Dublin. Ariel House got such great reviews I booked a family room (there were 3 of us staying).  

First impressions as we pulled up:  great neighborhood, beautiful old building. Lots of stairs to front door, but I knew that ahead of time.  

The front parlor/shared living area is inviting and there was always coffee/tea/water available.  The carpeting in the hallways and on the stairs has visible traffic patterns and is actually threadbare and worn in spots, especially on the stairs.

Our room was on the ground floor (seemed like basement to me the way the windows and stairs were), windows faced the side, but we were at the front of the building, so lots of noise from street.  It was too stuffy to keep windows closed, but in the morning the noise from the busy street was unreal.  By 6 AM things were hoppin'.  At night after the traffic had subsided (although still kind of busy at 11 PM), we could hear a nearby traffic signal beeping.  Argh.

Had some creaking from room above us and could hear neighbors in the hall.  Furniture was cute for period house, but well worn, as in tops of end tables scuffed up.  The room felt very claustrophobic; couldn't see out due to placement of windows and shrubbery.  One of the curtains in the bathroom actually had paint on it....which matched the wall.  While the bathroom seemed clean, it smelled musty.

The upside to this B & B is definitely the staff.  Everyone from the front desk folks to the dining room staff and maintenance were very nice and helpful.  Nothing was a bother for any of them.

Our room wasn't the greatest, but maybe others are.  It is just hard to pay a lot of money and be left wanting more.  I have high standards but I knew it wasn't the Ritz.  I've stayed in a lot of B & Bs so know about quirky old buildings and don't expect perfection, but I do expect a lot from places with rave reviews.",4,2014,06,25
233,"Ariel house, Dublin","I stayed here for 6 nights and the staff was very friendly and efficient. The best thing was that there was always coffee,tea, cakes and water. It was walking distance to the RDS where the WAFA was held.",5,2014,06,24
233,Amazing and beautiful hotel,"I stayed here for a long weekend at the beginning of May 2014 for my partner's birthday. It is the most amazing place I have ever stayed at and completely outclasses every hotel I have ever stayed at over the years. 

As the stay was for a special occasion, I wanted to arrange something for our arrival at the hotel - emails were sent back and forth just prior to our arrival and I was astonished at the outstanding customer service and speed with which my enquiries were dealt with. 

Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly and shown to our room. The staff had managed to arrange prosecco and strawberries in our room together with a birthday card to my partner, which I thought was a lovely touch. 

We had booked a room in the original part of the property and the same did not disappoint - it is probably the largest hotel room I have ever stayed in. It comprised of a huge bed, 2 bedside tables, a dressing table, 2 comfy chairs with table, another cabinet and a wardrobe. There was also a tv on the wall and a large freestanding mirror in the corner. The bathroom was also a very good size with a full size bath, toilet and huge sink. 

We only ate breakfast on our first morning (due to eating so well in the evening!) and both had a full Irish breakfast - again the staff were extremely welcoming and attentive and I cannot fault the food at all.

The hotel is within walking distance of the centre of Dublin so you don't need to use any public transport. It is also very close to an Aircoach stop with easy access to the airport.  

The lounge at the front of the property is beautifully decorated and they would regularly have home made cakes and biscuits there for guests to sample for free. 

I cannot fault this hotel in any way - the Victorian architecture in the property has been maintained and it is decorated very sympathetically and in keeping with the feel of the property. 

I wish to thank all of the staff, particularly Deirdre, for making our first trip to Dublin so enjoyable and relaxing! I confirm that, thanks to the experience we have had, we are already planning another trip for October this year and hope to stay at this hotel again!",5,2014,06,23
233,A grandly gracious & hospitable hotel easily accessing Dublin's centre.,"There is no need to extol the virtues of this superbly run boutique hotel when nearly 800 reviewers have already done so, and each new review is quickly submerged under fresh praise, So remarks are limited to certain aspects which may prove helpful to future visitors,
    Breakfast. One cannot omit mention of the outstanding choice of hot breakfast dishes served promptly by Ewa & her team from 7.30 to as late as 11 o/c on Sundays. The dining area seats around 28 so that for this 37-room hotel there is rarely a need to wait to be seated. The joint managers, Deirdre and Cecilia pitch in to help when needed, evidencing their ""hands-on"" dedication to efficiency.
    Arrival. From Dublin airport one takes the No. 702 AirCoach ""Greystones""  (Eur 8.50) to the Ballsbridge Hotel stop at Lansdowne Rd and walk 5 mins towards the visible Aviva Stadium. A taxi would cost around Eur 25.
   First Impression. After mounting the dozen imposing front steps, one is immediately impressed by the spacious elegance of the hallway & reception desk set deeply back. To the left is the huge high-ceilinged lounge dominated by a really grand walnut-veneer piano, albeit lacking a piano stool. Four deep armchairs and a couch in front of the marble fireplace provide comfort for those enjoying the delicious coffee & pastries available throughout the day. A good selection of novels is available in the sideboard.
    It is the spacious grandeur of this entry that makes it impossible not to consider Ariel House a hotel rather than a B&B. 
    Rooms. We can only speak for the room in which we enjoyed 12 nights' sound sleep, and neighbouring rooms into which we peeped during cleaning. All are furnished with period furniture which has inevitably seen much use. Ours (227) overlooked the back garden with a side view of Aviva Stadium. There are 14 channels of TV, wi-fi, and tea & coffee-making facilities. Facing our beds was a large naked wall on which a couple of framed prints could well be placed, even though no one pays much heed to hotel room art.
    The modern bathroom had a super shower temperature control which if set to 36C never varied.
    The large selection of guest photos on Trip Advisor show most of the other rooms, all of which appear sumptuously furnished. Obviously rooms on the ground floor have less of an outlook, but all will be quiet as Ariel House, like its neighbours, is set back 50ft from lightly-trafficked Lansdowne Rd.
    Transportation. While within what another reviewer refers to as a ""healthy walk"" to Dublin's centre (took us 30mins to Trinity College) the nearby DART train is best. Trains are every 12 mins and tickets are bought from a touch-screen machine that takes coins and notes up to Eur 20- unlike the buses where exact fare in coins is required, DART's Tara St station is on the south bank of the River Liffey 5 mins walk from the famed shops of Grafton St. Connally station over the river is best for the even better shops of Henry St via Talbot St.
    The #5 and #7 buses costing the same as DART are less frequent with a longer walk to the stop on Northumberland St.These return from the O'Connell Bridge, thence to the Nassau St stop. There are 13,000 metered taxis readily available at reasonable rates. 
    Dining. It is 5 mins walk to the first of more than a dozen eating places in Ballsbridge, and only 4mins to a Centra convenience store selling fruit, biscuits, beer, wine etc. During the cold rainy months this walk no doubt seems longer.
     Service. Virtually perfect. If one flies to Dublin on RyanAir they do not let you print out your required boarding pass (unless you buy designated seating) earlier than 7 days before your flight. Cecilia was kind enough to do this on the hotel's computer/printer saving us from what would have been a real problem. This is a prime example of the lengths to which the management and staff go to on their guests' behalf. Other reviewers comment on the late making-up of rooms. It was indeed  bit disconcerting to return to our room at 3.30 after walking the splendid Georgian Streets & parks to find the room not yet cleaned, but as priority must, of course, be given to guests checking in rather than to continuing-stay guests, we took this in our stride. No one could wish for more gracious and friendly service than at Ariel House.",5,2014,06,20
233,Period Perfect & Friendly,"What a great place to stay. It lived up to its glowing reviews. Every staff member went out of their way to help no matter the request. After travelling for over 30hrs from Australia, I was keen to contact family & my iPhone wifi refused to work & it wouldn't charge.  The girls didn't rest till it was up & running & charged. The breakfast room was a joy to behold & the food fantastic. Afternoon coffee & cake in the drawing room was a treat. Highly recommended.",5,2014,06,17
233,Perfect in every way!,"We spent one night at Ariel on each end of our Ireland/UK visit. Had originally booked elsewhere, and based on reviews, rebooked at Ariel. What a great decision that was! Our first night, we were upgraded (courtesy) to the large four poster room at the front of the opposite side of the original (very large semi). Very nicely decorated and lavishly large. The service was exceptional for our entire visit and every staff member went out of their way to give us directions, recommendations, etc (even though it was not our first visit to Dublin). Our second night happened to be Thanksgiving, and the young woman tending the desk went out of her way to find a nice booking for us (we ended up at Chop House, which was also exceptional). Our second night was a standard room, which was also very nice. The location, although not in the city center, was excellent, and a healthy walk into the center. We especially liked the location because it was more residential, with restaurants and pubs frequented by locals rather than tourists. Nice places to eat without being in a touristy environment. There were plenty of options if you don't mind a little walking. 

The breakfast was also delicious, and much nicer than what you can expect from a larger hotel. Plenty of freshly prepared options, with a good range of cold options, cereal, bread, and so forth. You won't go hungry at all!

We had a bit of difficulty finding Ariel, as it is in a residential area, but it is well worth it. I can't imagine finding any place in Dublin at any price that I would have been happy with. Highly recommended!",5,2014,06,17
233,Another Great Experience at Ariel House,"This little hotel is well-located on Lansdowne Road, very comfortable with great staff and one of the best breakfast's available anywhere. If I stay in Dublin this is the place of choice, wonderful value at c.£100 (110€). Highly recommended.",5,2014,06,15
233,Just Fabulous,"My husband and I stayed at Ariel House for three nights in May.From the moment we arrived, we felt truly welcome! Cecelia was at the check in desk that day, and was so helpful, advising us where to park, since their parking area was full. She was so gracious helping us with directions to various places we were visiting in Dublin and even printed out the directions for us. The room was very large on the lower level with a spacious bathroom. The breakfasts were not only delicious, but such care was put into the presentation of the food. Small vases of fresh flowers on each table and a beautiful menu for the ""main course"" for breakfast were such a lovely way to start each day. All of the food was excellent, with several lighter offerings from the Traditional irish Breakfast. Another wonderful part of this establishment were the amazing sweets baked on site, for both breakfast and throughout the day in the Drawing Room. What a treat to come back from a day of sightseeing to find some delicious goodies, and beverages waiting for us! This was one of the touches that sets Ariel House apart from many other places to stay in Ireland. We have been to many, over our 9 visits to this beautiful country. The location was also a big plus. Steps away was the Dart station which was fun for us to use, rather than driving the confusing streets of Dublin! We felt that Ariel House was truly a home away from home for us. The price was very reasonable and we will certainly be back again! Everything was just fabulous! Bravo!",5,2014,06,13
233,Reviews do it justice,"Stayed last weekend & had a lovely stay.
Location excellent due to close proximity to Dart.
Hotel is epitome of relaxation. Friendly welcome, tea coffee & cake in lounge for your pleasure. Lovely touch.
Our room was at front of hotel overlooking Lansdowne Road & therefore in the Victorian part of the building. Very comfortable.
The breakfast choice is excellent & served by very pleasant staff.
Overall a wonderful stay.
We would normally stay in the Herbert Park hotel when in Dublin but not anymore.",5,2014,06,13
233,Great value for money,"Had 4 nights here early June to kick off our road trip of Ireland. Exceptional service throughout and quality breakfast. Our room was large and the bed comfortable, furnishings dark and in keeping with the victorian feel to the house. Free car parking was tight but well managed ( and worth it - Dublin not cheap to park!). We like walking so the 20 minute walk to town centre was no problem but easier options readily available. Minor quibble - no shelving in the bathroom. Will be staying here again.",5,2014,06,13
233,Highly recommended,"This was a lovely hotel for two jet-lagged Australians. We stayed in one of the enormous four-poster beds in a downstairs front room which was very quiet. We loved the space in our room, and the breakfast was delicious. The service was also excellent. The only thing that stopped me ranking it as five stars was the decor: some of the furniture and furnishings, carpet etc went beyond charming and homely and towards needing replacement or repair, but it didn't affect our enjoyment of our stay. We found central Dublin an easy, level walk of a few miles, but for less able travellers some transport would be needed.",4,2014,06,11
233,"Great location, wonderful staff","We were off to a rough start when the room we were given was below the kitchen. The noise did not stop all night and I was sleep deprived as a result. In telling management the next morning, we were given a better room with many apologies along the way. The next room was very nice and it was very quiet the next night. First class service and a good place to stay, but make sure your room is not under the kitchen.",4,2014,06,10
233,Nice B & B in a quaint tree lined street!,"Stayed one night in Ariel house - catch the train from Connolly station to Landstowne road, dont make the mistake we did and got off the stop before - Grand Canal street! We stayed in the main house first floor overlooking the mainstreet - the room was lovely - I think it was 224 - however it does need a new toilet seat. The room was clean and comfortable. when we arrived we got checked in quickly  even though we were early around 12.30 ish - had a lovely coffee and fresh scones in the drawing room after we dropped our bags to our room (free of charge which is a great touch).
Well the breakfast room and the food is just stunning - I had the smoked salmon and poached egg and my husband had the full irish - both amazing! service great - overall would I stay here again!! Oh yes - just llooking for an excuse to take my next trip to Dublin so we can stay here again. thanks Ariel House for a memorable first stay.",4,2014,06,07
233,Excellent Local Knowledge,"Here's the quick hit, 10 being the best:  cleanliness & comfort=7, location=6, staff friendliness=8, local knowledge=9.5, overall value=7.  During our independent month long, 7 country trip, the Ariel had the best breakfast--and we ate some good ones.  (Try the smoked salmon and poached eggs with their freshly made brown bread)  While the Ariel is a 15-20 minute walk into the center of town, there are trams and busses nearby if you're not up to the walk.  Cecilia at the front deksk was awesome.  There was no question she couldn't answer, no tourist problem she couldn't solve.  Local knowledge is the mother's milk of travelers, and the Ariel's staff helped make our stay in Dublin thoroughly enjoyable.",4,2014,06,03
233,Wonderful experience,"You don't often get a good experience from an old building converted into a hotel in a big City, but the Ariel Hotel is wonderful. The only criticism is the parking. The staff are great and that Irish hospitality is very refreshing, particularly after London! Everything is quality and you get the impression that they really care - it's not all done to a corporate manual. This is going to be 'my' hotel for all future visits to Dublin. I'm trying not to big it up too much so I can still get a booking...",4,2014,06,02
233,room 256,"Our stay at Ariel House was excellent. The staff were all very helpful and nothing was ever a problem. Our room was very spacious and comfortable. The breakfast couldn't be any better. We found the location to be very convenient, with the DART station being close. Our daily walk into the city centre was an adventure. We varied the streets we walked so we could take in all the buildings. We stayed at Ariel House for five nights and thoroughly enjoyed it. We hope to go back to Dublin and would definitely stay at Ariel House again.",5,2014,06,02
233,Room #230,"I can't say enough good things about the Ariel House.  The service is exemplary, hotel is clean and inviting, and the breakfast was delicious and hearty.  The neighborhood is also quite lovely, and very near a DART station, making it a quick and easy train ride to city center (walking isn't bad either).  Our first stop in Ireland was Dublin, and the Ariel House.  Our trip started off a bit rocky, as our GPS failed to work on arrival in Dublin.  Getting to the hotel was quite a challenge without GPS, as Dublin isn't the easiest city to navigate (street signs are hard to find, and names change frequently). 

Once we actually found the hotel, we were quite pleased with the accommodations.  After spending a rather sleepless night worrying about how we were going to navigate Ireland without GPS, we asked the Manager Deirdre  to call our rental car company to see if we could rent a GPS.  Instead of doing that,  she actually offered to loan us one that the hotel had purchased for that very reason.  I was shocked, and utterly grateful!!!  This would never happen in the U.S.  Not only did she offer to loan it to us for the week, she offered to pick it up at the hotel we were staying at the end of our stay (also in Dublin).  We only paid $120 for this accommodation, yet we were getting better service than a more expensive 5 star hotel.  Needless to say, Deirdre's service helped make the rest of our vacation much less stressful.  I only wish we would have chosen to stay at Ariel House on our last night in Dublin as well.  

I will be eternally grateful for Deirdre's kindness!  Should I ever return to Dublin, I will most definitely stay at Ariel House!",5,2014,06,01
233,"Second B incredible, first B not","Ariel House is a large, rambling inn spread across several adjacent buildings.  It's hard to give an overall rating  because the generous breakfast, with locally sourced specialties like cheese, smoked salmon, and freshly baked goods, is truly outstanding.  However, the room we had was not.  The old (not antique) furniture was damaged, chairs were saggy, lights didn't work, and the room wasn't cleaned properly during our 3-night visit (some crumbs from a scone my husband ate sat in the middle of the floor for 2 days, so the cleaner couldn't have vacuumed).  The place is rundown and smells musty, at least where we were in the basement.  The wireless is terrible.  The location also isn't good for an evening meal.  Most of the local restaurants are indifferent, and we didn't usually feel like walking 20 minutes back to the area where there were more places to eat.  Overall, we wouldn't recommend it, despite the fabulous food.",2,2014,05,31
233,Your Headquarters in Dublin,"We stayed at Ariel House three times in the last month and it was a delightful experience on each occasion.  The facility is located a half block from the Landsdowne station with DART and rail connections north and south.  Plus it's an easy walk to the heart of Dublin along some lovely streets and a stretch of the old canal.  The staff were uniformly courteous and helpful, and the breakfast is a FOUR STAR EXPERIENCE.  We were in three different rooms and they were all just fine, although I needed a bit more wattage for reading in bed.  Add it all up, and it's an enticing value all around.",5,2014,05,31
233,Best breakfast room ever!,"A wonderful stay was had in this gem of a house. Staff are wonderful, rooms are clean and quiet and the breakfast is to die for! A short walk into town and many food outlets, restaurants bars make sit a perfect place  to base yourself for a stay in Dublin if you want to avoid the noise of the city. Would recommend to anyone.",5,2014,05,31
233,Worth it for the breakfast alone!,"Ariel House is a wonderful place to stay and a tremendous value. It's a little outside the downtown but surrounded by charming residential streets and within walking distance of the ocean.  

The place itself is a bit threadbare and my parents' room was poorly lit.  My tub had some of its panelling coming off, which wasn't ideal, but I did let them know. All that being said, the beds were excellent and you couldn't meet a more charming staff.  They were helpful, kind, and funny.

And the breakfasts - oy vey!  Not only is there a sumptuous buffet of fresh, local goodies (including gluten free options), but a beautiful menu of cooked food, all served on pieces of Irish slate. And their brown soda bread is among the best I've had in Ireland.  

Ariel House is like your favourite aged aunt and uncle - a little bit worn around the edge but you pay no attention to that because they are kind, fun, lovely people and you never leave their table hungry.  They deserve their five star rating.",5,2014,05,29
233,The best place to stay in Dublin,We arrived in Dublin after two long flights and went straight to the Ariel house.  I can't say enough about this hotel.  The staff was friendly and extremely helpful.  The rooms are clean and very nice and the breakfast is just amazing.  I loved everything about this place and would recommend it to anyone.,5,2014,05,29
233,"Friendly, Helpful and value for money with an Excellent Location","Top marks for the location, service and the friendly and helpful staff which combined with the excellent value for money makes Ariel house our first choice for our next visit to Dublin. This hotel has a long established and respected reputation which has not deminished over the years. The  rooms are clean, large and comfortable. The breakfast choice, quality and quantity will definitely set you up for a days exploring in Dublin. The area provides a large and varied choice of restaurants all within walking distance.",5,2014,05,29
233,Well Located,"Ariel House is located in Ballsbridge which is two Dart stops from the centre of Dublin. It is located a couple hundred yards from the Aviva Stadium (formerly Landsdowne Road Rugby Stadium) with the Dart Station across the road. We found the reception staff very helpful. The room was good and comfortable, our one criticism is that the cupboard could do with a bit of repair and it and the drawers in the room need cleaning between guests. The breakfast is very good. We would certainly stay there again. For rugby fans going to a game at the Aviva, brilliant location, although I imagine you need to book well in advance. The hotel is also located within easy walking distance of some very good restaurants and a laundry.",4,2014,05,29
233,Fabulous room,"We had 258 - with two queen beds, which were exceptionally comfortable, a sofa and a spacious en suite with a proper bath and shower facility and a garden view from the bedroom. I thought it was amazing value for the 89 euros we paid. Plus an elegant lounge complete with grand piano and free tea/coffee and cakes. The staff were so helpful and charming. I asked about the DART (the local railway into the city centre) times and a timetable was immediately printed off. Both times we moved our luggage there was an offer to do it for us. 
Our parking experience was different from that mentioned earlier. On arrival the seven or so parking spaces were all taken. They have an arrangement with the underground carpark that services the Aviva Stadium just up the road where you can park for free - either pay and reclaim from Ariel House or press the help button and tell their security you are staying at Ariel House. This is what we did and it was totally hassle free.
Getting into the city centre is so easy and you don't have to worry about parking your car. I lived in Dublin centre for four years in a penthouse flat with an underground carpark so I was spoilt but would not attempt to park a car in the centre these days. It is a two minute walk to the Lansdowne Road DART station. Three stops to Tara Street on the south bank of the Liffey take seven minutes and you are then a five minute walk from Temple Bar. Last train back is around 23.30 so if you are going to be later than that buy a single trip for the DArt and take a taxi home. A couple of tips - if you use the bus, they do not take notes and do not give change so make sure you have plenty and enough 50 cent and 10 cent pieces. If you overpay in coin you do not get it back. Current minimum one way is 1.80 euro. If you want somewhere exceptional to eat go to Il Vicoletta, 5 Crow Street, Temple Bar. If/when time I'll put up a review but No 10 on TripAdvisor and deservedly. Not cheap but wonderful imaginative flavours, great ambience and staff. Need to book. I would not hesitate to go back so for me this is in the top tier. Ditto Ariel House,",5,2014,05,28
233,Very well run hotel conveniently located to Dublin sites,We enjoyed our stay at Ariel House.  The folks at the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful.  When we arrived in the morning from the US we received tea and baked goodies while waiting a short time for our room.  The hotel is located a block from a light rail line which takes you to the center of Dublin - extremely convenient.  Our breakfast was excellent and was served in a lovely sun room.   Very lovely hotel - much more charming and friendly than a larger hotel.,5,2014,05,28
233,A real gem,"This hotel has excellent staff and amazing breakfast. The suites are sumptuous and have a beautiful view to an inner garden. However, some rooms are old, cramped and noisy, facing the outside. Make sure you get one of the new, quiet rooms.",4,2014,05,28
233,"Location, service, rooms all excellent","This beautiful guest house is located in Ballsbridge, a lovely and quiet community near St Stephens Green, which offers excellent dining nearby (recommend either Searson's at 42 Baggot St, or Bloom Brasserie, 11 Upper Baggot St for varied and creative cuisine). One can easily walk to city center from here or pick up the train to go to Howth for a small Sunday market and cliffside hike. 

The breakfasts at Waterloo were most excellent with a Ballymaloe-trained chef preparing a number of luscious pastries, breads and excellent afternoon tea cakes (especially enjoyed the polenta cake with strawberries). Service was second to none, the staff all convivial and helpful regarding trip planning or asking for recipes. Really enjoyed this stay!",5,2014,05,28
233,Excellent Guesthouse!,"We went above our normal budget to stay at this beautiful guesthouse, and it was totally worth it.  Our room was in the main house with incredibly high ceilings, and a large modern bathroom.  Even though we were facing the street, the room was peaceful and quiet.  The bed was big and cozy, by far the best we slept in during our 3 week trip.  Breakfast was delicious and their service staff were very attentive.  We loved that they offered free scones, tea and coffee in the front parlor throughout the day.  The Ariel House is a little further out of town, but the neighborhood was nice and quiet.  However, if you want to spend time in the city center, you have to use public transit, take a taxi, or commit to a 20 minute walk. Overall, the Ariel House was a wonderful experience and I'd highly recommend it to other travellers!",5,2014,05,22
233,A Great Experience,"After a gruelling 10 days of driving Ireland we returned back to Ariel House on Sunday 18 May after having stayed there before our road trip. We were welcomed back with offer of afternoon tea and cakes whilst our room was prepared.

Deirdre the manager and her staff are to be congratulated on the running of this hotel.  Our roo s were celan quite and the breakfast on offer is a stand out. Great value and choice for 10 Euros.
Ewa and Myran who served us breakfast and afternoon teas were just delightful.

We will come back here as the 4 nights stay at this hotel was outstanding.
l",5,2014,05,21
233,Wonderful hotel experience!,"We arrived VERY early on Easter Sunday a.m. after a very long flight from the U.S.

Deirdre, the manager got us into the first available room so we could get some sleep and then shower - then we checked into our ""real"" room later.  All at no extra charge!

The breakfasts were delicious, the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable.

The location is great - a two minute walk to the DART and close walk to some wonderful restaurants and only a 10 minute walk to the beach!

Definitely recommend!",5,2014,05,19
233,Customer service specialists,"We just returned from an 11 day stay in Ireland with our first night here at Ariel House.  We were tired from an overnight flight from the states, but more, my sweetheart was very ill, having started with a cold the day before our departure.  She felt miserable.  We knew checkout time wouldn't be until later, but when we went hours early, hoping for a break, the staff at Ariel got us quickly into a wonderful room where she could shower and rest.  We were both very thankful for this above and beyond customer service!!

The treats in the front room were delicious, as was the included breakfast.  The night of sleep was quiet and very comfortable.  Each time I went to the front desk for assistance, in travel directions, closing our bill, and taxi service, there was someone present, very professional, kind, and helpful.

The separate dining room has a menu or buffet for breakfast and is run like a high end hotel.  Excellent food and setting with lots of natural light and elegance really.  

Highly recommended with no caveats other than parking.  The lot is small and you may have to park on street, which is no issue really, but will cost reasonable parking fees during the day.",5,2014,05,18
233,Lovely Dublin Stay,Booked Ariel House after finding it in a tour book for vacation.  This hotel is located away from busy downtown Dublin which makes it a nice quiet place to stay.  It is easy to get into Dublin by train which is just across the street.  They offer tea in all the rooms.  There is also tea available during the evening in the drawing room.  Staff is great and extremely helpful.   Great free breakfast. I would highly recommend this hotel to friends and anyone wanting to be located outside of the city.,5,2014,05,17
233,"4 night stay comfortable, clean, great service","stayed for 4 nights in a ground floor room. Hotel is comfortable and clean, rooms spacious, parking plentiful, even though the hotel is right by Lansdown road stadium. Where this place comes into its own however is the service. The staff are not just friendly and polite, there seems to be a genuine desire to make sure guests are happy.
My sat nav packed up part way through our stay (charger in car had not been working,) the hotel loaned me a suitable charger for the rest of our stay to make sure we were not inconvenienced.
Needed information on restaurants, it was provided. Came in footsore from shopping, and even though coffee and cakes were available in the lounge and the receptionist was busy  ""can I get you a cup of tea"" I could go on but I think you have the picture.
The breakfasts were excellent, lots of choice and you really have to try the Guinness bread.
They seem to have a permanent pastry chef on call  for afternoon tea (choux buns, lemon drizzle cake, shortbread biscuits (all made on the premises) They even do a special afternoon tea one afternoon a week, where all the ""ladies that lunch"" locally come and spend the afternoon , but we did not get the chance to sample this. Overall the warmth of the welcome enhanced what was already a lovely time in Dublin. Oh and the dart train to Tara street (central Dublin is a 2 min walk and 6 mins on train",5,2014,05,17
233,"Fabulous staff, breakfast and attention to details!","Our experience at Ariel House was fantastic.  They have such attention to detail besides being beautiful, clean and hospitable.  The staff went above and beyond to help us with making parking arrangements (can be challenging in Dublin!) so as not to interfere with the limited time we had to spend in their lovely city.  The breakfasts are amazing - all homemade pastries and they come out fresh from the oven.  The scones are to die for!  Then in the late afternoon/evening they put out even more goodies along with beverages to snack on as you come into the parlor.  We highly recommend.  Location is good as it is right on the train or bus line into the city or just a 15-20 min. walk into the city center.",5,2014,05,17
233,02 DUBLIN JULIO,Ariel house excellent staff  food and bed the same unfortunately the concert we went to Dublin for from blackpool was awful time to retire Julio cost us a lot of money was sad for him people were walking out halfway through  aww,5,2014,05,17
233,Nice B&B,"We stayed two nights here and found it to be a nice bed and breakfast style hotel. The bus from the airport stops close-by. Our room was clean, offered in-room tea and coffee. Housekeeping was a bit late cleaning, concierge pleasant and competent. The breakfast served in their dinning room offered varieties for every taste including Irish breakfast specialties . There is a nice common area where tea and coffee are available. Local newspapers are available and wifi is free. The area is laid back and a bit off center but for us it only meant a pleasant walk to all the Dublin attractions.",4,2014,05,11
233,Great hospitality and outstanding breakfast,"Justifies the high rating it gets with the most outstanding breakfast (selection of berries, choice of veg hot plates, cereals and breads in a lovely glasshouse). The Suites are the ones to go for- 4 posters, big bathrooms, seating area, chandeliers, etc. Lots of parking (and if it gets full they help you move the cars). The beverages and the selection of cakes in the living room was as good as it gets.  the entire team is very helpful and warm",5,2014,05,11
233,Impeccable Staff and Service,"I am a frequent traveller having been in Italy, Germany, Holland, Mexico, China, Canada, and all over the U.S. The hospitality and friendliness of the staff is second to none. Just to give you an idea...we had to be somewhere at a particular time and the taxi that the hotel called was running late so one of the male employees took it upon himself to run down the street and flag one down for us. Now that's SERVICE! The whole experience was like this from the waitstaff in the dining area, the friendly young men at the reception and I must shout out Deirdra whom is such a caring and helpful person and the manager of the hotel. Every request we had was met with an ""absolutely, right away"" with a genuine smile to go with their response. As others have said; fabulous breakfast and you can order whatever hotfood is on their menu from smoked salmon, to poached eggs with bacon, to fruit plates, to porridge, or pancakes and a buffet of fruits, cereals, yogurt, granola, brown bread, cheeses, and a variety of pastries and breads. Also, coffee, tea, or a variety of juices. The bed is very comfortable and our room 226 was very quiet. My only suggestion would be a bit more lighting in the room.  I recommend this hotel highly!!",5,2014,05,10
233,Warm and wonderful in Dublin,We stayed here for our first 2 days in Ireland and it was a great choice. It is close to transportation into the city center and in a very picturesque area. Our room was large and comfortable with a great bed. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. It was a great value for the area. I highly recommend this Guest Home.,5,2014,05,10
233,Best Value in Dublin!,"I cannot say enough good things about Ariel House. For starters, it's a beautiful property in a lovely location (yes, it's a 15 minute walk from Central Dublin, but it's a nice walk and Dublin is a very compact city). Our room was well-appointed and had a great view of the front gardens and the price was incredibly reasonable. Second, the breakfasts are phenomenal. I stayed at a lot of choice properties during the 3.5 weeks I spent in Ireland including Ashford Castle and Ballymaloe House but Ariel House offered the best breakfast by far. Amazing variety with wonderful waitstaff and expertly prepared food (that they'll customize for you - try mixing the smoked salmon with poached eggs, potato cakes and a bit of pan fried mushrooms). The staff here is extremely kind, helpful and attentive. Stay here if you can, you won't find a better value in Dublin.",5,2014,05,09
233,Wow!,"After a 0430 wake up call at home we arrived slightly jaded and early at Ariel House. I can honestly say I have never had such a lovely warm welcome in all my years of travelling.
Deirdre and Jessica made us feel right at home with a coffee and an impromptu breakfast that, in my opinion is up there with the best.
Everybody at Ariel house has a pride in working there and this shines through from the excellent concierge service ( yes, in a B and B!) to the restaurant. 
If you're visiting Dublin, Ariel House is the only place to stay!",5,2014,05,09
233,Wish I could score Ariel SIX!!,"This is quite simply the best guest home you could wish to stay in!
The accommodation is made up of three elegant linked properties in a very leafy, safe area, within close walking distance of transport into the city.
Our warm welcome by Deirdre was much appreciated, especially the offer of a cuppa after a fairly stressful journey!
Nothing is too much trouble for the professional, polite, cheery staff, must mention Jessica too for her friendly chat.
I rarely sleep well away from home, but the bed was so comfortable, and the room both quiet and cool.
Breakfast is a major hi light - all ingredients sourced locally - every ingredient absolutely delicious!
The great reviews speak for themselves - do book your stay here - you're in for a treat!",5,2014,05,09
233,Friendly and welcoming!,I can't say enough about the wonderful stay in Dublin at this B & B. We arrived from Canada after flying overnight and were exhausted. The room was ready and waiting. Great bathroom! Not so great carpeting but there were slippers. The next morning we awake to a full Irish Breakfast - try the black and white. The serving staff are especially courteous and friendly.  Would highly recommend staying here.,5,2014,05,07
233,Lovely Building. Great Location. Great Staff. Great Breakfast.,"We were looking for a place to stay in Dublin but did not want to stay right downtown. We booked a room in this wonderful old building in a nice neighbourhood. It has free parking, a big deal in Dublin hotels. The staff were very friendly and helpful with any request and gave great directions and help The room was stellar. Very beautiful. We got a good night sleep each night. The Ariel is about a 20 minute walk from downtown but is only 1 block from a Dart station that gets you there in minutes. 

The breakfast they served was incredible. There was so much choice and everything was delicious The service was quick and attentive. I have never given five stars to a guest house/B&B type accomodation before but this place had everything and was such a good value, I had to.",5,2014,05,05
233,Amazing guest house and staff,"I took my fiancé for his birthday to Dublin for a few days. We stayed here at Ariel house and we were not disappointed! 
It has remarkable reviews both on trip advisor and booking.com, so I decided this was the place to stay whilst in Dublin. 
When we arrived our room wasn't ready but we were offered by the lovely reception, tea and scones with jam..my goodness they were gorgeous yummy. 
The staff were very attentive without being intrusive and made us feel like part of an extended family. We were shown to our room which was the junior suite. My god this room is beautiful with antique furniture and huge four poster bed lush. 
The area is leafy, quiet and pleasant. 
We wanted to book tour bus tickets and reception offered to do this for is too which was much appreciated and helpful. We really could not ask for more from everyone at ariel house. Breakfasts we're wonderful, we had the buffet breakfast which is mostly cereals, breads, cheeses, little pastries and fruits. This was more than enough for us so cannot comment much on the cooked breakfasts as we did not try, although they looked yummy when we saw other guests orders. 
There was a Miscommunication between the taxi firm and there drivers, charging us when they knew they shouldn't have, but when we informed the reception they dealt with this extremely efficiently and professional and I must praise them and say just how impressed and grateful we were for this. They did not make you feel awkward at all, whereas some hotels/guest houses so not like complaints or going the extra mile, at ariel house they have everything down to the last Z. Totally amazing. 
We both would like to Thank you all at ariel House for all of your professional, kind and Welcoming experience. We will be back hopefully in the future. 
Once again thanks very much!! Hayley and nigel xx",5,2014,05,03
233,3 nights at the Ariel House,"We found the location was fairly close to restaurants and the bus service in Dublin which is the way for most people to travel.  The house is aged but updated and very nice and comfortable.  The buffet breakfast and to order breakfast menu was extensive and all the staff very helpful.  The only caveat would be if you use a wheelchair the access would be very hard. We would recommend the Ariel House over hotels in the city for its ""homeiness"" and excellent staff.",5,2014,05,02
233,"Lovely, quiet and child friendly",A warm welcome from the staff at this centrally located and beautifully decorated hotel. Fantastic breakfast with lots of choice including Irish Fry. Great start to our hols in ireland. Would fully recommend for couples and families alike.,5,2014,05,02
233,Great value,"Stayed here a few months ago .excellent place with a price to match.nothing was too much trouble,special mention for Deirdre .location is good near the dart but a little outside the city.good gastro pub nearby the chophouse.",5,2014,05,01
233,Perfect Dublin Hotel,"I have been meaning to write this review for weeks and finally made the time. We stayed in Ariel House on a Friday night a few months back and had such a wonderful experience from the one we arrived until the moment we left. We were greeted warmly on arrival and the young man at reception checked us in promptly and called a taxi to get us into the city centre because he could see were in a rush. As we waited for our taxi we were welcomed into the drawing room for coffee and cake which was a welcome pick-me-up after a long journey. 
On our accommodations: our room was at garden level and was large, comfortable and very clean. The bathroom had a powerful shower and large bath. Food: We stayed one night so we only got to sample Ariel house's breakfast. It was delicious! They have a very varied cold buffet as well as great choice in their selection of hot food. It was a very leisurely affair, despite the presence of children the dining room was quiet and calm. The staff were attentive but left us to relax and read the paper so we never felt rushed or harried.
Beautiful accommodations, delicious food, warm, friendly and professional staff as well as small finishing touches make Ariel House one of the best hotels we've visited in Ireland. We will return!",5,2014,04,24
233,Great breakfast,"I’d thoroughly recommend this guest house. It takes 30 minutes to reach via the airport coach, with the coach stop (Ballsbridge Hotel) only a 3 minute walk to Ariel House. It takes roughly 20 to 25 minutes to walk to the city centre, or a 10 Euro taxi if you prefer. Lansdowne Road train station is a 1 minute walk away, which is convenient if you are travelling further distances such as Howth. The bedrooms are a good size with high ceilings and a modern bathroom. Breakfast is superb and plentiful; you will not need lunch. The staff are friendly and so helpful.",4,2014,04,23
233,A fabulous little guest house,"We've just spent 3 nights in Ariel House and I have to say it was great overall.  The service was excellent with a great breakfast in the conservatory and the staff were very helpful and charming and willing to do anything they could to make our stay as good as it could be.  The rooms could do with a little updating (gaffer tape on the radiator in room 227), but, they were very clean and comfortable.   In terms of position it's very close to the Lansdowne Road stadium, a 15 minute walk to the museums and 5 mins from excellent restaurants in Ballsbridge.    I would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,04,21
233,Great stay,"Booked a twin room for three nights. We had room 235 on the front ground floor over looking the garden. The room was spacious and warm. The bed was a little hard for my liking but ok for a short trip, you can as others have said hear the floor boards above you but just take ear plugs!

It's a 30 min walk into Dublin at a slow pace. You can walk to O'Donoghues on Merrion Row in 20 mins, they play music there. The Searsons pub is nice too and they do cocktails. Highly recommended is Rolys Cafe walking distance, great food and to die for puddings (you can just go in and buy the cakes to take away too!).

We went to the races at Curragh on Sunday so skipped breakfast, reception booked us a taxi to get to the station and gave us a bag of booked goods for our journey which was a lovely gesture.

What really makes this a great B&b is the service and the fab breakfast. I travel a lot and this was up there in my top 3 (Milan has chocolate cake so that's hard to beat if you've a sweet tooth like me).

I would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,04,17
233,A great welcome to Ireland,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Ariel House for two nights in early April 2014.  The staff were absolutely wonderful and all the nicest people!  They were generous and spot on with recommendations and advice.  We were even upgraded to two rooms from a large single room for our family of four because they had some extra space that night.  The breakfasts were the best we had on our weeklong stay in Ireland; they set the bar high and our other hotels did not come close.  Great food, generous portions.  Try the breakfast berry granola yogurt.  The scones are fabulous!  I found this place to be an excellent bargain, in a great location - quiet, but walking distance to downtown.  My only complaint was the bathroom, could use some more towel hooks and more hot water.  We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others.",4,2014,04,15
233,"Not good in the first place, but they tried to fix the problems","We stayed 3 nights in a Standard Twin Room at Ariel Hotel. Unfortunately, we were not very lucky with the room we got. The wifi was not working there and therefore we had to go to the Drawing room to use our Smartphones. According to the Hotel they will get a better Wifi soon. Several things were not working in our room, but were fixed during the stay: The batch mirror light, screws standing out of the wall. We were also unlucky with the water - during our stay something was block and there was hardly any water. But we got a discount from the hotel for that, which was really fair. Anyhow the water pressure coming out of the shower was not powerful, but that is something we experienced at several B&Bs during our trip around ireland. 
Based on the good reviews I read here, it might depend on the room / building you stay. Based on the website and the reviews I expected a place to be fine in the first place and didn't need fixing. All in all this was the worst hotel of our trip, but in the end also the cheapest (With the discount we got the price performance was ok).",2,2014,04,14
233,Cozy stay and great service,"We took the airport bus to a stop nearby and walked to Ariel House. We arrived exhausted after flying in. Deirdre observed our arrival and helped us in, welcomed us, and gave us a place to rest as we waited for the room to be ready. Our bags were carried for us and delicious refreshments were delivered to us. How lovely!

We enjoyed our stay very much. Our room was lovely and comfortable. The friendly staff at all hours looked after our needs without hesitation--we really appreciated the young men who worked the night and early morning shifts. Thank you to all of them for looking after us so beautifully!!  

Breakfast was hearty and delicious. Service there was incredible. Tea and goodies were waiting for us every single day when we retuned to the hotel--and we were even given a pot of tea to take to the room with us. That was special.

The hotel is right next to the Dart, which takes you right down to the city center. Easy trip and nice transportation. We got around all over town all week from here with the Dart, walking (in a lovely, peaceful, Georgian neighborhood), the on/off bus, and then we only took a cab a couple times. When we did take a cab, the hotel called it for us and it was there in minutes. The hotel's location is just perfect.

The wi-fi was a headache the week we stayed, but maybe that was temporary.

Yes, the hotel is older and charming. Don't expect a brand new hotel. We enjoyed its unique ambiance. The staff in this older and smaller place went extra mile for us without batting an eye. We never had this kind of service in a new hotel...and we would stay here again on a return visit.
",4,2014,04,12
233,"Lovely, Lovely, Lovely","Our family of 6 stayed at the Ariel House during the St Patrick’s Day Weekend, what a fantastic B&B in Dublin. Deirdre and the rest of staff are amazing, extremely nice and helpful. Outstanding service.  We arrived early in the morning and they were very accommodating and offered us coffee and tea as we waited for the room keys (loved the very unique key holders).  We felt welcomed right away. 

We loved the location and the coziness feel of Ariel House.  Every night after exploring Dublin all day we used the parlor room in the front of house to relax and enjoy a nightcap.  Our rooms were comfortable, spotless and very nicely decorated.

Everything that is said about breakfast is true, WOW.  Between the six of us we tried everything on the breakfast menu and everything was outstanding.  Besides that the breakfast is yummy the service is impeccable.  

I would definitely recommend Ariel House and would love to stay here again if I am ever in Dublin.

Thanks Ariel House for making our first stop in Ireland fabulous.",5,2014,04,05
233,Nice Place - just a few small things..,"Hotel was nice - could use a few updates (bathroom in room 222).  Staff was friendly and helpful.  I don't base my stays on WIFI availability BUT the 'complimentary WIFI' was basically non-existent in the rooms.  Even in the downstairs Drawing Room - the network was hit or miss.  We were told there had been a recent upgrade but apparently it wasn't done properly.  The staff did not hesitate to offer us use of their office computer if needed.  Parking was a slight challenge but we were accommodated just fine. The restaurant was nice - good breakfast and staff. Quiet street at night, a few restaurants within walking distance but may want a cab if planning on going into City Centre.   I would stay again if the network issues were corrected.",4,2014,04,02
233,Excellent choice for Dublin,"We felt this was an excellent choice for our first visit to Dublin. We had a warm welcome on arrival where we were taken to the warm lounge for tea/coffee and refreshments. 

Free parking on site was available. The rooms were cosy. The breakfast was extremely good with plenty of options.

In terms of location, Ariel House is in Ballsbridge which seems to be a lovely suburb. It is a 25 minute flat walk to Trinity College and not much further to Grafton St and Temple Bar. We took a taxi back for approx 10 Euro. It is adjacent to the stadium which had a sold out event the night we were there. This closed nearby roads which meant our taxi could not take us right to the doorstep but it was only a few minutes walk. 

Would definitely stay here again if ever return to Dublin.",5,2014,04,02
233,Small hotel or big B&B,Great stay.  A little far from downtown but great upscale neighborhood clean bright room.  Great shower.  We were leaving early so they packed a breakfast to go.  Would stay there again.   A little far to walk downtown.  But still a great place ,5,2014,03,30
233,Best accommodation in Dublin,"If you want an excellent comfortable place to stay in Dublin Ariel House is the place for you. I stayed here with my husband in March and could not fault it. We arrived early, but it was no problem, we were provided with freshly baked cakes and coffee in the superb lounge. Our room was large with lovely high ceilings and big windows. 
Although it looks a little way out of the city the Dart rail system is two minuets walk away and for €3.80 return it brings the city within easy distance and no problem parking! So, close to city centre, free parking and quiet, everything just right.  
As for the facilities the breakfast is legendary !! Breakfast table generously supplied with freshly baked bread, pastries, cereal I could go on... The kitchen also offered a wide range of cooked items to order, full Irish, poached eggs and salmon etc etc. Afternoon tea with fresh cakes and tea was available all included in the price, I have been spoiled but how could I refuse??
The staff at Ariel house are so friendly they treated us like family, but quietly efficient. There is nothing I can think of that would improve my stay. If you are planning a trip to Dublin try to book into this hotel, you won't be disappointed",5,2014,03,27
233,One of our favourite hotel stays ever,"I chose Ariel House for our first visit to Dublin based on the great reviews and the location of the hotel suited our needs - far enough away from the centre to be quiet and allow us to experience other parts of Dublin, yet near enough to quickly get to the City Centre when we needed to.

We arrived a little earlier than we expected to, about an hour before check-in and so our room wasn't ready. No problem though, the lovely lady on reception offered to take our bags for us while we went in search of lunch and even suggested a few places for us to try in the local area.

Upon return, our room was ready and our bags had been placed in our room for us. The room was a complete surprise to us, it was so much more than we expected. It was more like a studio apartment than a hotel bedroom and came with bed, en-suite bathroom and lounge area. Very specious and clean and the bed and furniture were very comfortable.

Every morning at Breakfast, we were welcomed with tea, coffee and juice to start. There is an extensive breakfast menu, plus plenty of choice on the breakfast table also. I can definitely recommend the full Irish breakfast and the poached eggs and smoked salmon from the menu. The hotel also bakes its own bread, scones and cakes, all of which are delicious. The breakfast staff were brilliant, such an efficient yet friendly and personal service.

The hotel also provide afternoon tea or coffee and cakes and we were offered this on a number of occasions, regrettably we didn't take advantage of this as we were too busy exploring the city in the afternoon however we thought this a really nice touch and if the breakfast was anything to go by, I'm sure they were delicious. We made sure to take the hotel's recipe book away with us and can't wait to try out some of the recipe's.

For anyone concerned they may be a little far removed from the centre of Dublin, it is a pleasant 5 minute walk to the bus stop on Northumberland Road and about a 5-10 minute journey on the bus into the centre. We were never waiting more than 5 minutes for a bus to show. There is also the DART right next to the hotel which I believe would take you within a 5-10 minute walk of the centre.

The staff at the hotel couldn't do enough for us, they were so attentive, friendly and willing to help us or provide suggestions for things to do or places to eat. It was a completely pleasurable experience and after leaving Dublin and seeing all of it's sights, me and my girlfriend were in agreement that the one thing that made our holiday extra special was Ariel House. We can't wait to stay there again in the future.",5,2014,03,23
233,Could not be better!!!,"I stayed there between the 9th and the 13th of March 2014. This House is located in a quiet place, though next to the Aviva stadium so didn't experience match day. Quite close to the center of Dublin and with some very good place to eat near by.
Room was quite large with very high ceiling, bathroom, garden view, TV, free WiFi. Also free car park which is a premium in Dublin.
Staff extremely friendly and knowledgeable. 
The breakfast was very good and included!! I could not enjoy it before I left and guess what... they prepared one for me to take away!!!
I can't recommend this House enough !!!",5,2014,03,23
233,Simply elegant.,"From start to finish our stay here was fantastic. Complimentary Fresh coffee and cakes on arrival, a comfortable quiet room with a garden view and also a great view of The Aviva and the iconic Gasworks Building, free parking,friendly staff,perfect location for our visit to the O2 (15 minute walk). 
But the breakfast is the jewel in this crown. Wow. So efficient yet fresh and very high quality. 
If you don't book here you'll never know just how good it is.",5,2014,03,18
233,Can't recommend enough!,"We loved our stay at Ariel House! Beautiful Georgian building with very spacious rooms with big comfy four poster beds, views over the front gardens & tea & coffee facility's. Hotel is very clean and the breakfast is to die for with plenty of choice. Cereals, pastries, fruit, cooked breakfast, eggs, pancakes etc! Location is perfect, close enough for the city centre but still far enough to be away from the hustle and bustle of it all, the dart station is pretty much opposite the hotel and takes you straight into the city, or it took us around 30 minutes to walk. All of the staff were lovely, friendly & very helpful! Thank you for an amazing stay with our first visit to Dublin!! We will definitely be back :)",5,2014,03,17
233,"Great location, beautiful decor, polite staff","I stayed here back in October 2013 with my fiance for 3 days. We absolutely loved the place! Located in a quiet neighborhood, but literally a 5 min walk to the DART station which will take you practically anywhere you need to go. If you prefer the exercise you can walk to the large shopping areas as well, it only takes about 25-30 min. The room was clean and decorated very tastefully, with a high ceiling, huge armoire and a nice view of the stadium. Wi-fi was a little spotty but I believe it may have been our room's location (we were on the second floor, last room at the end of the hall). 

Breakfast every morning was a bit pricey but still delicious. Staff was extremely polite and refilled my tea often. There was a staff member at the front desk (I forget her name, unfortunately!) who we saw every day and was always very helpful, asking if we had a nice day out and if we needed anything. She gave us daily directions and drew helpful diagrams on our map. We would have been lost without her! 

Overall an amazing and cozy B&B, worth every penny you pay. I will be back to Dublin soon and look forward to staying at Ariel House again.",5,2014,03,15
233,Dublin's Finest.,"Third time to stay here and this place has become our only place to stay when in Dublin. Beautiful decor, ambiance and the finest breakfast one will ever find. Pancakes with streaky bacon and maple syrup to die for. Stayed in a suite (Yeats) I think. Will be back for 4th visit as soon as I can. Thanks folks, great to see service at its best.",5,2014,03,10
233,Fantastic Stay,"Just home from a stay at Ariel House, myself and friends were down to see beyonce in concert. I found this hotel on booking.com, and due to the price and reviews i thought i would give it a shot. I was not disappointed!
The hotel is stunning, quaint, cosy. If you like a modern hotel this is not for you. The bedrooms were spacious and warm. Beds were extremely comfortable the place was spotless. the bathroom looked brand new! there were 4 of us in 2 double beds and we had ample room. the breakfast on sunday morning was impeccable. the staff from check in to check had outstanding service, including the lady who managed/owned the place, she was lovely.
If youre going down for a rugby match it is definitely the place aviva stadium is right beside the hotel. 
I will definitely be staying here on my next dublin trip
well done ariel house!",5,2014,03,10
233,100m from the Aviva,"No better place to stay for watching the rugby 100m max from the Aviva.
Staff very welcoming, rooms very clean and comfortable, breakfast very good. Plenty of parking at both the front and rear of the building. Also very close to DART stop.",5,2014,03,10
233,Great experience,"A very elegant B&B not too far from city center and American embassy. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. The extremely low water pressure was the only drawback to the room. The staff was exceptionally helpful and accommodating. (The manager, who had errands to run, actually led me about 75% to the highway when I spent an hour driving in circles trying to find it.) I definitely enjoyed my time here.",4,2014,03,05
233,A pleasure,"A really cosy, chilled out getaway….very welcoming staff, who offered us tea/coffee and freshly baked treats on arrival….nice, comfortable, clean room….great location (about 15 min to the centre, in a lovely area of south Dublin - right beside the Aviva stadium)……and, the breakfast - WHOA! Absolutely fantastic! A great stay all-round, and real value for money. Will definitely",5,2014,02,26
233,Flawless,"My experience of accommodation in Dublin has been more bad than good over the years, indifferent and sometime unfriendly staff being a big issue as well as poor levels of upkeep in some premises, places that while not quite dirty were a bit on the shabby side for the want of a bit more attention.   
None of this applies to Ariel house. We went for a superior room, what we got was way above our expectations, an enormous room with a bay window, lots of period details and a huge four poster bed, I'd never slept in one before, I felt like I was on the set of Downton Abbey. The room was in the front of the house facing Landsdowne Road, I was concerned that it might be noisy but it wasn't, the curtains were so heavy they kept most of the sound out. Also as the road is closed regularly due the DART barriers, it's not quite as busy as you'd expect.
Friendly and helpful staff from start to finish and a fantastic breakfast with great attention to detail. The last time I stayed in Dublin we paid €120.00 a night for a room (no breakfast) which was was way below the level of quality of Ariel House where we paid €84.00 per night (Sunday & Monday). The next time I'm staying in Dublin, I wouldn't  consider anywhere else.",5,2014,02,25
233,"Great, comfortable hotel.","We stayed here for two nights in February. The hotel staff were all really helpful, friendly and welcoming. The location is good, out of the city centre, but within a 20 minute walk. There is a Dart railway within a hundred meters of the hotel and this goes straight to the city centre.
We had a large room at the front of the house, with a comfortable four poster bed, nice bathroom with a big bath and a separate shower. 
Everything was spotlessly clean.
Afternoon tea was available in the lounge, which is obviously very nice. The breakfast couldn't be better. We would certainly say worthy of awards.
All in all a very nice hotel, if we had a couple of suggestions, it would be that we paid for a premier room, bottled water and bath robes would have been a nice touch, and are certainly what you would expect of comparable hotels.",5,2014,02,22
233,Great place...but please fix your floorboards,"We stayed last weekend usually staying in Sandymount but fancying a change. Location great, we love the area and parking is a bonus. Lovely room spotlessly clean...but the floorboards were very noisy. Ok as we were on the reception floor...but at 1am in the morning when the people above us arrived back...yikes!! No sleep for us. Eventually nodded off when they went to bed. Pity as the bed was really comfy. Breakfast was beautiful, recommend the pancakes, shame we were so tired.
Maybe if we'd been on the top floor or annex it would've been ok. I understand this is an old house but if you can't sleep.....
Shame, as everything else, including staff, were fantastic.",3,2014,02,21
233,Outstanding service and the yummiest breakfast you'll ever eat!,"Just returned from a fantastic 2 night stay at Ariel House (18th-20th Feb). We arrived early, knowing our check-in was scheduled for 2pm but hoping to drop our bags down and head out. We certainly weren't expecting such a welcome after reading various reviews, describing the check in as 'efficient' rather than friendly. 

However, as soon as we stepped through the door we were made to feel unbelievably welcome. Our bags were immediately taken from our hands and popped into the luggage room and we were offered a table in the dining room straight away to sample the famous breakfast! We took up this offer without hesitation and sat down with a lovely cup of tea, freshly baked bread, granola, jams and chutneys as well as delicious poached eggs with crispy bacon and smoked salmon with potato cakes. The best welcome ever! We were then told they could have our room ready in 15 minutes, despite it only being 10am.

We decided to take a stroll and come back a little later anyway. The hotel is situated in the leafy suburb of Ballsbridge, literally right next to the giant Aviva stadium. It is a little far out from the central attractions of Dublin (a 30 minute walk...but I am a slow walker!). We found the best way to combat this was a 2 day 'hop on/off' Dublin bus ticket which can be taken from Merrion Square which is just a 10 minute walk from the hotel and takes you to all of the main attractions in Dublin.The train station is also a 2 minute walk from the hotel but we didn't actually use the service. We also got a taxi to Temple bar when heading out for the evening (about 8euros each way)

When we arrived back, the drawing room was full of trays of little cakes, scones, tea and coffee. A lovely little touch! Our room was lovely and spacious, perfect when returning after a long day of sightseeing.

What really makes this hotel is the service, nothing was too much bother for the staff we met during our stay. They gave us recommendations on where to dine and visit, booked taxis for us and even called the Aircoach company for us when we were unsure of where the stop was for our return journey! It really was top notch service and always with a smile! A perfect example amazing customer service.

To echo nearly every other review, you really need to try the breakfast too. We had breakfast every morning, it was too amazing to miss! The staff at breakfast were also lovely and friendly. 

I can see why people return here whenever they stay in Dublin, just like a home away from home. Amazing service in an elegant and traditional setting. Although a little far from the main central attractions, I would still recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin. Transport links are great and besides, the extra walking is a great way to see the whole of Dublin (a beautiful city!).",5,2014,02,21
233,The best service I've ever had!,"I took my parents to see Wicked in Dublin and I finally got the chance to stay at this top rated hotel. We arrived before check in and were asked if we'd like some tea before we went back out. We were served in the beautiful drawing room with tea coffee and home made scones, it was a very warm welcome! Later on in the night we were delighted to find even more treats laid out in drawing room which were free for guests.

Breakfast was a chocolate coated cherry on a sundae of surprises. I strongly advise you to take advantage of all food available in this hotel it is all mouth wateringly good!

My only small gripe were the beds, we booked two double rooms but the beds in both were two singles pushed together and separate sheets. I won't lie not having to fight for sheets was a nice change but it meant sleeping on one side or the other no middle ground due to the break in the beds.",4,2014,02,20
233,Wonderful family break in Dublin,Stayed here for 3 nights from 14th February as a party of 6 for a family celebration weekend. The hotel is in a great location and it was very easy to get the DART from Lansdowne Road to Tara Street for the city centre. The rooms were very good with all the amenities you would need and the breakfast choices and quality were fantastic. Can't praise the staff highly enough-their friendliness and attentiveness was outstanding. Thank you Ariel House-we look forward to coming back soon.,5,2014,02,18
233,excellent service and wonderful breakfast,this is a gem of a place . we stayed 2 nights whilst visiting Dublin for 6 nations rugby . stadium was a 2 minute walk --yet peaceful and quiet at ariel house .  The rooms were clean and nicely decorated . personally I would have liked some bottled water in the room and the pillows were a bit flat -- but that's personnel taste . I would  also have liked to have seen 4 poster rooms -just read in review but didn't get that option . the highlight was the breakfast -- the service was faultless and the choice and quality as good as any 5 star hotel . The homemade brown bread and scones were awesome . We will definitely return when we come back to Dublin .special mention should go to lady who looked after breakfast --anticipated every need and really made breakfast experience first class .,5,2014,02,11
233,"Elegant, welcoming - old world charm.","I have stayed dozens of times at Ariel House, so I've stayed in a variety of rooms. Every stay has been an absolute pleasure. Immaculately clean, cosy and welcoming. The staff are always impeccably well mannered and friendly. It's lovely to enjoy a glass of wine by the fire beside the grand piano and read a free paper. Even the most affordable rooms (which I normally opt for) have traditional features like antique furniture, heavy lined drapes, carved beds and damask bed throws. The breakfast is better than any four star hotel I've ever stayed in, hands down, and the train station is 60 seconds away. Having stayed in many of the more expensive hotels nearby I always prefer Ariel House.",5,2014,02,11
233,Great service and scrumptious breakfast,"The rooms are nice though there is evidence of wear and tear especially in the bathroom and this could do with an update. This is why it gets a 4 star and not a 5.

What's great about this place is the service. You really felt looked after. The breakfast was so yummy - lots of choice for everyone. The waitresses were exceptional. I didn't get their names but they deserve a shout out as they went out of their way to make sure we were well fed! It's also next to the AVIVA stadium and I really liked the location. It's far enough out that you get away from all the hustle of a city but you can get to the centre in about 15 minutes walk and there are some really nice restaurants not too far away and a train station a few minutes walk away. 

Would definitely recommend and would stay there again if I was going to Dublin. ",4,2014,02,07
233,Great service,"We were in Dublin for the 6 Nations and stayed 2 nights at the Ariel which we chose for its proximity to the Aviva. Our experience began before we'd even arrived in Ireland with a friendly 'courtesy' call from Dermot - a lovely touch. 
We were lucky enough to have our room upgraded and loved the extra space, the four poster and the enormous bathroom. Breakfast was as good as previous reviews have stated with the added bonus that our window table looked directly at the Aviva. The Ariel is close to the Dart station so Dublin City centre is 5 minutes away - allowing us to visit Trinity College, Dublin Castle etc. The staff are friendly and professional and we felt as if nothing was too much trouble. The only negative was the chandelier in our room shook every time the people upstairs walked across the floor, the beautiful bathroom would benefit from a blind or shutters at the window and the pillows were a little hard for my taste. All very minor points compared to the positives! Can't wait until the next Ireland v Scotland game in Dublin so we can visit the Ariel again. It thoroughly deserves its good reputation and rave reviews.",5,2014,02,04
233,Great place to stay!,"We stayed here for four nights, took a train tour, and then returned to stay a further 3 nights, so we had two different rooms.  We were absolutely delighted with everything!  Rooms were spotless, quiet and comfortable.  Staff were very helpful and courteous and the breakfasts couldn't have been better - a buffet with lots of selection, then a choice of hot breakfast.  DART line (rapid transit) just down the street, and we could walk downtown in about 30-40 minutes, or there were lots of buses.  There is a small commercial area about a 3-4 minute walk away that has restaurants and one or two pubs, but we found the large convenience/deli store there very handy for sandwiches, salads & fruit if you want a smaller meal.",5,2014,01,31
233,Excellent service and value,Room was basic but clean and comfortable. Service was excellent -all at a very good price. Breakfast very good and menu caters for all tastes. 30mins walk to centre of town or good transport links. Next door to Aviva stadium.,4,2014,01,27
233,Good!,"For our weekend in Dublin we chose this guesthouse. It has an impressive entrance with a lounge that offers a nice selection of tea, coffee and cakes. We had room 223, the room was spacious and clean. The furniture is quite old, many will like it others won't. Personally I prefer less vintage style. The sleep quality was quite good, the beds where comfortable. If you are not used to the city try to get one of the few rooms to the backside.
I would like to highlight the delicious breakfast, which has an extremly good variety.
The staff was nice and attentive.",4,2014,01,26
233,So - so with a great lounge,"Room 226
22 January

Reception seemed ok - not exactly warm but efficient.
Room 226 is facing the back. Very high ceilings and a bathroom that has been added into the original room. Tight squeeze in the bathroom but acceptable.

I found the room cold. Radiator is on flat out but is warm at the bottom and cold at the top. Clearly needs air venting. Not great when you wake up cold in the night.

The lights in the room are a touch difficult. There is no switch on the light so you must grope down at the wall to turn them off and it's them hard to find the switch in the dark.

Creaky floorboards in my room. Furniture that is dated or quaint - depends on your view.

The lounge was very nice and had a selection of coffee and cake available in the afternoon.

My price did not include breakfast so I cannot advise on that.

The lounge pulls the overall hotel up - but if this is really the 2nd best in Dublin - heaven knows what the other hotels are like!",3,2014,01,23
233,Lovely Hotel,"We had a lovely stay at Ariel House in November 2013, it is a beautiful period building and our room was very warm, clean and comfortable. 

The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful and the breakfast was delicious - tasted like all fresh and high-quality ingredients.

Ariel House is a little bit outside of the city, however it is located right next to the DART which was very regular and a really quick journey into the city centre. The DART also runs quite late into the evening which was handy. In addition, it was quite nice to head back to a quieter, leafy area of Dublin after busy days of sight seeing and walking around in the hustle bustle of the city!",5,2014,01,20
233,good but...,"firstly, this is a very nice B&B.  It is in Ballsbridge and whilst quite close to a pretty major road; it is mostly quiet.  I was on the entry level floor (2nd floor but really the floor that is the lobby floor) and although I heard noise from the floor above, otherwise, it was quiet.  Others have commented on the dated rooms but they are fine.  bed comfortable, shower and bath fine….nice touch on the Irish ""hand made"" toiletries. All of this was good.  However, and I hope the management does read this; you need to do something about the selection of TV channels.  The location of this B&B, close to firms and research/education offices suggest that folks might (like me) be coming to Dublin for business.  If this is the case, then what you really need is to be able to come back and watch something other than one of the 11 really poor channel selections.  It is not that costly to get better cable and you do need to listen to the reviewers earlier on this.  Yes, if you are here as a tourist, watching TV is not high on the list but Ariel House, if you want to get business travelers back, having decent channels to watch when you are not here to see Dublin is a good (smart) idea. For that reason, and a few other small issues, I doubt I would suggest this again--for business travelers-- given the choices in the area.  If this is not an issue, then apart from the noise factor (people above me were just really noisy), this was a fine choice.  One tip, on Shelburne Road (out the door, take a right, then a left and then walk straight) is a wine bar called French Paradox.  Very nice wine and you can get tapas like food.  Nice atmosphere, fine to go by yourself and wi-fi!",4,2014,01,16
233,Hidden Gem,"We visited Ariel House on a 2 night bed and breakfast basis. We were on a course in the IPA which is just across the road. The train station is right beside the hotel which makes it an ideal location if you want to go into the City Centre or other parts of Dublin.

Rooms are dated but they are so clean and the beds are so comfortable. At €40 per night each it was really good value.

Breakfast is the best thing about this hotel. So much choice and it is nice to stay somewhere where there are healthy options. We had the poached eggs and salmon and it was beautiful. 

There is a little tea room where they have afternoon tea for their guests which was lovely after a two hour drive.
I will definitely be bringing the family to stay.",4,2014,01,10
233,Great place to stay,"I was at this cosy bed and breakfast in Dublin for two nights. The staff are very friendly and the room I was given very peaceful and warm. It is located close to the train station into the centre, but is only a 20 min walk to Grafton Street. All in all i would highly recommend it. In the afternoon they provide tea and scones in the main reception area with the daily papers and comfy sofas. It is definitely value for money. It was 44 euros per night for a twim bedroom. Only issue I experienced is thatvthe hair dryer was not working but they soon provided me with a replacement one.",4,2014,01,08
233,Best hotel experience I've had in Ireland,"Located next to lansdowne rd stadium on the very quiet (stayed Saturday night) Lansdowne rd, we booked the hotel on the back of the reviews left here and it lived up to them all. Big rooms with huge character , comfy beds, nice bathroom, warm welcome for the kids aged 6,4 and 2. 

We had an early start the next day and the receptionist offered to have take away baggies arranged. Fresh brown soda bread jams butters, fresh fruit chopped small for the little ones, juice and banana bread - a 7 star take away breakfast 

Ariel house is leading the way in the finer details of customer service most hotels overlook. The best hotel experience I have had in Ireland hands down.",5,2014,01,06
233,A gem,"This little hotel offers 5 star service and great comfort in a slightly faded setting.  The hotel is clean as a whistle, though the decor of the rooms is a bit dated.  Look past it--the staff goes above and beyond and you'll forget all about it and get a good deal too.  A piano, newspapers, tea and cakes in the lounge.  Warm Irish hospitality.  What more do you really want?

The hotel is in a pretty neighborhood and well located for public transit.  There is some parking, but be advised, it's a little tight.

Best of all is the included breakfast.  It was absolutely delicious with a nice range of buffet and hot choices and set us up for the day.",5,2013,12,31
233,"Impeccable service, lovely quaint ambiance","Amazing service, the best at any hotel or lodgings we have ever had period.  Since we travel extensively and stay in many highly rated places that says a lot.  Rosie is a true gem and makes your stay here feel special.  They truly appreciate you staying with them. An example of the service - when we arrived we asked about getting some cokes and diet coke, but they don't have a machine or any on site.  While we were napping Rosie ran up to the nearest store and bought them and had them ready for us when we woke up.  We wanted to go to the Chop House for dinner and she called and even thou they were packed was able to find a time and table for us.  They set up a cab to pick us up to go shopping and kept updated on them running late and if it wasn't on time they would go out and flag one down. Plus they even refused tips they said that is part of the service they provide.   Are you kidding me?  That is service you can't find in the states.   Great breakfast with all the fixings and top service.  The sitting room had a beautiful Christmas tree fresh coffee and teas plus little desserts.  Our room Classic Georgian style very elegant and warm.
If you wish to pay for hotels who charge hundreds more and claim to have top service do so. But if you want a true gem in Dublin where you are treated like royalty without spending your royal assets off them Ariel House is where you need to stay.  Thanks for a great start to our Christmas holidays.",5,2013,12,23
233,Just such a great place to stay!,"We loved staying here!  The staff, our room, and the breakfast were all excellent!  I highly recommend this lovely place.  The staff went above and beyond to assist us and it is close enough to the city by train or car for most purposes, and very close to the stadium for those who enjoy their sporting events!  Nothing to say other than very positive remarks!",5,2013,12,20
233,Fantastic staff,"Staed here for 2 nights in November 2013. Fantastic staff who could not do enough for you. An added bonus was the afternoon tea in the drawing room. Great place - if you are going to Dublin, stay here!",5,2013,12,12
233,Fantastic breakfast,"Visited for 2 nights, which included a gig at the O2. As it turned out the O2 is only a 15minute walk away. 

Lovely staff, parking but not a lot so don't be late. Room was nice although we'd probably prefer one on ground or upper levels than lower ground floor. WiFi is only in public areas.

The lounge is a nice place to chill out for a while and has free coffee and afternoon cakes.

The very best thing though is the beautiful breakfast. Great choice of really delicious hot and cold local foods.

We'll go again!",5,2013,11,22
233,"Friendly, welcoming, lots of character....great place to stay","We arrived at 5:30am, tired and a bit wired from our first experience with left hand driving. We were welcomed like old friends with a pot of tea and a lovely nut bread. We knew our room would not be ready (scheduled check-in 3 pm) but it was clear we were welcome in the Drawing Room and for breakfast while we waited. They had the room ready by 11 am....just great. We stayed 3 nights, the room was very comfortable and breakfasts were great. We loved the ambiance. As well, it was a very short walk to the DART train into the center of Dublin but it was not a long walk to just walk into downtown Dublin (15 to 20 minute walk on lovely streets right into the center of things). We would certainly go back and stay there if in Dublin again and have no hesitation in recommending this lovely spot to others",5,2013,11,20
233,Free parking right?,"Better get there early, they've go like 6 spots sized for a mini, same for breakfast, show up late and you will wait for a table, other than that just OK, long walk to the pubs!  If you are ready for a walk there are a few nice pubs on the way to the center of town and museums, but don't start early museums open at 2:00, it is Ireland!",2,2013,11,17
233,Cozy hotel in great part of Dublin,"The Ariel house was a great introduction to Dublin. It was our first start on our trip in Ireland. The room was large enough for me, my wife and young daughter. Very clean and quiet. It had great tea making facilities and was a close walk to the city and to places around the Ballsbridge area. We tried the breakfast one day and it was great. Well recommended. 
The staff were very helpful and did everything they could to welcome us. Unless you need to be in the city proper, this would be great for any stay, personal or business.",4,2013,11,12
233,Excellent Guest House; Brilliant Location - Definitely recommend,"Fantastic location & beautiful Guest House.  Receptionist was extremely friendly and check-in etc was extremely efficient.  Parking is a bit tight outside the front of the property - understand there is additional parking around the back.   Really nice room; comfortable bed and nice en-suite.  Place is quite spread out with plenty of stairs so if you struggle with stairs, make sure to mention it when booking so that you get a room close to reception area..  Beautiful library/sitting room off reception with tea/coffee/scones etc - really lovely touch.  I didn't have time for breakfast unfortunately but from a quick chat with one of the other guests when checking out, they were full of praise !... Will certainly stay again as great value in this location; close to the dart for an easy spin into town and taxi fare home was only €7..",5,2013,11,11
233,"Excellent breakfast, service and value","I stayed in Ariel House for 10 days and I would like to appreciate very good service, helpful, professional and friendly staff, excellent breakfast, cakes and coffee in the afternoon. The advantage of this guest house is a good location, near Aviva stadium and Lansdowne Dart station, but only cca 20 min. walk from town centre and 10 min. to the beach. The house is very nice, old, in Gregorian style, but comfortable and very quiet. If you need good accommodation, with excellent service (without extra facilities) and quiet place, I can advice Ariel House very strongly.",5,2013,11,08
233,Lovely place with the friendlies staff I've ever met!,"I was looking for a nice place for my brother and me for a weekend in Dublin in November. After doing my research on Trip Advisor I decided to book a room at the Ariel House (even though some of the reviews  were negative, I decided to believe the positive ones and the information on the homepage of the hotel). And we didn't regret our decision at all!

Ariel House is a lovely place south-east of the city center of Dublin (only 3 stops with the DART train to TARA Station which is around the corner from Trinity College).

The house is lovely and charming, the staff (every one of them) was the lovliest staff I ever encountered on any of my many travels! Everybody was friendly all the time and did everything to make us feel comfortable and welcome. 

When arriving in the early evening, I learned from a letter in my room that due to water restrictions in Dublin City Center, the water supply will be turned off from 8pm to 7 am in the mornings. Quite a nuisance but  the hotel couldn't do anything against it (other than offer bottled waters to the guests to brush their teeth etc.).
When our water supply was not back at 9am though, I asked the hotel for help (since we did not want to lose half a day because we had to wait in the room to shower). They cleaned another room for us where we could shower and offered that we could move there since the water supply started earlier than in our room (I did not quite understand why but we chose to switch rooms).

Our first room (232) was quite dark, the second room (235) was light and facing the garden / street (but it was not noisy) so if you have the chance to choose between those two pick the latter (both are Supreme Twin Rooms). The bathroom in the first room was like a small corridor with bad lighting, we preferred the more spacious second bathroom. WiFi connection in 232 is horrible (breaks down every 15 minutes) but perfectly fine in 235.

The furniture in the hotel and in the rooms is nicely picked (due to old age the cupboard opened not so easily). Everything was very clean.

The award winning breakfast was delicious (only flaw: no fresh orange juice but bottled one). They even brought me cream cheese on our second day there since was looking for it on our first day to put it on my scone - they especially gave me a bowl of cream cheese the next day (which I shared with my table neighbours of course who glanced at it from the corner of their eyes). Like I said, the staff really made everyhing to feel us very welcome and comfortable.

Just around the corner there's the DART train station (3 stops to city center) and 3 bus lines. The DART however only leaves every 15-20 minutes but it was ok.

Since we had tickets for a show at the O2 we could walk there (20-25 minutes) which was perfect for us!

Here's a summary of the PROs and CONs:

PROs:
++ loveliest staff ever - from manager to waitress to chamber maid to front desk!
++ quiet location but with good connection to the city
++ free WiFi (not good in every room though - 232 has almost no signal!)
++ free coffee / tea in room
++ good mattress / selection of cushions
++ clean rooms 

CONs
-- WiFi in room 232 was so bad the connection broke down every 15 minutes (235 was good)
-- no safe / deposit box in room for valuables
-- no pen / paper in room
-- no elevator, we had to carry the luggage a few narrow staircases (so people with disabilities might not be able to stay here)

The issue with the water supply was quite a nuisance but nothing the hotel was to blame for.

If we return to Dublin, I would book the Ariel House again any time!",5,2013,11,08
233,Wonderful Stay and Staff!,"My husband and I stayed at the Ariel House for a few days while visiting Dublin. From the second we walked in the door we had nothing but great hospitality and service. The staff went above and beyond to accommodate us. 

The location is great. It's far enough from the city center to actually be quiet, and still close enough to everything. 

The beds are great and the rooms are clean. The house is very charming.

I can't recommend the Ariel House enough!",5,2013,11,06
233,Lovely hotel,"I've not visited this Hotel in 2005 , it's still excellent service ..rooms are immaculate , friendly helpful staff and wonderful breakfast !! 
The hotel is in an excellent location , quiet but near to landsdowne dart station , with easy access to all the main attractions and dublin centre .
I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else !!!",5,2013,11,06
233,Ariel House - Oct. 2013,"Stayed here twice.  A real find.  Top-notch very professional and friendly staff, beautiful property, great breakfast,cake in the afternoon, in a nice neighborhood a 20-minute walk from the main sights, with good pubs nearby.",5,2013,11,03
233,Simple comfortable rooms; Over-the-top incredible breakfast,"This is a great place to stay in Dublin. The rooms are simple but the building is charming. The breakfast, as stated in the title, was simple incredible. I don't usually like breakfast but everything was so delicious I could have stayed all day. The staff was welcoming and helpful. And delicious tea and cookies awaited in the ""living room"" when we returned in the evening. It's an easy walk to the more central touristy area, but in a quiet neighborhood itself. I would certainly return.",4,2013,11,03
233,Great start to our Ireland Trip,"This was our first trip to Ireland and this was a great place to start the trip. It is about a 15 minute walk to where the tour buses are and easily access town.  Nice quaint neighborhood, very safe and a short walk to the train (although we did not use it).  The breakfast was superior and the staff was so helpful in direction, conversation about the area and helping me get through some issues with the credit card when it was time to leave.   Minor issue on the water pressure in he shower (low), but would not keep us from using Ariel house again next time we visit.    BTW, Ireland in October is super and the prices are exceptional.",4,2013,11,02
233,I must have stayed at a different place,"If you like old, creaky, funky, accommodations, this one is for you. After staying at several of Irelands best B&B's, this place was a real disappointment. Thank goodness Dublin is full of fun and we only needed the room to lay our weary heads.   

First, the staff, while not rude, were not as friendly as we expected. More like indifferent American service as opposed to the warm and friendly Irish we became accustomed to.  Second, the facility was very, very aged. The furniture in the sitting room was very worn out and needed to be replaced. Not very inviting to the point of us not really wanting to sit down. Our room was filled with old, worn out furniture, creaky floor boards and the bed was uncomfortable and small.  A double bed for two  adults. The bathroom was cramped and I have never seen a shower set up like this one.  Finally, don't stay here if you can't walk up numerous steps carrying baggage. The staff helped us with our bags, which was appreciated, but it was still a chore to lug our bags up 10-15 steps to get to the lobby then another set to get to the second floor. 

This place was barely acceptable and didn't really dampen our spirits, but it is not a good value.",2,2013,10,29
233,I think I gained weight from the delicious breakfast options.,"Quaint, tree lined neighborhood.

Charming rooms, clean, quiet, great service, convenient to metro, good internet, free parking.

Wonderfully delicious breakfast options.

Only negative our room seemed a little small.",5,2013,10,27
233,Best Service Ever!,"We recently traveled to Ireland and booked this B&B based on the excellent Tripadvisor reviews and weren't disappointed.  On the day prior to our arrival my wife injured her leg and ended up with a leg cast and crutches.  We contacted Ariel House late in the evening and explained we would only be able to stay one night instead of three because of a change in plans to come home early.  I was advised that there was no problem cancelling the additional 2 nights and that they would make special arrangements for a ground floor room.  Upon arrival they opened a special service door on the ground floor to let my wife avoid stairs and helped us into our room. Then they brought us a complementary tray with two pots of hot tea, cream & sugar, fresh scones, and cookies. The room was clean and comfortable.  The bathroom featured a sink faucet with a single spout for hot & cold water (the first we saw in Ireland) rather than separate hot & cold water faucets.  Upon request they made reservations for us to attend an Irish music & dance dinner show that evening and made the taxi arrangements as well.  The following morning before departure to the airport they brought 3 trays of food for our breakfast to our room.  We would definitely stay here again!",5,2013,10,24
233,Uncomfortable beds in an otherwise very good hotel,"There were many things I liked about Ariel House, but if I returned to Dublin I would try another place for one reason – the beds were very uncomfortable. We stayed two nights but after only one night both my husband and I were complaining about aching backs. We stayed in 3 B&B’s, a guesthouse and a hotel prior to Ariel House with no problem with the beds.  Also they use heavy bedspreads rather than easily washable duvets with covers like most of the other places we stayed. The duvets just seem more hygienic to me.

Beds aside, the room was spacious and comfortable with a decent view of the neighborhood. The furniture was attractive and the ceilings were high. The bath was clean and a good size. We needed to call the front desk to figure out how to work the shower but it worked well once that was sorted.

The breakfast was terrific and I was sorry to only be able to indulge one day. And their crispy bacon really is crispy. Wish I’d know that. I’d started passing on bacon since it is usually not cooked as crisply as I like.  Good service, a varied and high quality buffet in addition to the entrée menu was accompanied by delicious coffee.  The breakfast room is sunny and nicely appointed.  There is also a lounge near the entryway. In the afternoons a selection of pastries and coffee is set out. Tea can be ordered.  

The front desk was efficient and called a (punctual) cab to take us to the airport. My booking and confirmation emails were promptly answered.  The Wifi worked but was slow. Finally, there is a train station very close that will get you into the city center in a few stops, so the location away from the tourist attractions is not an issue.",3,2013,10,24
233,Great little B&B,"This is a great little B&B a block away from the metro station and close to the city center. Built in the 1850's and has a classic Euro feel. I spent a night with my daughter while she was on a fall college break and we were traveling Europe for two weeks, we wish we stayed a couple of more days. Great service, super clean, really nice traditional breakfast, very quiet. Small rooms by US standards but found that to be very typical while traveling in in all of Europe",5,2013,10,23
233,Lovely Hotel,"I chose this hotel based on the reviews I had read by other guests at the hotel and I wasn't let down. This is a great hotel. Reception were very friendly and made us feel welcome immediately. We arrived quite early and they allowed us to put our bags in a secure room and we headed into the centre. 
The room we had was lovely and very clean. It seemed like a King sized bed, had a shower, tv, a couple of chairs and free wi-fi. You can walk into the centre, it is roughly 25 mins, or there is a train station just to the left of the hotel which is very handy, although we didnt notice until the last day. It's only around 2 euros each and takes 5 mins or so. 
The breakfast is very nice, with a wide selection and the staff there were also very friendly and helpful. There are many bars that do an Irish Breakfast if you choose to wander, such as Searsons, which you can find if you just walk up Lansdowne Road towards the centre. There are many, many restaurants and bars, so if you want to go for a drink and food, you won't have to look far. If you like a lot of atmosphere and live music, then you have to visit Temple bar. 
We also enjoyed the Guinness Storehouse and the Viking Splash tour. 
All in all, the stay was fantastic, I will be returning to Dublin and would certainly return to this hotel.",5,2013,10,23
233,Best Breakfast!!,"This was our first stop on our 11 day trip across Ireland.  The hotel was beautiful, the staff was wonderful, and the breakfast was amazing.  I still dream about the pears infused with orange and their banana bread!  What a great first impression!",5,2013,10,22
233,"Very Nice Stay, Excellent Value","We stayed at Ariel House for three nights at the beginning of our trip to Ireland.  It is in a great location that is quiet and just a half block from the DART station.  It was easy access to City Centre without all of the bustle, high prices and noise.  Our twin room was somewhat small, but nicely appointed and quite suitable.  The hotel is a combination of two or three adjacent houses that have been attached via hallways, which added to its charm.  The main sitting room is nicely appointed and even has a grand piano.  It was always stocked with coffee, tea, ice water and fresh baked goods and tea biscuits.  The dining room had a lovely view of the garden.  There was a buffet with a variety of cereals, fruits, cheeses and brown bread.  I was consistent with ordering the Irish breakfast and enjoyed each one, including the black pudding.  Their rashers, sausage and white pudding were very good and I definitely liked the toasted brown bread.  I would wholeheartedly recommend Ariel House and will stay there again when we return to Dublin.",5,2013,10,21
233,Loved It!,"Our room was on the second floor and was large and beautifully decorated.  The location was perfect for us - a block away from the city train stop and a pleasant 10-20 minute walk to restaurants and bars.  The staff were very friendly and accommodating and the breakfast was fantastic. When you book, make sure to request a room that is not on the ground floor (basement level).  
Our favourite pub was Doheny & Nesbitt at 4-5 Lower Baggot St. with Joe, the bartender.",5,2013,10,20
233,Wonderful B&B experience,"Located in a leafy residential section of the city, Ariel House offers a welcoming base to explore the city.  Although it is not located in the heart of the city, it's a pleasant 15-20 minute walk into the tourist center, and there is a decent selection of restaurants 2-3 blocks away, good public transportation (bus stop 1 block away, DARt train station at end of block), quiet sleep, and free parking!!

The bedrooms and bathrooms are clean, but nothing extraordinary, and the carpeting is getting a little tired. What makes Ariel House special are the people and their efforts to make your stay special.  The staff is super welcoming and goes out of their way to answer your questions and provide help.  Tea with freshly baked banana bread and scones is laid out in the welcoming drawing room and available until the wee hours of the night.  The breakfast is a cornucopia of freshly baked goods, plus cooked to order dishes (porridge, pancakes, smoked salmon, eggs benedict...). Deirdre spent 1/2 hour (during a busy time) helping us plan the rest of our week in Ireland and helping us make reservations across the island.

Overall, a wonderful introduction to Dublin & Ireland",5,2013,10,19
233,Irish Hospitality at it's Finest,"We rolled into Ariel House at 6:15 am on a Monday morning, fresh off a sleepless flight from Boston. My first Left side of the road driving adventure didn't go super well, but we made it. We we were super early and had only asked to store our bags, we were invited to relax in the lounge until 8, when things opened, it was with great surprise and pleasure that Deirdre informed us she found us a bed. We slept until noon and had a wonderful day all thanks to that over and above gesture. On our second night we got upgraded to a Jr. SWEET (suite) only word for it is WOW. You should stay here, also have great breakfast, awesome scones and locally sourced and traceable food. Jessica at Breakfast was super nice.",5,2013,10,17
233,Quaint and charming stay option,"On our girls trip around Ireland, this was our first stop. We booked two twin rooms at a decent price and it included a hot Irish breakfast. The breakfast was amazing – order the pancakes.  The house is located about a 20 minute walk from Dublin city center which we walked all over after we parked our car in the front - included. (Driving on the left side takes a bit used too – and parking in the city difficult) Staff was very pleasant. They booked our 2-day double deck tour bus which is highly recommended and useful. At night, we would take a taxi from Temple Bar and Dame Lane area (from the pubs) approximately 8 euros each way (which divided by 4 girls is not too bad and cheaper than taking the train). The house is beautiful and quaint. The room was adequate – clean and comfy beds. I recommend this hotel as a base in the city.",4,2013,10,16
233,Real irish hospitality,"My wife and I have just returned from a 2 night stay at this lovely property. Superb breakfast. Leafy suburb location, yet only 20 minutes into the City Centre.
Loved it,when seeing that we had colds the waitress offered us both hot honey and lemon. I also returned late one night with a takeaway and rather than insisting I eat it outside, the night porter actually laid a table for me. Proper service.",5,2013,10,14
233,A Warm Welcome in Dublin,"Everything about Ariel House was fine, but two things were outstanding. The staff is superb, welcoming, informative and always happy to help. They made our stay very special. And then the Irish Breakfast was amazing. All items from porridge to salmon to the full Irish were great. Good location. Nicely decorated. Not fancy, but excellent value for money.",4,2013,10,11
233,Overall pleasing,"Good location if you are happy to walk in ,also could bus or taxi in to centre. Peaceful and parking in grounds. However the quilt and pillows although clean were tired and had lost all bounce. Would stay again .",4,2013,10,09
233,Cant wait to go back,"You know that you have arrived in the right place if the face that greets you smiles &asks you how your travel was. The rooms are large and so are the bathrooms and immaculate. Service is to the tee and whatever you want you will get.  The beds were great as were the pillows and the food very good. The best thing however is the people working there, always friendly, helpful and in for a chat. I would definitely come back here. .",5,2013,10,08
233,What a Magical way to begin a Memorable first time in Ireland,"Straight from the plane (overnight from Hong Kong to Heathrow and onto Dublin) and we arrived way, way earlier than expected on the doorstop of Ariel House. At 9am we received THE warmest welcome from Diedre at reception who ushered us into the gorgeous parlour and the most comfortable lounge chairs. There was not a sign of the establishment being in any way inconvenienced or flustered by our super early arrival. In fact the staff could not have made our welcome more inviting with the beautiful Jess offering and serving us 'fresh from the oven' scones, jam with double cream closely followed by home baked banana bread, a pot of piping hot tea and fresh coffee exactly to my husband's taste. All of this served up with the most DELIGHTFULLY charming Irish manner. Next we were welcomed by Ewa (pronounced Eva) as she professionally attended to her housekeeping duties and then kind offers of assistance with directions for later in the day from Eoin (pronounced Owen) as our room was prepared. Early access to our room, a quick unpack, shower to refresh and we were set to not waste a minute of our time in Dublin. Ariel House was EVERYTHING and much much more than what we had read about this treasure on Trip Advisor. Our room was very well appointed, its decoration particularly charming and the bed so comfortable!! If that wasn't enough, each morning the breakfast was an absolute HIGHLIGHT. DELICIOUS, so much choice and with such lovely touches and attention to detail in its presentation. Compliments to the chef! Jess and Myron's  wonderfully professional and yet friendly service further enhanced our experience.The ease, calm and charm with which everything is done for you makes Ariel House an absolute definite and a pleasure to recommend to others. Apologies to other Ariel House staff who also contributed to our wonderful stay and whose names I didn't note. Also to note: So easy to get to and from by bus. We took Airport Express Bus from airport to the city and then you can catch either Bus 4 or 7 from O'Connell Street and its less than (an easy) 5 minute walk from bus stop to Ariel House. Buses from the city run until 11:30pm and they come so frequently or you can take a cab (only 5 Euro fare) to or from the city. Thanks Ariel House, everything was GRAND!! We'll most definitely be back, looking forward to seeing you all again and am more than happy to spread the word about the gem that you are! PS They did our laundry at no charge. On our first night we were so taken with the amazing comedy show that we'd discovered in the city that we missed getting any dinner. At Midnight, Ariel House staff upon hearing this, organised a delicious platter of food to be delivered to our room!! WOW!! Would love to share photos of this amazing place but we left our camera in Germany and it is on its way back to us as I type.",5,2013,10,08
233,One of the very best,"My wife & I spent 3 nights at Ariel House in Dublin in early September'13.This place has it all... beautifully decorated, professional,friendly & helpful staff & just up the road from the train ( the Dart) that takes you into the centre of Dublin in a matter of a few stops.
The breakfast room is beautifully set out with cereals,fruit,coffee etc. & a menu for a hearty hot  & delicious Irish breakfast.
After a hard day's walk around Dublin you can come back & sit & relax in the chairs of the plush common room with fresh coffee or tea & cakes & read the daily newspapers provided.
Ariel House has got it right,I would not hesitate to stay here again....full marks.",5,2013,10,06
233,Place to Relax,"Stayed here for four nights whilst in Dublin for a family party.  Lovely quiet room overlooking garden with comfortable beds.  Best breakfast we have ever had with great choice on the menu.
Couple of minutes walk to Dart station which takes you into centre of city.  Some good restaurants within walking distance.  The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful.  We will certainly be back.",5,2013,10,03
233,Beautifully appointed rooms with old world character and memorable service,We loved our stay.  It was one of the prettiest rooms we've ever stayed in. Gorgeous antique furniture completed its charm.  Could not speak highly enough of the staff - they were extremely helpful and obliging with any requests or questions - nothing was ever too much trouble.  Breakfast was amazing with service to match.  It made our stay in Dublin so memorable.  There are several lovely restaurants within walking distance and also a small convenience store.  ,5,2013,10,02
233,The very best of Irish hospitality,"Stayed at Ariel when I was in Dublin for business...so in writing this I'm basing it on having stayed in very high end hotels and a need to get into and out of the city quickly and effeciently.

Its very easy to get downtown - literally steps from the train station that wisks you into the centre of Dublin. And if you're in Dublin for a game at Lansdowne Road, you'd be mad not to stay here (if you can get in). I heard the train a couple of times in my room but any noise from it is killed off by the houses that follow the tracks so don't worry about noise.

Think of Ariel as a very large bed and breakfast...that's probably the way I'd describe it to friends.  The rooms are perfectly fine: clean, all the usual facilities and a decent size.  Don't expect a Hilton / Marriott kind of cookie-cuttter room...each has its own character.

Where Ariel excels is the service of the staff (who make the service you get at way more expensive hotels look amateurish) and the breakfast. Its quite possibly the best breakfast I've ever had. And its like that every day.

So if you're in Dublin,  want a fantastic Irish welcome, a comfy place to be based while you explore the city and a start to every day that you're not gonna forget just book here. I simply cannot recommend it highly enough.",5,2013,10,01
233,The perfect bookend for our trip,"We stayed at Ariel House based on Trip Advisor rankings of Dublin lodgings--two nights at the beginning of the trip and one night at the end.  We loved it!  The staff was welcoming and helpful and friendly, breakfasts were amazing, beds comfortable, shower hot, linens clean and white, etc. etc.  Also, it's within an easy walk of downtown.  We could not have been more pleased.

233,A Gem,"We stayed at Ariel house for 4 days on a recent trip to UK. Everything was wonderful from the welcome, to the afternoon tea, the amazing breakfasts and the comfortable room. We had requested an upgrade which was well worth the extra few $. The neighbourhood was safe, close to good restaurants and an excellent base from which to explore. the staff were helpful and pleasant and their restaurant recommendations were good. We highly recommend this inn. It wa a bit noisy being right on the street but not too bad.",5,2013,09,29
233,Lovely place to stay,Spent 3 nights in the city and could not have stayed any where better. Staff were lovely. The room was huge and breakfast tasty. The coffee was so nice I could have polished off the whole jug on my own. Will definitely be back. ,5,2013,09,27
233,Irish hospitality at its best!,"I can't say enough wonderful things about Ariel House. We stayed for 2 nights and it was by far the nicest hotel we stayed in. They gave us an upgrade when they found out we were on our honeymoon. We had a beautiful suite with a 4 poster bed and a huge bathroom with a separate tub. Our flight left early in the morning and they put together 2 bags of breakfast food for us to eat at the airport, since we were missing breakfast- fresh fruit cups, scones, bread, etc. It was delicious! Every night they left out different goodies- brownies, cakes, coffee, tea. Easy access to the train. Beautiful modern room. Top notch service. You can't find a cleaner place, which is most important on my list! And the breakfast is more of a gourmet style breakfast that you won't find anywhere else. I would absolutely stay here again!!!!!",5,2013,09,27
233,A notch above the rest,"This establishment can't be faulted. 

Our delight commenced during the booking process, when every effort was made to accommodate our needs. Enquiries about dining options for a birthday were met with a number of recommendations. When we indicated one sounded nice, it was booked even though we hadn't specifically asked for.

We arrived early, and our room wasn't quite ready, but this didn't phase the staff...they ushered us into the drawing room, and supplied us with scones, tea and drinks. We were made to feel very welcome.

The room was a delight...a complementary upgrade when we asked, and huge...with a wonderful bed, AND importantly opening windows...nice big ones that slide up, allowing us to invite the cool evening air into our room. We were at the front of the House so we could watch the to-ing and fro-ing of the locals.

Breakfast was superb...and generally all the staff gave 150% to looking after the guests.

It should be noted that this really is a type of guesthouse and NOT a hotel. So don't expect airtight and soundproof rooms. You may hear comings and goings but this adds to the atmosphere. The social areas of breakfast room and drawing room really foster a great interaction amongst guests. Before long, you seem to have life long friends (both guests and staff).

An experience like this doesn't come along often, and should be grabbed with both hands.",5,2013,09,25
233,welcome dublin," the property is situated in landsdowne road and is very close to the arriva stadium and the dart railway station.the hotel is very impressive and we had a very comfortable room , great breakfast with excellent service. 
      
      ",5,2013,09,25
233,Lovely Experience,"We have just returned from this hotel, we went up to see a concert in Dublin.  First impressions were lovely the outside of this large victorian style house, very clean and we got a warm welcome from the the staff, which is always so important in my book. It is very central to town and just a short taxi drive costing about €10.00.The room itself was nice, it was down in the basement of the building, personally I would have preferred to be upstairs with more light and I don't know what the rooms look like, but I would suspect they may have been more plush,but am only guessing they might have been.Our room was ok, a bit dark, it was facing the gardens, but if it was a cold winters day, it may a felt a bit cold, saying all that the room was very clean, didn't have any body lotion, which was strange, but had tea/coffee facility and all the rest.
The breakfast in the morning had a wide choice and it was all home made, and all very delicious and were we full when leaving. The dinning room is small and they seem to be very busy, but the surroundings were lovely, and the breakfast staff were very helpful and polite.
So it was a lovely experience to stay at this hotel.  We really had a lovely weekend and enjoy it no end, and yes I would recommend this to all travellers.",5,2013,09,25
233,Extraordinary service!,"A perfect little getaway if you don't want to stay in the absolute centre of Dublin, but still close enough to walk. The best service you can ever imagine for a small place like this! I've nothing bad at all to say about Ariel. ",5,2013,09,24
233,"Beautiful looking hotel, comfortable stay!","First of all I would like to say that the Hotel looks beautiful and the rooms with some quaint, old school touches to the decor seem inviting and comfortable. Very spacious as well. The staff is efficient and friendly as well and will help out to sort any of your requests. The hotel is not exactly in the center of the city although the DART station is literally a 2 minute walk away and you can get into the city in about 10 minutes. The airport is about half an hour away. All in all great looking hotel, comfortable rooms , helpful staff and in a nice area. Nothing mind blowing mind you but definitely worth the money.",4,2013,09,23
233,"Nice, cosy hotel","We stayed at Ariel House for 2 nights very recently. The hotel is about 15-20 mins away from the city center, but there's a DART station literally a stone's throw away. It costs about EUR 3.5-4 for a return ticket to the city center, or a 15-min walk when it isn't raining, so that's really not a concern. The hotel is a charming red-bricked house located in a lovely neighbourhood. We were welcomed by Dierdre after 10pm at night. She showed us to our cozy room and invited us down for a coffee. The room was spacious and absolutely lovely with an old-world charm. The bathroom is very spacious. We didn't opt for the breakfast, but reading from the other reviews, looks like a miss on our part. The staff are very helpful with anything you need - be it directions, advice on what to see, cabs to the airport, you name it. I'll definitely recommend Ariel House to anyone who is looking to book a hotel in Dublin.",4,2013,09,23
233,Possibly the best Guest House in Dublin,"My wife and I were in town to see Fleetwood Mac in concert 21 September and arrived mid-morning before our room was available. Nice quiet well-to-do suburb of Dublin less than 10 mins by bus from the centre, in the shadow of Croke Park. We were invited into the drawing room for tea and no sooner had it arrived than we were informed that our room was ready and our cases already taken up. Beautifully appointed room, fabulous breakfast,great complimentary home made afternoon tea every day, brilliantly friendly, helpful staff. Room only was prepaid for two nights, and no debit/credit card swipe on check in, in case we ""did a runner"" without paying for breakfast! How refreshing. Highly recommended and will definitely stay here again when next in the fair city.",5,2013,09,23
233,"Great location, but not really a B&B","This was more of a small hotel that serves an excellent breakfast. This was our first stop on our two week stay so we learned quickly that the Irish time frame is different than the one we use. It seems like everything was ten minutes away, when in actuality it would be advisable to double whatever they say. Most everything is walkable including several decent restaurants in Ballsbridge. Try Rafferty's pub, but not Al Boschetto. As was previously mentioned, it is right near the Avia Stadium and we were there when Ireland played Sweden in a World Cup qualifying match. The festivities just enhanced our experience. The Dart is very close and 2 euros will get you to the Temple Bar area. I would recommend you spend a day doing the Wicklow, Glendaloch, and Killkenny tour. Well worth the money. Great place to stay.",5,2013,09,21
233,Great B&B in a Great Location!,"My wife and I stayed at the Ariel House for 3 nights during the 1st week in Sept. We had several heavy bags and arrived to the Hotel @ 5AM. We were met at the bottom step by the night clerk, who carried our bags to our room!! Our room was on the 1st floor, nice room but up and down the steps was too much for my wife, so we requested to move up to the 2nd fl. I guess we were lucky that an extra room was available. We transferred to a  great room on the 2nd floor RM#251. The room was bigger, very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Might sound simple,but they had the best Bath towels in our room of any hotel or castle we stayed in during our 3 week stay in Ireland. I thought they had a great breakfast bar selection and a menu, if you chose to order a hot breakfast. It was only a 10-15 min walk to the Hop-on-Hop bus and the Temple Bar Area. Taxi from the Airport is around 36 euro and a taxi from the Temple bar is about 8 euro.",5,2013,09,20
233,Fab hotel close to the Aviva Stadium,"We landed in Dublin in the pouring rain and arrived at the hotel 2hrs before the earliest check-in time, soaked to the skin and pretty glum. The hotel welcome to two soggy travellers was special, complimentary coffee and wonderful banana cake in the comfy sitting room whilst they got our room ready.  The hotel is right next to the Aviva Stadium and was specially chosen as we were in Dublin to see a concert there. We'd chosen 'room only' as we wanted to be up and about having a look at the city with breakfast on the hoof.  Very handy for the number 4 & 7 bus routes into the city, buy a day's Dublin Bus bus pass in the Spar shop for €6.90 - great value and this ticket will take you right out to the airport as well (Taxi is €33 from the hotel to the airport). To walk into the city centre from the hotel takes 20 minutes - it's a lovely walk on a straight long road past fab Georgian houses and the park, no chance of getting lost. Anyway, a lovely comfortable hotel, excellent service with great staff and an ideal position for our trip to Dublin. Would definitely come back.",5,2013,09,19
233,"helpful, clean and great location","We stayed here for two nights at the end of a seven day trip to Ireland.  The front desk staff were super helpful, asking if we needed help with anything.  They made several reservations for us.  The room was large and clean.  It can definitely use some new paint, but otherwise nice.  Breakfast was great, but no better than any of the other places we stayed.  The area is very nice and safe, close to train stop.  Had a great meal in the village at Rollys. Yum, yum.",4,2013,09,18
233,Faultless,"Having become a bit of a hotel snob over the years, I expect to be disappointed. This hotel surprised us in doing everything to make our stay comfortable, from the welcome snacks in the lounge to Dermot's carrying of our bags to our room (and to another room, when we asked to be relocated due to a noisy aircon unit). We had two great nights' sleep followed by excellent breakfasts, with faultless service. We used the Dart train into town which was brilliant, easy to use and just a short walk away. One day we walked in via Merrion Square and St Stephens Green and that really wasn't a long walk. This really is a paragon of how hotels should be run.",5,2013,09,18
233,Delightful,"I cannot say enough about this place....gorgeous, outstanding service, fantastic breakfast, lovely neighborhood...5 nights here while attending a conference in city center..lovely walk. The staff are all warm and friendly and go out of their way consistently to make your stay  memorable.",5,2013,09,18
233,What hotels should be like,"We stayed one night in this delightful hotel and from arrival we were given 5 star treatment.. The staff were all so helpful. Go for this place, its a gem. so close to DART railway which takes you straight into city centre",5,2013,09,16
233,A Gem in Ballsbridge,"Ariel House is a 15-20 minute walk past Georgian houses and leafy gardens from the heart of historic Dublin. Their rooms are comfortable and their breakfast buffet was the best we found in Ireland. Tea is served every afternoon along with the newspaper in the parlor with its comfortable sofas and tall windows. It is more a ""small hotel"" than a B&B, but the staff is as friendly and helpful as in a B&B. If you want to walk out of your front door and be in the center, you might want to stay elsewhere, but you'll regret missing the scones! We really enjoyed walking through the neighborhood to and from downtown. Depending on your itinerary for the day, you can walk past (or through) beautiful and relaxing St. Stephen's Green and/or Merrion Square Park on the way. The Lansdowne Road DART station is very close by as well.",5,2013,09,15
233,"Good, not great","Perhaps my expectations were too high based on the reviews here, because I found Ariel House slightly wanting. Dublin was the last stop of my trip, and I was very much looking forward to staying at Ariel. 

The GOOD: The room was spacious, clean, the beds are soft and comfortable. (We were upgraded.) Large bathroom with a bathtub, towels are changed daily, and the towel heating rack was switched on overnight so you get warm towels in the chilly morning. Delicious breakfast with good variety of choices. Scones, cakes, biscuits and refreshments available for self-service in the lounge when you arrive. Staff are very helpful, accommodating and professional. Situated away from busy city centre, quiet and lovely neighbourhood near to the Aviva Stadium. 

The BAD: No ventilating fan in the bathroom and window cannot be closed tightly, so it can get cold at night, with toilet bowl situated right next to the window. The shower's water pressure was non-existent, we gave up and took baths instead. Furnishings are starting to look a little worn. (Perhaps we just had bad luck with the room choice? We stayed in no. 224.) While professional, service can be cool depending on who you meet. Breakfast area was really busy around 8.30am one morning, and the food quality and portions suffered as a result. It's a 10 minute bus ride to the city centre.

This review is pretty mixed, and I would give 3.5 stars if I could. Overall, it was a good enough stay, just with some qualifications.",4,2013,09,14
233,Brilliant!,"The rooms are spacious, beds comfy, bathrooms perfect.

No complaints at all.

The staff are wonderful. Very kind and engaging. Nothing is too much trouble. They even supplied my kids with bread to feed the ducks at the nearby park.

Breakfast is amazing. Everything is fresh and the variety is fab.

The rooms are well furnished with antique furniture but nothing too fussy.

Afternoon tea was delicious. Just turn up and it's there... Homemade cakes, scones and biscuits.

If I (we) come to Dublin, I'll definitely be staying here.",5,2013,09,11
233,Warm Welcome for Weary Travelers,"Like other reviewers, we chose this hotel based on previous Tripadvisor reviews. Our experience was outstanding. We arrived 6 hours early, tired and hungry, and Rosie, the manager, apologized that our room was not ready. However, she sent us to breakfast and then gave us a place to refresh before sightseeing. When she phoned to inform us the room was ready a few hours later, we found we'd been given an upgrade. What incredible service. Our room was clean, comfortable and quiet, and the expansive breakfast menu and after hours desserts a bonus we hadn't expected from a smaller B&B. The walk to the downtown area sights was further than we'd realized, but taxi cabs were abundant and reasonable in price. A wonderful place to stay close to great restaurants and bistro's.",5,2013,09,09
233,"Excellent location, friendly staff","We stayed here for two nights to visit the RDS. We arrived late in the evening, the member of staff that greeted us was very welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. In the morning that theme continued, all staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel is very well furnished and welcoming. Our room was clean with a comfortable bed and well appointed. Great choice at breakfast. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone with hesitation.",5,2013,09,07
233,Charming Hotel,"Top rate experience at Ariel House. Atmosphere & décor was very charming. Family loved the drawing room with the grand piano and afternoon tea with plentiful selection of home baked treats! Breakfast was equally amazing - best pancakes we have ever enjoyed, a welcome break from the traditional breakfasts. Street was tree lined and property had a lovely garden area with flowers that we now refer to as ""fairy flowers"" - believe these may be fuchsia's. Within walking distance to restaurants and downtown core - though it was a good 15-20min walk to the main canal. If staying here - do try to enjoy a pizza at Paulie's Pizza which is near by. Parking available on site - a bit of a tight squeeze. WiFi included in rate. Family room with two double beds - provided ample room with sitting area and large washroom.",5,2013,09,05
233,Loved this hotel,"We booked this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews and hoped for the best -  result:  it worked out perfectly for us!  Every aspect of our stay was top notch.  The breakfast was superb, especially the selection of Irish cheeses and breads.    It was a little farther from the downtown than we expected, but it was worth it, for the excellent nights' sleep.    A great value.  We will be back.",5,2013,09,03
233,Fantastic hotel in Dublin,"We recently stayed 4 nights at Ariel. Lovely old hotel amongst lovely tree lined streets and expensive houses. We had a large room, with ensuite and what a great brekkie which was included with choices of cooked dishes etc. also there was always tea, coffee cakes, scones etc in the lounge to help yourself. The staff were very helpful and friendly, in fact we transferred to another hotel as our tour was departing from there and we had left our adaptor in the plug at Ariel , I phoned them and they delivered it to our hotel. Great location near to the DART station at Lansdowne station so easy access to city also the Aviva Stadium nearby (Lansdowne Road).
Free Internet access at hotel. Would definitely stay there again and recommend to others.",5,2013,09,03
233,superb!,"I cannot express my delight with the manners, the furnishings, and the considerations of the staff at Ariel House. The breakfast is deservedly legendary, the room was drop-dead gorgeous, the staff was patient and considerate. Extraordinary in many ways, including changing of my accommodation when they noticed my daughter had asthma, and thought she might be more comfortable in a larger area. Lovely details throughout. Make sure you use a DART pass or plan on other similar ticket usage.",5,2013,08,31
233,"Great hotel, great location, great price","Fantastic hotel with a really great location next to the DART, but far enough away where you won't be distracted by the noise.  The breakfast was also included and had a great selection of authentic Irish dishes.   Rooms were clean and quite large for Europe, and the water pressure was not an issue (also can be problematic in Europe).  The rooms did not have AC like more in Ireland, but they provided a fan which worked just as well with the windows open.  Staff were all outstanding.  Staff will book taxis (convienient for aiport transfers where they have a flat rate agreement with a local company that saved us ~10 Euro).  The surrounding neighborhood of Ballsbridge also had several pickup locations for local tours, where we didn't have to go into the city for a pickup which allowed for time to enjoy breakfast each day.

The one knock i had was we stayed in the bottom floor which had lousy wireless connection, but we were so busy that it wasn't an issue, we just walked upstairs but if you need this I would recommend the second floor rooms.",5,2013,08,30
233,Superior accommodations & staff,"My wife & I visited the Ariel House for the first night on a weeklong trip through Ireland. Everything was first class from accommodating our early arrival to our departure. The staff was extremely friendly & the breakfast very good. It was a great location outside of the busy downtown area, but with close proximity to restaurants & shops. Beautiful boutique hotel which we would highly recommend.",5,2013,08,28
233,Fantastic junior suite's,"The two nights we had staying in Ariel House were great.  Lovely breakfast, spacious junior suite's, walking distance to shops and restaurants, free sweets in the tea room and very close to the train station (to head into the city).  Very handy for rugby fans as it is a kick away from Aviva Stadium.",4,2013,08,27
233,wonderful experience,stayed there this month and found every aspect of the stay at ariel house first class .. from staff to breakfast to the lovely room .. only problem was that staying at such a lovely place at the start of our holiday made everything else in ireland seem sub standard ..,5,2013,08,26
233,Wonderful start to our Ireland holiday!,"Ariel House was our first booking experience with the guidance of Trip Advisor and how right they were! The hotel is a beautifully appointed old Victorian manor house which has been wonderfully renovated and fitted out. The welcome was very warm and the staff could not have been more helpful and accommodating. The room was large, the bed huge and comfortable and the bathroom spacious. Free wifi and afternoon tea a bonus! Very good location close to rail and even a pleasant walk to catch the round city hop-on, hop-off bus. In all a fantastic start to our Ireland experience. Well worth the visit. ",5,2013,08,24
233,Rob 'n' Jens stay in Dublin,"It was a joy to stay at Ariel Ho. We arrived fairly late in the day and received a warm welcome from reception staff with the normal rundown of breakfast times, reception times (24hr) etc..  
The room was well presented but just a little tired with grubby lampshade & bulb, in the bathroom grout missing between some tiles but on the whole  very nice. Hot water from the shower took an age to come through whilst the bath water would come through hot very quickly, not sure why this should be. The bed was a good size and very comfy.
That evening we headed out to the local Ballsbridge village area and ate at the ‘Baan Thai’ that had been ranked on Tripadvisor 149 / 1322. The meal was fantastic and well worth the 10 minute easy stroll from Ariel Ho. The area felt safe and didn’t feel threatening wandering about at night.
Breakfast the next morning was sensational. Cooked specifically to order for you, cooked to perfection  and very attentive breakfast staff checking if everything is/was satisfactory and if there was anything else you require. In addition or alternatively you will have a choice of cereals, fruit, juices and yogurt. The quality of the produce is also second to none with Ariel Ho. Proudly identifying suppliers & producers of the items on their menu.
Other good choices for evening dining and entertainment would be the ‘Evening of Food, Folklore and Fairies’ at Dublins reputed oldest pub ‘The Brazen Head’ this was highly entertaining, the food wholesome but not fancy and the beer was good. For me pricewise it wasn’t expensive but for Americans & some Europeans used to lower prices it may well seem expensive. A trip along Temple Bar to sample the drinking establishment wares & entertainment is a must. Public transport back to Lansdowne Road from Tara Street Station is easy and safe, depending on your timing you may have to wait 15mins for the train which is an 8 minute ride + 2 minute stroll from Lansdowne Rd station to Ariel Ho.
To me Dublin whilst having some beautiful architecture feels grubby with some boarded shopfronts & buildings with quite a bit of graffiti on display.
A trip on the train out to Howth (about 1/2hr by train) from Lansdowne Rd Station is well worth your time if the weather is good as other than a coastal walk there isn’t much there but the 2-3 hr walk plus a lunch at the ‘Bloody Stream’ public house is well worth half a day of your time.

If you return to Ariel Ho early afternoon their is afternoon tea/coffee & pastries on offer at no charge which is a nice treat.

I would highly recommend staying at Ariel House. If you are attending an international or other event at the AVIVA Stadium there is no closer or better option for accommodation as Ariel Ho is only 2 mins walk from the stadium.",5,2013,08,23
233,Loved it!,Beautiful place with a great breakfast. It was a little outside of the city center but very close to the DART station and buses. Would definitely stay again if in Dublin. The staff was also very helpful. We really enjoyed our stay. ,5,2013,08,22
233,We loved it!,"A great place to stay. It exceeded expectations. Very helpful staff, nice room, great breakfast. If you are happy to be a little way out of the centre of Dublin, Ariel House is a very good choice. The DART train station is just down the road and is easy to use.

Ariel House will certainly be top of my list next time I go back to Dublin.",5,2013,08,20
233,Where else would you stay?,"It is not for nothing that this Guesthouse has won so many rewards over the last years. Everything is simply perfect at Ariel House!

When we arrived, we were surprised to learn that we had been upgraded for free to a junior suite (James Joyce room). We were first offered tee in the dining room. The room was very spacious and luxurious, the same holds for the bathroom. Service was exceptionally good and friendly, breakfast was great too.

Although this guesthouse is a little off the beaten track, it is worthwhile to stay in this little paradise and island of excellence!",5,2013,08,18
233,This will be our regular place to stay in Dublin,"We've visited Dublin countless times, and never have we had such a good experience as that which we had in Ariel House. We stayed there twice on this current trip (total of 5 nights) and both stays were faultless. The rooms were excellent (the second stay we were in a junior suite - magnificent!), the breakfast was among the best we've had in any hotel, there was parking available, the proximity to the DART (Train) and buses to town are a blessing, the lounge was available all day with tea/coffee and cakes, etc. etc.....but above all we would have to mention the attitude of the staff. Deirdre and Rosie were a combination of efficiency and hospitality which is rare to find anywhere....let alone in a large city. The staff in the dining room were helpful and friendly, the front desk was always ready with a smile and a willingness to offer assistance on anything starting from help with the luggage to recommendations for dinner (I can warmly recommend the Old Schoolhouse....just a 10 minute walk up the road) or change for the buses (exact change required on the Dublin buses)!
To top it all - all of the above came at a very reasonable cost - the same or less as we've paid in the past for very mediocre B&B's.
Bottom line - on our next trip to Dublin we will be staying here again.",5,2013,08,18
233,"Wonderful, wonderful sonderful!","The staff was gracious and evtremely accomidating, no matter the hour, night or day, the food was amazing (be brave and try the Irish breakfast, the black pudding is quite good if you mix it with your eggs), the rooms were lovely and their tee time was so much fun.  Even more fun coming back to the hotel late after an evening of sampling how delish guinness is in Dublin, and chowing down on the left over tea cakes.  I't's a few doors away from the Dart, so downtown is minutes away.  I honestly can't reco this place high enough.",5,2013,08,18
233,Nothing too much trouble,"Lovely stay at Ariel house, as others have said the breakfasts are AMAZING - worth the price alone. Summer berry crunch followed by Smoked Salmon and Poached egg on Breakfast muffin was my favourite, along with the lovely cheeses.
Rosie, Deirdre and the rest of the team were so welcoming and helpful in booking tickets, restaurants and general advice. It was just so refreshing and welcoming.
The tea and cakes that are served in the afternoon are lovely (look out for the chocolate squares - they disappear particularly quickly!)
The hotel is located in Ballsbridge which is a very nice (if expensive) area of Dublin - there are numerous good restaurants around and these were busy even on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings when you would expect places to be quiet. Much better than the city centre restaurants.
Decent 20min walk into the centre, DART very close but we didn't use as the weather was OK.
Thoroughly recommend this hotel/guest house - at the risk of finding it fully booked when we want to return!!!",5,2013,08,18
233,Wonderful place to stay,"I stayed at the Ariel House 3 times during my trip to Ireland (a total of 8 nights) I stayed in 3 different rooms and all were comfortable.  Dieirdre, Rosie, Eoin and the rest of the staff are so welcoming & accomodating.  The breakfast and afternoon tea were delicious. The location is about a 20 minute walk to city centre.  I look forward to staying there again on my next trip to Dublin.",5,2013,08,16
233,Extraordinary breakfast but not in city center,"If you are looking for a quiet place to stay in Dublin, with an extraordinary breakfast, this is your place.  Rooms are spacious and have all the amenities you may need. The house itself is lovely. But it will take you at least 20 min to walk to the city center. Public transport is however close enough, if you are not into walking. Breakfast is worthwhile!!!
      ",4,2013,08,14
233,Simply the best!,"We visited Ariel House for the third year in a row this summer and I can't rate it highly enough. The staff are excellent; helpful, friendly and well informed.  The rooms are beautifully appointed, well equiped and exceptionally comfortable (I particularly liked the small jar of homemade lemon biscuits). The breakfasts are outstanding, with something to suit everyone's taste! It was my daughter's 18th birthday during our stay and the staff went out of their way to help make it a special occasion.",5,2013,08,14
233,Another fantastic stay at Ariel,"Mum & I returned to the Ariel House again this year and were not disappointed.The welcome we received was as if we were long lost friends,all the staff as always were friendly and very helpful. The breakfasts were superb and Deirdre and her team even allowed us the use of the dining room for our wee picnic supper on a couple of evenings, adding treats to make it even more special.  (My Mum is 91 so tripping the light fantastic every night in Dublin fair city was not going to work!) We didn't have time to sample an Afternoon Tea ourselves, but I did witness one...a treat is certainly in store for anyone, a real feast awaits you!  The Ariel, Deirdre and her team certainly make your trip one to remember. My partner and I have decided to spend our honeymoon there next year and can't wait to return and enjoy it all. Thanks for another great stay.",5,2013,08,14
233,Incredible service and the best breakfast!,"We stayed for 3 nights in a deluxe room and were very happy with our stay. The room was large and nicely appointed and included an en-suite 4 piece bath. The room was furnished with nice antiques, the bed was comfortable and although there was no air-conditioning, a fan was provided on request for the warmer than usually Dublin temperatures we experienced during our stay.

Service exceeded our expectations. We were greeted warmly  on arrival and any requests (boarding pass printing, directions to nearby attractions and restaurants, questions about meal hours, etc.) we answered with enthusiasm and courtesy.

The breakfast was everything others report - both a hot disk menu and all-you-can-eat assortment of breads, fruit and beverages are included in the room price. The food was of very good quality and the service was excellent. We were also very pleased with the included afternoon tea.

The only thing that appeared lacking was the quality of the toiletries provided. This is a minor complaint but higher quality toiletries would not cost much and would match the rest of the great experience at Ariel House.",5,2013,08,09
233,Great stay at Ariel house,"Stayed 2 nights at Ariel house, July 22-24. Great B&B with nice location (2-300 meters from Lansdown road DART station which will take you to Dublin center in 5-10 min), a few  restaurants nearby and the pretty amazing Aviva Stadium nearby. We had a nice room with 2 queen beds, a nice bathroom and plenty of space. Excellent breakfast, one can choose from a buffet or order special items, salmon, sausages, irish breakfast, nice and good. Everything was almost perfect, just had an issue with a couple of things in the bathroom but the staff was friendly and helpful. My only (small) complain is that it feels a little bit more like an hotel than a B&B, everyone is very professional but you don't really know who owns the place...because you never met them...at least we did not...the place lacks some personal interaction which you would expect when you choose B&B vs hotel (see my other review for Friars Glen in Killarney)....but you won't be disappointed by the service, room, locations, breakfast, etc..Ariel house certainly deserves its rank as one of the best B&B in Dublin.",5,2013,08,07
233,"Lovely guesthouse, lovely area",We spent two days in Ariel House. The staff were nice and very helpful. Lovely building in a nice location. Excellent breakfast. Our booking didn't include breakfast but the extra cost was well worth it and very reasonable. We were able to walk comfortably into town and found several restaurants and pubs within walking distance. The taxi ride from the airport was about €40.00. Recommend Ariel House as a definite place to consider when visiting Dublin.,5,2013,08,06
233,"Friendly, helpful service in a delightful period house. Afternoon tea a treat!","Just stayed one night on way back to UK but very pleased with choice- thank you again Trip Advisor reviewers. No dogs allowed but expected this and staff very helpful. 
Quiet and comfortable beds in family room with good space in room. ",5,2013,08,05
233,Just Perfect!,"My wife and I stayed for three nights a couple of weeks ago and this is just simply a perfect place. From the staff who go out of their way to truly the best breakfast we had during our entire two-week stay in Ireland. 

The location is within walking distance of the city center, including Trinity College, St. Stephen's Green and the Grafton strett shopping and dining area. From the Green, you can take a hop on, hop off bus to many of the other attractions, which is good for the day. 

Overall, this place, its staff and location are unbeatable. If you are looking for a true Inn experience and want the flexibility of being in the city area with some peace and quiet too, Ariel House is a must stay.

A home away from home!
",5,2013,08,05
233,Don't stay anywhere else!,"As soon as we walked into this classy, vintage hotel we knew we would be enjoying our stay. 

The hotel is located right next to the Dart (Train Station) so it's super easy and quick to get around. Despite this, once inside your room it is whisper quiet, very roomy (the roof is super high), spotless and has all the little essentials side for your stay - this hotel is Dublin's little gem!

Deidre is a wonderful, well mannered woman and her team are the nicest hotel staff we have come across in our travels. We felt very welcomed every morning at breakfast (which was delicious, by the way) and they would always wish us a good day as we left the hotel to go explore the local attractions.

If you are looking for a warm Irish welcome and something new from the generic Ibis, Hilton and other hotel chains, you are in for a treat! We would love to come back one day. :-)",5,2013,08,03
233,Dublin's most amazing secret ...ssh don't tell anyone !!,"Stunning period guest house on the Lansdowne Road. Great connections via Dart. Deidre and the team will ensure you have the most amazing stay. Nothing is too much trouble and they are all extremely helpful with advice especially on good places to eat and how to get around. 

Breakfast is an experience in itself! Gorgeous food beautifully served and lovely to saviour it in the breakfast room. Afternoon tea Wow needs to be seen to be believed! 

Will never stay anywhere else in  Dublin again !",5,2013,08,02
233,Awesome stay!,"This place is the only place to stay in Dublin. The staff were extremely helpful during our stay, so accommodating with our constant questions re: excursions, places to dine, etc. The location was quiet, breakfasts lovely - a great start to our family vacation in Ireland!

A special thank you to Deidre for going above and beyond :)",5,2013,07,31
233,Loved staying here,"I can't think of a better base for visiting Dublin than Ariel House.  They were the soul of friendliness and warmth.  The location is brilliant, right near the Dart train to get into the city center.  Best staff anywhere.  And the breakfasts can't be beat.  The internet was not working properly in our room, which was a bit of an inconvenience, but I know they're working on it.  And there certainly was nothing wrong with sitting in the charming living room to get online.  They even put out fruited water, cakes and cookies in the afternoons and evenings, to make it pleasant.  I'd definitely recommend this charming hotel.",5,2013,07,30
233,Absolutely Beautiful,"This Hotel was lovely. Located in a very nice part of Dublin, the staff was so helpful and kind. We received a complimentary upgrade and had the James Joyce room. 15 foot ceilings and a gorgeous canopy bed were quite a treat. They packed a lovely breakfast for us as we had a very early morning. The price was quite reasonable for such a nice place, upgrade or not. Highly recommended!",5,2013,07,29
233,Lovely place,"Firstly, the staff are amazing. They really can't do enough for you. The breakfast is amazing, and the choices are wide and varied. 

The location is good as you are either about a nice 30 minute walk into the centre, or just two stops on the local transit system, the DART. 

Would definitely stay there again. ",4,2013,07,27
233,"Well deserving of high reviews, but...","Stayed at the Ariel House for 4 nights this July. The service is top notch. The house and rooms are really clean. Breakfast, as noted by many reviewers, is pretty great. But, the bathroom in our room had some issues. First and foremost...the shower's water pressure on the front part of the house we stayed in (we were in 224) in almost useless to someone like me with shoulder length thicker hair. It was really disappointing and took a long time to thoroughly wet, wash and rinse my hair. I mentioned this to the staff while leaving and was assured that this problem was something they were working on and hoping to implement soon. (They are considering some sort of pump that will improve the pressure, but haven't moved forward because it will create other problems...i.e. the noise it might cause to other rooms.) Anyways, in my mind, the problem was significant enough that I feel that it might be wise to advertise that this room (and any others that are also affected) has this issue in booking descriptions. The other issues in the bathroom were a non-functioning hair dryer (a new one was brought for us when we mentioned it) and the toilet that seemed to dribble water for a long time after flushing. On a more positive note, we were here during some amazing summer weather and the Ariel House had a fan in our room, which I really appreciated. Most UK/Ireland locations aren't equipped with AC because it just isn't necessary, so the fan was great to have on hand. 

This is a great place to stay, but if any of the above issues are concerns for you be sure to check ahead of time what room you're booking and make sure to book one that will suit your needs. 

To get to Ariel House from the airport, we took a taxi that cost about Euro 30. The AirCoach bus currently mentioned on their site does not run to the listed stop, as that route has been cancelled as of now.",4,2013,07,26
233,"Friendly, classy and wonderful stay!","Immediately upon arriving at Ariel House we were greeted by Deirdre, the friendly woman at the desk. She formally greeted us as well as offered us tea. The BB is located by the Aviva stadium which has a dart, or train station, within a 2 minute walking distance. We did take cabs home however as we came back late a few times. Anyways, the entire staff is friendly and always willing to help with whatever you may need. The rooms are clean and nice. The only negative, although no fault of theirs, is that it was extremely hot in our room the first day even with the small window open. Ireland is having one of the hottest summers ever. Despite that, we were able to sleep as it cooled down late into the night. The breakfast is grande! The dining room is big and beautiful. Fresh flowers are everywhere and it just really is a nice touch. I definitely would stay here again!",5,2013,07,26
233,A lovely gem in Dublin.,"The Ariel House is not in center city Dublin, which is a plus.  It is on a quiet street in a quiet area near Aviva Stadium, about a 12 Euro can ride to center city.  The hotel staff and the accommodations and food make you feel like visiting royalty.  We were there in July, and like most European hotels, there was no air conditioning, however, open windows in the quiet area were fine.  We were all over Europe and this was one of our favorite stays.  If you don't mind spending the Euros on a cab, this is your hotel.  It is close to a Starbucks, restaurants, post office and some great pubs.",5,2013,07,25
233,Comfortable and Peaceful Location,We decided to stay at this hotel because of the good reviews on Trip Advisor and I wanted somewhere comfortable and quiet and that was what we got. The choice of food at breakfast is very good and the level of service brilliant. The rooms were spacious and quiet. Some of the furnishings in our room were a little impractical but the style went with the decoration and period of the house.  We both enjoyed our stay and would recommend. It was good to have wifi too and the nibbles available in the lounge and complimentary paper were very welcome. Handy for the Dart and easy walk into town.,4,2013,07,23
233,If I had a B&B this is how I would run it!!,Had a great stay at Ariel House.  We had the George Bernard Shaw room and it was lovely and spacious.  We had a great nights sleep even with the heat.  Breakfast was super.  Nice that the hot food was cooked on request and it was presented very nicely.  Location was great especially for the Aviva or RDS.  The dart is at the end of the street.  The best bit was the scrummy cakes and biscuits that are available in the lounge most of the day.  Staff are always willing to make you tea on request. Priceless when you are on holiday!!,5,2013,07,23
233,very hospitable,"The Ariel House staff was gracious and helpful.  Early check in not a problem when we arrived, pleasant breakfast, spacious bathroom, nice location.  Small parking lot available; close to train station.  Kept or luggage safely for us so we can sight see on day of check out.",4,2013,07,22
233,A gracious B&B in Dublin,"Reading the other reviews, I have little to add other than this was a first-rate B&B. No matter the request, the staff is gracious and eager to please. Although there are no elevators, they are quick to help you with your bags and anything else you need. The location is a bit of a walk to the center of town, but the train to town is only half a block away. Breakfast is excellent with great variety. We booked our stay through Expedia, so we paid 5.5 euros each for breakfast -- still a great value for the quality and variety of food, served in a lovely glass-walled room facing the garden.",5,2013,07,20
233,Amazing Service Ethic!,"This is a very rare review, I made reservations for us in May 2013, we were a group of 4 colleagues to stay overnight in July 2013 through Booking.com and when we pitched they couldn't find our booking and they were full booked.  I was able to spot the booking on their system and I had a confirmation on my computer.  Firstly, we were travelling in the UK and didn't bother to get Euros so we couldn't pay the cab and the hotel just came through for us and they were going to charge the fare on our bill.  Anyway, once the reception realised the error, the Manager was called and within a few minutes a hotel nearby was convinced to take us in but when we checked where our meetings were, we realised that we needed to be closer to the centre of town so they arranged a place at a downtown hotel, they got a cab to pick us up and arranged to cover 50% of the hotel bill.  Excellent service and just amazing class and elegance, sorry I can't tell you more about the place but I reckon if they could do that for us, imagine what they can do if and when you stay with them.",5,2013,07,18
233,Elegant home in Ballsbridge area of Dublin,"The Ariel House is very much as advertised. The breakfasts are excellent, served in a charming breakfast room near Reception.  We stayed in a Jr. Suite, room 255, which had a rather odd configuration. It was oblong shaped which meant that the sitting area was narrow and you could not really watch the TV from the easy chairs. The king size bed was very comfortable and we specifically asked for a bed without footboard as my husband is tall and dislikes fighting a restriction at the end of the bed. The bathroom was modern but small, very little shelf space for toiletries. The shower had excellent water pressure and a steady temperature. A DVD player and a couple of movies were placed in the room, a nice touch. The room and hotel were spotlessly clean throughout. Be aware that there are steep stairs and many dividing swing doors to navigate getting to and from your room. The staff will help you with baggage.

We parked our car at the front of the hotel for our 2 day stay and found the Hop On Hop Off Tour Bus an easy 15/20 minute walk from the hotel. We used the 2 day Green Bus pass to navigate the highlights of the city. The Chop House restaurant, about a 10 minute walk away was recommended by the staff for dinner and it was excellent.

For a room this size in the city, with a king size bed, we feel we received value for our money.",4,2013,07,17
233,Golden Oldies,"My husband (72) and myself (67) stayed there for four nights beginning June. We had a problem getting up the stairs ( which are quite steep) with our bags. Another person sitting on the stairs gave us a hand up. Once the lady at reception saw us she quickly came to give us a hand. It cost us 35 Euro for a taxi from the airport. We arrived about 8.00pm. Our room was on the same level as reception. As there are no lifts  internal stairs could be a problem. The room was a bit small once we got  our bags in it, but it was very clean and had nice linen. The bathroom had a shower over the bath and was a bit small. Toiletries were provided. Room was serviced daily. We found it a bit warm but we were able to sleep with our window open and curtain back. Breakfast was lovely with help yourself to continential, hot breakfast was cooked fresh. There was plenty of choice. Afternoon tea was provided for guests in the lounge each afternoon. Coffee, cakes and pastries. Teas was provided upon request to reception. This is a lovely area to sit and talk to other guest or just read the paper.provided. There were no teabags provided in the room, just coffee but when staff realised I had bought my own, they quickly appeared in the room. Ariel House is a two minute walk to the train station which takes you right into the city (about 10 mins).  7 Euro return for two. It is also very close to the lovely Aviva stadium (at the end of the street) there are shops and food outlets, post office an easy 10 minutes walk. The staff here are just magic, nothing is a bother and they take the time to find out how your day went and to make you feel very welcome. The place was very clean and really is a beautiful building. For a very small cost we were able to get our washing done before we left. The day we left our bags were stored for us as we did not have to leave for the airport until 7.30pm. Check out is 12 midday. We can back later in the afternoon and spent some time in the lounge where we were able to have a tea and coffee. We greatly appreciated this. There is plenty of parking at Ariel house as there are lots of parks behind the house.",5,2013,07,15
233,Wonderful Guesthouse,"We enjoyed our recent stay at the Ariel House, convenient to all of our Dublin activities but quiet enough to sleep comfortably without disturbances. The front office staff were very accommodating and helpful toward my extended family. It was a wonderful finish to our 2 week Ireland holiday!",5,2013,07,14
233,"Great Stay, Beautiful rooms","Stayed last two nights in Ireland at the Ariel House.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Rooms clean and nicely decorated.  Bathrooms modern and comfortable.  Location close to downtown.  Easy to get around.  Quiet street (no one in stadium while we stayed there).  Breakfast was very good.  Staff prepared us a ""take away"" breakfast second morning as we had to leave early to catch flight home.  Would highly recommend this hotel to others and will stay there again when I return to Ireland.",5,2013,07,13
233,Beautiful Guesthouse,Stayed here for two nights and it was a beautiful experience.  Breakfast was great and the location was close to public transport...either bus or train.  Will definitely return later in our holiday.  Plenty of places to eat just a short walk away and reception can help you with find something to suit all budgets. ,5,2013,07,12
233,Beautiful building!,"This was a lovely building with old-fashioned charm.  In addition to our rooms, there was a lobby with plush couches, where we could meet the other members of our group.  

The neighborhood was quiet, but close to several restaurants and not that far from the major tourist attractions.  We usually walked, but there was also public transportation.",5,2013,07,09
233,Ariel House,Had a lovely weekend here staying at this conveniently located hotel. Was in Dublin to see Rod Stewart and hotel located ideally for short walk to RDS also conveniently located for the Dart line into the city. Hotel staff very pleasant and extremely helpful. Breakfast was freshly cooked and a good selection of hot and cold. Rooms very pleasant and clean.,4,2013,07,05
233,What a breakfast!,"My partner and I stayed at Ariel House for three months in June. 

My initial impression wasn't great as we took public transport to get there and I found the directions on the website to be quite confusing- we weren't sure where to get off the bus, and when we did get off we got a bit lost as they have written on the website to turn at the Ballsbridge Inn, which doesn't exist. It turns out they meant the Ballsbridge Hotel. However we can take half the blame because we didn't bring a map. I think if we'd had a map we could have worked it out a bit quicker.

Once we actually got there I was quickly won over. The staff are lovely and very helpful, the room was clean and quiet, the bed was comfortable, it's easy walking distance to the city and Trinity College. The stand out was the breakfast though- exceptional service and food. Yum! 

The only negative was the room temperature. We came on probably the only three hot days in the year and the room got uncomfortably warm. Like most hotels in Europe there was no cooling and unfortunately we were also unable to open the door to the outside world to air out the room because it had an alarm attached. But I doubt this would be a problem the other 95% of the year. 

All in all we had a fantastic stay. I would definitely visit again.",5,2013,07,05
233,Will definitely come back!,"We stayed at Ariel House June 18-22,at the end of a 2 weeks trip through Europe,and we absolutely loved this location. It was out of the hustle and bustle of the city (except for Rihanna,but that didn't bother me one bit) but as others have said,is easily accessible via walking or dart. All of the staff were kind and accommodating,had a breakfast to go for my family ready at 5:45 am for our day trip to Cliffs of Moher and alway's asked how we were. Ariel House went above and beyond my expectations and we cannot wait to go back. :)",5,2013,07,04
233,Relaxed atmosphere and great breakfast & service,"On arrival the receptionist was really helpful. My room was clean and smart. The breakfast the next day was superb and deserves the positive comments on trip advisor. I'm on a dairy free diet and they were very helpful during breakfast ... In fact I left with a recipe for home made dairy free bread i admired. On the day I checked out I left by bags with reception and went shopping. On my return to pick up my bags I was offered a complementary coffee and bun in the study / piano room prior to leaving... Superb!  The rooms are appropriately priced but worth the price due to the relaxed nature of the guest house, the breakfast and quality of service.",5,2013,07,02
233,Brilliant Stay.,"Stayed here for the Rihanna concert and had a great stay. Deirdre and Rosie were so nice I can't thank them more for helping us have a great stay. I had been e-mailing Deirdre previously about a skin allergy to bio washing powder and she had been great about the whole thing, she even e-mailed me the ingredients of the washing powder she was a great help. When we got there we got upgraded to the junior suite !! It was brilliant ! In the room it was really nice the bed was class, it was four poster and so comfy ! There was a dvd in the room for us too it was fast and furious 5 we were delighted as we are obsessed with fast and furious! Breakfast in the morning was lovely too. You can't fault this place everyone is just to nice ! Great Stay !!",5,2013,07,02
233,A lovely stay,"A group of us (11 women in all!) stayed at Ariel House last weekend and nearly everything was perfect!

The staff was friendly and helpful, always willing to go above and beyond to make us happy.

The location is in a surprisingly quiet neighborhood, making it easy to sleep. You are right next to the stadium, so there might be some noise on game days.

The breakfast they offer was simply amazing, such choice and each more delicious than the next. I could have eaten their fresh-baked scones for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day. In addition, the little cakes available at tea time every day were very special, as were the melt-in-your mouth cookies in our rooms.

The rooms and bathroom were spacious, beds were comfortable, only drawback to our stay was that the very low water pressure in the shower made it almost unusable (our room, 224, was at the top of the end - others reported better pressure). And you have to take stairs to almost all the rooms, you need to be able to climb and lift - a typical B&B.

I would definitely stay there again when in Dublin!",4,2013,07,02
233,Service is Fabulous,"The concierge here is fabulous, they were so very helpful.  The shower in our room was barely adequate, the water just seemed to trickle out.  The room was clean and spacious.  An easy walk to the Dart for a short trip to the city center. Front steps difficult for older people.  Every night coffee and treats were available.  Cakes were delicious.",4,2013,07,01
233,Very nice!,"Stayed here for two nights with my daughter. It is a lovely guesthouse with great staff and amazing breakfasts! The room we had was very spacious and a large bathroom, beds were comfortable and spotlessly clean. The location was great with the Dart train stop just a few minutes away that took us right into the city centre. All the staff we encountered were very nice and helpful. The only ""complaint"" I would have was that our room was situated right under the front room and there was a lot of walking in there which was quite noisy, but we were also jet lagged so that didn't help. It is a wonderful place to stay and would definitely stay here again! ",5,2013,06,30
233,Great stay,"We stayed here for a four night birthday treat for my husband.  It was a lovely hotel. The staff were very helpful when our room door had a problem and generally extremely helpful. I tried a few of the breakfast options and they were all very tasty.  The baked goods are lovely and we enjoyed our pack up breakfast on the ferry the day we left. 

Our room was lovely, and very big.  The (four-poster) bed was very comfortable and our bathroom was huge.  Only two little niggles were the fabric on one of the high back chairs in our room was coming off the chair and the carpet had a few stains.  But, even though our room was in the front of the hotel, we did not hear the trains. And Dublin is very accessible from this location - about 25 minutes walk to the city centre, or 5 to the DART station.",4,2013,06,29
233,"Excellent service, breakfast and locale","Stayed 3 nights in a very comfortable, generously sized superior double room. We checked in at midday and the staff allowed us access to our room straight away (fantastic after 33hrs traveling from Sydney). Room was spotless with a shower-over-bath in a modern spacious ensuite - toiletries, hairdryer and heated towel rail included. Bed was a king (!) and very comfortable. Limited parking available though on-street available free after 6pm - first in basis. Breakfast is generous with a self-serve buffet and cooked available. Nice touches with tea (herbal incl) and coffee plus cake, banana bread and biscuits provided free in the afternoons.in the front room. Tourist brochures etc available. Located in an up-market area just out of the city but well serviced by buses that run 10-15 mins apart on main road (10 min walk away). Our 3 day bus passes (incl hop-on-hop off tourist bus) have been great value. Staff are welcoming and helpful - and seem keen to ensure we enjoy our stay in Dublin. Suggestions for dinner were spot-on - simple well-cooked Irish food (Bellamy's pub or the bistro next door in Ballsbridge, or School House Pub, Haddington / Northumberland Rd) at reasonable price and available early to jet-lagged travelers - both 10 min walk from B&B. House is nicely renovated with thought to its history. Highly recommended and would stay again.",5,2013,06,27
233,A great place to stay,Our room was very comfortable and beautifully furnished.  The staff were warm and helpful.  The sitting room was nice and cakes were provided every afternoon.  We didn't have breakfast.   It took about 25 mins to walk into Dublin centre although the train stop was convenient if preferred. We could hear the trains but they didn't seem to run through the night.  It is very convenient for the Lansdowne stadium which would be noisy if there were an event so you might want to check their diary. We could clearly hear the Robbie Williams concert sound check but felt it was a bonus :),4,2013,06,24
233,Very nice Guesthouse,"A very nice guesthouse in a wonderful location, close enough to walk into town and yet nice and quite. The house itself is a bit old and does need some minor repairs here and there, but overall it was very clean and well-presented. The room was spacious, as was the ensuite bathroom. Breakfast was excellent! We even had a nice view of the garden. 24 hour congierce service is another bonus of this guesthouse. The price is reasonable for Dublin. For me the best choice in the city.",4,2013,06,22
233,Very nice place unless there is a concert.,We are currently staying here. We loved the place and the staff. They are all super helpful and will do their best to help you. Their breakfast was yummy! They are about a 20 min walk from downtown. BUT the downfall is that Rihanna had a concert here and it's RIGHT next door. We had to fight the crowds to get into the B&B. We can hear the concert loud and clear word for word. I would check and make sure there isn't a concert going on when you stay here.,4,2013,06,21
233,Trust Trip advisor. This is a lovely B&B and more,"We were delighted with the size of our rooms and the lovely furnishings. The bedding was very comfortable and we had everything we needed. The staff welcomed us with coffee and some banana bread and were very kind to offer us a breakfast 'take away pack' for the next day as we were doing a Rail tour. This was very generous considering our gluten intolerance and it was greatly appreciated. The location is great as it is within striking distance of the city and is in a very lovely part of town. We had a medical emergency on our last of four days and the manageress even offered to drive us to the hospital. We cannot rate the staff highly enough; they were generous and thoughtful, attentive and informative. Breakfasts are a treat in themselves and you will feel very grand indeed as you are waited on with care and provided wonderful choices for your morning feast. Lovely, lovely, lovely.",5,2013,06,19
233,Lovely First Stop in Dublin,"We found the staff very accommodating, the breakfasts were spectacular and the rooms were comfortable.  It was a short cab ride to Trinity College and Grafton street.  The staff was great to get us booked into evening events and dinner.",4,2013,06,18
233,Great place to stay,"The owners/managers are top notch, and the rooms are amazing.

We were provided with every bit of information we could want about the city.  The DART (rail) station is very close for travel to the city center.  There is also parking on site.

The room was amazing.  Clean, modern, lavishly furnished, and quiet at night.

The breakfast service was good, and the food was tasty.

Loved my stay.",5,2013,06,18
233,Great Quiet Place to Stay,"Excellent service. Took our bags early even though it was not check in time yet. They even allowed us to get a small breakfast that morning we arrived. The breakfast was delicious. The rooms spacious, comfortable and quiet. The staff was eager to help guide you in anyway during your stay. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!",5,2013,06,18
233,"Beautiful, peaceful, convenient and friendly","I had heard from friends who had stayed here how lovely it is and now I know. The staff are friendly, the rooms are comfortable and tastefully designed and the breakfast was lovely. The other rooms, drawing room etc. are also lovely. I have never slept as comfortably in any hotel. There was no noise what so ever despite the fact that it was a Saturday night and I am pretty sure they were full. The room was the perfect temperature, an area I often find problematic with hotels. The Dart station (train station) is literally across the road and Connolly station (main station) is only 5 mins by Dart. I would definitely stay here again. It can be a bit pricey but I got a last minute deal. Definitely stay if the price is right! I would prioritise it over a larger hotel.",5,2013,06,16
233,Fantastic place to stay in Dublin,"Located in a beautiful, relaxing, tree-lined neighborhood and still conveniently close to the city center. Comfortable beds, very clean, and tasteful decorations. Breakfast was very good and staff was helpful and accommodating. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin.",5,2013,06,15
233,beautiful place to stay,"This is a gem of a place to stay if you need to be near to the Aviva Stadium. As soon as we arrived the girl at reception checked us in and got us sorted even though we had arrived before check in time.
There was afternoon tea in the drawing room with delicious banana bread and shortbread as well as water with mint and lemon.
Our room was superb with a huge bed and extremely comfortable.  The breakfast was made up of buffet and table service and the choices were plentiful.
i left here feeling full and happy after a great night at a concert in the Aviva.  The owners are lovely and the staff are attentive. Definitely stay here if you need to be in this area.",4,2013,06,15
233,Amazing hospitality,"We stayed here for 3 nights and could not have asked for any better service. All of the staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable and memorable. They even arranged for flowers and a cake for a birthday. The breakfasts each morning were fabulous and the staff were highly attentive to making sure everything was provided.  The location is very close to public transport but walking to town is also easy.
There is a lovely sitting room and afternoon tea is provided daily. It is a nice touch after a busy day in Dublin.
We would highly recommend this property.",5,2013,06,15
233,"Beautiful, quiet, and very accommodating.","Pros:
I stayed here for four days at the beginning of my trip in Dublin and had a wonderful experience! The hotel is in a beautiful old house with traditional furnishings and a tea room which serves tea, coffee and snacks all day long. The rooms are very cozy and the breakfast was delicious! The staff was so helpful and really took the time to make sure I was comfortable and if I needed any help they were very available. 

Cons:
The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood a bit far from the city centre, so if you are traveling with children it is probably not the first choice. I would say this hotel is really centered around couples and small groups of friends who are traveling through Dublin. 

Overall, I absolutely loved my experience and would definitely recommend the Ariel House!",5,2013,06,15
233,Last stay of a trip,"What a place for the Aviva stadium!
We had a standard room in the basement which was fine for one or two nights. The bed was comfortable and the room very clean. Nice touch with soaps and toiletries which you don't always get and fresh milk for the tea and coffee. Tea and tiny cakes were served mid afternoon and this was great as we did not eat lunch and intended to eat our main meal later. Reception staff tremendous - we had a ferry problem which they helped us sort despite being busy with check outs. Breakfast was terrific - i had the pancakes with crispy bacon - a real treat. Use the DART to get into Dublin - good value E3.70 return to Pearse Street which is central and just two stops away. Lots of American guests who are very discerning Would definitely stay here again especially if visiting the AVIVA",5,2013,06,15
233,Must stay in Dublin,Ariel House is a little gem and was certainly a highlight of our visit to Dublin. Staff were incredibly friendly and very helpful. Special mention to the man on the afternoon shift who called up several restaurants to make a dinner reservation for us. Rooms were immaculate and beautifully furnished. Highly recommend.,5,2013,06,04
233,"Quiet hotel, nice neighborhood, highly recommend","After 6 nights at the Ariel Hotel we feel like experts! Other than the location being a bit of a walk to the city center, it was perfect. The neighborhood is extremely quiet,something you won't find in other parts of Dublin. A short walk to the Dart and you'll reach the historic area in a few short minutes. Breakfast is incredible, not only a self-serve breakfast of breads, cereals, fruit and juice, but a wonderful menu with a variety of delicious choices. The staff was always friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,06,03
233,Wonderful place to stay in Dublin,"I had the opportunity to stay at the Ariel House and would do so again in a heartbeat.  The rooms are lovely, the beds comfortable, and the location a treat.  You are in a neighborhood setting and really not a far walk from the city center.  The breakfasts are lovely, and best of all, you can bring in guests which helps when you have family staying and living in the city!",5,2013,06,03
233,Exceptional,"After 500+ reviews, it has all been said but excellence should be acknowledged. If it is comfort, friendliness, location, and a terrific breakfast, or anything else 24/7, this is your choice. My wife casually asked about the cost of our room during our stay and could not believe my answer so add value to these accolades.Simply delightful in every way.",5,2013,06,03
233,dublin stay,"the cost of the weekend trip was paid for by our sons but irrespective of the price when we go back to dublin we will staying at ariel house. i could eulogize all day long about how good the food was, how the staff are a credit to the establishment and how ariel house is worthy of all the plaques and awards bestowed on it, if you're going to dublin stay at ariel house, you will not regret it, they enhanced our time there and took our stay to another level, they pampered us if you will, it was great. --- ian and lizzie robertson",5,2013,06,01
233,The most delightful B&B in Dublin,"By far the best place I have ever stayed in Dublin. Clearly it is not a hotel nor is the price however, the service, friendliness and knowledge of the staff is exceptional. We stay here regularly on business and also for pleasure and nothing is ever too much trouble. The rooms differ but are all in the style of the property and some have very high ceilings with beautiful coving and cornice work, lovely bay windows and some even have little seating or relaxing areas. 
The lounge area always has fresh coffee, water and homemade pastries and biscuits. Sometimes there are other surprises too like little savoury appetizers, so you can sit and read the paper and unwind before heading off out for the evening.
Well worth a try if you are coming to Dublin and the parking is a real bonus if you are on business.",5,2013,06,01
233,"Lovely staff, lousy room!","As a previous reviewer noted, we booked this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews. We booked way back in October 2012 for our 3 night stay beginning May 28. We booked a superior twin room. We contacted the hotel a week before to reconfirm our booking. the room we were given was 257. Horrible!! Down in the bowels of the hotel. Small, dark and with cleaning equipment stored in our stairwell the entire time. Our view was of a dark cement slab in the back. My mother and I had to crawl over each other to get around. When we arrived I dropped my elderly exausted mother off while I dealt with parking. When she enquired about our room she wad told thete was no reservation. She was angry and tired (and neary 80). I had the printed reservation and was told politely that there would be no problem. I feel we were given this room as a punishment. My poor mom had to deal with multiple flights of stairs and a maze of confusing hallways. Now the front desk staff (Kieran especially) was very helpful. The breakfast was outstanding and the waitstaff warm and helpful.",4,2013,05,31
233,Amazing Hotel in Dublin!,"Stayed 2 nights at this hotel which is in a good location, a short walk into the centre of Dublin and would definitely recommend to others. The hotel reception staff were welcoming and so helpful, providing assistance and suggestions for our stay in Dublin as well as our time travelling throughout Ireland. The hotel rooms were lovely and clean and there is a lounge room at the front of the hotel where you can sit and enjoy a cup of tea and relax. The breakfast room and food were also great. I will definitely stay at Ariel House next time I am in Dublin!",5,2013,05,29
233,More than meets the eye - not in a good way,"We used trip advisor for all our hotels and B&B's in Ireland. Every single one rated top 5 and did not disappoint, until this place. Not sure what the difference in the rooms are, or how you get the rooms featured in the good reviews. Our room was in the basement, down many flights of stairs, no elevator. The bed was a full sized bed. The room was hot, no air conditioning. I am SHOCKED that it competed with the other top five hotels in the area. We didn't even stay long enough to snap a picture. We moved to the Gibson Hotel and were more than pleased.",1,2013,05,28
233,Ideal B&B,"visited recently with my sister, great location in a suburb easily within walking distance of the city centre but also on good public transport routes
staff were friendly and more than helpful arranging taxis and advising on restaurants
large, clean room if a little tired
great breakfasts",4,2013,05,28
233,sets the standard,"Stayed here with my son for the Amlin and Heineken cup finals,its position to both stadiums is fantastic.we were given a really warm welcome when we arrived,our room was large clean and spacious,with a lovely en suite,beds were lovely and comfortable.the breakfasts were to die for,help yourself from the buffet or order from the kitchen,nothing was to much trouble,all the staff were more than helpful,service with a smile,which seems to be rare these days.I have stayed in some top hotels around the world,and this place can compare with the best of them,they set a standard that other establishments should follow.i would like to thank all at areil house for a lovely pleasant stay.",5,2013,05,27
233,Unexpectedly amazing,"Booked late in Ryanair Hotels. Wad expecting average, got amazing. We arrived late (12pm) the concierge was there to meet us and carry our bags. 

Breakfast the next morning was a feast to behold. If u want traditional Irish with all the trimmings, this is the place for you. Additionally they cater for all tastes. 

Would highly recommend this guesthouse, whether as late room or usual booking.",5,2013,05,26
233,Just Grand!,"Lovely hotel in leafy suburb of Dublin, but not too far to walk into town if you're fit and within easy reach of dart (train) and buses into town. Good restaurants nearby.
Bedroom very comfortable and roomy, the bed was spacious and like sleeping on a cloud!
Hairdryer in bathroom.
Breakfast beautifully presented and tasted delicious.
We stayed for 3 nights and my husband was unwell during our stay. The staff were very supportive and helpful and went the extra mile for us.
Cannot speak highly enough of this wee gem and would love to return sometime.",5,2013,05,22
233,"A warm Irish welcome, 5 Star Service, and what a Breakfast!!","We stayed here for 6 nights and had high expectations based on the reviews and other information we had read. Not only were our high expectations met, they were way exceeded. Each member of sfaff was very professional, while at the same time displaying a casual warmth that made us feel relaxed and very welcomed throughtout our stay. The breakfast every morning was about the best we ever had at a hotel. There were several options for both of us; which is unusual for us to find as one of us is vegetarian, while the other barely eats any vegetables! The room was very comfortable, and was cleaned with great care and detail each day. This was important and very noticable to us, as we had just come from a 5 night stay at a hotel in London where we had the opposite experience with room cleanliness and maintenance. 
We would recommend this to anyone visiting Dublin, and beyond what the hotel itself has to offer, the location couldn't be better.",5,2013,05,18
233,First Class!,This was our second trip to the Ariel House and it was even better than our first visit. The room was beautiful and the breakfast was by far the best we had during our stay in Ireland. The cheeses and soda break were heavenly. The staff were very helpful and took our luggage in for us as we wanted to get a jump on seeing the sights. The huge bathtub was a welcome sight for a long soak after a day of sightseeing.,5,2013,05,13
233,Excellent Accomodation in a Quiet Location,"Highly recommended!! A great place to stay. Very friendly, welcoming staff.  Giant comfortable room with two double beds.  So much to choose from at breakfast - would have liked to stay longer to try it all out! The Dart (train) is less than five minutes from the door -  very easy to get to the centre.  It is walkable from Ariel House but unfortunately the weather is not dependable!  We came prepared though - with an umbrella!  Thanks for a very enjoyable stay.",5,2013,05,13
233,Fantastic Stay!!,"My husband and I started off our 12 day anniversary trip in Dublin at Ariel House. We arrived first thing in the morning and were given a light breakfast while we waited for our room. 

Our room itself was fantastic. It included a large tub, which was nice. My only note for other unwary Americans like ourselves is that the towel rack is heated, so be careful not to touch it with bare skin!

The breakfast each day was top notch, and the staff was fantastic in helping us get around, making recommendations, and ensuring we were well cared for. 

We highly recommend!",5,2013,05,12
233,Top class!,"We booked six months in advance on a promotion rate, and were extremely impressed with Ariel House. The staff were top of class and the Yeates room featured a four poster bed, chandelier, fireplace and giant bay window. Excellent breakfast for a surprisingly low price. We would absolutely stay again and highly recommend!

Tip: If you can get the Yeates room you will be in for a treat.",5,2013,05,09
233,Gem in a neighborhood,"Beautiful, old and well maintianed bed and breakfast in a quiet neighborhood.  Big rooms, comfortable accommodations and a wide selection of delicious breakfasts served by friendly staff. Tea, coffee and sweets are offered in the afternoon.  Helpful hotel staff.  Easy to get to on DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) and a very short walk from the Lansdowne Road station. A bit of a walk to restuarants but a variety from which to Choose",5,2013,05,08
233,Wonderful place!,We stayed there a couple yrs ago & I am finally writing a review! Had coffee in the parlor while we waited for our room. Beautiful room...very clean...heated towel bars! Superb breakfast. We also stayed here on our return trip....and were put in a suite! Fabulous room...I would highly recommend this place. We plan to return in Sept 2013! Cant wait!,5,2013,05,07
233,"A warm welcome, pleasant clean rooms and a fab breakfast","Upon arrival, we were warmly welcomed at reception, with coffee and cake available in the lounge area of the hotel. The room was pleasant and clean with a lovely powerful shower, though a little noisy at times as i think we were situated by the boiler for the hotel. It wasnt annoying enough to stop us from sleeping though in what were very comfy beds! The hotel is within walking distance of the city centre, and was well located for the ferry the next morning. Although the hotel doesnt normally start serving breakfast until 7.30, given our early departure time, they kindly agreed to serve us breakfast at 7.10, which was especially lovely of them given it was a sunday! and boy was it worth it - what a delightful breakfast and a lovely way to start the day.",4,2013,05,06
233,Authentic and cozy,"I've only stayed for one night, but I can't find faults with this hotel: quiet neighborhood close to the office, very large rooms with vintage furniture, huge bathroom and shower in full repair, friendly staff and great breakfast. I've enjoyed my stay very much. The only thing really is that I had to reconnect to the WiFi quite often. Other than that - perfect.",5,2013,05,06
233,10 out of 10,"My husband doesn't do computers but he stayed with his sister at Aerial House and said it was perfect.  What more can you say! Lovely rooms with good facilities, helpful and friendly staff and good transport links if you don't fancy walking in to the centre.",5,2013,05,04
233,Luxury and elegance,"We stayed a week for our wedding at Ariel house, and we couldn't be more satisfied. My family from France stayed there too. All our rooms were lovely, Victorian style and spacious. Extremely clean:)
The stuff is so kind and helpful. Deirdre is an amazing manager. And it's children/family friendly!!!
The breakfast deserves all his awards, it's really fantastic!!
Plus the location is great:) 
Wifi is good too:)
Best hotel in Dublin!!!!",5,2013,04,22
233,Excellent!!,We arrived to Dublin tired from a trip from Dubai and were pleasantly surprised with the beautiful room and friendliness of the staff. Nothing was to much trouble and the breakfast was brilliant! We stayed on an extra night.,5,2013,04,22
233,Wonderful room at a great price,"Most wonderful place to stay! My sister, aunt, mother and I stayed here for 4 nights while visiting Dublin. We got a large room with two double beds and more space that we were expecting for a B&B in Europe. The room was huge! We had a couch and a dressing table and lots of room for the many suitcases that we traveled with (my sister had been living in Dublin for 2 months!) The location was wonderful, just a short walk to the Dart. The breakfast was the best we had while in Ireland. Definitely get the Cadbury Hot Chocolate! Yum.. I craved that and scones for weeks after I got back! The staff were very friendly and helpful. The only downfall of this hotel is its lack of elevators. We were located in the basement of the adjoining building so initially we had to carry all of our luggage up the large flight of stairs outside, then through the hotel to the next building, then down two more flights of stairs! Exhausting! Luckily when we left, they suggested they open the emergency exit on that level which led us out to the driveway. Thank goodness! As I said, they were very helpful and nice! I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it.",4,2013,04,22
233,"Great place, friendly service!! Warmly recommended!!!","Very friendly people and FANTASTIC breakfast. The are really so cute at Ariel House, always a smile and trying to do their best to please their guests. WiFi is good. Location is ok, nice walk to city center. Can WARMLY RECOMMEND this place!!!",5,2013,04,21
233,As good as any hotel,"I stayed overnight here as i was working near by.  There are several hotels in the area but next time i visit this would be my preference.  The room was a good size with comfortable beds, its hard to pull off using old furniture but still making it comfortable but this really works.  The breakfast was the best i have ever had in a hotel, beautifully cooked, fresh ingredients and a lovel light breakfast room to be served in.  I couldn't recommend this any more its an excellent place to stay.",5,2013,04,21
233,Felt like home!,"I can't say enough how much I loved this hotel. It was very easy to find from the Aircoach (the one included in the Dublin pass). We arrived before the normal check-in time, so the staff made prepping our room a priority and served us tea and scones while we waited in the sitting room. They took our bags up to our room once it was ready (only took about 45 minutes, and we enjoyed the break). 
The room was one of the largest I've stayed in around Europe, with a large wardrobe, vanity desk, and a sitting area with coffee/tea facilities. The bed was very comfortable, and there were extra pillows and blankets in the wardrobe. The bathroom was lovely as well, with a heated towel rack and full-size bath. The only odd thing was the direction of the shower head (toward the glass door), but for us it wasn't an issue. 
Breakfast was delicious - between myself and my husband we tried nearly everything on the menu, and loved everything we tried.
The hotel is outside the city center in the suburb of Ballsbridge, but you can be in the center of Dublin in minutes via the DART train. There are a large number of pubs and restaurants a short 5 minute walk from the hotel, mainly local haunts. The hotel is extremely close to the train line, so if you are a very light sleeper you may want earplugs. We were not bothered by the noise, as it was well muffled by the windows.
Lastly - the staff! Everyone who worked in the hotel was warm, welcoming, and extremely helpful. I LOVED my stay in this hotel, and will definitely book it for my next trip to Dublin! If you want to stay further away from the tourists and feel like you're really in Ireland, stay here!",5,2013,04,20
233,Great Place to Stay outside the Hustle & Bustle,This was an excellent first night in Dublin.  It was just what we needed a quiet nights sleep and a huge breakfast - both a buffet and the option to order from the menu.  The pancakes were really nice!  The location is walkable into the city....,5,2013,04,20
233,Fantastic place to stay!,"If you are looking for a place to stay in Dublin - stop looking, you have found it!!!
We booked into Ariel House for two nights in April this year and cannot recommend it enough. Although not in the city centre the DART station is a 30 second walk away and three stops brings you into the centre of Dublin and the hop on hop off green bus stop is a 10 minute walk away. 

There is secure onsite but limited parking. The rooms are perfect, almost suits and the bathroom was large. The decor is tasteful and in keeping with the feel of the place. In the room were homemade cookies which was a lovely touch.

Breakfast was by far the best I have ever experienced whilst away from home. The menu is extensive and the quality outstanding. Every morning there was home baked goodies from pastries to bread. In fact it is worth staying here for the breakfast alone. In fact breakfast was presented very much like a Michelin starred meal.

The staff were helpful and couldn't do enough to make our stay perfect.

Ariel House is situated a few minutes drive from Dun Laoghaire ferry port.

Overall a perfect stay, we were sad to leave and we will definitely stay at Ariel House again when in Dublin!!!",5,2013,04,20
233,Outstanding,Our home away from home.  We have never had a better stay in any hotel.  Ariel is like a honeymoon every time we go.  Diedre and her staff are the best.  Ballsbridge is a wonderful place to stay in Dublin,5,2013,04,18
233,Fantastic place!,"This hotel is amazing! I couldn't recommend it enough. If you don't mind staying outside of Dublin city centre, this is your place.

- Staff are so unbelievably helpful and friendly, and will help plan your day trips with top recommendations of the area and city tourist attractions
- Great complimentary tea and cakes served in the lounge area, and 5* breakfasts
- Spacious rooms with lovely decor
- A hop skip and a jump away from the Dart station = easy to get into the city centre
- 10 minute walk away from some lovely pubs and restaurants in the Ballsbridge area 

The low water pressure from the shower is the only slightly negative point I could possibly offer, but this wasn't a problem for us! 

Overall, an amazing stay!",5,2013,04,16
233,Wonderful,"We were lucky enough to stay here in February.  This establishment it without a doubt one of the finest I've ever stayed in.  The accommodation is beautifully presented and the staff couldn't do enough to help us enjoy our stay.  

Tea, coffee and cakes are available all afternoon in the Piano Room.  A very welcome addition.  But the big delight of staying at Ariel House are the breakfasts.  I've never seen a breakfast table so beautifully laid out, coupled with the quality of the cooked offerings.  On the first morning of our stay I had a full Irish breakfast whilst my partner had salmon and scrambled eggs.  Both were perfectly cooked.  On the second morning I had a stack of American pancakes, bacon and maple syrup.  Again superbly cooked.

Nothing is too much trouble for the staff at the hotel.  It is in a lovely area of town, very close to Lansdowne Road (about 80 yards walk) and even closer to the station that can take you into town quickly.  I can't recommend this place enough.  Can't wait to go back!",5,2013,04,15
233,A Hotel with Bygone Year's Atmosphere and Charms,"The most remarkable thing at this hotel is the genuine warmth and friendliness of the staff.  We arrived before the check-in time and instead of being told to come back later, we were offered tea while the room was being made.  Everyone was kind and helpful, from the person cleaning our room to the diningroom waitress to the receptionist.  We were quite impressed so  it made it easy to overlook the worn out carpets or the water leaking out from the shower door.  We will definitely come back.",4,2013,04,14
233,MAGNIFICENT!!,"One of the best stays I have enjoyed in a hotel. What can I say? Charming building, comfortable beds, great bedroom, spacious and immaculate bathroom, breakfast is just SUPERB!, but the best thing is, undoubtfully, the staff. They made everything they could to make my stay and my friends' stay the best. we were there for St paddys and it was great but Ariel House made it even better. Going to Dublin? Stay here!",5,2013,04,14
233,"Best hotel, and reasonable rates what's more","Amazing hotel. 

Staff: Friendly and fast. Excellent. 

Rooms: Spacious and well-decorated. Nice clean bathrooms. Excellent. 

Location: Just outside the city centre which is a very good thing, you can sleep peacefully. Right beside the DART train so you can get to the city centre quickly and economically. 

Price: Surprisingly affordable, much more than most city centre hotels. 

Breakfast was the best we'd had, and parking is included. 

All around a 5 star experience. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2013,04,14
233,Suosittelen,"WC, the pool not pulled, repaired immediately. Breakfast was fantastic. I do not recommend Dublin, 17.3. This was 2. trip to Ireland, i have to make 3. to let Ireland make me impsessed. Maybe I take my husband with me then.",5,2013,04,13
233,Very Nice and helpful staff,"The staff here is really quite nice and also very helpful in providing all you need and this is what really makes this place stand out.  Our room was adequate, not super nice but quaint and maintained.  The breakfast was great!  Servers went out of the way to provide gluten free options for one of our party and on the second day remembered and took care of it without asking.  The neighborhood is very quiet and in a good area, you will have no trouble sleeping from outside city sounds.  It's a nice walk into the heart of Dublin.",4,2013,04,11
233,WOW at Ariel House,"Wonderful, Outstanding Week at Ariel House. I stayed with my husband, and teenage daughter at Ariel House for five nights in March. We arrived early morning (8:00am) the day after St. Patricks day. We were very tired after a long trip. We were greeted by a friendly hotel worker who told us we could wait in the Drawing Room until our room would be ready later that day.(they were sold out the night before). Within 10 min. He came in and told us he could give us a small room to rest in, until our room was ready. We were greatful and went to the room. We were able to rest and were also offered breakfast. We were so tired, we declined, but had I known how wonderful there breakfast was I would have jumped at the offer. By noon our room was ready. It was a beautiful room, large, clean with lots of elegance and charm. Our stay was to be 3 nights, but we loved it so much we decided to make it 5 nights. The wonderful staff was able to arrange it for us, and we were able to stay in the same room. The breakfast was delicious, with lots of choices and very tasty. The breakfast staff was so pleasant and friendly. Ballsbrige, where Ariel House is located, is a beautiful area with lots of character and charm. We walked around the area but would ride the Dart to Dublin center, cause it was very cold for us. Ariel House itself is a beautiful Victorian style place and we didn't want to leave it. We stayed at 4 other places on our tour of Ireland, but by far Ariel house was really special. My only reget about this place is that it is so far from our house, but when I come back to Dublin, it will be the place I choose to stay! Thank you Ariel house for a great stay.",5,2013,04,09
233,Lovely,"Lovely guest house, 2minutes from dart train stop so literally 10 minutes to the city center.
Reception staff made us feel welcome from arrival, with great ideas for things to do, and help and advice for sis coving Dublin.
We had a lovely 3 person room (traveling with my two teenage daughters) in the main building.
The breakfast was as described in earlier post really delicious.
If we come back to Dublin we would certainly return!",5,2013,04,09
233,Great place to stay,We stayed at the Ariel hotel for one night. Very close to Aviva stadium. Very friendly and helpful staff. Great breakfast. What more do you need? A bit out of the way for central Dublin but has a DART close by or a 20 minute walk along pleasant Georgian streets.,5,2013,04,08
233,Absolutely fantastic service,"3 nights and first trip to Dublin.  Lots of great customer service including lovely breakfasts, recommending and booking restaurants ensuring we were treated very well when dining, recommendations for trips and hand written directions for little walking trips including getting from Kilmainhaim gaol to Guinness Storehouse.  Deirdre was a real help and with the team made our stay a great experience.  Prices very reasonable and location works well.",5,2013,04,06
233,"Great location, clean rooms and amazing breakfast!","We stayed for 5 nights in January 2013, and really enjoyed our experience.  We were delayed one day for our arrival, which was no problem for the staff and they were very accommodating for shifting our dates. The room was clean, bright and quiet.  The staff very friendly, with wonderful breakfasts (hot and cold) available daily.  This is a charming B&B in a great location for central Dublin. Would recommend for those who want a true B&B experience!",4,2013,04,05
233,Confused & Disappointed,"We traveled from the west of Ireland for a days relaxation & shopping in Dublin, but the main purpose of our stay was to experience Ariel House,,, and to our utter Disappointment we didn't get the chance. I phoned ahead to tell the person at reception that we would be late, that was at 5.30 pm, he assured me that was no problem. We arrived at Ariel House at 7.30 pm to be told by the gentleman at reception that he did not have a key for the room,as house keeping had not returned it to front desk, and he was also unsure if the room was ready,,, at 7.30????we were tired along with our little baby all we wanted was to experience the luxury we had read about in all the other reviews. We were shown to a ""family"" room as booked,,, it was down stairs and far from luxury, it was cramped,dark and dull and looked out on the rubbish bins.It was too small for 3 adults and a baby, we may as well have all been in the bed together, the bathroom was very narrow, the most 4ft wide. When we looked to check out, the gent at the reception said my card would possibly charged, I asked for a room change and was told all family rooms were booked and we could have two twin rooms which was double the price and not what I had booked over a week ago. We had to wait at least 30 minutes for a manageress to return a call to confirm we would not be charged,,,all in all it was not a good experience for us and this confuses me as to how we got the bad luck with our room comparing to so many other rave reviews.",1,2013,04,02
233,Virtual perfection,"Although we had read stellar reviews about Ariel House before booking, everything about it by far exceeded our expectations: the Old-World charm of the room was perfection; the four-poster bed was supremely comfortable; the furnishings (pictures, furniture, drapes & upholstery) all rounded out the period charm; the spacious, well-equipped bathroom was an ideal complement to the large, comfortable bedroom; the toiletries & bathrobe which were provided were much appreciated; the personal warmth as well as professionalism of the staff can’t get higher marks; the delicious & healthy breakfast served in the conservatory was simply beyond words; and the topping on the cake is the location (the proximity to Dublin, with ease of access to the city thanks to both bus & train just yards away) plus the immediate neighborhood is filled with restaurants and shops to delight any visitor.  We can't recommend it highly enough.",5,2013,04,02
233,Breakfast is the reason to stay here!,"We had the best breakfast in Ireland at this hotel. Food was creative and delicious. The rooms are very dark, although very clean. The mattress was a little lumpy. The bathroom was tiny and only one person at a time could be in there.
Location is perfect - Far enough out of Dublin Centre to be quiet and yet close enough to walk.
Staff was very friendly and helpful!",4,2013,04,01
233,Fabulous Hotel,"We stumbled upon this hotel when doing an online search many years ago.  We have stayed on several occasions and would highly recommend it.

It is situated in a lovely residential area in Ballsbridge, within walking distance of the centre of Dublin and only 5 min walk to the Aviva Stadium - so excellent location for when attending concerts.  The hotel also has private parking facilities.

We have had several rooms at the far end of the hotel and even a room with a four poster bed – all with top of the range en-suite.

The breakfast served is excellent, with a wide variety of continental items to choose from and very helpful staff to take your order. 

Altogether a lovely chic hotel which I would def recommend to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in Dublin.",5,2013,04,01
233,Ariel House - great location!,"We loved the location of this hotel since it is close to the city centre, but not right in the city. It was easy to get on the Dart and be in the city within minutes. Breakfast was great each morning as well. Our check in was a bit rushed and I had to ask about how to access wi fi. There was also some confusion by the staff as to what was open or closed on Good Friday. We were told that most restaurants would be closed...we took a chance and found that the majority of restaurants in the city were open. I would think a local hotel should know this. Otherwise, we had a very nice stay. I also really liked the coffee and treats available in the afternoons.",4,2013,03,31
233,Lovely B&B in a beautiful part of Dublin,"We recently stayed at this property for 2 nights and had a wonderful time.  The house is located on Lansdowne in the Ballsbridge area, just near the rugby stadium, many posh restaurants and the majority of embassies in Dublin.  It is a terrific walking area and very safe.  The hotel is staffed 24 hours, so checking in and out is a breeze.  Everyone was super helpful and friendly.  They have a wonderful breakfast room, with selections off a menu (the smoked salmon Eggs Benedict was awesome!) as well as a huge spread of scones, breads, cheeses, cereals and juices. We also loved the complimentary morning newspaper. In addition, they have afternoon tea/coffee and sweets out every day in their beautiful front parlor.  Our room – called the George Bernard Shaw suite (room 222) – was very large by European standards.  Including the bathroom!  And the price is very competitive.  Our observations regarding improvements would be small things - the furnishings are a bit aged and could use an update, the water pressure was bad (but that is not too uncommon in Ireland), the TV had to be turned on manually, and, most annoying, that the WiFi is very inconsistent and the signal poor in the rooms.  Despite these items, however, we will certainly stay here again on our future visits.",4,2013,03,30
233,Great for Dublin,"We had trouble getting to Ariel House because there was a football match at the Aviva Stadium that night, and the police blockade the access roads. After driving round in circles a few times, one of the police finally let us drive down Lansdowne Road to a great B&B. There's off street parking and an elegant lounge with piano, sofas, complimentary cakes, and tea and coffee. Very atmospheric for an after dinner wind down before bed. The room we had was spacious and comfortable, immaculate, and good breakfast. Located a few minutes from the station, and a short train ride into central Dublin.",5,2013,03,26
233,We would definitely love to stay here again,"A lovely quiet place to stay. Excellent wi-fi, beautiful rooms and delicious breakfast.   The reception is open 24 hours.  Not sure how far public transport is, but with a car we found the location to be very convenient.",5,2013,03,24
233,A very pleasant stay,"Usually I stay in hotels when away but due to very positive reviews of Ariel House and it's excellent value, I chose a B&B on this occasion and I'm glad I did. Having a 24 hour reception desk proved a great bonus. Very relaxed atmosphere, with very friendly, helpful and accommodating staff. Breakfast was delicious with lots of choice and home made cuisine. Rooms very comfortable and clean. It is a very good location yet quiet. Highly recommended.",5,2013,03,23
233,Good Location & Value,"We stayed here for a short three-night trip in Dublin and it was a good stay.  The location is great: within easy walking distance of the train station, and the bus system.  It's located within the Embassy area of Dublin, so the neighborhood is quiet, and there are a few nice restaurants nearby.  The staff was very friendly, and did their best to be helpful to us.  

There were a few things lacking in the finer details though.  There was a heavy layer of dust on the ceiling fixtures, and mold stains on the bathroom.  In terms of service, when we asked for directions to a restaurant recommended in the concierge packet provided by the guest house, the concierge had no idea where it was, had to look it up, and then gave somewhat confusing directions.  Our stay was not terrible by any means, but these few lackluster details did have an impact.  

Overall, I would definitely recommend Ariel House for anyone staying in Dublin.  It's a good value and there are a lot of great things about it.",4,2013,03,22
233,Short Break,"Having read the very positive trip advisor reviews we had a high expectation prior to arriving at the Ariel House and we were not disappointed. Dublin was cold and wet for a good part of our stay, so coming back to our warm and spacious room was a treat. The hotel has a really friendly feeling and the staff are both efficient and keen to help. It must be said that the highly commended breakfast was excellent, the full irish was fantastic and other variants just as good. We intend to come back to Dublin in the summer and will definitely stay at the Ariel House again. Very good value and a 20 min stroll from the city centre.",4,2013,03,22
233,Excellent,"When staying in Dublin, I have always opted to stay in hotels.  However this time I looked for the post code and the area, and took advise from clients, and found Ariel House.  I went onto their website, called the guest house and after answering my questions without having to put me through to another department, I decided to book there and then.
The room was stunning, and so big.  It made a lovely change to have a bath as well as a shower in the bathroom.  The breakfast was simply amazing and the level of standard was second to none.  It also helped that they had car parking for a few cars, which was brilliant.  The house had so much character as it was so old, and the location was perfect, near to all clients and so close to the Aviva stadium should I wish to go back for a pleasure trip.  Staff were also very attentive and helpful.  This will be my new home whenever in Dublin from now on.",5,2013,03,21
233,Good location and value in Dublin,"We stayed 2 nights at the Ariel House last November.  It is in a good location.  The staff is helpful.  The rooms are a bit tight and the layout of the hotel is odd, but still a good place to stay in Dublin.  The breakfast is delicious and the service is good.  I would have appreciated some help with our luggage.  You have stairs to enter the hotel and we had to take 2 sets of stairs to get to our room.  We had 4 pieces of luggage and two small children in tow which made it a bit tricky, but we managed.  Overall, we would stay there again.  Dublin is a great city to visit.",4,2013,03,17
233,great place to stay,"We recently stayed at Ariel House, our second visit!! what a lovey friendly hotel, we were travelling on the ferry with an early start so this is the perfect place to stay as its just a few minutes to the ferry.We stayed here last year and had a minor problem which I rang and told the manager about and she said we were to have afternoon tea on the house as an apoligy when we came again, this we decided to have when we arrived and what a spread it was, all absolutely lovely and more than made up for our small problem. The room was very comfortable so we slept well before our early start for the ferry, we will be sure to stay here on our next trip",5,2013,03,16
233,Lovely with wonderful staff,"We just left after a 3 day stay at Ariel House. Our room was comfortable, clean, and cozy. The bathroom was large and very modern. The staff was very hospitable and kind. Finally, the breakfast was divine. We loved our stay and definitely would return.",5,2013,03,15
233,Clean and welcoming,"Situated a couple of hundred meters from the Aviva Stadium on Lansdowne Road in the Ballsbridge district, Ariel House is easy to find by car.  There is limited free parking in the grounds, and parking onstreet is restricted from 8.30am to early evening to residents and those with blue mobility badges. The DART station is beside the stadium and offers frequent connections into the city centre.

The welcome is warm, the premises are old but clean, nicely decorated in the public areas and comfortable.  Ariel House is certainly not a hotel, but more a high end B&B, and it's a shame they don't offer lunches or evening meals. Complimentary fresh cakes and fancies are available in the lounge.

The decor in the room we used was slightly dated, with 'old' and 'period' furniture being the style.  Having said that, the bed was very comfortable and the room itself (239) on the ground floor was large and overlooking the back garden.  It was, however, poorly lit by badly positioned ceiling lights.  Bedside lights were fine though.  The TV was so far away from the bed it was barely watchable, but that may be relevant only to this particular room.  A larger screen size would have sorted this out simply and easily.  Tea and coffee making facilities are provided in the room.

The bathroom was large, with a corner bath and separate shower cubicle, but had no external ventilation and was unbearably hot inside on our arrival.  We turned off the heated towel rail/radiator and waited a few hours for things to cool down.  Complimentary toiletries are a welcome addition.  Towels were clean and soft.

As has been mentioned in many previous reviews the food at breakfast was excellent and more than that offered by many other establishments we've stayed in.  

I would say this accommodation would suit just about any genre of traveller except perhaps families with small children.  We would intend to return when next staying in Dublin.",5,2013,03,15
233,The luck of the Irish to have such a gem!,"Having worked for an airline in my youth, it's safe to say I have stayed at many hotels, Inns and BB's through out the years.  This was my first trip to Ireland with my daughters and our friends and I was hoping that the Ariel house would be a good experience as nothing can kill a vacation like a bad accomodation.  Well to our delight we fell in love with this place.  We were a party of six and reserved two rooms.  Both rooms were quite spacious and had nice views.  The old world charm of the house was comfortable and relaxing.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly.  There was always someone at the desk and all you needed to do was ask and they would help you with whatever you needed.  The Irish breakfast was scrumptious and served by a lovely young lady. Also free Wifi
For those who are looking for modern bathrooms and fancy furniture, you maybe disappointed. But if your looking for warm, kind people and a comfortable lovely old world charm stay, you found your place.  Also the location is lovely",5,2013,03,11
233,Let down by room quality,"Firstly let me say that we enjoyed our time at Ariel House, and we would definitely return, but we were disappointed with the suite we stayed in. On its own we would have rated the room as a '3' because the furniture was very tired - not sure about it being antique unless antique just means old. The dark wood wardrobe had an unfinished bit of ply as a handle, the drawer was falling apart, the settee and chair were grubby and had seen better days and there was woefully inadequate storage for clothes. One drawer! Liveable for a couple of days but no longer. Also the tiling around the bath was very tacky, and don't get me started on the water pressure. More of a trickle than a shower. Bed was very comfortable though.
That's the negative bit. Everything else was great. It's an attractive house with high-ceilinged elegant rooms. The staff are extremely polite and helpful and nothing is too much trouble. And the breakfast! Well, all I can say is that it was the best breakfast we'd had, anywhere. The poached eggs and salmon are to die for. There's home-made bread and pastries available, and the home-made soda bread was lovely. The dining room is perhaps a little cosy and does get very busy, meaning we had to wait one morning, but all is forgiven when you see the food!
It's a fair walk into the city centre but a pleasant one. If you're visiting the Aviva stadium it's a perfect location. Just a few minutes walk from the Dart station too.
So overall we'd return, which kind of sums it up really, but would book a Superior Room (which we had a peek at), not a suite. Then I would expect to be able to give it a '5' overall.",4,2013,03,08
233,Treated like Family,"Myself and two of my children have been anticipating our stay in Dublin at the Ariel House since booking our reservation. We were treated like family from the minute we walked in the door.We traveled overnight and were quite exhausted when we arrived. Deidre offered us a seat in the front sitting room while she checked on our room. When it was not going to be available she offered us another room to nap in until ours was ready. Wow! When we awakened from our nap our room was ready. It was spacious , Immaculate, and the two large windows looked out on the lovely neighborhood outside. A plus we could open those windows if we wanted fresh air. The room was immaculately clean. The bath room quite large. (Room 223 if you are interested in that) The beds were comfortable. As with others comments the water pressure was low but I have encountered this in much of my international travel and consider this conservation. There was a towel warmer that seemed to be on a timer and towels were warmed at the time of my am shower. 
Back toy our first day. Once we were fully rested , we offered a variety of beautiful and Delicious cakes and a glass of champagne. These tasty treats were available daily and I felt like the we anticipated relative of someone who had been looking forward to seeing us with anticipation. We ate breakfast everyday except one when our daily plans had us up very early. The dining room was lovely with a beautiful glass seating area as well. The full Irish breakfast, pancakes, and Herby scrambled eggs were wonderful ways to start our days. This is coming from a person who has had many compliments on her ""American"" breakfast. Its my families favorite meal of the day and the food and the hospitality of the Ariel staff made us feel so welcomed. 
We felt very safe the entire time we were here. We stayed 5 nights. We both walked and used public transportation to visit about Dublin. Both were pleasant and easy to use. Cabs were easy to catch. The walk was safe and pleasant and the bus stops were easy to find. 
I would highly recommend staying here and will look no further in the future when in Dublin.",5,2013,03,02
233,Excellent service!,"4 of us stayed in Ariel house for 2 nights and it was a lovely hotel. The owner and staff were the best part always helpful and when we had a few difficulties they were quick to resolve.

The hotel is further than we thought from centre however the train station was 2 mins away and the return journey into city was around 3-4 euros! It was a great for a little sight seeing as well and only took 10mins. Walking takes 30mins but is a intetesting walk with lots of sights to see on the way.

Rooms were nice and had what you needed for a couple of nights. 

Breakfast was fab, lots of variety and great cooked breakfast.

On our checkout the staff offered to fill flasks for long journey home and added some lovely homemade scones. A extra special touch!",5,2013,03,01
233,fab...fab...fab,"perfect...very clean, friendly staff, great breakfast and fantastic room, would recomend the oscar wilde room its huge with a really nice bathroom...afternoon tea/coffee and cakes were delicious, the DART is only 2 min walk away.....would def recommend to anyone who is going to dublin, you will not be dissapointed.",5,2013,03,01
233,Wonderful Breakfast overcomes low water pressure,"My wife, two daughters and I recently returned from a three night stay at Ariel House.  It's a nice Victorian boutique hotel with exceptionally friendly staff.  We chose this as a good place to explore Dublin and we weren't disappointed.  The family room was equipped with two beds and was quite spacious.  It contained an iron/ironing board, hair dryer, hot pot with tea/coffee, and plenty of pillows.  The only downside was the low water pressure in the shower, but we adjusted.

The hotel is a pleasant 20 minute walk to St. Stephen's Green.  There is a convenience store, Starbucks, and Subway just down the block if you want something quick and easy.  The breakfast in the hotel was among the best that I've ever had.  My wife particularly enjoyed the pancakes with creme freche and fresh berries.

We will definately stay here again on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2013,03,01
233,"Good Breakfast, Rooms Need Work","We just returned from three nights in this lovely guest house.

Our room and bathroom were clean, though much of the furniture was falling apart.  There was very limited storage space, and the crown of the armoire was not secured so it kept sliding from side to side.

A note about Irish toilets - flush with a firm and quick push on the lever, otherwise the toilet will not empty.  Also, the toilets take quite a while to refill, so be prepared to not flush too many times in a row (for example, if you have multiple people staying in one hotel room).  The staff was fairly responsive to this problem and even brought out a plumber to investigate why our toilet only flushed once every twenty minutes or so. . . but in the end we were told that the toilet was just fine.  (!)

This hotel is located further from the city center than we had thought it might be, and we found the bus system difficult to navigate due to a lack of bus maps.  We wound up making the 30 minute walk each way to and from town most days because of this trouble with the buses, which really cut into our touring time.

The breakfast, however, is excellent.  Fresh fruit, hot homemade scones, pancakes made to order, and the best porridge I have ever eaten.  If you find the room disappointing, the breakfast will make up for it!

The staff was generally friendly and helpful.  We found the ""double"" bed quite small compared to ""double"" beds throughout the rest of Europe.

If we visit Dublin again, I think we will try to stay closer to the city center.",3,2013,02,26
233,Excellent choice for Dublin stay,"This is a perfect hotel for a stay in Dublin. We had one night here selected on TA reviews and they were spot on. Access from the DART was 2 minutes walk and there were also buses for the city & airport that also stopped nearby. Our room wasn't quite ready when we checked in at lunchtime. This was no problem though as our bags were looked after and subsequently delivered to our room and there was hot drinks and cake available in the residents lounge in the afternoon which was a very nice touch.
Our room was very large, warm and extremely comfortable. The staff were extremely helpful both before our stay and throughout and the breakfast was superb and lined us up nicely for our flight and journey home to Norwich. Would definately recommend Ariel House to anyone staying in Dublin and not just for events at AVIVA stadium and the RDS.",5,2013,02,22
233,Great Dublin hotel,"Jst came back from a one night stay at this Hotel. As always did my research on TA and was not let down. Perfect position for Exhibition Centre. Elegant Victorian House. Very comfortable room but outdated bathroom and cheapish toiletries. Great breakfast and very friendly staff.
Next time in Dublin whether pleasure or business will stay here againg.",5,2013,02,21
233,what a lovely guesthouse,"Very impressed all round with this cracking place. We booked board only and didn't venture into the dinning room on our stay although it is highly rated. Staff very friendly and professional also helpful. The room was very tasteful in keeping with the whole theme through out the guesthouse and we found it to be clean and in good condition. It seemed to be used by business and family guests and located in a rather nice area, a bit of a walk into Dublin centre but we did it every day on our stay without struggle. Very happy",5,2013,02,19
233,Comfortable and Convenient,"Stayed at the Ariel House a couple of weeks ago for one night on business. This is not the type of place I would normally book for leisure, as it does not have the amenities I usually look for (like a bar.) 

However, as the company was paying I always look for best value. I think I would describe the Ariel more of a guest house than a hotel. 

I had a meeting in south Dublin the following day. The location of the Ariel was ideal. It is a few hundred yards from an airport bus stop and the Aviva stadium with its DART station are just a drop kick away. Ballsbridge where the Ariel is located seems to be a prosperous suburb and there were several dining options a short walk away had I not chosen to go into An Lar.

The room was spacious and had character but somewhat plain in decor. It was perfectly adequate for my purposes. 

The complimentary Wi-Fi was fast and reliable. The front desk staff were welcoming and helpful. I did not take breakfast.",4,2013,02,19
233,Break away for the Rugby,"Excellent location close to the AVIVA and a short walk into town. Staff were excellent and the breakfast was one of the best spreads I have seen, all locally based produce made for a delicious start to the day! Rooms were excellent and well kitted out. Only problem was the TV bracket wasn't long enough to rotate, so it was uncomfortable viewing. Otherwise an excellent place to stay and will definitely return!",5,2013,02,13
233,Perfect for a family,"The family stayed here for a long weekend, beginning of February. Everything was just perfect, close to a bus stop when coming from the Airport. Very nice, welcoming and helpful staff. The breakfast was excellent. We were so glad to see that the breakfast was about quality instead of quantity, delicious cooked breakfast, cheese, home baked bread and cakes and everything from what seemed too be local suppliers, just worth the stay to have breakfast. In fact the whole family longed for the breakfast in the evening. We have stayed in many hotels but this gem is one of the best, it's not the most luxurious but it is quality, Irish and just a 20 minute walk from St Stephens Green or 5 minutes from the train station. We will for sure stay here next time we visit Dublin.",5,2013,02,09
233,Great place.,We stayed for one night( family of 4).Graet location 2mins from Dart Station(about 10mins from City center by train) and next to Aviva stadium for footbal and rugby matches.Small Georgian style hotel with 37 bedrooms.Our family room was big enough with bathroom and small tv.Very quiet in the night time despite the Ireland vs Poland game held on that evening.Nice staff and tasty breakfast in the morning.Lovely cakes and biscuits complimentary in the afternoon.There is no bar in the hotel -that is why 4 out of 5.Recommended!,4,2013,02,08
233,Enjoyable stays,"My friend and I stayed here last weekend and we it was wonderful. The location is very handy, quiet and safe. What most reviewers have been saying about Aerial House are true - its has the best breakfast in town and would guarantee you an enjoyable stays.",5,2013,02,03
233,Great place to stay in Dublin,"We stayed here for 5 nights and can highly recommend this hotel. The breakfast is excellent with a wide variety of choice to suit all tastes.

All the staff are exceptionally friendly and extremely helpful. The lady at the front desk gave us lots of really useful tips and suggestions about places to visit nearby that you would not normally find on the regular tourist lists. For example, you can take the train from the station across the road from the hotel, to visit places along the coast like Dalkey, Sandycove and Howth. 

It is easy to get to the city centre by taxi, DART train, bus or a brisk walk of about 20 minutes.",5,2013,01,26
233,"Fabulous Staff, Accommodation & Breakfast","Great location - we were in Dublin to go to the O2, 15 minute walk.  We had bought a 3 day transport pass (28 euro) from airport, which included coach into city, all buses in Dublin plus hop on hop off sightseeing bus, which was great with live commentary & stopped at 24 suggested tourist spots (can reccomend Kilmainham Goal).  Staff were wonderful, checked our return flights (snow in the UK!) helpful for trip suggestions & restaurants (Chop House 5 mins walk was amazing for steak).  Breakfast was fantastic.  Room & bed great, not amazing on the tea/coffee or bathroom freebies, but tea & cake available in drawing room.",5,2013,01,24
233,"Great Hotel, Nice Location","I booked a room here upon reading the reviews on tripadvisor. I certainly wasn't disappointed. The Hotel is located in a nice suburb but isn't too far away from the centre (Also quite near to the o2). I think a taxi from the centre was about €11 but there is also a DART station close by, where you can get into the centre in under 10 minutes for €3.50 return.

The room was clean, spacious and had a great homely feel to it. The bathroom was huge with separate shower cubicle and bath tub. The WiFi connection was fairly reliable, although I did have to keep logging in.

The breakfast was excellent, on both occasions I opted for the Irish Breakfast and whilst the portions might be considered small, they were surprisingly filling. Excellent service, too.

The staff were all wonderfully polite and were very helpful when organising taxis etc.

In order to be balanced, the only possible improvements I could think of would probably to have a safe in the rooms, although this isn't really a necessity. A smoking area outside (well mainly somewhere clear to dispose of ends). Also, whilst I suppose having physical keys adds to the places charm, I do find key cards less of a hassle to look after.

All in all a great place to stay in a nice neighbourhood in a more relaxed part of the city.",5,2013,01,23
233,Outstanding,"Fantastic stay at Ariel House. From the moment we stepped in Famey at reception was absolutly first class. Warm, welcoming and helpful. We felt right at home. The room was perfect and cozy. Very comfortable bed and breakfast was delicious. The staff in the morning were equally as professional! 10 out of 10. I couldn't fault Ariel House. We will be back.",5,2013,01,22
233,A Lovely Place to Stay in Dubin,"There's probably not much to add to the previous positive reviews of Ariel House.  The staff was uniformly excellent; always friendly and personable.  After notifying them that my flight would arrive in Dublin mid-morning,  I was able to occupy my room well before noon, rather than having to wait until later in the day.   Ariel House is located just a few steps away from a DART stop, and it's an easy and enjoyable walk to the city center, too.  One convenience is a nearby Centra store on Shelbourne Road, which has an ATM (note: you can swipe your debit card, rather than having the machine swallow it whole and return it to you, something I personally find a bit suspenseful), and it also sells Dublin bus passes.  Breakfast was very good.  A nice touch is the availability of coffee or tea in the parlor in the late afternoon.  It's nice to come back after a day of exploring Dublin and sit and unwind there.",5,2013,01,20
233,Great value,"My girlfriend and I stayed here two nights. Amazing breakfast! The hotel is located in short distance to the DART train, two stops away from Pearse st. Unfortunately there was only cold water in the shower the first morning, but the staff was very service minded and let us take a shower in an available room straight away. As compensation we got one of the two breakfasts we had for free! That's excellent service! A stay in this old Victorian town house is highly recommended! ",5,2013,01,19
233,What a place,"We stayed in the offseason, and since the place was less than full, they upgraded us for no cost. The room was more than we could have asked for, and we got it for a phenomenal price. It is a neat, old building with Victorian furnishings, and it was beyond comfortable. The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. They made great restaurant suggestions, in addition to helping us with various needs throughout our brief stay. And the food. Ohhhh, the food. I booked our stay based partially on the understanding that they had great breakfasts, and I was not disappointed. The afternoon tea was also a delight. What an extraordinary stay. It is a terrific place and an even better value.",5,2013,01,18
233,ariel house dublin,"very nice hotel staff always happy to help and nothing seems to much trouble, breakfast was always presented to a very high standard with lots of choice.lovely home made cakes and bread in the lounge.transport to and from dublin centre by dart is very easy and fast,2 min walk to the station.local pubs nice and friendly would stay again and have recomended to family and friends",5,2013,01,14
233,Lovely place,"Had a wonderful overnight stay in this hotel.  Lovely safe quiet area.  Central to all amenities, transport and good restaurants etc,   Breakfast lives up to all expectations.   Fresh, cooked perfectly and excellent choice. Bedrooms were clean but extractor in bathroom didn't work.  Staff where friendly and helpful.  Would come back again.  However my mother who came with me found the stairs and entrance steps bit too much for her so would not recommend for those with disabilities issues. ",4,2013,01,05
233,Highly Recommended,"Stayed in Ariel House for one night in December as I was going to be out late at a function.   I was in a beautiful comfortable and relaxing room (the Jonathan Swift) and the location was perfect for the function I was attending.

Service was exceptional, all staff were friendly without being intrusive.

Breakfast the next day was excellent and the few of us who stayed were chatting about the night before long after breakfast was finished.   Rather than ask us to leave so they could tidy up,  the staff constantly asked us if we wanted more tea, coffee, scones etc and left us chatting.

If I have visitors coming to Dublin, I will recommend they stay here rather for a personal touch than some faceless hotel chain for the same price.

Overall, excellent value for money in a very nice part of Dublin.",5,2012,12,30
233,Peaceful location and breakfast to die for,"My friend and I stayed at Ariel House for 4 nights in early December and have fond memories of the place.
Although some have complained about the distance from the city centre (about 2 kilometres), we found the walk to town relaxing. I have mobility issues but the walk was a breeze. If you're not fond of walking, there's a DART station nearby.
The rooms are furnished with antique furniture. Our room was cleaned daily. The only downside to the rooms (at least at the main house) is that they are quite dark: our room had only one floor lamp and two table lamps (+ bathroom lights) so arriving at the hotel when the sun had set posed some challenges, especially after visits to the Guinness Storehouse and the Jameson Distillery... Another small gripe was water pressure when taking a shower, especially if you wanted warm water. It took about a half an hour to wash my short hair. My friend (who has long hair) had to wash her locks by filling the tub as otherwise it would have taken forever to take a shower. Because the bathroom was cold, taking a warm shower with non-existant water pressure was a chilly experience.
The beds were comfy and the complimentary wifi enabled us to check travel information online. As the b&b is situated in a quiter neighbourhood, we got a good night's rest every night and woke up every morning envigorated and ready for new adventures.
The breakfast was delicious and plentiful. In addition to buffet breakfast of cereal, muesli, yoghurt, bread and other pastries, a selection of a la carte items is included in the room price. One day we gorged on pancakes, the next day we had salmon and pouched eggs.. Everything was yummy and fresh.
In all Ariel House is a definite b&b gem. We stayed in a superior twin room and it cost 79 euros per night per room. If you want a comfortable stay and enjoy excellent breakfasts, Ariel House is the place for you.",4,2012,12,27
233,"Excellent, would stay again. Highly recommended!","We stayed at Ariel house for five nights and it couldn't have been better. 

The staff are helpful, considerate and friendly and made us feel welcome straight away. The room was comfortable and spacious, including a desk a beautiful wardrobe. Wifi was available in the room, and there was also a lounge downstairs with tea, coffee and mince pies for Christmas! There are newspapers available and the location is good. 

There are a host of pubs and restaurants just up the street (though avoid Jewel in the Crown), as well as a convenient deli and a Starbucks. You can walk into the main centre of Dublin within about half an hour, otherwise the dart is also about a three minute walk away.

Ariel House is great if you want to stay in, and conveniently located if you want to explore or find a good place to eat.

I would definitely stay here again, and strongly recommend it.",5,2012,12,24
233,Very nice and welcoming,"We loved it here. The staff are friendly and helpful and the house is comfortable and charming. Our room was nice, good beds, TV, heating, tea and coffee facilities, all the usual comforts. There is also a lounge area which is a pleasant place to sit and read or use the wifi, and take advantage of the complimentary coffee, tea, cakes and newspapers.

The location is absolutely fine by our standards. There are dozens of places to eat, drink and shop for supplies nearby and it only takes about 30-40 minutes to walk into the city centre.

Highly recommended, will hopefully stay again!",5,2012,12,24
233,"Great hotel, but a little out of the way","I was first skeptical when the airport bus driver dropped us off last and thought we had ended up in the middle of nowhere, but the warm reception, great service, fabulous breakfast and proximity to the DART urban rail service into the city centre make this a hotel I would easily go back to. The rooms were clean, the staff very friendly and the stay overall very pleasant. As for its location, the hotel is  less than a two minute walk to the Lansdown Road DART station, which is two stops and roughly five minutes from the city centre.",4,2012,12,22
233,Good Place to stay,"Stayed here early December, extremely convenient for everything, 15 minute walk to Grafton Street, Temple Bar. Aviva Stadium adjacent so would be worth checking if there was a game on, or book early if there is a game you want to see. Breakfast good but very small.
Good restaurant 'The Chop House' 5 minutes walk.",4,2012,12,21
233,Okay place far from tourist sites and bus.,I stayed here for 3 nights in November.  It is looking a bit shabby.  Our room was okay.  Breakfast was good but not enough to make me stay here again.  The worst things were first the distance to town.  I walked it each time and it was long and confusing.  Also we took a bus from the airport and it seemed a long way to pull my luggage.  When leaving the bus was late and it was very inconvenient.  I must admit that somewhere closer to city center would have suited us better.,3,2012,12,16
233,Wonderful experience.,"I recently had the good fortune to stay in this wonderful establishment. The Owner and staff are just wonderful, Everyone so helpful and genuinely caring. I was accompanied by 4 adult family members and from the time we arrived it was just like being at home. Clean comfortable rooms-could hear no street noise. Just a stones-throw from Ireland's AVIVA stadium-the venue for international rugby and soccer. Situated in the leafy suburb of Dublin 4, it is still only a short bus ride to city centre.The breakfast was excellent-quite a choice which included vegetarian and of course -the Full Irish.A lovely touch is the waiting room adjacent to front of house which has tea/coffee on call but adds little biscuits and cakes without charge for guests. You had a feeling of being well looked after throughout the stay. I forgot to mention the sign displayed which proudly states that the hotel was awarded their number one rating bt Tripadvisor. and I must say that I agree with that choice. Rates are reasonable also.All in all-a wonderful experience.",5,2012,12,14
233,Nice stay,"We arrived early in the morning to Dublin, for our 2 night stay at Ariel House. The staff did everything they could to get us checked in early. Although we waited for a while, their efforts were very kind. The was very big and was kept very clean and comfortable. We were on the bottom floor, and it seemed to be newly renovated. It was one of the few placed we stayed that had an iron and ironing board. The food was so-so compared to other B&B's that we stayed at. Overall, it was a good experience. Only a block away from the DART and a 10 minute walk to the Airport bus. The is really no easy way to get to the city center though.",4,2012,12,12
233,I would recommend this hotel,Just returned from our weekend in Dublin and we would fully recommend this hotel. All round very good quality hotel.  Good value for money. Excellent breakfast menu. Free coffee and cakes in the drawing room was a bonus! Friendly staff. Great location - 2 minutes walk from the Dart.,4,2012,12,12
233,Absolutely Fabulous!,"Have just returned from staying in Dublin at Ariel House and it was just fabulous. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left it was special. The decor was elegant, the service impeccible and the food to die for. The breakfast was delicious with a choice you would not receive in many well-known hotels and beautifully presented. The staff were so helpful (especially the manageress) ensuring our evening meal was booked for us as we were out for the day and attending to our every need. We had to change our original booking as illness prevented some of our party from attending and this was graciously done without any fuss.
Thank-you.
I am hoping to return with my husband in February for a short break and am already excited about enjoying such superb hospitality again. 
Cannot recommend Ariel House enough!",5,2012,12,10
233,Excellent!!,"We really enjoyed our stay at Ariel House.  The staff were so helpful and the rooms were lovely.  We were most amazed by the fantastic breakfast menu, all of which was delicious.  On arrival we were given fresh tea and warm scones!  

It has a great location close to the Aviva Stadium, Dart Station & the RDS.

I normally stay elsewhere when we go to Dublin but from now on I will be staying in Ariel House!",5,2012,12,10
233,"What a fabulous find, thank you so much.","Fantastic location, wonderful people, great breakfast and those little extra touches that mean so much.  Keep your big impersonal hotels, Aries house is Dublin hospitality at its best and a place to cherish.  5 minutes walk to the RDS,  1 min walk to the dart, 3 stops to the city centre.  We will be back very soon, thank you.",5,2012,12,09
233,elegant comfort,"We stayed overnight here, choosing Ariel House for its convenience to the ferry ports from which we were to sail the next morning. We were amazed at the elegant period charm of the decor and furniture, which in our room included a four poster bed. The staff were very friendly and helpful and our only regret was that the earliness of our ferry precluded us from enjoying what I am sure would have been a super breakfast. I cannot recommend Ariel House highly enough - superb!",5,2012,12,08
233,A beautiful place and well worth the price!,"I would have to agree with all the recent reviews about the service, cleanliness, staff, and rooms.  All were top notch. 

Things to be aware of in general;  (1) Internet is horrible - it is like being in the 1990's, there is no excuse for it to be that spotty and slow in this day and age.  You would constantly have to sign-on and reconnect with username and password, which took awhile each time and drop out every 10 minutes at best. (2) Water pressure is non-existent. I took a shower at night and earlier in the morning and it is just so weak.  I don't think much can be done about it though?

I gave a 4 out of 5 star, only because of those two issues. I would recommend, unless the Internet is very important to you as it was for me. 

Request room 222 if possible.  George Bernard Shaw Room.  It was simply beautiful.",4,2012,12,04
233,Victorian setting with all the conveniences,"We were delighted with our stay at Ariel house.  In addition to being quiet and welcoming, the rooms were very clean and nicely appointed.  The beds were comfortable, and all the breakfast options were delicious. It is centrally located; a 20 minute walk to O2, Marrion Square, and a pleasant river walk.  It is within ten minutes walk of several excellent restaurants. Trains, buses and taxis are all easily available. The staff members are all very professional and helpful.  We enjoy B & Bs, and Ariel house is now top on our list!",5,2012,12,02
233,"Nice neighbourhood, awesome breakfast","The location is perfect: although it is still i walking distance from many of Dublin's attractions, it is in a nice, green residential area (Ballsbridge). It is also very close to the DART station, so you can be downtown in 5 minures. The service was good, the staff was helpful and they serve a very nice breakfast with a huge choice. They have a nice tea room, where  It was a nice change from the uniformity of chain hotels.",4,2012,12,02
233,"Clean and quiet, yes? Then this is for you.","We always value a quiet area, and this was spot on. Ariel House is a clean and friendly place to hang out while checking dublin. 2 min walk to the subway, 15-20 mins to the centre of town, its perfect. It has brilliant and varied breakfast, something we scandinavians like. Very serviceminded and kind, we got great help and a nice discount on our carhire, all we had to do was ask them to book it for us. A deserved winner this year - 2012.",5,2012,11,27
233,"Beautiful breakfast, comfortable beds and leafy suburbia","A lovely stay in Dublin with friends was enhanced by a perfect stay at Ariel house. It was warm, welcoming and served up the best hotel breakfast I've ever had! As important as the breakfast - the gorgeously comfortable beds were a godsend after a busy day and night in Dublin. It was relaxing to head out of town into leafy streets with local pubs and restaurants, a great location, we could have stayed much longer",5,2012,11,26
233,"Absolutely beautiful, loved it!","I stayed here this weekend from Friday 16th November - Monday 19th November with my boyfriend. The guest house is located 1minutes walk from the dart station on a beautiful tree lined street in a very nice neighbourhood. We were really impressed with how the outside of the guesthouse looked, its a quite grand victorian building. We had arrived early to leave our bags off and head out to explore, we were offered tea/coffee and there were a selection of homemade cakes etc. in the main sitting room -(they are made daily and placed in the sitting room for guests- along with a cook book opened at the page of the recipe for that day - which i think is a lovely touch.. and shows attention to detail that you don't get with other hotels) the sitting room is traditional but beautifully decorated with a large chandelier and grand piano. we headed out and returned later to be shown to our room. We were in room 232 as far as I can remember? A beautiful room at the front of the guesthouse with huge windows, really clean and grand. The bathroom was really modern and clean with lots of fresh towels and a bath / power shower. We were both really pleasantly surprised. The guest info packs were great for local amenities, and everything was explained in great detail. Anytime we passed reception - staff were extremely friendly and kind. On Sunday the night receptionist assisted us with directions to local shops and couldn't have been nicer. Overall I could not find a single fault. I would highly recommend and I would 100% stay here again. Loved it!",5,2012,11,19
233,Use it its worth it!,Four couples had a fabulous time worth the visit - shower poor but updates due apparently. Breakfast outstanding and service absolutely first rate. Excellent location good for the aviva stadium and the walk into town is only 20 minutes strolling. You will really like this place - trust me.,4,2012,11,18
233,"Great location, friendly staff.","We had a wonderful experience at this hotel.  The location is great, we were looking for something away from the noise of the city, but with easy access to the city.  This hotel is a block away from the train that has direct access to the city.  Breakfast was nice, although not the best we had on that trip.  We were also upgraded to a larger room, which was a nice surprise.  The staff also helped my husband to buy flowers, chocolates and strawberries.  Amazingly enough, they did not even seem to up-charge these things,  I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2012,11,14
233,Nice place,"We had a very nice, bright room.  Nicely decorated and the curtains were so thick they really kept the sunlight out in the morning.  Beds were very comfortable.  I absolutely recommend including the breakfast with your room.  Good food, excellent service, and a beautiful little dining room.  They were located about a 20 minute walk from downtown, but very near a train stop, so if you don't want to walk it's still easy to get downtown. The only down side of the room had to do with the bathroom.  There was no place to put toiletries so we ended up balancing them on the end of the tub.  Also no towel rack for the face towel, so that was balanced on the edge of the sink.  The shower guard didn't work very well, so every time we showered we had lots of water on the floor.  The bathroom fan (which came on with the light) was very noisy.  Especially disturbing in the middle of the night.  That being said, I would still recommend this B&B.  I did leave a comment card, and since the owner seemed to care, I wouldn't doubt if at least some of these minor problems were fixed by now.  One more thing - no one told us the car park next door was theirs also, which would have been good to know when the tiny lot in front was full.",4,2012,11,12
233,Stunning BnB-would not have stayed anywhere else,"Ariel house is a warm, friendly, spotlessly clean BnB. We were so well cared for. The breakfast is out of this world! It is a quick cab ride to Grafton Road and Temple Bar. The beds were comfortable and rooms spacious and spotless. You cannot go wrong with this BnB!",5,2012,11,11
233,"Friendly, great breakfast","We stayed 3 nights - our second visit - and found it a lovely place - friendly, unpretentious and with a great breakfast. The staff really care about looking after their guests. I requested fresh-squeezed orange juice the first morning and was provided with it specially from the kitchen. On the third morning the oranges had not been delivered with the hotel's order - so someone went out in a car to get some just for me! The rooms are partly in the Victorian? part with others in a newer wing. We prefer the older part. The rooms on both occasions have had high ceilings and ornamental cornices, good bathrooms and were well-cleaned. Some guests might complain about minor things like a slightly loose loo seat, but we loved this hotel and we will definitely stay again next time.",5,2012,11,09
233,Luxury accommodation in a beautiful location,"We had a beautiful room (The Jonathan Swift) with lovely views of leafy Lansdowne Road in classy Ballsbridge. Scrumptious breakfasts in a lovely conservatory and a self-service afternoon tea in the front room were always very appreciated. Very helpful staff and such close proximty to the DART station makes visiting Dublin city-centre a breeze. Lovely to stay in such an elite and quiet area, in such a gorgeous and historical building yet be so close to the heart of the capital. Have stayed here before this trip and won't consider staying anywhere else should we visit Dublin again. Five stars hands down - massive compliments to Deirdre and her team!",5,2012,11,05
233,Great place to stay,"We spend one night when arrived to dublin and two night before departure and were very happy with this house. From reservation on line to the end of our stay we found the management to be  very attentive and responsive  to our request.
The room was fairly small but we didnt plan to stay in all day anyway - and there is a feeling of home rather than hotel which we prefer.
Breakfast was excellent",5,2012,11,03
233,Loved it.,"Short, 5 min walk to the train. Quiet, nice street. Good restaurants in walking distance.
The staff made the hotel a place that we would stay again especially Deirdre, the hotel manager. Very helpful. Feels more like a B&B. Made accommodations for us, helped with our itinerary, arranged transportation etc. hotel is in a quiet, safe area. The Dart train is convenient for getting to the downtown area. Breakfast and service was excellent. Loved our stay. Definitely would stay here again.",4,2012,10,30
233,This is the place you want to stay in Dublin!,"We decided to stay in Ariel house for the first night of our 3-day visit to Dublin & surroundings. We had a family room in Ariel house for a very reasonable price; we selected Ariel House based on the reviews from other travellers and on the fact we needed a place to park our car.
We planned to find some B&B's for the other 2 nights, which we didn't book ahead.

After staying one night, we liked our stay so much that we decided to stay in Ariel House all three nights of our stay. What stood out (and made us stay longer) was the service, the breakfast and the lounge (with super comfy sofa/chairs and nibbles+tea galore).

We felt very welcome and comfortable; staff was very attentive but never pushy. Ariel House has won some awards (evident by the plaques and certificates near the entrance) but during our stay they really did live up to expectations!

Our room was a spacious family room, with two king beds and a bathroom, along with a seating area and small desk. The finishing of the room (and bathroom) is really fine, nothing exceptional but it's got everything you need and is clean.
The location is such that it is a 20-min walk into town (which was a great walk as we had fine weather - in the rain it would not be so great). Getting back we normally used a taxi, which were very easy to find in Dublin city centre but also around Ariel House.

We stayed as a family of four with young teenagers. We did not see any other kids during our stay but Ariel House is welcoming for older kids. Set in a historical building, you have to go up&down some stairs to get to the rooms so if you are traveling with either elderly people or prams this may be something you want to check with the staff in advance.

We would certainly recommend staying here and we will certainly book again on our next visit.",5,2012,10,29
233,Really good,"Just returned from a five night stay at Ariel House. Lovely hotel, clean room, coffee and cakes avaible in the drawing room, a breakfast to die for and a staff that's the nicest I've seen in a hotel so far. Really close to the Dart, which is very useful!",5,2012,10,27
233,Great place to stay in Dublin!,"My wife and i traveled to Dublin, along with my sister and brother in law, and all stayed at the Ariel House. We spent a total of 5 nights there. Service was awesome from the time we checked in until check out. The receptionist(s) were always very helpful and insightful when it came to recommending places to go, how to get there, etc. Rooms were very cozy and nicely organized. Our room seemed to get a little warmer than I'd have liked, but cracking a window solved that. The breakfast was amazing. Every morning there's a ""breakfast bar"" with juices, yogurt, pastries, breads, etc. On top of that, you can order from a full menu with a wide variety of starter dishes to full breakfast dishes. The porridge and herby scrambled eggs were my favorite. My wife enjoyed the salmon and poached egg very much. Everything was great. They offered cake and tea every afternoon in the drawing room, and that was definitely something that the ladies looked forward to every day. We loved ""juniors"" which was only a five minute walk from the hotel. Slattery's was a great place for a pint. The Chophouse had great food, but the service was only so-so, especially for their prices. There's also a Spar (mini grocery store) for any additional snacks right in that area.",5,2012,10,24
233,Stay at Ariel House,"We stayed at Ariel house for 3 Nights during September 2012.

The bedroom was lovely, we stayed in a Jr Suite. The room was huge. A seating area for two, flat screen tv, and a four poster bed. 
The bathroom was huge too, with shower and bath.
Room and bathroom were very clean and neat

Breakfast was delicious. Cold selection buffet. Cereal, fruit juices and the most devine breads and cheeses. The hot to order selection was excellent. I had the poached eggs with salmon and pancakes. 

They serve cake and tea/coffee every afternoon, which is a nice touch.
I also ordered the afternoon tea, and had it served in my bedroom. Excellent

Staff are friendly and very helpful
The DART is 100m from the front door
We also walked about 25min leisurely walk to get the hop on hop off bus.

Overall this place is well worth staying at. It is neat and in a quiet peaceful location.
There are also good restuarants and take aways just 5minutes walk from here and there is also a Spar also about 5 minutes walk

Highly recommended establishment",5,2012,10,23
233,Loved Ariel House!,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights on our first trip to Dublin, and we would stay here again anytime. A charming place with very comfortable rooms. The breakfasts are excellent and they have coffee, tea, and cakes laid out in the parlour all afternoon--a nice touch. The entire staff, from the front-desk people to all the young women in the breakfast room were extremely pleasant and helpful. Location was great. The airport coach lets you off less than 5 minutes' walk away; you can walk to Trinity College and the Grafton St. shops in around 20 minutes, and if you don't feel like walking, the train to take you into the city is just down the street. Good restaurants nearby such as the Chophouse and Roley's Bistro. We tried the Cuban place, Bella Cuba, and had a delicious and very reasonable meal. A starter, main course and cocktail were only 20 euro!  There are also some little delis, markets, and a post office nearby, which was convenient. Lastly, Ariel House is situated on a very quiet, tree-lined street, away from the city crowds and going to sleep at night was easy and comfortable. Highly recommend this to anyone visiting Dublin!",5,2012,10,23
233,Very nice place,"This was a very nice place to stay. Spacious rooms, perfect for repacking prior to flying out. The reception workers were very helpful. Only about 30 minutes from airport. Away from the noise of the city.",5,2012,10,22
233,Fantastic Breakfast,"Ariel House is a very cozy place to stay. They probabaly have the best breakfast in town.  The quality of everything served is superb.   We had 3 rooms during our stay, all were clean but varied in space. Many people talk about taking the dart into the city but we walked. It is a pleasureable and relatively quick half hour into the heart of Dublin.  There are several dining options three to four blocks away. Walking in the neighborhood is safe and worth it.  My only concern is if you travel with very large luggage, I did not see any elevators and we had a hard time lugging the suitcases around. Parking can be tight if you are driving a large veihicle, but it is located in the front of the hotel. I highly recommend Ariel House.",4,2012,10,21
233,Exceeded our expectations,"The staff at the Ariel House go to great lengths to make your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible.  You can read the other reviews about the breakfasts, but they also serve afternoon tea and cakes, which were welcoming after a day of touring the city.  The staff assisted us with dinner reservations, taxis, and even prepared a take-away breakfast sack when we had an early morning flight home. 
We were here for 2 nights in the James Joyce Suite.  I see another reviewer talked about the bath.  Even by US standards it's huge, and so is the room with a lovey sitting area and bay window.   Ariel won the 2012 BB award and I can see why.",5,2012,10,18
233,Consistently brilliant!,"Having stayed here on a number of occasions due to work i'm happy to say that it's never let me down. The rooms are all individually styled and the breakfasts are first class. This place oozes style and comfort. Miles better than an anonymous chain, i fully recommend this place to anyone who wants a clean, quiet place to stay in a lovely location. The trees outside my window were magnificent in their autumn colour! Look forward to returning soon!",5,2012,10,17
233,"The small, personal touches make all the difference.","We stayed in Ariel House following a bereavement in the family and would love to add our positive comments for the staff – it made a difficult time a great deal easier and we were made to feel completely at home during our time in the hotel. 

The breakfasts were superlative – beautifully presented and leagues beyond the typical eggs, bacon and sausage which are so often de rigeur, even in the most upmarket of hotel. If pancakes with fresh berry compote, poached eggs with tomato chutney and home-made potato cakes with smoked salmon sound more like what you’d rather be waking up to, Ariel house is certainly the place for you!

The rooms have everything the weary traveller needs (including tea and biscuits!) as well as lovely clean bathrooms and crisp white towels. Each is individually styled; ours had beautiful high-ceilings and a canopied four poster bed.

A real bonus is the bright and airy drawing room at the front of the house – a lovely place to relax, meet fellow travellers or to just sit quietly with the day’s paper and some complimentary tea, coffee or cake. Here too, the kitchen excels itself with its baking – everyday a new, artisan baked treat awaits you on the sideboard (our personal favourite was a blueberry cake drizzled in white chocolate). We were even asked one afternoon if we would like some of the freshly baked rhubarb tart (made with fresh rhubarb, of course!) – it was brought to us, beautifully presented and fresh from the oven with a pot of tea. 

Possibly the best part about Ariel House is the staff – caring without being overbearing or nosey, they truly offered the personal touch, going the extra mile where many others wouldn't. 

As frequent travellers, it’s often tempting to book with a familiar hotel chain for ease and convenience. Ariel  House",5,2012,10,14
233,Perfect place to stay in Dublin,"5 star luxury. We travelled across for a few days to see a show at the 02. Having stayed once before I knew it was good but it exceeded our expectations. The room was fabulous (James Joyce Suite), the bathroom was bigger than my old flat!! The staff are warm and friendly and the breakfast was brilliant. I would recommend the hotel for couples of all ages who want a bit of luxury without breaking the bank. Will go back again without hesitation. ",5,2012,10,13
233,Excellent hotel,"Ariel guest house is a small nice hotel in Dublin. The rooms Re clean with comfortable beds, welcoming personnel , but the best thing there is the breakfast. Wonderfull selection of cheese, jams , and homemade pasteries.  Every body working there is a professional. The price of the rooms per night is very cheap. Almost close to every thing. Grafton street is 20 minutes walk. I would suggest for any sort of travellers. If there again definitely it will be at Ariel.",5,2012,10,09
233,Excellent with few flaws.,"Me and my girlfriend at the time stayed here. My expectations were very high due to trip advisor. Everything was perfect about this place apart from if we looked a little more closely at things they were starting to look worn, For example the trimming on the sofa in our room was starting to come away and although this is minor there were a number of small things like this. These are the only down points to this place. Service perfect, breakfast perfect  If only they maintain this place a little better it would all be perfect. We had afternoon tea as it was thrown in with the room and it was brilliant. Salmon sandwiches, tea and cakes.  Breakfast options were good. and should cater for most tastes.",4,2012,10,08
233,Pretty hotel.,"Convinced by my wife, I didn't repent of my trip in Dublin.
Ariel hotel is very pretty and quaint. Decorated in classic style, with many elegant fabrics and fine materials. The room is spacious and well maintained, I didn't like the windows overlooking the garden which left little privacy. 
A very positive evaluation to breakfast, full of sophisticated products (great cakes).
A downside is the location because the hotel is decentralized.",4,2012,10,08
233,Great Little Place,We were looking forward to staying at Ariel House since we saw the other positive reviews and we were not disappointed. The hotel was very clean and the rooms were very quaint. The location was incredibly close to the Dart - like a 50 second walk close. The staff was very friendly and helpful and made trying to figure out where to go and how to get there a breeze.,5,2012,10,05
233,Our repeat visit didn't disappoint,"The Ariel House was just as us Aussies remembered it from our last trip overseas in 2012 to the Emerald Isle - great location, excellent breakfast, free car parking, wi fi, easy access to public transport and restaurants, quiet, pretty spacious room compared to other B&Bs, complementary tea and refreshments for the weary traveller, and a sense of old world charm. Overall we have stayed at the Ariel for seven nights and would recommend it to anyone wanting a top quality B&B in busy Dublin. It does have a lot of stairs due to its architectural style, so if you want to be closer to the ground make sure you book one of these rooms. If ever we are back in Ireland we would definitely stay again.",4,2012,10,04
233,Simply the Best,What a wonderful place to stay.  My wife and I had just been through one of our worst travel experiences ever.  It took us two days to get from New York to Dublin.  What a difference the hospitality at Ariel House made.  The staff were fantastic and could not have done anything more to make us feel so at home.  Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!  We'll be back.,5,2012,09,28
233,Really Good,"Wonderful room, great reception, easy parking, ok wifi, marvellous complimentary afternoon tea, filter coffee avail all day, kettle tea coffee in room, good heating, quiet room.
Highly recommend. Decor was very nice.
We stayed in junior suite, they carried in a proper bed for our daughter so we could sleep three. The view from window was stunning garden. The beds were all good. Bathroom was superb.",5,2012,09,26
233,Enjoyable stay,"I stayed with family for three nights in September 2012. Large, clean rooms. Free wifi. Friendly, helpful staff. They went out of their way to find a park for our over-sized rented van. Great breakfasts with fabulous, fresh scones. Nice, suburban area.  A short walk to a number of restaurants.",4,2012,09,26
233,Great Breakfast & Service,"Great place, very clean, with great service and absolutely delicious breakfast, the breads are super tasty.  The rooms are decent in size, and there's parking on premises.  It's a little far from the city centre if you're walking (25 mins or so) but great location anyway. Just 5 minute walk from a great pub called Slattery's (very friendly staff) and next to the pub is a restaurant called Juniors, where the food is absolutely delicious.",5,2012,09,25
233,Great stay,"Great hotel in a  good location near the Stadium and restaurants/bars,  A very cozy hotel with great service in a quiet area (not game-day).  Breakfast was good and the staff were phenominal.  I would highly reccomend.  A great value.  Only drawback was parking is tight.",4,2012,09,25
233,"Lovely as ever, best service in Dublin","After a mix up in rooms the first night and a not so pleasant response from me, the staff at Ariel House were super kind, caring and pleasant. Deirdre and Agla were patient and understanding. BreaKfast (and espcially the porridge & brown bread) is fantastic. They even packed us a ""to-go"" bag since we had to leave for the sirport so early. Request rooms on the upper floors....the WB Yeats suits is lovely....tea and snacks always welcoming in the sitting room...why would anyone stay anywhere else? Porter available to help with bags, etc was most helpful. It's like visiting Irish cousins.

1 Block from metro stop, tons of restaurants 2 blocks away including Roly's, Criowes' Tavern (great fries) Free parking. No air conditioning but [plenty of fans.",5,2012,09,23
233,"Can't recommend it highly enough, always my first port of call in Dublin","I have stayed in Ariel House on a number of occasions over the years, mostly when in Dublin for work.  I have never ever been disappointed and if I have to spend a night in Dublin now, my first port of call is always this beautiful guest house.  Even when given the last room they have, I feel like I am being treated to something special.  Every room I have stayed in is spacious, comfortable and warm with luxurious bathrooms.  Every room is different too, so it's always a lovely surprise to see where I end up.  Breakfast is possibly one of the best I have had in any guesthouse (and I am fussy) and the staff and management are charming and helpful.  The guesthouse gets a lot of tourists, but also caters well to business travellers and couples.  Can't recommend it highly enough.",5,2012,09,19
233,A Real Gem,Ariel house is the best. Extremely Clean and modern with updated fixtures and furniture. Very comfortable and great staff. Close to Dart(train) with easy access to Dublin. Very nice area lots of great restaurants and stores within a 5 minute walk.,5,2012,09,18
233,Great value,"The Ariel House is in a lovely, quieter area of Dublin. That means it's a little distance to shops and restaurants, but we walked and it is no more than about 15 or 20 minutes. Service was very good. The room was clean and comfortable, and had a front view. The bathroom had a blow dryer, a bath/shower, and a towel heater. The shower could have had better pressure. The breakfast may be the best feature--definitely a must-try! And home-baked pastries are set out in the drawing room (lobby) every afternoon, as well as tea and coffee. The price of 85 euros per night was an incredible deal. One drawback for some would be climbing the stairs with your suitcase--both in the front of the building and up to your room. No elevator.",4,2012,09,12
233,Beware of Garden Rooms,"We arrived in the early morning after a full house the night before. Our rooms were not ready but
2 ""garden level"" rooms had been vacated early and were offered to us once cleaned. We were told the rooms would be ready for us to look at in 15-20 minutes but it was more like an hour. After navigating a maze of stairs,corridors and doors we found the two rooms. One had a lovely
oriel window overlooking the garden-but had no window covering other than the heavy drapes so there was little privacy without totally blocking out the light. The other was a dark corner room with sheer window coverings and overdrapes! Travelling as two tired jet-lagged couples we opted for these rooms rather than wait until after 2pm for better quarters to become available. My husband and I took the corner room and were told it was totally private and only the gardener had access to the adjacent walkway and that was only on Friday. Imagine my surprise when I lay down for a short nap and looked up to see a utility workman directly outside our window. 

The room bore little resemblance to the pictures on the website with the exception of the fabrics used for bedspreads and draperies.  The wood furnishings were scratched and nicked and the upholstered furniture had stains and burns. The carpeting, as well, had seen better days. 

However, the service was quite attentive and the breakfast offered many ala carte offerings which were were prepared. The wait staff was fairly uncoordinated so requests were slow or non existent in being fulfilled.  Frankly, I think the property is shortstaffed as the same person who handled reception also served in the breakfast room, answered the phones, etc.  Too much for one person and the gaps in continuity were apparent.

The location is in a residential neighborhood but is close to the Lansdowne DART station which takes you to the City Center in 2 stops.

Caution regarding Garden level rooms as they can be noisy, dark and hidden in a rat maze of 
corridors..",3,2012,09,11
233,Amazing food,"My stay at the Ariel House was absolutely delightful. The service was friendly and warm and the receptionist did not blink and eye whilst helping me cart my over 28 kg bag up 2 flights of stairs which I was immensely grateful for so don't let the stairs put you off. The room was charming and cozy with 2 huge windows and an ensuite bathroom with bathtub and a modern shower attached. We had large single beds with a lovely view of Lansdowne Rd. But the best part of Ariel House is the food. Their afternoon tea was of the highest quality as we were served smoked salmon sandwiches, cakes as well as freshly baked scones, clotted cream and jam. Our breakfast which came with the price of the room was amazing. The first time I had heard of a two course breakfast!!!! On top of that, you had a buffet of cereal and fruit together with cakes and danishes. I had the traditional Irish breakfast which was great. My friend who is vegetarian enjoyed her selection immensely. Suffice to say I was so stuffed from breakfast that I skipped lunch. It was definitely the perfect end to my Irish experience.",4,2012,09,08
233,"Wonderful, charming find!","We chose the Ariel House due to the proximity to Aviva Stadium, but also due to the reviews on Trip Advisor.  I never book a hotel till I read Trip Advisor.  
First, let me talk about the hotel- it is a charming group of houses convertered to a hotel.  Since there are only 30 rooms, the staff and the guests have a lot of interaction.  We spent most evenings in the parlor with either a cup of tea or a glass of wine getting to know our other travelers.

The food at Ariel House is outstanding.  The breakfast is prepared by all fresh and local ingredients.  Breads from a local baker, cheeses from a local cheese makers.  You taste the quality.  The baked goods are made on site by the staff. I'd have loved to have a lesson on baking scones!  Maybe next time.  The brown bread is not to be missed!  I got the recipe!

Now onto the staff.  They are the real reason to come to the Ariel House.  Diedra leads a staff of hard working, very friendly staff.  Jessica, Jana, Eoin, and others went out of their way to fix you a cup of tea, give you directions, and make sure you were comfortable.  I was impressed that some of the other guests have been coming to Ariel House for years.

I'm not sure when we will get the opportunity to return to Ireland, but when we do, we will return to Ariel House.",5,2012,09,07
233,Failte Is Spoken Here,"I'm actually attempting to not be too effusive about this place, but it's difficult.
We actually stayed on two separate nights at Ariel House during our holiday in Ireland.
   I initially chose this B & B because of its impressive TA reviews.
  They have the best people here, starting with Deidre who is the hospitality maven.

   I was so impressed with Egle, she helped me install the Vodaphone Sim card for Ireland.
BTW, if you want to check in with the US by phone this is an inexpensive option at only 20 euros It worked flawlessly. Egle is a charming and very helpful person, but so is Jana, who was so willing to share, and has an amazing smile.
   Owen was stellar also, he left his post at the front desk to bring my heavy golf bag up the front stairs.
  
    The breakfast room employees are also very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed speaking with Ewa, and several others on the wait staff.
    The breakfast is impressive.
There's fruits and all sorts of cereals, and juices to start.
   Then they give you an extensive menu to select from. My son ordered several entrees and enjoyed them all. My nephews, who were not staying at this property were offered breakfast. The staff even prepaired a to go bag with coffee and breads.
   The cook at the Ariel House is supurb. She made some of the best scrambled eggs I've ever had.
You can linger over breakfast if you wish, they provide copies of the local newspaper.
   Ariel House has a great Tea Time from about four PM on. There are many different types of tea,
along with a selection of baked cakes and cookies.
    To work off some of the extra pounds you might acquire, Ariel House provides access to a nearby fitness club.
   My first room was very large with a queen size fourposter bed. All the furniture is antique from a period half a century ago. This ambiance transports you to that bygone era.
   They provide at least 8 bath towels, and face towels, along with enough shampoo and shower gel to last several weeks.
    Ariel house has a prime location in the most desireable suburb of Ballsbridge. The DART train is a short walk away as are several bus lines, and taxis are all around this area. Aviva Stadium is in their back yard literaly, if you're in for a match.
     This is in Dublin 4 a very quiet yet very close location.
   My only concern was the Internet service. It seemed to knock off every hour and had to be restarted.
But, we were so busy traveling in and around Dublin, this was a minor issue.
   Deirdre runs a very impressive property and I will call her upon our return to Dublin. Hopefully not everyone will check out Trip Advisor.",5,2012,09,06
233,Simply Brilliant :),"We got a last minute booking at Ariel House after securing tickets to the sold out Navy/Notre Dame Emerald Isle Classic last weekend. The city hotels were fully booked and we didn't even know how perfect this lovely B&B would actually be. The staff was fantastic. By Friday night the place was full of Americans, supporters of both teams and the atmosphere couldn't have been more friendly. The staff even arranged to help ""tailgate"" something not done at all in Ireland, but, they got into the spirit. Breakfast both mornings was fantastic. It was less than a block from the stadium & the dart. You could catch a bus on the corner & walk to everything from great pubs to a Cuban or Italian resturant. Ballsbridge is a lovely area to just walk & see the fine victorian homes, If you are driving, their secure carpark is a must.  No doubt that on our next trip to Dublin Ariel House is where we will once again stay :)",5,2012,09,04
233,Simply perfect!,"We stayed at Ariel House for 2 nights, and I wished we could have stayed longer because this place is truly wonderful. The best thing about it is the breakfast...everything is perfectly prepared,...the pancakes with bacon and maple syrup are particularly good! The rooms are nicely decorated and we had enough space for us and a cot for our baby. Deirdre was very helpful...we had a problem with our sat nav., I asked for her help and a phonecall later we were able to go to someone who could help us sort out the problem. If we had to be in Dublin again, we would not waste time looking for a place to stay, we would definitely return to Ariel House!",5,2012,08,31
233,Ariel House - lovely B&B,"I recently stayed in Ariel House on a weekend away to Dublin.  The b&b is very welcoming and in a great location next to the Dart Station (2 stops to Pearce Street).  We were greeted by a lovely lady at reception (manager/owner?), who informed us that our room was not yet ready as they were fully booked the night before, but let us wait in the tea room with some scrumptious fresh scones.  The hotel is very nice and in a convenient location that is also away from the rabble and very quiet at night.  We stayed in a ""superior twin"".  It was a lovely, extremely clean room with comfty beds and a lovely high ceiling.  The only downside would be that the room gets awfully hot at night and that there is no iron.  I read the rave reviews about the breakfast before, but it wasn't that great for an Irish breakfast.  However, the staff were very friendly and helpful.  If I were to go to Dublin again, I would definitely stay at the Ariel and highly recommend it.",3,2012,08,31
233,Had high expectations...,"We chose this place because of its high rating and low price, so arrived with very high (and perhaps unreasonable) expectations.  I'd hoped that by booking (and paying) months ahead, we wouldn't be stuck in on the ground floor, with a view of two old ladders in the back yard.  The hotel is a half block from the rail line and station, and the noise was noticeable every time the train went by.  Walls are pretty thin, but the bathroom had been recently remodeled and the room itself was nice.  Staff were very helpful and accommodating.  Breakfast was excellent and not overpriced at 11 euros.  Considering the low price (~$80/night), this was an great deal!  Checking out the current posted rate, it looks like I got lucky by booking ahead...",4,2012,08,29
233,Special Magical Stay with Gracious Welcoming Hosts,"Ariel House is just gorgeous - a wonderful respite from the busy-ness of Dublin, yet within minutes from the centre of the city. Old world charm, yet thoroughly modern, spotlessly clean, welcoming, friendly, open and generous. Great beds - fabulous bath - wonderful Irish handmade soaps - handmade cookies and tea and coffee and hot chocolate. Breakfast is just out of this world spectacular. SO delicious. Go hungry!!! And afternoon high tea is just as wonderful. All in all, we had a wonderful time. I will make Ariel House my home base in Dublin from now on - I wouldnt want to stay anywhere else. It has the ease, comfort and convenience of a hotel, with the personality and graciousness of a family run establishment. They cannot do enough to make your stay wonderful - and they succeed over and over again.",5,2012,08,28
233,Amazing little gem just minutes outside of the city center,"Spectacular is the first word that comes to mind. My room was spacious and quiet, allowing me to enjoy three peaceful nights rest. The morning breakfast was good, and the friendly service from Egle, Adnan, and Fahmay, the three young people who managed the front desk, made the experience very positive. The property was the most memorable out of the three hotels I stayed in when visiting Ireland August 2012.",5,2012,08,27
233,Perfect Dublin Experience!,"What sweet memories we have of Ariel House!  By far the best breakfast on our whole trip of Ireland.  The fresh fruit brochettes were awesome!  Excellent coffee and gourmet cheeses, breads, pastries in addition to the porridge, eggs and meats available.  (We all loved the pancakes with fresh berries!)  The breakfast is only rivaled by the quality of the staff.  They are incredibly friendly and helpful, really making the guest feel comfortable and cared for.  There is someone at the desk at all hours to help also.  We arrived late our first night and they helped us figure out how to get dinner at that odd hour.  The front desk staff summoned taxis for us, helped with tours and even find a place to get a haircut.  We loved coming in at the end of a long day and enjoying a cup of tea and those yummy cakes in the lobby.  My teenagers would eat the whole platter and more little cakes would just arrive magically!  Our family room was very nice and spacious with lots of windows and a generous bathroom. We loved the towel warmers that came on in the morning!   Very nice location in a quiet neighborhood southeast of the city center, but with great restaurants and pubs within walking distance and public transport only a few blocks away.  We bookended our trip with a stay at the Ariel House and it was like coming home that last night.  Another round of tea and cakes and we were sad to say goodbye to the Ariel House!  Very highly recommended!",5,2012,08,25
233,Great Place!,Our two night in August 2012 was made very enjoyable by friendly and helpful staff. The hotel breakfasts are substantial and the location is ideal for the city centre - 3 stops on the DART. I thoroughly recommend this hotel.,5,2012,08,24
233,Words Fail Me!,"The Ariel House is a real find. My Mum and I stayed here last week while at the Horse Show and they could not have looked after us better. They were helpful before our arrival, gave us a fab room, the breakfasts were to die for and they just couldn't do enough for us. They really made our stay in Dublin a joy....and we shall return for more of the Ariel treatment. Thanks.",5,2012,08,23
233,Excellent find in expensive city,"Enjoyed a 4-night stay at Ariel House just last week, the end of a 17-day trip to Ireland. Not elegant, but affordable. . . and we really liked it.  It's a lovely old Georgian row house.  It is not in the city center, but is 1/2 block from the Dart (train) station and 2 stops into the very heart of Dublin.  Certainly worth it for the price.  The parking is ample and free, the staff is very pleasant, and the breakfasts are much above average.  We ate at 3 nearby restaurants which we would heartily recommend: The French Paradox (wine store downstairs, bistro upstairs), Chophouse (very good gastro pub rec. by Anthony Bourdain), and Tom O'Connell's (brother of Darina Allen of Ballymaloe fame) . . .all within walking distance.  The Ariel house had tea, coffee, water, cakes, breads, cookies available at all times . . . included . . . and bottles of wine for sale.  Free WiFi.  We had a larger room on the 2nd floor of main house facing the street and it was very comfortable . . . lots of room and a king bed. . . Room 222.  Only one  negative:  water pressure in shower is very low.  You will not be disappoined here and you might even be glad you missed out on the noise and the prices in city center.",4,2012,08,23
233,Excellent,"The area is very relaxing, elegant, quite posh, residential, connected to the center. The near surroundings are surprisingly quiet and calm. The building is an upper class old victorian house - rooms are pretty spacious and high-ceilinged, the wooden floor is a bit squeaky. 
I spent 4 nights at Ariel House, in two separate times. The room at the lower level was very clean, quiet, a bit too dark. The room in the main building was large, well lit. Breakfast has been constantly good. The staff was particularly helpful and professional, very hotel-like. 
The price was a huge, positive surprise.
Minor points: the toilet in one of the rooms was a bit damaged / one of the receptionist is really attractive. This is for the 25-34 / the B&B is really close to the AVIVA stadium",5,2012,08,21
233,Hidden Jem,We stayed at the Ariel House on both ends of our Ireland adventure. The Ariel House was the perfect spot to get acquainted with city and perfect place to get ready for the trip home. The rooms were large and the breakfast is stunning. The staff is always there to help and arrange tours and taxis for you. With our large family and different ages it was a place that everyone is looking to return to soon!!!,5,2012,08,21
233,Fab time in Dublin,"We stayed in a basement family room and thoroughly enjoyed our stay, we wished it could have been longer.  The room was comfortable and although it was slightly dark due to lack of ceiling lights, the lamps gave it a lovely relaxing atmosphere.  There was plenty of room, beds were comfortable and the bathroom was spacious.  We certainly didnt experience any noise from rooms above.  In fact it was very quiet for a city.

The breakfast was excellent with a great choice.  You could choose from the buffet and also from a cooked menu.  We had the cooked Irish Breakfast and one of us had pancakes.  We also had toast, scones, fruit, cereals and juices.  Our last day was an early start and they provided breakfast for us to take with us which had fruit, banana bread, bread, butter and scones. Freshly baked cakes and biscuits were also provided in the afternoon.

The location is great too, peaceful but close to the train or you could even walk to the city centre.

The staff were always helpful, the building is lovely and has a very welcoming atmosphere.  We wouldn't hesitate to go back.",5,2012,08,20
233,"Nice hotel , great location for RDS","Stayed in April. When we arrived our room wasn't ready because we were too early , but we were served complimentary coffee and fresh scones/homemades breads while we waited in the beautiful drawing room . Our room at the back was very quiet. The breakfast is particulaly good. Its a great location for the RDS and still convenient for the city centre as the dart is so close. There are several restaurants nearby .We ate in the hotel opposite at night.Would recommend it.",5,2012,08,16
233,First Class place to stay,"This is a fantastic place to stay. They do wonderful breakfasts (it is worth staying here for the breakfast alone). The rooms are spacious and comfortable. They have a large lounge with free newspapers and a large television; in the evening there are plentiful scones with jam and butter. The location is unsurpassed; it is right next door to Lansdowne Road stadium (now Aviva Stadium though I hate calling it that) and the RDS, and a short bus trip (or a pleasant tree lined 30 minute walk) into city centre. You couldn't ask for anything more. Deirdre is wonderful; you feel just like you are at home, except the breakfast is way better than at home!",5,2012,08,16
233,Comfortable accommodations and phenomenal service,"As far as accommodations go, Ariel House is comfortable, clean, in a great location and has a delicious breakfast, but it is in need of some TLC.  The staff, however, is what makes this 4 stars rather than 3.  They were out of this world!

We had been traveling for seven weeks with three children.  Needless to say, we had a ton of luggage.  Ariel House stored half our luggage for us for nearly a week prior to our stay.  Upon our arrival, they were not able to provide us with a camp bed for our third child, so they offered us a second room down the hall for no charge.  While it wasn't ideal, it worked out nicely.  Deirdre and the rest of the staff bent over backwards to make sure our children were happy and we were enjoying our stay.

As for the guest house itself, it's just that--a guest house.  That said, one can not go in with the expectations that this will rival the Merrion Hotel.  Rooms were clean and beds were fine.  I can't say I slept great as the evenings were warm and airflow was minimal.  Also, I would highly recommend Ariel to invest in some down pillows.  The pillows on the bed were pretty awful.  Our shower was broken too, but we aren't complete hotel snobs...when the kids are happy, we are too.  Definitely great for families and would return with the family, though if we were traveling as a couple, I have to say I would splurge for the Merrion.",4,2012,08,16
233,"Great atmosphere, service, room and location","We stayed here for 10 days and it was an excellent choice for us.  It is close to the lansdowne rd DART station,  but not so close to be bothered by the noise.  We had a very large room on the basement level overlooking the garden in the back. It was great for our toddler.  They even got us a crib.  Our room was right under the breakfast room, but it was pretty well soundproofed, so all you'd hear was muffled footsteps, if that.  Breakfast was amazing (we paid to have it included with our room).  The atmosphere was elegant, yet welcoming.  The standout had to be the service.  Top notch.  Whatever we needed, they looked after us, whether it was putting our toddlers food in their fridge, highchair at breakfast, a couple loads of laundry.  A nice home away from home.  There is also a couple stores nearby, plus Herbert park, which our toddler loved.  WiFi was free.  Price was very reasonable given all we got.  we would stay here again for sure.",5,2012,08,11
233,"""Delightful accomadation with many extras""","Thank you to Deirdre and all the amazing staff at Ariel House for making our stay so enjoyable and relaxing. We stayed here  two different times with our teenage kids during our Irish vacation in July. Ariel house is one of those 'gems' that you rarely find anymore when travelling. As soon as you check in, your every need is taken care of, from complimentary delecious home made treats to relaxing in the drawing room filled with fresh flowers.
Our exausted kids were trilled that breakfast was served till noon after Bruce Springsteens concert. The breakfast menu is outstanding my favorite being, poached eggs with irish smoked salmon and scones with locally made rasberry jam. Loved that they have a selection of screw top wines at very reasonable prices. Look forward to returning sometime soon and in the meantime I will try some of your delecious recipies...",5,2012,08,10
233,First stay in Ariel House!,"This was our first stay in Ariel House, having walked past it many times on our way to rugby matches.  It was absolutely fabulous and very luxurious.  On our arrival we found the complementary afternoon tea and delicious blueberry cake a real treat.  Breakfast was first class.  Nothing in Ariel House disappointed us and we will definitely look for nowhere else to stay in Dublin from now on!",5,2012,08,09
233,Beautiful rooms at fabulous rates,"While looking for a decent hotel at at affordable rate online, we found this gem. We ""splurged"" on a superior room that had breakfast included in the daily rate. The room was an absolute delight after a long travel day. It was spacious, well maintained, and beautiful. We faced the street, but didn't have a single problem with noise from the traffic (it seems like the area is pretty quiet). We had breakfast twice, and both times the hotel did a splendid job. There was a wonderful continental style spread, and a large menu from which to order your hot items. 

The hotel is just outside the city centre, in what seems like a nice, upscale neighbourhood. The train just down the street easily takes you to the heart of Dublin.",5,2012,08,05
233,what a lovely hotel,"Stayed here for one night while i was in dublin to see my queen madonna and this hotel is lovely, just a minute walk to the aviva staduim lovely rooms and the bed was so comfortable, staff were very pleasant and helpful breakfast was great, if your staying in dublin this is the place to stay also not far from city centre.",5,2012,08,04
233,Excellent Hotel near Aviva Stadium Dublin,"We stayed in a superior room for one night to attend a concert at the Aviva. Superb location to the Avivia Stadium, with car parking for residents The hotel rooms were furnished to a high standard, and spotlessly clean, and staff very polite and helpful. Would recommend paying the extra for a Superior Room. The Breakfast was good.  Would definetly stay again if attending an event at the Aviva Stadium.",5,2012,07,29
233,Highly recommend staying here,"The reason for this review is to put any doubts for booking this property out of your mind.  
I returned yesterday after staying with my friend as we were attending the Madonnas concert in the Aviva Stadium. 
Firstly - the area : beautiful, in a quiet part of Dublin - that's a treat when you want a decent sleep!
Exterior as you walk up to the steps - beautiful period building. 
Staff - extremely helpful and very pleasant, we had booked a twin room via Expedia on a room only rate, but the man at reception upgraded us to a complimentary breakfast. 
At the moment I'm awaiting a back operation next month and didn't think I would make it to the concert, but I was delighted to find the concert venue literally a 5min walk from the property. 
Our room was downstairs - this was one of my issues - firstly for the size of the building, no lifts!
Secondly, we were in a downstairs room that was extremely warm and unfortunately we couldn't open out the large window as it was alarmed and we thought it wise to keep it shut. I understand that to install air conditioning throughout the building is an enormous expense - but even if they put a roof fan?
After the concert we returned to the B&B and were greeted by the staff who yet again couldn't do enough to help. My friend was very hungry and we asked if it would be possible to order in a takeaway - not only did they help us with phone numbers but phoned the pizza company for us and placed the order, phoning us in our room to let us know when it arrived. 
After the pizza, we had a great nights sleep in comfortable beds and woke up the next day to a hearty breakfast with a good choice of Irish or continental dishes.
Will definitely return to this property. 
Will recommend it to any of my close friends and family. 
Loved it! 
To the staff : thank you for being so helpful - its greatly appreciated!",5,2012,07,26
233,"Absolutely fabulous, first class B&B, great location, service and food second to none!",Booked Ariel House based on location to Aviva stadium for the Madonna concert. What a gem. I have stayed in 4-5 star hotels and the food and service have not been a patch on what we received here at Ariel House. i was in two minds whether to review or not as I want to keep this little find to myself! But it's too good not to share. The staff were extremely attentive and the breakfast was exceptional. We enquiried  about family rooms for a future visit and Deidre and Owen couldn't have been more helpful. They showed us a room and gave us a room number to ask for on our next visit with the kids. What a fantastic establishment and I look forward to staying here again the next time I am in Dublin. ,4,2012,07,26
233,It was the best of times at the Aerial Hotel,"This was a return trip to the Aerial Hotel & it was even better this time. Perfect location at Ballsbridge walking distance to the RDS. Leafy and very safe area to stay, Dart train a short walk away. Very warm welcome from reception, efficient and friendly. Room was a mix of old world ambiance with modern touches it ticked all the boxes. The breakfast is something very special, many 5 star Hotels could learn a lot from the Aerial Hotel. Once again the staff were a credit to the hotel, I really looked forward to  the wonderful breakfast each morning. We stayed for 3 nights, Springsteen at the RDS, Dublin rocked for two nights. We were so busy we never got to try the complementary coffee and cakes, look forward to that treat next time.",5,2012,07,26
233,Concert RDS,We spent one night here last week to go to the RDS it was very close only 5 min walk away. the staff were very friendly and the room was a good size for 4 adults and the breakfasts was brilliant with a fabulous selection i will definitely stay here again and recommend ariel house to everyone.,5,2012,07,23
233,Nice Dublin B&B,"First of all this is a very friendly B&B with lovely staff and a very good breakfast in a super location for the rugby and the RDS arena. However the furniture is looking rather tired and the water pressure in the bathroom could do with a boost. Also the pillows are very hard.

They provide  a very nice complementary afternoon coffee and cakes in the lounge and everything is nice and clean.",3,2012,07,22
233,Fabulous little hotel,"Very picturesque building and interior design! Very helpful staff. Room (the one, named ""Oscar Wilde"") is very spacious and has a large window to the pretty garden. The furniture is genuine XIX century style. A little shabby but very stylish. The nice bathroom with large tub and shower stall. Very nice trip to history.",5,2012,07,22
233,Good choice,"We just spent 3 nights at the Ariel House premises.
We had  such a lovely stay.
The guesthouse is very good, nice staff. The breakfast is super with a fab menu.
We stayed in the lower floor rooms ... The are a bit under tone in comparison with the rest of the house, but the complimentary wi-fi, coffee & cakes and parking made everything perfect.
The location is good ... 3 minutes from the DART and, if someone feels like waking, 30 minutes walking from downtown ... My 71 mother in law did it!
I definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2012,07,21
233,Good Location,"My husband and stayed here recently. Ideal location for the RDS (where the Boss was playing).

We had a room in the lower part of the hotel. We booked a standard room. i had read all the reviews about the hotel and i was slightly disappointed. The room was a good size but the furniture is starting to get a bit haggered looking. the bathroom was very narrow. the bath and shoes were all one and the water tended to spill out in the floor. The toilet was just off this and you nearly had to back into it, it was so narrow. A bit of damp was starting to go up the walls in the toilet.

While it was nice and quiet you could hear the guests in the room above walking on the floorboards.

The breakfast was out on and the quality was excellent. The staff were very nice and helpful so we did enjoy it and yeah we probably stay here again. its an ideal base for doing a bit if sight seeing for concerts or for football games in the aviva stadium.",4,2012,07,20
233,Fantastic customer service,We stayed for three nights at Ariel House. The rooms are large and clean. The breakfasts are great. The staff go out of their way to be helpful. The complimentary scones and cakes in the afternoon are a really treat. The free parking is a bonus. We would really recommend this hotel.,5,2012,07,19
233,Amazing Guest House,"We stayed at Ariel House and had a brilliant time, the staff were so helpful and friendly without being over powering.
The breakfast was to die for, good quality and such a choice.
Every day they had complimentary tea, coffee, cakes and biscuits in the drawing room such a lovely touch.
Would certainly go back.",5,2012,07,19
233,Great experience,We booked this hotel by reading positive reviews on tripadvisor and we weren't disappointed. What a lovely hotel. I must recommend this hotel to everyone!,5,2012,07,16
233,Best hotel breakfast ever!,"Having stayed twice in this hotel this year, I was very impressed with the wonderful selection of fresh baked breads, good quality pastries and cheeses and the quality of the cooked breakfast - so much so that any small complaints that I would have about the poor lighting in the bedroom could most definitely be overlooked.  The service in the hotel was very good, and the complimentary coffees and cakes in the lobby are a nice touch.",4,2012,07,16
233,You won't be disappointed. It's first rate.,"My husband and I booked Ariel House after reading positive reviews. We weren't disappointed. We just ended a four day visit and couldn't be happier with accommodations. Upon arriving jet lagged at 8:30 am the staff immediately offered breakfast and a place to stow our luggage. Stayed in the Oscar Wilde suite which was spacious and had a delightful garden view. The front desk staff was helpful and attentive. Breakfast in the sunny dining room gave each day a positive start. All the food was delicious and the wait staff friendly. While it is located out of the city center in the Ballsbridge area, it's an easy 10 minute ride on the #7 bus to city center. Walking to St Stephen's Green takes about 30 min...but it's a lovely walk.",5,2012,07,15
233,Gorgeous House & Amazing Staff,"The Ariel House is a gorgeous ""Georgian Style"" B&B/Hotel located right off of Lansdowne Road.  The location is just east of the City Center of Dublin, but is a very short walk to the DART station (200 yards at most).  We stayed for two nights over the first of July and we could not have enjoyed ourselves more.

My wife and I, along with six other members of my family (all adults) all stayed at the Ariel House.  To say that they made our accommodations perfect, is almost an understatement.  From our arrival to check out, the management and staff all made sure that we were all looked out for.  I will say, that I also felt they paid equal amount of attention to all of the other guests at the hotel as well.

The Ariel House is probably more of a B&B, but has a bit of a boutique hotel feel, which is very nice.  Our three rooms were on the first floor (ground level) and had nice views of the gardens.  The rooms were very large, and the bathrooms provided everything you would need and expect in a top end hotel.

Our entire party arrived on the overnight flight, and while check-in was not until around 1 pm, they were more than happy to store our luggage and allow us to eat breakfast in their dining room.  The dining room is a beautiful solarium in the back that probably could seat up to 20 guests.  The food was excellent (the brown bread was amazing!).

Throughout the day and during tea time they would have coffee/tea/water along with bread/biscuits/etc in their drawing room.  It was always nice to come back to after being out, and the room is well appointed with seating and reading material.

The location of the Ariel House is great for the DART station, although maybe a bit too far for walking to the Dublin City Center.  In the ""Embassy"" region, the area has many tree lined roads and is very quiet. We found this to be quite nice though as it provided a bit of an escape from the activity of Dublin.  Within walking distance were a few nice pubs and restaurants (perhaps 1/4 mile?)  that we ended up going to during our stay.  

Overall, we could not say enough about how great the Ariel House nor its staff and management were.  All of our expectations were exceeded and we would definitely stay there again when in Dublin.",5,2012,07,10
233,Luxurious bathrobes and stunning breakfasts!,"My partner and I have stayed here three times in the past year. The last time we walked up those steps, it felt like we were coming home, and we received such a warm welcome. The staff are wonderful; they go out of their way to help, and make you feel well looked after.

As others have said, the breakfasts are stunning. We had to leave early to catch a ferry but that didn't mean having to miss out! Deirdre prepared a take-away for us: yoghurt, fresh fruit, homemade granola, bread and cakes, and tasty cheese. Nom! Nom! Nom! :) By the way, you can find recipes on the Facebook page. Definitely worth a 'Like'!

The place is immaculate; the bathroom chrome gleams. The toiletries come from The Handmade Soap Company; all made in Ireland (and you can buy the whole range in the Kilkenny Design Centre in Nassau Street, Dublin). The bathrobes are not the usual one-size-fits-nobody towelling things you find in most hotels, but BIG luxurious fleece robes that you can really wrap around you (and I loved having those slippers to wear for breakfast).

Our room (255) was at the front, and surprisingly quiet. No problem getting a good night's sleep here. The bed is a proper super-king (not a zip-link) and very comfortable, with gorgeous linens. 

Perfect! Simply perfect! Looking forward to staying again.",5,2012,07,10
233,Good Hotel and Service,"We stayed at this hotel on 23 and 24 June at the start of our two week drive around Ireland.  Very easy to find from Dublin Port.  The Aviva Stadium is practically next door and the Dart railway into the centre of Dublin is a 30 second walk away.  We had a superior room which was very spacious, a queensized bed together with a seating area.  Breakfast was good and their raspberry jam to die for!!  One little niggle though, when we left one morning at 9.30am we put the sign on the door to make up the room, on returning at 3.30pm when my husband didn't feel well, our room had not been serviced at all.  I phoned reception who then sent someone up to do it, which wasn't convenient as my husband was sleeping, consequently we had no fresh coffee cups, towels or tea/coffee, which I had to ask for.  But apart from that I would recommend it.",4,2012,07,10
233,Noce place to stay,Very nice hotel. Centrally located. The wireless Internet worked well in all of our rooms. We stayed one night before our flight out and it was an easy 15 minute drive in the morning. Since we left before breakfast was served they put together some croissants and breads for us to eat for later. We wish we had more time to spend there.,4,2012,07,07
233,Wonderful part of our Family Trip To Ireland,"While planning our family trip to Ireland with our daughters aged 13 and 10 (which included brief stops in London and Paris) we discovered that unlike the States it is not easy to find accomodations for a family of four. During my search I came acorss the Ariel House and all the wonderful reviews, in particular as a place for a family of four. It did not disappoint. A previous reviewer suggested an upper room would be quiter. Upon arrival we discovered that the room did not typically sleep four but beds were moved in to accomodate our family. There was plenty of room and it was a very enjoyable stay. The breakfast was delicous. The staff was very accomodating including helping us with reservations at a local restaurant on a Saturday night, and suggesting the best way to see the city. We enjoyed some quite family time in the front room  complete with refreshments. We would absolutley stay there again.",5,2012,07,06
233,"Quaint, Friendly, Affordable!!",The staff is very friendly and helpful and the free breakfast is amazing. They let us check in early and check out late with no trouble and the room was very clean. I would highly reccommend anyone going to Dublin to stay there.,5,2012,07,05
233,"Elegant, antique, affordable, convenient to Dart","A hushed, elegant, soft-carpeted air in the large piano/sitting room, decorated with period furniture. The ever-present coffee, tea, and cakes were welcome when we arrived 'home' between excursions to town or the neighborhood. Kudos to the lovely desk managers, who were so patient and helpful, with recommendations, directions, assist with phone calls for rental car, etc. Our rooms were modern in their size, big, comfortable beds, dark wood furnishings. Very clean. Bathrooms modern. Breakfast in the sunroom was first class! I loved the poached eggs (fluffy like a meringue) and smoked salmon, with brown bread on the side. Sideboard with fruits, compotes, fresh yogurt, and cereals. Service was excellent. Felt pampered, hich was nice our first leg of the trip, when we were jet lagged.",5,2012,07,03
233,Best Accommodation Ever,"What makes this inn exceptional is the staff, who bend over backwards every which way to make us happy. For example, we are travelling through Great Britain for several weeks and didn't want to waste half a day doing laundry, so we asked reception if we could pay them to do a load of laundry. They told us that it would be immediately and ready in a few hours, and they absolutely refused my offer to pay them. I've travelled to hundreds of hotels, guest houses and B & Bs, and made this request: no one refused to take cash. The staff at Ariel House are too good to be true.

Furthermore, the breakfasts are exquisite. The egg dishes are beautifully prepared with fresh vegetables and home made breads. There is plenty of fruit and yoghurt and delicious oatmeal or pancakes. The rooms are far more spacious than I normally find in Great Britain or Europe in my moderate price range. The mattress is comfortable, the room is very clean, and it's nicely furnished. The bedding is lovely.

This inn is a special find. I highly recommend a stay at Ariel House.",5,2012,06,27
233,Stay here!!,"Just home from a fabulous stay in Ariel House!! Rooms clean, tidy and very comfortable. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Fantastic choices at breakfast. They have afternoon tea which was a big hit was me and my friends. Unlimited tea/coffee homemade biscuits and cakes for FREE!!! A stones throw from the Lansdowne Dart and Aviva. Free Wifi. Will certainly be back again!",5,2012,06,25
233,Wonderful Place,"We stumbled into Ariel House after a very long transatlantic flight, just exhausted and probably not very coherent.  The staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. They stored our luggage and recommended a great place for breakfast within walking distance, and were consistently charming and helpful during our 2 day stay.  Our room was very nice, afternoon tea in the sitting room was a lovely surprise - tea, water with lemon, and various tasty cookies and cake.  Just be aware there isn't a lift, and the hotel entrance is up a flight of concrete steps, but staff was  available to assist. The Aviva Stadium is very close by, so I don't know what things might be like on game days.   The DART station is very close, and the hop-on/hop-off is about a mile away, with a walk past Merion Square. The neighborhood is quiet and pretty.  We loved the place and it was a lovely introduction to Ireland.  We would stay here again any chance we get.",5,2012,06,25
233,A very special family vacation,"My husband, daughter and I stayed at the Ariel House for 5 wonderful days earlier this month.  The staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly.  They even did some laundry for us.  The charge was cheaper than the local laundromatte.  The breakfasts were delicious and bountiful.  Because our college-aged daughter was traveling with us, they let her eat free!.  It was a great place to relax after exploring downtown Dublin, which was in walking distance.  We would choose the Ariel House again.",5,2012,06,22
233,Good choice,"Staff was very friendly; anyway during our stay in Ireland we were surprised by the extreme friendliness of the Irish people. Breakfast was great, as we expected after reading all the reviews. Our room was nice (we slept with open window, very quiet), but the bed was a bit narrow.
The hotel is located close to different bus stops (also the stop for the Air Coach) and the Dart train (check the timetable on Sunday).
Wifi was free and good.",5,2012,06,19
233,A gem,"Ariel House is a real delight.  Tea or coffee available in the lounge free at any time complete with tasty cakes and biscuits. A quiet residential location with a comfortable bed.  Friendly highly professional staff, free parking on site and close to the city centre by car. Plus a fabulous breakfast cooked to order in a garden room setting.  What is not to love!",5,2012,06,17
233,Great Dublin B&B,"I spent three nights at this B&B and have only great things to say about it. My room was cozy and full of character, the bed was very comfortable, the complimentary afternoon tea in the drawing room was very nice, and the breakfast was sensational. The place is exceptionally clean and the decor is lovely. The staff are fabulous and go out of their way to help you, suggesting walking tours, recommending restaurants, booking travel, and generally maintaining great spirits. The Ariel House breakfast is famous, and deservedly so, so make sure you enjoy their breakfast at least once during your stay and be prepared to wait a short time for a table. If you like boutique hotels with charm and good service this B&B is the place for you. ",5,2012,06,17
233,great location & nice rooms,"We stayed in the boutique hotel for 3 nights while in Dublin (2 at the beginning/1 at the end). Our rooms were very clean and well decorated.  The room at the end of the trip was much more spacious than the one at the beginning, for the same price. The staff explained that since the better room was unoccupied they put us in there. I was really impressed with that since I've never stayed in a hotel that gives you a little extra when they can. The first room was also a nice room, just less room for moving around. Also, I love to have a good soak after touring around all day and this place had really nice, clean tubs.

The best part about this hotel was that it was so close to the DART station, and easy to get to and from Connolly Station and the airport. My husband and I arrived in Dublin from the US and took the Airlink Express bus (you can get tickets at the airport, no need to buy in advance). The AE took us to Connolly Station (the stop is actually between connolly and bus aras) where we got tickets for the DART to the Landsdowne Road stop. The hotel is in a nice-looking neighborhood about a half block from the station. 

We also went on a Mary Gibbons tour to Newgrange and Tara ($35pp) and the pick up for us was very close by Ariel House (about a block away).

As comparison, we spent one night at Roxford Lodge around the corner. Although it is also very nice, we felt that Ariel was a better value for the money, especially given that it was so close to the DART station.",5,2012,06,13
233,Gorgeous B&B that met all our needs...,"Travelling for a week through Ireland with six other members of my family, it was initially quite tricky to find some accommodation that would not be overly expensive for us. We came across Ariel House and right from the start, we were impressed with our accommodation. Beautiful structure and layout and a tea room as soon as you walk in the door where you could sit in comfy armchairs, have access to complimentary tea and cake, as well as read a book by Oscar Wilde. Further, they provided us with the rooms on the bottom floor so we could all be together, assisted us with all our transport needs and the breakfast every day was delicious and well presented!",5,2012,06,12
233,Dublin at its best,"I travel to Dublin regularily and am always disappointed with the hotels I have stayed in, until now. 
Ariel House is charming, clean, with superb friendly service and the best breakfast I have ever had in Ireland.  I am gluten free and also like low fat milk (very hard to find in Irish hotels) and I feasted on Ariel's home baked gluten free banana bread, gluten free muesli and fresh fruit, eggs and smoked salmon, with other choices available.  A large jug of low fat milk was brought to my table and replenished when needed.

What I also like is that it is located in a quiet suburb, away from the hustle and noise of the likes of Temple Bar, so for those sad people like me who don't stay up all night clubbing, it is ideal.

The room, in the basement, was enormous and very comfortable.  The bathroom was also huge and featured a large bathtub as well as a shower.

A late check out was no problem and I was able to relax in the drawing room drinking coffee and reading the newspaper until the taxi arrived.

Other pluses include free wi-fi and free parking.",5,2012,06,11
233,Great B&B in Dublin,We loved our stay at the Ariel House in Dublin.  We were upgraded for free to an awesome room when the staff found out we were on our honeymoon.  Food was great and the location was close to public transportation which made it easy to get around the city.  We will definitely be staying there again on our next trip to Dublin!,5,2012,06,10
233,"Over-hyped, and in serious need of modernisation ...","We stayed for one night in early June, and that was enough!  We chose to stay here based upon reviews on this website.  I can honestly say that people must be very easily pleased to rate this place so highly.

First, the positives: The breakfast was decent, with good choice.  However, it’s poor form when there are more guest rooms than tables at a place this size, resulting in customers standing and waiting for tables to become free before they can eat.  The availability of coffee and cake/biscuits in the guest’s lounge during the afternoon and evening was a nice touch, and the place is kept clean.

Now for the (many) negatives: We booked a “superior double” room, and ended up what can only be described as a cramped twin, with the beds jammed up against walls.  The hotel’s website describes superior double rooms as, “tastefully appointed and elegant.”  Trust me, they aren’t, and the room we stayed in looks nothing like the images portrayed on the website!  Next there’s the en-suite bathroom, which is small and poorly ventilated, and next to useless because the water pressure is so low that the taps run slow and the shower dribbles water … it’s more like being in a light rain shower than a refreshing power shower.  We requested a quiet room when we booked, but we were placed next to the main staircase and above the breakfast room, neither of which were quiet.  The location of the Lansdowne Road DART Station about 100 metres away from the bedroom window didn’t help either, with regular trains and customer tannoy announcements making sleep impossible during busy commuter periods.  Worst of all though was the heat in the room … the weather was very humid and sticky while we were in Dublin, but we couldn’t get any through draught into the room because the window is limited to open by no more than about two inches.  Safety is one thing, but this is ridiculous …

Overall, this was a VERY disappointing experience, and I strongly advise people to consider spending a few Euros more to stay in a more modern hotel, where the rooms are well ventilated and the facilities in the en-suite bathroom fit for purpose.",2,2012,06,10
233,Nice hotel in Dublin,"Stayed here at the end of our Ireland trip.  It is a beautiful small hotel in Dublin.  The room was very comfortable, nice bathroom, plenty of room.  Breakfast was good.  Service was very friendly.  It seemed more ""Americanized"" than other places we stayed in which is good and bad, a little less charm than some but very comfortable.  It's a pretty good walk into town is the only real drawback.  Would stay here again.",5,2012,06,08
233,Wonderful Break,"On arrival we were offered breakfast while our rooms were being prepared which was a lovely bonus as it was 10.30. The breakfast was a nice surprise. A selection of cereals, breads and cakes, along with a selection of hot food.  all fresh and nicely presented, the only down is that there is not enough tables for all guest and a couple of times during our stay we had to wait which isn't always suitable if you are booked on a set time tour.

The rooms were spacious and clean the beds were comfy and I had a lovely nights sleep.  Some of the furniture looked a little tired.  Bathrooms were modern and always hot water when needed.

The sitting room was wonderul and the complimentary tea and cakes in the afternoon was most welcome after a long walk around Dublin.

the Hotel is about 25 minute walk from Dublin Centre but the Dart railway is a 2 minute walk.

All in all we had a lovely break and would certainly return to Ariel House if visiting Dublin again.",4,2012,06,08
233,PAT S,"We really enjoyed staying here recently .  We arrived in Dublin early in am and were allowed to go to our room to catch a nap before going out on town.  Our room was very clean and the staff so friendly and helpful. The next day, we enjoyed a delicious breakfast with anything one could ask for. On our departure, we were helped with our bags and even given some scones for our trip on train.  If I were to return to Dublin, this is where I would go straight away.",5,2012,06,06
233,Charming!,Really enjoyed our stay at Ariel House. This was our first visit ti Dublin. the room was lovely. very comfortable bed and charming decor. The staff were so helpful and the breakfast s were great.  They even had coffee for us when we had to leave for the airport before any normal people would be awake! great first impression of Dublin!,5,2012,06,03
233,Wonderful hotel,"This is the third time I have stayed at Ariel House. It is such a lovely hotel, very friendly staff and very comfortable room. The breakfast was, as always, wonderful - so much choice. The location of the hotel is also excellent with the DART train so close by which can take you into the city centre or lovely excursions up and down the coast. I cannot wait until I can come back to Dublin and stay at Ariel House, it is like coming home.",5,2012,06,02
233,Comfortable hotel in quiet location,"Lovely, comfortable hotel in the suburbs, but easily accessible to city centre. All  the staff were very friendly & helpful. Great  breakfast menu.  Had requested a quiet room-which is exactly what we got-room 238-with a lovely view overlooking the garden.  Cannot praise this hotel  enough-hopefully will get chance  to  return one day.",5,2012,05,28
233,Wonderful B&B,"We stayed here on the 6th May 2012 and from the moment I walked in the door I was impressed.
I booked a deluxe double room for 89 euro, which for ballsbridge is great value so I wasnt sure what to expect, I had no idea it had won an award til I saw the plaque on the entrance wall.Lovely old building, parking onsite for free.
Tha staff was very friendly. In the drawing room there is coffee ready, you can ask for tea and also gorgeous freshly baked, scones, biscuits and other cakes- this was a lovely touch.
The room was very large with four large sash windows looking out of the front of the building.comfortable bed and a spacious room.
Landsdowne rd dart less than 5 min walk.great location.
Also Had a lovely taster meal in Bella cuba[cuban restaurant] -v small but lovely and intimate.
Breakfast in the morning was lovely, full irish -hot, not greasy just perfect.

I will certainly stay in this b&b again over other places ive stayed in dublin",5,2012,05,28
233,Charming and welcoming,"This is a very nice hotel in the east end of Dublin close to the DART train at Aviva stadium.  Staff were very nice.  The room was a bit small as expected but very charming.

It's a bit of a walk to central Dublin (about 30-40 mins) but it is in a nice area of town.",4,2012,05,26
233,"Great staff, Quiet room, Good Location","The staff here are ambassadors for Ireland - welcoming and helpful. The room was very quiet and we were able to sleep soundly and recover from our travel delay.  The breakfast was excellent as well.  This hotel is in a good, safe location.  After our two night stay, the staff helped us to our taxi and sent us off with some scones from our early train ride to Tralee.  A great experience..",5,2012,05,26
233,Welcoming Staff and Large Room!,"Dublin was the first stop on our trip, and we arrived at the Ariel House around 8 in the morning to be greeted with tea and pastries and a very warm Irish welcome!  Of course our room was not ready to be checked into yet, but we were informed that it should be ready around noon and that we could leave our bags with the staff while we went out into the city.  We came back to the hotel around 1pm, and found our room ready and our bags already in our room.

We stayed in the Herbert Mews part of the Ariel House, and our room faced the front of the hotel (plenty of natural light came into the room).  However, and this is my only complaint about the place, the room was under the main entrance, so in the morning it was slightly noisy with people walking around above us.  We chose the less expensive room in the Herbert Mews section, because we were on a budget, so I knew that we would be on the ground level.  I just may recommend to others if you have a little extra money to stay on the first or second floor.   

Everything else about the hotel was marvelous!  Extremely helpful staff, who helped us out with directions, bus timetables, recommendations, and even ordered us a taxi for our departure.  Breakfast, just like everyone says was amazing. Just to give you an idea of the variety of the menu. We had the potato cakes with smoked salmon, the traditional Irish breakfast, poached eggs with bacon, and poached eggs with smoked salmon.  The staff in the breakfast room was also very professional and efficient.  The room itself was very large for European standards, and the bathroom was huge with an excellent shower.  Also, a very easy commute from the airport: we took the Aircoach bus from the Airport, and it let us off at the Pembroke Road stop, which was less than 2 blocks away from the Ariel House.  I know other reviewers have mentioned that this hotel is a bit farther out of the city center, which it true, but definitely only about a 15 minute walk into the center and very easily accessible to bus routes.  We took a taxi from Ariel to the Heuston Train Station, and the cost of the ride was about 16 euro, which we thought was very reasonable.

Overall, the stay at the Ariel House was very pleasant, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a lovely and unique experience!",5,2012,05,24
233,"Wonderful hotel, wonderful staff","We recently stayed at Ariel House for a week, with our 4th grader. Everything about our stay was perfect. Excellent breakfast, extremely friendly and helpful staff, perfect location and reasonably priced. If (when!) we return to Dublin, we will definitely stay here again.",5,2012,05,24
233,"Welcoming staff, charming atmosphere, highly recommended","The staff was so welcoming and accommodating, particularly about letting us park our car before check-in. We knew check-in wasn't until 2 p.m., but had heard we could park our car early. And that was correct. We were allowed to park our car for the day, and the minute we arrived at the hotel we were offed tea and scones -- so comforting since we landed at 6 a.m. and had quite a difficult time getting from the Dublin airport to Ariel House. 

The bed and breakfast-style hotel was clean and well kept, especially for a more historic building. The room was large and comfortable. And the backyard view from the dining room was so lovely. Ariel House was also in good proximity to a few local sites, including Aviva Stadium. And while it was a long walk, about 35 to 40 minutes, Ariel House was in walking distance to Trinity College. 

We highly recommend Ariel House. In fact, we expect to stay there again next time we're in Dublin.",5,2012,05,21
233,A place to relax!,"This full service hotel is absolutely amazing, and will absolutely stay here if I return to Dublin. We arrived a little early so the (very friendly!!!) front desk staff put us in a my room.",5,2012,05,21
233,Dublin Weekend 4-6 May 2012,"The stay at Ariel House really made our weekend in Dublin that bit more special.  Nothing was too much trouble for the great staff, whether it was day or night you had a query or came back in from a night out.  The breakfast was also amazing with a tremendous choice that really set you up for the day.  No problem recommending and also the excellent transport into the city less than 100m away was very convenient.",5,2012,05,08
233,Home away from Home.,"We stayed for three nights at the beginning of our Ireland vacation in mid April.  We had a room that slept four; two queen size beds, with in suite bathroom.  Check in and checkout was quick.  The staff was friendly and helpful with everything from directions, calling a taxi, or recommendations for local restaurants.  The breakfast included cold cereals, pastries, fruit juices, water, milk, eggs to order, full Irish breakfast and the BEST brown bread we had in Ireland.  Parking is available, though limited to about 6 or 7 spaces.  This worked for us as we parked at check in and did not move the car until we left Dublin.  The room was clean, plenty of towels and pillows.  Only downside was the very low water pressure in the shower.  I would recommend the Ariel house and would stay again if I am ever back in Dublin.",5,2012,05,07
233,Top notch service and stay,"Would recommend this place to anyone. Food was great, rooms were large and the amenities were generous. Everyone was helpful and attentive. Our only glitch was that we couldn't get to our room when we wanted to because the road was closed for a rugby match at a nearby stadium. We ended up killing time by eating at a Chipotle knock-off.",5,2012,05,05
233,Perfection for a price you simply cannot refuse.,"A friend and I stayed with our new freinds from the Ariel House the last week of April.  What can I say about the Ariel House that isn't glowing.  There was a tiny corner of wall paper pealing away from the wall in an inconspicuous place.  

Other than that, I have never enjoyed European accomindations as much in all of my travels, and I travel a great deal.

The staff was simply perfect.  Non intrusive, yet attentive.  Able to know what you need before you ask.  Able to answer questions with authority.  Able to lead you down the right path, and always glad to do so.  

The beds are comfy.  The bathrooms are huge by European standards.  The breakfast delightful, and the coffee, perfect.  

I promise, if you don't enjoy a stay here, you won't enjoy staying anywhere.

Thank you for a wonderful time!!",5,2012,05,01
233,Great Hotel,"We have just returned from a three day stay at the Ariel House Hotel, which we had booked after reading positive reviews on Trip Adviser.  We were not disappointed.  It is a great hotel, located in a quiet leafy suburb close to DART station and local bus stops.  We had rooms in the Herbert Mews - comfortable bed and pillows, clean room and bathroom, soft towels and a pleasant view over the garden.  There was an excellent selection of foods at breakfast, the staff were helpful and pleasant and we never had to wait long for our cooked choices to arrive.  Reception staff offered suggestions for visits and were helpful in booking our river cruise.  The spacious lounge always had refreshments available.  From here, we were able to watch the orderly crowd leave the Aviva Stadium after the Rugby Union Semi-final.
Staying at the Ariel House Hotel definitly added to the enjoyment of our four day stay in Dublin. We will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and we hope to return some time in the not too distant future.",5,2012,04,30
233,Great find!!!,"We spent a great four nights at Ariel House with our son and daughter-in-law. The rooms were very clean, tidy and warm. The georgian/victorian decor was amazing. Good to have cake, tea coffee in the lovely residents lounge after a day out exploring. Very convenient for trips into the city centre, an easy 20/30 minute walk, or you could of course catch 'The Dart' from Lansdowne Road station-a couple of minutes walk away. The staff were, without exception, friendly, helpful and professional.Great recommendations for places to eat in the evenings.The staff went out of their way to find us a great place to eat when everywhere appeared to be booked. Even managed to find us a couple of tickets for the Heiniken Cup semi at the Aviva Stadium! Would thoroughly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable place to stay, convenient for the city centre. We will return!",5,2012,04,30
233,Birthday weekend,"Having never been to Dublin and looking for somewhere nice to take my family away to celebrate my wife's birthday,  we booked in for the weekend. It was just perfect. The rooms are lovely, and it has a very relaxed atmosphere. The staff are very welcoming and professional.  Amazing breakfasts and chocolate cake! Very easy to get in and out of the centre.  Overall it was perfect for us and when I come to Dublin it will definitely be the place that I stay.",5,2012,04,29
233,Great place to stay,"On arrival we were upgraded to a junior suite, which was a very pleasant surprise. Room was lovely, large and had a wonderful four poster bed. 
Breakfast had a good selection and service very good. 
Hotel is right next to the Aviva stadium and a very short walk to the Lansdowne road train station. So easy access to the centre of dublin. 
So would certainly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,04,29
233,Brilliant gem,"Took my mum here for a wee break in April. We had been given a ground floor room as requested, which was perfect once mum had got up the outside steps( the only problem for her).
The room was very comfortable, very quiet, traditionally furnished, with high Georgian ceiling and fantastically comfortable beds.Our en-suite was very clean,warm and bright. In short, the facilities were first class, and much more than we expected for the very reasonable price.The whole house seemed extremely well-run, and in particular guests seemed to appreciate the spacious and traditionally furnished lounge with a large fireplace, grand piano, daily papers,and refreshments available all day.The breakfasts were fantastic, a lovely selection of homemade baking and cooking, as well as a full range of local produce, all in a bright dining-room with a view of  cherry trees in blossom. 
All the staff were genuinely helpful and considerate, and we would heartily recommend this lovely guest house to anyone.
Just one warning- be aware that it is very near Lansdowne Road sports stadium, so if you are NOT going for a match, make sure that you don't need to us your car that day- it's impossible to get in or out of the area. Having said that, it is a fantastically leafy part of Dublin, so well worth  visiting. Oh, and the bistro at Ballsgate is a great place for dinner in the evening!",5,2012,04,25
233,almost perfect,"I decided to book ariel house based on the reviews on trip adviser. As always they were spot on. the house is beautiful.  The bedrooms were spotless.  When we arrived after a 4 hour drive it was lovely to relax in the drawing room with complimentary coffee, cake and biscuits. the girl on reception was friendly and helpful. Ariel house is perfect for anyone attending the RDS or the Aviva Stadium, literally a few minutes walk away.  Its a bit too far to walk to the city centre but the Dart (train) is only a couple of minutes walk away. Get off at Tara Street 2 stops away. I said almost perfect as we had a 50 minute wait for breakfast due to most of the other guests also deciding to eat at 9am.  However that said the food was delicious and on checkout the manager did apologise for the wait.  This would not put me off staying here again as I was otherwise very impressed.",4,2012,04,14
233,Great guest house,"I came across this guest house the day before my trip. I saw many good reviews on trip advisor and decided to book it.
I did not regret it, as my stay there was brilliant! Location is great, easy access from the airport with the Aircoach, less than 1min talk to the Dart station, which takes you to the city centre in less than 10 min.
Our room was on the ground floor and I really liked the decoration, the bathroom was clean and modern.
The guest house is from the georgian times and it has high ceilings, and it is very charming overall.The lounge is very comfortable and cosy, great to relax with a cup of tea and some cake or biscuits, all complimentary, while reading the paper or one of the books available. The pianoforte is beautiful and complements the charm of the place.
The only suggestion I would make is that it would be good if the bathroom fan was in a separate switch to the light, as it can be a bit noisy at night.
Staff is very friendly and helpful and breakfast was very good.
It was a great stay and I definitely recommend it.",5,2012,04,10
233,Pleasant Stay,"My wife and I had 2 nights of pleasant stay there during the St Patrick's weekend.  We were greeted with tea and biscuit when we first arrived, staff there are very friendly and helpful.  Room itself is very nice and quiet.

The hotel itself is about 30 mins walk from the city centre, bit far for some people but it depends how you like to explore the city.  We think the best way to see a place is by foot -  a lot of walking around.  The walk from the hotel to the city centre is peaceful and safe.

There is also a Dart station (metro) 1 min walk from the hotel where you can catch the train into the city centre, it take about 5-10 mins, very convenient.  The only thing is, Dart runs to 8pm or something I can't remember, so if you are out at night you will need to catch the taxi. Taxi in Dublin is not expensive at all, it costs us about 12-15 euro one way.  

The Ariel House is famous for its Irish breakfast, apparently they have won an award for it.  We gave it go and were happy with it.  It costs 11 euros each which we thought it's slightly expensive but it's worth it.  

They even gave us a small pot of shamrock because of the St Patrick's Day!",5,2012,04,09
233,Great stay,"This  hotel is a bit out of city centre but once you get there it is absolutely lovely.  The service was great, there is afternoon tea and cake in the drawing room and the place just feels homely.

You can get dropped off on the shuttle bus to get here from the airport and it is about 5mins walk.

However, to walk to city centre is about 20-30mins.  The dart is very close but we found that the dart goes to minimum places.  Eg if you want to go to the Guinness Storehouse you would need to walk for another 20mins from Tara St.  

Would definitely recommend for couples, but maybe abit of a hassle if going partying.",5,2012,04,09
233,Perfect Place to stay,"I stayed at Ariel House for a long term stay and I can say nothing else but that it was a perfect place. When I arrived my baggage was brought up to my room and the room itself was comfortable and very clean. Even though I thought it might be a little bit loud since the house is next to the DART station, it was not at all. And I did not notice the cars on the street either! 
The house is about 20-25 minutes away from the city centre, but you can also take the DART which gets you there in about 10 minutes.

The staff was very friendly, they helped me with every thing I needed and I could ask them for anything at each time of the day. 
The breakfast was excellent, too. They had a large variety of food on the buffet and you could order from the menu additionally without extra payment. Since I stayed for 5 weeks, I also ordered things that were not on the menu without any problem. So the breakfast was really worth its price, you could not ask for anything else!

I would recommend Ariel House to everybody visiting Dublin, because the house is well-tended, the staff and management extremely kind and the breakfast delicious!!! Ariel House is one of the best accomodations I stayed in!",5,2012,04,08
233,Fantastic!,"What can I say?? We have just spent 5 wonderful days in Dublin staying at Ariel House.
The B & B is actually like a small hotel and is beautifully presented with quality furniture, drapes, bedding. we had a very comfy king size bed room (250) and a lovely clean comfortable room. The breakfast is amazing!!! great choice with very attentive service.
The reception staff are very polite and incredibly helpful. The location is faultless, 2 minute walk to the Dart station which took 5 minutes to get into the City centre.
We hired a car for trips out of the city and we must recommend the Wicklow Mountains they are breath taking. We will defiantly recommend Ariel House and will certainly be returning next time we visit Dublin! Thank you so much!",5,2012,04,03
233,Wow service Wow Food,"We just had to write a few lines on Ariel house,the staff,rooms and service was simply stunning. My family and I chose here after we saw it on the top 10 hotels in Dublin. A chic intimate cosy place in a quiet location just outside the main city centre.
The best surprise of all was the breakfast,I can truly say this was an unbelievable experience, the quality of the fresh fruit,pastries and my favourite the Irish breakfast was amazing. Not rushed perfect service all round it was Wow",5,2012,04,03
233,"Clean, excellent staff & great location",My girlfriend & I stayed here over St. Paddy's day weekend and we could not have picked a better B&B. The staff was amazing and the room was big enough for both of us and all our bags. The location was great for the price per night and allowed for a quiet place to land after late nights out.,5,2012,04,02
233,Cozy with character plus nice and quiet,"We picked this place because of previous reviews and were not disappointed.  Lovely place, beautiful street - and as promised for us jet-lagged sleepers-it was quiet.  Rooms are small as you'd expect in an urban hotel.  We didn't use mass transit to get into town but saw the convenient bus stop and cab fare wouldn't be too bad as it's pretty close.  The breakfast room is nice and comfy as is the lounge.  Staff was helpful.",5,2012,03,30
233,A Bit Disappointed,"Let me begin by saying that the staff and location could not be beat.  We stayed here over St. Patricks weekend to finish up our week and a half Ireland trip.  Staff was extremely helpful and courteous.  Breakfast was excellent - and they even served us a quick breakfast before hours in order for us to catch our cab to the airport.  Hotel was on quiet street, only 20 minute walk to Dublin City Centre.  Afternoon tea and home baked breads/desserts were outstanding.  Very relaxing sitting room.  Our family room, however, was a bit disappointing.  Room was downstairs, dark and just average.  Bathroom was not very clean.  When compared to other hotels we had recently stayed at, Euro 250 a night did not seem like a very good value for what we received. Perhaps a non-family room is better, but would not be my first choice if staying in Dublin again with my family (2 adults; 2 kids).  Really wanted to like this place more than me did.",3,2012,03,27
233,Very nice.,"Lovely B&B in a great location, friendly and accommodating staff.",5,2012,03,25
233,Dublin home-from-home,"Even though my meeting was across town, a visit to Dublin wouldn't be the same without a stay at Ariel House. My only complaints were that the bed was too comfortable, and the breakfasts too good (I'm sure I put on weight). It was lovely  to be back for another stay.",5,2012,03,15
233,Could not be beat!!,"We stayed in the Ariel house for two nights in early march. Arrived at the hotel early and were pleased to find out we could check in early. The room was very spacious and clean. Some slight scuffs and scrapes on the paintwork where furniture had been moved around but nothing to bother us. The staff we're very friendly and we were given coffee and scones in the drawing room before we went off to explore. The hotel is a good 25 minute walk out of the main town but we were happy to do this as it wasn't a bad walk. The dart station is less than 2 minute walk and was only a few euros return if you don't fancy the long walk. The staff were really helpful with recommendations of restaurants and places to visit. 
The hotel is on a very quiet street and the bed was extremely comfortable. Bathroom was clean however on our second evening we did start to run out of hot water but we managed fine. Breakfast was beautiful and you must not miss out.

Cannot heap enough praise on the staff they are what make the hotel feel so welcoming. I left my car key on departure and they were very helpful and returned it to me very quickly.

Thanks for a lovely break!",5,2012,03,15
233,Great Stay,"We stayed here for five nights in early March - made a last-minute reservation change to this property after finding an amazing deal on Expedia.com. Hotel is lovely and the staff is very friendly. The room was much larger than you usually find in European hotels. Everything was neat and clean. Only ""complaint"" was that it took forever for the water to warm up and even then it wasn't hot...so we took short showers. Otherwise it was perfect. The location is very nice - more of a residential area which is a nice change depending on your plans. We parked a rental car for free and enjoyed walking around the neighborhood. Although you could walk into Dublin, it's a bit of a hike. However, the DART train is right down the block. Overall, I highly recommend the Ariel House!",4,2012,03,12
233,Excellent,"We are 4 persons and got Family room Number 258 , Room was so nice ,clean, spacious and comfortable. Breakfast was great. Strong Wifi signal. Free parking . near DART. Friendly staff. 

The hotel's staff at front desk on 4th march about 9.00-12.00 was so friendly helpful and great service mind . She arranged Scones Birthday for my husband birthday. You make our day !!!",5,2012,03,08
233,Home away from home,In common with most other reviews I could not recommend this hotel highly enough. Everything about the place was exceptional and the staff could not have been more helpful. We were upgraded to room 251 which had a wonderful four poster bed and a very spacious bathroom . We had gone to Dublin for the rugby and the hotel could not have been better located for the stadium. The following morning the breakfast fully lived up to the expectations set by the reviews we had read.  All in all we will definitely return every two years from now on !,5,2012,03,02
233,"Charming hotel, great breakfast, a bit noisy","Stayed here June 2010 on the main floor. It seemed like there was constantly someone walking around above us, so if I were to stay here again, I'd ask for a top floor room.
The breakfast was really good and in a charming, bright breakfast room.
Staff was hit and miss - some were warm and friendly, others had better things to do. 
Location was ok - it took us about 20 minutes power walking to make it to Grafton st area. But nice to be in quiet residential area.",4,2012,03,01
233,Very Personal Service,"Ariel House had very personal staff who were determined you would enjoy your stay. They had their customers service to the forefront of their minds. The rooms were small but comfortable. I did notice that, like another customer mentioned, that a ground floor exit door was open. I believe it is to air the hallways but I couldn't say if it was accessible from the main road, which made me a little uncomfortable. They recommend and booked our restaurant which was very good-they got us a table at short notice also which was wonderful. Homemade biscuits, cake & coffee in the communal area was an appreciated touch-esp when you arrive back at 11pm. They couldn't be closer to the Lansdowne Rd (you get off that stop of the dart, go left away from the stadium and its on your right). Its a 5 min walk to the RDS also-handy for the horse show. Breakfast was nice-you can order what you want for €11 so go for it!",4,2012,02,29
233,Fantastic Service,"My husband took me away to Dublin for the Valentines weekend and we stayed at the Ariel Guest House. The place was conveniently located, right next to the DART station and 2 stops away from Tara Station which took us to Temple Bar and all the sights in the city and a short walk from the Airc Coach stop which took us to and from the airport. The rooms were well decorated and spacious and  the staff were very friendly! We had their famous breakfast on both days and it was absolutely delicious as was their complementary fresh cakes and biscuits that they set out for all guests. We had a fantastic time and would definitely recommend this guest house and would definitely stay there again.",5,2012,02,20
233,Like staying with good friends!!,"From start to finish we were treated like royalty. Nothing was too much trouble for any one member of the fantastic team at aerial house. The breakfast was amazing, Irish food at its best, homemade and filling! We stayed in a family room, which was not only huge but had a beautiful bay window letting in lots of natural light.. Will definitely be Visiting again!! 
",5,2012,02,18
233,Quality establishment,Stayed here after reading other reviews.  Excellent location and very comfortable and safe environment.  Less than a minute on foot to train station.  Secure parking at house.  Staff at reception (day and night) could not be more helpful and accomodating.   A really outstanding place to stay at a very reasonable price.  Would definitely return.,5,2012,02,18
233,Ariel House - Feb 14th 2012,"Ran out of superlatives for this hotel when describing to friends/family. 

Were happy to help set up various surprises for my girlfriend on Feb 14th so when we checked in there were flowers/chocolates/ice bucket already set up and laid out nicely. The staff actually seemed to want us to have a lovely time which was a new experience for me at least. Had a great day, with restaurant recommendations from reception as well, I couldn't thank them enough the next morning.

Room was brilliant, huge, comfy bed with massive high impressive ceilings and lovely vintage furnitage. Didn't go for the breakfast so can't comment on the restaurant.

Overall, couldn't have been more helpful and friendly welcome in a nicer setting, will definetly try and stay again next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2012,02,17
233,Home from home in city centre,"Ariel House is a haven of peace and tranquility. We enjoyed superb, traditionally furnished rooms (have stayed twice), and a quality of service that, sadly, is rarely found nowadays. Guests can enjoy the spacious lounge, with complimentary newspapers and tea/coffee. There is no bar, but they are plenty and varied comfortable stroll/short taxi away. The Dart station (and the Aviva stadium) is about a minute away, so you can leave the car at the hotel and save the hassle and expense of downtown parking. The service and fare at breakfast are excellent (rare praise from someone who can be hard to please at this hour of the day. I would not consider staying anywhere else in central Dublin.",5,2012,02,12
233,Home from home,"Ariel House is a pair of Georgian houses in beautiful leafy Dublin 4.  This is a “real Dublin” place to stay.  Friendly, furnished with antique furniture, comfortable and unique.  I had a room upstairs for my last stay, with a beautiful view of Dublin at night.  There’s a big front room to sit in and have a glass of wine in the evening.  Relaxing, well-run and comfortable, with really nice staff and a very pleasant breakfast in the morning.  The Dart (train) station is just opposite or, if you like walking, it's a really nice walk into the city centre.  I always look forward to staying here, a home from home, and one that I would definitely recommend.",5,2012,02,07
233,Really Dreadful - I'm confused by reviews,"I have to say that I am really confused by the reviews for Ariel House - they are at absolute odds with my own recent experience of staying there.  I stayed for two nights last weekend.  My room was a twin bedded dark and dreary room in the basement of the adjoining building.  On arrival, in the rain, and having stuggled up the steps with my cases, the girl behind reception stayed at her post and didn't help me with the door or my bags.  When I reached my room, I was quite suprised to find that there was no face cloth or shower cap.  I was going out that evening, and when I was leaving I asked if it would be possible to have a face cloth.  The same girl at reception told me that she would check if 'we have any'!

I was quite suprised to find on both nights that when I returned to the hotel, after dark, an emergency exit door opposite my room was wide open on both occassions, with the wind and rain blowing in.  But the worst was yet to come....

On Monday morning I awoke to find that there was no hot water in my bathroom.  I rang reception and was told that it had broken down overnight in the area of the hotel that I was in.  The receptionist told me that I would be very welcome to come up to reception and have a shower that was adjacent to reception.  However, now running late for an important meeting - this didn't appeal.  I was genuinely shocked that after a mediocre breakfast, upon checkout, there was no apology nor reduction in price for the fact that I was unable to shower in my room.  

Overall, this was an extremely disappointing experience, and although I had gotten a special rate of €75 per night B and B, it is a pity.  I am attending a course in Dublin on weekends for the next 3 years - I had hoped that Areil House would turn out to be my Dublin base.  But it certainly won't be.",1,2012,02,05
233,Absolute perfection - highlight of our trip!,"I joined TripAdvisor to leave this positive review of an unusually outstanding B&B. It feels like I spent weeks looking for the right spot in Dublin during our combined business/pleasure trip. It seemed like hotels were either central to downtown but super noisy at night, central-ish but really expensive, or far out of town but quiet and affordable. I finally read about Ariel House and the service and ""best of"" awards they've won. Their location was perfect for us because it's far enough out that it was indeed quiet and laid-back, but a quarter block away from the DART that takes you right into downtown in two quick stops (like 10 minutes total). 

In every way, Ariel House exceeded our expectations: they prepped a room for our early arrival at 10 am, and even though we hadn't paid for breakfast sat us down with tea and treats while they carried up our luggage. We caught a great winter deal that was super affordable, but were put up in a large jr. suite that had a HUGE bed that was the best of our trip. Everything was well appointed, beautiful, but well-loved and comfortable. The staff was consistently and constantly friendly, helpful, and attentive. They helped us hook up with a rental car and there's free parking right at the front door. 

We really loved Ireland for many reasons, but Ariel House was a big part of that experience. I can't imagine staying anywhere else when we return!",5,2012,02,03
233,What a find,"We stayed in the lead up to Christmas in the Ariel and will rave about our stay. From check in to our departure we couldn't fault the staff nor the welcome. We arrived late and were able to sit in the comfy lounge with the tv remote enjoying a pizza delivery. We felt like lord and lady of the manor.,especially when we found the complimentary freshly baked treats and brewed coffee. Our room he a little dated, was spacious and warm. The bed was comfortable but i have to admit i would have preferred a duvet.
We were very impressed with the breakfast, the produce was top quality.
Transport to and from town couldn't be easier with the dart so location is ideal.
Just to evidence my very positive comments about the staff- i dropped a favourite lipstick and it was posted to me straight away. I think that says it all where housekeeping integrity and thoroughness goes.
Enjoy- we did",4,2012,01,22
233,Quaint,"My daughter and I stayed in this hotel for three nights - the room we had was large with a very big window facing out onto the back of the hotel. The lighting in the room was poor - no main light - only bedside lights - I had to ask for an additional lamp to be brougt to the room as I found it too dark. The bathroom was not in the best of conditions paintwork and plasterwork was not perfect. The beds were most comfortable. The breakfast was good - yogurt was warm though - staff were lovely. A cosy hotel, warm and friendly. ",5,2012,01,15
233,Best for family,"We are a family of five who stayed at Ariel House 2 nights, a double room for the parents and an enormous family room for the kids.  Best hotel for value.  There are many things about this hotel that are superior and preferable to a five star hotel:  First, the hospitality. Every single staff member made us feel most welcome, and had great recommendations for restaurants and activities.  Second, the free baked treats and coffee/tea, all the time. Third, hotel feels appropriately old and victorian, but bathrooms are modern and spotless.  Last, free, fast Internet.  Amazingly, large hotels still charge for this (12 euro /day at Four Seasons).  Last, location.  Not too far from the city centre, next door to public transport.",5,2011,12,30
233,Very comfortable and friendly,Altogether a delightful 3 night stay.  Excellent breakasts.,4,2011,12,20
233,What's not to love about Dublin,"Friendly and quiet place slightly outside the city center. You need the DART or bus to get to city center, which will cost you about 5 euro per day for two return. But located right next to DART so very convenient. Truly great breakfast, nice lounge to sit or read in the evening. Basically only two small minor points: double bed was small for two people not normally sharing a bed together (two single beds would have given both of us a better nights rests) and the water pressure was not very strong when the temperature was turned up. 
Otherwise great place to stay and would definitely recommend.",4,2011,12,18
233,Perfect Place - Highly Recommend,"So we decided to do a crazy 28 hours from Sheffield to Dublin. We changed our mind from a different hotel to the Ariel House and im so glad that we did. We spent the first half of the morning up and down Temple Bar, the city centre, and near he Samuel Beckett bridge. We couldnt check in the room until 2pm but after being up since 3 - trawled with the one suitcase to look for his hotel. Its well set from the road so you don't hear the traffic noise and has a lovely, family feel to it the minute you walk through the door. We were early so we were asked to wait in the drawing room ( piano, log fire, comfy sofas ) while the kind lady checked if our room was ready. Result - it was so we went up to see the Superior Double room. Great facilities, loads of space, nicely decorated with an antique feel behind the room but still classy. Enjoyed the afternoon treats which the hotel put on with banana bread, cakes, buns and tea/coffee. Then we took a little walk into the village, about 15 minutes away where there are a few little shops, park and a couple of pubs and places to eat. Landsdown stadium is a stones throw away so that's good if you want to catch a game on there. The aircoach bus we caught from the airport just stops around the corner. Lovely place, lovely people and will 100% stay here if/when we visit again next",5,2011,11,29
233,Will definitely be back!,"I have stayed in many b&bs and guesthouses and I have to say this was one of the best. The location is great as it is less than a minute to the dart and there is parking at the guesthouse also. The rooms are spacious with all the necessities and breakfast is delicious. I will definitely reccomend this guesthouse , it is excellent value for money and the staff couldn't be nicer!",5,2011,11,29
233,"Great Hotel, Great location","We spent 4 nights at this hotel. It is a great hotel in nice neighborhood. It is very close to the train station, which takes you to downtown very fast. The staff are lovely and helpful. Their breakfast is heavenly. Overall, we had a lovely stay in Dublin thanks to Ariel house and its staff.",5,2011,11,28
233,Cozy room in a stylish hotel,We loved staying in this Georgian style hotel with antiques in every room.  It has been nicely remodeled and our room was immaculate.  Breakfast was excellent and a perfect start to our days.  It is a 2 min walk to the DART station for a quick ride into center city.  Staff are very  helpful.  Would definitely stay here again!,5,2011,11,27
233,5 Star accommodation and value in Dublin 4,"Stayed here for the second time this week and once again found this place to be the jewel in the crown of Ballsbridge. Warm, sincere and friendly welcome from Lana (apologies for incorrect spelling) and the placed oozed a welcoming atmosphere. We were given room 215 which is a deluxe room with a four poster bed and a wonderful Georgian ceiling and fireplace. 

Location is great for restaurants, pubs and theatres in the area - all within walking distance. 

Great night's sleep for a city centre location and breakfast the following morning was served in bright and comfortable conservatory overlooking the new Aviva stadium. Great choice (pancakes fab) and a B&B rate of €69 in our view underpriced. Great service, will be back again hopefully in the near future. Thanks folks.",5,2011,11,20
233,The best among the rest!,"A warm welcome, a lovely stay, a friendly staff, a delicious breakfast, top it up with a smile and you get Ariel House!
There are few words that can describe my wonderful stay at Ariel House, from the first welcome to the last goodbye, everything felt perfect!
I had the pleasure of staying in one of the Superior Twin Bedrooms and when I first opened the door my jaw dropped because there are no pictures that can prepare you to what you will really find, the room was bigger than I expected filled with all the amenities you'll need!
In the morning, in a beautiful room with a large window overlooking a well-kept garden, a delicious breakfast waits for you that lives up to what Ariel House is best known for in Dublin.
I only feel sorry for not spending a couple of days longer so I could try the rest of the menu! Need a suggestion? Pick the Pancake Stack with Winter Berries and Créme Fraiche, you will not regret it!
If you have any doubts or need any help, ask any member of the staff an they will be glad to help you. Need any information, suggestions to get the most of your stay in Dublin, tickets to a show, directions or advices ask the conciérge and they will help you with whatever they can, always with a smile.
Located in a quiet street, in Ballsbridge, 5 minutes away from the city centre by train or bus, both right around the corner, in a victorian neighbourhood a gorgeus red bricked house was the start to a stay in Doublin I will never forget!
Ariel House surpassed all of my expectations! In the city I fell in love with, I found a place where I feel right at home.
I thank all the staff at Ariel House for this wonderful stay.
Thank you Deirdre, Jennie, and everyone else for your hard work, I couldn't ask for more!
You will be seeing me a lot more from now on, as soon as possible!",5,2011,11,18
233,"6 nights to come ""home"" to Ariel House after long days of touring Ireland was perfect.","We spent 6 nights at Ariel house on our Ireland vacation. We opted not to try our hand at driving on the ""correct"" side of the road and took long rail day trips out from Dublin. Great accommodations and service. Lovely room and fabulous breakfast. Only drawback was distance from city centre. Public transport didn't run early enough to get us where we needed to be on time. Taxi's were required and very costly.",4,2011,11,18
233,Excellent service with a smile,"Having read the reviews in Tripadvisor we were hopeful that we would like the hotel and we were not disappointed.A lot of time has been spent in making sure that the clients were well looked after and information as what to do, where to go etc. was willingly given with a smile. Very easy to get to Dublin Centre by bus and, although we didn't use it the train/metro. We enjoy walking but it took longer than the 20 minutes that was claimed to reach the City Centre but we are oldies!
We have no hesitation in recommending this lovely hotel",5,2011,11,11
233,Patrick  Melbourne Australia,"What a wonderful place to stay! 10 star all the way. Where can i start? Host/hostess's absolutely brilliant! accomodation excellent! breakfasts (full Irish)to die for! coffee, the best in Europe. Have been to Rome Paris Amsterdam on this trip & Ariel House Dublin was way ahead of them all in rates, breakfasts, room & staff. Location also great as Dart(train) was just 50 metres away to get into Dublin city centre. Ballsbridge is the place to stay in Dublin as has beautiful surrounds & still only 20 mins.to airport.We went to Bray (south) & Howth (north) on Dart.Will definitely be back for more,Highly reccomend Ariel House as the place to stay in Dublin.  Patrick.",5,2011,11,11
233,Beautiful guesthouse with great food and staff that obviously take a pride in their establishment.,"I stayed here in March and so got a very good deal on my double room since that is before the tourism season really kicks off. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a more expensive room upon arrival and I was just blown away with how lovely our room and the rest of the house were. The building itself is very impressive and the decor has obviously been finished to a very high standard. The only thing I could say remotely negative is that the wires for the television and kettle in our room looked a bit messy and prominent. Apart from that the room was pretty near perfect!

The breakfast was delicious and I struggled trying to decide what I should pick from the menu as it was all so tempting.The banana bread was out of this world and I would love to get my hands on their recipe!

The guesthouse is a 5-10 minute walk from a bus stop on a bus route that travels right through the heart of the city centre. Ballsbridge itself is quite pleasant (very leafy and lovely houses) and there are some great wee restaurants nearby.

After returning home and telling people about my trip I made a point of telling people how beautiful Ariel House had been and how much I had enjoyed staying there! If I was returning to Dublin I would definitely come back and I would happily pay the standard rate even at peak season!",5,2011,11,10
233,A few days in Dublin,"We stayed at Ariel house for 3 days in September.  It is very convenient for the city, being near Lansdowne Road Dart station, and also within walking distance.  The room was very clean, warm and comfortable.  The furniture was old fashioned, but quite adequate, and there was a flat screen tv.  and hospitality tray.  It was a 'basement ' room, as the reception and lounge were up steps from the garden, but it did look out over the front  garden.  The breakfasts were excellent with home made bread, scones and well cooked items.  The staff were very helpful with advice regarding how to get to places, and even printing out the directions.",4,2011,11,08
233,"Fabulous hotel, great value for money","Ariel House Hotel is a cut above...more like an old-fashioned country house in the heart of South Dublin city. I stayed in one of the family rooms, which was huge..2 double beds, high vaulted ceiling, bath and tea/coffee facilities.
The beds are really comfy and it's a quiet location next to Landsdowne Road.
There is a drawing room just off reception with gorgeous armchairs and couches, a grand piano, filtered coffee and home made cakes and biscuits available all day.
There is a cold buffet for breakfast and a menu for the hot food which is cooked to order....
I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2011,11,02
233,What a marvelous stay we had!,"We stayed the week of October 15-23, 2011 and I can't rave enough about the wonderful service, staff, rooms, location of the Ariel House.  

The walk to the Dart was literally 2 minutes away and it had you in city center in 2 stops!

Breakfast was superb and there were many choices for all tastes and diet restrictions.

Safe, upscale area with great restaurants made walking to the Pub or a fashionable dinner, easy, time-saving and fun.  

If we make it back to Dublin again, this will definitely be ""our"" spot to stay.",5,2011,10,30
233,Friendly staff in a lovely area,"I always stay here when I come to dublin. no matter when I arrive or whether the staff know me they are friendly and welcoming. The rooms are always clean and very comfortable.
The area is quiet but has easy access to the city by train (<5min). It is within walking distance of some fine dining and pubs.
The rooms are tastefully decorated although the wardrobes do live up to their antique looks.
Best is the tea and snacks on arrival as well as the lovely full irish breakfast buffet.",5,2011,10,27
233,Ariel House ticks all the boxes,"We have been to Ireland 4 times and it was only on our third trip that we came across Ariel House. After this stay we decided that when travelling to Dublin we wouldn’t waste our time trying to find a better place because we knew it would be difficult. We didn’t hesitate when booking our 4th trip to Dublin. Ariel House was our only consideration. In fact I highly recommended it to a group who were travelling with us and they were all very appreciative. The staff were wonderful and did what they could to help in any situation. We loved the idea of living in a Victorian house, even if it was only for 9 nights, as we felt surrounded by history and the wonderings of who inhabited the house over the many years. Our room was fantastic and the bed was so comfortable and being in the furniture game my husband is very picky in relation to beds in hotels and B&B’s. He had nothing to pick at in this case. We were able to use the wireless internet and did not experience any problems with this. We worked our way through the breakfast menu and must say the food was fresh, well cooked and well presented. The home baked brown bread and banana bread were favourites. We often skipped lunch because we were still full from breakfast. The breakfast room staff were positive, friendly and attentive.  My husband and I enjoyed the walk into the city as it was diverse and the view ranged from beautiful Georgian architecture to interesting pubs, parks and shops. If you have time it is worth walking to Trinity College and St Stephen’s green. If not, the bus route and the dart are very close. Words don’t seem enough to express our appreciation to Deirdre and her staff. And no, it did not cost us a small fortune. We loved our stay and will certainly return.",5,2011,10,27
233,What a wonderful place to stay in Dublin!,"We found Ariel House on an Italian web site (We're from the UK), and after reading some reviews and looking at the b&b photos, we decided to book a superior room. The room looked better in real life than in photos! A very pleasant b&b to stay, clean renovated room, Great breakfast and very friendly staff!
We can't wait to be back in Dublin, so we can stay at Ariel house once again :-)
Barak & Liron",5,2011,10,26
233,Needs a little work,"This place has potential.  It is a Georgian building so there are no lifts and a number of stairs.   The building has some period pieces but all items need to be kept up.  For example, we were in a room which had a dresser which was missing a handle which made opening the bottom drawer challenging and when trying to open the door to the dresser the handle would fall off.  This was not the only piece in the room with problems.  While overall in common areas the space is clean, in the room we stayed in there were a few issues.  There was some molding and mildew in the tub and the toilet internal rim had not been cleaned.  There was barely any water pressure in the shower and it took at least 5 minutes for the water to warm.  There were cobwebs on the ceiling and the carpets were dingy.  

The beds are comfortable but the pillows are flat.  We assumed because of the residential location that it would be quieter than it actually was.  The DART is indeed close and there are a few restaurants near the location.  The breakfast is good and is served in a nice looking room.  The staff is very nice and helpful.

Overall our experience was not negative but this place has potential to be fantastic if a few things were modified.",3,2011,10,23
233,Irish hospitality at its best,"Regretably we were only there for one night, but it was an absolute delight.
The rooms we were spacious with large comfertable beds and nice furnishings.
As stated in previous reviews the breakfasts were exceptional, infact our friend said
it was the best he had experienced any where in the world!",5,2011,10,17
233,Above average hotel in Dublin 4,"I enjoyed my stay. Clean room, elegant ambient. It is an old hotel but nicely kept up. You can tell that the management is professional. The area of the hotel is the upbeat, stylish embassy quarter of town. Downside: the heating was not adjustable ... The receptionist has a tool to turn the heat off or on, as the knob is missing. Room 245",3,2011,10,10
233,"""They have it figured out""","We stayed 2 nights at this beautiful property, (Sept 22/23) after traveling the Emerald Isle for 15 days. Let me tell you, Ariel House is a special place. It is immaculately clean. The staff (especially Jenny) are out of this world. The rooms are fabulous. The Irish breakfast is phenomenal. There is coffee and cookies and treats available all day/night. The staff are genuinely happy to please you. The only thing I do not understand is how come they do not rate as a top 5 property in Dublin. I am not sure what more they can do. I almost forgot about the location. It is only  a fifteen minute walk to downtown/Trinity College and a 5 minute walk to Aviva Stadium, and the hotel is located in a very quiet and elegant neighborhood. While our 15 days in Ireland were fantastic, I would return to Ariel House for a week in Dublin, just to enjoy this top notch property. Keep up the good work!!!",5,2011,10,02
233,"Very nice staff, great atmosphere!","Positive:

- very nice staff, accommodating and always friendly
- atmosphere makes you feel at home and you actually don't want to leave
- very clean, very tasteful furnishing, great rooms
- great value for money

Negative:

- Internet could be smoother (from time to time you get disconnected and have to log in again)

Overall, I can definitively recommend this place to everyone travelling to Dublin.",5,2011,10,02
233,A home from home,"As soon as we arrived we felt at home due to the very comfortable guest sitting room ( with comfy chairs, free newspapers, coffee, tea and cakes); we got there late evening and they called for a take away meal to be delivered and opened the breakfast room for us to eat it in rather than us having to eat in our room - the accommodation was very comfortable and spacious. Next day they booked us haircuts and gave us travel tips. Even after we had checked out we came back to collect bags and were given directions to our next destination, recommendations for a great hotel in out next port of call  and of course we were able to grab a coffee and cake! the home made bread at breakfast was fantastic. Thanks so much to Deirdre and the whole team for making us feel so at home. ",5,2011,09,26
233,Fantastic staff-Lovely property,"I was very pleased with this townhouse style guesthouse.  It is away from the noise and hustle of the city centre but you can get there with a pleasant 20 minute  walk. It was quiet..our room had charming antique furniture and was very clean with a nice bathroom.  Breakfast was very good in a lovely bright room.  The staff was really wonderful and we were impressed with how much they handle managing this place with the many guests, parking, recommendations, arranging cabs, etc. all with a smile.  We loved Dublin and would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2011,09,22
233,A beautiful place,"We stayed at the Ariel House during our first visit to Dublin. The hotel is in a quiet part of Dublin, but it is very near to the bus stop and the DART station, so it is most convenient to get anywhere from there. We started the day with a very rich breakfast after having slept well in the clean bed room that had all the amenities you need (e.g. hot water for coffee or tea, w-lan). Unfortunately, the room in the basement was a bit dark; but that was the only disadavantage. We were treated most politely,even friendly. The prize was indeed very moderate! The next time we visit Dublin we'll again stay at the Ariel - it is highly recommendable!",5,2011,09,18
233,Wonderful Staff,"We had two rooms in this B and B and the rooms were in the basement. The first one we got was very small and musty smelling. The next room we got for my daughter and son in law was much nicer. We had the guy next door banging on our room to keep quiet and we were just talking not even the TV was going. The staff, every last one we encountered was wonderful and made this B and B, a place I would go back and stay. They couldn't have been nicer. The food was also very good. I felt for a three night stay we could have gotten a better room as they were not full.",3,2011,09,17
233,Great value,"Our second stay at the Ariel and would not stay anywhere else.Right next to the Aviva stadium and a 20 minute walk to the city centre.Buses into the city stop at the end of the road a half mile away and the Dart railway stops at the stadium.
The Aircoach runs from the airport to the Ariel and drops you half a mile from the hotel.Get the Ballsbridge coach and get off at Pembroke Road.
The staff were first class and made our stay most enjoyable.Fine accommadation at a reasonablle price.",5,2011,09,16
233,AMAZING!,"This was the most stunning place I've ever stayed! Beautiful old house, the most AMAZING breakfast I've ever had!!! Very reasonable price...our only regret is we didn't stay longer! Book far ahead as it fills up months ahead of time.
The house was quiet and peaceful and only a short bus ride into the city (or we walked one day...was about 20 min walk). It is very close to a stadium but I don't know much about that I'm afraid! Word of warning: we were driving out of Dublin that morning & they shut the Lansdowne Road as there was a big football match on at the Stadium - so if you're looking to drive, perhaps check ahead. Free wi-fi too and lovely staff. Even let us check in early.",5,2011,09,13
233,Gracious and friendly,"The Areil house was more than a B&B, it was like staying with friends, the staff could not do more to make our stay more comfortable. They were always there with helpful suggestions and directions and just a little chat! We will miss you Deidre and Jenny! 
            The breakfst was delightful and the staff of lovely Irish young ladise were exceptional, I missed the first morning I was home! LOL! 
    All in all as the Irish say, ""Brillant"" Thank you! Donna Szafran",4,2011,09,13
233,Stress free family experience,"We stayed for 3 nights in late August traveling with 2 boys aged 6 and 10. Stayed in a family room. Fabulous huge room, well appointed ensuite including bath and shower and heated towel rail. Very quiet lovely suburb of Dublin. 2 mins walk to the DART (Lansdowne Road) and a short trip into Dublin City. Very friendly helpful staff, delicious breakfasts with a huge choice. Kids said the pancakes were the best ever! Lots of steps so probably not good for prams or wheelchairs but staff very helpful with luggage. Seemed popular with business people as well as tourists. Good value laundry service too.  Went on advice from Tripadvisor and was delighted. Totally surpassed expectations. ",5,2011,09,08
233,Wouldn't have stayed anywhere else!,"We stayed at Ariel House for a week and absolutely loved it!  The staff was friendly and helpful, the bedrooms and bathrooms were clean and spacious, and the food was absolutely wonderful!!! The DART station is literally a minute and a half walk and the rugby arena is right across from that.  Not only is Ariel House at a great location, but Ballsbridge is a lovely area to stay in!  Quiet and peaceful with a great little selection of pubs and restaurants as well as easy access to starbucks and a pharmacy.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else and we will be back as soon as we can!!!
Thank you, Ariel House, for making our stay so enjoyable!!!",5,2011,09,06
233,We loved it and we'll be back!,"We had a wonderful stay here, the bedroom was superb, staff very friendly, excellent breakfast, 2 mins to the DART station, lovely locality, this Hotel has it all, we will definitely be back.",5,2011,09,06
233,Great place to stay will def be going back !,"Booked the rugby match, birthday treat for hubby and exam treat for my daughter. She is crazy about rugby and got to see Ireland play 27th August . Booked guest house just for 1 night and it was a lovely experience. Having stayed all over Dublin mostly city centre I can say that Ariel House is one of the nicest I have stayed in. Lovely and clean home from home really could not fault it in any way. Close to Dart which we used Sat nite to go in for a meal but think the next time we are down we will eat round this area . I feel Dublin centre, well Temple Bar area has become very trashy over the last few years I know I wont be staying in the centre again ! Going to explore Dublin 4 and beyond now !
Will be booking again shortly !",5,2011,09,02
233,probably the best of its kind we have stayed in,"The service in Ariel House is first-class - attentive, caring front-of-house staff and friendly, responsive breakfast-room staff.  Our room was really a mini-suite, with a decent bathroom, comfortable big bed, settee, comfy chairs, table and flat-screen tv.  We travelled on public transport, so having the DART almost literally on our doorstep was a great boon.  Otherwise, a 5 minute walk takes you to regular bus-stops.  Its not too far to consider walking to the city centre and we did indeed walk alongside the nearby river all the way to Docklands.  We know that balanced reviews are best but its hard to find the negatives alongside the free wifi, free coffee and biscuits throughout the day, free daily newspapers, and a breakfast that makes getting up really worthwhile.  Sorry, but we are just smitten with Ariel House!",5,2011,08,31
233,Charming Place to Stay,"We stayed at the Ariel House for four nights and were very pleased, would definitely stay here again.  All of the rooms are different,  but are furnished Victorian style.  The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are clean and modern.  It's located in Ballsbridge, a nice residential area in the Dublin suburbs.   There are several restaurants within walking distance. You could walk to City Center (probably 15 minutes), but it's a really quick trip on the DART.  The DART station is very convenient, located just a block from Ariel House.  

What sets this place apart is the outstanding service.  We arrived early in the morning from the U.S., and were served tea, coffee, and scones while our room was being prepared.  The staff helped us with dinner recommendations and reservations, made tour reservations for us, and advised us on traveling the DART.  One day we took an all day tour to Wicklow, and it was cold, wet, and windy the entire time.  When we returned to the hotel, we did not feel like going back out for dinner.  Yanna helped us order pizza for delivery, and then set up a table in the dining room so we could enjoy our meal.   There aren't many places that offer this level of attention!   The entire staff is warm and welcoming.

The breakfasts are wonderful, fresh and something for everyone.  There's also a pleasant old fashioned drawing room, with newspapers and an honesty bar in the evenings.  Stay here--you will be comfortable!!

Also, it's a fun day trip to take the DART to Dun Laoghaire and several of the towns south of Dublin.  We did this one day when the weather was spectacular, and really enjoyed the scenery and just walking around the towns.",5,2011,08,28
233,Will definitely be back,"I have stayed in many big hotels here and abroad and was hesitant about staying in a boutique like hotel such as this but the personal touch and warm welcome was so refreshing.  I have only positive things to say, the dart is right beside hotel so going into town or anywhere along the dart line is made so easy.  We were able to walk to Roly's Restaurant in Ballsbridge (10mins away) for a fabulous meal that evening.  The breakfast was delicious, everything freshly cooked and a great choice, you will definitely be full for the day.  We were tired on arrival and we received a lovely tray of tea and fresh scones to revive us.  When I asked how much I was told it was complimentary -  nice touch !  Beds very comfortable and bathroom with all the necessities.  A good mix of the old with the new without compromising your desired comforts.  Cant wait to go again.",5,2011,08,25
233,We loved it. A great place to stay.,"We were travelling with our 14 year old daughter and we wanted her to see what a Bed and Breakfast was. We could not have picked a better one. Breakfast was excellent and the rooms, very cozy. The people at Ariel House are incredibly helpful and nice. Our airline could not find our luggage and they assisted us with the calls and stuff. They even had the nice touch to call us on the cell phone to let us know the last of the suitcases had arrived so that we could enjoy our day, which we certainly did after that!!
They also helped us with other reservations as we wanted to see a traditional Irish music show.  We went to the Ploughboy Pub (which is a worthwhile experience, by the way) .
The hotel is in a quiet  area, far from the noise in town but conveniently close. If you come by car, there is parking space. If not, it is  a pleasant walk to downtown (we went in summer) but it is also very close to a train station that takes you downtown in a few minutes. We will recommend this hotel to all our friends.",5,2011,08,23
233,Vintage charm with Modern Air,"The location was excellent, out of the centre but easily accessible by the Dart rail connection on the doorstep. Rooms were well finished off. The breakfast menu gave a wide variety but unfortunatelly we had to catch an early ferry so missed out.",4,2011,08,21
233,Beautiful and Comfortable in the nicest part of Dublin,"My family stayed for two nights at Ariel House. It is located in a very beautiful part of Dublin that is also conveniently located by a DART station. Our rooms were very nice, and quiet, and the staff was lovely. We had fabulous Irish Breakfasts both mornings. When we were late checking out because we had trouble getting back from renting our car they were very nice about it. The only thing I didn't like was all the steps and stairs, but if that doesn't bother you it was great. We would go back again.",4,2011,08,19
233,Ariel House  'checks' all the boxes - and then some.,"I’m not in the habit of writing reviews for places I stay and I am compelled to write this review.

If you are looking for a special place to stay in an excellent Dublin area, Dublin 4, check out Ariel House .  I’ve traveled to over 65 countries and over 128 cities internationally.  I’ve stayed in hotels, Beds and Breakfast of all qualities.  Ariel House has been the one that I keep coming back to in Dublin.  The place is reminiscent of calmer times, the rooms are quite comfortable with great amenities.  You really don’t have to bring a thing.  Their breakfast is top notch and reflects the overall quality of this place.  I would rate Ariel House above the “Executive Floors” of most top star hotels.  It's a place you feel at home.

There may be more glamorous, and certainly more expensive places to stay but It’s hard to find the hospitality, the general warmth of their staff,  the genuine concern for their guest’s comfort, and the value of the Ariel House accommodations.    They are located in Ballsbridge a lovely area of Dublin within a short walk to city center and near enough to the rail to walk.  If you are here for the Dublin Horse Show – it couldn’t get better.

Atmosphere – check
Comfort – check
Location – check
Amenities – check
Hospitality – check
Value – check
That ‘other’ intangible quality - check

They even took care of me when I was sick.  Seriously – what hotel would do that?
Go – enjoy your stay at Ariel House you’ll be glad you did.",5,2011,08,11
233,Excellent hotel!!,"Ariel House is a lovely friendly hotel located just outside the main hub of the city - very close to the Aviva Stadium.  The quality of our room/facilities was  excellent and spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable.  We were located on the ground floor and overlooked the rear garden which was lovely and quiet.  The breakfast is exquisite with a very extensive choice - a choice we have never seen at other hotels.  All of the staff are extremely helpful and nothing is too much trouble for them.  They all have an excellent knowledge of the local area and are more than willing to recommend/book restaurants, theatre tickets, etc.  The service and hotel is faultless.  There is a Dart station within 5 minutes walking distance.  The Aircoach to Ballsbridge takes you to within a 5-10 minute walk of the hotel and we found this to be a really easy way to get to/from the Airport.  There is a wide choice of restaurants within the area - but the only one we tried was French Paradox (French cuisine) - our meal and the service was excellent.  We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to any traveller to Dublin and we will certainly be recommending it to friends and family.  This will definitely be our choice of hotel the next time we are in Dublin.  Thank you for a very memorable stay!",5,2011,08,10
233,"""Where service is #1""","Ariel House was an absolute delight. The rooms are very spacious and the neighborhood is beautiful. The best thing about staying here is the staff. They do their best do provide you with the best possible service. Our plane arrived at 7:00 a.m. and they did their best to provide us with a room earlier than normal check-in time and invited us to enjoy their wonderful Irish breakfast until the room was ready. On top of this, since they were not fully booked at the time, they gave us a free upgrade to a nicer room. 

They also helped us with directions whenever we asked and were extremely helpful with tips on seeing the sites. One of the best ways to see the city is to avoid driving in and walk ten minutes to Merrion Square and purchase a 2 day pass for the Dublin Bus Tour. It is a double decker bus that goes around the entire city and stops at ALL the sites and you can get on and off all day long. You can purchase the tickets at Ariel House. We found this to be well worth the money  since it saved us the hassle of dealing with traffic and parking, and got a city tour to boot. 

By the time we left Ariel House my husband told them it was ""run by angels and saints."" They truly made it a great experience. 

The only negative I will mention is if you are a light sleeper ask for a room that does not face the street side, because you will hear cars go by every once in awhile. There are many rooms that face the back and then you will hear absolutely nothing, so do not let this keep you from staying at Ariel House. The quality of the bed, the service and the breakfast are excellent.",5,2011,08,09
233,Excellent B & B!,"Gorgeous Georgian building with comfortable, nicely decorated rooms and superb, made-to-order breakfasts. The staff are very kind and helpful. Lansdowne Road DART station is half a block away, making transport a breeze, and it's about 30 min walk to Grafton Street. So much nicer than staying in a cookie-cutter hotel. Highly recommended!",5,2011,08,04
233,A lovely experience,"Thank you to everyone at Aeriel House for a really lovely stay in the WB Yeats suite on Sunday 24th July. My mother who was brought up in Dublin used to recite "" I will arise now and go to Innisfree"" to me when I was young so being allocated this room brought a tear to my eye.  It did not disappoint nor did the wonderful breakfast the next morning.    I have wanted to stay at Aeriel House since I was a young lady going to the Rugby Internationals but could never afford it then, so it was lovely to fill a lifelong dream at 68 years of age.   Hopefully I will be back again soon.

Many thanks
Valerie Allen",5,2011,08,02
233,A gem tucked just outside the hustle and bustle of Dublin,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights in June 2011.  This was our first trip to Dublin and we were actually looking for something more centrally located, but we got such an outstanding deal at a room here that we couldn't pass it up.  Ariel House is a small inn located in Ballsbridge, which is a clean, leafy area just outside the central city.  It's close enough that you could walk to the city, which we did, but more convenient and quicker is the DART train that stops just a couple of blocks from the hotel.  Being a somewhat older building, our room was starting to show its age but was perfectly comfortable and clean.  Free WiFi worked just fine.  Our room was rather noisy between other guests coming and going and some renovations that appeared to be taking place, and although it did not bother us terribly you may want to bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper.  The breakfast was fantastic, though I'm not sure it would be worth the posted prices if it was not included in the room rate, which for some it was not.  And the service was great; all of our questions were answered thoroughly and professionally, and they even offered to do our laundry for us after a load of handwash we did in our room did not dry in time for us to pack it up and leave.  In short, I'd highly recommend Ariel House if you're okay with staying a bit outside the city and don't require absolute silence to sleep.  One caveat:  The hotel is located right next to the huge new Lansdowne Stadium, and I'm not sure what the vibe is on days when the stadium is hosting an event.  My guess is that it's not nearly as peaceful and quiet, so do a little research if that could bother you.",4,2011,08,01
233,A great place to stay!,"We travelled to Dublin for the Bon Jovi concerts at the RDS stadium and chose the Ariel House for its location.
We had a fantastic time and can not recommend the Ariel House Hotel and it's staff enough.  They really went out of their way to be friendly and helpful and were always on hand for advice and tips for getting to and around Dublin and the surrounding areas.  We enjoyed a visit up to the coastline thanks to their advice we took the tourist bus around Dublin, went to Dublin zoo and the Guinness Storehouse  - great memories!!
The location both to the RDS and the Aviva stadiums is excellent and the train station is just accross the road for easy access to anywhere you want to go
The breakfast is second to none here - believe all the reviews it is VERY special!!
Thanks for a great stay and all your help - It was very much appreciated",5,2011,07,29
233,Best breakfast in Dublin,Superb place - better than most Dublin hotels. Friendly and attentive staff. and without doubt the best home cooked breakfast we have experienced in years. Great place to stay.,5,2011,07,24
233,Marvelous stay and charming house!,"Me, my wife and our 6 year old daughter stayed at Ariel House for 5 wonderful nights. We were coming from a week in Lismore and after a 3 hour drive we were warmly welcomed and given a wonderful superior suite. Our daughter was very happy with a double bed all for herself! House is very clean and all the staff go out of their way to help you especially Deirdre who gave us lot of tips on places to visit. But the best thing is the breakfast and those delicious scones! Ariel House is only 20 min walk from city centre but if its raining, DART is next door! Overall a wonderful stay and hope to stay there again.",5,2011,07,22
233,Nowhere else we would stay in Dublin,"Our short stay at Ariel House last August was one of probably half a dozen stays there over the past few years.  The fact that we will be there again later this month, and chose it as our base for the whole family when celebrating my parents' 50th wedding anniversary in February, probably tells you all you need to know.  We always get a warm welcome, particularly from Deirdre and the girls at breakfast who make a fuss of the kids, the breakfast itself - and afternoon tea - are superb, dining room and lounge comfortable, the family rooms we've had are spacious and homely (and much improved since refurbishment).  The location is good - quiet, leafy part of Dublin - with the DART at the end of the road, a ten minute run into town.  The hotel is set in a grand Victorian house (well, two joined), typical of the area.  I am originally from Dublin and Ariel House really is a home from home.  Recommended.",5,2011,07,14
233,Comfy bed,"I booked this place because it looked charming in the photos.  Our room was very nice with an especially comfy bed which we really needed after a long flight.  Deirdre welcomed us and gave suggestions on a bus tour which we used.  It was great because she had the tickets right there.  Breakfast was very nice with all the usual Irish fare and plenty of it!  Our only complaint is that the parking isn't as readily available as they state.  There was a lot of car moving just to get everyone who had a car, parked.  It was a bit off the beaten track if Dublin is what you want to see, but if you don't mind walking...",4,2011,07,08
233,"Fantastic place, we always stay here....","I live in Wicklow and any time I stay in Dublin, I stay at Ariel House...as I was about to write, I noticed a review a few down and I completely disagree. I find the rooms alwasy spotless any time I stay, the staff are very friendly and helpful and most of all I find the breakfast always to be excellent - really yummy, especially the eggs with bacon and tomato relish and the salmon with the lovely creamy sauce (can't remember name exactly) - so thumbs up and thank you to Ariel House from me and my friends!",5,2011,07,07
233,Great value,An older property but perfect for a value for money getaway. Ask for a room overlooking the garden. Right next door to Landsdowne Rd. A bit out if town (circa eru10 taxi) but very close to the dart. Breakfast included.,4,2011,07,07
233,Charming and Comfortable B&B,"We spent two days at Ariel House and thoroughly enjoyed.  Ariel House's location in Dublin is excellent and is a short walk to a variety of good dining establishments.  We found the staff at Ariel House to be kind, friendly and helpful and always available to answer questions.  The building is charming, decorated with interesting antiques using lovely rich color accents.  Our room was so comfortable and clean.  The bathroom was quite large with what looked like new fixtures and tiles - great water pressure and temperature for bathing.  The dining room was lovely, bright and with comfortable seating, with very efficient and pleasant staff.  The menu for breakfast was extensive, interesting and had very healthy food options.  What we ended up ordering was delicious.  Ariel House's breakfast hours are quite extensive so one has the option of an early or a later dining time - plus they offer a lunch/tea menu at a good price if one is interested.  We did not take advantage of that as we were busy all day enjoying traveling around Dublin.  For the two days we were in Dublin we were able to safely park our car in the provided parking spot directly in front of the building.  We would definitely recommend Ariel House as a reliable and affordable place to stay - if we return to Dublin for another vacation we would look forward to staying at Ariel House again.",5,2011,07,05
233,What a massive disappointment...,"We were very disappointed with this guesthouse. We booked and paid for  a ""superior"" room but ended up in a dark, dirty room in the basement. There was no light hanging from the ceiling just two lamps, we were practically in darkness! The bathroom was  a disgrace, mould all over the ceiling and dangerous exposed wires over the mirror. The bath also had dirt in both corners. Also, there was dust on the bedside locker and lamp and I couldn't see myself in the mirrors they were so dirty!

Unfortunately there was no other rooms available as Bon Jovi were in town so we had to put up with it...

Also, we thought breakfast was included in the price but then found out it wasn't so make sure to check this before you book. I guess breakfast was the only good point but we paid dearly for it.

My advice is not tot stay here, we thought we were booking 2 nights in a lovely guesthouse and what we got was disgraceful for the price. I'd look elsewhere there is far better value to be had",1,2011,07,04
233,Fantastic - all around a great place,"Stayed here on a family trip - traveling with 5 people and we had the family room. Plenty of room, though the pull out sofa bed was a bit hard (but to be expected for a bed). 

Don't let location fool you - about a 25 minute walk into central Dublin, 15 min to the hop on hop off bus stop #5, and 1 minute to the tram into the center. So all round good, but also a bit outside the centre in a quiet residential area if seeing that side of Dublin is what you are looking for. The walk in passes along the canals, etc. which is a nice walk. 

The service here is fantastic and the two ladies who are there most of the time...the manageress (who appears to have one an Irish service award!) and Egle are spectacular and provide a level of service that is superior. Very helpful and polite - true Irish hospitality. 

Breakfast was amazing, including the home made bread - a must have. I would recommend this place to anyone and will be returning myself!",5,2011,07,01
233,One the best hotels in Dublin,"I booked two rooms for my sister who was home from abroad for a family gathering, grandaughter and myself. On arriving at the hotel we were met by a very friendly receptionist who informed us that they were on 24 hour call if we needed anything. We entered old world meets modern in our beautiful  bedroom. The hotel is situated five minutes walk from the train station which travels from the north to the south side of Dublin's wonderful coastline and to the city center. We travelled to Dublin city on the dart and shopped till we dropped arriving back to the hotel late all we wanted was a comfortable nights sleep. After having one of the best sleeps in a long  time we woke up famished. On entering the breakfast room we were greeted by friendly staff the food was excellent offering a great selection on the breakfast menu. They also provided a buffet with cereals, cakes and fruit juices. Overall the experience was great I would recommended this hotel to anyone looking for good food, high standards of cleanliness and comfort and friendly staff.",5,2011,06,28
233,The Best Small Hotel in Dublin,"Ariel House was referred by an native of Ireland now living in Canada...he put his country on the line and Ariel House did not disappoint. We stayed for two nights at the front end of our trip and came back for three more at the end....it was like coming home!!!
The location is super, local restaurants but yet only a bus ride/walk to the centre of Dublin. It has a wonderful old Georgina facade in a friendly tree lined neighbour hood. The Bus from the Airport drops you off one block away, a taxi will take you to the car rental agency for a very reasonable sum, and did I tell you about breakfast in the solarium.????..Menu choices, wonderful service and ambience galore!...the warm welcome, the assist with accommodation  elsewhere in Ireland, the booking of theatre tickets, the advice on what to see was all appreciated....can't say enough about this wonderful  spot...and the price is right for those who have to be realistic about their travel dollar. If you are special and ask nicely you may get a grand room with the four poster bed and bay window....the bathrooms are fantastic as well!
All in all our Irish friend recommended the best place to stay in Dublin, bar none!",5,2011,06,26
233,Not so good,"Basement Room, Dangerous and moldy Bathtub, Dark room, Not worth it!  There are very few parking spots also.  The breakfast was very good.",2,2011,06,25
233,Great Stay,"We had a great stay at the Ariel Guest house. By circumstance and poor planning we could only stay one night, but if I return to Dublin, I will look to them first. Easy access to airport by bus or light rail, easy access to Dublin by DART train, affordable rooms, and great breakfasts. Many guidebooks say avoid a rental car in Dublin and I agree. If you HAVE to rent a car, start or end your trip here with their free parking. Or, you can easily get to downtown by the light rail DART train. 
-Yanna was great, very helpful and friendly. 
-Comfortable rooms, great breakfasts. We would definitely stay again!",4,2011,06,24
233,Excellent little house in a city I didn't like at all...,"Although I didn't like Dublin at all, if you go there, Ariel House is an excellent place to stay. Starting from a very helpful reception staff, great breakfast, and a very clean and comfy room, I loved everything about it. I had a Mews room which I liked very much because of the peace and quiet and a great view on the greenery in the courtyard. And Dublin, well, in my view an overpriced car-orientated city with nice enough architecture but that's about it. If it ever sees me again, I will definitely go back to Ariel house though.",5,2011,06,23
233,Brilliant!,"This place is lovely. Beautiful old house that is literally 30 seconds away from a DART station. I noticed other reviews saying it was a bit far from Dublin centre but I really didn't think so. Hop on a train and you will be there in minutes. V safe area also.

On arrival we were given coffee/tea and lovely bread and pastries whilst we waited for our room. I add that we had arrived early and didn't expect our room to be ready. Nice treat and just a special touch that you don't get in many places I feel. Staff are all very pleasant and helpful. Room itself was large and bathroom modern and clean. Nice view of the Aviva stadium too!

Breakfast is absolutely perfect! And the setting in a lovely sunroom is great!

We only stayed for one night but will return on future visits to Dublin.",5,2011,06,23
233,Without a doubt-would stay here again!!,"Our stay at Ariel House was FANTASTIC!  What a great start to our 8 day Ireland holiday. After a long trans-Atlantic flight we could not have asked for a better welcome. Sleep deprived, we parked our hired car in Ariel House's lot and intended to take the train (station is just a few houses away) to the city centre to use up 6 hours before our scheduled check in time. That early morning the staff offered us an immediate early check in without us even asasking. What a nice surprise. Ariel House is clean, the breakfast is delicious, and the staff is kind and warm. Do not miss the chance to stay here. You will not be disappointed!! Thank you Ariel House.",5,2011,06,21
233,great staff,the staff was very helpful and accomodating.the location was a little to far from the center of dublin.,3,2011,06,20
233,A delightful way to start our trip!,"The Ariel House was a wonderful place to start a 10 day trip in Europe.  We arrived in Dublin very early in the morning and when we arrived at Ariel House our room was not ready.  However, we were greeted warmly, offered breakfast and a place to stow our luggage.  Breakfast was very good and the little breakfast room was charming.  After breakfast, we took a lovely walk as the neighborhood and surrounding area is very pleasant and safe.  When we returned, our room was ready and luggage had been taken to our room.  The room itself was small for a family of 4 but adequate for our needs.  We spent little time in the room so this was not a concern.  The beds were comfortable and clean and the bathroom was small but clean also.  Ariel House is located a short walk from the DART train station which will get you right into the middle of town.  It's also a short walk or train ride to a hop on/hop off bus stop which I highly recommend.  
The front desk was knowledgeable and gave us great recommendations and directions.  Our last morning there, the breakfast room was full so we had to wait a few minutes in the lounge---and we were served coffee while we waited!  
I would recommend this place to anyone that wants a reasonably priced, clean place to stay in a great location in the city.",5,2011,06,20
233,Great service,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights after touring Ireland. The hotel is very comfortable and our room was large and had all the facilities we wanted. The service form the staff was very good, with a special mention for the lady on reception (who I think was the manager). She seemed to work long hours (occasionally helping in the restaurant at breakfast time) but was always cheerful. The breakfast was good. The only slight disadvantage is that it is a 20 minute walk into the town centre. Not too much of an issue for us but might be for some. Having said that, the location is in a pleasant area of town (and close to the Lansdowne Road stadium for sports fans). One night we ate at Rolys Bistro (just a 5 minute walk away in Ballsbridge) and the food and service were excellent..",5,2011,06,20
233,Great people and very special breakfast,"My wife and I and our daughter and son-in-law stayed at Ariel House for two nights earlier this month and we all found the experience most comfortable and pleasant. 

The breakfasts were particularly freshly prepared and served by the frienliest of staff.  All in all a great experience staying at Ariel House.  Well done to Deirdre and her team.

233,Our stay at Ariel House was outstanding!!,"Usually superlatives of the highest praise for hospitality are reserved for family and dear friends. After staying at Ariel House this past Easter and early May, Ariel House and its staff are ‘family’ - or at the very least among among our closest and dearest friends. We stayed there before and after a ten day driving trip around Ireland. We had a most enjoyable stay! From the outset we received the warmest welcome. Arriving early in the morning after a long trans Atlantic flight, our room was ready and we were invited to have breakfast. (Not the usual hotel reception - ‘Sorry your room will not be available until ...’ ). The rooms (before and after the drive) were clean, comfortable and unique in decor - reflecting some of the history and culture of the buildings’ era. The breakfast menu was extraordinary! There was exceptional variety and choice of hot and cold plates - appetizingly prepared and presented. A personal favorite was poached eggs and smoked salmon. All staff members were friendly, attentive and helpful. Every request or question  received their undivided attention in the most professional and competent manner - ice, directions, onward travel arrangements, recommendations for accommodation elsewhere in Ireland , bookings, etc. - all were handled quickly, competently, professionally and always with excellent outcomes. As to location, Ariel House is a few steps from the Lansdowne Road DRT Station which is but two or three stops and a few minutes from the very heart of Dublin (and onward to other locales around Dublin Bay). Alternatively, the Dublin bus service is but a few minutes in opposite direction from the DRT Station. Several restaurants and pubs in the close neighbourhood offer a variety of choices for evening meals, etc. Our stay was exceptionally pleasant - made all the more so by the staff - especially Dierdre who made us ‘so very welcome’ in every respect.

233,We found it lovely last year and came back for more,"This year we returned to stay at the ARIEL HOUSE Hotel in Lansdowne Road, Dublin. It’s a lovely Georgian style house very convenient for the DART station and with its own car park. Once again the standard of the rooms, the breakfast, and the overall service was excellent. Any minor problem or query was dealt with immediately and with a smile.
A special mention and thanks for Deidree the manager , Jana and Aga",4,2011,06,14
233,"We could have stayed much longer, but had to get home!","Ariel House is a real treasure - we would stay there again in a flash.  The neighborhood is residential and quiet, but with access to downtown Dublin.  The conservatory for breakfast was delightful, and the food was marvelous.",5,2011,06,09
233,This was the most welcoming and hospitable guesthome in Ireland.  A+,"Dublin friends reccommended Ariel House to us for our Easter trip home from the States.  From making our reservations, being warmly greeted on arrival, to a lovely and well-appointed garden guest room, through advice on how to get to where we wanted to get to in the fair city, a stupendous breakfast and easy check-out, we had a very fine time..

Deirdre sets a tone of welcome and un-hurriedness.  You are surrounded in a warm and generous feeling of kind hospitality that we thought had gone missing when we have visited this beautiful city in recent years.  Soft luxury at very reasonable rates.  We will send all of our best friends (and ourselves!) to Ariel House.  Our Good Luck.  Yours, too.",5,2011,06,06
233,Great stay,"Nice rooms, good breakfast, excellent staff.  Nice location although it is quite a walk to the centre (especially if you have been walking around all weekend!)  Buses and DART are very close by.  TIP: ask staff for a take out breakfast if you are leaving too early to have breakfast!",5,2011,06,05
233,"Wanted to like it, but the details let me down","This was a great location with nice staff, but I think it is more suited to groups or families traveling together than if you are a couple. 

We were greeted with coffee and banana bread, the staff was helpful with directions, and we thought we might come back. Our excitement waned the second we saw our room. The room was large, however, the cobwebs, broken lamp leaning against the wall, and bathroom with mold on the shower door that was falling apart wasn't so appealing. I knew the bathroom would be small, no shocker there, but I've had softer towels in communist Russia, and there seemed to be some plumbing issues both with the shower and sink. I couldn't even get cold water to come out of the shower on the 2nd day. 

We were put next to the dining room, which didn't seem to be a problem, until we were woken up every morning in the wee hours to the clattering of dishes as things were being set up. We asked for another room  -- the bed was rather cramped for 2 people -- but were told that because it had been booked through Expedia we only could get a double (I didn't see this stated on expedia, obviously). Again, this would probably be ideal if you are traveling in a group or with your family and want the whole quaint B&B experience, but for a couple trying to celebrate their 10 year anniversary, we were disappointed. I was rather glad to leave.",3,2011,05,31
233,Away from the Mayhem,"A lot of people consider this hotel to be ""way out there"" in regards to distance from the city centre. Honestly, it's a 23 min walk to St. Stephen's Green, less than 10 min DART ride to Connolly Station. There you can connect to almost anywhere in Dublin; including Belfast and Galway. Extremely quiet hotel and neighborhood. But, 10 min walk from Merron Road pubs where you can join the rowdy crowds durin rugby and futbol matches. Also 10 mins walk from a 24 hour Spar and eateries. The hotel is beautiful inside, clean, and more importantly...homey. If your home was an intimate Georgian, I wish. Delicious breakfast downstairs; cereals, brown bread, scones, Irish breakfast, eggs, bacon for 11 euros. The description said there were shared bathrooms, but I had a private bathroom. Clean, no mold, no smells. There was a television in my room! Look, just stay here. You won't regret it. The clerks are lovely, like everyone in Dublin.",5,2011,05,29
233,"Quiet location, car parking","This place was very clean, quiet, and parking available. The staff was really short with you. The beds weren't the most comfortable, but the cleaning services were great. Nice size rooms with nice size windows and high ceilings.",4,2011,05,24
233,Excellent,"Visited with my 2 sons and one of their girlfriends
Very nice hotel, clean well presented, polite staff.
Excellent sleep quality and excellent price
No good if you are looking for corporate image but I would reccommend 150%
Excellent Breakfast",5,2011,05,19
233,Just Lovely,"Five of us stayed at Ariel House for one night before a tour and two nights after. While the rooms are a little dated, they are extremely comfortable and clean. Good showers. Excellent breakfast. Most notable perhaps is the folks who work at Ariel House, Deidre and Jennie in particular. They are super nice, exceedingly helpful, responsive, and attentive. Ariel House would have been good and an excellent value, but Deirdre and Jennie elevated it to excellent--a place to be recommended. 

Also of note is that, while AH is outside of Dublin City Center, it's in a really pretty, quiet neighborhood, and about two blocks from DART train station. Dublin center is a quick 2 stops away. Kind of the best of both worlds. And there are some truly excellent restaurants, recommended by Deirdre, just a pleasant stroll away. 

All 5 of us were really happy with Ariel House and glad we chose it as our place to stay in Dublin. We would definitely do so again.",4,2011,04,28
233,"Comfortable, quiet, surprisingly central and the best breakfasts ever...","A great find which was closer to the city centre than we thought. Very convenient for the DART, which takes you straight into the city or to the seaside. Unbelievable breakfasts which keep you going all day and comfortable quiet rooms. Friendly staff whose recommendations were all spot on. Great value for money and easy to recommend.",4,2011,04,24
233,"Great location, really nice room, clean, tastefully","The place itself is very nice. The bed, softer than most in Ireland--very nice.The lobby, wonderful. The people who work there, great. The room, tastefully furnished and clean. The price, very fair: $69 EUR a night for one room. The train is just down the block and it takes you downtown in minutes. See our photos.",5,2011,04,13
233,Very cosy and with a personal touch,"We stayed for 5 nights in the ariel house. Because of water problems caused outsided the hotel (under the road in front of the hotel)we could not use the warm shower for two days. They handled this big problem for them in our case by moving us to a somewhat smaller however nice room in an other part of the hotel. Delicious breakfasts! Very, very near the DART-trainstation, from there in 5-10min tho citycenter (tarastreetstation) every 10-15min. In a nice,safe and qiuet neighbourhood.",4,2011,03,21
233,"Great Place, Convenient to Dart train and buses","The Ariel House is a lovely B&B, friendly and helpful staff. Wonderful breakfast, homemade breads and fruit preserves.  My room was nice for the time I spent there it was comfortable and warm. The Dart train is a block away which I took to Connelly station (Dublin city center), south to Graystones and north to Howth and Malihide for hikes and sightseeing. There was nothing I had issues with at the Ariel House everything was what I expected. The location of the Ariel House is convenient for the train and bus stops and an easy safe walks around the area.",5,2011,03,11
233,Great Place!,"This is one of the placest you will always think of with the most fondest memories.
Warm welcome, great rooms, very very comfy lounge and free newspapers, a delicious breakfast at convenient hours, large and clean rooms, most friendly service. Did I forget something? Yes: Have your tea served in the lounge in the afternoon. What a wonderful experience... 
We had to rebook because a flight had been cancelled. No problem whatsoever. 
If I ever go back to Dublin, I will make sure to stay at this place.",5,2011,03,09
233,An absolute gem!,"This is a great guesthouse - more like an intimate up-market small hotel. It's slightly out of the centre of town, but the bonus is that the area is very quiet. There are several excellent restaurants and bars nearby.",5,2011,03,07
233,No nonsense luxury with the best bread ever!,A lovely hotel with very warm and welcoming staff who helped make our a stay a real treat. The room was very clean and we heard no noise from any other guests for the two nights we stayed. Beds were firm and comfortable as we like like them and the bathrooms were also clean and well looked after. The real treat was the cooked breakfast and especially the home made wholemeal soda bread which was to die for...way too easy to overeat when it's that good! Defo recommend as it's also only a 10min walk to the nearest Dublin-bike station and you have to pass a couple of lovely pubs to get there! great thanks Ariel House.,5,2011,02,27
233,A Very Comfortable Guest House,"One of our first experiences in a guest house, and a very pleasant one. Very welcoming staff, a comfortable atmosphere (bedroom slippers in the lounge), and an extremely good breakfast. Rooms were a bit ""compact"", but clean and comfortable.",5,2011,02,06
233,Very Comfortable!,"We were in Dublin for Showcase Ireland Trade show and stayed at Ariel House for our entire week-long visit. The guest house is very comfortable, a little worn but very clean and the staff is excellent. Breakfasts were great, the staff is friendly. Our bed was not the most comfortable and was old like the rest of the furniture-but not bad enough to complain about. This guest house is about a 25 minute walk from Dublin's City Center and is right next to the DART station. I will definetly stay here again when I return to Dublin. GREAT value for the very reasonable cost.",4,2011,01,31
233,Top spot,"Enjoyed overnight stay with family members, very helpful & attentive staff, comfortable room, first class breakfast both quantity & quality, value for money, we will be back!",5,2011,01,23
233,"Excellent friendly staff, lovely breakfast!","Myself and my wife and 2 friends stayed here for 2 nights for New Years Eve. I phoned in advance to find out the best way to get to the B&B from the airport and they suggested a taxi for the 4 of us which was by far easier than getting any bus into town then back out.

The location is good, close to the DART which took us into the centre of town in about 10 minutes, walking to the river took about 25/30 minutes.

We stayed during the water crisis and even though the water was turned off, the staff did everything they could to supply bottled water, and even gave us a complimentary breakfast (which we hadnt booked) which was absolutely fantastic. Champagne and full Irish breakfast. What more could one ask for!

Great B&B with excellent staff, would definately return if I came back to Dublin!",5,2011,01,05
233,Great Hotel Great Location!,"We spent 4 nights in early December at the Ariel Hotel. Our visit coincided with snow / icy conditions. Despite the weather, the hotel was warm, and extremely comfortable.
Unlike most modern hotel chains (where every room in every city looks much the same), here the rooms have real period character, with solid furnishings, including plenty of comfortable seating.  
We booked through Expedia on a room only basis (breakfast could be purchased if wanted for Euro 11 each per day). All the usual amenities are however included in the room price.
In terms of location, the hotel is a minute's walk from Lansdown Road DASH (local rail) station, and within a few minutes walk of a bus route (4 and 7 are the main routes), giving access direct to both the city centre and to southern coastal toawns (including the ferry port at Dun Laoghaire).
Staff are friendly and extermely helpful (e.g. organised a visit to the nearby Aviva stadium).",4,2010,12,31
233,Excellent service !,"Stayed for the first time and was very impressed. Warmly welcomed on arrival. Quiet location. Very convenient to Aviva Stadium. Rooms were beautifully furnished in keeping with the property. Very comfortable bed. Bathroom was small but perfectly adequate. Lots of towels,complimentary toiletries,hairdryer,ironboard,tea/coffee,biscuits ,free wi fi etc.
Everything you would need for a comfortable stay. The atmosphere in the house is very relaxed and friendly. Sitting room complete with baby-grand piano,christmas tree , complimentary newspaper etc was very relaxing. Service at breakfast was attentive. Really enjoyed the porridge with berries. Home made breads, Full  Irish breakfast was very good.!  Would highly recommend 'Ariel House'.",5,2010,11,21
233,Very Pleased,If you like old and charming than this is a great choice. A bit of a walk but a nice walk to the center of Dublin (20 min.) but in a great posh area. Good overall value and great breakfast.,5,2010,11,19
233,"Excellent service, friendly staff, great location","During our recent trip to Ireland we stayed at the Ariel House in the city of Dublin.  This guesthouse is in a great location, close to public transportation, and a 15 minutes walk to the center of Dublin.  It is located in one of the best residential neighborhoods in Dublin but their rate was completely affordable.  The staff was absolute fantastic, very helpful and willing to provide information about the city.  The breakfast (included in the rate) consisted of a buffet and made to order dishes.  The staff was ever willing to comply with any of the changes we requested in the menu.  The food was delicious and fresh, especially their banana bread. The room had a king size bed and a sitting area, as well as a flat sreen TV, coffe and tea.  It was comfortable and roomy facing the street..   There is a train station and buses very close as well as restaurants, pubs, and other shops.  I would definitely stay again at Ariel House and would recommend it to anyone without hesitation.  And, best of all free wi-fi!
The only negative point would be its proximity to the just opened Aviva Stadium.",4,2010,11,07

233,Excellent - if only every city had an Ariel House!,"This was a trip to celebrate our wedding anniversary and Ariel House helped to make it a very memorable occasion.  Right from the start, we felt very welcome and were even provided with an upgrade to a suite!  Needless to say, the room was fabulous, with a very comfortable bed and a lovely bathroom with one of the largest baths we've ever seen.  Breakfasts provided a great start to the day and there were some wonderful choices for those of us who might not want 'the full Irish'.  It's a 20 min walk from Dublin city centre but all the quieter for that and handy for the DART if needed.  Ballsbridge is pleasant area and there are some good places to eat out close by should you not want to travel too far in the evening. We would definitely recommend Ariel House.",5,2010,10,28
233,"great, characteristic hotel with excellent, friendly service","We really enjoyed our stay. We had a very nice and big family room for just the two of us.  
The breakfast (€ 11 a person) is great.
Hotel is in a nice neighbourhood, about 25 min walking from city centre. Dart (train) station is about 150 meters on the corner of the street. Trains go about every 15 min. 
Various restaurants are only a few minutes away on foot.

The room was large and plenty big enough for the 3 of us and the beds were really comfortable.
The hotel is in a really nice area and only a 10 euro taxi ride from the centre.
Breakfast was really fantastic, so much choice and sets you up for the day.",5,2010,10,06
233,Beyond our wildest dreams,"The day we landed in Dublin there had been a freak blizzard which paralyzed everything.  Our cabbie said the day before it was taking 4 hours to drive the 45 minute drive in from the airport!  But any worries died away when we got to Ariel House.  I had pretty high expectations, but the actuality was even better.  It is a stunning, historical home, filled with gorgeous antiques and velvet curtains/sofas.  We were in the William Butler Yeats room, which was the size of a suite, and contained a tall antique armoire, marble fireplace, window alcove with tall draped windows, and wingback armchairs , and finally a plush canopied bed.  The bathroom was also roomy, modern and spotless.  Amazing.  On further exploration, we saw that the sitting room was similarly elegant. The piece de resistance was the breakfast room which was gorgeous. Gracious waitresses served us from a full breakfast menu, and the breakfasts came with the room!  Because of the snow situation, I had to call from London and say that if the planes flew we'd be there, but if not, I would be unable to give them the required 24 hour concellation notice.  The were so understanding and said do not worry about a thing.  They continued to be that gracious throughout our two night stay. I cannot give enough stars to this establishment.",5,2010,09,28
233,Perfect place for perfect trip,"Stayed there 4 nights and it was great.  Nice sized room with private bath.  Good location, away from noise but close to city. 1/2 block from DART but only a 15 minute walk to St. Stephen's Green.  Rooms clean and bright.  Breakfast awesome!  Wonderful variety!  Great vegetarian fare available for my god-daughter.  Beautiful breakfast room with glass ceiling.  Order afternoon tea and scones!  To die for!  Someone at the desk at all times for questions.  Did a large bag of laundry for only 10 Euro.",5,2010,09,27
233,Wonderful breakfast and very convenient to DART.  A very good bargain.,My favorite parts of Ariel are the breakfast solarium and breakfast.  The choices at breakfast are delicious and the setting is a great place to start the day.  Unfortunately our room was dark and oddly shaped.  We spent most of our time walking around Dublin so didn't spend much time in the room but something warmer or cheerier suits me better.,3,2010,09,06
233,"Lovely friendly hotel, helpful staff, excellent rooms and breakfast to die for!!","We stayed 2 nights at this hotel on a tour of Ireland- by far the best!!. There was a welcoming atmosphere as soon as we entered the hotel, which was beautifully decorated in a victorian stlye with a lovely drawing room.  We took the tour which was offered as part of the package which saved us some money.  The room was a large family room, lovely, clean and plenty of room we had 2 double beds, sofa (bed- didnot use) and comfy chairs.  Tea and coffee facilities good and complimentry wash products of good quailty.  The hotel is about 20 min  steady walk  into St Stephens Green where you can catch tour bus and bar streets.  What was really  impressive was breakfast!! excellent choice including a range of cearals, etc Award winning porridge and choice of hot irish breakfast, french toast with creme fraiche and berries- wonderful such a range and very high quality, attentive service throughout.  The children were well catered for with choice of food etc.  Will definately be visiting again and would recommend this to friends and family.",5,2010,08,24
233,Nice place to stay,Stayed there for 1 night. Found the room to be clean and spacious. Breakfast was superb. Freshly squeezed orange juice and a great selection of food on offer.,5,2010,08,22
233,Everything we could possibly want in a Hotel.,"This is lovely hotel, which provides a more personal experience.  Each morning they provided a breakfast with so much food of any and every variety.  The scones were the best we had on the whole trip.  The hotel is in an afluent part of Dublin and  is within a 15 minute walk of; St. Stephen's Green park & Grafton Street (Shopping).  If you prefer to take the intracity train.  The station is only a short walk away.  We will definitely being staying at this hotel on our next trip.",4,2010,08,18
233,I found HEAVEN at Ariel House,"The quick version of this review would be: forget about everything else, choose Ariel House. 

It's absolutely perfect. Great staff, great rooms, perfect location with easy access to the DART station (brings you to the City Centre within a few minutes) and perfect breakfast. We got offered tea and biscuits in the afternoon, and even got a little bag with fresh scones with jam when we were about to take the train to Belfast. Little things like this makes you feel special, you're not just ""a tourist"" or a random guest. 

I have nothing negative to say about this place. It's truly heaven.",5,2010,07,30
233,Fantastic service and location!,"Ariel house has really extraordinarily courteous and helpful staff. They were always pleasant, helped me organize my departure by taxi, arranged a packed breakfast for me when I left the hotel before standard breakfast hours. They also offered help arranging tours and picking sights and restaurants (though I didn't take advantage of this so can't comment). The hostess seemed a bit harried during busy breakfast hours but was still always very nice.

Breakfast is also delicious and has a great atmosphere, with the dining room in a bright sunroom. After a filling breakfast, you are ready for a full day of sightseeing - the DART station is right down the street and the walk into town is not too bad, actually quite close to Merrion Square and that area.

A few downsides: the building is a bit old, like most in the city. Living downstairs meant there was a bit of creaking whenever people moved around upstairs. I could also tell that my bathroom had recently been redone, with new tile in the bathroom. The shower head and door were a bit old looking, slightly rusty and dirty. Nevertheless, I always felt comfortable using the facilities and in my bedroom. I was a bit sensitive to dust the first day but I have very sensitive allergies. 

Overall, I would say I had an extremely pleasant stay. The staff makes up for any downsides with their great attitudes (and there's nothing they can do about the age of the building). As a student, I found it a bit expensive, I would say most customers are older couples or families, but I gather that hotels tend to be quite expensive in Dublin.",4,2010,07,24
233,Good value and good location,"Stayed at Ariel House with girlfriend for 4 days in July. 

Staff were friendly, the breakfast (except on one day when they seemed a little overwhelmed) was excellent and freshly cooked to order. The scones easily passed my girlfriend's stringent requirements!

Lounge looked very nice although we never saw anybody sat in there.

Only slight disappointment was the room and this was partly my fault. I asked for a ground floor room but it didn't click that the reception is on the first (in the UK/Irish sense rather than USA) floor so you had to travel up to reception and then down to the room which was effectively in the basement, rather dark and effectively doubled the number of stairs and didn't reduce the number. I'm sure they would have moved me if I'd asked but I didn't want to make a fuss.  Had a peep into another room on reception level and it was certainly much lighter.

Ballsbridge is a fine area of the city and the DART (suburban rail) is only 3 minutes away. It takes you right into the city centre. You can also walk it in 25 minutes. There are plenty of good restaurants within 10 minutes walk. We also liked Herbert Park (a little quieter than those in the centre)

Would recommend Ariel House if you want good value convenience and a good breakfast.",4,2010,07,24
233,Very Nice Hotel for Pleasure Trip to Dublin,"We stayed four nights at the Ariel House this week and enjoyed it very much. The room we had was spacious with very high ceilings, nicely furnished with period furniture. The service was very good at the hotel and the breakfast was excellent, a real highlight.  The fact that the Dart station is less than a block away made it very easy to get in and out of town. We used the free wifi several times a day and it worked pretty well with occasional slowdowns. The signal in our room was good most of the time.

 We did have two complaints. Our room was quite warm and the window barely opens. I'm sure most of the year there is no need for AC but the windows should open more for these warmer times. I was barely comfortable at night with the temperature of the room even though the air outside was quite cool in the evenings. The upstairs hall was also very warm and stuffy. The bathtub and sink seemed to have plenty of hot water but unfortunately that didn't translate to the shower. We never could get a shower that was any more than lukewarm.

Altogether, those two points aside, we really liked the Ariel House and would happily recommend it as a great little place to stay in Dublin.",4,2010,07,02
233,Fantastic place for romantic getaway,"My wife and I traveled across Ireland for 10 days, and we ended our trip at the Ariel House on the night of our anniversary.  The concierge was a wonderful help in making our night special.  He booked us in a great room (luxurious bathroom, especially as compared to the numerous B&Bs we had stayed in), antique furniture, canopy bed.  Then he had fresh flowers, irish chocolates and champagne waiting for us.  Finally, he made arrangements at a GREAT restaurant within walking distance.  What a spectacular evening.  And, breakfast the next morning was in a quaint dining area, with huge windows out into their garden.  The price was not bad either, especially given all that it included.  I highly recommend staying here.",5,2010,06,19
233,Good..but coud've been better!,"After reading good reviews, I decided on Ariel's house. It is a nice place--Solarium for breakfast was lovely! Stayed for 2 nights with my daughter. It is beside the Dart station--so travel was so convenient.  Room was big, bed comfy--but we could've used better lighting. 2 lamps with black shades wasn't ideal for such a big room with high ceiling. Also, a lift could have made this place perfect. After a 24 hr. flight, we arrived at the Ariel house only to find that we had to carry our 2 big luggages up the front (, at least 16) stone steps, and up  another 20 steps to the 2nd floor. And then down again on our departure date. But on departure date, we received such a nice gesture from a lady--didn't get her name though. She wrapped a couple of scones for us after we told her we were driving up to the North. Nice indeed!",3,2010,06,17
233,Wonderful room,"We stayed at this hotel for three nights and we found the rooms very comfortable. The reason we say rooms is that we had to move rooms due to the shower not working in the first room on the second morning  and unfortunately because it was a Sunday there was no maintanance available so the only option was moving rooms. 
When we arrived it was quite late at night but we were greeted warmly and allocated our room immediately  which was very welcome. The very large room was at the front of the hotel with two big windows and a huge and extreemly  comfortable bed.  There were tea and coffee facilities available but unfortunately no buicuits.
Next morning breakfast was served in a very light and airy breakfast room with plenty of choice from a buffet table and also a good choice of cooked breakfast available to order.
The hotel is very conveniently placed next to the DART station which is the best way to travel into the heart of Dublin city and the trains run until around 11.30p.m so a night out in the city is possible.",5,2010,06,13
233,"wonderful first experience in dublin,s ariel guest house","I recently spent 4 nights in Dublin. It was the first time that I had visited Ireland so I relied on 'Tripadvisor' for useful advice. I wanted a good value but comfortable place to stay that was not in the City Centre but not too far out and convenient for the DART.
After looking for a couple of days at all the possibilities I settled on Ariel House, hoping that I'd made a good choice as you can't be certain until you actually get there. When I phoned to make a booking a very pleasant and helpful voice answered, who returned my call as they were busy at the time taking another booking.
I have only good things to say about Ariel House in Lansdowne Road, the room was very good with period furniture which I prefer to modern although Agnes did show me the rooms in the annex which are more modern in their style. The staff at Reception, Deirdre the manageress, Jenny and Agnes were exceptional no request was too much for them.
The breakfast was very good with a good range to choose from; I particularly appreciated the carafe of water with mint leaves and slices of orange which I thought was a lovely touch. I also recommend the 5 o'clock tea which is good value and convenient if you skipped lunch or had too much and want to stay in for the rest of the evening.
After a busy day sightseeing and shopping in the busy centre of Dublin I loved the feeling of coming back to Lansdowne Road with its trees and genteel Victorian houses
Hope to be back next year",4,2010,06,13
233,outstanding facility,"Spent three wonderful days staying at the ariel house. Never  expected such a warm welcome- providing  us coffee, tea and cookies in the drawing room while they prepared our room. Rooms very large and spacious. Extremely quiet. Bathroom very clean as was our room and the entire facility. Top marks to the entire staff-  very friendly, very helpful. Would stay here again just because of the people working at this hotel. Seemed more like staying with a close family member. This is not a corporate type chain hotel and we are very thankful it was not.",5,2010,06,11
233,"Great place, great location, great staff","Just returned from Dublin and stayed at Ariel House for 3 nights. Staff was extremely helpful, food was excellent, room was clean and big. Great location - right by DART and restaurants. One MINOR problem, stayed in basement and room was stuffy and warm.",5,2010,06,09
233,"Lovely, comfortable, yummy breakfast","Had a very enjoyable stay, a nice way to start off our honeymoon in Europe.  We dealt mostly with Deirdre who was Manager and  she was lovely, very helpful, accommodating, she also recommended a really nice hotel which we ended up staying in in Paris (later in our trip)...breakfast was super yummy, and service was very prompt and polite.  Room was clean and we were very happy as we got offered an upgrade to the junior suite for our second night...lovely!",4,2010,06,09
233,"Excellent location, beautiful hotel and best breakfast","I stayed here mainly because if its location. We were going to a concert in the and the location of this hotel was ideal. All we were interested in was just a basic room for the night, however when we arrived in the Ariel, it completely exceeded all our expectations. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Bedroom was beautiful and full of character.Breakfast the following morning was super, one of the best ever. All in all it was an amazing hotel, and i would definitely recommend it (i am staying here again next week for a Paul McCartney concert).",5,2010,06,08
233,"Great location, superb service","Ariel House is a beautiful Georgian guesthouse in Dublin 4. I stayed two nights.Lovely and quiet, beautiful lobby with tea and sweet bread when I arrived. The room itself was ok  but had some problems: paint peeling from the wall, and a light that went off an on in the bathroom (this was soon fixed). What really makes Ariel stand out, however, is it's extraordinary hospitality and service. The breakfast menus is creative, and the food delicious, all served in a beautiful solarium.  It's near public transportation to and from the airport and the city centre. I walked into town both days - it's a refreshing and lovely walk. I'd definitely stay there again (but might ask for another room). All in all, an exceptional place to stay in Dublin.",4,2010,06,03
233,Great Start to our Ireland Trip,"We arrived at 7am at Ariel House. From the airport, we took the AirLink bus to Ballsbridge, and got off at the D2 Hotel (formerly the Jury's Hotel).  That was very quick and easy.  The Ariel staff were very gracious and held our bags, and allowed us to have breakfast (it was an additional charge, but we were happy to not have to find breakfast somewhere else).  We then went out to do a little reconnoitering and touring until our room was ready.  Our room was a very large one, with two double beds and a brand new bathroom.  Everything was spotless.  We both slept well and did not hear the train.  Ariel does an excellent breakfast with a lovely conservatory.  It is possible to walk downtown, which is what we did the two days we were there.  There are also some very good restaurants nearby, as well as a market.  The neighborhood is safe and you are very near the American embassy.",5,2010,04,28
233,Perfect!,"We stayed here for a concert and i genuinely couldnt say one bad word about the hotel! the room was huge with a big bathroom and the staff were lovely, very accomodating. really quiet area aswell for been in the city. the breakfast was outstandingit was so reasonably priced too....will def be staying here again on my next trip!!",5,2010,04,26
233,Excellent,"This BB is located on a quiet street and within 5 minutes walk of the American Embassy which was the sole purpose for my stay.  I requested and received an early morning call.  The room was large and very comfortable and beautifully decorated.  The bathroom was a bit small but functional.  The breakfast was everything and more that the reviews talked about from fresh fruit to a fry.   I didnt avail of the sittingroom during my visit but I could clearly see it was very cosy and well furnished.    From our window we could see the New  Rugby Stadium in the process of being completed but again I didnt hear any noise.  The Dart is just around the corner although I didnt avail of this as I took a Taxi into Dublin which cost €10, so no complaints there.  Plenty of Restaurents around the area.  I went for a walk on my own and returned to the BB at around 9.30 and I have to say I felt extremly safe.  Jennie who is the Receptionist was extremly helpfull and always had a smile.  I was able to leave my bag while I trotted off to the Embassy.    I would recommend this BB to one and all as you wont be disapointed.",5,2010,04,17
233,Quality and Service with a smile,"We have just returned from a fantastic couple of days staying at the Ariel House. I can only describe the whole experience as excellent. Checking in we were met by a lady who was extremley helpful and offered us a full cooked breakfast due to early time of our arrival. The public areas are tastefully decorated and very clean.
The breakfast is as described in all the other reviews. It was beautiful, with plenty of choice.
The bedrooms were once again extremely nice, well decorated and with comfortable beds. The hotel was close to the Dart giving easy access to the city centre.
The service was absolutely fantastic. I comment on this as on our day of departure unfortunately flights throughout the UK had been cancelled leaving us in essence stranded. Jennie the lady at reception could not have been more helpful assisting us with booking of ferries in order to help us get home. Nothing was too much trouble for her.
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit Dublin. It certainly won't be long until we return.",5,2010,04,16
233,Perfect accomodation in Dublin,"This B&B is a real deal in Dublin. It's got everything you can expect : it's cosy, quiet, service is excellent. You should not be put off by the distance from downtown. It's very much walkable and buses are round the corner.
Special mention for the amazing breakfast table, the very cosy drawing room and the peace and quiet of the area.",5,2010,04,11
233,"Wonderful (small) hotel, w/ character and amazing staff.","Reasonable room rates, plus incredibly conscientious and kind staff made our stay very enjoyable! We were put in a room beneath a staircase or something and since it is an older building (refurbed recently, so don't worry about furnishing, carpeting, bathroom etc) there was quite a bit of squeaking overhead. Staff were quick to try  to change us the next morning but we opted to stay in the same room due to the replacement room being quite a bit smaller. Instead the staff member arranged to cover the cost of our two breakfasts we indulged in during our stay! How kind and I get the feeling that this is a common thing. It didn't fix the squeaks but it is nice to see a hotel ""put their money where their mouths are"".

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to a family member or friend.

If you are walking to and from city centre Dublin allow for about 30-40 minutes. There isn't too much going on around the hotel besides a few restaurants and pubs near to the major road five minutes away, so it is quite a quiet place. The new rugby stadium is under construction so that might be trouble on game nights.

If you are coming from the airport, AirCoach stops 5 minutes away at the D4 hotel and the fare, roundtrip, is very reasonable.",5,2010,03,29
233,"Lovely guesthouse, great breakfast!","I stayed here on business recently, for its proximity to Ballsbridge, and for its very competitive room with breakfast rate.  Taking into account its free parking, free wifi and lovely breakfast, it bested any of the budget hotels.
The guesthouse is located adjacent to the Lansdowne Road DART station, also near the Aircoach bus stop in Ballsbridge, and there is a taxi rank further up the road near D4 hotels.  The room I was given was huge, with a lovely view of the garden, and it was really quiet and relaxing.  The room had flatscreen tv, tea and coffee making facilities and wifi access.  Breakfast was the best part of the stay - it's always nice to have a menu at breakfast and not just the usual ""full Irish""!  
There are steps up to and within the building as it's an old Georgian building, so it may not be suitable for people with mobility issues.  Otherwise, I would recommend it to a friend for a nice relaxing stay.",5,2010,03,23
233,"lovely hotel,excellent value, honest staff","Stayed here recently as a group of friends (5). We were having a big night out in Dublin. The place is lovely, great location right next to Lansdowne Road Dart station.We got two big treble rooms, comfortable beds,great bathrooms, good breakfast in conservatory area in morning. We got a very reasonable rate online.
The staff were friendly and professional, not that there were any problems to report anyway. A few days later I received a phone call from one to tell me that I had left valuables behind and she would post it on. How kind of her. I would definitely recommend Ariel House. We normally stay in Bewleys if we go to a concert but have now found somewhere far nicer.",5,2010,03,20
233,Friendly and Accomadating,"The Ariel H ouse was a great place to stay. It was a quick bus ride to the city, and far enough away from the tourist. The rooms were pleasant and staff very friendy and most helpful. The dining area is a sun room, and breakfast was delicous.
Our group of 4 stayed in two equally nice rooms.",4,2010,03,15
233,Perfect !,"A very good address, abounding and very good Irish breakfast, an ample and comfortable room, close to the available town centre on foot or by very close DART. Really a very good memory of Dublin. I deeply recommend this guesthouse the personnel of which is attentive and obliging.",5,2010,03,08
233,Romance and luxury hand in hand,"I would simply like to let everybody know what a beautiful place this is. The house is very special with romantic rooms that make a dream come true, the service is o so good their breakfast is super attended which offers you fresh, home made, little breads and lots of other choice. We were there the first of Januari and they even offered champagne at breakfast.
We had roomnr. 251 just take a look at the pictures in their website.

233,Absolutely fabulous and a breakfast to die for...,"We visited Ariel House for a 50th birthday treat - we had a room with a four poster bed which was beautiful. It was very well placed to walk or get the bus into Dublin. As everyone says the breakfast was lovely, a nice late start to the day and beautifully presented meal with additional extras and excellent service. It is definitely worth a visit!",5,2010,02,14
233,Truly Excellent - the reviews are true.,"We stayed for a weekend at the Ariel having never been to Dublin before. We chose the Ariel based on previous reviews. It was simply excellent.

The room and ensuite were beautifully spotlessly clean, the staff polite, cheerful and helpful, and how many places do you get 6 different choices for a cooked breakfast? We walked to most of the sights, although the Dart is about 60 seconds away if you want to take it.

The website is very good and provides all the kind of information you might need. Especially helpful was the ""how to get to us from the airport"" section.

We would thoroughly recommend the Ariel to all fellow travellers and wish to thank Deirde and her staff for a wonderful stay.

Finally if you have a few hours to spare take the Dart to Howth on the coast and go seal spotting - well worth it.

233,Simply the best.,"My wife and I and two friends have just returned from Dublin Eire, and we stayed at the Ariel House Guest House. It ranks easily with the best we have ever stayed in, the rooms were great, the location was very good, the breakfast was out of this world and I find it difficult to grade the staff as they were ""Simply the best"", nothing was too much trouble and they were willing at any time to assist the guests. I would definately return in the knowledge that we would be made very welcome. It was almost like staying with family.",5,2009,11,02
233,Excellent,"i booked a 2 night stay at this hotel as a birthday present for my dad and partner.  Since coming back they can't stop praising this hotel.  Moments away from the DART station, wonderful breakfasts, very helpful and pleasant staff.  Their room was wonderful, even got an upgrade! (thanks for that, it was a nice surprise).",4,2009,09,30
233,"Nice Rooms, Convenient Location, Good Service","The Ariel House was very good.  The rooms were spacious, and well appointed.  The staff were very helpful.  The breakfasts were very good and the service was great. The location is seconds away from the DART station, and it is a short ride to the heart of Dublin (but the trains did shut down on us one night and we had to take a taxi back).  It is a 15-20 minute walk from Merrion Square where you can pick up the Hop On-Hope Off bus for sightseeing.  Buses also run nearby from downtown.  Good restaurants are also nearby in Ballsbridge.  All in all, a very nice stay.  Parking is free but can be a chore, however.",4,2009,09,14
233,A wonderful hotel!,"Quite simply one of the best hotels we've stayed in - and certainly the best in Dublin.

Yes, as has been mentioned in a past review, there are several steps to get up to the entrance, but as the building is of the Victorian era, there is not a great deal the hotel can do about that.

However, once you are inside you are greeted with friendly, helpful staff. 

Despite our room overlooking Lansdowne Road, it was very quiet at night, and even the closeness of Dublin's light rail service (the DART) didn't bother or annoy. In fact it was a guilty pleasure each morning to sit and watch the commuters walk along Lansdowne Road from the station on their way to work when we were on holiday.

The room was wonderful, with a very large bed, as well as being large enough to have a seating area with two chairs, a settee and a table.

It was nice to know the staff were always on hand should you need anything (24-hour reception) and to be able to order by phone afternoon tea in the Drawing Room for when we got back from hitting the shops, or whatever day time activity, was a delight.

Breakfast consisted of a wide range of cereals, fruit salad, scones, soda bread and a very varied selection of cooked options. Tea or coffee and toast were also in plentiful supply and the staff did all they could to accommodate those who had to leave especially early.

We cannot think of anything that was worth commenting on here. Yes, there were two or three VERY MINOR things but these were quickly sorted out by reception when we mentioned them - and you felt no animosity for bringing these to their notice.

We will certainly go back to Ariel House Hotel when we stay in Dublin again, which I hope won't be before too long.",5,2009,09,11
233,"Lovely rooms, excellent service and a great breakfast!","Ariel House is in a quiet tree-lined road which made us very pleased we had not booked somewhere in Temple Bar! We had the best meal of our holiday at Roly's Bistro 10 mins down the road, which was recommended by the friendly lady at reception. The rooms were spacious and clean, with lovely high ceilings and large comfortable beds. They set up a room with an extra bed for our 3 teenagers to share. We enjoyed the period features of the hotel and had a lovely pre-dinner glass of wine in the drawing room.  The best thing of all was breakfast where the service was excellent and the food really delicious.",4,2009,08,11
233,Best B&B in Dublin,"good area and very comfortable room. im glad we choose this one. also a car park there. the lady in the reception was very friendly (brown pache hair)

I can higly recommend this b&b. think its unpossible to get a better one in dublin. dart was close as well. good breakfast.

although there was a car that had parked the car in front of our one, which made us a bit nervous. the reception girl sorted it out though :)

she also phoned us to tell us the way to next fuel station as we had to fuel up the car. excellent service. will definetly come again. 84€ for a room as not expensive. not for this service and the region of dublin was great. much nicer than the north part. like dublin 6. ballymun. ugh!",5,2009,07,31
233,Just Like Home!,"Me and my friend are from Ontario, Canada and stayed at the Ariel house in May 2009 for 6 nights.  We were unsure about Dublin hotels, as we had never been before, but when we got to the Ariel House we were greeted by the friendly staff and welcoming environment.  This hotel is located just outside of Dublin and 50 yards from the D.A.R.T. (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) which then will take you up and down the coast of Ireland for 5 Euros.  The rooms were very clean and the meals were delicious.  What was most important to us was the helpfulness of the staff to go above and beyond to accommodate our stay with them.  They were approachable and friendly at anytime of the day/night!!  Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a typical Irish stay.  We had nothing but a good experience at the Ariel House and we would go back anytime!!",5,2009,07,05
233,Perfection!,"My friend and I are from Canada and travelled Europe in early May of this year. This was our first time heading on out a trip like this. Lucky for us, our first stop was the Ariel House. Not only was it gorgeous, safe and clean the staff was the most wonderful group of people. The breakfast was delicious, the people were friendly and so accomdating, We found ourselves saying (many times) ""I wish we were back at the Ariel House"" as our travelling continued.
I would highly recommend the Ariel House to anyone travelling the Dublin area. It was such a memorable, wonderful experience.
Thank you!!",5,2009,06,25
233,Our home away from home - I HIGHLY recommend it!,"This is a beautiful hotel with an incredible staff! They took such great care of us and made us feel like we were the only guests they had. We had medical problems during our stay there and the staff went above and beyond the call of duty to take care of us. The price was very reasonable to us for the charm of the hotel and the amazing ""customer service,"" and we enjoyed the walk to the city. The breakfasts were wonderful! There is not one thing I could say as a precaution to future guests. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin!!!",5,2009,06,09
233,Wonderful Romantic Hotel!,"We chose this hotel as the last leg of our trip from New York via the QM2 to London and on to Dublin for our honeymoon.   We absolutely fell in love with the place as they upgraded us to the Honeymoon Suite, kept our champagne chilled, and presented such a warm welcome throughout our stay.   Our room was lovely and the staff very friendly.  The breakfast room is beautiful and the service very good.  I love the leafy, quite area of Ballsbridge yet it is so easy to jump on the DART and be nearly anywhere in minutes.  We plan on returning to the Ariel House several times,  we really love staying there!",5,2009,06,04
233,Quiet and comfortable B&B with excellent breakfasts,"Ariel House is in Ballsbridge, near Landsdowne Stadium, and just a few stops on the DART from town. I was in Dublin for a conference at Trinity College and both walked into town (about 30 minutes) and caught the DART(15-20 minutes), depending on how my feet were feeling.  I chose Ariel House because I often stay at boutique hotels and B&Bs when at conferences for a bit of relief from the chain hotel scene.  A friend had recommended it, and it had WiFi and I read on Trip Advisor that it was quieter than downtown places.   It was certainly quiet and the downstairs room I was in was spacious and comfortable.  The only downside to the room was that the WiFi didn't reach my room so I had to go upstairs to check email and download documents I had to work on.  There was a wide choice of tasty breakfasts and I worked my way through all of them over my 1 week stay.  I also had their excellent soup for dinner one night when I had work to do and needed to stay in.  
I was looking forward to playing their piano in the sitting room, but a small flood had meant this room was closed for repair, but it is probably fixed by now.  
It is a little out of town but is quiet and the rates are very reasonable.  There is an excellent restaurant nearby called Roly's which has a great set dinner menu if you get there early, or even more choice on the a la carte menu later.",4,2009,05,16
233,Overrated,"Due to a late cancellation by a coach company, I had no other option but to arrange a short break to Dublin myself. After trawling the internet and checking Trip advisor reviews, we settled on Ariel House.
Entrance to the building is viable a flight of uneven stairs, so it is not suitable for those with walking difficulties. After a less than enthusiastic welcome, we embarked to our room.
At first sight, it is nicely decorated and very clean. However, the shower was extremely poor, and the beds rock hard. Needless to say, a good night sleep was not obtained. On the plus side, it was very quiet.
Breakfast was O.K. Perhaps because of the reviews and awards Ariel House has won, I was expecting a real 'wow' factor. I found it average. However, there is a nice adjoining conservatory to sit in.
We were told it was close to the city centre. Following directions given and a map, it took us nearly an hour to reach the Viking 'Dublina' exhibition. Unless you were confident to cut through backstreets, I would not say this is that closely situated at all. In fact I wished I had booked a more central place to stay.  As Ariel House is just a B& B, we vntured out for dinner.There are some really good restaurants nearby(Cuban/Thai/Indian), but be prepared to empty your wallet (except the latter).
On the day of departure, we found someone had tried to steal our car. The car was parked on the property. Someone had attempted to break in (but failed) by drilling the lock. Thankfully they failed, but will cost £200 to repair. The receptionist did seem very concerned and contacted the Garda about it.
This was on my other half's birthday too, so to say we were peeved was an understatement. This is one of the most disappointing places I have stayed at.",2,2009,05,05
233,Lovely atmosphere here !,"I have stayed twice in Ariel House in last few months as i was attending college seminars in the area. It is a great place to stay. Feels very home like, breakfast is great and staff are very nice.. Keep up the good work.. I will be back..",5,2009,04,07
233,Perfect!!!,"We stayed at Ariel House for four nights. As there were some minor problems with the electricity in our room, we got a free upgrade after the first night. Our room was beautiful, with a comfortable bed, armchairs and a flatscreen TV.
The hotel is very well situated in a residential area, close to the city and nevertheless very calm. 
The breakfast was the highlight of our stay, undoubtedly the best we have ever had. Everything was prepared freshly, served in a bright conservatory. 
We will definitely come back!",5,2009,04,01
233,"Ariel House is a beautiful building in a perfect location, definitely recommended.","This is a beautiful victorian mansion, set on a quiet leafy road, minutes from the Lansdowne Road DART station, which is perfect for getting into the city centre and up and down the coast.  Also minutes from a bus stop.  We bought a combined Bus and DART ticket which gave us unlimited travel for 3 days.

Our four poster room was beautiful, with period furniture, including armschairs and table looking out over the leafy road.  We booked a 2-course lunch to begin our stay and it was outstanding; everything homecooked and served in a lovely conservatory dining room.  There was a great choice of breakfasts and all homecooked, fresh fruit, irish soda bread and home made banana bread and muffins - gorgeous.  We had full irish both days and it was perfect.  We also tried the afternoon tea and scones, this too was outstanding.

The staff at ariel house, especially Deirdre, were so friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough for us, giving us lots of helpful advice when we asked.   It really made such a difference to our stay which was a special birthday treat for my husband, so thank you to all of them.

Ariel House is located just far enough out of the city centre for nice peaceful surroundings and nice quiet sleep, but near enough to walk in if you want to.  Or just stroll across to the very small DART stop across the road and you're in the city in minutes.

When we come back to Dublin we will definitely stay at Ariel House again.",5,2009,03,30
233,Best Hotel in Dublin,"I have stayed in numerous hotels in Dublin in the past 2 years and this is without doubt the best I have stayed in.

The service was second to none and nothing was too much trouble. It is in the ideal location for sightseeing, business and the Lansdowne Stadium (fantastic view of the stadium from my room)

The room was immaculately clean and the furniture and fixtures were top quality. 

The breakfast menu was superb – cooked fresh to order (too many hotels provide the dreaded self help hot breakfast buffet).

I will undoubtedly stay here again and without doubt recommended to all friends and family.",5,2009,03,28
233,Perfection,"We were there for 5 nights: The managers/ concierges got our tickets for the National Concert Hall and told us how to get stand-by tickets for Peacock Theater (sold out show) which worked. Breakfast was very good, cooked per your order, don't miss it! We did have a few minor problems with the room but they were addressed effeciently and completely to our satisfaction as the staff is very responsive. They gave us walking, bus, DART and driving directions on a regular basis. Staying there made our trip most memorable.
Janet & Henry Bartosch  Memphis, TN",4,2009,03,27
233,Best Breakfast Ever,"We stayed here whilst attending The Dublin Motorbike show at the RDS.  It is literally only 10 mins walk away from the RDS in the Ballsbridge area and 2 mins to the train.  Could not fault the hotel at all, the staff fell over themselves to be helpful and reception was manned 24 hrs a day. Nothing was too  much trouble at all.  The room was large (one twin and one double bed) and warm with all the usual facilities and very nice toiletries. The breakfast was the best I have ever had in ANY hotel of any star rating across the world.  I would definatel stay here again when in Dublin",5,2009,03,12
233,Perfect! Home from home!,"We have just returned from our first trip to Ireland and our stay at Ariel House has been the icing on the cake! The hotel has a real character and charm - an air of elegance and style. 
We arrived very early on our first day (around 9 a.m.) to find that our rooms were ready and available. Indeed, we were also delighted to be offered a full Irish breakfast - very welcome since we had left our home in Nottingham at 2.30 a.m! 
The genuine warmth and friendliness of the staff makes this hotel a joy to stay in - nothing is too much trouble for them. Our rooms were very comfortable - clean and spacious. 
The hotel is well situated - being only 20 minutes walk from the centre of the city and only 2 minutes walk to the Dart station. There are some lovely restaurants/bistros just up the road and the Reception staff have a good knowledge of which ones to recommend. They are more than happy to make reservations for you.
Thanks to everyone at Ariel House for our induction to Irish hospitiality!",5,2009,02,21
233,A lovely place to stay - highly recommend it !!!,"We recently stayed at Ariel House and it was all that it lived up to!!  Situated in a nice residential area yet close the city, it offered a lovely long weekend break for my partner and I.  The hotel is cosy, spotlessly clean and our room was lovely!!  Excellent breakfast with so much choice and afternoon tea served with a smile!!  Staff were so helpful and genuinely cared about their guests.  We will recommend this hotel to our friends and hope to return again soon.",5,2009,01,28
233,Nice Loacation,"Our stay in the Hotel was overral preety good. It have done a refurbishment within the last year or so because everything looked pretty new, the carpets and tha painting on the walls. Our room was not so big although it was really nice and comfortable. The breakfast room was good and the breakfast was good as well. There was al the time someone at the reception and they were nice too. It was about a 20 minute walk to the city centre and the Dart station was within a minute footwalk also the Aircoach stop which is the public transfer from and to the airport was really close to the hotel.",5,2009,01,10
233,Great place to stay,"Great place to stay. Although we arrived early to the hotel after the international flight, they gave us our room. Although breakfast hours had ended, they fixed us breakfast anyway. The staff was more than accommodating, kind, and helpful. We would stay here again.",5,2008,10,17
233,Loved the Ariel House,The Ariel House is a beatiful B&B.  The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful.  The rooms were decorated nicely and were quite comfortable.  The breakfast was really good.  You had several things to choose from.  It is located in a beautiful part of town and is walking distance to the tram/dart station.  Highly recommend!,4,2008,10,14
233,our stay,"We stayed here for a week while attending a convention. It is a short walk to the RDS and the staff go above and beyond the call of duty to make your stay enjoyable. The front reception staff were especially accommodating and friendly. The breakfast menu was more than ample and delicious. We would highly recommend this spot- handy to all of Dublin, yet quiet for sleeping.",5,2008,09,07
233,Wonderful Place,"Deidre  McDonald, the manager of this small hotel, goes above and beyond to make your stay as comfortable as possible.

We arrived early from the airport, having been on an overnight flight, and our room was ready for us when we got there.  We had made prior arrangements for this.

The room was absolutely fantastic.  It was a large room with lots of extra space, lovely antique furniture, comfortable beds and a very nice ensuite bathroom.  There was every amenity you could imagine in the room.  There were personal size bars of fine soap, along with good quality shampoo and mineral bath liquid.  There was also a good blow dryer and even an iron and ironing board in the room.  There was also a television.

The room was very quiet and comfortable with very large curtains to block out the light which enabled us to sleep extremely well.

Room service was excellent and the food was very well prepared.

The breakfast was very good with a large selection of beautifully prepared food.  There was a buffet with fresh scones and various cereals and juices and the yogurt was wonderful.

The staff were extremely helpful and courteous and would accommodate you as best they could.  Deidre herself would come around to see how the guests were doing while they were dining or if she would see you in the hallway, she would always offer a friendly hello.

It is very close to the Dart or if you prefer to walk, it is about half an hour or so from the city centre.  We walked and took the Dart.

Overall, I could not have been more satisfied with my stay.   This will definitely be my hotel of choice for trips to Dublin.",5,2008,08,15
233,Knew Instantly we had a Gem,"We arrived for a show in Dublin & booked into Ariel House for the night. As soon as we located this house, I knew instantly we had a Gem. Its warm appearance was a draw with lovely gardens. The waft of flowers greeted us at the door. Hall interior and reception room would take your breath away. At this stage couldn't wait to see the room. Staff were very informative, polite & smiling. As the porter knew we were going to a show he kindly made a detailed street plan map for us, a lovely gesture. We found our way. Our room was so elegantly prepared with warm towels, slippers and the antique furnishings were spectacular with a 4 Poster Bed, I may add. Breakfast was beautifully cooked and served. We didn't want to leave, we loved it. Looking forward to returning. Thank you to Deirdre and all her staff.",5,2008,08,15
233,Good Stopover for Dublin,"We had a very comfortable stay for 2 nights b&b at Ariel House. On arrival we were given a room up several flights of stairs and found it too far up to carry our luggage. We were immediately offered a large lower ground floor room which was very pleasantly decorated with antique furniture. The ensuite was excellent. Breakfast :- A large menu to choose from served  in a bright interesting conservatory. Staff very pleasant and helpful. We found the hotel quiet and convenient for Dublin with hop on and hop off buses. The Dart railway was 5mins walk away and took us to the East Coast for evening meal. Excellent.

233,Lovely Georgian area of Dublin,"My friend and I had 3 nights here as our last stop in Ireland and it was great! We had a good internet rate and it was more reasonable than anything we had found closer into Dublin and in a lovely quiet area. 
We had requested a room upstairs as we had read about the basement rooms being small. We were given a room on the back of Ariel House looking out to lots of cranes and building, so we asked if they happened to have any rooms at the front of the building. They did so they were happy to let us move rooms and it was great. ( I think you might hear train noise from the back rooms, but we didn't hear much noise at all.) Our room was really spacious and beds comfy.
It was a lovely walk into the centre of Dublin and we loved all the Georgian buildings and the famous Dublin doors!
The sitting room is big and lovely and breakfast was great in conservatory. Nice fresh scones and staff very helpful. We had hired a car for our ten day trip around Ireland but didn't need the car in Dublin, but my friend had thought for us to come and stay here the night before our car needed to be returned and then we could unload our luggage and not have to worry about lugging it to the hotel the next day. This worked out great as we went straight from the airport on the bus into O'Connell St.
If you want to be close to Dublin but away from all the noise and crowds, this is a great choice.",4,2008,06,06
233,Nice but...,"My boyfriend and I have just come back from a pleasant week end in Dublin. Despite some little minors, we did enjoy our stay at the Ariel House. 

Although the hotel is not  advertised expressely as ''gay friendly'', as gay couple we did not face any trouble at the Ariel House. The staff was in fact friendly, polite and helpful. 

The hotel is very good located in the peaceful  (and safe) suburb of Ballsbridge out of the bustle of Temple Bar.  In a two  (literally) minutes walk there is a DART station.  The DART ist a city rail, which takes you to the centre in a few minutes. Check carefully the timetables tough.  Trains are not very frequent and you might even have to wait up to 20 minutes! If you like walking, as we do, you can easily reach the city centre by foot in 20/25 minutes. 

The hotel itself is a gracious, well appointed mansion house with beautiful antique furniture. 

Unfortunately we were given a room in the basement (we did not ask for a juniorsuite nor we paid for it). The room was spotlessly clean,  well decorated, with a comfortable bed, tea and coffee facilities but no mini bar.  Please note that I don't travel with LV luggage racks, but our room was definetly too small. I could hardly open my  aircraft luggage in there. A flat screen TV was placed in font of the bed. You could see both Irish and British channels, but no chance for any 'continental channel'. Alas, this is probably quite a common attitude in English speaking countries.

The bathrom again was proportioned to size of the room, with a weak shower and a locked window which could not be open. The baisin was placed under the window  and the mirror hung in the opposite wall. It was very difficult for me to shave, as I always had to turn around.

Breakfast, which was served in a nice wintergarden by a friendly and efficient staff, was excellent. You had a good selection of both warm and cold food. Unbeatable quality! Try the full Irish Breakfast and you won't need any food for the rest of the day.

I hope I won't discourage you with my negative points, we did really enjoy the Ariel House and would probably stay there again. I am just tryng to be as objective as possible in my review.  I am sure you'll love the Ariel House, but please make sure they give you a room upstairs.",2,2008,05,05
233,lots of pros,"we stayed here for 3 nights along with 2 friends and we were lucky enough to get the room on the top floor overlooking the main entrance, which had 2 massive windows, a double and a single bed, with very extravagant bedspreads and headboards. the bathroom was medium sized and the water pressure in the shower was not great. the room itself was massive and very comfortable! our friends however got one of the basement rooms which although clean and comfy, was a lot smaller without the extra ""indulgences"", not sure how w were so lucky, their room was more of your standard hotel room type.

when they arrived there were no teacups in their room but after apologising profusely and bringing the teacups to their room, the staff also gave them some irish chocolates to apologise!

we checked in at 9:15 am, which was not a problem and promptly treated ourselves to breakfast, not sure if we were allowed to or not but the staff did not seem to mind and we were not charged for it. the breakfast was my favorite part, lots of choice and the warm breakfasts made to order were really good! i had a hard choice every day. my favorite was the french toast with streaky bacon and maple syrup!

the one problem was that on our last day they ran out of bowls for cereal and teaspoons? how do you run out of something so basic i am not sure? the restaurant can only fit about 30 people so they dont need that many bowls, on top of that on the last day the french toast with streaky bacon was actually french bread made into french toast with 1 piece of plain bacon...? and was not a good as the first time i had it. not sure what the problem was, maybe they ran out of bread?

those are small issues though, i would definately stay there again, was a 10min bus ride into town, buses come fairly frequently and there is a cab ""stop"" close to the hotel in case.",4,2008,03,25
233,"Super hotel, staff, and food","We have just returned from a weekend at the Ariel House in Dublin. We found the hotel on the internet and what a gem! We flew out early on the Friday and were at the hotel by 10.30am. Upon arival we were asked to take a seat in the lounge and after 5 mins we were told our room was ready - superb. 

The room was very nice, the bed so comfortable you want to take it home. Nice bathroom, with a good power shower. Breakfast is superb - a choice of a main warm course to go with the various cereals, yoghurts etc, and as much tea/coffee and toast as you wish. The breakfast room is in a nice conservatory area which is a bit small and can fill up, but you can then take a coffee etc into the lounge and await your table which doesnt take long due to their efficiency. Dont worry about rushing down for breakfast - they wont clear you out at 10.00am - they were still refilling the table at 9.55am both days to ensure that everyone had enough choice, and then they let you relax until you were finished.

Getting there is easy - the Airbus goes from the Airport every 10-15 mins and takes approx 1 hour. It costs €7 one way / €12 return, and stops at the top of Lansdowne Road outside the former Jury's Ballsbridge hotel - 5 mins walk away. Buses also go into town from here every 10mins and cost €1.50. Taxis cost about €10-14 from the centre back to the hotel. The Dart Station is only 200 metres away. Otherwise, it is a nice 30 min walk into town - a bit longer if you deviate past St Stephens Green.

A very cosy hotel in a nice area. Perfect for a romantic or similar stay. We will certainly return.",5,2008,03,10
233,"Started as a distaster, but ended up as a great place","We arrived at Ariel House at midnight due to flight to Dublin being delayed. The receptionist informed us that we were not on the booking list until the next day, even though we had a written confirmation that confirmed the date we arrived. As they had nowhere to put us in, they gave us the room down the stairs, that pretty much looked and felt like one of the Gosford Park's rooms for the maids. To this date I am not sure if those are actually the rooms for people to stay, or just an emergency in cases such was ours. We couldn't get any sleep, as we were utterly disappointed (and the beds were awful!). The next morning, the manageress apologized for the mix-up and gave us the new room - on the top floor, overlooking the main entrance. That room was beautiful, clean and nice, with all that we needed and we could finally relax. As we spent the total of 8 nights there, it was very important that we were happy with the accommodation, and we were. As for the Ballsbridge area, it is well known to be one of the safest and quietest ones in Dublin, yet is pretty close to all the amenities, so you may actually take walks into the city centre. We even took public transport on several occasions, which is very well organized. For the trips out of Dublin, we took a cab that took us to Busaras station, which didn't cost much. All in all, Ariel House was a great experience in the end, but you really need to be either lucky with the room, or simply require a better one if you're not happy with the one you get.",4,2007,11,14
233,"Wonderful staff, comfy rooms, fab breakfast","My husband and I, together with another couple, just returned from a 10-day stay at Ariel House, a warm and inviting Victorian mansion converted into a small hotel where Irish hospitality reigns supreme. Our rooms were very attractive, though the lighting was a bit low -- more conducive to romance than to reading --  but an additional lamp will cheerfully be provided if you ask for it.  The cozy parlor on the ground floor is a nice place to peruse the brochures available in the front hall, offering a multitude of ideas on how to spend your time in Dublin. And don’t hesitate to ask for suggestions on excursions or dining out – they’ll even check out restaurant websites so you can see the menus before deciding where to eat. Speaking of which, the nearby Kites restaurant offers fabulous Chinese fare, and Roly’s Pub has an imaginative menu – somewhat of a splurge, but well worth it (the Lobster Pot next door is more expensive but nowhere near as good). And absolutely do not miss ""An Evening of Food, Folk and Fairies"" at Dublin’s oldest (12th century) pub, the Brazen Head. You’ll spend a highly informative and entertaining evening listening to raconteur Johnny Daly describe Irish life in the 19th century and learn a bit about Irish folklore: fairies and leprechauns and what might befall anyone so foolish as to touch a fairy tree!  At 40 euros, including dinner, it’s one of Dublin’s best buys.

But what really made the Ariel House experience stand out for us was the incredible warmth, generosity and kindness of the management. We had planned to leave Dublin after 3 days to tour southern Ireland in a rental car.  This plan was cut abruptly short when I was hit by a speeding car while crossing the road near the DART station and ended up spending 4 days in St. Vincent’s Hospital. Ariel House manager Deirdre and her assistant Jennie couldn’t have been more helpful – they cancelled all our hotel reservations (suggesting most forcefully that none of them should dare to charge us for late cancellations), found a room for our friends for one night when the hotel was full, then brought them back to Ariel House for the remainder of our stay. They were a constant source of advice and support, offering every day to help in any way possible – I even received a lovely card and gift from them while in the hospital. Bottom line: you can’t go wrong at Ariel House, especially if you’re looking for those extra attentions that separate your run-of-the-mill hotel from a truly special guesthouse. PS: Don’t forget to order a basket of Deirdre’s yummy brown soda bread (toasted) for breakfast – with the orange and raspberry preserves and a cup of tea, it’s a meal in itself!
",5,2007,09,14
233,OK for one night,"We stayed there at the beginning of a 16-day trip to Ireland.

The room was big enough, the shower had no really pressure though and the bathroom floor was dirty.

The breakfast choice was really good, although we just had cereals and fresh fruits.

Summarized it was neither outstanding nor lousy, so 3 out of 5 seems pretty fair for 110€ double room.

",3,2007,09,11
233,Good value,"I was surprised to read the negative reviews about Ariel House as my husband and I had a very pleasant five-night stay there in March.  I contacted the hotel directly and our reservation was efficiently booked.  Once at the hotel, all of the staff with whom we had contact were friendly and helpful, including the gentleman at the desk who directed us to a delightful neighborhood pub and the young woman who booked a tour for us.  
Although our room was in the ""basement"" and was one of the rooms that had not been remodeled yet,  we found it clean and comfortable.  The decor might be called ""dated"", but it certainly was not  ""shabby"".  The bathroom was not small and had a bathtub as well as shower.
Ariel House is in a quiet neighborhood but only  half block from the DART station which we found convenient.  The breakfast, for us, was more than enough.  In addition to the selections on the menu,  there were cereal, fruit, juice, etc. on a sideboard and we could request additional toast.  We particularly liked the dark Irish bread!  In all, we were pleased with our accommodations and thought that, for the price, Ariel House gave us good value for what we paid.
",5,2007,09,08
233,Dump,"Looks nothing like the website, staff not that friendly. Curtains hanging off the rails in my room for £80 quid a night not including breakfast. i thought it was horrible. We was staying via expedia and have a superior room, but for some weird reason we stayed downstairs, do not stay downstairs!!!!
also our breakfast was included? so we got ripped off somewhere.

Going to write to Expedia because it false advertising saying on the net that the rooms look like that. Plus being told to have tap water when i needed a drink, tap water is bad for my stomach !!

Don't go !!!! 

Breakfast was rubbish also, burnt Bacon not alot of it xx

233,close to the DART,"I must agree with the some of the critics of Ariel house.
The house looked wonderful when entering the recption area, but the rooms was a let down. Ours was big, but with a window that didnt open much. The room was very hot (and why? This summer hasnt been good to Ireland). The beds were gigantic (twin beds), but there were only one lamp in the room, the one by the bed. The bathroom was ok, but we also found mold on the tiles.
breakfast was good, Fresh fruit with yougurt was great and the coffee was good to.
We choose the hotel as it was close to the DArt, and that it was. You could hear it very loud.
",3,2007,07,25
233,Loved it! Great Find,"I just read the very negative review of the Ariel House and couldn't  believe it was the same place my sister and I stayed. Our room was in the basement, but we had no mold, no strange smells, and the service was wonderful. I loved the bath because it had 2 windows for cross-ventilation. The beds were comfy and the breakfast was to die for.  I was expecting a rather small breakfast but found that they served as much as I wanted to eat. 

The salon is elegant, although we didn't spend time there.  The desk people were very helpful, and our best find was that Ariel House is only a block away from DART, which is definitely the best way to use public transportatin in Dublin!
",5,2007,07,21
233,Absolutely dreadful service and dirty,"My boyfriend and I stayed at numerous B&B's throughout Ireland, Wales and England rating from 3-5 stars, and this ""5 Star"" was the worst place we stayed. Ariel House was little shy of a dump.
First, the gentleman who was running the front desk was unspeakably rude, barely looked at us to hand us a key. For the entirety of our first day he spent time on the phone yelling and swearing about someone's daughter, no one could even use the common areas. Everyone staying was disturbed by his yelling.
The first room he put us in was so filthy (and in the basement no less) I couldn't believe it, peeling paint, mold, dirt. When I asked for another room... oh, it was just terrible. The next bedroom in the old wing, had softer beds, nicer decor and thank goodness a window to air it out. Still the bathroom was not in very nice shape, dirty (around toilet and in tub) and it reeked of mold and mildew. 
On a brighter side, because it can't be all bad right, the woman (who apparantly belonged to the family owning the Ariel House) was apologetic, sweet and highly professional. She gave us accurate directions and good advice.
The breakfast/dining area was lovely and the traditional breakfast was pretty tasty. 
Also the wireless internet in the common areas was a godsend, and the common area / living room was beautifully decorated.
Still, as I said before, I stayed in cheaper, lower rated hotels and B&B's with supreme service and cleanliness. I would never reccomend the Ariel House to anyone staying in Dublin.
",1,2007,07,17
233,Problems with Ariel House,"Ariel House was our 7th and last stop on our two and a half week tour of Ireland. We began our stay at Roxford Lodge, two blocks up and one block over from Ariel House. When I first decided on the Ballsbridge area of Dublin, I couldn’t decide between Roxford and Ariel, so I decided to try both, as bookends to our trip. 

Ariel House is in two Georgian townhouses with a connecting hallway. I was impressed with the common rooms. The trip advisor recommendations were all positive, except for one, which mentioned a moldy bathroom in a downstairs room. I discounted that as an aberration. Yet walking up the granite stairs to the front door, it’s impossible to miss the fact that the ground has settled and the stairs are off-kilter, giving a first impression of disrepair. Our rooms (we had two) were adequate, but the bathroom in our downstairs room was sadly neglected, and yes, the mold was so evident that I took a picture. The other problem is that the DART line is just a hundred feet away and the trains rumble by at late hours (rather like the EL in Chicago), which makes sleeping fitful. 

On the positive side, it is close to the DART station if you don’t like the bus or walking, the staff is helpful, and the common rooms are well-kept.

233,Phooey to Fodor's,"This hotel was given a great review in Fodor's but  was one of the worst places I have ever stayed.  When we arrived, lugging suitcases up the stone steps, the ""manager"" just sat there not saying a thing.  I said we wanted to check in and he just handed me a key and said to go downstairs.  We struggled to get our suitcases through two sets of doors and down a staircase with no offer of help and not a word of welcome. 

The room itself was a catastrophe.  The bedspreads were dirty; the ironing board cover was badly stained; and unlike what another guest experienced, the room TV was old and VERY small; the bathroom had hair on the floor and there was a used bar of soap that had dried onto the sink.  Unfortunately, my camera needed to be charged so I was unable to take pictures of this place.  Fortunately, the bedsheets looked clean so we stayed.

 We then went to find the manager to find out about taking DART into town.  He was not at the desk but was, instead, sprawled out on the parlor sofa watching TV and eating biscuits!  I asked him what DART cost and he said 20 - 35 cents - which was completely incorrect.

Another reviewer talked about the lovely breakfast room.  That was not at all what we experienced.  The carpeting was filthy - you could see a distinct trail from the kitchen out to the eating area.  Breakfast itself was spartan - tea, toasted white bread,  a limited array of ready-to-eat cereals, and a few pitchers of juice.
Fodor's said the hotel had ""homemade preserves and oven-warm scones.""  We saw neither.

The only positive aspect of our stay was that the night manager was very pleasant.  He was also helpful and knowledgeable about travel time to the airport, and he arranged for an early wakeup call.  

Fodor's review also said ""Owner Michael O'Brien is an extraordinarily helpful and gracious host.""  Well, according to the daytime manager, Michael O'Brien hasn't owned the property for 5 years and clearly he took his graciousness with him when he left!

233,"Nice, but not quite","The hotel itself is a lovely building and the staff pleasant and around when you need them.  Also extremely handy for the DART.  Unfortunately our room overlooked the bins (overflowing) on the ground floor out the back.  The walls of the room were scuffed and it looked like it was used to store furniture and used as a room when all others are filled.  We had read reviews about how wonderful the breakfast was, but to be honest  although there was a good choice, but we have had better.
",2,2007,06,26
233,Fun stay at Ariel House,"We had a great stay in this hotel.

It's within two miles or so of many of Dublin's sites such as Trinity College (Book of Kells), Dublin Castle, Christ Church, Temple Bar Square.  This means we were able to walk to all of our destinations and not pay any cab fare - what a money saver!

The breakfast is great, the wait staff friendly.

233,Best find in Ireland,"We loved the Ariel House.  We (and our traveling companions) were given large first floor rooms with elegant furnishings, including romantic  canopy beds.  Both rooms also had new flat screen TVs.   The breakfast room was recently redecorated and very lovely.  Great selections on the menu and later in the day tea and scones were served in the parlor.  Staff was very helpful and NICE.  We hated to leave and when we visit Ireland again, we'll definitely stay at the Ariel House.
",5,2007,06,09
233,First time in Ireland,"My husband and I made reservations for Ariel House by e-mailing them directly. We requested a ""junior suite"" in the front of the house because I had read this tip on Trip Advisor. We didn't rent a car because we read that Dublin is a walking city. When we arrived at Dublin Airport, we took an Aircoach which brought us to Ballsbridge. It was a short walk to Ariel House.  
We loved the tree-lined street and how quiet it was. Our room was big with a very comfortable bed. Breakfast in the conservatory was excellent- lots of choices. 
When we wanted to go to the City Centre, we just had to walk about a half a block to the DART station. 
The staff was very helpful. They tried to get an electric adaptor for me, but they  were out of the correct one.  We found a hardware store about 6 blocks away where we were able to buy one.
We had a great Thai dinner in Ballsbridge just a few blocks from the hotel.
I would  highly recommend Ariel House.
",4,2007,05,20
233,Beautiful Hotel in a Great Neighborhood,"We stayed at the Ariel house in November and got a great rate.  The hotel is in a beautiful tree-lined neighborhood within a block or two of the DART.  It was perfect for us- we had two rooms, one for me and my boyfriend and one for my boyfriend's parents.  

Do ask for a room in the front- his parents' room was SUBSTANTIALLY larger than ours which was downstairs in the back.  Their room had a spectacular view of the street, ours had a view of the parking area.  Regardless, if I hadn't seen their room, ours would have felt perfectly nice anyway.  

Breakfast is small but nice.  The staff was pleasant and I particularly enjoyed their sunroom in the front, complete with chess which we played as we waited for his parents to come downstairs each morning.  

I would absolutely recommend a stay here- the location is great and absolultely convenient to city-center Dublin by DART.
",4,2007,02,22
233,"great room, great location, great breakfast!","Stayed in a twin room in Aerial House for two nights - a very spacious and comfortable room, with delightful period furniture. Staff were very friendly and helpful and provided a very large range of breakfast items - you will not go away hungry! The hotel is ideally located for the DART station, bus routes and even walking into the city centre (about 30 minutes). I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends and family visiting Dublin.
",5,2007,01,14
233,Very comfortable in a nice area,"Stayed at this hotel with my wife and daughter for our last couple of nights in Ireland.  The hotel is in a very nice area in Ballsbridge, and the area has a nice safe feel and is a leafy suburb of Dublin.  Our room was large, albeit a fair distance from the reception desk, and down a couple of flights of stairs.  The bathroom was a bit ancient, but functioned well.  Very welcoming reception staff, and a very nice breakfast rounded off a comfortable stay.  Very close to bus and train transport, and not far from Dublin centre.
A hint.  If you are driving from the hotel to Dublin Airport get good directions and a very good map.  Don't rely on the road signs to get you to the airport, or you will end up doing an extended and unexpected, and frustrating, street tour of Dublin (as we did).
",4,2007,01,09
233,"Great Location, Friendly Staff, Very Comfortable","This was our second trip to Ireland - first time we stayed in Bray.  We found the Ariel House to be in a lovely neighborhood on a quiet and elegant street.  The DART was a very short walk away which gets you right to the City Center in minutes.  The staff at the Ariel House was very friendly and very accomodating.  We had several early departures and they made sure to have a little bit of breakfast out and a taxi waiting for us each morning - you can't ask for more.  They have a very nice front sitting room which a chess board we used every morning.  They have a nice selection for breakfast - much more than the average hotel which might only offer the traditional ""Irish Fry.""  Try the Pancakes!  The rooms vary in size - they gave us one room at the front of the House on the second floor which had a great view and was VERY big.  The second room was on the first floor and not as big, but was still comfortable and clean.  The room had sufficient amenities and we only had problems with hallway noise on one brief occasion.  As far as European Hotels go, this one rates high - the shower was large and nice, the bedroom clean, the beds comfortable.  They know how to host and we would gladly stay here again.
",4,2006,12,19
233,Gracious Elegance and Hospitality,"Request the Jr. Suite - it was elegant.  Poster bed and antique furnishing, large windows (most likely was the parlor in great georgian residence).  Beautiful armoir.....Bathtub was large enough for two, though the shower was typical to a small room in Paris but great water pressure.  Jennie was most helpful with arranging travel to Cliffs of Moher and transportation and accommadation in Galway (she arranged while we packed-on such short notice).  Deidre was so kind and arranged for breakfast delivered to our suite when we over slept from our first Saturday night in Temple Bar and surroundings and also on arrival from the airport in the early AM the day before.  The breakfast room is so pleasant but the Irish Breakfast was amazing.
",5,2006,11,30
233,What a nightmare,"The owners of the Ariel House should be ashamed of the conditions of this establishment and should truely portray it on its website the way it really looks like. Otherwise what they are really doing is false advertising (which is illegal in other countries!). The room we got was dowstairs, number 240 and it looked like they had taken the furniture out of some attic or thrift store to use as decoration. Aside of that the bathroom was a nightmare with broken  tiles surrounded by mold, uncovered toilet pipes and spiders and silverfishes  (those sluggy, tiny animals) were claiming it its territory. We turned on the heater, and we found tons of dust from the 18th century hanging from the radiator. When we requested a change of room, we were told that the hotel was booked out, so we didn't have any choice, but to stay there. My husband and I didn't feel comfortable there. We were disgusted by it and we felt like we had been scammed and ripped off, having paid 100 Euros for a supposedly 4 star hotel, that looked in actuality more like my grandmother's basement. The only positive thing that I have to say about this place was the breakfast. It was very good and great in variety, but it was not enough to convince us to ever come back. The owners should and must definitely invest in the improvement of the conditions of this hotel or if not then at least take off a couple of its claimed stars, as well as lower the price on their rooms.

233,Great location for matches at Lansdowne,"We stayed at Ariel House for just one night.  We were in Dublin for the Ireland v South Africa match (c'mon Ireland!!).  Location was fantastic.  Literally a 1 minute walk to Lansdowne Stadium.  We also went to Toys 4 Big Boyz.  Again location was perfect - a 10 minute walk.  We were in room 238 which was downstairs.  A slightly musty smell on the way down the corridor but the room was grand.  Bigger than your average hotel room.  Shower was lovely and hot but the pressure wasn't great.  The TV was only a portable but we weren't there to watch tv.  Breakfast was lovely with good choices.  Would stay there again if going to anywhere in Ballsbridge especially the RDS & matches at Lansdowne.  Forgot to take pictures of the room but it was very old style.
",4,2006,11,13
233,Excellent stay!,"It's no wonder Ariel House has won awards for tourist accommodation.  The front desk staff is very friendly and helpful; the room we had was lovely and spacious; the area is quiet (though there will soon be major construction going on in the area but if you're out all day it shouldn't be a problem); the DART (public transport system) is a half a block away and you can use it to get into the city centre OR get a day pass and do day trips south or north on the coast, and it's a straight (by Dublin standards) 20 minute walk into the city centre if you wish.  We did it most everyday.  And the included breakfast is fantastic!  Contact them directly - you may get a better rate than you find on-line as I did.
",5,2006,10,14
233,Pleasantly surprised,"Based on some of the reviews I read here, I was a little concerned, but didn't need to be.  What a lovely room we had! Large & nicely furnished.  Very comfortable & with a good sized bathroom.  Breakfasts were great with a nice selection from their hot menu items.  Try to be early to get a good table in the atrium!  Public transit is just 1/2 a block down the street, but if it's a nice day, it's a pleasent 20-25 min walk to town.
",4,2006,10,10
233,Great B&B for a stay in Dublin,"My family has just spent a week in Dublin.  The reason we stayed at Ariel House was that it was the only place our travel agent could find that would take the four of us (we have a 2 year-old and a 9-month old) in the same room.

Ariel House was everything we needed for an enjoyable stay in Dublin.  The room was spacious and comfortable, and the breakfasts were fantastic (I especially recommend the French Toast - get two slices).

Ariel House is only about a 2-minute walk from the Lansdowne Road Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) station, which makes it very convenient for travelling into Dublin City Center or for heading north of the city to the seaside villages of Malahide and Howth, or south of the city to Bray and Dalkey.

The staff were very friendly and really made you feel welcome.  I hope that we can go back to visit again someday.
",5,2006,09,28
233,Best breakfast service we've EVER had!,"We read about Ariel House on the web and stayed there last week. It reminds me of older hotels in a charming way...rooms are not perfect or modern, but give you a feeling of staying in someone's manor house. Really nice sitting room and extremely helpful staff...Emma stood outside to wave us in while we were on our cell phone and lost. The breakfast is worth the stay alone...unbelievable (award winning with a wall plaque to prove it) oatmeal (porridge) and fantastic array of cooked/continental breakfasts in a wonderful, ""consevatory-type"" breakfast room. The service is outstanding.
I'm not sure what generated some of the negative reviews re: the rooms. Ours was quiet, clean and charming. There is a football stadium half a block away, so if that's a concern you might want make sure to ask if there would be a game on during your stay.
We loved it and highly recommend it for a non-Sheraton experience and a 5 star breakfast!
",4,2006,08,22
233,disappointed,"We stayed in the Ariel Hotel in Dublin for five nights.  The room was adequate.  The breakfast is fantastic and impressive.  However, the hotel did not change our sheets during this period.
We had made several local calls.  However, when we checked out we had an additional change of 25 Euros for telephone calls.   We were told that is the charge for local calls.

This hotel may have four stars but should not!!
",3,2006,07,25
233,A very rare find,"Cannot recommend this place highly enough. It is NOT an hotel - there is only a breakfast room and no bar, but there is a very pretty, huge guest lounge - however it has the feel of a nice, small city hotel and is within walking/bus/taxi to everything you'd need in Dublin.

Also The Dart, Dublin's commuter railway, is a 30 second walk within sight of the hotel and will take you into the city centre - albeit not the nicest part, you have a 10 minute walk to St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street - in less than ten minutes max. But do check the train times: otherwise you can be waiting at The Dart for up to half an hour if you just miss one.

The rooms do vary: some in the old part of the house are very big, those in the basement a bit dark but very nicely done. For the price, and it's locality, this is absolutely not a rip-off, which is saying something in Ireland and Dublin in particular.

On a nice evening, the road outside and the setting - a pretty tree lined street in the smartest area of Dublin - is delightful. It's not, in fairness, a place you'll spend the evening in but is a great spot from where to explore the city, and then return to the nice, calm atmosphere. 

If you do want to eat in your room after, say, a long flight, there are very good restaurants nearby - pricey but this is Dublin's Mayfair or Upper East Side - that do great take-aways, and the staff will provide plates and the rest.

Sadly, because this is the expensive part of town, do be careful if you walk or get The Dart or bus back late at night: don't be paranoid but do watch for any potential muggers. Would advise - as with virtually anywhere in Dublin - getting a taxi if you are late coming back. Highly unlikely to be a problem, but you never know.

The staff are first-class. Forget the big City hotels unless you really want a late-bar and huge restaurants by the lifts. This place really is genuinely charming.
",5,2006,07,25
233,Yeech,"This place looked good on the web and had decent reviews, but DON'T be fooled!  The facade of the house covers a huge addition out the back that holds most of the rooms. The addition appears to have been built in the 50s or 60s. Our room was in the addition and was like a bad motel. It was ugly and small, the bed terrible and lumpy, but the worst part was the stinky bathroom full of mold. Even the water smelled badly! We were very disappointed and I'd never stay there again.
",1,2006,07,23
233,You need to be lucky with your room!,"We had a very pleasant stay in Ariel House. Great atmosphere! Good breakfast.

BUT, you have to be lucky with your room.

On arrival we got a smal room downstairs in the corridor. 
We sat down on the bed and then the whole bed started to move! The legs of the bed could break down every moment!

We reported this to the management and they gave us an other room immediatly.
This room was much better: more space, nice high windows, pretty decorations, and (not unimportant) a good bed!

I hope they'll fix the bed soon, because this is a good place to stay in Dublin!
",3,2006,07,09
233,Great Breakfast,"We stayed at this hotel on two occassions, I'm glad we stayed the second time as it changed my opinion of the hotel.  On the first occassion we were given the last room they had available (room 140) it was slightly small and run down (eg bathroom tiles were falling off the wall).  We stayed there again because we only needed to stay one night, so the convience of knowing where it was and the great breakfast made us return. The room we were given on return was much larger and far nicer than the first room.  I've included images of both rooms.
The location is great, easy 5-10 minute to the city.  They have a some car parking spaces.  Staff are quite friendly.  I would stay there again.
",4,2006,06,24
233,Tender Loving Care!,"My wife, Darlene, Darlene and I arrived at the Ariel House late in the evening of May 19, 2006, exhausted following a very busy day.  We were met at the door by Jimmy Keogh who was the manager on duty that evening and our every care and comfort was attended to in great fashion.  It was our first stay at Ariel House and it will not be our last.  We heartily recommend the service, the exceptional breakfast choices of the Ariel House which were only exceeded by the exceptional warmth of the hospitality.  My wife still refers to Jimmy as ""The Angel"".  Sincerely, Tom and Darlene White, Edina, Minnesota U.S.A.
",5,2006,06,06
233,Friendly down home comfortable,"My Mother and I stayed at the Ariel House on our first night in Dublin and before leaving to travel the countryside we arranged to stay there upon our return to Dublin 8 days later for our last 3 nights in Ireland.  
Upon our arrival very early on a Friday morning a taxi driver suggested the Ariel House to us.  It was a pleasant experience right from the jump, as we Americans say.  Anyway, we had a lovely room and enjoyed the breakfast (being cooked by Arthur from Poland I believe).  The cereals, yogurt, sunshine morning breakfast room, the service and kindness of the staff all made for an excellent stay.
",5,2006,04,24
233,"Comfortable,clean and cosy","Stayed in Ariel house for one night. From the moment we arrived the staff were very nice and helpful with directions. The room was very big spacious and clean, with tea and coffee making facilities. The breakfast the following morning was fabulous, with fresh fruit , cereals , juices and a selection of hot food, fry's etc. I would definately recomend staying here again , it was in a perfect location for going to the RDS or Lansdowne road.
",5,2006,04,13
233,Fantastic & charming Dublin Hotel,"If staying in Dublin I would make this my first choice. Its close to the DART public transport (just 3 stops to the heart of Dublin. The hotel is beautifully decorated in an old-fashioned and charming style. Rooms have high ceilings, chandeliers, velvet drapes etc... A wonderful Irish breakfast is offered in the light and airy dining room. Hotel staff are beyond helpful and friendly (they booked my return London flight for me online). A 1 minute walk from Lansdowne Road Rugby Football Ground makes it ideal if you are planning on taking in some rugby on your visit. Located in the quiet, leafy 'embassy' area of Dublin it's also ideal if you have business in this area (the reason I chose it). Only one setback - very limited parking and difficult to manouevre your car out of, but you can't do much about that when staying in cities like London and Dublin.
",5,2006,03,03
233,"Fantastic, Charming Place to Stay","For our first trip to Dublin, we stayed at this charming guesthouse located outside Dublin city in a beautiful suburb called Ballsbridge for 5 nights.  However, it couldn't be easier to get into town either by foot (a straight walk into town through lovely areas) or by train, which is only about a 1 minute walk from the guesthouse with the ride into downtown is less than 10 mintues (and is very cheap).  With the same train, we took an inexpensive trip north of Dublin to visit a 12th century castle and south to the coastal villages.  The staff is excellent and very helpful, the salon and breakfast room are both relaxing and beautiful (and the breakfast very tasty), and the rooms are very sizable, clean, and quiet.  We will definitely be back to stay here again!!  Thanks so much to Deidre and her staff!
",5,2006,02,22
233,Good Value and very Friendly,"Just back from our second stay at Ariel House, we're both keen rugby fans and this hotel location is superb! Just beside the Rugby Ground and within walking distance of a few good pubs! Ariel House is more like a B&B than a hotel, but its clean, comfortable and friendly plus you can be assured of a quiet night's sleep. We were given a superior room in the main house, it was very ornately decorated which wouldn't be everyone's taste but it was clean. The bathroom ceiling needed painted and the heating wasn't on the entire time we were there, despite being freezing outside. Although they must have known this and provided an oil-filled radiator which kept the room adequately heated. The one thing with that was the fact that there was only 2 sockets in the room - therefore you could only have 2 appliances on at any one time, with the radiator taking up one socket it was a choice of TV or kettle! It was a lot of swopping and changing but needs must! Breakfast the next morning was hectic, it was very busy being an international rugby weekend but we had to wait only a short time for a table. Portions in Ariel are on the small side but I'm sure if you asked for more it wouldn't be a problem. Overall it is a great place to stay - good value for money and centrally located with the DART only 2 mins away (not noisy at all)",4,2006,02,07
233,Great Place to Stay,"This is a great place to stay if you want to see Dublin and the surrounding area. My wife and I arrived in Dublin 22 January and stayed for six nights. The aircoach takes you from the airport to jury's in ballsridge for 7 euros each. It's a block and half walk to the Ariel House. Once you're at the Ariel House, it's a four minute walk to the rapid transit, the Dart. If you go in january, there are lots of sales and not many tourists. Most hotels, bed and breakfasts and inns are on streets where there is lots of traffic. The Ariel House is on a quiet street. You can catch the bus to the center of town from the Jury's. It's a nice area with lots of embassies. The rooms at the Ariel House are spacious with full bathrooms. There is a nice area set aside for breakfast. The tables have white linen and five selections to choose from for breakfast. The rate is reasonable for Dublin and the staff very helpful. On numerous occasions Deidre McDonald helped us with our plans. There are more expensive hotels nearby, Bewley's and the Four Seasons, if you want to go for a meal or Guiness. We used public transportation for seeing Dublin, Dalkey, and Kilkenny. The Ariel House is for us the place to stay in Dublin.

233,Great stay,"Great value, exrta nice and very hospitible staff.
Bed and Breakfast above and beyond.  Not the biggest place, but cared for us very well.  Breakfast was outstanding.
Close to DART and the buses, this place was great.
We will definitely stay again on our next trip.
Dublin is a safe and fun place to visit.
What a vacation.
This place will be our hub next holiday.
Thanks again, Ariel House.
",5,2006,01,28
233,You'll like it too,"My wife and I have just returned from a fabulous 4 days in Dublin.  We stayed at the Ariel House Hotel which is located in the lovely suburb of Ballsbridge - a pleasant 30 minute walk from the centre of the City.  If you don't want to walk, taxis and buses are nearby.  There are a number of cafes, restaurants and pubs all within a few minutes walk from the Hotel. 

All the staff were very friendly, courteous and professional. Our room was spacious and in immaculate condition.  We enjoyed breakfast every morning in the Hotel's dining room, overlooking the rear gardens.  My particular favourite was the french toast,  bacon and maple syrup.  What a combination!  The Ariel House platter is also worthy of mention. Add to this the delicious home made jams and toast, quality teas and coffee and what more could you want to start your day.

All in all, we had a very enjoyable stay and I have no hesitation in recommending the Hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.

233,Not too bad...,"My husband and I stayed here in May 2005 for our 2nd wedding anniversary. We were given a room in the main house but at the back which was ok. Plenty of space but you just felt like the place could do with a bit of a re vamp.

Had a bath that was supposed to have bubbles, but it didn't seem to work, also the shower was very difficult to turn on. Breakfast was ok, bigger portions could have improved it. It was funny watching Americans dissecting a black and a white pudding! They were horrified when we told them what it actually was!

The price was reasonable and the City Centre was close by on the train. Piece of advice though, the DART trains don't run at weekends, so you could be in for a long walk!

Can reccomend the Jurys hotel at the end of Lansdowne Road for eating though, had a fab meal in what was supposed to be their coffee shop, not too expensive and very friendly.

Felt quite sorry for this property, it has obviously been very grand once, just needs someone to love it again. :-)

233,A nice little B&B,"I was stuck in Dublin for a week, having intended to stay for only 2 nights.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful, including driving me to a stationary shop for supplies (I was a bit pregnant at the time!).  The guesthouse could do with a bit of TLC and my room wasn't great but it's in a good location, great rates and customer service was excellent.  I've read some of the other reviews and perhaps our American cousins don't understand the difference between a guesthouse and a hotelalthough this should have been obvious from the rates.
",4,2005,04,07
233,very pleasant stay,"We stayed at this hotel from 22 February to 26 February 2005. We had a very nice room and the staff could not have been more helpful even booking a table at a nearby restaurant for us. There was a good choice in the breakfast menu and again the staff in the restaurant were very attentive. We will certainly be staying at this hotel again.
",4,2005,03,04
233,"Clean, comfortable, convenient – and a good value!","I was more than satisfied with this charming guest-house, which feels more like a B&B than a hotel. The room I stayed in, situated in the main house, was large and simply furnished with used furniture. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the breakfast was good, and the neighbourhood was lovely. I think that the people who have complaints about this place had the misfortune to be put in one of the rooms in the back ground-floor addition, which looked pretty damp and grungy. I was told by one of the staff that they only put people back there in a fully-booked situation – usually when there is a concert or match at nearbye Lansdowne stadium. As long as I could ensure that I would be put in the main house, I would definitely stay here again.
",4,2004,10,21
233,Solid Place to stay - would recommend it,"I was booked in here by a vendor, after asking for a nice place that would allow me easy access to the city.  This hotel fulfilled all those expectations - a pleasant B&B - nice grounds, solid facilities (a bit dated, but if you want modern, go stay in a Four Seasons for 3-4 times the price), a courteous and helpful staff, and a good breakfast.  Rates were very affordable.  It was easy to walk 3 blocks for a nice pub meal and a pint, or catch the nearby train into City Centre (or walk the 20 min) to access the heart of downtown.  I'd repeat here in a minute..
",4,2004,10,16
233,Enjoyed the hotel,"My wife and I stayed two days in Dublin at Ariel House.  If you are looking for good rooms on a quiet street, friendly, helpful staff, good access to DART, we would recommend staying at Ariel House.
",4,2004,10,01
233,Not brilliant but OK,"We booked 5 months early and got a good room. Breakfast was excellent and the service was always efficient and polite.  The hotel was clean and only 15 mins taxi ride from the city centre.  Not the best '4 star' hotel I've stayed in (!) but certainly OK for the money.  The only problem with our stay was moaning Americans, but you get that everywhere don't you?

",3,2004,08,23
233,Doesn't rate 4 stars,"We were bitterly disappointed in this hotel, we were expecting a lovely 4 star hotel, unfortunately instead we received a musty, damp and dirty room where the curtains were hanging off the rails, the  wallpaper was peeling off the walls and in the bathroom was unclean.

Not what we expected to find by the level of advertising on their website.

Most definitely would not recommend this hotel.
",1,2004,08,10
233,Fraud!,"I did not stay at the hotel as 2 days before my arrival they notified me of a broken boiler and that they would upgrade me into a 5 star hotel elsewhere in Dublin. Note: that weekend all hotels in Dublin were overbooked due to a big festival. They sent me to a 3 star hotel in Temple Bar right above a night club, where they had no idea of my transfer and asked me to pay a higher rate. A month later I received an additional credit card charge by a travel agency that Ariel House had used to book me into the Temple Bar hotel. I was never aware of this booking and never received an invoice of any sort. When I tried disputing the charge the Ariel general manager avoided my calls bluntly, she said she would call me back shortly and never did and when I called again I was told by staff that she was not there.

233,Big Letdown,"It was a definite letdown when I finally got to Dublin.  The room was on the lower level at the back of the building; an addition to the building.  It was musty smelling, darkly lit and shabby.  It has definitely seen better days.  Need a complete renovation to bring it back to life.  Meals were scrimpy.  My wake up call and early breakfast did not materialize before I had to leave.  Big disappointment.
",1,2004,06,28
233,Seen better days...,"We stayed at this hotel the final night of our tour around Ireland. 
It's in a decent enough neighborhood and fairly centrally located. My fiance, who is Irish, told me his grandfather used to stay here back in the 60's and it was quite a posh place at that time. Well...let's just say that Ariel House is no longer in the prime of life and is attempting to age gracefully with partial success. The rooms weren't bad...but weren't great either. They are spacious but with dated decor, creaky floors, and the like. The bed was rather uncomfortable and the bathroom was very narrow...you had to back up a bit in order to open and close the door. That said, the heaters worked and the hot water never ran out. In fact, due to the ""two tap"" system, I almost scalded myself in the bathtub. A basic, practical place to stay if you're in a rush and not looking for a lot of ambiance.",3,2004,04,21
233,shabby chic,"I visited the Ariel House in mid-March 2004 for four nights, on an air-hotel package deal through expedia.com. The hotel is in a lovely residential neighborhood just steps from public transportation. Our room was adequate, although mattresses were a bit lumpy and worn. Furnishings are a bit worn, also. The entire place, particularly the front lobby, needs an overhaul. It's a charming hotel if you enjoy slightly rundown, shabby chic ambience. But be forewarned that not all rooms look like the ones shown on their website. The staff was friendly, generally, but seemed slightly befuddled.",2,2004,03,27
233,Awesome Ariel House!,"Service, Service, Service!!! The entire staff blew us away with their can do attitude and sheer kindness. Stayed there for 5 nights while we took day trips and traveled the countryside (thanks for the great directions Diedre)!Stayed in a great room for 3 nights, overnighted in Waterford one night at the castle (we stored lots of bags in the Ariel storage room...""no worries"") and returned to Ariel, stayed in another great room for 2 more nights (this one with a 4 poster bed) and my kids had another room across the hall.Jimmy at the desk got us Rugby tickets...Ireland vs. Italy. It was at Lansdowne Rd. stadium just down the street. The match was sold out but Diedre and Jimmy worked their magic and were able to find someone who had tickets and sold them to me at COST!!!! It was the 1st time I ever saw an International match of any kind (I'm a sports nut) and it's something my sons and I will never forget. Thanks again...I'm putting that day on my life's highlight reel!The breakfasts and dining room were great, the staff was friendly (they even sent our Waterford castle key back to them when we forgot to leave it) and the lounge was great to watch the tube, hang out or read the paper.I highly recommend this b and b (it's actually more of a hotel with the breakfast) for it's location (1 stop on the DART which is about 100 yards away to downtown), for the great rooms but most of all for the friendliness and competence of the entire staff! They really made our vacation GREAT! We'll be back!Tom McEneny and Family",5,2004,03,23
233,Nice place but with traps!! Beware!!,"The place is nice but beware of the management. The staff offered free laundry service but destroyed $200 worth of my shirts. $500 in total for our group! Offered to replace them but never did anything!! Diedre, the manager, in not trustwothy. Beware!!

David LaFleur",4,2003,12,04
233,Nothing was to much trouble,"We stayed at Ariel House October 2003 we could not have asked for a better place to stay Staff were FANTASTIC, rooms of a very good standard. As my husband is disabled he was catered for extremlely well. Ariel House is within easy reach of town by the Dart railway or a couple of miles by foot. When we go back to Dublin we shall certainly stay at Ariel house",5,2003,11,20
233,Genuine customer service,"Ariel House is physically a pleasant hotel/ B&B with a relaxed slightly regal feel to it, rooms are large and elegant.Most importantly however the attitude of the staff towards their guests is overall very good and in many cases impecable, a warmth and healpfullness that made our stay in Dublin all the better.",5,2003,09,04
233,Excellant Stay,I stayed at the Ariel Guest House with my three children in October 2002. We had an excellant week there and found the staff to be extremely helpful and courteous. The rooms were clean and well appointed. I will be staying there again.,5,2003,03,04
233,Elegant Comfort & Charm,"Staying in the Ariel House was the heart of our trip to Ireland.  Located in the heart of Dublin and yet located in that seemingly ""quiet Sunday afternoon"" atmosphere, made this Bed and Breakfast perfect for however we chose to enjoy our vacation.  The rooms and amenities are elegant, immaculate and so warm.  This is the perfect spot for the most fabulous vacation.
",5,2001,11,23
233,Spectacular,"Fabulous hotel a few kilometers from the center. Charming decor, spacious and clean rooms fully equipped.  Best of all, the exquisite treatment of the staff both at reception and in the restaurant area and over all BREAKFAST (rich, abundant and very varied). A spectacular hotel 💯 recommended",5,2024,10,07
233,Some still need renovation,"We knew that Dublin was one of the most expensive cities in Europe. We paid 1216,- € for 5 nights in a Deluxe Room. Breakfast and parking incl.
The staff is very friendly and helpful. The common room is cozy , a meeting place for guests and there are pastries , tea, coffee and refreshments available free of charge. Breakfast is really very good. Location and transport connections are optimal.If there is an event in the stadium , you are there live... 
Now comes the BUT. The rooms have simple glazing , the bathroom window could not be opened. The sink had a crack , the mirror was broken and there was mold. For us, these shortcomings have nothing to do with the preservation of Victorian charm. Conclusion : we liked it because we met very nice people.",4,2024,09,29
233,Very good,"We had a great time the location is great, the staff is very friendly and helpful the hotel is very clean and cozy with large rooms and tastefully decorated. In the lounge on the veranda you can have tea and coffee with cake and delicious biscuits. Highlight the SUPER BREAKFAST. I will recommend it to everyone.",5,2024,09,16

233,Accommodation in a typical residence near the center of Dublinino,"Very nice property in a very quiet area of Dublin, good accommodation in the family room although the double beds were a bit small for adults. Very good breakfast with different choices for all tastes.",4,2024,08,03
233,Stay Ariel House,"The staff is very nice and friendly 
Breakfast is excellent 😋😋😋😋 
The afternoon cake is excellent
Location is very good 

The room was old and in need of renovation, carpet is unhygienic, bathroom is old and not worth 4 stars. In the bathroom there is no socket for hairdryer, in the room is a bedside lamp without socket???
The rooms are very noisy, you can hear the creaking of the parquet floor from above, the doors close very loudly 
The double bed is too small (very narrow)
Toilet Paper and soap were not refilled",3,2024,06,23
233,Beautiful structure,"Booked for the Atalanta Leverkusen match due to its proximity to the stadium, it was an excellent choice. The structure is truly welcoming, the dining room and the veranda where you have breakfast are beautiful, it also has a garden and private parking. Also very convenient for its location in an elegant and quiet residential neighborhood not far from the center and a few meters away from the DART station, the light train that takes you to the city center in 3 stops. Comfortable and clean room even if not very large, excellent quality linen, the bathroom was just sufficient, old and quite small with a bathtub with a rather low shower head for a tall person like me (a little advice: if the bathroom were to be redone it would be eliminate the tub to create space for a large shower cubicle). Both sweet and savory breakfasts are plentiful and of excellent quality, they also offer tea, coffee and pastries in the dining room to enjoy a few moments of relaxation. Friendly and very helpful staff, including Emerson who gave us all the information we requested. Price rather high but probably due to the football event and the fact that Dublin is not exactly a cheap city. Definitely recommended for anyone wishing to stay in the capital of Ireland",4,2024,05,24
233,Dublin,"Beautiful Victorian residence transformed into a hotel, excellent atmosphere with great courtesy and helpfulness of the staff. Comfortable and warm room, even too much, good breakfast with waiting time for the table, however, needs improvement. Basic bathroom.",4,2024,05,01
233,A beautiful Dublin guest house,"We stayed two nights during our stay in Dublin. Ariel House is a classic Victorian-style guest house, in a great location in the Ballsbridge district, one of Dublin's most elegant. A stone's throw away is the Aviva Stadium, where rugby and football are played, and the suburban train station (DART), which takes you to the center in five minutes (also reachable on foot in about twenty minutes). The structure was created by connecting three typical Victorian houses. So there are a lot of stairs to climb up and down to reach the rooms. Check in without a hitch, even though we arrived before a football match (Ireland vs England Women) and they were about to close access to the street. Friendly and professional welcome. We had a standard room on the ground floor of one of the three houses with a window onto the garden. Not very big, but comfortable enough and very quiet. The bed is good, the duvet is less good. Perhaps they had run out of double duvets and put two single ones, but not lengthwise, but crosswise so that they overlapped, a strange solution, which however did not prevent us from sleeping well. The living room at the entrance is welcoming and typically British, with coffee and tea always available (excellent), as well as some butter biscuits. A good place to relax or shelter from the rain. Excellent breakfast in a beautiful room next to reception. The ""Traditional"" breakfast is truly excellent for those who, like me, love an Irish breakfast (a rasher of bacon, one egg, one sausage, mushrooms, black and white pudding and cherry tomatoes), all with excellent tea. In addition to the traditional, the menu included a rich choice of savory or sweet breakfasts, as well as a buffet with a wide choice of desserts and cheeses, as well as various cereals. In short, breakfast is undoubtedly the strong point of Ariel House! Unfortunately, however, the weak point, but truly weak, was the bathroom, old, poorly furnished, poor, with a paltry shower in a relatively new but uncomfortable tub. Toilet that didn't work well, no toiletries, apart from a couple of dispensers for the shower and on the sink. If it weren't for the forgettable bathroom, Ariel House would deserve five stars.",4,2024,04,17
233,We will return without a doubt,"Small charming hotel, located outside the city in a residential area without any type of business, but very quiet, and 200 meters from a train station, which in three stops, 7 or 10 minutes you are in the center. Spacious and very quiet room since I requested that it face the back of the hotel on the 2nd and last floor. Good breakfast, a dish prepared at the time you choose and another buffet-style part that you serve yourself, for my taste with very little repertoire of dishes, especially sausages, which there are not, and some type of cakes or artisan pastries and different kinds of fruits, they do not serve natural orange juice.
Regarding the staff, I have to say that in general it is great, although a special mention at reception goes to Emerson Oliveira, for his kindness and decisiveness in any situation, especially when it comes to understanding each other, also the staff that makes the rooms, especially a Brazilian lady from which I don't know the name and also José who is the staff who serves breakfast, friendly and efficient, he speaks perfect Spanish",4,2024,03,23
233,We enjoyed it very much!,"We slept well, the breakfast was great and the staff very nice!
Unfortunately we couldn't open the window in the room on our first night, but that was fixed the next day.
Also, at least our room, was quite thinly soundproof, or elephants were secretly dancing above us.
But all in all it was very nice!
",5,2023,12,14
233,Very nice & lovingly furnished hotel in a pleasant location,"The staff are very friendly. The food is delicious. It is very nice that there is free tea and coffee available in the ""living room"" every day - cakes and biscuits are also available. The room was also very nice. Only the bathtub and the shower wall were leaky and so we always had to put towels on the floor.
But overall we were very satisfied and would recommend it.",5,2023,10,31
233,An excellent option,"We only stayed one night, but certainly when I return to Dublin it is easy to repeat.
The beds are comfortable and the room is quiet and clean. It is very easy to get to the center with the DART just two stops and the station is a minute walk away. The best, the staff and the breakfast. All the staff without exception were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast, the typical Irish breakfast, quality products and very tasty and buffet of pastries, fruit, cereals and various breakfast products a 10
In addition to free parking.
I would repeat without hesitation.",5,2023,09,20
233,Good hotel,"We booked this hotel as the last stop on our Ireland tour. There were 4 of us and we got 2 double rooms on the first floor. We arrived at the hotel before the possible check-in time and were allowed to use the guest area (with water, coffee...). They even helped us with our suitcases later. Both rooms were clean. The bathrooms are a bit old. It's really awkward to shower if you're taller than 1.80 meters, as the shower head is firmly attached to the wall. Unfortunately, all rooms have carpets, which may not be good for allergy sufferers. The rooms are unfortunately very thinly soundproof. Unfortunately, we hardly had a WiFi signal in either room. The breakfast room is a bit too small, as you have to wait until a table is free. The staff are very friendly and attentive and bring you to your table. There is a menu for breakfast from which you can choose something. Breakfast is sufficient and good. The location is good and very close to the train station or bus stop.",4,2023,09,03

Die Mitarbeiter sind sehr freundlich, aufmerksam und hilfsbereit. Besonders Engin der uns sogar die Koffer ins Auto getragen hat. Sehr nett.
Das Zimmer im Basement hat uns nicht so gut gefallen zumal ich in einer früheren Email ein Zimmer in einer oberen Etage angefragt hatte. Es war recht klein und sehr warm. Uns wurde ein Ventilator angeboten aber dann hätten wir noch weniger Platz im Zimmer gehabt. Die Bilder in der Hotelbeschreibung wecken leider andere Erwartungen. Der Klorollenhalter war rostig. 
Das Frühstück war gut.
Kostenlose Parkplätze waren vorhanden, leider ist uns auf diesem ein anderer Hotelgast ans Auto gefahren ohne sich zu melden obwohl es ganz eindeutig war.
Die Lage ist ruhig und man ist schnell mit der Bahn im Zentrum. ",3,2023,06,29
233,Lage zählt,"Leider das schlechteste B & B in unserer dreiwöchigen Irland Rundreise. Das Zimmer ist sehr klein. Das Bad ist so klein, dass man kaum etwas abstellen kann. Es gibt keinen Spiegel im Zimmer, in dem man sich ganz sehen kann. Es gibt kein Wasser, es gibt keine Kosmetiktücher. Wasser bekamen wir auf Nachfrage vom Nachtportier, die letzten beiden kleinen Flaschen, wie er sagte. Ausblick auf den Hinterhof, das einzige zur öffnende Fenster ist im Bad, durch das die Küchengerüche hereinzogen. Das Frühstück wird in Buffetform serviert. Kaffee kann man sich aus dem Nespresso Automaten ziehen. Nachhaltigkeit?",2,2023,06,23
233,Schrecklich. Verstehe die guten Bewertungen nicht!,"Es scheint davon abzuhängen, in welcher Etage man ein Zimmer bekommt. Ansonsten kann ich mir beim besten Willen nicht die vielen guten (v.a. auf booking.com) und sehr guten Bewertungen erklären. Unser Besuch im Ariel House war von vorne bis hinten ziemlich schrecklich. Einzige 2 Ausnahmen sind das Frühstück (samt neuem und modernem, hellen Frühstücksraum) und die Matratzen. Ansonsten kamen wir uns, auch was die Beschreibung des Zimmers angeht, veräppelt vor. Meine Fotos zeigen den Zustand des Zimmers und Hotels. Das Hotel ist total überteuert. Das mag an Dublin liegen. Aber für das Geleistete ist es geradezu albern. Es gibt viel zu wenige (und teilweise sehr enge) Parkplätze. Auf der Straße gibt es KEINE kostenlose Parkplätze. Direkt beim Reinkommen muss man zahlen, sehr eigenartig. Nicht mal das Zimmer gesehen, direkt ""wie wollen Sie zahlen?"". Dann ging es ab eine Etage runter, die Rezeption ist sozusagen Hochpaterre/1. Stock. Kaum unten angekommen, kam uns der muffige, feuchte Kellergeruch (wie bei Oma) entgegen. Ziemlich unangenehm. Desto weiter wir im langen, unfreundlichen, ollen Gang nach hinten zu unserem Zimmer gingen, desto schlimmer wurde dieser Geruch. Auch im Zimmer roch es danach. Unser Zimmer sollte einen ""Gartenblick"" haben. Der Bestand darin, dass wir vor einen Zaun schauten und um die Ecke ein wenig Gras sehen konnten. Ach, und ein schöner Parkplatz war noch zu sehen. Lächerlich. Der Türgriff fiel fast ab, es fehlten Glühbirnen im Bad, es gibt viele Flecken auf dem Teppich, alles wirkt abgewohnt. Das Fenster lässt sich  nicht wirklich öffnen (was natürlich in Anbetracht des Geruchs wirklich schlimm war), nur ein kleineres oberes Fenster ließ sich leicht kippen. Im Bad roch es schlecht, die Seiten der Badewanne fielen fast ab, der Klorollenhalter war total verrostet und wackelig usw. usf (siehe Fotos). Die wechselnden Herren an der Rezeption waren mehr mit ihrem Handy beschäftigt, konnten gerade mal so grüßen. Der Frühstücksraum dürfte, wenn das Hotel ausgebucht ist, viel zu klein sein. Andere Bewertungen sprechen davon, dass man warten musste. Das ist uns erspart geblieben. Der Raum ist schön hell, eine Art Wintergarten. Die Angestellten waren freundlich. Bei uns kam das Frühstück schnell. Die Kaffeemaschine ist nervig, es gibt auch nur sehr kleine Tassen. Es bilden sich Schlangen. Das Speisenangebot am Buffet ist sehr gering. Aber die frischen Speisen sind gut. Schön ist der Aufenthaltsraum oben, der sehr irisch (fast britisch) wirkt. Dort kann man sich zwar Tee zubereiten, aber das Wasser war fast immer kalt (man muss dann erst Bescheid sagen), und Kuchen. Hier kann man nett sitzen, den Tag planen. Das Hotel liegt einigermaßen gut. man kommt mit Bussen gut ins Zentrum. Das Hotel (es ist kein B&B, total unpersönlich) liegt DIREKT am Stadium. Könnte mir vorstellen, dass es dort sehr busy wird, wenn ein Spiel stattfindet. Ich würde niemals wieder buchen. Der Preis ist viel zu hoch, das Geleistete viel zu schlecht. Mag sein, dass es in den oberen Etagen schönere Zimmer gibt, wir hatten ein schreckliches, und haben ja trotzdem nicht weniger bezahlt. Ich hatte sogar extra über die Seite des HOtels gebucht (und nicht booking.com) in der Hoffnung, ein besseres Zimmer zu bekommen. Weit gefehlt! Vielleicht hat das Hotel eher Angst vor den booking.com-Bewertungen und gibt Menschen, die dort buchen, ein besseres Zimmer. Oder denjenigen, die länger bleiben - wir waren nur 2 Nächte dort (gottlob!). Nie mehr wieder. Da gibt es auch nur einen Stern für. Wer einen Eindruck bekommen will, sollte meine Fotos anschauen.

Wir hatten Glück, andere mussten warten, bis ein Tisch frei wurde. Nebenan ist direkt eine Dart Station, auch Bushaltestellen sind nicht weit entfernt.

Il quartiere dove si trova è residenziale, tranquillo e pulito. Ho solo belle parole da spendere per questa struttura, consigliata!",5,2022,09,10
233,Ottima scelta. Prenotate una partita allo stadio!,"Un adorabile b&b ubicato vicino allo stadio di rugby che vale la pena visitare. La zona è probabilmente la più costosa in cui vivere.

Los cuartos del hotel son muy comodos y bonitos, hay toallas limpias, tiene calefacción, Tiene estacionamiento gratuito, yo llegue en auto, lo deje estacionado y me fui a conocer Dublin en metro.

Le camere erano molto ampie con un bovindo delizioso dove sedersi e rilassarsi e anche i bagni erano molto grandi,caldi e forniti di tutto ok necessario!la sala colazione è un po' piccolina ma è davvero molto bella e la colazione è squisita,abbondante e molto varia!
L'hotel è leggermente defilato dal centro ma è talmente accogliente che è stato un piacere trovarsi in questo posto così tranquillo da vedere una volpe attraversare il giardino dell'Ariel house!!!il personale della reception è  davvero gentile e disponibile per qualsiasi necessità e sempre sorridente!sicuramente tornerò perché siamo state tutte davvero benissimo!",5,2019,01,29
233,"Elegante la struttura, ospitale lo staff.","Bellissima struttura nelle vicinanze del centro cittadino (circa 30 minuti a piedi) e adiacente allo stadio. Personale cordiale. Possibilità di gustare thè e dolciumi offerti nel salottino della struttura. 
La nostra stanza, una quadrupla, era veramente spaziosa e ben arredata; letti comodi ma piccoli.
Prima colazione veramente superlativa, la migliore gustata durante il nostro soggiorno irlandese! Ottima la Full Irish breakfast così come i pancake o i toast alla francese, tutti da ordinare alla carta e da implementare eventualmente, per i più golosi, col buffè di formaggi, dolci, yogurt, cereali, frutta, etc.
Da non sottovalutare la possibilità di parcheggio nello spazio antistante la struttura (una decina di posti auto).
Do quattro stelle e non cinque unicamente per il fatto che al nostro arrivo, alle 16.25, la stanza non era ancora pronta e abbiamo dovuto attendere nel salotto, dove ci è sono stati offerti thè e dolcini.
Ci tornerei comunque con grande piacere!",4,2019,01,06
233,Excelente ! El encanto de una elegante casa con el servicio de un gran hotel.,"Es un hotel con mucho encanto, te hace sentir parte de Dublín .
Muy bien  ubicado a 10’ andando del centro y a 20 metros de una parada de cercanías. 
La zona es muy bonita y tranquila . 
El personal es super agradable y el servicio es excepcional.
Las habitaciones muy amplias, con altos techos y camas confortables.,
El desayuno es magnífico ! Pastelería casera y menú a la carta.

233,Excelente hotel ,"Muy buenas habitaciones, desayuno fabuloso puedes pedir platos a la carta en el desayuno va incluido en el precio, cama muy cómoda y amplia, buena calefacción, habitacion enorme, por la tarde dan cafe, te,  pastas ,etc. Cuarto de baño con ducha y bañera, reponen todos los días gel, champoo y toallas.",5,2018,11,26
233,3 giorni a Dublino,"Consigliato a chi desidera assaporare l'atmosfera di una casa in stile vittoriano a Dublino. Il quartiere è residenziale e tranquillo. Con la linea DART si può raggiungere il centro della città in pochi minuti.
La nostra camera era enorme, una suite.
La sala delle colazioni è semplicemente deliziosa e la colazione è spettacolare, presentazione e qualità degne di un hotel 5 stelle.
Lo staff è cordiale e preciso, attento alle esigenze del cliente.
E' stato tutto perfetto!",5,2018,11,20
233,Un trato cálido y acogedor,"Nos recibieron con té y pastitas, amables y encantadores. El hotelito es de un estilo antiguo con decoración victoriana, el agua caliente funciona de maravilla, la calefacción también. El salón del piano es muy acogedor e invita a pasar el rato en compañía. Los desayunos son realmente estupendos, servidos en un comedor pequeño y encantador con ventanales al pequeño jardín.",5,2018,10,22
233,VIAGGIO CON AMICI,"ottimo posto abbastanza vicino al centro e facilmente raggiungibile anche con i mezzi, dispone di un piccolo parcheggio. colazioni ricche ma bisogna sempre chiedere di rifornire il tavolo, la macedonia non freschissima.ampie camere confortevoli",4,2018,09,17
233,La gentilezza del personale di questa guest House fa davvero la differenza!,"Siamo stati 2 giorni in questa guest House e siamo stati accolti davvero con grande gentilezza. Ottima location, a 2 passi dal treno che con 2 fermate ti porta nel cuore di Dublino, le camere sono davvero belle e accoglienti.
Un grosso grazie a Cecilia e Team. Consiglio a tutti vivamente questa guest House",5,2018,08,31
233,Lovely B&B,"Gutes B&B an ruhiger Lage, ca. 20Min. Zu Fuss vom Zentrum. Das Personal ist sehr nett und hilfsbereit und das Frühstück sensationell. Unser Zimmer war etwas nüchtern und die Polstermöbel schmuddelig. Bedingt durch das alte Gemäuer auch sehr ringhörig. Wir hörten jeden knarrenden Schritt von oben. Bad war klitzeklein und bot kaum Ablage aber sauber.",4,2018,07,20
233,"Wunderbares Frühstück; altehrwürdiges, tolles Gebäude; Top Kaffee !!","Wir waren dort für 3 Nächte während es in Dublin sehr heiß war. Leider war keine Klimaanlage in den Zimmern vorhanden.
Das Frühstück war hervorragend, Die Frische, die Qualität, fast alles selbst gemacht und nicht zu vergessen das Frühstückszimmer selbst mit dem freundlichen Service. 
Leider ist es uns an einem Tag passiert dass wohl der Großteil der Gäste direkt nach uns frühstücken wollte und wir zwar nett aber bestimmt, nach Beendigung des Frühstückes des Raumes gebeten wurden. (Grund zur Abwertung des Gesamteindruckes)=> Wir hätten gerne noch in Ruhe eine weitere Tasse Kaffee getrunken.
Unser Zimmer im Anbau war leider etwas abgewohnt, speziell das Bad, und sollten mal renoviert werden. Das Bett klapperte mit dem Kopfteil an der Wand und die Fenster liessen sich nur schwer öffnen. Aber fairerweise möchte ich erwähnen, das das gesamte Haus sehr sauber und rein ist und das Personal sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit ist.",4,2018,06,11
233,Buen hotel aunque poco céntrico ,"Es un hotel cómodo junto al Aviva Stadium, con una estructura típica irlandesa y donde el alojamiento es muy confortable. El único problema es que está alejado del centro aunque se puede ir en tren o incluso dar un largo paseo ",4,2018,04,11
233,Gut aufgehoben,"Hier, im Ariel House ist man gut aufgehoben, definitive!
Der viktorianische Stil des Ariel House hat uns bei der Buchung angesprochen - also nichts wie hin und gebucht.
Wir wurden nicht enttäuscht: Das Ariel House entspricht voll und ganz.
Heimelig und wohnlich mit Atmosphäre wie es so schön heißt.
Der Manager, Rory Doyle begrüßt persönlich, frägt nach unseren Wünschen und erklärt und gibt Auskünfte. Das Einparken mit dem geliehenen BMW-Rechtslenker in die enge Parklücke ist für uns ""Linkslenker"" nicht einfach - Mr. Doyle sieht´s und ist sofort zur Stelle - Parken, für ihn eine Kleinigkeit (wie für uns am Kontinent halt mit Linkslenkern).
Die Ausstattung der Zimmer nicht übermäßig aber zweckmäßig und vollkommen ausreichend.
Alles ist sehr sauber und ordentlich.
Das Frühstück ganz hervorragend.
Bei unserem nächsten Dublin-Aufenthalt kommen wir wieder - definitive!!",5,2018,04,02
233,Enamorados/as de este B&B,"Llegamos a Dublin el miércoles santo sin un alojamiento donde dormir (por culpa de una casa de Airbnb), a las 12 de la noche y, de los 10 hoteles a los que llamamos, fue el único que nos acogió (10 personas). 

La estancia fue mágica. El hotel es muy acogedor y está en un barrio muy tranquilo y bueno. El personal muy amable y atento en todo momento. Las camas eran muy cómodas, las habitaciones muy limpias y es desayuno espectacular. Tenían un buffet frío con pan de espelta, de plátano, cereales... Y una carta de platos calientes incluídos en el precio, con comida típica del país. 

Un sitio con mucho encanto y a solo 20-25 min andando del centro de Dublin. 

Si volvemos a Dublin, repetiremos seguro. Experiencia de 10!",5,2018,04,02
233,Nacho Nacho ,"Gute Atmosphäre und echt leckere Nachos. Die werden schön zurecht gemacht, mit Fleisch belegt und Käse überbacken, top Qualität. Das Personal ist freundlich wie fast überall in den Phillipinen :) direkt am Meer ",5,2017,11,27
233,Urige Unterkunft mit phänomenalem Frühstück,"Das in einem viktorianischen Haus betriebene B & B befindet sich im Bezirk Ballsbridge. Das Zentrum kann man von hier unproblematisch zu Fuß erreichen. Stadion, Herbert-Park und verschiedene Restaurants sind gleich um die Ecke. Die Einrichtung ist shabby chic und passt zum Alter des Hauses. Die Zimmer und Badezimmer sind allerdings etwas abgewohnt.

Das Frühstück ist jedoch absolut überragend. Potato cakes, organic smoked salmon und french toast mit Blaubeeren,,,yummy!",4,2017,10,01
233,Estancia muy agradable,"Las instalaciones están sumamente cuidadas, y son de un sofisticado estilo victoriano. El personal es muy amable, destacando la recepcionista, Bríd McAuliffe, que ha satisfecho nuestras dudas sobre sitios para ver y transportes siempre con una sonrisa. Los desayunos son espectaculares. Lo recomiendo totalmente.",5,2017,08,10
233,"Wunderschönes Hotel, angenehmes Ambiente mit bestem Frühstück","Wir verbrachten 3 Nächte im Ariel House. Man fühlt sich willkommen bereits bei der Ankunft. Im Drawing Room kann man am Nachmittag gratis Tee und Kaffee geniessen mit kleinen Kuchen. Dieses Angebot wird rege genutzt. Das Frühstück ist einfach sensationell. Man wählt zuerst einen Starter und danach das eigentliche Frühstück aus der Küche aus einer grossen Auswahl. Auch am Buffet kann man sich bedienen, hat aber schon fast keinen Hunger mehr. Das Brot ist selbergebacken und sehr lecker. 
Mit dem Zug ab Lansdowne Road ist man schnell am Conolly Bahnhof.
Das Aviva Stadium ist nur einen Steinwurf entfernt, hat aber nicht gestört. Wir erlebten ein Spiel am Samstag. Dieses begann aber bereits um 17:15 h und war um 20:00 h bereits wieder zu Ende. Es war eindrücklich zu sehen, welche Völkerwandung Richtung Stadium unterwegs war, aber alles ruhig und gesittet.
Der einzige negative Punkt ist der TV. Dieser hat schon bessere Tage gesehen und sollte ersetzt werden.",5,2017,08,09
233,Hotel da sogno,Dopo aver dormito in ostelli dove adattarsi è stata una necessità...finalmente un hotel! La struttura è di charme con un servizio eccellente dall'arrivo alla partenza. Le stanze sono ampie e dotate di tutti i comfort. I letti ...enormi. I bagni grandi e corredati di tutto. La colazione ottima ed abbondante.,5,2017,07,21
233,Super Hotel,Ruhig und trotzdem zentral gelegenenes Hotel. Mit dem Zug ist man in 10 Minuten im Zentrum Dublins. Sehr Hilfsbereites Personal. Schöne und saubere Zimmer mit gut eingerichtetem Badezimmer. Leckeres und reichhaltiges Frühstücksbüffet. Wir würden das nächste Mal für eine Bleibe in Dublin nicht lange studueren und wieder ins Ariel House gehen.,5,2017,07,16
233,Correcto,"Casa victoriana correcta.
Habitaciones correctas, poco amplias.
Sala de desayuno poco amplio para los clientes que tiene el hotel. Camareros agobiados por limpiar mesas ante la poca capacidad de la sala.
Desayuno correcto.
Sala de estar pequeña. Ubicación alejada del centro para ir andando. Francamente, viajo mucho y es la primera vez que observo un hotel correcto en un ranking de hoteles tan alto. Francamente, no lo entiendo. Estuve antes, por motivos familiares en otro hotel en Dublin en pleno centro con unas prestaciones mejores, y en el ranking aparece en los puestos 30 a 40. Recomendable por su tranquilidad en un barrio elegante. Ustedes mismos...",3,2017,05,16
233,St. Patricks Day & Geburtstag,"Es war wunderschön im Ariel House.
Außerordentlich hilfsbereite Inhaberin (Vielen Dank für alles, Jennie) und Mitarbeiter, die alles getan haben, dass wir einen unvergesslichen Aufenthalt in Dublin hatten. Superleckeres Frühstück, leider waren wir nicht lange genug da, um alles zu probieren ☺️.
Die Zimmer waren sehr schön eingerichtet (""antike"" Möbel), so dass man sich sofort heimisch gefühlt hat. Ruhige, aber gut angebundene Lage, 2 Minuten von der S-Bahn-Station entfernt.
Ich würde jederzeit wieder Ariel House buchen, leider habe ich einen kleinen Hund, den ich nicht mitbringen darf... vielleicht ändern sich die Hausregel irgendwann, ansonsten hat sich die liebe Cecilia angeboten, meinen Theo bei sich privat ""aufzunehmen"" 😉
Herzlichen Dank und liebe Grüße 
Stephanie Goger und Familie ",5,2017,03,29
233,Caratteristico,"Ariel House è un hotel caratteristico, con persone squisite e un'ottima colazione al mattino. Logisticamente ottimo per chi desidera andare all'Aviva Stadium (6 nazioni), o per chi deve lavorare tra gli uffici di Google o Facebook.
Se amate camminare, 20 minuti dal Trinity o 30 da Temple Bar.",4,2017,02,23
233,Mejor que un hotel,Estancia maravillosa en un Hotel tipo pensión de lujo. Todas las noches cuando llegábamos nos preparaban té con pastas. El personal y el desayuno excelentes. Las habitaciones muy completas y confortables. No muy alejado del centro,5,2016,12,09
233,AMBIENTE CONFORTABLE Y BUEN TRATO,ambiente con mucho estilo y cuidadoso. el personal muy amable y pendiente. el desayuno perfecto variado y casero. camas cómodas y habitación con wiffi. no muy alejado del centro comercial y temple bar. repetiría siempre allí.,5,2016,12,09
233,Favoloso riferimento....,"Favoloso riferimento per le future visite a Dublino.. posto molto gradevole e tipico irlandese. Munito di piccolo parcheggio. La struttura si trova a circa 20 min a piedi dal centro. Immediatamente dietro lo stadio. Il quartiere è elegante e tranquillo. Le stanze sono enormi e comode. Munito dei principali confort. Colazione servita in un bellissimo patio. In più c è un ""salottino"" con a disposizione te e biscotti. Il prezzo è buono rispetto ad altri posti. Ottimo quindi il rapporto qualita/prezzo... ahhh.. ci tornerei volentieri ",4,2016,12,06
233,Un Irish break ,"Ya venia sobre seguro, el Ariel House es muy recomendable.El ambiente de otros tiempos se mantiene con mucho gusto y gracia en los detalles decorativos, desde los espejos de cuerpo entero o las perchas en los pasillos para dejar el sombrero.
La atmósfera es placentera y sirve de soporte al trato que todo el personal ofrece al huesped.Los desayunos variados, puedes elegir entre diferentes alternativas para empezar bien el dia. Quiero destacar lo bien que se está en la sala del viejo piano, sentado en uno de los sillones, mirando a través de sus ventanales y con la permanente tentación de café, té y  pastitas.
Lo único que creo que deberían observar es el servicio de arreglo de habitaciones que debería ser mas diligente.
Bueno que muy a gusto he pasado estos cuatro días.",4,2016,11,10
233,Clásica casa de huespedes,"Esta casa de huéspedes tiene unas instalaciones anticuadas, pero la amabilidad del personal suple estas deficiencias. Sin ser demasiado céntrico, tiene una buena ubicación para realizar una visita a Dublín.
Lo mejor: El desayuno y la amabilidad.
Lo peor: Los colchones
",5,2016,11,09
233,Gutes Hotel mit leckerem Full Irish Breakfast!,"Unbedingt Zimmer im Obergeschoss nach hinten raus buchen, dann ist es angenehm ruhig. Die Bäder sind mini und auch die Betten brauchten eine Überholung. Personal ist super nett und echt auf Zack! Parkplätze kostenlos vor dem Haus aber enge Kiste!",4,2016,11,04
233,"Grandi colazioni, piccole camere ...","La nostra stanza, benché pulita e ben arredata, non somigliava affatto a quella fotografata nel sito di presentazione. Era piccola e con bagno senza finestra. Anche la finestra della stanza non era apribile senza far scattare l'allarme, salvo un piccolo finestrino che permetteva l'accesso ad un filo d'aria. Insomma una mezza delusione compensata solo dalla bontà e varietà delle colazioni che alzano il livello complessivo di valutazione. Gradevole il servizio sempre con il sorriso.",4,2016,11,01
233,Eccezionale,"Ottimo hotel, ben collegato al centro grazie al treno (stazione a 5 minuti a piedi). Camere pulite e ben arredate. Personale gentilissimo e disponibile, colazioni ottime con un piccolo buffet ed il resto da scegliere dal menù alla carta... che abbuffate, abbondantissimo. Perché 4stelle è non 5? Manca l'ascensore, noi eravamo al piano -1 ed erano pochi scalini, ma per arrivare ai piani alti ce ne sono da fare tanti e sono stretti.
",4,2016,10,28
233,Mancanza di sevizi,"Potrebbe essere un buon posto ma purtroppo per invalidi con problemi motori non è da consigliare..... scalinata all entrata Hotel ascensore assente  .... 
letti scomodi , bagno con piastrelle molto scivolose , doccia assente ..... ",3,2016,10,17
233,"Ottimo, come da aspettative","Abbiamo soggiornato in questa Townhouse purtroppo solo per una notte, ma non possiamo proprio lamentarci. L'edificio è stupendo, proprio in stile vittoriano e l'arredamento è di classe. Camere grandi e puliti, staff gentile sia alla reception che alla colazione... colazione appunto da favola, con buffet abbondante e menù alla carta con l'imbarazzo della scelta. L'unica pecca, se così vogliamo chiamarla, era la distanza dal centro, in quanto essendo Dublino una capitale in cui è facile raggiungere tutto a piedi, da Ariel House (che si trova sotto lo stadio) bisogna prendere il treno per un paio di fermate. Lo consiglio vivamente cmq!",4,2016,08,26
233,Colonizzatore,La struttura è ottima ben pulita e ordinata. La posizione ê buona vicino alla fermata della metro. Le camere e i bagni sono grandi. La colazione ottima e varia. Le ragazze sono tutte molto gentili. Segnale Wi-Fi buono. Insomma niente ê lasciato al caso. La consiglio sicuramente,5,2016,08,15
233,Sehr empfehlenswert.,"Wir hatten ein Standardzimmer im Erdgeschoss, Hauptgebäude mit Fenster zur Straße. Dieses war groß (ca. 25 m²) mit antiken Möbeln und ganz neuem großzügigen Bad. Das Haus erweckt, nicht zuletzt wegen der knarrenden Dielen von den darüber liegenden Zimmern, den Eindruck als würde man in einem Schloss / Herrenhaus wohnen. Der Empfang war herzlich und man wurde durch das stets aufmerksame Personal mit Tee und frisch gebackenen Scones und Bananenbrot im Drawing Room versorgt. Das WLAN ist bestens. Das absolute Highlight ist jedoch das Frühstück mit einem umfangreichen Angebot an Cerealien, Selbstgebackenem und mehreren frisch zubereiteten und individuell auswählbaren warmen Speisen (Full Breakfast, Pancakes, Rührei mit Lachs usw.) welches in einem Wintergarten ähnlichen Raum serviert wird. Ein toller Start in den Morgen.",5,2016,07,31
233,Un soggiorno con carattere,"Stanca delle grandi catene, ho scelto una townhouse, per un soggiorno più irish. 
Elegante palazzina, stanza grande e spaziosa arredata old stile (unico rammarico i due letti separati uno singolo e uno di fatto da una piazza e mezzo che loro definiscono 'matrimoniale'), bagno pulito, ottima colazione a la carte, bella sala con divani e bevande/dolcetti per la merenda, personale gioviale e disponibile.
La distanza dal centro c'è, ma se si fa l'abbonamento ai trasporti per 3 gg (comprendente anche il tragitto da/per l'aeroporto) non la si sente.
Non è un hotel 5 stelle ma si sta benissimo!",5,2016,07,26
233,Agradable y tranquilo,"Hemos pasado una semana muy agradable y feliz en este hotel tipo casa, muy bonita, con muchos detalles, tranquila, y el personal super respetuoso y educado. El desayuno que teniamos dudas por algunos comentarios nos encanto!! Esta algo alejado del centro pero bien comunicado y si os gusta caminar se puede ir dando un paseo. Coincidió mi cumpleaños allí y me sorprendieron con un pastel con su vela, una postal y todo el comedor se puso a cantarme el cumpleaños feliz, todo un detalle que agradezco y recordaré siempre. Sin duda si algún día volvemos a Irlanda repetiremos",5,2016,07,26
233,Empfehlenswert,Ein sehr empfehlenswertes Haus im englischen Stil. Ein gemütliches Haus mit ausgesprochen freundlichem und zuvorkommenden Personal. Saubere Zimmer guter service und Frühstück. Durch Bahnnähe gute Anbindung zum Centrum,5,2016,07,24
233,Durchschnittliches Hotel mit sehr gutem Frühstück,"Unser Doppelzimmer war recht groß, leider zu Lasten des Badezimmers, das leider mini war. Zimmer war schon abgewohnt aber sehr sauber. Ein Highlight und total positive Überraschung war das Frühstück. Ein Genuss mit sehr gutem Service. Alles im allem ein mittelmäßiges Hotel mit sehr gutem Frühstück und Service. Lage des Hotels nicht unmittelbar im Zentrum. Gehzeit ins Zentrum beträgt ca. 15-20 Minuten. ",3,2016,07,13
233,..schöne Eröffnung unserer Irlandreise...,"Auch wir waren von diesem kleinen Hotel  begeistert.Der Empfang war herzlich und unser Zimmer in der Parterre entsprach weitgehend unseren Erwartungen.Die Betten waren etwas kurz und schmal, war für grössere Gäste sicher ein Problem sein kann.Der neu verlegte Teppich sorgte durch seine Höhe für ein paar Schreckmomente beim Versuch aus dem Bad ins Zimmer zurückzukehren;doch sollte dies mit Hilfe eines Schreiners sich schnell lösen lassen. Das Frühstück war sehr ordentlich und liess keine Wünsche offen.Der kostenlose Parkplatz vor dem Hotel war sehr willkommen. Die Nähe der S-Bahn (Stop Lansdowne Road) ist bei der dezentralen Lage des Hotels ein Vorteil, da man mit zwei Stops mitten in der Innenstadt ist. Doch VORSICHT: nicht jede S-Bahn hält an der Lansdown Road ; bei unserer Rückfahrt sind wir aus Versehen in einen Zug gestiegen, der erst 10 Stationen später das erste Mal gehalten hat. Nach Rückfrage bei einheimischen Mitreisenden handelt es sich dabei um eine ""Intercity S-Bahn"" (keinerlei Hinweis beim Einstieg..), was uns fast eine Stunde extra Reisezeit kostete.",4,2016,07,09
233,Es wurde schon alles gesagt,"Ich kann hier nur die Meinungen der anderen wiederholen. Vom Zimmer über Frühstück zum Personal alles top. Es gibt sicherlich Hotels welche näher am Zentrum liegen, aber man ist mit dem Taxi oder der DART Line in wenigen Minuten da.",5,2016,05,11
233,Nicest place,"Eines der schönsten und willkommensten Hotels wo ich je war! Absolut empfehlenswert und a must go! Das Frühstück, der Service und die Zimmer sind absolut begehrenswert und das herzliche Klima wird einen schier umhauen! Auch das kleine Drumherum mit Gebäck und Kaffee und Tee im Foyer, was bis spät in die Nacht zur Verfügung steht, ist absolut stunning! ",5,2016,05,02
233,Como en casa,"El hotel es un B&B de lujo, está emplazado una casona muy acogedora, en los al rededores de Dublín. Cuenta con estacionamiento gratuito. En el living con chimenea y piano de cola siempre hay té y delicias para comer mientras llega la hora de comida. El personal es muy amable y servicial. Las habitaciones son amplias. Decoración elegante y adecuada a una casona antigua. No hay ascensor, y si tienes equipaje pesado, eso puede ser un problema ya que acceder a las habitaciones requiere subir y bajar escaleras. El desayuno está incluido y es delicioso y abundante, con preparaciones de platos especiales por un chef y servidos en un comedor muy agradable con vista a un lindo jardín. Recomiendo el salmón fresco ahumado con pan negro y huevo poché.
El precio-calidad es muy adecuado. Te sientes como en casa. Volveré a ir de todas maneras, y lo recomiendo si la idea es ir a descansar a un lugar de confort pero no extremadamente elegante o concurrido y que está cercano en transporte público o privado al centro de la ciudad.",5,2016,04,30
233,Il meglio del meglio,"La struttura si trova nel quartiere di Ballsbridge a 20' di cammino dal centro, in una casa georgiana magnifica. La pulizia è impeccabile, così come la gentilezza e la disponibilità del personale. Sopra ogni aspettativa (già molto alta prima di partire leggendo le altre recensioni di Tripadvisor) la colazione; un buffet ricco ma la differenza è nel menu dei piatti express che si posso ordinare, dai pancake dolci alla tipica colazione irlandese. Straconsigliato",5,2016,04,25
233,Semana Santa en Familia,"Estuvimos en dos habitaciones dobles de la planta baja un matrimonio con dos hijos. El hotel está en una zona muy tranquila y a unos 30 minutos andando del ayuntamiento en el centro de la ciudad. Los desayunos geniales y la limpieza también. Volvería a hospedarme si volviese de nuevo a Dublín. Lo único negativo a destacar es que mi habitación estaba debajo de la sala de estar donde se servían tes, cafés y pastas y por la noche se escuchaban las pisadas de los huespedes que se paseaban por dicha sala. Por todo lo demás una estancia muy feliz.",4,2016,04,01
233,A 5 Stelle!,Siamo stati in questo posto grazie alle splendide recensioni osservate su trip e posso tranquillamente confermare quanto letto! L'ambiente è davvero molto elegante con un servizio davvero impeccabile e una qualità sopra la media di tutto quello che ho avuto il piacere di assaggiare. Da segnalare il pancake: delizioso. Manager molto disponibile e simpatica .. complimenti!  ,5,2016,03,24
233,colazioni da Sogno!,"Vicino allo stadio Aviva, in zona residenziale molto tranquilla, ma comodo anche al centro che si raggiunge con piacevole passeggiata di una ventina di minuti.tipico palazzo in stile vittoriano, molto bello. La mia stanza era un po piccola e buia ma per il tempo trascorso e andata bene così. Ricordo una colazione ottima,  varia e abbondante. Lo consiglio per un soggiorno a Dublino.",4,2015,11,19
233,Wunderschön,"Das alt ehrwürdige Haus hat seinen Charme, die Zimmer sind sehr schön und stilvoll eingerichtet. Das Frühstück ist der absolute Wahnsinn. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich. Man kann kostenlos am oder hinter dem Hotel parken. In wenigen Minuten ist man mit der Dart-Linie im Zentrum Dublins. Ich freue mich schon auf unseren nächsten Besuch dort. Wir haben das Guest-House im August 2014 besucht.",5,2015,09,11
233,Bellissima struttura.,"Bellissima casa vittoriana. Stanza grande e soprattutto ben pulita. Personale gentile. All'esterno abbellito con fiori freschi. Vicinissimo alla Dart (circa 200 metri). Ho soggiornato qui per 4 notti e sicuramente ci tornerei. Avrei dato 5  se fosse stato più centrale. Sono circa 2,5 km dal centro e a piedi è un pò lontano. ",4,2015,08,28
233,Nicht im Zentrum aber Spitze,"Empfohlen auf Tripadvisor und all die guten Kritiken habe ich bestätigt gefunden. Die Buchung über booking.com günstig und klaglos. Der Empfang besonders freundlich und kompetent. Das "" Wohnzimmer "" wo Tee und Kuchen angeboten werden ist gemütlich und stilvoll, ideal am Abend noch die Zeitung zu lesen. Mein Zimmer ,sehr ruhig und komplett ausgestattet. Das Frühstück ,ein wahrer Traum für Liebhaber einer ausgiebigen Morgemahlzeit. Sehr empfehlenswert !!",5,2015,08,24
233,GOOD LOCATION,"Buona posizione ed eccellente colazione, una delle migliori che io abbia mai provato. 
Accogliente living room, con tea, caffè e dolci sempre a disposizione per gli ospiti a qualsiasi ora del pomeriggio. Consigliato, sicuramente io ritornerei. Comodissimo all'Aviva stadium (nazionale di rugby), ed alla dart (treno) che porta sia in centro (due fermate) che sulla costa a Howt (escursione consigliatissima, sono le scogliere di Dublino con dei meravigliosi percorsi a piedi, il più lungo di 12 km). Da provare anche l'Afternoon tea, su prenotazione il sabato o la domenica pomeriggio, costa eur 20 a persona ma veramente eccellente sia per qualità che per quantità.",5,2015,08,21
233,"Agradable, tranquilo y económico","Típica casa adosada de Dublín. Tranquilo, limpio y buen servicio. Desayuno (no buffet) correcto. Algo alejado del centro turístico pero bien comunicado por metro al centro de la ciudad y a pueblecitos cercanos en la costa",4,2015,08,10
233,scelta azzeccata,"posizione non proriamente centrale ma il centro di Dublino è raggiungibile in 2 fermate di draft , camere pulite e discretamente spaziose io ho soggiornato per 2 notti con una famiglia di 2 bimbi ,da segnalare la colazione veramente abbondante e con ampia scelta .
sicuramente da consigliare",4,2015,06,22
233,Tranquillo e bello,"Sono stato per tre notti in questa Gest House a Dublino devo dire che è molto suggeativa,  tipica casa in mattoncini rossi ambienti molto grandi e belli, sanno di vissuto. La camera che ho utiluzzato è la ""Orsar Wilde "" molto grande composta da due ambienti zona letto, con letto matrimoniale misura grande comodo e una zona con tv due poltrone e bollitore, non c'è il frigo bar se a qualcuno interessa. La camera si affaccia su un giardino privato, prato all'inglese piante e fiori. Il bagno è senza finestra ma ben fatto grande doccia vasca ad angolo lavandino. Il tutto pulito. Comodo da raggiungere con la Dart un treno di superfice due fermate e si è nella zona centrale. Non ho mai fatto la colazione perché a me e mia moglie piace girare ma ho letto che è molto buona. Se dovessi tornare a Dublino ci tornerei consigliato.",4,2015,06,03
233,Buona scelta,"Hotel molto carino, non proprio centrale ma con la fermata della DART a due passi. Personale veramente molto cortese, prima colazione eccellente. La stanza fronte strada un po' rumorosa, ma la cosa peggiore il bagno, praticamente senza riscaldamento, quindi gelido. Nel complesso una buona esperienza",4,2015,05,18
233,"""schlossiges"" Hotel nahe Aviva Stadium mit hervorragendem Frühstück","Wir verbrachten 5 Tage in Dublin, Stadtteil Ballsbridge und sind aufgrund der vielen positiven Bewertungen auf dieses Hotel aufmerksam geworden. Das Hotel macht von Außen einen sehr gepflegten Endruck und das Entrée führt den Reisenden direkt zur Rezeption. Besonders das Servicepersonal und das Frühstück sind ein mehr als positiver Start in den Tag. Die Räumlichkeiten zeigen den für uns typischen irischen Stil, mit hochfloorigen Teppichen 
und entsprechenden Einrichtungsgegenständen. Die Zimmer sind ausreichend möbliert und die Nachtlager sehr bequem. Das Reinigungspersonal ist leider nicht so umsichtig, wie das andere Servicepersonal, da doch öfters vergessen wird, die Standardausrüstung aufzufüllen. Fazit: Das Hotel ist sehr empfehlenswert. Man sollte aber gut zu Fuß sein, da die Verkehrsmittel in der Umgebung (bis auf die Eisenbahn) einen gewissen Weg erfordern.",4,2015,05,10
233,SENSAZIONALE,"Mia moglie ed io abbiamo alloggiato in questa fantastica guesthouse 4 giorni. Sensazionale l'accoglienza dello staff, colazione eccellente, camere accoglienti e pulite. La struttura vicinissima alla stazione della DART per cui collegata egregiamente al centro di Dublino.
In occasione del compleanno di mia moglie lo staff si è dimostrato molto carino nel preparare del prosecco e delle candeline a colazione. GRAZIE PER LA BELLISSIMA ACCOGLIENZA E COMPLIMENTI PER LA GENTILEZZA E CORDIALITÀ' DELLO STAFF. Un ringraziamento speciale ad ANNA ed EWA per l'estrema gentilezza e disponibilità.",5,2015,04,20
233,Einer der schönsten Städtetrips überhaupt - mit einer super netten Unterkunft,"Wir haben dort einen runden Geburtstag meines Mannes gefeiert (Februar 2012, leider lässt sich das unten nicht mehr angeben). Ich hatte es vorher angekündigt und Champus sowie Blumen bestellt. Und sie haben mir auch noch angeboten einen Kuchen zu organisieren. Letzter war dann von der Besitzerin selbst gebacken, wunderschön dekoriert und unglaublich lecker (Schokokuchen)!!! Während wir frühstückten, bauten die Ladies alles im Zimmer auf. Es war für meinen Mann der schönste Geburtstag überhaupt. 

Wir hatten das große Zimmer unten mit dem Erker, das war natürlich auch noch einmal fantastisch. Es gab ein riesiges Bad (allerdings nicht modern) und ein Himmelbett. Das gesamte Haus hat einen unglaublichen Vintage-Charme. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt.

Das Guesthouse ist zwar vom Zentrum relativ weit weg, wir sind trotzdem immer gelaufen. Da es nah an der S-Bahn liegt, konnten wir auch sehr schöne Ausflüge unternehmen. Außerdem sind touristenfreie Pubs und Restaurants relativ in der Nähe.",5,2015,03,29
233,Sehr nettes Bed & Breakfast Hotel,"Bei unserer Ankunft gleich die erste Überraschung - ein Upgrade in eine Junior-Suite. Diese war recht groß und vor allem das Bad sehr geräumig. Das Hotel und die Zimmer sind mit antiken Möbeln ausgestattet, wobei die Matratze (meines Erachtens in einem Hotel das wichtigste Detail) sehr bequem war. Obwohl wir sehr große Fenster Richtung Süden hatten, konnte man durch die schweren Vorhänge das Zimmer komplett abdunkeln.
Das Frühstück - für welches das Hotel schon mehrfach ausgezeichnet wurde - war auch für uns ein morgendliches Ereignis. Es gibt ein kleines Buffet, die warmen Sachen (z.B. poached eggs with salmon or bacon) bestellt man frisch bei dem überaus aufmerksamen Personal. Beim Kaffee hatte man zwar keine Auswahl, d.h. es gab nur Filterkaffee, aber dies ist mir keinen Punktabzug wert.
Die Lage des Hotels ist eigentlich auch recht gut - in ca. 100m Entfernung ist die nächste DART-Station, allerdings kann man die 1,5km zum Zentrum (Trinity-College usw.) auch gut zu Fuss gehen.
Alles in allem ein gelungener Aufenthalt und nur zu empfehlen.",5,2015,03,24
233,Bella guesthouse in stile vittoriano. Colazione sublime,"Ci siamo serviti di questa guesthouse durante il nostro soggiorno a Dublino, si trova nei pressi dell'Aviva Stadium e a 20 minuti a piedi dal centro città. Le camere sono confortevoli e pulite. Sicuramente degna di nota la colazione che oltre ad un buffet prevede numerosissime scelte da menù. Il tutto preparato al momento. Consigliatissima",4,2014,12,30
233,"comodo, silenzioso","accanto alla fermata della DART dello stadio (3 da Temple bar), con parcheggio privato. camera enorme, fronte strada ma silenzioso. colazione abbondante in una bella veranda. 110 euro a notte. wifi gratuito",5,2014,11,28
233,Para volver,"Desde que llegamos la atención ha sido exquisita. Amabilidad y detalles en todo momento. Todo el personal te trata maravillosamente desde la recepción, comedor, etc.

Es un detalle el disponer de café, te y dulces durante todo el día en la habitación de la entrada. El desayuno a la carta es francamente delicioso.

La parada del bus para ir al aeropuerto (702) y para el centro están a 5 min. La parada del DART (cercanias) a 50m.

Seguro que volveremos........",5,2014,11,16
233,Magnifico hotel para un fin de semana largo,"Acabamos de volver de Dublin donde hemos pasado un fin de semana largo en este hotel.  Puedo confirmar todos los comentarios positivos sobre el hotel, tanto en relación a atención excelente, limpieza y comodidad de habitación, espectacular el desayuno, la tranquilidad del entorno, etc. Ibamos con niños y todo han sido facilidades. El hecho de que este alejado del centro no es ningún problema, la comunicación es muy buena y el coste de un taxi desde el centro es muy razonable, unos 8-10 euros.",5,2014,10,28
233,Klein und fein,"Super Hotel, sehr freundliches personal! Das Frühstück ist klasse und mit Liebe zum Detail serviert. wir würden wieder hier her kommen. Super Verkehrsanbindung, die nächste DART Stadion ist nur ca. 200m entfernt!",4,2014,10,10
233,Bel posto,"per una notte in viaggio di lavoro mi sono affidato alle recensioni di trip ed ho prenotato.
Mi son trovato bene, anche se il ranking migliore tra le soluzioni lusso rispetto a Four Seasons e Westin è un po' il limite dei confronti di Trip in generale.
Pur solo ho avuto una stanza doppia, piano terra terra (l'ingresso è sopra), giusta negli spazi, con tutto il necessario. 
Bagno recente (non banale in questo tipo di ambiente quando si viaggia in UK-IRL), nel senso che c'erano delle belle piastrelle e i sanitari compresi i rubinetti sono semi nuovi.Piccolo televisore con 10 canali. Tutto pulitissimo. Arredato con buon gusto anche nelle camere.

Il rapporto qualità prezzo è molto buono, la casa non è distante dal centro è dalla parte più recente dei sobborghi, davanti quasi lo stadio nuovo. Comoda la linea treni, DART, appena 30Mt che porta ovunque con 2EUR, non si sente con finestre chiuse.
Ovviamente essendo una guest house e non un albergo, non ci sono grandi cose da fare dentro se si esclude una buona lettura nel salotto comune. Wi-fi incluso.

Colazione adeguata, mediamente vario il buffet, ottima scelta di piatti caldi dalla cucina.
Personale tutto molto gentile e disponibile.",4,2014,10,08
233,Bello,"Per le ultime due notti del nostro viaggio in Irlanda abbiamo scelto di soggiornare all'Ariel house. Il b&b si trova a circa venti minuti a piedi dai maggiori punti d'interesse di dublino, raggiungibili anche con gli autobus 4 e 7. La stanza era molto grande e pulita. La colazione ottima con diverse possibilità di scelta. Ottimo il pancake scelto da mia moglie! Lo consiglio",4,2014,09,23
233,...impeccabile...,"...abbiamo piacevolmente soggiornato tre notti in una bella camera superior di questo piccolo albergo che si trova in una zona tranquilla di Dublino, il cui centro è comunque raggiungibile con un paio di fermate della  Dart la cui stazione è a soli due minuti a piedi dall'Ariel House...
...il personale è gentile e premuroso e la superlativa prima colazione viene servita in una luminosa veranda, con l'offerta di  un eccezionale buffet ed un'ampia scelta di piatti caldi perfettamente preparati...",5,2014,09,12
233,Ottima base a Dublino,"Ottimo albergo vicino all'Aviva Stadium, a pochi passi da una stazione della Dart a tre fermate da Temple Bar. Le camere sono silenziose, spaziose e pulite, i letti molto confortevoli. Salotto con camino per relax e lettura con libero servizio di té, caffé e dolcetti. Il personale molto gentile e premuroso, la colazione superlativa in parte a buffet e in parte a menú cucinata al momento. Parcheggio non molto grande ma ampia possibilità di parcheggio in zona",5,2014,09,05
233,Schön,"Das Hotel hat einen sehr sauberen UBS gepflegten Eindruck gemacht. Das personal war sehr nett und als ich nach einem Föhn gefragt habe da der vorinstallierte nicht funktionierte bekam ich einen neuen hingelegt. 
Das Frühstück war gut besonders der blueberry pancake. 
Im Aufenthaltsraum gibt EA Getränke und scones und andere Kleinigkeiten.
Dort darf man sich auch nach dem auschecken noch aufhalten und auch seine Sachen stehen lassen. 

Das Bett war ein wenig wackelig und es war warm im Zimmer aber die Dusche war in Ordnung. ",4,2014,09,03
233,Stile e cortesia,"Abbiamo alloggiato una sola notte all'Ariel House di Dublino ma ci è bastato per apprezzarne il servizio curato e ed elegante! Gli alloggi e le sale comuni sono spaziosi e ben tenuti, graziosissima la veranda luminosa della sala colazione, accogliente il salotto. Colazione ottima e disponibile sia a buffet che preparata al momento À la carte inclusa nel prezzo della camera. La distanza dal centro ci ha permesso di uscire a piedi, l hotel è comunque collegato dal treno fino alle  ore 23.
I titolari gentili ed efficienti. Insomma tutto benissimo!",5,2014,08,19
233,Un perfetto equilibrio tra tradizione e confort,"Questo piccolo elegante Hotel in puro stile Vittoriano nell'immediata periferia di Dublino (20 minuti a piedi da Trinity College)  offre al fortunato ospite camere dal gusto tipicamente ""vecchia Irlanda"" negli arredi, ma non disgiunto da ottimo e moderno confort.
Una super colazione in una veranda a vetri assai piacevole completa un giudizio veramente positivo",5,2014,07,31
233,Gute Lage,"Unser Zimmer war etwas duster, aber soweit in Ordnung. 
Die Mitarbeiter beim Frühstück waren sehr nett, die Pancakes super. Das Hotel liegt in einer netten Gegend, mit dem Bus ist man schnell im Zentrum.",4,2014,07,09
233,"verkehrsgünstig, alte Möbel nicht immer gleich antik","Wir hatten ein Zimmer im Paterre, gefühlt Souterain. Die Einrichtung war eher alt als antik.
Dafür war aber das Personal sehr freundlich und das Frühstück sehr gut und reichhaltig.
Insgesamt war es ok.",3,2014,06,09
233,Tolles Hotel in ruhiger Lage,"Wir wurden im Hotel sehr nett empfangen und bekamen ein grosses Famlienzimmer. Das Zimmer war gut eingerichtet, die Möbel eher älter, aber das passt bestens zum Stil des Hotels. Alles sehr sauber. Das Frühstück war das beste das wir in Irland hatten. Es gab feines, hausgemachtes Brot man konnte zudem aus der Frühstückskarte zusätzliche Speisen bestellen (Irish Breakfast, Rühreier usw.). Am Nachmittag konnte man Kaffee oder Tee und Kuchen  im Aufenthaltsraum geniessen. Das einzige Minuspunkt war das Badezimmer, dort war die Abdeckung der Badewanne ziemlich provisorisch und trotz einer Glasabdeckung hat man den Boden beim Duschen zum  Teil überschwemmt., aber das sind Kleinigkeiten. Das WLAN hat tip top funktioniert. Mit Bus oder Bahn gut zu erreichen. Das Taxi vom Flughafen hat 28 Euro gekostet. Ich würde Ariel House jedermann empfehlen.",5,2014,05,17
233,L'onesta',"Abbiamo prenotato questo hotel visto le lusinghiere recensioni apparse su tripadvisor. Purtroppo abbiamo dovuto disdire la prenotazione per motivi famigliari. Ebbene, nonostante il diritto di applicare la penale, perfettamente legittima, nulla ci e' stato addebitato, ed ogni contatto e' stato all'insegna della correttezza ed educazione. Chapeau, sono dei veri signori. Speriamo di vederci presto.",5,2014,03,19
233,Irlandese !,"Situato in un quartiere molto tranquillo ed elegante non distante dal centro di Dublino, facilmente raggiungibile a piedi passando per delle vie caratteristiche belle da percorrere a piedi.
  L Hotel è carino pulito è ben tenuto l'arredamento è molto irish ma a me è piaciuto, buona la colazione e mi sento di consigliarlo.",5,2014,02,03
233,Sehr schön :-),Das Ariel House an der Lansdowneroad ist ein uriges gemütliches Hotel.Die Zimmer sind großzügig mit zwei Betten sowie LCD und diversen Möbeln ausgestattet.Auch ein internes WLAN ist möglich. Das Frühstück ist reichhaltig und landestypisch. Die Bedinungen sind sehr freundlich und versuchen jeden Wunsch möglich zu machen. Keine 100m vom Hotel entfernet ist eine Tram (DART) Station von der man aus sehr schnell in die in Innenstadt Dublins gelangen kann.Wir können das Ariel House nur empfehlen und wird für unseren nächsten Besuch defintiv wieder unser Hotel.,5,2014,01,27
233,"Tolles, uriges Hotel","Wir hatten 5 tolle Tagen im Ariel House Dublin.

Das Hotel liegt ein kleines bisschen außerhalb, ist aber in 10 Minuten mit der Bahn oder ca 40 Minuten Fußweg vom Zentrum aus erreichbar. Es liegt ca 100 Meter neben dem Aviva Stadion und ist damit mit der Bahn perfekt zu erreichen. Solange keine Veranstaltung dort stattfindet, kann ich über die Lage auch nichts negatives sagen, denn die Gegend ist extrem ruhig.

Das Hotel ist wirklich so, wie es auf den Fotos aussieht! Hier wurde ein Herrenhaus zu einem Hotel umgebaut. Es ist extrem gemütlich und hat viele alte Elemente erhalten. Es ist aber auch sehr verwinkelt und es gibt an vielen Stellen Stufen zu diversen Anbauten, also sicherlich nicht für Rollstuhlfahrer geeignet.

Das Personal ist zu jederzeit super nett und freundlich gewesen. Die Fremdsprachenkenntnisse belaufen sich allerdings nur auf englisch, irisch und ein paar Brocken französisch, aber wer englisch beherrscht hat hier natürlich kein Problem.
Es gibt im ganzen Hotel kostenlos WLAN in allen Zimmern.

Unser Zimmer war super gemütlich eingerichtet, sodass wir uns sofort wohl gefühlt haben.
Da es ein altes Gebäude ist, muss man z.B. Abstriche bei der elektrischen Ausstattung machen. Es gab bei uns keine Zimmerbeläuchtung, sondern nur 2 kleine Tischlampen und 2 Lampen am Bett, die jeweils einzeln eingeschaltet werden mussten, was sogar extrem schwierig war, da die Lichtschalter sehr versteckt waren und auch erst nach minutenlanger Suche mit dem Hotelpersonal gefunden werden konnten! Und es gab im ganzen Zimmer auch nur eine freie Steckdose, was das aufladen zweier Handys und einer Kamera teilweise schon erschwert hat.
Das Bad war insgesamt zwar gut, es hatte aber den Nachteil, dass man beim Duschen in der Wanne, trotz eines Glasvorhangs das halbe Bad unter Wasser gesetzt hat und vor allem um die Toilette das Wasser stand.
Das Frühstück war typisch irisch mit einem kleinen Buffet und einer kleine Karte von der man sich warmes Esser bestellen konnte.
Durchgehend gab es in einem Raum in der Nähe der Rezeption Wasser, Wasser mit Zitronenscheiben und Kräutern, Kaffee und Tee sowie ab dem Nachmittag auch Kuchen, Gebäck, Plätzchen usw.

Insgesamt haben wir uns super wohl gefühlt und würde es jederzeit wieder buchen!",5,2013,12,29
233,molto irish,"A 20 min a piedi dal centro,in una zona molto tranquilla e residenziale.L'hotel è molto carino,le stanze semplicemente arredate ma pulite.Connessione wifi,salotto con caffè e dolcetti a disposizione degli ospiti.La sala x la colazione molto carina con vetrata,colazione abbondante,unica pecca poche cose dolci.camerieri molto gentili.",4,2013,12,13
233,Soggettivo,"La posizione dell'Ariel è comoda, nel senos che con il dard si raggiunge velocemente il centro, ed anche nel senso che la sua location è tranquilla,not noisy. La struttura è molto tipica, ma ad altri potrà magair apparire non adeguata alle 4 stelle. io ho trovato un'accoglienza garbata, una stanza arredata con severa sobrietà, non sgradevole. il breakfast altrettanto tipoco, e tipicamente    generoso.
Insomma, tutto accettabile.",3,2013,10,17
233,Wird meiner Meinung nach überschätzt,"Wurden leider von einer kühlen Blonden nur widerwillig empfangen. Diese ist zwar während unseres Aufenthaltes etwas aufgelebt, wir füllten uns aber kaum je wirklich willkommen. Aus Wünsche wurde nur langsam reagiert, z.B. umparkieren etc. Die Zimmer sind zwar relativ gross, aber überaus einfach eingerichtet. Der Stuhl war komplett durchgesessen, das Bett ziemlich schmal und keine Klimaanlage vorhanden. Es war somit ziemlich heiss im Zimmer, auch nachts. Die Fenster lassen sich nur spaltweise öffen. Das Bad ist sehr klein und Überschwemmungen in der Dusch die Regel. Insgesamt waren wir enttäuscht, insbesondere wenn man die durchschnittlichen Bewertungen dieses Hauses ansieht.",3,2013,09,08
233,Delusa,"Stiamo soggiornando in questa guesthouse per due notti. L'aspetto esteriore della struttura è magnifico, la tipica casa dublinese e anche gli interni sono belli. Purtroppo la nostra camera, una superior, non soddisfa le mie aspettative. Siamo al piano terra con la finestra che da' sul muro, la stanza spoglia con arredamento datato e un sistema di illuminazione inadeguato e strano. Devo alzarmi da letto e andare alla porta per spegnere le luci.  Il bagno sembra nuovo ma piccolo. Aspetto positivo la colazione abbondante e ben fatta, una vera delizia. Nob c'è abbasta parcheggio ma è possibile usare il parcheggio a fianco lasciando le chiavi alla reception. Il personale è cortese e molto disponibile. Peccato per la stanza che comunque non vale il prezzo che pago. ",4,2013,08,23
233,Kleine Oase im geschäftigen Dublin,"Dieses sehr gepflegte Haus liegt unweit des Zentrums, jedoch an ruhiger Lage (abgesehen wenn Im Stadion daneben eine Veranstaltung statt findet).
Die stilvolle, viktorianische Einrichtung und die äusserst aufmerksame und freu ndliche Bedienung hat ubs sehr gut gefallen. Wir haben uns sofort sehr wohl gefühlt. Das beste Frühstück von 8 guten Hotels, die wir in Irland besucht haben.",5,2013,08,03
233,ottima esperienza,"simpatica situazione in una tipica casina irlandese, grande cortesia, una suntuosa colazione anche se l'ultima notte partendo alle ore 5 non abbiamo usufruito della colazione al sacco pur prevista nelle politiche dell'hotel.
posizione un po fuori ma moto ben servita dai mezzi pubblici.
distanza importante dall'aeroporto, ci vogliono circa 30 minuti di taxi  con 30/35 euro di costo.",4,2013,07,29
233,Ottimo b&b in dublino,"Camera  molto bella e spaziosa, personale molto gentile, colazione sontuosa à la carte. Le camere sono pulite. Si può parcheggiare nel cortile della house, e se non c'è posto il personale ti sposta l'auto appena possibile. Non è vicinissimo al centro, circa 20 minuti di buon passo. Il bagno è un po' anonimo, anche se pulito. 139 euro la quadrupla con colazione su booking.com",5,2013,07,13
233,Schönes B&B mit tollem Frühstück,"Lage in gutem Viertel etwas abseits des Zentrums, dafür aber ruhig (wahrscheinlich aber weniger, wenn Rugby Spiel im Aviva-Stadion nebenan). DART-Station um die Ecke sehr praktisch, Bus in die City und zum Flughafen schon schwieriger. Frühstück sehr abwechslungsreich, liebevoll zubereitet und angerichtet",5,2013,06,30
233,Un buen desayuno no lo es todo,"Estuvimos tres días en este 'hotel' (es un B&B más que un hotel). En conjunto es bueno, pero en mi opinión creo que está sobredimensionado, quizás por sus excelentes críticas me esperaba más. Un edificio antiguo, con lo que eso conlleva, en el barrio de Ballsbridge reconvertido en hotel, con las comodidades básicas y servicios justos (una TV pequeña sin apenas canales y Wifi en las habitaciones, nada más). Estancias no muy grandes (al menos la mía), pero sí confortables, aunque sin grandes florituras. 

Eso sí, como se ha dicho ya, un desayuno delicioso (comida de muy buena calidad, variada y en cantidad, al estilo irish), y el personal muy amable y atento. En contra: lo alejado de la zona (está al lado de estadio Aviva, hay que coger un tren desde el centro de la ciudad, 3 paradas, 2€), y que la limpieza podría ser mejorable, aunque no estuviera mal. En definitiva, un buen desayuno no lo es todo, aunque cuenta. Lo considero un excelente B&B, que no hotel.",4,2013,06,03
233,en general bien,"nos gusto el hotel 
el desayuno y el comedor estupendo 
las habitaciones eran bonitas, para mi gusto, demasiado clasico 
la atencion correcta y la limpieza es buena
estuvo muy bien pero me parece sobrevalorado 
la ubicacion muy bien tambien",4,2013,05,20
233,La tipica casa Dublinese,"Ariel House è la tipica casa immersa nello splendido verde di Dublino a due passi dallo stadio e dalla fermata della metro\treno. Abbiamo scelto una stanza molto grande con un'ampia finestra al piano terra che dava sul giardino frontale. Lontana dal caotico centro di Dublino è un'ottimo punto di appoggio per visitare la città. Buono l'accoglienza e sopratutto la pazienza della receptionist nel ""capire"" tutte le nostre richieste.",4,2013,04,25
233,Lo stile di una location di charme,"Abbiamo prenotato ad un prezzo molto conveniente in questa bella townhouse  che si trova in un bel quartiere di Dublino ,anche se non centralissimo.La camera che ci hanno assegnato all'arrivo era un pò piccola e scomoda per tre persone ( 2 adulti e 1 bambino),ma  la disponibilità del personale ci ha dato la possibilità di spostarci in una camera molto più ampia e comoda . La colazione è senz'altro il fiore all'occhiello della struttura per qualità e quantità del cibo. Inoltre ,dato che eravamo un gruppo di sei persone , ci hanno servito la colazione in un tavolo apparecchiato  nella drawing room solo per noi : sembrava di essere nel salotto di una casa privata , bellissimo! Unica nota dolente ,se cosi' si può dire,è la distanza dal centro.",4,2013,02,21
233,ECCELLENTE! e una prima colazione da favola!!!,"Ho soggiornato per 6 notti all'Ariel House e lo consiglio vivamente a chi sia alla ricerca di un posto speciale, fuori dall'anonimato delle grandi catene alberghiere e delle loro valutazioni standardizzate. E' un posto pieno di fascino, con un'atmosfera fuori dal tempo. L'accoglienza alla reception è cordiale, il personale è gentilissimo. Unico neo; le camere non sono tutte allo stesso livello, la mia prima stanza non mi piaceva tanto e ho chiesto di cambiare; per lo stesso prezzo mi hanno assegnato una suite favolosa!  Ma alcuni miei colleghi avevano delle camere al pianterreno non troppo accoglienti e disadorne. 
Non è indicato a chi voglia dimagrire :-): ogni pomeriggio nella sala comune, con accoglienti divani, pianoforte  e caminetto, offrono agli ospiti gratuitamente torte e biscotti con il tè o caffè, e la prima colazione è superiore a quella di qualunque albergo a cinque stelle. Quando sono entrata mi sono servita al  buffet, già di per sé eccellente, e pensavo che fosse finita lì. E invece no, non era che l'inizio; mi vedo consegnare un menù e ordino al tavolo dei piatti da favola - vi invito a leggere il menù della prima colazione sul loro sito, non crederete ai vostri occhi, e la qualità è davvero incredibile! Pensate che indicano sul menù la provenienza dei loro prodotti; le marmellate, il burro salato, il pane squisitoi i formaggi ecc., una sorta di slow food, insomma. Non per caso segnalano sul sito AWARD WINNING BREAKFAST.
E soprattutto: il rapporto qualità prezzo è da non credere: avevo prenotato con molto anticipo con hotels.com e sono riuscita a pagare €45 a notte, colazione esclusa.",5,2013,01,27
233,Assolutamente OTTIMO!,"Ho soggiornato dopo capodanno con gli amici, davvero un'ottima struttura, un 4 stelle assolutamente economico, confortevole e con uno staff veramente cordiale e disponibile.
Faccio alcuni esempi: la stanza di una coppia di amiche aveva la serratura difettosa e hanno provveduto subito a cambiare loro stanza;
si sono proposti per recuperarci un taxi che ci portasse in aeroporto trattando un prezzo assai vantaggioso;
avevamo l'aereo prestissimo al mattino e ci hanno fatto trovare pronto un grazioso ""packed breakfast"";
nel salotto di ingresso c'è sempre disponibile acqua, tè caldo e alcuni dolcetti, gratuitamente a qualsiasi ora.
Elegante struttura in stile vittoriano, molto pulito e tenuto ottimamente nonostante si capisca si tratti di una struttura ""storica"".
L'unico difetto, se così si può dire e se proprio bisogna trovarne uno, è la distanza dal centro che ti obbliga a prendere il bus (fermata a circa 200 metri) o la dart.
Lo consiglio assolutamente!",5,2013,01,12
233,Dormire a Dublino,"Sono stato a Dublino recentemente ed ho soggiornato all'Ariel House. Pulita, ottima prima colazione ma soprattutto personale educato e simpatico. Mi hanno aiutato per alcuni problemi con generosità e prontezza. Sicuramente non posso che parlarne molto bene. Giorgio",5,2013,01,10
233,"estilo, tranquilidad y atención","En el Ariel house se respira atmósfera dublinesa, elegancia y tranquilidad.
 La recepción es impecable y el servicio atento. Desayunos variados y bien presentados, aunque en otras zonas de Irlanda son más abundantes y sabrosos. Habitaciones grandes y bonitas, con el pequeño fallo de poco espacio para poner tus cosas. La zona es agradable, bien comunicada y el servicio de taxi al aeropuerto tiene una excelente relación calidad/precio (por 28 euros te reservan un coche de lujo). Repetiría y aconsejaré la estancia. La única crítica que podría hacer es que me he encontrado pelos ajenos en la bañera y sugiero perfeccionar la limpieza en estos detalles. Por el resto, de verdad, una experiencia muy positiva.",4,2012,12,19
233,Alt aber Super,"Lage sehr schön, in der nähe des Fussballstations von Dublin und somit auch zu den Öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln. (DART"" = Strassenbahn)
Alles im alten Still gehalten, sehr freundliches Personal, Saubere Zimmer und Palmen im Garten.",5,2012,10,26
233,Schimmel auf Frühstückstoast,"Wir waren auf unserer 3-wöchigen Urlaubsreise für 2 Nächte mit Frühstück im Ariel House, was als guter Abschluss gelten sollte. Leider waren wir sehr enttäuscht zum einen von dem sehr kleinen und dunklen Zimmer, in dem wir unseren 2. Koffer nur mit Mühe öffnen konnten, von dem defekten Fön und Toilettensitz ganz zu schweigen. Dazu kam dann noch Schimmel auf unserem Frühstückstoast, wo der Lieferant Schuld haben sollte laut Servicekraft. Der krönende Höhepunkt war jedoch, dass man unseren kleinen Mietwagen auf dem sehr engen Parkplatz angefahren hat und trotz eindeutiger Beweislage die Servicekraft sich weigerte die Polizei zu rufen oder den Verursacher zur Rede zu stellen. Die Menschen in Irland sind sehr nett, was in diesem Hotel gänzlich gefehlt hat. Der Gesamteindruck wird nicht der sehr guten Bewertungen gerecht und die Lage ist definitiv für einen Städtetrip zu weit outside.",2,2012,10,19
233,Un estupendo alojamiento en Dublin,"Mi mujer y yo hemos estado cuatro días en este encantador Bed & Breakfast de Dublin. La estancia ha sido muy agradable. El desayuno es estupendo, con una parte buffet y otra de carta. Muy completo y muy bien atendido. Dispone además de un salón muy acogedor, donde tomar un café y relajarse. Las habitaciones son limpias y muy confortables.
Quizá el único inconveniente es que no está en el centro de Dublín, pero hay autobus y tren de cercanías cerca.",5,2012,10,13
233,A unos pasos de la estación de tren,"Estuvimos hospedadas solo dos noches en Ariel House. Encontramos muy conveniente que se encontrara a solo 100 metros de la estación de trenes que nos llevaba al centro de Dublín.
La recepción del hotel muy confortable, con sabrosas delicatessen para degustar a todo momento. Las habitaciones amplias con ventanales que daban al frente del hotel, con muy buena luminosidad. El baño super amplio y con bañera. 
En la recepción que operaba 24 horas, siempre había alguien amable dispuesto a ayudarte.
Lo que más nos gustó fue el desayuno, superb! servido en un jardín de invierno, con techo vidriado, lo que le daba al lugar un toque especial. Había un menú del cual se podía pedir todo, nos encantaron los pancakes con crema y frambuesas!! exquisitos!!",4,2012,10,12
233,Super Frühstück!,"Flughafenbus und Bus für die Innenstadt halten in der Nähe. Liegt etwas abseits. Fußläufig ist die Stadtmitte in ca. 30 Minuten zu erreichen. Sehr schönes Haus in einer gepflegten Gegend. Das Zimmer war ok und sauber. Das Frühstück war super. Sehr lecker. Man konnte aus einem kleinen Buffet auswählen und zusätzlich von der Karte bestellen. Wir haben für zwei Personen insgesamt 11 Euro pro Tag für das Frühstück bezahlt. Dies war das beste und günstigste Frühstück, welches wir auf unserer Irland-Rundreise hatten. Am Nachmittag gibt es selbst gebackenen Kuchen, Kekse, Kaffee und Wasser kostenlos. Der Kuchen war immer ein Highlight. Wir würden dieses Haus jederzeit wieder buchen!",4,2012,10,03
233,Formidable hotel en Dublin,"Hicimos este verano (2012) un viaje en familia a Dublín. Quedamos encantados con este hotel y sus servicio. Espectacular desayuno que puedes configurar a tu gusto. Habitación muy amplia y cómoda, aunque el armario es de época y por tanto un poco incómodo. El personal de servicio es muy atento y en recepción nos dieron magníficos consejos para viajar por los alrededores de Dublín y sobre los sitios a visitar. 
La estación de tren está a 200 metros y te permite ir al centro de Dublín o a poblaciones costeras. Desde luego volveríamos encantados.",5,2012,08,30
233,Lovely house,"Hotel molto accogliente in una zona davvero tranquilla della città con camere ampie , pulite ed ariose. 
Molto carina la sala per la colazione dove è possibile fare la classica colazione al buffet con succhi di frutta, yogurt, cereali e qualche dolce mentre, per quanto riguarda il salato, dal menù alla carta è possibile scegliere piatti preparati al momento come la classica irlandese con uova, bacon, salsicce, funghi e pomodoro.
Per chi sta pochi giorni a Dublino tuttavia la posizione non è delle migliori in quanto è abbastanza decentrato.",4,2012,08,20
233,Absolut zu empfehlen,"In diesem schönen viktorianischen Haus hatten wir ein stlilvolles, bequemes und großes Zimmer mit Blick auf die (ruhige) Lansdowne Road. Abseits des Innenstadttrubels war am Morgen oft Jogging angesagt, z.B. entlang des nahen River Dodder.
Danach gab's das ausgezeichnete und abwechslungsreiche Frühstück - wer mehrere Tage im Ariel House bleibt, dem empfehle ich, das Angebot mal durchzuprobieren.
Das Personal war immer sehr freundlich, hilfsbereit und zuvorkommend. Im Salon vor der Rezeption gibt es kostenlos Kaffee und Kuchen. 

Die nächste DART-Station (Lansdowne Road) ist keine 5 Min. entfernt, von dort sind es 3 Stationen bis zur zentrumsnahen Tara Street Station. 
Beim nächsten Besuch in Dublin wird das Ariel House auf jeden Fall wieder erste Wahl sein.",5,2012,08,04
233,Un B&B che somiglia ad un albergo,"Bello, un po' affollato ad agosto 2009 (la qual cosa impatta sulla gestione della colazione).",3,2012,07,18
233,Voller Erfolg,"Ich kann mich den pos. Bewertungen nur anschließen. 5 Nächte  Family Zimmer nur zum Schlafen völlig ausreichend. Im Bedezimmer etwas wenig Abstellplatz, wenn man etwas mäkeln möchte. Wir würden wiederkommen. ",4,2012,07,09
233,Hübsches Hotel mit super Service,"Ariel House ist ein authentisches viktorianisches B&B, der Aufenthalt ein Erlebnis ! Das Personal vom ersten Moment an sehr freundlich, zuvorkommend und hilfsbereit. Auf meine Nachfrage, ob das zugewiesene Zimmer wirklich ein Superior sei wurde dies zwar bejaht, aber trotzdem sofort ein Umzug für den nächsten Tag angeboten. Wir bekamen dann eine Junior Suite ohne Aufpreis !! Zwar zur Straße hin gelegen, aber durch die ruhige Lage des Hauses war das kein Problem.
Es stimmt das an den Decken Staubweben hängen und auch das Bettgestell war etwas staubig. Und der Kleiderschrank in der Suite war schon recht klapprig - eben jahrhunderte alt  ;o)  Aber diese kleinen Mängel wurden durch das Personal und den Service mehr als wett gemacht. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist für deutsche Gewohnheiten etwas dürftig, doch die Speisen von der Karte sehr lecker. Und der ""complimentary afternoon tea"" hat uns angenehm überrascht. Alles im Allem sehr zu empfehlen.",4,2012,07,06
233,Meine bislang beste Unterkunft in Dublin,"Am letzten Wochenende war ich zum vierten Mal in Dublin, diesmal als letzte Station einer Irland-Rundreise mit dem eigenen Auto. Nachdem wir uns spontan entschieden hatten, in Dublin Station zu machen, habe ich ein Zimmer für eine Nacht schnell noch im Ariel House per Internet gebucht, nachdem ich nach einer Unterkunft möglichst zentral, aber mit eigenem kostenlosen Parkplatz gesucht hatte. Die Entscheidung für das Ariel House war goldrichtig, ein wunderschön renoviertes Gebäude, zentral genug, um zu Fuss in ca. 20 min zum Trinity College zu gehen, aber auch gut angebunden mit ÖVP (DART). Das Personal supernett, das Zimmer geräumig und geschmackvoll eingerichtet, sauber, einfach nichts auszusetzen. Und das Frühstück einfach klasse, das beste Frühstück der ganzen zweiwöchigen Reise. Bei meinem nächsten Besuch in Dublin werde ich auf jeden Fall wieder das Ariel House wählen. Unbedingt empfehlenswert!!",5,2012,06,05
233,bellissimo,"Sono andato via con il ricordo del verde dalla finestra.Albergo bellissimo,pieno di fascino,in una strada tranquilla  e con un personale gentile e disponibile.Camera spaziosissima e al 1 piano come richiesto con piccoli grandi dettagli:asse con ferro da stiro in camera,tavolino con tutto l'occorrente per un te' in camera,specchio per il trucco in bagno.Tanto silenzio con poche macchine e un lontano rumore del treno che ti ricorda che la stazione del treno e' a poco piu' di 50 mt.Grande prima colazione,con scelta a buffet e 1 piatto caldo a scelta dal menu'e arredamenti di gran classe.Te' delle 5 con dolce offerto nella sala a fianco dell'ingresso.
Tv lcd in camera con 14 canali solo inglesi.
Per andare in centro svoltare dalla parte opposta dello stadio.Dopo un semaforo a 50 mt.andare dritto per altri 100 e all'altezza del palazzo con i vetri andate sempre dritti e vi troverete in centro con una piacevole passeggiata.Per 3 notti con prima colazione inclusa ho speso 306,00,tra le meglio spese degli ultimi anni.Consigliatissimo

233,Semana Santa por Dublin,"Nos gusto mucho el hotel. Buena ubicación (si bien es lejos del centro, queda a 20 minutos caminando y al lado de una estacion de trenes) y tranquilo. El personal muy amable y atento en todo momento. La habitación muy cómoda. El wi fii andaba perfecto sin problemas. Teníamos para prepararnos te y cafe en la habitación.
Puntos a mejorar: las almohadas eran muy malas, el agua caliente de la ducha no andaba bien (sobre todo a tener en cuenta que hace mucho frio en irlanda siempre) y el mando a distancia de la tv no tenía pilas.",4,2012,04,09
233,Lovely place,"Sono stato in questo albergo insieme con altri due amici, durante l'ultimo festival di St. Patrick e ho trovato questa sistemazione perfetta, perchè lontana dall' incredibile confusione del centro della città, ideale per riprendersi un attimo, tra l'altro in un quartiere molto tranquillo e abbastanza elegante. La distanza dal centro,quindi, non è proprio pochissima, ma in 20/25 minuti a piedi ci si trova davanti alla statua di Molly Malone, in ogni caso c'è una fermata del treno (DART) a pochi passi dalla Ariel House.  L'albergo è davvero molto carino, la struttura è quella di una classica Townhouse anglosassone. L'interno è davvero confortevole, c'è una living room con tanto di pianoforte, dolcetti, divani e camino..ambiente perfetto per rilassarsi un po'. Le stanze sono comode e abbastanza ampie. La colazione, inclusa, è davvero ottima. un buffet colazione classico (latte, biscotti, cereali, cornetti...nutella!!) e in più si può ordinare  un piatto della cucina...ottimi i pancakes!!! da consigliare sicuramente.",4,2012,03,19
233,Da scoprire,"Ho trascorso un week end a Dublino in dicembre, è una citta da scoprire, piena di vita, di gente e di bei locali. L'albergo è confortevole e ben collegato al centro raggiungibile sia a piedi (30 min di passeggiata) che con i mezzi, le stanze sono un pò piccole; la colazione sebbene a pagamento, è varia e sufficiente ed è molto carina la verenda dove viene servita. Nelle vicinanze dell'albergo ci sono ottimi ristoranti. 
Dublino è una città che merita una visita",4,2012,03,14
233,Guter Preis aber Zimmer zur Straße meiden!,"Habe eine Nacht Anfang Dezember im Ariel House im Zuge einer Geschäftsreise verbracht. Bei Buchung über booking.com habe ich für die Übernachtung ohne Frühstück 59€ gezahlt. Der Preis ist in Ordnung. Das Hotel liegt ein wenig außerhalb des Zentrums gleich an der Dart-Line, nur eine Minute von der Station entfernt. in zwei Minuten ist man außerdem beim Fußballstadion. In der direkten Umgebung sind nicht viele Geschäfte und Lokale, auf Anraten der Rezeptionistin habe ich aber in 10 Gehminuten ein nettes Pub erreicht. Das Personal war sehr freundlich. Im Haus gibt es gratis WLAN. Die Zimmer sind relativ altmodisch aber nicht abgewohnt, dafür sauber und gemütlich. Einziges Minus war, dass mein Zimmerfenster zu einer doch recht stark befahrern Straße hinaus ging und der Straßenlärm relativ laut war, wenn auch noch in einem erträglichen Ausmaß.",4,2011,12,28
233,"Bestes Hotel, in dem ich bislang uebernachtet habe","Es liegt in einer super Umgebung, mein Zimmer war fuer den Preis, den ich bezahlt habe, ueberraschend gross und sehr gut ausgestattet (ich hatte zwei Betten fuer mich allein!), man fuehlt sich einfach nur wohl, das Fruehstueck war lecker, das Personal sehr nett und hilfsbereit, es gibt einen Aufenthaltsraum, der aussieht wie ein Wohnzimmer (Sofa, Sessel, Kamin, Klavier...) und mein Badezimmer wurde jeden Tag blitzeblank geputzt und ich hatte jeden Tag neue Handtuecher. Ich habe mich einfach nur wirklich wohl und sehr gut aufgehoben gefuehlt und wuerde dort jeder Zeit wieder uebernachten",5,2011,12,18
233,Sentirse como en tu propia casa,"Hemos pasado 5 dias en Dublín, y afortunadamente hicimos caso a las recientes críticas sobre este establecimiento, a mitad camino entre un hotel clásico y un B&B de lujo.
Antes de entrar ya te da gusto ver el exterior del hotel,  una casa victoriana bastante grande. El recibimiento fué inmejorable, sin apenas ningún papeleo. Tienen a disposición de los clientes siempre que quieras café, té y pastas, que sobre todo por la tarde noche se agradece. Como íbamos toda la familia, 4 personas, reservé la habitación familiar, y resultó una agradable sorpresa, tanto por su gran amplitud, como por el mobiliario, detalles en los baños y su limpieza.
Muy buen desayuno, tienen una carta donde elegir, y entra dentro del precio del hotel cuando en la mayoría de hoteles en Dublín el mismo va aparte, amén de lo copioso y bueno del mismo.
Parking gratuito en el mismo establecimiento, con lo que es muy recomendable si alquilas un coche para visitar el país. En taxi al centro el precio puede oscilar de 7 a 10 euros dependiendo del tráfico, pero si váis 4 desde luego merece la pena el taxi, por el precio del transporte público. Hay una parada en la misma calle a unos 300 metros. Andando hasta grafton street se tarda unos 30 minutos.
En definitiva si vuelvo alguna vez a Dublín sin duda repetiré este hotel.",5,2011,12,09
233,Albergo carino e bella struttura,"L'albergo in questione è grazioso,la struttura è una casa in stile vittoriano antica ma molto curata.Le stanze pulite anche se quella in cui mi hanno sistemato era un po' piccola.Ottimo il rapporto qualita' prezzo,wi-fi gratuito,buona la posizione (1 min.dalla fermata treno,5 min dalla fermata bus e a piedi 20/25 minuti dal centro citta'),molto cordiale e disponibile il personale.Lo stadio di Lansdowne Road è proprio a due passi e se siete appassionati o di calcio o di rugby vale la pena fare una visita,è un gioiello architettonico.
L'unico appunto da fare è che essendo ottobre per loro è una temperatura accettabile e quindi le stanze avevano i caloriferi spenti,secondo me invece era freddo.Il tutto è stato ovviato con una stufetta elettrica che ha risolto il problema.
Comunque non ho avuto altri problemi e mi sento di consigliare questo hotel.",4,2011,10,11
233,Abbastanza centrale,"L'edificio carino in mattoncini e situato a 100 metri dalla metro e quindi ottimo per raggiungere il centro. Le stanze in stile  vittoriano molto carine e ampie; purtroppo la nostra camera era senza vista quindi è utile chiedere camere ai piani più alti. La colazione abbondantissima in stile europeo e Irish: cornetti, yogurt e cereali ma soprattutto salsiccia,  pudding bianco e nero, uova, pomodoro, bacon, etc etc tutto ottimo. Il personale gentile ed alcuni parlano anche un buon italiano. Da ritornarci",4,2011,09,09
233,4 días en Ariel house,"Ariel House no está en el centro de Dublín, está en el barrio de Ballsbridge, hay que coger transporte para ir al centro de la ciudad, pero vale la pena alojarse en Ariel House situado en unas calles preciosas con árboles y casas victorianas. Ballsbridge es un barrio residencial de lo mejor de Dublín, hay varias embajadas cerca.
Me llamó mucho la atención la amabilidad de absolutamente toda la gente que trabajaba allí, no es tan corriente encontrar a un personal de hotel tan bien dispuesto para cualquier cosa que se les pidiera o se les preguntara.
El edificio es una casa victoriana muy bonita, la decoración no es un estilo muy moderno, es más bien con aires del pasado pero que a mí personalmente me gusta. 
¿Qué decir sobre el famoso desayuno de Ariel House? pues lo que todos dicen que es, excelente. Recuerdo un día en el que desayunamos huevos escalfados con salmón... buenísimo.
No se puede pedir más en conjunto, ya que la combinación de  situación del hotel, habitación, desayuno, amabilidad del personal y el precio es más que positiva.
No dudaría en volver a Ariel House si vuelvo a Dublín. Y aunque no esté en el centro de la ciudad se agradece volver a la tranquilidad de las calles de Ballsbridge después de haber estado en el centro que a veces o al menos en agosto estaba con mucha gente.
No lejos de Ariel House hay un sitio llamado Kanum que tienen comida Thai  y es excelente, es take-away y también se puede comer allí aunque es pequeño.

233,"il posto che volevo, la citta' che sognavo","che dire? ariel house e' stata una delle note piu' positive del mio viaggio in irlanda
ho trascorso 4 notti li e sia io che la mia compagna ce ne siamo andati con il sorriso e il pensiero di tornare un giorno.
la nostra stanza era pulita e elegante, il servizio quasi perfetto.
inoltre lansdowne e' una strada molto piacevole e facilmente raggiungibile",4,2011,08,04
233,Fabuloso,"Nos quedamos 2 noches en Dublín y este hotel nos encantó.
Preciosa casa georgiana restaurada y decorada con muy buen gusto.
La habitación era amplia, con vistas al jardín, baño con ducha y bañera.
Los desayunos deliciosos.",5,2011,08,02
233,sympathisches B&B mit sehr freundlichem Service,"Reizendes Haus im viktorianischen Stil in sehr gepflegter und vor allen Dingen ruhiger Umgebung. Alles ist gut renoviert, der Service ist sehr freundlich und das Frühstück reichhaltig, mit viel Auswahl und wirklich lecker. Super Verkehrsanbindung per Bus und Nahverkehrszug. Habe selten so erholsame Tage in einem Stadthotel verbracht!",5,2011,05,31
233,Zum Wohlfühlen,"Das Ariel House ist ein ruhiges Hotel in schöner gepflegter Umgebung. Unser Zimmer und Bad waren sehr sauber. Die MitarbeiterInnen waren kompetent, freundlich und hilfsbereit, Das sehr gute Frühstück war ein guter Start in den Tag, Das Hotel liegt nahe einer Haltestelle des Dart, das Zentrum ist aber auch gut zu Fuß erreichbar (15 Minuten). Bei weiteren Aufenthalten in Dublin werden wir wieder gerne im Ariel House übernachten.",5,2011,05,18
233,"Ottimo hotel, a pochi passi dalla metro","L'hotel è pulito e lo staff è molto professionale e cordiale.
La metro è vicinissima all'hotel e arriva al centro in tre fermate.
Le stanze sono piccoline ma la colazione è soddisfacente.
Il parcheggio è disponibile gratuitamente ma entrano non più di una decina di auto e l'albergo ha molto più di una decina di stanze mentre fuori l'albergo, l'auto si può pargeggiare tranquillamente me è gratuito solo dopo le 18 e 30",4,2010,09,04
233,Charmant und freundlich,"Das Ariel House ist kein LuxusHotel. Es bietet aber zu guten Preisen ein sehr charmantes Haus, sehr saubere Zimmer und freundliches Personal. Es liegt direkt an der Bahn. In 10min ist das  Stadtzentrum erreichbar. Parkplätze sind ausreichend vorhanden. Das Frühstück ist typisch britisch mit Cereals, Toast und ein Extra in Form von Eierspeisen oder Porridge. Frisch zubereitet und mit einem Lächeln serviert... :-). Wirklich zu empfehlen!",4,2010,02,23
233,Tolles Ambiente,"Das Ambiente in diesem Gästehaus hat uns sehr gut gefallen. Wir hatten ein schönes Zimmer. Es war ideal auf unserer Tour durch Irland, da wir unseren Mietwagen gut abstellen konnten und bequem das Zentrum von Dublin erreicht haben.
",4,2009,05,24
233,Kann man wieder buchen,"Das Ariel House ist eine anständige Adresse, wenn man ein paar Tage in Dublin verbringen möchte ohne ein Vermögen auszugeben. Mein Mann und ich verbrachten zwei Nächte in einem sauberen, schönen Zimmer mit alten Möbeln, leider war unser Bad noch nicht renoviert (andere Bereiche des Hauses sind gerade dabei, neu tapeziert und gestrichen zu werden). Die Lage ist prima. Wenn man mag, läuft man 10-15 Minuten ins City Centre (Grafton Street, St. Stephen's Green, Trinity College etc.), ansonsten sind es nur wenige Schritte bis zur nächsten DART Station, die einen entweder in die Stadt oder, wie wir es auch taten, nach Süden ans Meer (Dalkey, Dun Laoghaire, Killiney, Bray etc.) bringt. Beeindruckt waren wir vom Frühstücksbuffet, das durch die Option, sich noch Scrambled Eggs etc. braten zu lassen, bereichert wurde. Wenn das Haus voll ist, sollte man sich aber morgens nicht allzuviel Zeit lassen, in den Frühstücksraum zu gehen. Wir haben gesehen, dass manche Gäste erst mal warten mussten, bis wieder ein Tisch frei war. 
Das Haus liegt in einer ruhigen Gegend und das Personal ist sehr zuvorkommend und freundlich und verrät einem gute Restaurants und Pubs, wo nicht nur Touristen, sondern viele ""Locals"" hingehen.
Alles in allem eine gute Übernachtungs-Möglichkeit in Dublin.",4,2007,04,23
