60,"Central location, historic beauty with great service.","This hotel was central Las Ramblas Barcelona. There is a lot of construction at the moment and so that created extra noise and chaos as you exited the hotel. 
It has a wonderful location. Is quiet inside the hotel. It has a simple yet elegant buffet breakfast and the historic touches create a serene place. 

The only negative for us was that the trains run underground so the hotel rumbles all night and if you’re not a good sleeper this could be an issue. 

Customer service was excellent.

The room was spacious and had nice sized bathroom and space for large luggage.",4,2024,10,17
60,"Great location, clean and friendly ","Very clean, great location, room small but functional, needed some repair to previously flooded floor but we were out all the time and got it for a great price. You can hear the metro beneath you even 3 floors up so not great for light sleeper.Foyer Very pretty, staff helpful",4,2024,10,04
60,Charming comfortable place.,"This is an old monastery converted to a hotel in 1848. The public areas were like an old  Agatha Christie movie that Maggie Smith could have been in.  The location was good  ~very central~ you could walk almost anywhere, but it was also in tourist central and quite crowded.
The people that worked there were lovely and my room was huge and comfortable.",5,2024,10,02
60,"Amazing Oriente, will definitely come back","Very nice hotel with style, the staff were so friendly and always ready to help.
The location is magnificent with easy access to every spot on walking distance, and the rate per night for a spacious room is very convenient.
In my opinion, the best value for money.",4,2024,09,28
60,barcelona,"Location is really really good, breakfast was okey but the room they gave us was terrible  No windows and smells like a ham  but then they changed the room after our complaints . Be sure have a room with windows ..........................................",4,2024,09,26
60,Recommended,"A very nice hotel in a good location.
The rooms are comfortable and the staff pleasant and helpful.
The breakfasts were especially good and had all that I wanted including real milk for the hot drinks.
My only problem was the wifi in my room was VERY slow and I couldn't connect my phone at all.",4,2024,09,26
60,A Gem in Las Ramblas,"A truly outstanding hotel full of character and charm,great location in the heart of Las Ramblas. Our room was spacious with all the facilities we needed.The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful.All in all a true gem,which we will hopefully visit again.",5,2024,09,19
60,Great location,"Beautiful hotel. Staff were lovely. Great location for all that Barcelona has to offer. Attractions,  shopping, marina, beaches and restaurants. Highly recommend. Mercat de la Boqueria was so close and the fresh food and eateries were amazing!",5,2024,09,18
60,Good location.,"Great hotel.  Small room on las ramblas. Can be a bit noisy at night but no problem with earplugs. Clean, most comfortable bed I’ve had on current trip.  I recommend this hotel. Little balcony (but didn’t use it as it looked over a lane at with rubbish). The foyer has self serve water to fill water bottles.",5,2024,09,16
60,Like Sleeping in a Recycling Center,The location is in theory great on La Rambla. When you walk in the hotel the lobby is also charming. It has an old unfinished look but works. The room was simple to say the least. It was four beds facing each other with a desk and a chair and night tables on the side of two of the beds. The bathroom was actually fairly spacious as an exception. The curtains were also not very effective and a ton of light came in every morning. Breakfast was fine. The real problem was the noise level. Obviously there are people because you are on La Rambla. That was honestly the least of our problems as it felt like a trash compactor was going a lot of the night and people seemed to be throwing cans and bottles in the recycling constantly.,2,2024,09,09
60,Beautiful barca,"We loved Everything about the hotel. Beautiful room with Everything you need. Kettle, safe, air con, comfy beds and it was nice and quiet. The hotel has a lovely reception area with lots of character. Only down point is it doesn't have a bar. It's situated in a great spot on las ramblas.",5,2024,08,20
60,Lovely hotel in a great location!,"This hotel oozes charm from the moment you arrive. It is the oldest hotel in Barcelona, in a fabulous location right on La Rambla. The staff are professional and courteous. The lobby is comfortable as well as beautiful.

Our room was large by European standards with top-quality linens and great pillows. Our balcony overlooking La Rambla was such a bonus! Definitely reserve one of those rooms. A beautiful, classy spot right in the middle of everything!",5,2024,08,10
60,Worth,"The location and loby are just perfect. Staff was also very kind. I higly recommend this hotel. Breakfast was good, but they were not renewing many finished items, for eg. we could not eat scrambled egg during 3 days although we were not late. The explanation was it was finished. This is an issue but I am sure they will fix it. Still I would prefer staying there for the next time.",5,2024,08,09
60,Good location,"Good personal, place perfect, style and very clean what else is needed. Breakfast with fresh juice and after good start for explore. I love this hotel place because near food market its perfect spot for me. Really recommend and enjoy in Barcelona",5,2024,08,03
60,HORRENDOUS EVERYTHING!,"Absolutely horrifying experience on a daily basis for the 1 week of my stay. 
Everyday some guest were yelling at the reception. 
The hotel asked me to pay 14 euros per dress for ironing services. 
There was no coffe/tea in the room. There was nothing in the room except for a bed and tv. 
The hotel’s system does not process payments thru virtual card arranged by my travel agent. The two receptionists, while refusing to look me in the eye, made me wait in the lobby, anxious and stressed, refusing to give me my room key in the middle of my stay, until I made the payment using my personal credit card. 
They made zero effort to sort it out with the travel agent, to whom I had to call on my phone, but kept repeating that they can’t accept the virtual card payment. 
After 2 hours, the front desk manager finally came out and gave me the room key. 
I have never experienced such service and treatment at any hotel I’ve been to. 
This hotel is also extremely overpriced for the lack of amenities and services. 
Will NEVER return here even if it’s the last hotel open.",1,2024,07,15
60,Stay for the location and history.,"I stayed in two different rooms on two separate occasions. The first room is at the rear of the building, quite small but nice and quiet given the hotel's incredibly handy location. The second room is at the front, larger and well-presented but it did suffer from noise issues from the street and regular vibration from the trains directly underneath the building. The foyer area is beautiful despite having seen better days. Buffet breakfast is very good, but we were promised a takeaway picnic option on our last day as we were leaving early, which never eventuated.",3,2024,07,15
60,Lovely hotel. Excellent location. Just a couple of points….,"Upmarket hotel in an excellent part of town meaning that everything is more or less in walking distance.

Bedrooms were spacious and clean with very powerful showers!

Helpful, friendly and chatty staff. Thank you

Just to point out – the bar is no longer part of the hotel so, half a litre of beer cost me 10.45 euros. The exact same beer in the exact same quantity costs €6 on Plaça Real  30 seconds away. The breakfast was okay.

We would definitely definitely use this hotel again next time we are in Barcelona.",4,2024,07,11
60,"Good hotel, great location. Good value for money",Great location. Comfortable hotel and good value for money. Rooms were clean & comfortable. Breakfast was simple but ample. I would recommend this hotel. Stay away from restaurants directly outside hotel. They were expensive. Go to square directly opposite. Lots of restaurant options and much cheaper.,5,2024,07,01
60,Broken toilet and AC in 2 rooms,"We only booked 2 nights prior to boarding our cruise and had 2 rooms (one for my husband and I and the other for our teen sons). The first day everything seemed fine until we were getting ready for bed and our toilet wouldn’t flush. It wasn’t getting water to refill the tank. We fiddled with it and it was fine. Then we went to bed and woke up at 3am with the AC blowing hot air! We opened the door to the hallway to get some cooler air. Our sons were in a room across the hall and their AC never cooled the room at all. Then we were out sightseeing the second day and when we got back to the room to get ready for bed it was 930pm and our toilet wouldn’t flush. We tried everything. It had NO water. We called the front desk and they said they have no after hours maintenance and there’s nothing they could do. We had to use a trash can, fill it with water from the shower and then pour it into the toilet to flush. We checked out at noon the next day for our cruise and they made no attempt to fix our toilet or offer us another room or compensation. It’s ridiculous to expect your guests to stay in a room with no working toilet. Location was perfect and walkable but I’m not sure I would stay here after the issues we had with both rooms.",2,2024,06,30
60,If you want to spend perfect time in Barcelona,"It is our 2nd staying in Oriente Atiram Hotel. This time we are with our son 13 years old.
Hotel is perfect. Very clean, comfortable.  Location is perfect. You can go everywhere by walking. Breakfast is nice. I strongly suggest staying here :)",5,2024,06,24
60,5 Days in Barcelona,This hotel is right on La Rambla.  The architecture in the foyer spoke to a grand period for this hotel.  The staff were welcoming and very helpful.  The breakfast was in a beautiful setting.  The room was clean and well cared for during our stay.  Air conditioning could have been a little better.,4,2024,06,23
60,Hotel located on La Ramblas -  with clean rooms,"When you arrive at Oriente Atiram Hotel, you walk into this huge reception, and it gives you the feeling of entering a luxury castle from the 19th century. It is quite impressing :) The staff in the reception was friendly and helpful, but their computer systems must be dated... I prepaid the first night when I made the booking (which I had to do on the internet even thoug I wrote them an e-mail, but I am used to that, so not that big a problem). Then I paid the rest of the nights upon arrival. Since I was travelling in business I wanted a reciept for the stay in total - it was impossible.
The rooms are clean, and has an ok size. I did a HUGE mistake when I booked a superior room. All superior rooms are located with a french balcony facing La Ramblas. However, their windows are so far from sound proof, so I did not sleep at all the first night. It was like trying to sleep on the street... And at 0600, the metro started and the building was shaking. If you prefer the view over the beauty sleep, then pick the superior room, but if you need a few hours rest over the night, go for the standard room. They are facing inwards :)
Breakfast is just ok.",3,2024,06,14
60,Busy crowded location,This hotel is beautiful unfortunately our room was right above the Barcelona police station. So we would hear sirens and constantly see flashing lights in the evening & throughout the night .It was really loud and I could hear a lot of the outside noise from my room. I stood in room 118. You can also feel the vibration of the subway. The breakfast in the morning is not worth it..I have Traveled throughout Europe and I’ve come across much better breakfast’s  at other hotels with a wide variety of food with better quality. The hotel staff is very prompt and nice. They were always able to assist when needed. Next time my family and I will stay where it’s not so touristy.,3,2024,06,08
60,Wonderful stay,"Fantastic location. An oasis. Gorgeous foyer, clean and well appointed rooms. Helpful & friendly staff. Sparkling water on tap was an added bonus. Highly recommend if you are keen to explore the Gothic Quarter. Palau Guell is just around the corner as well.",5,2024,06,07
60,Just fab,We had such a wonderful stay at the Oriente Atiram. It is right in the hub of the Rambla and our balcony was overlooking the street so we could enjoy the atmosphere after a full day of sight seeing. The building is just amazing and has been converted into the wonderful hotel it is now. Our room was spacious and well kept by the housekeeping team. Breakfast had a good selection for all our family as we all eat very differently. It was just fab and I would highly recommend it.,5,2024,06,05
60,Would definitely go there again!,"The room was very nice, the staff very friendly as well.
I just had a problem with the window lock that I asked to get fixed every morning and nothing happened, but I found it funny tbh. Wouldn’t stop me from going there again when I’m in Barcelona.
Its location is amazing, and you can go anywhere in Barcelona from there within minutes",5,2024,06,05
60,A great stay in Barcelona,"The location was excellent and the foyer and breakfast area were impressive. The room was comfortable and had almost everything we needed (a mirror in the bedroom and iron would have been appreciated). Cooling was good and beds were comfortable. The breakfast was varied and staff were helpful. Overall, a great stay in Barcelona!",5,2024,06,04
60,Do not stay here,"Worst staff of any hotel I have ever experienced. So incredibly rude and disrespectful. Not accommodating whatsoever. The worst hotel I have ever encountered! Do not stay here- So many better options on la rambla. Stay at abba la rambla instead, it is so much nicer and the staff is so kind and over the top accommodating.",1,2024,06,02
60,Great hotel and staff.,"We stayed for one night in May and found this hotel and staff to be superb, great location and very comfortable room.
Our room was on the top floor overlooking Las Ramblas and was clean and very well presented.
Thank you to the reception staff who were very friendly, helpful and gave great advice on where to eat in the evening.",5,2024,05,24
60,Avoid at all costs!!,"The worst hotel experience I've ever encountered. 

Arrived at the hotel, the person in reception said, what I discovered to be a tiny room, was ready for check-in, then only to discover my colleague received a much larger room. Both room bookings clearly stated ""Twin City View Room"", so why would I not receive an equally large room as my colleague to begin with? Also, the heating did not work, and given the terrible weather in Barcelona that week, the stay became less than comfortable.

I had to wait more than 24 hours to change the room to a newer larger room, but like the smaller room, it was ice cold (heating function on the AC device did not work). I told the reception, they said there was nothing they couldn’t do.

Furthermore the key card stopped working over 10 times from Sunday until Thursday so I had to keep going down to reception to change to key (I separate the key card from mobile phone and other cards at all times)

The metro underneath the room (first floor) made room “shaking” every 15 minutes around the clock (24/7), leaving it impossible to get any sleep.

There was a lot of noise coming from the rooms in general (ventilation etc) that made it impossible to sleep for the entire stay.

The breakfast host was unpleasant every time we arrived for breakfast, to us and other quests, every single day",1,2024,05,24
60,A very poor stay at Hotel Oriente,"The hotel of the past no longer exists. May 2024, family stay, 2 adults and 2 children, room 110 on the first floor directly on the Rambla. Both windows didn't close properly so not even a minimum of insulation from external noise 24 hours a day including the subway which obviously we can't do anything about. Bathroom with tub/shower with the classic plastic curtain worthy of not even the worst 1 star hotel. Absence of toilet brush. Very poor breakfast and totally dedicated to Anglo-Saxon food. Zero offer of a minimum of basic Catalan breakfast products. In summary, a totally unjustified bill of 1300 euros for 4 nights. We will certainly not return, there are valid alternatives for these conditions.",1,2024,05,16
60,Great location,Room was small but clean. Staff friendly and efficient.  Reakfast is well worth it.  Would have liked achoice of pillows.,4,2024,05,06
60,Convenient Location,"Convenient location, reasonable cost, good customer service from the reception staffs and nice welcoming the reception/waiting areas are all positive experiences. Baggage dropping facility offered gives freedom of spending extra free time. Rooms are vary basic but comfortable. A coffee/tea making facility will improve the room experience. If not earlier check-in possible then on time check-in should be must, unlike ours was not read for another 45min at least. Overall we will be happy to stay here again.",4,2024,05,04
60,Tiny room and  overpaid!,"For 300 Euros we get a very small room, beetween bed and wall only 80 Centimetres, heating did not work, there was no wardrobe for clothes - only a small rack. The Bathroom had a plastic curtain and we heard the neighbors during the night!
We asked the reception for a bigger room, they told us all were so small!
The breakfast was as small as everywhere and in the tine garage we cratched the car!",2,2024,04,30
60,Great location & helpful staff,"Excellent location: in the center of Barcelona's main tourist area, but no noise.  Great choices for breakfast, and the desk staff was very friendly and helpful.",5,2024,04,25
60,Great Location,"Great location. Underground straight outside the door and the Airport Bus is available in about 15 min walk. 
Room was adequate. Spotless clean room and bathroom with a large shower. Only downside was no tea making facilities. Able to leave luggage at reception.",4,2024,04,19
60,NOT A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE,"1.Even after 2 email requests for adjacent rooms,and promise from the hotel,they were not ready at the scheduled check in time,we were asked to wait for more than 2 hours. Since we had pre booked tours, left our luggage at reception and went for the tour.
2.No charging points in the room for phone or any other devices. The available points are connected to the room phone and TV.
3.Not happy with the attitude of receptionists, did not even acknowledge our presence, went on chatting over the phone when we came back for check in at night.
4.Pillows are hard ,not comfortable for a good nights sleep.
5.No kettle or coffee making facility in the room.I was told that it will be provided only upon request.",1,2024,04,18
60,Don’t waste your money in this hotel,"I felt sorry for myself because it was a terrible experience for the price I paid (700€ for 3 nights), as the room was very dark and very basic, floor old and broken, bathroom was not clean there was hair around the bath, the bed sheets also full of dust the first night and my little was coughing the whole night.
in their website they have the label for disability access and I assumed it was the case but they had only 2 rooms accessible and they couldn’t change my room because they were already booked. So I had to leave the pushchair in the corridor, walk to the room, open the door and block it with a chair then come back to carry my son who was sleeping and put him in bed then come back to pick up the stroller, which was not nice and exhausting since I was alone. The receptionist with beard was not nice and just told me next time you should tell us in advance for the stroller! but they should also specify having only 2 rooms accessible, all the rest has 4 steps in the floor corridor. For sure I will not go back again, no need to mention how noisy it is, you can hear all what happens in the bathroom and the room next you in the middle of the night.",1,2024,04,17
60,Not great but nice,The hotel was nice. The staff was friendly. The room was good. However information regarding the air conditioning was misleading since there was supposed to be one but in reality it is only availably dyring summer. Breakfast was not great but good.,4,2024,04,15
60,"Nice hotel, great location lacking in service","The hotel and rooms were very clean and nicely decorated. The location of the hotel is perfect, very accessible and walkable to many sites and attractions. Also, very convenient to restaurants as well.
The downside of our experience was our rooms were extremely hot and there was no way to cool them down. We asked for assistance and were told to open the window, which allowed bugs to come in making sleeping difficult. Also, one of our rooms opened to a balcony this was an unsafe environment as sleeping with the balcony window open could allow intruders to enter. When I said this to the front desk, they told me just keep it open. Wow we were awake and use a fan.",3,2024,04,08
60,Perfectly located hotel,"Perfect location: you can reach the Market, the Gothic quarter and the port within 5 minutes on foot.
It doesn't look like from the front, but it's a big hotel with about 50 rooms on each of the 3 floors. When you enter  you get into a spacious historical lobby with bits of different styles and above it there is a beautiful gallery with a glass pyramid top, that serves as a breakfast area. The variety of breakfast was satisfying.
The room was big enough with ample storage capacity in the wardrobe. If your room is not on the front, it has miserable view, but at least it's quiet, you don't hear the buzz of the high street.
We were satisfied with the job of the maids.
As we arrived early we could leave our suitcase at reception and upon leaving early morning, we got packed breakfast.
The hotel offered a pick up service from airport which was convenient.",5,2024,04,06
60,Ideal situation,"Ideal situation - halfway along La Rambla. Virtually opposite Plaça Reial,  and then the Gothic Quarter. 10 minute stroll to Plaça Catalunya or to Port Vell marina. Very comfortable clean rooms. Good choice at breakfast buffet. Friendly helpful staff.",5,2024,04,01
60,Great location,Great location and cannot be beaten for being centre for everything. Super comfy bed & pillows and balcony overlooking La Rambla. Efficient staff at reception and rooms spotless. Fridge in the room and kettle with selection of tea & coffee. Large TV with BBC news. Great hairdryer and toiletries provided.,5,2024,03,08
60,Beautiful,"Could not ask for a better location!  
We could open the balcony window and one of us could sit and enjoy the sights of La Rambla.  
The room was big enough for two people. 
We had small communication problem with some of the staff but that wasn’t their fault I don’t know Spanish.  
It was also a problem if you wanted ice",5,2024,03,08
60,Best choice!,"All was perfect: on Rambla, near metro station, near Aquarium, near Barceloneta, near Gotic Square, many restaurants near, etc
The room was also perfect, good bed, big, every day cleaning. U can have free water, with or without bubble.
And for kids they have free candy:)
The stuff was also very nice. 
Best small money can buy!",5,2024,03,07
60,Rooms like in a cheap hostel,"This is definitely not a 4 star hotel. The rooms are very dated. Very disappointing. Location is ok and the lobby looks nice, but that's all.  Reception staff tries to be nice, but lacks hospitability when working under pressure. Will not come back.",2,2024,03,02
60,Amazing Location,"Central location , the lobby is really beautiful, front office staff very helpful , the room is good enough, breakfast was good. There's no kettle  or coffee tea  in the room, i called to get kettle and it been send immediately but sadly its very dirty and dusty inside it.",5,2024,02,20
60,Excellent central hotel,"The hotel was in a great location, it couldn’t have been more central. We were right in the buzzy vibe of the city as soon as we stepped out. Friendly and helpful staff who were happy to help. 
Secure and safe. 
Clean room with very comfortable bed. Very good value for money. 
Will definitely book to stay again whenever we visit Barcelona.",5,2024,02,20
60,"Room small but clean, very comfortable bed and great shower!","Beautiful lobby. Personnel very friendly. Room was quite small with no view, but a huge and very comfortable bed! No fridge or coffee/tea making facilities. Bathroom also small and not luxurious but very good shower. And the room was clean.",4,2024,02,19
60,perfect,"everything was PERFECT!! the hotel is easy to find, the staff are so kind and helpful, the rooms are amazing (clean, comfy, spacious) and the breakfast was delicious. i will definitely be recommending this hotel for anyone staying in barcelona!",5,2024,02,14
60,Fabulous hotel in a perfect central location,"Stayed here for a few days in December with friends.
Great location, very central and easy to find. 
Rooms were on the small side but were absolutely fine as we were out and about all day everyday.
It's on the Arc De Ramblas so there was a little bit of noise but nothing which spoiled our experience. The hotel is really beautiful, very nicely appointed.
We stayed on a B&B basis. The breakfast was plentiful and OK for what we wanted. 
This was a great location to be based at in Barcelona. Simply cannot fault it for the price we paid. 
Would highly recommend if you are there for a sort break.",5,2024,02,01
60,Just great all round !,"Great hotel, great location, and great staff who will do everything to make sure your stay is perfect!  You are right in the centre of las ramblas , right across from Place Real , everything is so convenient, I think it’s the best hotel for location in Barcelona !",4,2024,01,28
60,Recommended,"A very enjoyable stay here.
Friendly staff and a good double room which had a kettle and tea/coffee making facilities.
One big thing for me is access to a USB +/- HDMI port on the TV which was ok here.
Noise was minimal.
I am very pleased that my used towel and bed sheet did NOT get changed when my room was made up. I don't change my towels and sheets every day at home so why should a hotel do that.
Breakfast was very nice with cereal, hot food (scramble egg/bacon/sausages), bread, toast, buns, cakes, fruit... and real milk for the tea/coffee.
It is a 10-15 minute walk from Placa de Catalunya but only a couple of minutes to Liceu Metro.
I would happily stay here again.",4,2024,01,28
60,Good value for money,"Great location! The building is extraordinary , historical building former monastery offers and exquisite experience! The staff is exceptional! Very polite and well trained they always offer support when asked! Breakfast is just right!",5,2024,01,11
60,Good experience in Barcelona,"We visited Barcelona in Christmas 2023. The hotel is at the best location and very close to metro station. Although the hotel is quite old, everything was very clean, the staff was smiling and helpful.
We definitely believe that it is value for money.",4,2024,01,03
60,December 2023,"Really nice hotel in the center of Barcelona. Very clean and friendly personal in the reception Everything was ok except the breakfast…the quality was not the expected ..next time will book without breakfast. 
",4,2023,12,26
60,hard to beat,"We stayed here before and found it so right for what we wanted that we returned.  In the period between stays there have been some changes and it is even better.  The main difference is the design of the reception area which is now easier, bigger and much more stylish.  It is a basic room set up but has all you need and is in a location that is hard to beat.  I really liked the water stations that you can fill bottles from as well as the friendly and helpful staff.  We plan on making this our go to for Barcelona.",4,2023,12,14
60,"Very enjoyable stay,","Very enjoyable stay, although only there for four nights
 my only criticism 
is that there was no facilities to boil a kettle in the room this may well be because we're English and require copious amounts of tea",5,2023,12,11
60,"Great location, clean and friendly ","Very clean, great location, room small but functional, needed some repair to previously flooded for but we were put all the time and got it for a great price. You can hear the metro beneath you even 3 floors up so not great for light sleeper.Fpyer Very pretty, staff helpful",4,2023,12,10
60,a oasis on the ramblas ,"the atmosphere of the hall and the location of this hotel are number one. 
the reception was staff very professional and kind.
breakfast was very appreciated, with special baked apples, thanks to Simon, the waiter who is a passionate amateur pastry chef
If you like to attend the opera, like me, it is very  close to Gran Teatre Liceu 

",4,2023,12,07
60,Good experience,"Good price. Good size rooms and large bathroom. Very central to everything specially if you want to visit or walk La Rambla. Close to the cruise port as well. Friendly staff. We stayed there 2 nights, one before and another after our cruise.",4,2023,12,02
60,I really can’t fault this place!,"In an excellent location, right in the middle of Las Ramblas, though, apart from the carriage lights outside, you would walk past it, without even knowing it was there, the entrance opens up into an enormous and almost palatial reception area, reminiscence of its past history, with areas of exposed wall where the original decor is still visible. Easy access ramps for the disabled, (me) and an excellent welcome from the friendly staff who really couldn’t do enough for me. They charged my mobility scooter overnight and suggested places I shouldn’t go because access would be difficult.  My room was cleaned to a pristine level every day, and whilst I was warned against booking a Las Ramblas room, one because of the three step access, which I only just managed, and two because of the noise. I really enjoyed having the French doors open whilst having a drink and watching everything that was going on below me . I appreciate that wouldn’t be for everyone. I think three stars is more a reflection of the lack of amenities, i.e. no gym, no swimming pool, no sun Terrace et cetera rather than the quality of building and staff. I would certainly go back. Special thanks to all of the reception staff who really made my solo trip one to remember .",5,2023,11,26
60,A nice weekend in Barcelona,We stayed for 2 nights. The staff was very helpful and super polite! The reception area is really fascinating as they have kept the traditional architecture and it is entering into a hotel of the 20s in the previous century! The Ramblas is noisy as always so I would expect a little bit better soundproofing in the rooms.,5,2023,11,24
60,Basic good value for what we paid,"Lovely hotel right on La rambla so great location 
Rooms very basic but there is work going on so maybe will be improved 
Beds were comfortable and room was very clean it was very noisy mind you (could hear the telly from the room next door )
No fridge in room which was a real shame (think this would be a real problem in the summer months) and no tea or coffee making facilities",3,2023,11,23
60,OK for a 3 star,"The hotel lives up to its local rating of 3 star. Rooms very clean, crisp white bedding very good shower. 

Couple of down sides, no local info book in room (would be helpful) and lots of stairs to negotiate on crutches (I am disabled)).

On further thing, avoid room 414 unless you want a view of a brick wall (see photo) and duct from kitchen (food smell wafting through open window)",4,2023,11,22
60,Heart of Las Ramblas,"Centrally located, solid 3 star hotel with many practical amenities. Appreciated the refillable water glass bottle and the water dispenser located on each floor. The rooms were spacious and recently renovated bathrooms were functional and very clean, free of visible mould. The beds were firm and the pillows were unusually large. Memory foam pillows which took a while to adjust to. The sheets and towels were professionally laundered and clean. Daily house cleaning offered. 
Front desk staff were professional and friendly. The charming historical lobby was a highlight of the stay, and offered comfortable seating to lounge while we waited for our rooms upon check in. Did not try their buffet breakfast. There were a few oddities that knocked off perfect points; use of a physical key to enter the room and  inconvenient use of hotel safe where you have to leave a deposit to obtain another physical key. The noise from the street was not bad as long as the windows are fully closed.  Could feel some vibration from the subway line even being on the third floor. All in all, the stay at the Hotel Oriente capped off our European travel and met all of our expectations.",5,2023,11,21
60,"Kind, clean, big rooms, at Las Ramblas.","Very kind people - muy amables and centrally placed: at Las Ramblas, by two metro stations, walking distance within everything in the Center. The breakfast people were amazing ( Lilian, I think was her name ) as well as receptionists. The restoration is bringing the place to its past glory.",5,2023,11,12
60,"Central location, in/ near old town ","Bizarre numbering of rooms meant a trip back down to reception for clarification.  A lot of upgrading of rooms is on going.  Have never before stayed in a hotel room with no information (apart from fire escape map on door) - how / who to call on phone in emergency etc, breakfast time, use of safe, tv etc.   Fridge but no tea or coffee. (Water, yes).   Completely soulless- shame, because entrance hall is rather lovely.  Never had the breakfast - looked rather mundane, better coffee and croissant directly across the road.  
But, staff,  - Victor, - was kind  when, despite huge care and caution, had my wallet stollen (in la Rambla).    Very central, but Barcelona is hazardous due to amount of crime
I would not stay there again. As a lone traveller, this was not a good spot to be in, I thought I’d done my research 😢",3,2023,11,07
60,Ideal central stay,"The hotel was ideally located on La Rambla, but still quiet at night. The gluten free options for breakfast was a nice welcome treat! The bedrooms were basic but clean and comfortable. The staff on reception and in the breakfast room were all friendly and helpful.

We would stay here again. Thank you for the stay.",5,2023,11,05
60,Overall in regards to the hotel & our experience there was satisfactory. ,"The hotel is in a convenient location. The room was spacious & comfortable. The staff  is very friendly & helpful. The breakfast buffet was nothing special. We preferred eating somewhere else. Las Ramblas is not what it used to be. Very sketchy area especially at night. I would not recommend walking around las ramblas at night. Drugs, prostitutes & chance of thieves targeting you. We saw a couple of street fights in the evening which was very unpleasant. It’s also a very overpriced area as it caters to tourists. 
Daytime tourism is fine just be aware of your belongings as it is famous for pickpockets. ",4,2023,11,03
60,"Great locataion, not too great rooms and breakfast","Lobby is really nice, but halls to the rooms feel like needing a fresh construction. Standard rooms were reasonable, but far from cosy and nice- I would say, not a good price/performance. 

Locations is great. Most likely this is where the price comes from.  Another nice plus is drinking water ipionts in hallways.

Staff was friendly and polite, but all of them looked overworked. I hope hotel management takes good care of them 🫶

Breakfast was ""6/7"". Many things to choose from, but comparing to other hotels we have stayed - not too tasty.",3,2023,11,03
60,Excellent and comfortable. ,"The Hotel Oriente is architecturally beautiful. The service and staff are excellent. Breakfast is extensive. The room has everything you need, comfortable beds, good shower and very clean. I'm loving my stay here.",5,2023,10,29
60,Location location ,"Iconic hotel in the heart of La Rambla. Location couldn't get any better.
Friendly reception staff. We were upgraded to a family room on the Rambla side which was very nicely decorated which was great, although the windows didn't completely stop the noise outside which obviously was constant.  I had to wear earplugs as I'm a light sleeper. They don't supply irons and the paid service is a bit of a rip off to be honest, so I had to live with creases.  Storage was insufficient even for one person with very little hanging room and shelf space.  The beds are extremely comfortable, absolutely perfect! A kettle is supplied but the water jug provided was never refilled. Breakfast was average and the staff were quick to prepare tables for guests as it was generally busy. Asked for a late check out but told it wasn't possible due to availability. It's s very decent 3* hotel.

I would definitely return.

60,Las Ramblas,"Room and hotel were very clean.  Staff very friendly and helpful.
Hotel is in a PERFECT location!!!!!!  Our room was at the back of the hotel so did not hear any street noise!  My only disappointment was that coffee was not part of the accommodation",4,2023,10,23
60,Good Value,"Good value hotel right in the middle of things in the Las Rambles area. Elevators are very slow, so don’t get in a hurry then coming or going.  No ice available on the floors. Small rooms with minimal amenities.  Opened new reception area since we last stayed at this property.",4,2023,10,23
60,Great location,"Lovely hotel right in the middle of La Rambla which meant it was really lively both day and night. The reception area is beautiful. The room was nice and clean, great buffet breakfast and lovely, helpful staff. Would definitely stay there again.",4,2023,10,23
60,Location and helpful staff,"I gave it a 5. Location is superb, clean, friendly. Breakfast was fine and all that was needed. All we were looking for and good value. Lovely view over Las Ramblas too. Aerobus from airport most efficient to use. City bus tour to hop an and off was good too. ",5,2023,10,19
60,We will come back!,"Excellent location, really great, nice hotel, nice lobby, nice and clean room and bathroom, friendly staff, very good breakfast. The only thing missing in room, the possibility to boil a tea or coffee. Next time we will bring one from home! 😄
Thanks Atiram Oriente!",5,2023,10,10
60,"Bad service, overpriced, will never go again","No housekeeping for 3 days, needed to take the trash and get towels myself. Asked reception multiple times, nothing happened.
Small rooms, you can even open a small suitcase anywhere that is not you bed. 
No desk, no safe, no fridge, no ac temperature control.",2,2023,10,09
60,Overall good,"The room was nice, powerfull shower, always clean but the shower could be cleaner. The bed was to hard and narrow. The room has a little balcony, an aircon. You can fill up the waterbottle for free. A little fridge and a tv are available. The view over las Ramblas was always interesting. The staff was always helpfull and friendly. ",5,2023,10,09
60,Average experience,"Upon entering the hotel, we were not greeted with any warmness, as one would expect from a hotel of this reputation. He simply looked & sounded like he didn't want to be there, which just gave us an off first impression.
Upon entering our hotel, we then found out that lockboxes in the room are required to provide a $10 deposit for a key, which ended up being not a 'bad' thing, just not what you expect given the standard keypad 'set your own lock' boxes that are standard in hotels.
When my partner and I wanted to take a shower, the hot water required the faucet & shower to be turned on and we had to wait 10+ minutes for the water to *start* to begin getting warm. After 10+ mins, then it got hot.

Our floor (2nd) was 85% under construction, meaning we could hear all the construction of the workers during our time in the hotel.

I know these seem nit picky but these add up to the overall experience, as we are out of towners and the hotel plays a critical role in our experience of Barcelona",3,2023,09,28
60,Lovely stay!,"Just coming to the end of 6 nights here. Upgraded to a Ramblas room, yes it can be a little noisy, but it is atmospheric! We are on the 4th floor. As others have said, no kettle provided automatically but we asked for one , plus cups, and housekeeping brought one up within 15 minutes. There is a safe in the room, the key for which you pay 10€ but get that back when you return the key. Plenty of toiletries in the bathroom. The breakfast is basic but fine unless you’re desperate for full English! Water provided in a refillable bottle on arrival and there is a water dispenser on each floor. The location couldn’t be better and all the staff are very friendly. We will definitely stay here again if we come back to Barcelona.",5,2023,09,27
60,"Excellent location - close to all the shops, Gothic Quarter.  The metro a few steps. ",Very welcoming reception staff who managed to offer us an early check in. Room large and very clean. The foyer olde worlde - played cards here in the evening. Step outside the hotel right into the heart of Las Ramblas and the Gothic Quarter. I would stay at this hotel next time. ,5,2023,09,26
60,Disappointing customer service,"Canadians beware, the exchange rate offered when paying by credit card in Canadian funds was 15 cents per Euro higher than any other time I charged on my credit card in my 2 weeks in Europe.  It was my mistake for choosing to pay in a Canadian Funds instead of Euros, however, hotel was not sympathetic . Throughout my visit to rest of Europe with multiple credit card purchases , I did not encounter this issue. All transactions were $1.50 Can per Euro, Hotel Orient was $1.65 exchange rate. Hotel blamed on the bank . Why are they offering this option if it does not benefit or at least be fair to customers, very disappointing.",3,2023,09,20
60,City break ,Stayed here for the first time. Room big and spacious but could do with updating. Beds where comfortable.Very noisy at night with street noise and visitors in the hotel not respecting that others may be asleep. No tea and coffee facilities available in the room but was given a kettle so that we could make a drink. No fridge either so water was warm .Didn’t book breakfast but was told if we wanted it we could pay at reception which we did.plenty to choose from but not very warm. Dining room is clean and bright. Staff was lovely throughout our stay. Found the gothic quarter which is lovely. ,5,2023,09,16
60,An oasis of calm in a busy city,"Walked into this hotel from a hot busy street into an oasis of calm.
Staff were very helpful and pleasant.
Our room was a old fashioned and could have done with better mattresses and a shower screen that closes, otherwise we had a pleasant stay and would definitely return.",4,2023,09,08
60,Fab hotel ❤️,"Excellent location, hotel, staff thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Would recommend to couples, friends perhaps noisy area for families with younger children. Rooms clean towels and beds changed regular. Bathroom cleaned daily our room met our needs no issues 👌",5,2023,09,01
60,Not the best,"I’m a a bit disappointed of the room we stay in, nothing like the photos while we booked. On our confirmation slip also written a fridge is in the room, but isn’t.  When we check in at the lobby, staff is not every friendly either. 
 I won’t be visit this hotel again.",3,2023,08,21
60,Cockroach in the room,We booked this hotel since it where in the The Ramblas main street. All good until we first saw one cochroach on the door to the connecting room and later we had one in the bathroom. When talking with the staff they seem not to take this seriously at all. Not good,1,2023,08,14
60,Highly recommended,"Excellent central location, clean, very good service from the staff, good breakfast, we liked less that they didn't give us an iron, but the maintenance team irons for the guests and charges money for each item, beyond that it is highly recommended!",4,2023,07,01
60,Hotel Atiram Oriente - excellent,"Beautiful hotel in the heart of La Ramblas. Room were spacious, well equipped with small balcony. Staff were friendly and assisted us with bookings and places to go. Perhaps skip the breakfast. 
Highly recommend.",5,2023,06,27
60,"Prepare your holidays with Oriente Atiram Hotel.  Don't hesitate, beautiful experience. t du","Excellent stay, very confortable, unbeatable location and the attention of the wonderful staff.
The free water dispenser is especially appreciated and they lent us a kettle to prepare the water for the mate, at not additional cost. We will choose this hotel again on the next holidays.

60,Great location and lots of character,"Great location for this character filled hotel. It’s a little run down but the rooms are spotless and the furnishings pleasant. A couple of gripes: a kettle but only paper cups in the room, and no teabags, or milk (not even long life) . I asked for a small carton of milk and was told it would be sent but it never arrived. You pay for the great location with a fair bit of street noise but the windows are double glazed, which helps.",3,2023,06,15
60,Right in the middle of the Ramblas...,"Would rate this as a high three star hotel,  great position right on the Ramblas,  Lovely entrance/reception area and rooms quite acceptable,  breakfast was very dissapointing from English point of view, no fresh tea or coffee available it was all from machines but not very nice,  no butter for toast,  most bizarre was kettles in the rooms but no tea or coffee sachets at all to have a drink, asked at reception but told no they didnt provide drinks for the room,   this is the only hotel i have ever known not to be able to have tea or coffee in the room, if like most people want a cuppa soon as get up in the morning would suggest taking some of your own tea/coffee,    still wondering why the kettle ....??",3,2023,06,13
60,"Comfortable, cozy, and great location","Dear readers, this is a very charming hotel, it’s a step into a time capsule. When you enter the atrium, it is so lovely, it feels very 1920s …the best part of the hotel is the location…so many things are within walking distance, plus being in the old town is so fun…we loved exploring the old alleys, and going to the market, and so many delicious places to eat. The staff was so friendly and helpful…the room is dated, but very clean and the beds were so comfortable. It was hard finding family size rooms, this one was a winner, not ready to split rooms.",4,2023,06,10
60,Great location at a pretty property,"Convenient location on Las Ramblas. Booked this hotel for my sister, granddaughter  and I. Hard to find a hotel in Barcelona that could accommodate three people with all beds and not just having the addition of a hide-a-bed,  Beautiful lobby, although the bar was never open during our visit. I would not recommend the breakfast as it looked pretty basic for the price. Hotel was veery safe and comfortable. Day crew was very helpful, night crew not so much. ",4,2023,06,05
60,Centrally located value for money,In the heart of La Rambla... everything is walking distance. Safe and hassle free experience. Rooms were clean and functional. Would stay again. The buzz in the street outside is the essence of barcelona and added to our experience.,4,2023,06,01
60,Location - location - location ,This hotel is in the center of almost everything. Easy check with very friendly and helpful staff. This hotel is on the very busy La Rambla which gets very noisy at night but good windows kept the noise out. Shower was slippery and needed grab bars. Bed was too small for two people. Excellent buffet breakfast. Overall highly recommended because of location and staff. ,4,2023,05,28
60,"Good location, friendly staff.","We had a positive experience during our recent visit to this hotel as part of a Jet2 package deal. Arrived early in day so room nit ready but staff very friendly and happy to care for our luggage so we could explore until room ready. Room was satisfactory, at the back of the hotel so quieter, was clean and did the job well. The location is excellent, central location where there's lots happening and within walking distance to many tourist attractions, the marina, right on la ramblas and very near a metro station and hop on buses. The reception is beautiful. The breakfast was nice, continental and perfect to set you up for a day exploring. Based on our experience,  we would stay heed again. We would opt for a room not facing la ramblas so it is quieter. ",4,2023,05,24
60,NEVER AGAIN !,"We were offered a first small room (window not working). After complaining the lady at the reception was reluctant to change our room but offered  one of the worst room ( 1st floor with trucks, laundry reception under the room, youth hotel  in front  with noise i) with no window isolation at all. We had a blank night. Impossible to sleep ! We asked to move again. The guy at the reception was more supportive and finally offered a quiet room for the last day.",1,2023,05,22
60,Party town,"The location is great , lobby is amazing. The lifts are scary and small . The rooms are nice but there’s no bottle water or coffee in the rooms. The hot water only goes to lukewarm. I recommend a visit .it is near a lot of restaurants and you can hear people partying at night.",3,2023,05,21
60,Unresponsible for booking (scam!!) and credit card charge!,"This hotel confirm our booking when they are fully booked. So we came to the hotel at midnight and got refer involuntarily to another chain hotel which is very lousy and small, with the same amount. I would not recommend this hotel if you are tired and with a big luggage, they could refer you anywhere :) and also, they charged our credit card twice!!! (One with cancellation) and when we came to the hotel it was such a long line to get an explanation. We leave without a solution because we have a short time here. I feel unwelcome to Barcelona and not gonna visit again sooner or later. Will try to email them and lets see how it goes with the bank at working hour. Will give you the photos of their lousy noisy and small hotel chain.",1,2023,05,19
60,Great location,"We had a great room overlooking La Rambla, great location, smooth check in, staff very helpful. Right in the heart of things, close to the Gothic quarter, the market, the shops, restaurants and bars. Air con worked bug was a little noisy but ok with ear plugs",4,2023,05,12
60,"Brilliant location, no good if like sleep.","Brilliant location, doesn’t get better. However it is noisy on a night from outside, and right next to a youth hostel with young people shouting at all hours! The walls are paper thin, we have very loud Israeli neighbours, we didn’t sleep a wink on the first night. Staff were great and moved us rooms which was a little better but still, if you want a good peaceful nights sleep do not stay so central. The rooms were clean and beds made with fresh towels daily. The first room had no fridge, however when moved we had a fridge. Rooms as basic, you are literally staying here for location only! Air on was not controllable, it was on or off and no control for heating! Thankfully we were fine, but if had been a little cooler would have been cold. Beds very comfy, pillows very comfy. We stayed in a quad room and had 4 full sized beds which was great. Rooms were spacious. Bathroom a little small but shower very powerful and hot water no problem.",3,2023,05,11
60,Bad experience,"A very old hotel. They provide you with one physical key for your room!!! I thought hotels went to digital key 40 years ago. They did not. And if you lose your key - there is no way you can get to your room and need to pay a penalty for losing the key. 
You may want to look for better hotel choices",1,2023,05,08
60,Great hotel in a superb location,"I must admit that when i visit Barcelona for the football i usually stay at the Hotel Roma Reial but this was full due to booking quite late so decided to stay at the Oriente Atiram.
This turned out to be a great choice as this hotel is much better then my usual one and the location is just as good if not better located on Las Rambla 3 minutes from Liceu metro station and all the restaurants bus stops all on your door stop.
The train station at Placa Catalunya is a 10 mnute walk as are many of the shops and the beach is around a 10-15 minute walk.
On arrival we were greeted by really friendly and English speaking staff on reception and check in took no more than 5 minutes.
We were given a room on the 4th floor and there are two lifts but maximum capacity is three people , the room was clean and spacious with nice walk in shower and free toiletries and wifi was good too.
Room was cleaned everyday and all the staff were really friendly and the hotel from what i could see was Disabled and wheel chair friendly.
Breakfast was from 7-11am and there was a selection of hot and continental which included scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage , boiled eggs , cereal, fruit, Yoghurt, croissant , cake cold meats, cheese and much more.
The hotel was clean throughout and if you needed any help reception were there to help and they also will book airport transfers for you if you require  but we booked our own transfer through Hoppa as it was cheapest  which took 15-20 minutes but you could get metro or bus.
Even though we were on Ramlas we did not hear any noise apart from Metro when trains went by but this stopped at around midnight and we enjoyed really good night sleeps.
Overall i really enjoyed my stay here and also have to say it was one of my best trips to the wonderful city of Barcelona and i would certainly stay and recommend  this hotel.

60,Love this Hotel,"Absolutely PERFECT place to stay!
  Historic building is spectacular. Rooms updated and clean. Great water pressure, cold a/c. 
Staff is AWESOME…pleasant, friendly, knowledgeable and bilingual. 
   Breakfast team and housekeeping teams are just as Awesome!
  Location is the BEST in Barcelona. IF you don’t stay here, you’ll regret it. 
  We had had soundproof room and black out curtains… both work Great.  
    Breakfast had a nice variety from pastries, different meats, cheeses, eggs and many fruit juices.  Also toast, fresh fruits and coffee machines!  Even cereal for the kids. 
    ",5,2023,05,05
60,Great location,"The hotel itself is ok. I’ve stayed in worse, but I’ve stayed in better too. It was just a few small things that let this hotel down really.
The location is great - right on La Rambla, and right by Liceu metro station. There’s also a great tapas place just around the corner, Güell Tapas, where I ate most nights, and a great place for breakfast opposite (down the road opposite and just off to the right), Brunch & Cake, where I had the BEST eggs Benedict every morning when I didn’t have to leave early to go on a day tour (breakfast is available at an extra cost at the hotel, but I didn’t bother - I prefer to eat out, especially when the only choice is a continental breakfast). My room wasn’t facing La Rambla thankfully, so it was quieter, however, I could still hear the rumbling of the metro underneath the building every minute or two, which was extremely annoying. I wouldn’t say it disturbed my sleep, but it was very irritating. 
I didn’t find the bed particularly comfortable, and because of this, I didn’t sleep well. I woke up every morning for the first 6 days or so in knots. The pillows were comfortable, though.
The room (325) was small, but adequate for one person. It’s the colour I disliked most - the dark brown wood is so oppressive. Some lighter colours would be much better - whites, light greys and pale blues, and maybe some nice pictures of the Costa Brava or something to make the room a more calming environment.
The bathroom was small but adequate for one person. There was a shower but no bath, which is fine, however the shower is very temperamental. It has variable pressure and temperature. Standing under the shower, the pressure and temperature would often change. Sometimes the shower wouldn’t even warm up, and once I had a cold shower. Not freezing cold, but still cold. The tap was the same - it often took a long time for the water from the tap to heat up, if it heated up at all.
Free wifi was available in the hotel, which worked well.
Good storage for clothes - plenty of shelves, as well as some wardrobe space, however, an ironing board and iron were not provided.
Bed made and fresh towels given daily.
Wake up calls available upon request - I requested one when leaving due to a very early pickup for the airport, and they called me on time.
Check ins and check outs very chaotic. Although mine was fine due to my late arrival and departure times, a lot of people seemed to arrive and leave at the same time, and the process took absolutely ages, which is an issue when you’re a guest with a problem that needs sorting - you have to stand there for ages. And people don’t seem to know how to queue! I got in the queue as my key card wouldn’t work so I couldn’t get into my room - one queue, and the next person in the queue would go to the next available receptionist - but then people decided to make three separate queues, so people who came after me went ahead of me! There should be more order at the reception desk with clear signage in order to avoid this. Staff need to take charge. 
A word of warning too - this hotel seems to be very popular with large school groups, so if you think you’re going to avoid kids by going away during the school term, think again. You’re likely to have more! And they’re even worse when they’re in a large school group like this, away from the watchful eyes of their parents!
There is a safe in the room, but you need a key for it. You pay €10 for it, which is returned to you when you hand the key back in at the end of your stay. I’d suggest asking for it during check in to save you going back down for it. 
There are plenty of pharmacies nearby, and little supermarkets too (small Spar style shops) for basics, such as toiletries, bottles of pop, snacks, sandwiches etc. Everything you need is within easy walking distance. The location really is fantastic, especially if you have a room facing away from La Rambla (which could be noisy otherwise), it’s just the rumbling noise from the metro that disrupts the quieter rooms. ",3,2023,05,05
60,High price for a cheap hostel experience,"When we checked in we were originally given a twin room, but asked for a double. The air-conditioning in the room we were given did not work. We raised this with the reception staff on the first night and asked if they could unlock the windows. We were not offered a different room. The windows were unlocked but because there was no latch or other system to hold the windows open, the noise of their movement prevented sleep so we had to ask reception to lock the windows again at 2am. The window was so antiquated that the staff member was unable to lock one of the windows so we had to wedge it to keep it from banging. The terrible quality of sleep on the first night was surpassed on the second night as we suffocated in a hot room with no ventilation. My partner suffered a panic attack during the night because the room was so claustrophobic. We ended up propping the door open to enable some air to circulate, leaving us feeling vulnerable and insecure. 

To exacerbate what was already an awful experience, a party was going on in one of the rooms near ours. We complained to the reception staff twice during the night and the ineffective staff temporarily reduced the noise when people briefly left the room, but each time the partying guests returned and the noise resumed. 

We checked out at 7am, not because we had somewhere else to go, but because we couldn’t bear to be in the room for a moment longer than was necessary. 

We paid a high price for an experience that was significantly worse than many of the low cost hostel dorms we have stayed in while travelling. The poor standard of the room ruined my birthday celebration. We have had more comfortable experiences in hotels that cost a third of the price of the room in Oriente Atiram hotel. ",1,2023,04,27
60,Great location,The location of the hotel is fantastic right in the centre of the Ramblas. The reception staff were very helpful whenever we had any questions. Rooms were very clean & spacious but pretty basic. Tea & coffee making facilities would have been a welcome addition. Breakfast was served from 7-11 and always a good choice. ,4,2023,04,23
60,Some rooms need a PROPER update. Great service by Victor on front desk. Staff were all wonderful. ,"Initially given a VERY dated room (not nice) with only 1 socket, old beds/wardrobe and no tea/coffee facilities. Was moved to a far nicer, updated room with a balcony. Much much nicer all around. All old rooms need to be updated . Victor on front desk was AMAZING and made everyone feel welcome. Lobby is stunning but more work needs to be done to bring all the hotel to a newer standard. Great location! ",4,2023,04,10
60,Fantastic location ,"Great central.location on la rambla main high street so step out on to safe well pedestrianised area and metro only a 2/3 min walk

Amazing welcome with large lobby.
Reception staff really polite and helpful as we asked for directions and recommendations for our 4 day stay.

Breakfast was minimal but suffient to start the day.
Room service limited with no iron, tea/coffee facilities which you would expect in a hotel of this standard.
Housekeeping mainted and freshend the rooms daily.
Would recommend highly as great value for money",4,2023,03,30
60,Characterful in the center of Barcelona,"A wonderful surprise.I had read some revievs that were not too complimentary og the hotel. These people have come to the wrong place.The Oriente is a hotel full of unique character,so who cares if it may be showing its age in certain places,that is its wonderful charm.
The staff cannot be more helpful and friendly.
I have only been here one day of eight so everything will only get better.
The hotel is central ,with restaurants ,bars and shops only a short stroll away😁",5,2023,03,28
60,Charming hotel,"We stayed Monday - Friday so didn’t experience the weekend, which I can imagine is a little livelier. We had a deluxe room on the 4th floor overlooking La Rambla. Yes there was a little noise but to be honest we were exhausted after exploring all day , it never bothered us at all. Our room was immaculately clean and serviced every day. Beds were extremely comfy too. Toiletries were provided, but we had our own. Breakfast was continental and plenty on offer to keep you going till lunch. Staff always on hand if needed and extremely helpful. Hotel was a perfect base to explore Barcelona. Near to the metro & the tourist buses. We ate in the square opposite, where you could find every cuisine possible with street entertainment thrown in. Would definitely stay here again. Great value for money. Just be aware of the street traders , they have no boundaries especially when you are eating outside.",5,2023,03,26
60,A classic in Barcelona,"The hotel takes you back to the classical period of the 60s in terms of its look and feel. The entrance and lobby is really well done. The rooms are spacious and beds comfortable. 

The rooms have the adequate comforts, but a few modern amenities like a kettle would have made the room even better. 

Dining options outside the hotel are more than plenty and it’s a very touristy place. 

I would have loved a slightly larger spread (variety of options) for the breakfast. 

Overall a good stay in Barcelona",4,2023,03,26
60,Great location for exploring,"My wife and I stayed for 3 nights in a room on the 4th floor overlooking la Rambla. The hotel is a beautiful old building yet rooms feel modern, bathroom was fine with toiletries provided and a powerful hot shower. We took teabags but there were tea/coffee making facilities provided. We didn’t have breakfast so cannot comment on that but breakfast area looked light and airy and plenty of other guests were taking advantage of the service.
The hotel is in the perfect spot for getting around this amazing city, you can walk up and down La Rambla, the beach and ports are within walking distance and there are at least 3 metro stops nearby which we used to get across to the camp Nou.
As others have said there is some street noise if you have a balcony overlooking La Rambla but it all adds to the experience in our opinion.

60,Lovely Hotel,"Great location on Las Ramblas, very close to Liceu metro station. 
Rooms are small, but clean. 

You can extend your checkout at a rate of €10 per hour extra. I got to the hotel quite early, however like most places they won't give you your room until 2pm at the earliest. ",4,2023,03,09
60,10/10,"Very neat and tidy room, the balcony was facing the la rambla as described.. Super friendly staff, especially the receptionist Victor! He gave us the best recommendations in town and we will definitely be coming back soon!",5,2023,03,01
60,"Central, convenient, very comfy bed, helpful staff and beautiful lobby","The hotel entrance is stunning, the staff very helpful with any enquiries we had, they held our bags on the last day free of charge.  We chose a room with a view on to the La Rambles, it was quiet but lovely to wake up to see the hustle and bustle on a morning, we were very lucky to wake to blue skies in February too. The hotel is very convenient for the port, sightseeing and shopping, very central. We got a taxi from the airport costing €35 but the airport bus was cheap and a short walk away for our journey back. The beds were extremely comfy as well as the pillows, the room spacious and clean. We would definitely return.",5,2023,02,18
60,Step back in time,"It feels like you’ve stepped back in time when you walk into this hotel. Our room on the third floor was very spacious, the only things that let it down were no tea or coffee facilities and the corner shower  unit was a little on the small side. There was a fridge in the unit under the tv, which we made good use of storing drinks. We had a balcony view facing Las Ramblas, and although yes it was noisy at night and you could hear the rumblings of the metro, but once I put my earplugs in (have to wear as hubby snores), I couldn’t really hear anything. The bed and pillow some might say was a little on the hard side, but I prefer that. There was a hairdryer in the bathroom.
Breakfast let it down though. It had two drinks machines for coffee and tea, juice, milk and water were in jugs, then it had either cornflakes or cocoa pops for cereal, a choice of pastries, cakes, cold meats and cheeses and variety of different flavoured yogurts, fruits, but lacking in the ‘hot’ area with just scrambled egg and bacon (no sausages, eggs, beans, tomatoes etc). There was a toaster if you fancied toast though, and that was about it.",4,2023,02,16
60,Short Barcelona break,"The hotel is ideally placed as a base to explore the city, close to the metro. Rooms are very comfortable with all amenities on hand. Staff are friendly and helpful. We’ve stayed here numerous times and would recommend ",5,2023,02,13
60,Stolen property,"Our stay at the oriente atrium was very mid, we paid a lot for our room and were greeted with a very lovely lobby excited for our stay. When we got to our room there were no tea or coffee facilities, there was a door in our shower to the outside that would rattle and let the breeze in making the room very cold, the room has less facilities than a budget hotel. Not only this but when we checked out I left a jacket in the room, a very expensive one at that, I contacted the hotel after our stay and was willing to get family members we have in barcalona to go and collect it, we heard nothing back from the hotel, the rooms were also not sound proof, after a breezy and loud few sleeps in the hotel this was the worst way to end our trip. The only good thing is the location which is very good. If you’re wanting a nice cozy place to relax you’re better off in a hostel. ",2,2023,02,09
60,"Baby, it’s cold outside!","Unfortunately, we’ve been traveling to Barcelona in January, not the properly month to do so because of the weather. It was cold outside and inside, cuz the hotel room wasn’t warm at all. During the night we were almost frozen.
The best part of this hotel is the position, near about every important tourist attraction, but if we knew before that there is gonna be so cold inside, for sure we would have chosen another hotel.",3,2023,02,02
60,Ideal location,"We have chosen this hotel twice already. Ideal location, everything fits, and I like it. The friendly and caring staff takes into account the needs of the client. The rooms with a balcony are very nice and the view from that balcony is amazing!",5,2023,01,27
60,Nice stay,"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel, the great breakfast and the perfect location, comfy room… the only problem was the heating for one night. I choose the simple room so it was ok and economic. Could walk everywhere … the hall was amazing.",4,2023,01,18
60,Horrible stay,"We have stayed here previously but will not in the future.  The staff were very rude and were not accommodating at all when safety issues were brought to their attention.  Management did not even respond to follow up enquires. Front staff were very rude upon check-in as well as general questions.
 Breakfast is not a breakfast.  It is over priced toast and juice.  Don't bother and go outside to the plenty of restaurant options.
This is too bad as we stayed here before and thought it was great, but this last time left a sour taste in our mouth and we will not be returning back here.",1,2023,01,09
60,A nice place but very loud.,"If you like the hustle and bustle of Las Ramblas and don't mind the noise, this is a great place. The A/C was not very good but we just stayed one night so we did not let it bother us too much.  The lobby looks like a movie set. The staff was cordial. Taxis are readily available just outside the door. ",4,2022,12,04
60,My Second Visit to this Hotel,"Fantastic second stay in this hotel as came here last year too. Hotel very central to everything and situated on the iconic La Ramblas. Very clean room , excellent reception staff all of whom were so friendly. Prices very competitive too. 
will definitely stay again and thank you Barcelona you were amazing once again ",5,2022,12,01
60,Great position,"Great stay. Top floor. Nice and quiet but at the back so not a great view. Right on ramblas so easy for everything. 
Metro is close and east to use. 
Lots of bars and restraunts very close. 
Uber was €22 from the airport. 
Fantastic lobby in the hotel.",4,2022,11,19
60,Beautiful location and welcoming staff,"The level of service that I received from the staff cannot be described. I showed up  6:30 in the morning with my luggage and no place to go. heck in wasn't until 12 and I was beat but they offered to store my luggage while I walked around. The Gothic quarter is unbelievable , you have to see it. A little while later I walked back to the gorgeous lobby and went to take a seat on one of the couches in the lobby while waiting for check in.   The front desk would not let that happen! They went out of there way to find me a room that I could check in to right away. That kind of service just doesn't exist anymore.",5,2022,10,28
60,Perfect location. Great hotel,"What a lovely hotel, felt like we had stepped back to the 1920s,  a unique hotel.  Perfect location right on Las Ramblas.  We were on the 3rd floor  it was a little noisy but you have to expect that, it didnt bother us.  Lovely breakfast.  We paid extra for a deluxe room, free tea and coffee and mini bar with soft drinks and snacks which was refilled each day, well worth it.  We stayed for 3 full days, 4 nights.  We will defo be coming back to fabulous Barcelona and stay at this hotel.

We jumped a taxi from the airport as we hadnt been to Barcelona before, cost 30 euros, and got a taxi back to the airport.  There is a bus to and from the airport, cheap, but we just preferred a taxi.",5,2022,10,19
60,"Excellent Location,Rooms terrible","Excellent location all round. We were on the 3rd floor. Basic room and had the thinnest walls ever. Can hear the next rooms talking. Also the light rumbling of the metro can be heard. The breakfast is very minimal not worth 12€. 
Good location at the bottom of La Ramblas. Loads of Bars (which show premier league football) coffee and patisseries shops
Metro station close to the hotel which goes directly to camp nou.",3,2022,10,13
60,We loved this historic hotel!,"Barcelona was the last stop on a long trip my husband and I just took, so we experienced many hotels. In addition to the location, we loved the attention to detail — the clever owners of Hotel Oriente keep several original 1842 touches, which added to the charm. And though we faced La Rambla and had a teeny terrace, the windows are 100 percent soundproof. 

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the complimentary breakfast was lovely. Our deluxe room, though sparsely furnished, was huge, too.",5,2022,10,11
60,Great place to stay,Room and location (especially the comfy bed and pillows) were excellent. Would have given 5 stars if couple of bottles of water in fridge and tea and coffee sachet next to kettle. Staff were lovely. Convenient luggage drop facilities for before and after check in/out,4,2022,10,11
60,Excellent location!,"The staff was very attentive. The room was very clean and spacious. You can’t beat this location for the price, we walked everywhere and taxis were very accessible for far away attractions. We also took the airbus to the airport and was just a short walk from the hotel.",5,2022,10,09
60,Good sleep,Perfect location. Very touristic but very easy to go everywhere just walking. Very silent room. Confortable bed. Good shower. However the floor gets wet all over. I didn't have breakfast there though. I prefered to try places nearby,4,2022,09,26
60,Hotel is run down.,"There was mold in the bathroom, the room was very small,there was no blind so we had  to close the shutters, service is at best average.  well located on the rambla near gothic quarter. Too expensive for what you get!",1,2022,09,16
60,Perfect hotel in the hart of Barcelona,"Great hotel on the Ramblas. Perfect for an activ and cultural stay at walking distance of metrostation.
4 pers room was really large enough, clean bathroom and big enough wardrobe.
Breakfast was as expected, not over-varied but enough choice for everyone and tasty.",5,2022,09,13
60,Historic Beauty in the Gothic Area,"Beautiful older hotel with so much character! Really clean, lovely staff, great food, and right in the heart of the Gothic area with so much to do and see. Everything is right at your doorstep. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2022,09,12
60,nice and happy stay,"we have been in this hotel for two nights, the location is the best in Barcelona, service excellent, breakfast can be much better but no complaint, there is parking nearby with a good fee. very clean and friendly staff.",5,2022,09,12
60,Very poor service,Air conditioning in the room was broken and wasn’t fixed in the week we were there. We spoke to another couple who had the same problem. My daughter had terrible mosquito bites which swelled up one night and the hotel wouldn’t give us any ice to help bring the swelling down. Very unfriendly concierge.,1,2022,09,04
60,Amazing hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"Although a bit dated, this hotel is fantastic in all the ways that really matter

Fantastic service
Old world charm and character
Central location
Air conditioned rooms
Clean and comfortable beds
Fluffy towels
Decent toiletries

Would not hesitate to visit again!

A special thanks to Dani at reception for helping us with our special request.",5,2022,08,29
60,Best location,"I would highly recommend this hotel with a caveat. Best location, beautiful lobby and historic structure and very friendly and helpful staff. But the AC barely worked which was not too pleasant on a stuffy August night. It was a good price at a great location but was only an adequate room.",4,2022,08,27
60,Adorable hotel in the Best location ever,"Although the rooms are small, the location makes up for everything. Hotel Oriente is a quaint old world building located right on the Ramblas. Making it the ideal location for a tourist desiring “the Barcelona experience”. Within walking distance is the famous Bouqueria market, and the gothic quarter and almost every good restaurant or shopping.",4,2022,08,21
60,TERRIBLY BAD! They ruined our honeymoon,"It was the worst hotel we been to in our entire life. At first my booking was canceled for no reason at 2/3am prior our arrival even Front desk agent didn’t know why. Don’t expect someone to smile at you (basic of hospitality). We had no AC for 3 nights, we couldn’t sleep and we even didn’t want to have a nap due to the room temperature (we were sweating few minutes only after getting in the room) and they were only telling us that they have nothing to do for us (no other options offered). The room was dirty, towels all marked with either makeup or nail polish, hair on the floor, rest of someone’s hair on the toilet seat. Worst hotel I have ever been to. We ended up making a checkout earlier than planned and they couldn’t even make a gesture on nights spent in HELL with 32 degrees and no AC. Hotel poorly managed as managers were all not there with a hotel broken with no AC, wifi partially working 1 day out of 3 spent, and Housekeeping have to be trained properly.
HONESTLY JUST DON’T GO THERE !",1,2022,08,14
60,Highly NOT Recommended,"Except the “prime” location nothing is real! Picture provided on your website are not even close what you get! And if you request the upgrade , you won’t be provided with a double bed. When you you should receive it with a fridge you won’t get either. When you are communicating with the front desk, you get ignored, same as for the refund! If you think you will get and iron , answer “why would you need an iron”! Make sure you don’t leave any personal belongings behind, cause you won’t see them anymore. ZERO customer care, ZERO solution finder = Zero Reason to Recommend nor to come back",1,2022,07,15
60,Worst hotel experience we have ever had,"Probably one of the worst hotel experiences we’ve ever had. It started at check-in where we had specifically called to make sure that they assigned us a room with one bed but when checking in they gave us one with two. We went back down and they gave us another room still with two beds and finally found a room with one bed which was a downgrade from what we had booked…fine, no problem…
The room was at the end of the hotel, with no view and a terrible bathroom where you couldn’t even fit two people. And they forgot to tell us they didn’t have an iron in the room and was told when we asked that we had to bring our items downstairs only early in the morning for pressing. Something that should have been mentioned to us before!

The worst part of this, is that I had forgotten a dress for a wedding, that was custom made, I had hung in the wardrobe along with a jean jacket and a white shirt (the only things I hung out). After an hour and a half of check out I had contacted the hotel to let them know of those items and they said to call back later. After we touched down and left the airport I called again and they said that it’s Sunday and perhaps no one had logged in anything as it’s usually a “lazy day” and said to call back the next day. I did so and I was told that none of the items I spoke of were found.
I was livid and wrote an email to ask the hotel to investigate. And after many back and forth emails (and phone calls that were never replied to) the hotel, or whoever I was dealing with on the other end of those emails, said that the only person that entered the room was housekeeping and on the camera footage they were the only ones that went in to the room and apparently didn’t find anything…

All of this to say that they even went as far to say that I probably didn’t forget anything and that I was mistaken….they were unprofessional and dismissed everything….

I would not recommend anyone to go there, especially as it is not safe to keep anything there! I have now lost all of my things and was basically told that I was lying about having forgotten anything in the wardrobe to begin with",1,2022,07,14
60,Only if you insist on staying on Ramblas,"The only good thing about this hotel is the location - literally on Ramblas.  
I booked this as my flight was cancelled so I had an extra day and my sister had already booked this hotel.  For the price, there are plenty of nicer options around.  
It us a lovely historic building with a beautiful lobby.  Staff were friendly and helpful. 
I booked a twin room - the beds were acceptable, it had old style AC unit which did the trick.  Small fridge which was quite noisy at night.  There was a safe but not sure how to use - it looked like you needed a key.  
The bedroom looked really dates, we had a view of emergency stair well in a central courtyard. 
The bathroom was a modern design.  Shower holder was broke so I had to hold the shower.  It’s also positioned for really tall people and mot adjustable.  The hair dryer was fine. 

Overall, i didn’t think it was good value for money.  Had my sister not booked, I most certainly would have booked elsewhere.  Barcelona is walkable so it’s not necessary to pay a premium to stay on Ramblas.",3,2022,07,09
60,"Excellent Staff, Miserly Ownership","What a beautiful and historic building, gorgeous lobby and fabulous front desk staff!  Only if the management/ownership actually cared about the place and the customers it would be complete package!

Imagine a room for 4 with no fridge!  In fact there was a slot for a fridge in the cabinet and even a plug for it just behind the cabinet -- but no fridge!  The tub was so badly clogging that there was a line dirt on the tub following any shower. The AC did not work in the first room they gave us; but Tariq from the front desk staff staff saved the night by providing us with an oscillating fan.

The next day, they let us move to a room with a working AC, but, again no fridge and the shower curtain already had a line of dirt at the bottom!

None of the issues would be too difficult to fix if the ownership actually cared.  [Marked it as mid-range assuming the high price was due to the season and global inflation, otherwise, it really was pretty high priced...]",3,2022,07,08
60,☆☆☆☆☆ Convenience ♡♡♡♡♡,"To be on the Ramblas is the best thing to do and for the price I got, it was weel worth it as location is steps from Metro, on the street accessible to taxis and they have parking close by available although not used it. Literally you are within steps of anything and everything from food to shopping and entertainment. It is also 30 min walk from the beach which the walk itself is a pleasure.

The hotel is unique with that the reception is at the far  end of the entrance to it with a huge lobby/courtyard area with simple but comfortable bamboo seating. There is history everywhere and shows in deace looking walls, paintings and some antiques scattered around. But the club of it all is that the reception is not in your face and you don't have to go through it to get to your elevators or any other part. This is very unique and gave me a special relaxed atmosphere. Security is very out of sight and again very convenient. 

The rooms are very comfortable fr beds and pillows which are super to the bathroom that is big although may need to have some kind of extractor fan which did not exist in ours. Noise levels in this noisy area are very acceptable as balcony doors are sound proof to a good standard. Ros are kept super clean.

The staff are very nice and genuinely relaxed which tells a lot about behind the scenes management team. Kudos to them.

If u would look for any negatives, I would say a coffee tray in ro and mini fridge would have helped.

All in all. A great two week stay.",4,2022,07,07
60,Very basic room not like what is shown in the photos,"We booked a quadruple room for 4 nights. The room & beds are not what the photos showed. The big bottles of shampoo & bath soup were taken away from us after the first night and were replaced by 3 small bottles for 4 persons! We asked for more but were given various combinations (leftovers?) No fridge, no kettle. The cost is very expensive for a 3-star hotel!",3,2022,07,06
60,"Great Location,","We stayed at the hotel for 20 nights.  Metro Sation and Bus Stop are really near to the hotel. 

The Ramblas Deluxe room has a nice view of the Ramblas, but the street noise filters all the way up. (Their windows don't work well canceling the noise).  Although we booked a king bed, we got 2 twin beds put together, which made sleeping uncomfortable.  The metro shaking/vibrating of the room didn't help much either.

If traveling in summer, you must know that the air conditioning doesn't work very well and the room won't keep cool or you won't be able to put the temperature you want. The magnetic cards stop working every 4 days, and it was a pain getting new ones.

The staff, in general, is very friendly but some of them need more training.",2,2022,07,05
60,"Beautiful old hotel with wonderful , Friendly & helpful staff.",This grand hotel is beautiful and family friendly. The staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. The breakfast was lovely (although I did wonder why the milk in the coffee machine was sweet)… Overall an exceptional trip! (Highly recommended: go to the restaurant la Cañete very close by!),5,2022,07,04
60,Amazing location but that’s about it,"We stayed here for a week in June 2022. It was clean and it has an incredible location on Las Ramblas, with Metro station and Bus Stop outside the door. It also has a lovely reception area. However…. That’s where it stops. There are no basic amenities such as tea and coffee in the room, the bed was a pull out sleeper couch which was incredibly uncomfortable and the shower was inside the bath with a mouldy shower curtain. Not what you’d expect paying over €100 a night. I’d have been better off at a backpackers lodge and saved a ton of money.",2,2022,07,01
60,"Totally different to what we expected, for worse.","We stayed at Oriente Hotel for 5 nights and it is not a Hotel I would like to come back again in the future. Although they allowed us to check in earlier, the room was awful. Tinny smelly room (as if someone had been smoking the night before). The air conditioner was very old and did not work well. The windows could not be opened and we had to make an effort to close the room´s door each time we entered or leave the room. Breakfast was also something to forget: no variety and bad coffee. Positive things: location and personal.",2,2022,06,30
60,Perfect location,"Hotel is in a fantastic location, we had a family room which had a fridge, kettle and hairdryer room was fine and cleaned each day. Only reason I gave a 4 was the night staff on reception when we checked didn’t even acknowledge we were stood at the desk, finally acknowledged after a good 5/10 min then it was about another 20 min befor we finally got to our room. Staff of a day time very pleasant and helpful. Hotel we found to be very clean and great for a base, we didn’t have breakfast at the hotel so cannot comment on the food.",4,2022,06,25
60,Better than expected,"After reading some previous reviews I wasn't expecting great things, but the hotel was better than I had envisaged. 
Our room was a good size. Ok it was a bit tired but very clean. The towels where pure white as where the bedding. The bathroom needed a bit of TLC and I hate shower curtains ! But again very clean. The beds and pillows where very comfy and we slept like babies. Las Ramblas is buzzing and our small balcony overlooked it. You expect it to be noisy in the city center but once the doors where closed you couldn't here a thing. Never had a problem with noise from other guests. Yes you can here the underground but that didn't bother us either. The aircon wasn't great. Just cool. There's a small fridge that kept drinks cool it just needs to be running s while to get cold.
Breakfast was adequate and pleasant but not a great selection and the same everyday.  The breakfast room was attractive, clean and well organised with pleasant staff. 
The reception area is old and grand and I feel they could have made more of this area. Perhaps a small bar and background music as it lacked ambience. 
All in all its not a grand hotel and is in need of TLC in places but we couldn't complain and we enjoyed our stay.
Oh and take your own tea and coffee as only kettle and disposal cups are provided in the rooms. A small selection of drinks can be purchased at reception.",4,2022,06,24
60,"HORRIBLE, DISGUSTING EXPERIENCE","We stayed at Oriente Atiram from 19 june to 22 june total 3 nights.it was really a painful experience.

1) as our train from Valencia was late we reached the hotel at around 3.4o pm and still our room was not ready.we had to wait for 15/20 minutes for the room.
2) room was on 1st floor and in the night the loud noise and vibrations of the underground metro was really disturbing.so if you want a silent sleep do not make a mistake of booking this hotel.
3) next day morning when we went for breakfast the lady there told us that we have to pay for the breakfast inspite of booking room with breakfast,it took 15 minutes for them to clear this confusion with the reception and finally they apologised and allowed us in.
4) our room telephone was not working,(inspite of complaint it never worked till We left the hotel)we went to reception to ask for extra pillows but the answer we got was as the hotel is full there are no extra pillows..can you imagine this in a so called 3star hotel.
5) when we went for city tour we put the tag for room cleaning,when we came back in the night we were shocked to see that room as it was and not even the towels changed .we again went to reception to hear a nonsense reply without even an opology that as there is no cleaning staff at that time nothing can be done .it was the case with most of the rooms as we could see the trash left outside the adjusent room..see the picture attached.
6)on the 3rd day when we came back from a hectic day and wanted to have hot shower,there was no hot water at all . again we went to reception and asked the guy there but again the same answer.. there is no maintenance staff at this hour...
7) if you have read all this and thought that our ordeal was over...no we had another shock.AT THE TIME OF CHECK IN THEY ASKED FOR 50 EURO CASH DEPOSIT AS WE WERE NOT CARRYING ANY CARDS WE GAVE IT BUT WITHOUT RECIEPT.WHEN AT THE TIME OF CHECK OUT I ASKED THE GUY AT THE RECEPTION FOR DEPOSIT REFUND ,THAT GUY ACTED AS IF HE HEARD THE WORD DEPOSIT FIRST TIME AND ACTED AS IF HE IS SEARCHING THE DEPOSIT ENVELOPE IN THE COUNTER AND SAID THERE IS NO ENVELOPE FOR OUR ROOM NUMBER....THEN WHEN WE RAISED THE VOICE THE OTHER GUY AT THE RECEPTION INTERVINED AND FINALLY WE GOT OUR CASH BACK.THE GUY NAMED PULIO OR JULIO WAS SO SHAMELESS THAT HE TOLD ME OPENLY TO WRITE A BAD REVIEW AS IF HE HAS BACKING OF  THE MANAGEMENT TO DO SUCH THINGS.I HAVE TRAVELLED TO SO MANY COUNTRIES AND STAYED AT SO MANY HOTELS...LET ME TELL YOU THIS GUY WAS THE RUDEST, SHAMELESS AND WORST GUY EVER.
YOU MUST HAVE HEARD ABOUT BARCELONA 'S REPUTATION AS CAPITOL OF PICKPOCKETING...BUT THAT RECEPTIONIST TRYING TO STEAL YOUR DEPOSIT IS A HORRIFYING EXPERIENCE.
I AM WRITING AN EMAIL TO THE HOTEL MANAGEMENT ABOUT THIS USELESS GUY JULIO/PULIO EXPECTING SOME ACTION FROM THEM.
EVERYTHING HERE IS ABSOLUTE TRUTH AND MY FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE.....SO PLEASE DON'T DO THE MISTAKE OF BOOKING THIS HORRIBLE PLACE AND SAVE YOUR MONEY.",1,2022,06,23
60,Rude staff & horrible hospitality,"I was unable to give this hotel a zero, so I had to give it a one. I had booked a double room for two nights 3/4 months in advance, after my long travel to Barcelona, I went to check in at 5 pm. By horrific surprise, the man at the front desk told me that they had canceled my reservation because my ""payment was not accepted"" and they had sent me an email. I checked my email, 4 hours prior to my check in they canceled my reservation with no warning, no attempt to call me, and no option to try another form of payment. This was quite literally the opposite of hospitable, the staff was rude and literally said ""bye"", left us with nowhere to stay and was completely disrespectful. As someone who works in the hospitality field, I was and still am appalled by the way this hotel conducts business. Please do not give this hotel any business, I ended up staying at a much better hotel a short 3 minute walk away called Catalonia Avinyo with incredible staff with gorgeous rooms and amenities.",1,2022,06,22
60,Not real happy with this stay,"Have to go to the outside bar for ice and then the guy tried to charge me for the cup he was putting it in.  Went back to my room for another cup!   They're not very pleasant when getting ice either! 

Keys don't work 1/2 the time and needed to get them replaced 4 times! 

Just didn't see the value for what we paid.",2,2022,06,15
60,Okay but could be better.,Okay but could be better.  Rooms are very basic and run down but clean.  Staff are nice and helpful.  The lobby is lovely but the rest of the hotel needs some love.  The bathroom had been updated but the floor of the shower is now cracked.,3,2022,06,11
60,Acceptable but could be better,"The hotel was very clean and convenient. The workers were friendly. However, the neighborhood was a bit noisy. The movement of the metro would often vibrate the walls, which was annoying on the first floor (not sure about upper levels).",3,2022,06,09
60,Expensive and inefficient,"I stayed 2 nights in a small room for 900 € which i think is rather expensive. At 14pm the room was not available on arrival. The agent at the desk was not friendly and I had to wait in a long queue. Payment on arrival.
The breakfast next morning was the minimum you can offer to legally call it a breakfast. Coffee from a self service machine, some fruits, yoghurt.
When I left 2 nights later I dropped the keycard and a very rude agent talked to me. I said it is all settled already and he talked to me like a customs officer from North Korea. No good buy or safe travels, nothing. Unbelievable personal.",1,2022,06,09
60,Step Back in Time,What a beautiful Hotel in the center of Barcelona (in the Gothic Quarter).  The Lobby was like stepping back in time (a good thing).  It is directly across from the Plaza Real where there are a lot of indoor/outdoor cafes.  The rooms were spacious and the internet was very fast.  The staff was very helpful and courteous.  The subway vibrates the building and the streets can be noisy late at night.,4,2022,06,02
60,Lovely to look at but that’s all.,"We arrived for a two night stay (having stayed a week earlier for an addt’l two nights). Our first trip our beds were terribly uncomfortable so this check in I asked if there was a room with more comfortable beds. We were told a bed topper would be added and while it wasn’t a typical topper it helped. We asked for a room
 Off the Rambla (none available); we asked for a high floor (none available). The room had NO luggage rack; NO tissues; and NO shelf in bathroom for toiletries. The kettle to heat water was plastic and too hot to handle. All I can say great location, very good breakfast but the rooms are tired and need a big update.",2,2022,05,30
60,Barcelona Heaven,"This is our 3rd & 4th time staying at Oriente, the first 2 stays was in 2013 during our very fist Mediterranean cruise. We loved it so much that we had no other pick for tour 2022 cruise.  

For our April 30-May 1 stay, the check in process was a breeze. We arrived at 9am, room wasn't ready yet and they stored our luggage for free. When we got in our room at 1pm, everything was really nice. The only issue we had, on which the staff apologized because of building problems, was the air conditioning. It got a bit warm in the evening so we opened the terrace door. It was a Saturday night, so La Ramblas was partying like crazy. We were so tired that we slept through the yelling and singing on the street.

May 8-10 stay: Check in was once again really quick that from leaving our cruise stateroom to check-in, it only took 30 minutes. This time was much better since we had a La Ramblas front room. The room was pristine, however, they were still having issues with the air conditioning, so we left the terrace door open again for the 2 nights. It was not as loud from our previous week stay, just the buses and motorcycle noise.

Overall, our stay was really relaxing. Kudos to the front desk staff. They were really very friendly, accommodation and professional. We will definitely stay at Oriente Hotel again.",5,2022,05,13
60,"Was so good, we’re going back…","We loved our stay here, we stayed twice in the same trip, going too and after a cruise.

Ideally situated near the port end of La Rambla with lots of bars and restaurants on the doorstep and a metro station 2 mins walk away at Liceu.

The beautiful hotel lobby which has stripped walls showing a taste of its original splendour, very helpful and accommodating staff at the front desk, and 2 lifts (or stairs if you rather) to the 4 floors of rooms. We were in a 4th floor room, then a 3rd floor room. Both rooms were very clean and had everything you would need, from a safe( key with returned deposit from reception), complimentary toiletries to very comfortable beds and great pillows. We had been worried about noise as the hotel is next to a Policia Urbana station and cars and bikes come and go with sirens and lights at all times of day and night but we can honestly say we didn’t hear a thing and slept like babies even with the aircon switched on low just to keep the air moving -otherwise you maybe get a bit hot and stuffy.

If you chose to have breakfast the breakfast room is bright, clean, has 2 coffee machines and as well as the expected continental selection of meats, cheeses, breads and yoghurt there is also scrambled egg and bacon. The staff are very solicitous at replenishing everything and making sure you find everything that you need.

All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful and are a credit to the hotel.

Our stay was so good, we’ve just booked to go back again and  are completely looking forward to it",5,2022,05,11
60,Affordable hotel in a great location.,Our room was very quiet considering it’s right on the main street. Excellent location right next to subway. Staff were amazing and helped us with any questions we had. The rooms were up to date and kept clean and maintained. Great experience overall.,5,2022,05,11
60,Long weekend in Barcelona,"Hotel and room was beautiful and located right in the middle of la ramblas, gave 4 stars as breakfast was very poor.  We had a deluxe room (208) with balcony over looking la  ramblas.  Room was spacious with tea coffee making facilities (not all rooms have them) with a bath and shower. Noise was minimal when doors were closed and you could hear the rumble of the underground trains but not intrusive.  Only let down was the breakfast, not much choice only Spanish bacon and congealed scrambled eggs for hot food.  Beans and sausage would be nice.  Luckily the continental choice was better so you could make a cheese and ham toastie. Lots of pastries and 2 cereal.  It would be nice if there was a little bar also as reception area very nice, it would be nice to enjoy a drink down there.  Will definitely be booking in the future.",4,2022,05,09
60,WARNING Hotel does not care about customers,"Last nightof our stay we hear very laud music. We thought was a party in one of the rooms. Our surprise was that the Hotel had a party under the section where our room was. 200€ for not being able to sleep until the party was over arounsd 3 am. UNBELIEVABLE!!

The Hotel offered a refund that so far we have not seen.

In addition our room was notsound proof and was not renew, very somber furniture",1,2022,05,04
60,A good break for 3 days in Barcelona with several vists - well worth doing.,"The room/bathroom was good. The only part that could be improved is the noise insulation as it sounded as if the window was open all night and it can get rather ""animated"" outside! The service in the hotel was also very good and the hotel location was very convienent enabling us to leave the car in the car park during our stay. The car park nearest to the hotel is NOT for a big car....best to go the the one a bit further away that has more space. Be warned, some of the bars on the Ramla can be extortionate...check the prices before ordering as we witnessed several ""scenes"" when the bill for two sangria's was 80 euros....no prices were published on the menu's...!",4,2022,05,02
60,Nice hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"Pros: Position. If Barcelona was a living organism, “La Rambla” boulevard is definitely the main artery, connecting the heart with the other body parts. Three minutes walk to “Liceu” metro station, or ten minutes walk to “Placa de Catlunya” or other important attractions such as “Barrio Gotico”, “La Boqueria”, “La Rambla del Mar” etc. General feeling you're in a classic movie. Green parrots are flying in the trees in front of your balcony. The lobby with the piano, classical furniture and plants is really special. They cleaned the room every day. The rooms and the bathrooms are basic but clean and with all that is strictly needed. The breakfast is good, the selection in the cold section is ok, but in the hot section they only serve scrambled eggs and fried ham. Nice stuff, reception included, special mention for Dani.
Cons: We stayed for nine days so completely the same breakfast every day is … a bit frustrating. The soundproofing to the exterior is quite good but the soundproofing between rooms and to the corridor needs to be improved. At this price the parking should be included.",4,2022,04,29
60,Awful rooms,"The rooms are nothing like what they show on their pictures. Tiny, just a bed occupying the whole space. The bed, which was advertised as a twin bed, was in fact a small double bed. I woke up at some point in the night thinking there was flooding, but it was just the neighbours having a shower. The noise was so loud that I woke up from it even while wearing custom made ear plugs. Breakfast was standard stuff from Aldi. The only good thing was the coffee, and the lobby looks great, but what point is a nice looking lobby, it's not where you sleep!",1,2022,04,27
60,Poor value for money at noisy location,"This hotel requires renovation. Very mediocre rooms with worn-out furniture and a bit uncomfortable beds. We stayed in a ""de luxe"" room with a view to the Ramblas. The street is noisy (not a surprise) but the fact that you can feel the metro as it passes by underneath was unexpected. The breakfast had a good selection but the coffee comes from a vending machine and all products are quite basic. In addition the breakfast room is noisy, too. On the positive side - well, outside the hotel looks nice and this would be a great place if renovated to match the glory of the past. The location is central. Also, the cleaning staff were friendly and did a good job. To summarize, all of this would be ok if the price was max 100 eur per room/night, but we paid the double. Not good value for money at all. ",3,2022,04,23
60,Poor service and rude front desk,"Absolute Tourist trap. The rooms are tiny, poorly appointed and the service is close to non existent. For 2 our of 3 nights the room was not made up despite my personal request at 9am at the front desk on the second day we returned mid-afternoon only to see that the room was yet again not made up. Instead of an apology we were told by the front desk that this was OUR mistake. This place costs a lot and has a good location. There are plenty of choices in this part of town and I would certainly not return, not even if the stay was for free.

60,great positions but  room  old and worn out,"Great Positions , in the middle of Rambla,  Rumors outside don't disturb the hotel's client.
The Staff is help full and friendly . Breakfast is very basic.
The negative side are the rooms. We had a standard room that look out at the courtyard, bed is very comfortable but the room was very old and damage . In my opinion we spent a lot for the room we had.",3,2022,04,08
60,Amazing hotel in the Gothic area.,"Fantastic service, fantastic location,we would stay here again , I saw on previous reviews that the hotel looked tired , I disagree the foyer is old and they've peeled back the layers so that you can see the stone ,hand painted wallpaper and the add one , the staff are extremely friendly when approached.
The Metro makes a noise and vibrates but that's not the hotel's fault , the only thing I would change is the room flooring but that's personal choice.",5,2022,04,01
60,Worth noting before you book,"I arrived on a Wednesday morning and had opted for a Las Ramblas view room with early check in. The staff are very helpful and friendly & first impression in the lobby is the place is wonderfully historic & interesting.

I was in room 109 and my room looked out onto the main street (which I wanted)

The rooms are basic and yes in many ways need to be updated. My room had a co-joined doors -   to the next room  - one on my side one on their side but there was no noise or disturbance.

The bathroom was a good size but the sink was slow to empty. Bath was great and the shower was one of the best power showers I've ever experienced in a hotel. I opted to buy my own products as I find hotel products can be very drying.

I also bought some black towels & pillow cases - (There is a wonderful Primark 5 minute walk from the hotel) I have red dyed hair and i hate destroying white towels & pillowcases!

In the room itself:
The bed is comfortable and I loved the pillows & yes it's 2 single beds pushed together but that's a standard practice in Europe. As an tea drinking Irish gal, I was disappointed that there was no tea/coffee facilities in the room, no kettle or mugs. So I had to pay a €20 deposit (which I got back after checking out)  for a kettle.

If a person is ""particular"" about decor, then the paint lifting off the walls around the skirting board would annoy you - it didn't bother me but I do feel things like that should be tidied up right - not a patch up job, and there are a few patch up jobs about the place.

This bit is VERY important to note. From my room 109 1st floor, the metro runs under the hotel and it is very loud - I had read that somewhere so brought earplugs with me incase my room was near the ground floor (i didn't know at the time if I would be on the 4th floor or 1st floor)  And further to that - when it runs under the hotel (every 10 minutes or so) items rattle in the room. During the day it's a little less noticeable because of street noise - but then again you're not in your room during the day!
So be aware of that.

Other slight disappointments was the lack of atmosphere - i didn't see a bar anywhere and it would have been nice to sit in the lobby area and read/ chill. Nothing is sign posted so it feels a little ""empty""

Major disappointment was the breakfast. It is not at all as described on the website. Hot plate options: Bacon & a bowl of scrambled egg which really didn't look good. A cold plate option: Cheese, ham, cold cut meats & yogurt. 2 types of cereals, apples and oranges and juices. 2 coffee machines, bread for toast, some pastries. Really poor options for a 5 night stay. it was underwhelming.

The breakfast is light and airy and such a lovely area but they close it after breakfast so no one has access to sit in the space and have a coffee which is a little disappointing.

There is a menu for room service - but Barcelona has so many options for food, a short walk down any back street and you'll find some amazing treats.

My suggestions for the hotel would be:
When people check in perhaps point out the  areas in the hotel to get a drink/ coffee be it a bar of table service so people know they can get something there.

Boiled eggs and bananas would be a good addition to breakfast at the very least.

Perhaps take a little time to re-paint and fix up the rooms. 

Provide earplugs for rooms that the metro is most loud in and street facing rooms. 

The hotel is a super location without doubt but a good nights sleep is important as well to enjoy to city rested.",3,2022,03,25
60,BCN,"Pleasant staff, nice place where to stay, we enjoy time in the city and at the hotel as well, next time I will prefare to come again, location inside city superb, close to the city center, close to harbor",5,2022,03,11
60,Excellent quality/price report & fabulous location,"I'm very happy of my overall stay at Oriente Atiram, fabulous location in LAs ramblas next to major attractions and public transportation. I was also nicely received with people at hotel, they are very kind and helpful.",4,2022,02,03
60,Fab location on Las Ramblas,"We stayed for 3 nights as a couple. The location is great, less then a 10 minute stroll to the main bus stop for the airport buses & tour bus stop, plus over the road you have a McDonald's, KFC, souvenir shops & a supermarket a few minutes away.
The hotel is on Las Ramblas which means it is a very busy street, we were on the 4th floor & the street hustle & bustle could still be heard but it didn't interfere with sleep.
Staff were helpful, the hotel was clean & spacious. 
Breakfast was a simple affair, tea, coffee, juice, cornflakes, scrambled egg, bacon, pastries,toast, hams, but little else.
The beds were comfortable & the pillows were perfect. The TV is only Spanish channels.
We would stay again & would highly recommend the location.

Only real downside was the metro under the hotel as its frequent & you hear & feel it pass!",4,2022,01,19
60,Not worth what we paid,"It looks like the majority of the money just goes towards the fancy lobby but other than that, the hotel is very old and outdated. The bathroom is very uncomfortable and the beds are separate beds (even though we had requested a full bed).  I would like to reiterate I am a very tiny girl and I could barely maneuver inside the shower. The location is nice for a first time visit, as it's in the middle of all the action but the service and facilities are nothing crazy for *what we paid for*. Also it was very hot and the A/C system was centralized so it just heated up the room more. Wouldn't book again.",3,2022,01,07
60,Rooms Dated. Would not choose or recommend. ,"A Very Dated Hotel, definitely needs a refurb. Room size ok & no noise from the street outside (a plus in the busy city).The Bath and shower..!! paint peeling from inside the  bath,shower so clogged up with scale and took about 15mins of running the water to get any hot from it! Hairdryer worked and then wouldn't switch off. The answer after speaking to the reception was to take the key card out to turn the electric off! No maintenance to look at it for 4 hours!! Finially fixed by the receptionist, she hit it to stop it!! Breakfast was limited and using the Covid situation as an excuse for the minimum of items is a poor one. Three mornings I asked for poached eggs Or any other eggs other than the dried up rubbery scrambled eggs on offer,with an excuse everyday as to why I couldn't have them?? What could be more simple than cooking eggs of any other sort other than what was under the hot lights for ages. Hot buffet only consisted of the scrambled egg( if you can call it that) and bacon. Very Poor. 
Our room was on the first floor. As I said no noise from the street but there was a terriable vibrating across the floor.( it wasn't the subway as it was continuous.) It wasnt there when we first arrived & then started. Got worse as the time went on.We asked the receptionist to come and look, listen & feel because they didn't believe us. She had to agree & even she didn't know where it was coming from? You could feel it in all the beds and across the floor?? 
Kindly she moved us. But it was a hassle during our limited holiday. Room 2, was a nicer room but noisy, cold & smelly! 
Would not recommend to stay here. Look elsewhere.
Loved Barcelona but would choose a different hotel.",2,2021,12,30
60,Lovely,"Lovely ,extremely clean hotel . Perfect location for our short stay in Barcelona.

Would definitely stay there again .",5,2021,12,26
60,An excellent Hotel,"a superb hotel exceptionally clean arrived Monday and was allowed an early check in by fantastic staff. Stayed for 3 days the room was cleaned every day and was left immaculate. Reception staff were kind enough to print off my paperwork to ensble me to travel home ( plf form ) . A superb location and would happily stay again. The Lady on reception from Lithuania ( i didnt get her name )  was exceptional .

All in all a fantastic hotel in lovely city .
i will definitely be back

60,horrible stay,"The room was small, the bedsheets weren't really covered correctly (just two plankets, one each side... talking about clean during corona...). Room was freaking cold, no way of turing the AC off. And worst nightmare, the ventilation in the bathroom ran all the time so no way of getting a quit sleep @ night without earplugs...",1,2021,12,12

Staff in reception very helpful and nice, especially Ieva. She helped us with advices how to get into places, recommended places where to eat. Highly recommend!",5,2021,11,24
60,A big let down.,"We were so let down on our recent trip to Oriente Atiram Hotel in Barcelona. I had selected this hotel as a special surprise but it was a nightmare. There was a dreadful smell from the bathroom drains, a very big leak in the hallway, which maintenance began taking down walls to fix and banging through the night, which kept us awake. The staff were really unhelpful and I have emailed several times with no response.",1,2021,11,18
60,Wonderful holiday in Barcelona,"I go to Barcelona for work but this time I came with my family. Excellent hospitality of the Oriente Hotel, we had already been a few years ago, the excellent hospitality is confirmed. The welcome drink and the excellent breakfasts were greatly appreciated. Perfect location for visiting the city on foot.",5,2021,11,18
60,Great hotel & location,"The hotel was lovely but needs updating. The beds were very comfortable and the pillows but no frills. Great view onto the Rambla, no fridge in room a must in warm weather. There was a kettle but no cups or a spoon or any tea, coffee or sugar, so why a kettle? There wasn’t a chair so we had to ask for one.
The bathroom had toiletries and a hairdryer but many of the tiles were cracked and broken.",4,2021,11,08
60,perfect location and marvellous buidling,"Marvelous historical building, directly on the rambla, 2 minutes walking from the metro station, the room for four was very comfortable and spacious. The people at the reception were always very helpful. Strongly recommneded",5,2021,11,08
60,Noisy,"Stayed in room 403. It was very noisy from the street beacuse the windowds are so bad, and the subwayline is directly under the hotel. It acctualy shakes all the way up into the hotel... every fifth minute.
A big plus is the location... can´t find a better one if you like to stay in the central parts of Barcelona.
Breakfast was ok, standard ok, staff ok but all in all, i would not stay here again because of the street noise.",2,2021,11,05
60,Perfectly priced - perfectly located,"Excellent value for money! Located in the middle of The Ramblas, you have immediate access to the vast Metro network.

the 2 star i gave is because of the staff and the breakfast area  which is nice and clean the staff is very helpful and kind..breakfast  quality very good.
the hotel needs to renevate yesterday....",2,2021,10,27
60,Fantastic Location,"Being in the middle of La Rambla, this hotel puts you in the best location in Barcelona. Many outstanding restaurants, Plaza Ctalunya and Columbus Circle are at your fingertips.  Old Town is across the street. The hotel is clean with a beautiful lobby and great service. They could update the mattresses, but don't let this stop you from booking this hotel.",4,2021,10,23
60,Nice hotel in Las ramblas,"The hotel is very good situated right at Las Ramblas. The decor is cute. The rooms are clean and pretty. We had a balcony giving to Las Ramlas, but we did not hear any noise at night.
The staff were kind and available.
I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2021,10,20
60,Excellent choice!,"The room was clean and spacious, the view was nice, and the hotel staff was so, so nice to us!
Even though we did not choose a room with a view of Las Ramlas, we had a room that was situated on the corner of the building, so we still could admire a little bit of it. :) And we had a balcony, which we did not expect. :) The AC was working on cold air, but also on hot air, which was a big plus. 
We had a little problem with the TV and the staff was so helpful and managed to resolve it so quickly.
The hotel is also close to most of the tourist objectives and the beach (~20-30 minutes by foot, but it's totally worth it).

I would totally recommend Oriente Atiram Hotel.",5,2021,10,09
60,"Beautiful hotel, rooms absolutely in need of renovation","Pros: 
- The location is really great: within a 2 minutes walk of La Boqueria market, Plaça Reial and Liceu metro station and a 10 minutes walk of Plaça Catalunya and Barrio Gothic. 
- Amazing lobby: as soon as you enter you realize you are in a historic building and the first impression is really good. 
- The reception is open 24 hours a day and the receptionists are very friendly.
- Breakfast is varied and plentiful.

Cons: 
- Unfortunately, the rooms we saw did not look anything like the photos of the rooms (with modern design and colors) that appear on Booking, Tripadvisor and the hotel website. Our room – see photo –had a very outdated and damaged sofa bed. 
-  The bed mattress was very thin (you could feel the bed frame under the mattress). 
- There is no fridge nor the jug to heat water in the room.
- I find it absurd and unhygienic that all guests must use the same tongs to serve themselves at the breakfast counter, given the COVID situation.
- The soundproofing is ridiculous: you can distinctly hear the voices of the neighbors, and the noise of the street is not minimally attenuated by the windows. We woke up several times during the night, and if you are a light sleeper the hotel is absolutely to be avoided.
 
Last thing: we traveled along with another family, asking for a quad room each. Our room had a queen size bed and a sofa bed, while the other family's room had four single king size beds, paired two by two, so their comfort was much better than ours, but the price of the two rooms was exactly the same. 

Bottom line: Aesthetically it is a great hotel, but the rooms could really use some renovation, especially in terms of soundproofing. I honestly doubt I would stay there again. It is a pity because the hotel is very beautiful and the staff is very kind.",2,2021,10,07
60,Uitstekend,"Beautiful hotel, nice personal and clean rooms.

60,"Loud, uncomfortable and very hot","Disliked  · First of all I had requested a quiet room, the room was far from quiet. The walls were like paper and the two rooms beside us were very loud which made it hard to get asleep. The shower was awful, it fell down mid shower onto my boyfriends shoulder and left him with a mark and in a lot of pain. The shower also flooded the whole bathroom every time we used it as there was no door to the shower. The beds may aswell have been two single beds as they were constantly separating and they did not have a double duvet, each bed had its own duvet. The air conditioning was awful, the room was so hot.. almost unbearable even though we had the air con up the full way. The phone in the room also did not work it required a pin that was no where to be found which made it difficult to ring reception. The staff were not very friendly… on the hotels website it states that there is an outdoor terrace however when my boyfriend asked where the terrace was the man at the desk was very rude and shouted at him that there was no terrace. The cleaners in the morning were also very loud and came into our rooms while we sleeping. I was very let down with out stay as the website makes the hotel look much better than it is.",1,2021,06,27
60,Disappointed in service related end result,"It's not possible for fair review of service as no service was rendered. Booked rooms for a travel group, COVID cancelled the flight, cancelled the cruise and the hotel was not open, and yet we were refused refunds ... as I secured the deposit personally for over 800 euros with MY personal credit card. It's 5 months later and still no resolution or refund.",1,2020,09,19
60,Our Home in Barcelona,"This is the place to stay in Barcelona and we will be back!! This is a hotel that welcomes you as if you were visiting your family. Julio and Fernán at the Front Desk and Araceli at the Bar made us feel truly at home. The lobby is so beautiful and our room was super comfortable. They are located right on La Rambla so the location is fantastic. This hotel has been owned and managed by the same family for many years... this is why it is like being at someone’s home and not just like a place where you rent a room.  
We had a room for 3 (double bed and a single bed for my 14th year old son) that was very comfortable. We were facing la Ranbla, which was fun at night - even though there is a less tourism now; it was nice to see how locals and some tourists like us are beginning to appreciate all what life has to offer...
Thank you Oriente Atiram for opening up. This Covid-19 has not taking the best of us and it has not taking the best of you either.

We highly recommend this hotel!!!!",5,2020,07,22
60,Perfect place ,"Chose this hotel originally as was reasonably priced for the location and of 3* standard. Was very happy with our stay here and would 100% return when I next visit Barcelona! It’s right in the middle of la rambla and across the road from Plaça reial so in terms of location you can’t go wrong. The rooms were adequate size and of a good standard, more modern than some hotels in Barcelona. Very clean and comfortable. Safe was in the room and free of charge along with a fridge also. Staff were very friendly and helpful especially Ramon. This trip was a birthday surprise for my mum who absolutely loved it and was a lovely touch from the hotel to leave a little cake in the room on the day we were celebrating. I can be quite picky with hotels but I was not disappointed at all with this and can’t wait to come back again. ",5,2020,03,16
60,Best nights sleep ,"Just returned back from a 3 night stay at this fabulous hotel. A surprise for my birthday from my amazing daughter. Location perfect. The hotel is very clean and had really helpful friendly staff, Ramon on reception was excellent , helpful & so friendly. A massive shout out for the beds WoW so comfy & the pillows are latex so that was a massive plus, had the best sleep. Didn’t eat at the hotel as we up & our each morning. The Irish bar just across the road Flaherty's Irish Pub great breakfast. I would definitely recommend this hotel as it was in the best location & it was so clean & had comfy beds ",5,2020,03,13
60,Great Location,"We have just returned from a 4 night break at the Oriente Atrium Hotel  on a bed & breakfast basis. The hotel is in a great location about two thirds of the way down Las Rambler right in the thick of it!! 
The hotel itself is lovely & clean, reception staff very good, rooms are basic but clean with adequate facilities and a comfy bed, but it does not have a bar which was a bit of a let-down but there are plenty of hostelries very close to hand. 
The breakfast was good with a ready supply of coffee, fruit juices and a cold buffet but the 'hot food' was not and in truth a waste of time!! a very good stay overall just a shame about the bar & hot breakfast.",4,2020,03,13
60,Relaxing break great location,We stayed in the oriente for 4 nights.stunning when walking in to the lobby like a 1920's film set a bit of building work off to the right would like to see what it looks like when finished. Staff very nice and professional rooms cleaned every day. Only thing was furnishing in room were dated but the location more than makes up for this. Great place great staff would go back tomorrow,5,2020,03,06
60,A nice clean hotel in the middle of renovations,"This is an older classic style hotel that is under going renovations.  The renovations done so far are coming along very well, this will be an attractive hotel once completed.  The room was clean and comfortable but the sound proofing to the hallway outside the room was not as good as most hotels I've stayed at.  Breakfast was quite good.  Definitely would stay again if in Barcelona.",4,2020,03,03
60,Overall a good choice,"Our stay in the hotel was overall fine. the rooms are basic and clean.
The hotel is located 2 minutes away from Liceu metro station which was super helpful and i think it is what mostly gives the hotel an advantage.",4,2020,03,03
60,Good location but disappointing hotel ,"Positives
Good location on Las Ramblas
Big and clean room with a good clean shower

Negatives
Currently under renovation so reception is very tatty 
Room was very basic. Wardrobe doors used as door to the bathroom. It was some sort of internal room but they had installed windows which didn't open and which had no natural light. Room was very dark. No carpet. No air conditioning so room was too hot.  Tried to move but was told no rooms as hotel full. 
Wouldn't stay again. ",3,2020,03,03
60,Hotel located in the heart of the city,This hotel is located just a few minutes walk from Liceu metro station on La Rambla. So you are in the heart of the city with easy access to all the attractions and places of entertainment. The hotel lobby looked like something out of a Hercule Poirot movie. Our room was comfortable and the breakfast (12Euro) great value for money. My only minor gripe was the lack of a kettle and complimentary tea/coffee that we take for granted in the UK. I would recommend this hotel. The hotel also left a cake in our room for one of the family who celebrated their birthday. Thats the sign of a good customer oriented hotel in my books.,4,2020,02,25
60,Beautiful hotel - excellent location,"A beautiful hotel in a great location. We travelled as a family and had 2 bedrooms in Floor 3. 1 room was much bigger than the other, but both spotlessly clean, comfortable with everything we needed for our stay.  Las Ramblas rooms, overlooked La Rambla with a balcony. I would expect street noise may be an issue in busier months, but we aall slept well with no disturbance.  Staff were very friendly and helpful recommending local restaurants where we had excellent meals.  Could not fault hotel or staff and will definitely return if we re-visit Barcelona.",4,2020,02,21
60,Good location for a 1970s hotel,"Great location but very low standard of hotel. Woodchip wallpaper, wooden floors that move as your walking on them. Old antique style furniture and nothing matches. 2* at best. Also 3 adults in a really small room. No tea making facilities. 
Would not recommend. It’s like a 1970s hotel. 

Staff were pleased tho",2,2020,02,21
60,"Excellent location, very clean.","I stayed here for 5 nights in December on a short vacation. The location for a tourist can not be beat. A very short walk to the metro and the famous Boqueria market. Many restaurants and bars nearby. 
My room was one of the ones that overlooked the ramblas on the second floor. The view was great and people watching is fun when you're winding down for the day. Room and bathroom spotless and the bed was comfortable There was some street noise at night as is mentioned in other reviews, but it was not enough to keep me awake, and I'm a pretty light sleeper. If noise is a huge concern, maybe book a room on a higher floor. 
What this is not is a luxury hotel. Older building, some parts are renovated, some are not. But the service was nice, room was comfy and I felt safe and secure as a woman traveling alone. Price is great. 
Would definitely stay again.",5,2019,12,24
60,Lovely hotel disappointing room,"Booked here for the location and was excited as it was my 50th birthday...I foolishly booked a basic room as we wasn't expecting to stay in it too much however a kettle and a half decent view would have been nice as soon as I saw the brick wall out of my window I went to reception to ask to be moved only to be told by a very curt receptionist I would have to pay €15 pppn I only asked for a different view not a balcony on the street, she refused!...not a great start to the celebration however the location was perfect and I would book again just for that.

On the second day of 4 I reported that I'd caught my top on one of 4 nails sticking out the wardrobe door..no apology and the nails were still there when we left.

My partner paid €2.50 for a bottle of water from the vending machine which never came out so reception (again no apology) handed him a small bottle.

On a plus ...On my birthday I was given a little note wishing me happy birthday and bottle of water (yippee obviously I gave it to my partner), a Barcelona shopping bag and a little bag of jelly babies so I'm most grateful for that.

Overall this hotel is beautifully old but worn and the staff don't particularly care about it's upkeep and customers who don't pay top notch however beautiful Barcelona made up for the disappointing hotel 🤔",2,2019,12,11
60,IDEAL FOR A SHORT BREAK,"We stayed here at the end of November for three nights. Perfect location for being in the heart of all the action. A Metro stop is right outside and it is only a short walk to main square, shops, marina and Gothic area. 
The hotel had some work in progress but nothing to disturb us. The room was basic but clean. I wasn't bothered about not having a good view(we backed onto the Police station backyard), we weren't staying there to look out of the windows. It had a free safe, tv ( tv didn't work, but again, we didn't go to Barcelona to watch tv).
The staff were all polite and helpful. All in all we would definitely stay here again when we next visit.
I did read some of the negative reviews but after our experience, I couldn't relate to many of the gripes being shared. Just right for a short break.
",5,2019,12,07
60,Average experience,"The hotel is located very centrally and is generally a very basic hotel. I've noticed works being done to renovate it and I guess after that, it will be upgraded. At the time I stayed, the rooms were small and needed renovation. Staff not helpful and (I guess due to the works) a terrible smell was present in all parts of the hotel. Breakfast was decent.",3,2019,11,22
60,Small Hotel,Hotel was of good quality & clean. Reception staff pleasant  and helpful. The hotel is in the university area and lots of students around. No shortage of restaurants and bars. Room a little small. Facilities limited in hotel. Ideal as a base for one or two nights.,3,2019,11,06
60,Brilliant Brilliant  location and really friendly staff,"couldn't be better placed. we were in a side room, so no view but quite nice for sleeping. Hotel room was basic but large and very clean - our kids (20/18yr olds)  room had a fridge which was helpful. clean and friendly with comfy beds. didn't eat here but heard folk say it was very nice. Would DEFO stay here aga if i was ever going back to Barcelona ",5,2019,11,03
60,Very Basic Hotel in a good area ,"Atiram Oriente Hotel 45 Ramblas Barcelona is a very basic hotel. We visited October 30 to November 1.
Very good staff. However the rooms were dated.  It was hot and we were told that AC was off Heat was on so we had no choice so we opened the window and they provided a fan.  The shower did not work(hand held) sprayed all over the place. There were no outlets to charge phones etc. we had to unplug TV to charge phones.  Location is great but sleeping with open windows was very very loud. ",4,2019,11,02
60,Room is hotter than the surface of the sun!,"I’ll start with the positives which won’t take long, the location and the lollipops on reception. 
Now for the negatives for starters I’m typing this at 4.08am as I’m wide awake yet again as our room overlooks a side street where the local youths seem to hang out. They make so much noise it’s untrue (even with the windows shut). Been down to speak to reception and they are not interested.
Secondly the room is quite literally the hottest place I have ever stayed and it’s just miserable trying to get sleep, get ready or do anything at all, opening doors at night is not an option because of the noise. 
We are in a family room but it is so cramped we can hardly move (which also adds to the heat in the room). The photos on the website are a joke, our room looked nothing like that, very dated and in need of repair. 
The room lacks even the most basic of things you would expect in a hotel, no where at all to sit, no fridge, a mirror at a reasonable height, the list could go on. 
Generally I think that whoever took the photographs for the website did a really good job, this hotel is very run down and a massive disappointment. I’d think very carefully before booking this place.",1,2019,10,31
60,Great hotel,"We stay in this hotel from 09/29-10/05, very clean room, very comfortable beds and great location. Frontdesk very friendly and helpful, Highly recommended , we was not had breakfast in hotel but around so many restaurants, when we will decide visit again we will be stay again in same hotel for sure.",5,2019,10,25
60,Great Location,"Lovely  clean hotel  in a great location on the main Ramblas 
Reception  staff are helpful and cannot do enough for you
Breakfast was lovely 
Clean room comfy bed shower was on point 
Would defo visit again",5,2019,10,18
60,Great for a girl's trip,"We had a great 3 night stay here booked as a package through Jet2. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful with any queries. We didn't have breakfast so can't comment on that but the location was perfect. We had a third floor triple room which was on the side street so we could see onto La Rambla but it wasn't too noisy. As others reviewers have commented, you can hear/feel the Metro but it's a city centre hotel so it's to be expected and doesn't detract at all from the comfort of the room. The room was clean and plenty big enough, with fresh towels. The air con was useful as although it was almost middle of October it was warm at night. Great base for exploring with Liceu metro just a minute away. Would definitely recommend and use again if coming back.",4,2019,10,16
60,not as good as last year,We are staying here at the moment. Have been 4 times before to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Always had a good time. Good breakfast very comfy beds especially the pillows. The hotel is clean and central to Las Ramblas. This time we upgraded our room to a deluxe. My advice is don't bother save your money. We had a fridge in our room and tea and coffee making facilities. Only here 4 nights but on day 2 we ran out of milk and asked reception for some more . We were told to go to the shop around the corner to buy our own. !!! Not acceptable we have paid a lot more money for these facilities. Also the tv had no English channels so we were unable to catch up with the news at home.  When we queried this with reception staff as we had English channels last yr we were told that the hotel had no need for any English channels !! We deemed this comment to be a little racist and complained to the manager who did apologise. Furthest to say we are a little disappointed in the hotel this year and probably will not be returning due to the lack of customer service,3,2019,10,12
60,Awesome location,"Just checked out this morning.  A few days ago booked two rooms.  One for myself, one for my mother and grandmother.

The good:  checkin was fairly quick, multilingual.  The place looks like someone’s refurbished grand home from 1800, but in a nice way.  The location is excellent!  Plenty of cafes about, a short hop to the Columbus monument where all the Hop On / Hop Off tours go by.  Easy access, plenty to see and do at what was a good price.
 
The neutral:  grandma uses a walker.  There are ramps down to the two elevators, just a little steep.  With the way the rooms are laid out, there are still stairs on each floor - and some rooms have stairs into the room.  She could really only use the one elevator (unless she wanted to then take the ramp on that floor.). Depending on the room, some noise from outside - especially on a weekend night.  The beds were a little firm for our tastes.

The bad:  breakfast.  Sorry, not sorry.  I’m used to hot food, not cold and sitting out under a heat lamp.  Bacon may be continentally cooked but otherwise seems rare as heck and fatty.  

Overall, it was a good stay, worth it but not great.",4,2019,10,12
60,City break ,"We spent 4 nights at the hotel. We found it to be spotlessly clean an functional. Our room, on the first floor, overlooked las Ramblas. Yes there was street noise, and you could hear the rumble of the metro trains, but it all added to the hustle and bustle of a vibrant city. The hotel location was perfect, Liceu metro station only a couple of minutes walk away. The breakfast was adequate. Chicken sausages, scrambled eggs, beans and bacon. There were continental style options there too. 

Me?, I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel. Staff were helpful and courteous, rooms spotless. Loved it. ",5,2019,10,11
60,the best location,"this hotel has a really great location , I went to Barcelona with 40 female students and it was really so good for them and for me because shopping is there all kind of restaurants .. in one word everything you may need , and I am going again in January ",4,2019,10,09
60,10 days in Barcelona,"We stayed from 16-26 Sept (and luckily during the Le Merce festival)!

In arriving at the hotel, our greeting by the reception staff was excellent and our room overlooking La Rambla was great! The location was superb for all activities in Barcelona and many of the festival processions went past our window! It is a very lively street but the noise was not to bad (other than the metro which you can hear and feel)!

Breakfast is good with a usual selection of hot and cold food!

We had an issue with the extractor fan in the bathroom, advised the reception staff and it was fixed by the time we returned to the room that afternoon.

All staff were friendly, helpful and efficient!

I would certainly use Oriente Atiram again if I went to Barcelona!",5,2019,10,03
60,NOT IMPRESSED,"Reception slow and no-one to take our bags. Staff unfriendly and disinterested. 
Reception surrounding depressingly grey and tired looking furniture. No Bar - no effort made.
I left a belonging behind on arrival at home and no-one has bothered to contact myself.
The room was depressing although clean.",2,2019,10,02
60,Drip Drip Drip,"I’m writing this review at 2:46 am while I’m at the Oriente Atiram hotel. While the location is perfect, there are more than a dozen other hotels that you should definitely consider and reconsider before you choose this one. Our room has a leak from the ceiling that has been “fixed” twice and yet here we are with another night of interrupted sleep from the sound of water dripping from the ceiling. It’s not just our room, on our several complaints at the front desk, other guests have been there with the same issue. They know that this is a major problem, they just don’t care. They refused to put us in another room while continuing to check others in. At this point I’ll just let my credit card company handle it when I dispute the charges. We are on our 3rd and final night, thank goodness!!!

Also, on the evening of day 2 we asked for 2 bottles of water because the water in our room had not been restocked. They told us there was a store around the corner. It was 11pm. We repeated our issue and the front desk guy snatched the key down and went on to retrieve 2 bottles of water for us. Perhaps we should’ve just placed our empty bottles under the leak in the ceiling for a refill 🙄. 

I RARELY take the time to write reviews, but I felt the need to warn everyone about this hotel.",1,2019,09,30
60,Brilliant Location,"The hotel is classic Barcelona, a fine slightly faded old building. It is located 15 to 20 minutes walk down the pedestrianised Ramblas from the Plaça de Catalunya airport bus stop.
We booked for two nights and reception was friendly and efficient. Interior access is step free and there are two lifts. Our 3rd floor room was clean and comfortable with tea and coffee making facilities and air conditioning. We had booked room only, but as a gesture to compensate for recurring problems with the safe in our room, we were offered a complementary breakfast, which was very good.
We have visited Barcelona several times and stayed in good hotels, but this has to be the best located of them. Our room had a small balcony offering a great view over the Ramblas. The double glazing was quite effective and, despite revelry going on outside through the night (it was La Mercè Festival), we slept well.
Step outside and you are in the heart of the eating and entertainment area. For the best value food and drink, cross the road to the side streets around Plaça Reial or Carrer Ferran. Some of the pavement cafés in the Ramblas can be expensive.
Hotel checkout time is 12 noon, but a secure storage system operates to allow you to leave your luggage until later in the day.
All in all, an ideal place to stay for a Barcelona city break.",5,2019,09,30
60,City break,"Stayed here for 3 nights, real old city centre building. Bang in the middle of La Rambles. Friendly staff, nice rooms, great breakfast choices. I'm on a gf diet, so all I had to miss out was the bread and pastries. ",5,2019,09,27
60,La Terazza Restaurante - rip off!,Stopped for a drink at this hotels bar/restaurant in front of the hotel on la rambla. Ordered a mojito and it was massive and cost €25!! Two drinks cost €50!! No drinks menu in sight they just rush you and ask what you want to drink.  SCAM. AVOID,1,2019,09,23
60,Nice Hotel,"Really enjoyed our time here, firstly reception staff were amazing so friendly and helpful nothing was a problem, and they pointed us into the direction of the best dinner we had in Barcelona (Louro), the room was nice clean and my girlfriend absolutely loved the giant pillows. The location is perfect  so easy to access anything you want, the only little thing that got annoying was the cleaners taking our 2nd room key and having to get a new one each day. Will stay here again if we ever visit Barcelona again ",4,2019,09,21
60,Unfortunate mishap marred an incredible stay,"I am sorry that this review is not a rave. There was so much to love about this hotel, but in one way they failed.

So let's get the failure out of the way first. On my final day, I was showering in the morning. Someone thought it was stylish to make the shower enclosure half-glass and no door, so it's not possible to shower without the floor getting wet. When I stepped out onto the terrycloth bath mat, it slipped--my knee bent inward--and I went down hard. I'm happy to say that, after I gathered myself and got to my feet and put weight on it, I found I wasn't seriously injured--I was afraid my remaining European trip was lost for a flight back to the states for another knee surgery. In the end, I was able to do everything planned, with a few changes (the hop-on, hop-off bus tour was enjoyed from the lower level, and hopping off was agonizing so I didn't do as much as I may have).

I have informed the management about the issue--I hope they will install doors on all the showers or provide non-slip mats for the floor so that future guests aren't at risk.

Now, having said that--I think I want to stay here again.

The room was nice and comfy with plenty of space for our electronic devices to charge. The building dates back to the 17th century and they're renovating it faithfully--our room faced the inner courtyard and the detail work around the windows was classic. They also have a section from the 16th century, a former convent, that they're renovating to the same standards--one of the management gave us a tour of the area, and it will be stunning.

They offer a breakfast buffet for 12 Euros, and by all means buy it--it was the best! Now yes, the coffee comes from the Nespresso machine (perhaps the staff will show you how they customize their brew?). But the warm selections are honestly warm: real (not bagged) eggs,  beans, sausages, and that ham-style Spanish bacon--there's also a cold table where you can get the lunch meats and cheeses that Spaniards like for breakfast, plus some of the best melon I'd had all summer--also lots of breaeds, sausages (including blood sausage--love it but a little strong for breakfast), also great pastries.

The location is superb, right on Las Ramblas, the livelist night spot in Barcelona, where you may find limitless restaurant and shopping options. The docks of Barcelona are within walking distance, and right around the corner is a Gaudi house that, I think, you should prefer to visit--shorter lines and less crowds than Sagrada Familia.

So this is a complicated review, but I'm hoping it does some good.",4,2019,09,20
60,No AC. Incorrect room description.,"I booked the room and was excited about the location.  I have been to Barcelona before and was excited to show my friends around. Upon arrival they allowed us to place our rooms in a closet which was nice since our rooms were not available yet.  We left and came back to find that our rooms were not as described on the website.  I did not care much because they were at least clean.

Attempt 1: We left and returned late at night to find an extremely hot room.  We thought because the key had not been in the card reader it needed some time.  It did not improve at all and we told the receptionist.  They said they would have someone look at it that same day.  We left for the day and returned and no one told us whether someone had been in our room or not and it was still hot.

Attempt 2: At this time I asked someone that worked in the hotel cleaning service to come in to see if I was doing something incorrectly and she said I needed to complain because our room was extremely hot.  I went back downstairs and they said someone had already fixed it but that they would fixed it again. I happened to be in the room when they came in and the person who fixed the room said that although it reads that the AC is cold, there is not cold air coming out.  He asked to go to the hallway because our room was hot. 

Attempt 3: I went downstairs and told them it was hot and they said that the tech said the AC read it was cold.  I told them that the tech himself told us it reads cold but it is hot.  They told us there was nothing they could do but give us a fan.

Attempt 4: They gave us a fan but the room is still hot and if we have the fan on and the blow dryer on at the same time it sets off the fuse.  The receptionist had to come reset it and luckily it stayed open so every time it happened we would reset it ourselves.

Attempt 5: They finally told us they could give us a new room but we had to pack all of our things, they would store them, and then we would need to unpack in another room.  We explained to them that we were leaving the following day and asked if there was something else they could do.  They offered us breakfast but we told them that we were leaving before breakfast was served and told us we could speak to a manager. The manager was extremely apologetic and nice, and he told us that it was a big hotel (it is not) and he has to cool all of the rooms (but why would his staff tell me to complain about the heat). He offered us an extra night and I told him I was leaving and wanted that money returned.  He said it was not possible because he had to talk to a lot of people and that he wished he had known about this the first night (which his staff was aware of). He asked us to NOT post a bad review because then it would take a long time to figure out a means to resolve the problem and that he would touch base with us to see how else he could make up for the horrible experience instead.  

It is a month later and I have not heard from them.  Pay attention to other reviews that also state the rooms are not as described. Every time I went to the reception there was someone who was mad about their rooms looking different than the website.  It is all a game of chance and you may end up with a bad room whether you go in early or late because it all depends on what is available.",1,2019,09,07
60,Bait and Switch,"We are currently at the Oriente Atiram. We checked in yesterday through a promotion between American Airlines and Booking.com. 

The room we received looked NOTHING like the images posted on the website and photos (see below). We talked to a hotel employee and they said that they could move us to the room we saw in the photos today. We had to bring our luggage down and check it by noon. 

We did as instructed and was told we didn’t come early enough and no room was available. Meaning they could ONLY put us in the same type of room. 

We called Booking.com and they stated they tried to reach the hotel 3x and no one answered. They were calling the hotel when I was on the line with them and saw two employees present at the front desk. 

This hotel is a sham. We were put in a room with dirty and torn lamp fixtures, old furniture and broken bathroom door. 

The customer service is poor and we could not speak with the manager. I would not recommend. 

I suppose if you get the “good” Modern rooms you will be fine. But unfortunately for us we were stuck with paying for a nice room and got a dump. We have to wait until booking.com reaches the hotel before any kind of compensation is issued. Which is infuriating because I have dealt with other booking websites and they have been far more timely in their accommodations. ",1,2019,08,24
60,Beautiful hotel! ,"Absolutely beautiful hotel in the heart of Barcelona, La Rambla! Couldn’t have asked for nicer staff, willing to help at any time! Really enjoyed every second! 
Very clean and modern inside too! Bang in the middle of La Rambla which makes it easy to get to each place quickly!! ",5,2019,08,23
60,Ripped off..avoid at all cost.La Terraze which is the outside restaurant part of hotel Oriente on la rambla,"La Terrazze is in front of the hotel with a fairly averagely priced menu. We sat down and ordered food and the waiter asked us what we wanted to drink and listed the usual beer,sangria etc. Stupidly...we didnt ask for a drinks menu and ordered 2 beers, a fanta limon, still water and a cocktail. The beer was served on steins as was the fanta and the cocktail...not the standard size experienced in all the other restaurants we'd visited. The bottle of water was tiny..the food was fairly tasteless. Then for the bill..a group of Spanish people next to us actually started talking to us as they too felt they had been ripped off and felt there should be a forum to name and shame this type of behaviour. The beers were 15 euros each and the cocktail 25 euros, we paid 114 euros for lunch and they had the cheek to include a 10% tip for the service from unfriendly waiting staff. Spoiled our day, DO NOT GO IN HERE!",1,2019,08,21
60,11 NIGHT CITY BREAK,I stayed at hotel with my family. found the rooms to be sufficient and comfortable. We where at the front of the hotel with a view  of the rambles. We did not have a noise issue. The rooms were cleaned every day.All the staff were polite and helpful. The doors to all the rooms were noisy when closing and the corridors were tiled and seemed noisy. The breakfast was same every day and not very good ,4,2019,08,17
60,Great hotel,"We stayed here for 2 night with mum. Hotel very comfortable with great location. It is on Rambla in 1 minute walk from Liceau metro from where you can easily go to other places. Staff is very helpful, even they check in us 2 hours earlier. Rooms very clean, comfortable, the only minus is that there were no fridge. Breakfasts were very tasty",5,2019,08,11
60,Quad room with two teens!,"We enjoyed our three night stay at the Oriente.  We stayed in a quad room- two adults and two teens.  The room was comfortable.  I liked the set up- two twin beds right next to each other and two other twin beds with a nightstand in between. It was a bit noisy being on the first floor, room 121.  The first night was really loud because one side faces a busy youth hostel, the other side faces a staff workroom where employees arrive very early and chat in the workroom and of course there's noise being directly on La Rambla.  I asked to change rooms but was told that all quad rooms were full.  The second and third night weren't too bad.
Breakfast was amazing!  There was something for everyone- hot items such as eggs and bacon as well as cold cuts, yogurt, bread, pastries, cereal, juice as well as a huge Nutella dispenser.  We looked forward to breakfast every morning.
The best part about this hotel, however, is the location. You step out directly onto La Rambla and you are minutes away from incredible sightseeing.  I strongly recommend this hotel but bring your earplugs if you are staying on the lower floors.",4,2019,08,08
60,"Clean, handy location, welcoming place","I stayed in this hotel with my 2 daughters for 6 days. We felt very welcome by all the staff, everybody had a smile and was very accommodating of any request. I stayed in the 237 room, a triple room. Very clean, it was cleaned every morning. Our room had air conditioning, very refreshing after coming out from exploring the city in the hot weather. the beds are very comfortable and the room was very spacious. The location couldn't be better, right on Las Ramblas. Our room had a side view to the main road, with a little balcony. Although it is a busy and noisy street, that never bother us, we could not hear much inside the room. The hotel staff were very helpful with tips on best routes, transport. My only less positive point was regarding breakfast, although the offer was good and nice food, I found it way too expensive, £12 per person, but there's plenty of places to go and have breakfast for much less. We went to La Boqueria market, where there's a lot of choice. Other than that, was excellent, will definitely recommend and stay again.",4,2019,07,27
60,"Wonderful location, great hotel.","This hotel far exceeded expectations. We purchased it extremely last minute for a painful price. However, the hotel turned out to be very luxurious and comfortable. The AC worked wonderfully and the amenities were excellent. The staff was very helpful and bilingual. The best attribute of the hotel is its location. It is located right on Las Ramblas which is bustling both during the day and during the night time. I highly recommend visiting La Boquiera which is a very large market located near the hotel.",5,2019,07,24
60,Great stay! Perfect Location! Very helpful and friendly staff,"Great location - situated on the La Rambalas.  Easy access to public transport and fabulous restaurants in the Placa Reial.  Hotel is great, staff are very friendly and helpful.  We had a family room - 4 beds. Rooms are clean and comfortable and hotel had the best and biggest bath towel ever! Breakfasts were simple but perfect.
Would definitely stay there again",5,2019,07,11
60,Lovely hotel,"The hotel is located in the middle of le Rambles,  a very good situation. The hotel is clean the beds very comfortable. The staff are friendly and helpful. We didn't eat there but the dining room looks divine. I would definately return there and could recommend it to anyone to use as a Base for a delightful holiday ",4,2019,07,07
60,Good stay,"(+) the location is in the strategic and crowded Las Ramblas. It couldn't get any better as it is just 3 minutes away from Liceu Metro Station 
(+) restaurant is everywhere. Though their in room dining, sushi and Asian food actually look appetizing. Breakfast is cheap and enough (what more can you expect from European breakfast lol)
(+) room is pretty spacious. Pillow is nice though bed is not that comfy
(+) internet is blazing fast
(+) staff is efficient 

(-) toiletries is just basic

60,Great Location for a City Break,"I booked a family room - 3 adults sharing - and we each had a generous single bed. At the time of our stay, the room was not in modern decorative order as their brightly colored photos show (it was in fact quite dated, I imagine it’s not a priority-type room to redecorate) but it was extremely clean, comfortable and provided everything we needed for a short City Break, so we were quite happy. Besides, we barely spent any time in the room as we were out exploring!
The location is just perfect - right there on Las Ramblas - so you can easily walk to local attractions, galleries, museums, eateries and bars. You’re spoilt for choice.
If you want to go further, for example to visit La Sagrada Familiar then there’s a metro/underground station just a few steps from the hotel entrance. This is also perfect to get you to-and-from the airport with minimal line changes and at reasonable cost.
By the way, it is possible to walk to La Sagrada Familia from the hotel but I’d only recommend this to absolute walking enthusiasts beacause it’s a fair old stomp to say the least, particularly in the hotter months. But it gives you plenty of excuses to stop at cafes and bars enroute for a breather, which I did!!
The hotel breakfast was excellent, lots of variety in both hot and cold options.
Staff were all very helpful and their English was, thankfully, exceptional as I sadly only know a handful of ‘get-by’ words in Spanish.
I’d certainly stay here again - no doubt about it.",4,2019,06,19
60,Perfect location in Las Ramblas,"Booked the hotel Oriente Atiram  through EasyJet as a package for a weeks holiday. Room only basis deal. 
I had 2 special needs adults with me and we were made very welcome. 
Check in was very slow as it was busy at the time. 
We had a triple room which was a good size with a little balcony looking out to Las Ramblas.The room had everything required  full bathroom ,safe, TV, telephone,hairdryer,and free WIFI. 
The room was cleaned every day to a  high standard. With clean towels. The bedding was immaculate. The beds were comfortable. And we all enjoyed good nights sleeps. 
My only negative comment is I found the breakfast was expensive and not good value for money. Awful coffee  from a vending machine. And the suppose to be hot food was cold. Cheap cereals  and no  yogurts
So we only ate there the once lots of lovely places near by  to visit for lovely breakfasts. . 
This hotel has the perfect location stepping straight out onto the Las Ramblas. Short walk to the Gothic quarter, beach hop on hop of bus. And lots of near by restaurants. Our weeks stay was just perfect.",4,2019,06,19
60,City break to Barcelona ,"Great boutique hotel in the heart of Las Ramblas. Enjoyed my stay here with my wife, our room had a balcony which overlooked the busy Rambla.

The room was quite small but provided a decent bed and bathroom but not tea/coffee making facilities. 

Breakfasts were good value and offered hot and cold fare. Especially enjoyed the freshly made coffee. 

We found it a great base for our holiday, close to the excellent subway and local/tourist busses. 

I would recommend this hotel and would have no hesitation in booking if I ever returned to this beautiful city.",4,2019,06,15
60,Great service,"My wife and I stopped in today and were served by Maryanne. She was outstanding in every way. Beyond her service skills she was personable, friendly and had a superb fence of humor! She is the kind of person that you want to get to know better. What a fabulous representative for the establishment!",5,2019,05,27
60,terrific location,"So much to see and do within very short walking distance. Our room was perfectly fine; everything was spotless. Housekeeping did a terrific job every day. Since the hotel is on Ramblas, it is noisy, but since the room has a/c, we were able to close the window at night. Staff was helpful with any questions. It's a good value for its location.",4,2019,05,27
60,Great location but not much else ,"Sorry to have to write a poor review because the staff have been very pleasant. 

The hotel is in a great location right beside La Rambla. The room was very clean with crisp white sheets, fresh clean towels and a memory foam pillow. 

Sadly that is where the joy ends. 

Our room looked absolutely nothing like the one on the hotel website or or other photos on booking sites. They depicted smart modern decor with colourful accessories. 

We were treated to this delightful antique artefact, perhaps a nod to Gaudi in his experimental years. The rest of the furniture was in keeping with the headboard. 

Our biggest concern though was the noise. The walls were so thin we may just as well have been showering (and the rest) with the people in the room next door. 

The 8.30am knocking noise from someone building something above/below/next-door has now relented. Perhaps he’s gone for a coffee.

I’d have one too, if only there were facilities in the room. 

This room would be fine for a budget hotel but not at the price we paid. 

Clean, friendly and central but very tired. 

",2,2019,05,27
60,"Great hotel , great location , great staff!","The hotel is maybe a little tired, but very very clean, the room basic but bed very comfortable, clean towels , pillows etc every day , safe worked fine! The shower was amazing although the shower curtain was annoying! The staff all very helpful and polite, straight out of the doors to main street on las Ramblas , didn't have breakfast as was expensive , but plenty of nice places to eat right outside . Nothing bad to say at all. Would definitely return.",5,2019,05,18
60,Two Stars At Best But Great Location ,"We stayed for three nights in April and arrived at the hotel about 11:30. Our room wasn’t ready until after 14:30 so they stored our luggage for us and we went out sight seeing and for lunch.

Our room was 108 a city view room. Smaller than expected and very basic but functional. We expected a kettle and as there wasn’t one we asked at reception and one was quickly provided for a 20 euro deposit- the lady also brought cups and spoons 😀
The sound proofing wasn’t very good - the balcony doors didn’t close properly and as the underground metro passes close by we could feel a rumble every time a train went past
The room had a digital safe but the numbers had been scratched off the buttons - fortunately we’ve used that type of safe before so could work it out.
The location is fabulous- right in the middle of Las Ramblas - turn left or right and everything is within walking distance. 
We had booked bed and breakfast and checking in were told breakfast buffet was 7 to 11. The buffet was the usual hot selection of bacon (tasted Yuk) sausage eggs toast and cold cereal fruits sliced meats and cheese etc fruit juice if your lucky
The big disappointment was breakfast - if you had a table that had both salt and pepper you were one of the lucky few - and the buffet had so many empty parts - we sat down at 09:10 one morning to be told all the butter was gone so any toast would have to be dry !!
And if you want an egg you better be there when the hen is still laying it ! 

When we went walking the people in the street cafes had a breakfast that looked much better than ours 

Wouldn’t stay again due to the noise and the poor quality breakfast 
",2,2019,05,10
60,Great hotel on LaRamblas,Great location - comfortable and compact. Very good breakfast. Lots of bars and places to eat in a short walking distance from the hotel. Our room overlooked the walkway which was great but a little noisy. ,5,2019,05,07
60,Stolen money,I actually had a 3 night stay in this hotel a few weeks ago and couldn't fault any of it. However I returned last week with a group of friends for a one night stay. A safe is provided in the wardrobe but a sliding door to access it was jammed so I couldn't put my money in it.Seeing as I'd stayed a couple of weeks before I was confident to leave £200 in a coat in the wardrobe.When I came to pack the following day I discovered it had been stolen and I reported it to the hotel manager who I asked to review the cctv footage.As I was late for my flight she said she was going to email me and as of now she hasn't.Dont stay here the staff are thieves,1,2019,05,04
60,Terrible hotel and not serious etiher professional - chose another hotel,"We hade a reservation and received a confirmation of our stay. 
We were 5 persons from a company making our reservation several weeks prior to arrival and received a confirmation. Upon arrival the rooms were not available and hotel hade canceled our reservation without notifying us! They could not show any email as they said they had sent and changed their story many times.

This is not legal and according to other hotels they recomended a reclamation to be Done. Not surpringsingly this was either smothly from the hotel. 

Also The receptionist called  their manager and they had no intention to help. The personal were unfriendly and had no professionality and argued with us ie they had no responsibility to do anything. 

So, please Do not book here, this is not A serios hotel! 

Other hotels hearing about this informed this is against the law and therefore recommended to call the police as well as Making a reclamation. Since we were foreigners the hotel probably thought we should not be notified about the law. 

Also be aware the hotel Could not show they had informed us, just trying to get away with this as a storytel.

So, imagine this can be you if booking at this hotel, Do not take that risk! Besides this many people in the lobby seemed unhappy and while finding another hotel the underground just located under the hotel notified about a bad Location. 

This must be worst situation ever in life while going to stay at a hotel...and are experinced travellers. 

Hotel oriente in Barcelona should definately be avoided. What hotel sends a bokning confirmation, cancells the reservation and can not show proofs and are not willing to find a solution 🤮😤😢",1,2019,05,04
60,Great Location but Not Worth the Headache,Great location on Las Ramblas was the only positive to this hotel.  Arrived on April 25th and was assigned room 303 which was directly on Las Rambles.  Immediately noticed that the room was a hot box.  We were surprised since this hotel advertises as having air conditioning available.  We contacted the front desk and were advised that the hotel is running the heater system and if we wanted our room cooler than we should open the two balcony doors.  This would not have been an issue if we where not on the noisiest street in all Barcelona.  The week of our stay was also the week where Barcelona was playing Liverpool and there where daily riots of fans daily with swat and policy activity.  The chanting from the street kept us up most nights.  The hotel management was not accommodating at all.  We where promised a fan that was never delivered to the room.  We would of been much better off staying several blocks away from Las Ramblas.  Do not expect the hotel staff to accommodate.  The hotel manager stated that the heater stays on since he has seen snow as late as June (complete fallacy).,1,2019,05,04
60,"Great location, friendly staff","We stayed here in April 2019 for four nights.  I'd booked it and then was worried about being on the possibly busiest street in Barcelona.  No need to worry.  We had a room on the second floor.  We didn't have a scenic view but there was no noise, very quiet at night.  We stayed room only as breakfast was 12 euro each, each day and I thought that was quite excessive.  The rooms are basic. However they were extremely clean.  Maids came every day.  There is a free safe in the room.  the shower is awesome. beds very comfortable.  There were no tea and coffee making facilities and we had taken some supplies.  I had a word with the reception staff and they kindly provided a kettle for a 20 euro deposit.  Returned it at the end and was no problem.  Staff were incredibly helpful and polite at all times.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Only one downside was that the room was very warm (spot the English) and the air conditioning did not seem very powerful, however it was just enough and we did not question this",5,2019,05,01
60,"Great location, very friendly and helpful staff. Nice, clean & contemporary rooms","Very clean rooms, contemporary style. Perfect for a city break. Beautiful architecture inside and out of the hotel. On the main street - Las Ramblas. Staff are very friendly and happy to help. Good breakfast. Highly recommended. A good 3 star hotel!",5,2019,04,26
60,Noise Noise Noise,"Check in staff very friendly and helpful, could not fault them at all.
First room we were put into was clean (although quite a small bathroom but no real issue there), room felt quite hot, we tried to turn the air con to cool and then to off, to no avail, we eventually called reception to be told that Oct-May the air con blows out HOT air, we were not offered any further advise other than this. After spending the night sweating (we couldn't have the doors open as the noise from Ramblas is terrible) we again explained that the air con was not even turning off so faulty,they swapped our room that day, we did however have to pack all our belongings and leave them in a locked room by reception (not ideal when it contains your passports, money, etc), only to have to unpack them again when the room was available. 
The second room was bigger and our cases were in the room for when we returned, however it was quite dirty, our suitcases were covered in dust from the floor by the time we came to leave.
The walls in this room were so thin we could hear our neighbour talking on his mobile until the very early hours of the morning, which again ruined our nights sleep (Not great with a 7 year old) - nothing the hotel could do about this so we didn't complain.
We requested an extra pillow on the third night, however this never came and no one came or called to tell us this was the case. The fourth night we again requested extra pillow, this time we were advised none left but we could have blankets which werent ideal but needed.
All in all if your ok with noise then this is the place for you!",3,2019,04,17
60,Stay here only if you love La Rambla,"Yes the location is amazing for those who wish to be smack on La Rambla (a clueless relative did the booking and in his book locaton is everything) which is arguably the most noisy and crowded shopping and dining street in Europe but the hotel itself is a let down.
What the Oriente lacks most is character and atmosphere because the interiors are bland hostel like furnishing, definitely not something you would expect in a hotel that charges almost 200 EUR a night.
The breakfast was truly awful and that added insult to injury.",2,2019,04,17
60,Very Disappointing Visit,"Booked this hotel after viewing website. There were 3 of us travelling together so we booked what appeared to be a large, spacious room with 3 separate beds. The reality was very different. This was not a triple room but a twin with an extra bed squeezed into the room. There were 3 beds, one desk and one desk chair in the room. The desk chair was in the corner of the room because there was no space for it to be placed under the desk as the desk was so close to the foot of one of the beds. We had to stand aside to allow each other to pass at the end of the bed! There was a single pillow on each bed and no spare pillows in the room. On requesting extra pillows a man at the front desk told us there were NO extra pillows in the hotel but there would be some available the next day, whilst his female companion muttered under her breath ‘ maybe’! I contacted Jet2 City Breaks, with whom we had booked, about the size of the room and the lack of pillows. I was advised that the local rep would speak to the hotel manager & get back to me. The rep texted me to advise we would be given extra pillows but we should speak with the team at the front desk re the issues with our room. We did speak with a gentleman at the front desk who apologised for the inconvenience, the hotel was full but we would moved to a bigger room the next day. When we went to the desk the next morning to arrange a different. bigger room, the lady of the ‘maybe’ pillows advised there were no bigger rooms available, that all the triple rooms were the same size. When we asked to see a different triple room she simply said none were available. I would not recommend this hotel for anything ! The rooms are small and uncomfortable and the staff not particularly friendly or indeed helpful. I have complained to Jet2 by email and have filled a customer (dis)satisfaction survey but 10 days after submitting these and 14 days after returning home I am still awaiting a response from Jet2 holidays! Never again!!!",1,2019,04,13
60,City break,Just back from a four night stay in Barcelona. We arrived at about 3 pm  at the oriente and had a very easy checkin. Our room was on the second floor and not on the street side which I was glad of as I’d heard it could get very noisy on that side. The room was very clean and had an amazing shower. We were room only and found a nice coffee shop called the artisan for breakfast which was just across the road and 3 good restaurants one just round the corner from the hotel called Bar Cañete and the other 2 are through the square called Gran Viana and gourmet Sensi ,4,2019,04,13
60,Excellent location,"We caught the aerobus to this hotel which drops you at La Place Catalunya, a 10 minute walk down La Rambla to the hotel. Stayed here for 3 nights and overall it was a very good experience.Unfortunately our room wasn't ready at 2pm as promised so we went for a stroll for an hour or so.We had upgraded to a luxury double but be aware that this means it is a twin bedded room.When questioned on this we were told that nearly all their rooms were twin beds.After a conversation they agreed that the next day the room would be made up as a double.This did happen, they pushed the beds together and made up as one bed. (thank you Eva for sorting this).The mattresses are quite firm and the pillows are a sort of memory foam.The bed linen was of good quality, white and spotless, same for the towels.
The room was a good size and had a free mini bar which was very useful. Water and soft drinks, kit Kat and a packet of crisps.The shower was very good but the bathroom was a bit smelly.Tip: put the bin over the drain in the floor and spray perfume liberally !
The atriam where the buffet breakfast is served is light and airey and the food was really very good qulaity with an impressive variety offered.All staff at the hotel are friendly and helpful.
The room over looked La Rambla which is busy but the double glazed doors cut out the majority of the noise.We slept very well.Im not sure how well the air conditioning would work in the summer as it looked a bit old.It is not available until May.The wifi was free and good.
Check out was fast and efficient.Overall a good experience and would probably stay here again",4,2019,04,12
60,Fabulous!,"We had pre booked the Aerobus from the airport but this can be paid for when you land at €5.90 per person, it’s very slightly cheaper if you pre book. It was really smooth, got us there swiftly and without issue.
The hotel is fantastic in a great location on Las Ramblas, perfectly central for all of the places you may want to visit or to the Metro. I love the history which is dotted around the walls in photos and the outside looks like a film set.
Our room was directly overlooking Las Ramblas which is very noisy till about 4.00am, I’m a light sleeper which wasn’t great but my sons slept straight through (teenagers), maybe I should have had more wine! 
We didn’t have breakfast but there are so many places on your doorstep to choose from. The staff were friendly and helpful and, for anybody like me with claustrophobia, the staircase is wide and beautiful. The hotel is spotless, everywhere is clean and fresh, the shower very powerful - although it may be a little basic for some, I really can’t fault it and we would 100% stay there again.

",5,2019,04,10
60,Great Location for a stay in Barcelona,"We arrived at Barcelona airport and took a taxi to the hotel, which cost us 28 Euros (after 5 euros were added to the meter) the hotel was right on the Rambla pretty much central to either end.  Check in was quick and easy and we were directed to our room.  The room was VERY hot but we were on the top floor. The room itself was clean and spacious and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was pretty big, again clean with towels provided.  The shower was fairly powerful too which is always nice.  We didn't have the breakfast so can't comment on that, the hotel all in all was clean with friendly staff, there is a water machine in reception which was good but the water was quite pricey at 2.50 euro for a small bottle (outside you can get a large bottle for just over 1 euro) Our room was very quiet as well despite La Rambla being really busy.

Would I stay here again? Nope, not because of the hotel, we just didn't like Barcelona.",3,2019,04,08
60,Excellent room right off Las Ramblas,"We really enjoyed our stay here! There was one issue with the people next to us (they were letting their kids play out on the hallways at 7-8AM) but that was resolved quickly and the rest of the visit was amazing!

The rooms were comfortable and big enough for 2 people to easily live in.

The location was also great, right on the Main Street! We were surprised how quiet our room was when the window was closed.

The only thing we were hoping for was a better AC system, we kept trying to turn it on and it would just blow warm air.

Overall, we would stay here again when visiting Barcelona!",4,2019,04,08
60,Wow!,"When I saw the entrance to the hotel, I was a little taken aback. It was less than impressive, but immediately afterwards I understood why this hotel received such good reviews.
The location - unbeatable. Right in the middle of everything. Literally few steps from anywhere, and from the Liceu Metro station.
The room was such a pleasant surprise - spacious, functional, and comfortable, with a lot of space to hang and put the clothes. The biggest surprise was the little gifts that awaited for us in the room, accompanied with a hand-written note - who does that these days anymore? Wonderful!!
But the service - what can I say? Just perfect! So friendly, professional, and helpful.
I wish I could stay more in this hotel, and no doubt, that if I'm ever in Barcelona again, I will return to this place. Thank you so much for a wonderful experience.",5,2019,04,07
60,Nice hotel in excellent location,Nice hotel in a fantastic location on le Ramblas. Quick easy check in. large clean room. Really comfortable beds. Only downside was inter connecting door to next room which meant we could hear everything and the guests in next room were very loud and very late coming in and out. That said excellent value for money. Will return. ,4,2019,04,02
60,Brilliant sized triple room,"We stayed with 2 adults, a teen and a baby in cot. The room was extremely spacious which was excellent. We had a small balcony overlooking the side road which was quiet and nice to have.
The beds were comfortable and the housekeeping staff really made an effort for our arrival.
I would have liked an extra bin in the bedroom - the one in the bathroom was small and it was annoying having to go between the two rooms to bin things.
We didn't have a minibar or tea and coffee making facilities, which would have been good to have.
Excellent value for money and only minor improvements required!",4,2019,03,27
60,Great Hotel with wonderful friendly staff ,"We just checked out of this great hotel.   We were walk ins with no booking and the front desk staff were courteous and friendly and happily allowed us to check out their rooms before we stayed.   (other hotels in Barcelona were not so friendly or accomodating).   

The room was not a bad size, bigger than the place we just checked out of,  and the decor was ok.  Bed was comfy, with a choice of hard or soft pillows   Water pressure was excellent, towels were soft.  That ticks all my boxes for a hotel.  

We chose a room facing La Rambla with a balcony, next time we would choose a different room located at the back.   This is not the hotels fault at all. La Rambla is noisy!  La Rambla doesn’t sleep!  But that’s what brings people to it.  The balcony doors are double glazed and they do drown out a lot of noise but La Rambla never stops.   It’s actually quieter in the day than what it is at night.  Moving on... we had a few sleepless nights and a few more sleepins during the day.   😊 lessons learnt.  

Breakfast was included in our rate and it was a standard European breaky.   Cheese fruit pastries cold meats.  It also had bacon and eggs and baked beans.  An added bonus was you could indulge yourself in a glass of champagne as well!  All included.    

All in all we loved this hotel situated in a perfect location which employs perfectly friendly helpful staff. ",5,2019,03,26
60,"Location, location, location.","We spent 4 nights at this delightful hotel in Mar 2019, 2 adults and 2 kids. We had opted for a family room which had 2 single beds(joined together) and a comfortable sofa bed for the kids. The only hiccup we had was at check in since there were only 2 check in counters and a LOT of guests at check in. The breakfast spread is different each day and is a sumptuous offering. Great selection of fruit, yogurts, cold cuts and eggs - good enough to tank up for a full day of walking.  The serving staff were always welcoming and nothing was too much to ask for. Did I mention the selection of coffee options? Awesome indeed. Highly recommend for families. You cant beat the location with a metro station at 100 m, a McDonalds and KFC across the street and a Plaza for varied selection of eating options about 50 m away. La Boquria is 200 m away.",5,2019,03,21
60,Nice hotel at Ramblas,Rooms are small but housekeeping was  quite O.K..  Bathroom not that good.  When you shower water come out on the floor and there are chances to slip. Location of the hotel is perfect nearby to all the sights. Front desk applied a very high exchange rate.,3,2019,03,19
60,"good hotel, good location but very noisy","The hotel was very well located for the things we wanted to do.  Reception staff were very good and friendly.  Room was spotless clean.  Beds made  up every day.

Can't fault the hotel, but extremely noisy on a night time, struggled to sleep.",4,2019,03,14
60,Great location for exploring ,"My wife and I stayed for 3 nights in a room on the 4th floor overlooking la Rambla. The hotel is a beautiful old building yet rooms feel modern, bathroom was fine with toiletries provided and a powerful hot shower. We took teabags but there were tea/coffee making facilities provided. We didn’t have breakfast so cannot comment on that but breakfast area looked light and airy and plenty of other guests were taking advantage of the service.
The hotel is in the perfect spot for getting around this amazing city, you can walk up and down La Rambla, the beach and ports are within walking distance and there are at least 3 metro stops nearby which we used to get across to the camp Nou.
As others have said there is some street noise if you have a balcony overlooking La Rambla but it all adds to the experience in our opinion.
Recommended ",4,2019,03,11
60,Excellent value for money,"Location couldn't be better. Right on the world famous Las Ramblas. Definitely worth booking a de luxe room overlooking the street. You may suffer a little street noise but it is the sound of a wonderful city outside your room. However the double glazing is very efficient in blocking out the noise. We were staying in early March so can't make any comments on the air con which we are certain would be important in their hot summers.
 We requested a high room and that is what we were allocated by their very charming,efficient and helpful staff. Two lifts available and even at meal times the waits were never too long.
Our very clean room was  not big but not too small. Comfortable beds,well appointed bathroom with complimentary toiletries and towels all replenished daily. A fridge with stocked with complimentary soft drinks and confectionery was a nice touch of welcome.Ample storage space and hangers.No English channels on TV but we did not miss them. The wifi was fast and constant.  
The Orient has a very typical Spanish ambience from it's exterior architecture to it's traditional interior and it's relaxed welcoming atmosphere. 
The breakfast was very good for starting the day. Good selection of cereals,fruit,drinks,juices,bacon.sausages, eggs,breads,etc. The breakfast room was light and airy and always plenty of room (although this may have been because we were there in March).
We would have liked a bar to return to in the evening to relax in but a bottle of wine in the room bought locally sufficed. I am not certain whether this facility is available in the summer season.
The hotel's location is perfect for a visit to Barcelona.. We are well into our 70's and walked everywhere. Including Sagria Familia, The telerific,Port Vell, Montjuic,etc.etc. It is so convenient for the Metro and buses. 
No pool,no spa, no gym,but why do you need them if you are in Barcelona for it's magnificent architecture,museums,gastronomy and vivacity.
 The Orient is ideal for you, we thoroughly recommend it for your Barcelona exploration.",4,2019,03,10
60,Lovely Hotel in a great place,"We have just stayed in this hotel for a long weekend.  I’ve booked directly with the hotel, and this included free breakfast and free cancellation, and price was more than reasonable.  Before we arrived i’ve written to the hotel and asked if there was tea facility in the room, but was told that theres no such facility, however they said that i could ask for a kettle against a deposit of €20.   So knowing this we took some teabags and sugar with us. 
We arrived late at night, and found a very helpful receptionist.  Well, all the front office staff were very nice, or better all the staff were very nice and sweet to the customers.  The room was very clean, and tidy, and well organised, just as the bathroom was,  surely nothing to complain about.  The hotel is situated in the centre of Ramblas, and very close to the Metro, giving you easy access to anywhere you want to go.   Breakfast a buffet type was delicious, and offered a large variety from, English breakfast, to salads, cheese, and fruits, etc.  
Highly recommended, you would not be disappointed.",5,2019,03,05
60,Great weekend ,"My wife and I went here for a long weekend we asked beforehand if we could have a room on the front we arrived and greeted by the most helpful and pleasant reception staff and was given room 201 a balcony room with great views of La Rambla
The room was clean and tidy and bathroom was the same and shower was great 
We didn’t have breakfast as there’s so many places to eat only thing we did miss was a tea coffee facility’s in the room but there’s a McDonald’s across the road along with bars and restaurants 
As the room was in the front it was noisy at times but we wanted to be able to watch and see La Rambla at different times of the day and night 
We would Definitely stay here again when we come to Barcelona thank you to all that run it ",5,2019,02,27
60,BARCA TRIP,"Lovely Hotel staff were very friendly nice clean place very central to everything right on la Rambalas
metro stop close by plenty of restaurants and bars Mcdonalds and burger king directly opposite AND WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF THE HARBOUR",4,2019,02,21
60,Short break in Oriente Atiram,"When we arrived there were nice staff at reception welcoming us. 
Room was nice and perfectly clean, bathroom too. 
Rambla was noisy during the night but I sleep deep so I didn’t care. We also red other reviews and we were prepared. But don’t think it would be better to book somewere alse because everywere is the same.
Location is great! Price was great! We have booked room trough them web site and you get better price.
We had small balcony and beautiful view..
We enjoyed our stay there. We enjoyed Barcelona. 
On the end nobody at reception told as Thank you  what would be nice touch. But anyway, it was nice. Thank you!",5,2019,02,19
60,"Nice people, not so great room","We arrived late in the night. We talked to two very nice gentlemen. They gave us our cards. We just wanted to sleep since we were tired. 
The room is clean but the hotel is old and not very inviting (room only). The Italian shower was more of a tiny spot with nowhere to put soap. 
The walls were not painted properly. It’s old and not well kept up. 
It seems you are in a 2* hotel. The phone line was not working. We had a tone but nobody was answering at the front desk. We wanted an extra blanket. The room was cold. 
Anyhow we were too tired to get out and talk to the front desk. In the morning by 10:00 am we went to the breakfast room (we paid extra on line). The place is nice and the servers as well. The problem was the food. The coffee and milk coming from a machine did not taste right. Beside fresh fruits everything else was not up to par. 
So we checked out and left. I don’t think I’ll be back in this hotel.

60,The only reason I stayed there was because I am a rugged man who can adapt to any situation.,"I was part of a group of 10 runners that was going to do the 1/2 marathon of Barcelona, ​​which took place on Sunday 10 February, and who chose this Hotel for the location, near the starting point and the city center, where "" we slept"" on the night of Saturday to Sunday. The hotel building was inaugurated on April 21, 1842 and was an event since it was the first hotel in the city to incorporate lighting, with the new technology to realize it with the incipient ""Light of Gas"". In 1931 the hotel takes its name from ""Hotel Oriente"". Today the hotel belongs to the chain Atiram, which restored both the interior and the facade to leave it in a modern and comfortable. However there are still very old areas (not visible yet) where you are working for your total restoration. The current building has two floors more than the original but maintains some vestiges of its Franciscan past, such as the Hall Condal, which was the cloister of the old school. Now this room is unused because it carries out restoration work. I admired its interior appearance with many restored details, such as banisters, marble stairs and in particular the entrance seen from the outside. However, there is already a state of degradation that forces new restoration work. And the most of this hotel ended here, since the rest, other than breakfast, was very bad. We booked 3 rooms: Two with 4 beds and one with three. I arrived early and checked in. Then I went to the bedroom, and to my astonishment, instead of four beds, I had 2 beds and a double bed. On the website of the Hotel there is no room with 4 beds, but it is visible in the 3 that the beds are individual. I returned to the reception and after a rather tense dialogue, in which the receptionist stated that all the rooms with the 4-bed configuration had a double bed, I was able to change it to a room as I intended. The rest of the group arrived and after setting up we went out for dinner. We returned to a night of absolute rest, which did not happen. The rooms were located on the first floor, and with the noise of the Ramblas, coupled with the fact that the doors to the balconies did not have enough acoustic barrier, no one slept well. It is unacceptable that a hotel in this area does not proceed to the placement of an acoustic barrier that does not damage the comfort of its guests!",2,2019,02,14
60,Great Location ,"Hotel is perfectly located. Nothing glam about it, lots of lovely marble gives a lovely classical feel. But on the whole the hotel feels like a bit of an ageing star. That being said absolutely fabulous location and good value. Very helpful receptionists and lovely memory foam pillows! ",4,2019,02,12
60,Excellent location,Lovely hotel. In an excellent location on Las Ramblas close to lots of bars and restaurants. We had a deluxe room at the front of the hotel with a balcony.  It is very clean and staff are very nice plus the breakfast was plentiful and tasty..... What more can you want.  Would recommend,4,2019,02,12
60,great location!!,"bang on la ramblas....a tourist cannot seek a better location. buzzing with activity, tourists, restaurants, shops, and all!! 

comfortable rooms with a small balcony. we chose one which opens to the side avenue to minimise the noise from the busy streets.

the breakfast was also very good and elaborate.

the hotel staff was courteous.

overall....a good experience.",4,2019,02,09
60,Great location.,"Stayed for 3 nights at the end of January. Got the aerobus, the last stop is at the top of Las Ramblas and approx 10 minute walk to the hotel. 
We arrived at 11am and out room was available for us to have early which was great. Friendly and welcoming reception staff. 
Room was basic but clean. Mattresses a little uncomfortable. Room cleaned each day. 
We had a room overlooking Las Ramblas and like people have said it was noisey all night with traffic etc. Didn't bother us but if you are a light sleeper I wouldn't recommend. 
Check out was 12pm so no rush on out last morning.",4,2019,02,03
60,Perfect location!,"Just returned from a family city break to Barcelona, our first time.  

The hotel is a perfect location on Las Ramblas and within short walking distance to many great spots, la boqueria, the gothic quarter, the beach, or a metro station very near to travel further.  

The receptionist was very helpful and kind and made our visit extra special by chatting to the children and offering good recommendations as well as giving clear and simple directions to places we wanted to go.

Room was lovely and clean with 2 singles and a pullout sofa for a double to accommodate our family of 4. We had 2 balconies that overlooked Las Ramblas which were really an added bonus. In the evening we could put the children to bed and look out the balcony with a glass of wine to feel a part of it all!  I had read reviews about the noise from this street and I did notice it, but I would wake in a silent hotel too, the kids and my husband never heard any noise and slept well.  Las Ramblas is certainly alive all night but if you are a light sleeper it is nothing some earplugs couldn’t fix.

I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2019,01,29
60,nice location At the Rambla and near the cruise port,"I stayed with 2 of my friends in this hotel for 2 nights after our cruise trip . The receptionist r so kind and friendly they treat us as members of family, talk and smile and laught . they help us and reply all our questions, really they r great . the rooms r small but comfortable . we enjoyed our stay at this hotel",5,2019,01,28
60,"Great place, value for money!","A good place for those who want to travel the city and only sleep and take a shower in the hotel.
Located in the center of Ramblas.
Very clean, cleaned every day properly. 
I do not see a reason to take a hotel more expensive",5,2019,01,25
60,very good,"Friendly and helpful staff. Great location, with the possibility of walking to many attractions. The walls of the rooms are not very thick with relative noises from the other guests. In general very good.",4,2019,01,25
60,Great staff ,"The best thing about this location is how friendly the staff is. Daniel was especially kind to us. He’s got a true passion for food and he gave us excellent dining recommendations. The hotel is nice and they’re currently Renovating the rooms to make them more modern. As an American, I like ice. I like ice in my drinks, and I like to have access to ice because I’m prone to migraines and I often need it for my ice pack. One of my chief complaints is that ice is not easily accessible. I bought my own at a convenience store down the street, but when I got back, they had no bucket for me  to put it in. I don’t hold this against them as, culturally, ice isn’t as much a part of European food/ beverage culture. I thought I’d mention it because I would like to have known so I could prepare accordingly. 
They provide one pillow per person, but they will bring more if you ask. The showers have fantastic water heaters and the water pressure is truly amazing. The location is ideal if you want to be in the thick of touristy Barcelona. The rooms that face La Rambla tend to be louder at night, so if you’re a light sleeper, you may want to request an interior room. 
It is nice to be in such a central location because shopping and other various needs can be easily met because pretty much everything you might possibly need is within walking distance. However, it’s a bit shady at night. As a touristy street (la rambla) is ripe with pick pockets and the southern half of the famous thoroughfare becomes a bit of a red light district at night. If you are traveling in a group and you are careful with your belongings, you shouldn’t have an issue - but, again, it’s something I wish I had known. 
The subway is just across the street which is good and bad. It’s great to have an easy access point, but when the train passes by, the whole room vibrates and rumbles. 
If you are traveling with family and get a larger room, you will most likely get a room with two twin beds (pushed together) and a sofa bed. We put our sofa bed mattress on the floor and that helped a lot, but if you’re not a fan of sofa beds, I recommend getting two separate rooms or staying elsewhere. I don’t want to bag on the hotel. It definitely has its high points. Again, the staff is just fantastic. I think overall, the hotel is a great place for younger people who love shopping and night life, or for heavy sleepers who aren’t bothered by loud noises. 
For those of you who are curious it’s around 11:15 pm - we are on the fourth floor and with all our windows shut motorcycles, the train, buses,cars, and the chattering and laughter of people on the streets can be heard from the street below. The restaurants and bars on La Rambla have outdoor seating on a very large median in the middle of the road, so people often sit out there for a long time chatting and eating/ drinking. Right now a group of drunk guys are out there singing loudly. Again, depending on the kind of person you are, this could be a a very good thing or a bad thing. Regardless, it’s good to know. ",3,2019,01,22
60,Mr,The hotel is ideally situated on the main of La Ramblas.  Many visit sites are close within walking distance. The hotel is of good standard and staff friendly and helpful. Many food outlets are in the area.,4,2019,01,10
60,functional and a bit quirky,"Location is ideal for Las Ramblas and most other places.  An interesting building with a sense of history that’s been adapted by a modern hotel group.  Staff on reception were friendly and helpful. Taxis were easy to get and the rooms spacious with a good view.  Normal complaint of plug socket being no where near the bed but other than that the room was more than adequate.  WEhad a door mat and welcome pack saying ‘WOW - Guest of the day’ which was nice - pack included bottle opener, foot gel, pillow spray, salsa, olives and vermouth in a linen bag.  It was a nice touch and was appreciated.  Two other things would have been nice - a non slip mat for the bath (it is a deep bath and gets slippery) and an iron or the chance to use one (the hotel offers an ironing service but when want to freshen before a cruise it becomes expensive).
Breakfast is in an odd space and is itself strange.  There is a sign asking you to wait to be seated but I advise against it as it can be ages before staff come out.  There are two helpyoruself coffee machines but the cups are on the other side of the room.  There is a toaster - but it is an unusual button operated thing.  Scrambled eggs are good but the rest of the cooked items are not.  Selection of colds available.
I enjoyed my stay here - the free minibar of soft drinks was useful and it was good for it’s price point.",4,2019,01,05
60,Absolutely brilliant  😁,"
We had a wonderful stay over Christmas 
I had to request extra blankets because I am a frosty as but definitely need extra pillows 😥
We didn't pay for five star and the room was fine for a few nights, clean and tidy, Brilliant sttaff

Oh boy ...the location was perfect, right on La Rambla
Could not get any better!

60,Great location,"Great location, the reception perssonel are extraordinary, the hotel is not new but is verry clean with a nice breadfast , we stay for 2 nights  after arriving from a cruise on the mediterraneo, for us was the perfect location without a car.",5,2018,12,30
60,Great Location and Clean Hotel,"We stayed at the Oriente Atiram Hotel recently (Nov. 18').  The Hotel is located directly on La Rambla and the noise can be a bit loud at times, but know this going in and you will be fine.  We had a Deluxe room with balcony and this was perfect for us.  Nothing better than opening the doors and stepping outside seeing all of the activity and nightlife taking place right below you.  The room was basic, clean and provided 'most' everything necessary.  The room was comfortable and the bed was fine.  The only minor issue that we had was there is no iron or ironing board but the staff recommended a laundry cleaning service one block away.  The laundry cleaning service was inexpensive and allowed us the opportunity to visit the beautiful city of Barcelona and not concerning ourselves with ironing clothes.  The breakfast was simple and provided a variety of items that should accommodate most visitors.  

I can honestly say that beyond the Hotel the best part is the Staff.  They were always there to help making our stay the best.  If you get the opportunity to meet 'Daniel' at the front desk he will ensure that you are Welcomed, provide recommendations and make your stay enjoyable.  Thanks to the entire Hotel Staff as they made our stay perfect!",5,2018,12,08
60,Faultless,Perfect location for a break.Staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are comfortable and spotless. Price we paid was very reasonable. We had plenty of communication in the lead up to our trip to confirm our needs. 10/10,5,2018,12,05
60,Great location but basic,"The hotel is located down the bottom end of the Rambla which is a great location close to some great restaurants and bars, particular in the streets leading off La Rambla.  The hotel itself was fine and the staff friendly; it was also surprisingly quiet, considering the busy location which was a real bonus.  Waiting to check-in and the check-in itself took quite a long time so this process could be reviewed to save waiting time.  The room was basic but clean, although not the room type requested at the time of booking which was disappointing.  Four coat hangers were provided, which just isn't enough for two people!  More coat hangers were requested from reception on the first day but these weren't provided.  Overall, I would agree with its 3* rating and I would stay there again due to the fantastic location.

Breakfast every thing u could want hot and fresh in a stunning area if u want English food which we didn’t was opposite outside only downside steps to a lot of rooms and dining area and only two lifts but wasn’t to much of problem as a traveler with mobility problems staff could not have been more helpful",5,2018,12,04
60,Weekend with friends,"We arrived from Barcelona airport early (taxi fare less than €30.00, about 20 minutes) and our rooms were not ready. . Absolutely no problem, it was 10.30 in the morning. Could not check in, but were able to leave our bags. Done a quick bit of sightseeing and returned to check in. Check-in was quick and easy. We were allocated Room 444, 4th floor, our friends were allocated Room 425. Our room was clean, but a bit on the small, compact size. Our friend's room, meanwhile, was much bigger. They booked a twin room, whereas we booked a double room. We had a bath and shower, but no dressing table, fridge or any seats which were all in our friend's room, which just had a shower. We asked immediately could we change to a bigger room, but none were available. Breakfast was fine, good choices, and breakfast room was on the 1st floor. Foyer was sizeable enough. The following morning, our first, the bed was made and the room cleaned, but there were no replacement towels or floor mat. 
At check-out we mentioned these facts, smaller room, less facilities, no towel replacement etc., but were told that some rooms were bigger than others, and that the towels issue would be mentioned to the housekeeping team. We enquired about a discount, as both rooms were booked at the same time and at the same price, but were told than no discount could be offered. The reception team were very friendly, professional and efficient. 
Really great location on Las Ramblas, not too far from Licieu metro station",3,2018,12,02
60,Nice hotel barcelona,Had 4 night holiday break with 3 other friends and stayed in this hotel.We thought it a reasonable price for its location.Our room was quite large on 3 rd floor not on street and was very quiet.Good bathroom although shower leaked a little but it was very large.  nice friendly staff at reception beautiful breakfast room lots of choice for breakfast lovely quality of fruit and cheeses.English breakfast as well but I gained enough weight over the few days without that as well.One night we said we would try their dinner in restaurant  it didn’t like the look of it.It seemed a bit down market for dinner.Loved the hotel and I saw price of room and I think I saw 67 euros per night.We would definitely go back good value for money nice well run hotel,5,2018,11,29
60,Average stay,"Great location and value for money until charged for breakfast....what a waste of money. We thought breakfast was included in price and wouldn't have eaten it otherwise. Really not happy as wasn't explained to us. We look forward to hearing your response and perhaps a refund? The rooms are so hot at night and we were kept awake most of the Saturday night due to excessive noise, banging and doors slamming.
Really would like the money back for breakfast. Also wasn't explained that Wi-Fi was included either. ",3,2018,11,26
60,Good if planning on not being in room too much and somewhat of a shady staff.,"We stayed at oriente for 4 nights and for the price and location we expected it to be basic but boy was it bare. No fridge, no coffee maker, and the safe requires you to go get a key in order to use it. Not to mention the hotel is very dated to the point it just didn’t feel clean and well kept. 

Upon check in the first room we got was facing the back and the room was bare blank a queen size bed is just 2 small beds pushed together which we experienced before but they didn’t even attempt to use sheets to tie them together when we slept at night the beds would separate from the middle and slide. instantly I saw a stain on the sheets the room looks like it hasn’t been touched in months  but soon that was the least of our problems as after using the toilet was MAJOR leaking water gushing out the pipes. Luckily upon calling the front staff he immediately offer to move us and gave us a room with a front facing view he was extremely friendly and helpful. We realize things can happen and it’s not ever intended to put guests in a room with issues but on the other end of it a leaking no, GUSHING water  toilet ? that should be caught. 

The new room was just as bare but the view of the street and balcony somewhat made up for it and we knew we wouldn’t be spending too much time in there so the rest of our stay was fine until the last day which Is leaving a bit of a bitter memory. 

Our flight leaving Barcelona was quite early we needed to be at the airport at 3AM. We took the aerobus and transferred onto the metro when arriving and exclusively used the public transit system throughout the trip so very unfamilar with how taxis and their frequency especially at 3am. So we asked the front desk (wish I got his name now) what the frequency is like and if it’s easy to get one and we knew about the mytaxi app as well and he said it’s not difficult to get one but we should definitely reserve one and really convinced us and we just thought why not? How nice of the hotel - so we thought.

He knew it was just the 2 of us and when we came down stairs to get in the taxi it was a large taxi that can carry 5-8 and unsure at that point before getting in if it’s more for bigger ones like in other countries we got on and that was that. We used the mytaxi app and got a rough estimate it would be 35 euros and that was what we expected and when we arrived the taxi charged us 50 Euros. And keep in mind it’s 3am no traffic took 20 minutes. And with a quick google search I realized larger taxis do cost more and I wondered why in the world would hotel call a large taxi for 2 of us and then I realized he must get some sort of a kick back or commmission from the taxi because he REALLY insisted we set one with him and that leaves a bitter taste in my mouth for that shadyness. 

So would I recommend the Oriente? No. The location was great but there are other options in that price range in that area. But I’m really writing this review as a PSA if you’re going to provide a service like calling a taxi which is standard don’t be shady and get your guests something they don’t even need and get them overcharged. Or even if it’s not shady and I’m overthinking it then due the due diligence and call them a taxi they need. I would imagine some bigger groups of families needing a XL taxi but for 2 of us and 2 suitcases? No. 

Also pro tip: the street was filled with taxis at 3AM and if your flight comes in during normal hours I believe the Aerobus starts running at 6am it’s about 6-7 euros one way and the subway is another 2.20",2,2018,11,24
60,A good place to stay but .....,"Hotel staff is first rate.  Location is first rate.  We are talking Las Ramblas here.  Within walking distance of a metro station. Price is decent.  Clean, however Room 221 has bed bugs.  My spouse was eaten alive and she is still itching two weeks later.  Our beds were separate so I was not bitten.",2,2018,11,24
60,Not satisfied,"Hotel was clean however very basic, so glad I decided to take a kettle!
Only one pillow each on arrival so had to request another, the room was boiling (in November) when I asked if my room thermostat was working, I was told the whole hotel is set to winter temperatures therefore could not be adjusted by room, very disappointing and 3 days of no sleep due to the heat!
In addition, 2 days out of 3, the maintenance personnel tried to get into our room, unsure why!! luckily for us we managed to jump into the bathroom naked before we were seen, not good when as a couple you want privacy on a mini break!! 
Will not be returning",3,2018,11,21
60,Oriente Atiram on Las Ramblas,"We had the balcony room facing Las  Ramblas.  The view was amazing and exactly what we wanted!  We slept great as we found no issue with having a room facing Las Ramblas.  The breakfast buffet is very good and well worth the additional money.

There is a police station right next door.

Note that this hotel does not have air conditioning or fans in the room.  This is the only issue I had with the hotel as a senior citizen.",4,2018,11,20
60,Exploring by foot? It's all about LOCATION!,"If you want to experience Barcelona's unique vibe, food, drinks, markets and famous La rambla without a car, this hotel is the one! 2 min walk to subway station as well.
So, drop your stuff in the room and go explore! 

Even though the hotel gets quite busy, the staffs were very polite and helpful when I got in trouble with my phone stolen from a street (first day even before check-in!). They gave some advice and kept my other devices safe because I was paranoid. Also, great communications with emails and phone call before check-in. They speak English. 

I'd definitely stay again in this hotel. The exterior decor is so gorgeous and I can tell it retains awesome history.

Tip: Be aware the city can be loud at night and this hotel is located in the HEART of La rambla. Bring earplugs is the must if you want to get a good night sleep.",5,2018,11,19
60,Comfortable hotel right in the centre of things,"We stayed on a four day city break. The hotel is on the Ramblas and is brilliantly placed for eating, visiting the Gothic quarter and close to transport links to venture further afield. There are two subway stops within two minute walks and the Placa de Catalunya is just a little bit further on. The step-on-step-off buses can be joined at Calunya or at the Colom, which is a bit nearer to the hotel entrance.
The only slight problem with the hotel's location is that the room was quite noisy at night. The Ramblas is busy until after midnight. There is also some noise from the subway trains that run under the Ramblas.
The staff were very friendly and helpful throughout the stay. And they were always cheery when we met them.",4,2018,11,19
60,Great staff and very convenient for the city.,"Perfect position close to most of the city highlights. Very clean room, good breakfast and very friendly helpful staff. Would have been 5 stars if their air con worked, you can choose fresh air and lots of street noise or close the window and cope with a very warm room and this was November!",4,2018,11,16

60,Great Value hotel,"Its my 4th visit to Barcelona but this hotel was the best. It has an excellent location, it was a walking distance to every popular place. I got the Aerobus to the Catalunia square & then walked for 10mins to the hotel. I had bus from near Catalunia square to go to LA ROCA village . It costed 14 euro from the tourist assisst stations available everywhere, while the official bus is 20 euros & needs fixed time reservations. 
I had a La Rambla view room & it was incredible & definitely worth the money. It was not that noisy ( as some travellers complained). The hotel is neat , tidy , cosy with spacious room . Its great value for a 3 star hotel in a premium location.",4,2018,11,14
60,What a City and a great location to stay,"Middle of La Ramblas - Great Location, Friendly Staff, Felt very safe when out and about
Great value for money. Close to all amenities
Make sure you you explore the gothic quarter, and go to the Magic Fountains- La Boceria is close by, make sure you have a tapas at El Quim!!",4,2018,11,14
60,Wish you could score 4 and a half....,"Because this hotel was great, but not perfect.
20/30 mins in a very easy to acquire taxi from the airport (about 27E, clear meter, very trustworthy system and there were 4 of us so very much cheapest way around).
Bang on the buzzy fun La Ramblas.
Great location, bars and restaurants immediately outside.
We had La Ramblas rooms on 4th floor. Very clean, not luxurious but comfortable, bath which was lovely. 
Not a relais de silence, but firmly closing windows. You were always aware there was a lively street outside but that was actually fun. Aware of party people in the road, even at 6-15am when we were sort of thinking it was the following day...
But happily slept through it.
And that was the Saturday night.
Sunday night less boisterous...although the street cleaners do their stuff in small hours.
If you require silence for sleep don't have a front facing room.
Sadly, as quite often happens, the breakfasts were a bit disappointing.
Usual buffet (in terrific first floor atrium room with brilliant light which feels vast).
Why why why in Spain would they provide such poor quality orange juice?
(Think 1950s east Europe).
Hot food also rather poor. Vast sea of solid scrambled egg. One morning we discovered hopeful dish of fried eggs, but they were actually completely solid and rubber. 
Worlds slowest four slice toaster for the whole room.
But sad sliced bread so maybe not such a problem.
Two forms of cereal of which one was cornflakes.
If you confined yourself to the lovely melon and beautifully sliced pineapple, flaky custard pastries and used two teabags per cup you could do business there.
Sorry. Liked hotel but the breakfasts were poor. Some of our number just didn't bother after the first day.
Having said that.... if the middle aged couple who laid waste to the buffet with their SAS tactics are reading this, Shame On You. They humourlessly raided. Straight to the (dodgy) juice where they poured a desert trips worth into their vast flask). Then emptied fruit bowl, took huge amounts of cheese... why list it. It was on 11th November. You are adults and should be embarrassed. We were.
But don't let us put you off, we would still return.
Just go the very short distance to the amazing food market and eat there, which we more or less did the last day.
Front desk checkout took ages as the rather hardworking and pleasant staff member was inundated at checkout time. He needs assistance management.
Sorry this comes across as a bit negative, we liked the place and may very well use it again.
Barcelona is an Amazing Destination.
There is so much to see. 
It is exciting and vibrant and if you are hesitating don't. You need to go.",4,2018,11,13
60,"Basic but can’t complain, but will!","The hotel is in a great location and the staff were really friendly in spite of trying to move us to a sister hotel when we checked in due to their mix up. 

The room was small but adequate, but no spare pillow, no drink making facilities and no iron. When requested it appears this is the norm,but for a charge they will provide additional services.

The bathroom has a great shower if you don’t mind swimming on the floor due to a bad design? 

But all in all for the money it was good value.",3,2018,11,07
60,Excellent,"We have great experience during our time in Barcelona thanks to the services and hospitality of the front desk team and the people of the dinning room.  This place has excellent location. It is the 3rd times that we visit

The staff were very friendly and the room is very spacious as I was staying for 4 nights. It is generally clean and the only issue is the design of the bathroom is in such a way that water will leak the entire bathroom when you take a shower - but its not a huge deal for us although it may cause some discomfort. Other than that the stay was good given the proximity of location and space. Also, given that its within the party district there is no noise to the room which was wonderful.",3,2018,11,05

If you're going to book this hotel do make sure you get a room with a balcony, as the best bit was looking out over Las Ramblas at night, which provided lots of entertainment in the form of people watching, which was like watching street theatre. We didn't eat in the hotel at all, as it looked a bit uninspiring, but found good places just out of the centre. The room was expensive for what it was.",3,2018,10,30
60,Excellent Location,"After reading the reviews on this property my friends and I booked a room for the location.  Right in the middle of Las Ramblas and a few blocks from the Gothic Quarter, easy to walk everywhere we wanted to go.   Our rooms were nothing fancy but had the basics bed, shower, etc.  We didn't plan to spend much time in the hotel.  Be prepared to keep windows shut and air on at night if you are visiting on the weekend.  The celebrations go on all night but we were fine with the windows shut and were able to sleep.  The staff was very nice.  I would say that the location and staff were very nice.  The rooms are very basic and nothing fancy.   For the price and location it worked for us.",4,2018,10,30
60,Room without view,My room was terrible and there was always noise during the night. Very expensive room considering that the view was for a backyard with no natural light. You could listen the subway in my room. Staff was friendly but the reception was quite Antiquated.,3,2018,10,29
60,Excellent hotel,"This is not the first time I have been staying at the hotel. This is my favorite hotel in Barcelona. The hotel is located in the center of the Ramblas and a short walk from the important sites in Barcelona. The Gothic Quarter, the Bucaria Market and more. The L3 line (green color) is next to the hotel ( licu station). With it you can reach the king's fountains, the España station and from there you can take the train to Montserrat. Allso by this train you can go to  the Camp Nou football stadium( Palau Reial station). And  to the other direction to (north)  to Catalonia Square. Where the main station of most metro lines is located.

The Staff at the hotel are excellent. The front desk workers are very nice. They are very helpful and their service is always accompanied by a smile and courtesy. 
The hotel rooms are always clean and the room service is excellent. 

Breakfast is available at the hotel. The rich meal cost is 12 euros per person",5,2018,10,25
60,Not for families,"This hotel is a “tick in the box” as in .. good location, clean enough , but that’s literally it . Overpriced for what it offers .. little or no amenities .. no bar or restaurant (although they May argue outside across the road suffices) , no English tv whatsoever , all Spanish , room is like a hostel . To be honest for the money paid (approximately 170 per night room
Only ) off season , this is so poor . I’ve stayed in Barcelona previously and I advise anyone not to stay here but to stay a few minutes away in a better quality hotel for Same money.",2,2018,10,24
60,Good spot. Noisy!,In a great spot Nd the rooms are nice but is so noisy that I needed earplugs to sleep. The noise does not stop. The beds were average for comfort. Most of the staff were great except for one who was so stressed about being asked by a guest about which direction the beach was in that he had to hold his head in hands while he explained it to them (but he might have been having a bad day). I would stay again if I had to but probably not.,3,2018,10,14
60,"Basic, great location and staff","Three stars for the room, five stars for the location and staff.  The room was clean and fresh but very basic, it's in an older building and was fine.  The staff was super cool, and the location on La Ramblas was really good.  3 minute walk from a popular square for food, 10 minutes to the old city, a little more for everything else.  One block from the subway.  There are lots of people around at all hours, but I didn't hear the noise others were complaining about.  Our room was on the second floor and faced the main street, but the glass was doubled pained and it was way less noisy than my apartment in NY.  I guess if you're used to country living, then the occasional noise might be tough, but it really wasn't noticable.",4,2018,10,11
60,Disappointed on La Rambla,"This hotel was recommended by a few friends.  I don't know why.  They are younger than we are.  The hotel was good.  The lobby minimal.  The rooms, pretty minimal and small.  Breakfast was good, in a bright and spacious room, but after 4 or 5 days, the repetitiveness was getting old.  Our room faced La Rambla, and while the website touts soundproof windows, they weren't.  And, La Rambla is busy at all hours of the day or night.  On weekends, there might be some downtime at around 5am.  And, you could feel every subway train as it ran under the hotel.  No question, the location is great.  If you want to be surrounded by tourists, and shops and restaurants that cater to tourists, without very many locals mixed in, this is your place.  If you want to get a feel for the real Barcelona, this isn't for you.  We wanted the latter, and as a result were disappointed.",3,2018,10,10
60,Take the good with the bad,Front desk is way understaffed.  Allow plenty of time for that. Mattresses are very hard. Pillows are too small for the pillowcases which are open at both ends so a nuisance.  Desk mostly doesn't pick up phone so plan on going down there for help. Breakfast is good with plenty of fruits and vegetables.  Good coffee.,3,2018,10,10
60,Excellent hotel in a great location,"We, a group of 8, have just returned from a 5 day break here and we were impressed with the hotel and the staff. The rooms were large, clean with comfortable beds and plenty of storage and free security boxes (10 euros deposit if yours had a key and not a code).  The breakfast room was spacious, although cold with the air conditioning, and there was plenty of choice of food. The location was excellent, in the middle of Las Ramblas.",5,2018,10,06
60,Geting recharged for winter,"We had a great fortnight at this hotel. It was very central and we could do all the things we planned to do from our doorstep. The staff were excellent and went out of their way to be helpful. Our room was overlooking the Ramblas and we had a balcony to view all the celebrations on this street. It was perfect. The only thing I would recommend is that you take earplugs if you want to sleep at night, a very noisy area. There are quieter rooms at the back of this hotel, but then you miss the fun!",5,2018,10,03
60,Excellent location,"Stayed 2 nights before our cruise on Royal Caribbean. 
Excellent location, cleanliness & service.
Would definitely recommend.
We only had room only, which was a lovely room overlooking the street. We did not find the room noisy at all. Best location on Las rambalas.",5,2018,10,02
60,Great location! ,"I have been there for a week.
The hotel is on the Main Street of Barcelona,- La Rambla and very close to transportation (L4 metro line and more busses) and the Gothic area. 
The stuff was really friendly too. The breakfast is ok.

Great value for the money. ",5,2018,09,30
60,Everything we wanted in Barcelona,"This hotel has everything we wanted in Barcelona - good location right on La Ramblas, good wifi, great breakfast, and a clean room. We have no complaints at all.

The breakfast room is large and the selection is great. The staff is friendly and helpful. Our room (306) was small but big enough to sleep in, and the bathroom was a good size and the water pressure and temperature was fine.

The wifi speed was good - better than many hotels I've been in - and of course the location is excellent to see the sights in the old part of Barcelona.",5,2018,09,28
60,"EXCELLENT FRONT DESK, SERVICE AND CLEANLINESS. ALSO THE LOCATION WAS PERFECT, JUST IN THE THE CENTER OF LA RAMBLA.",",The room was beautifully decorated, had a large TV, free Wi-fI and spacious bathroom with extra towels.
Also the room was very clean and the cleaning maids were very attentive and courteous.
The location was in the middle of La Rambla where through the balcony you could see people fill the street even at 3:30 AM. It was also a few steps from The BOQUERIA MARKET which is a paradise for food lovers.
Special thanks to FLORENCIOS' son at front desk. He was extremely hepful and gave us advice on where the locals dine and shop.",5,2018,09,28
60,location is great walking distance from major attractions and public transportation,"room was very small other wise, because of the location I guess we can deal with a small room breakfast was very good staff was very friendly, they helped us store our luggage even after checkout because our next stop was 4 hours later",5,2018,09,24
60,Clean and basic but perfect base for exploring Barcelona,"The hotel is perfectly positioned on La Rambla and we felt we were in the heart of Barcelona with the beach area only a 15/20 minute stroll one way, the Liceu Metro station is virtually outside the hotel making access to the rest of the city easy including the airport. You are in the hub of the restaurants,  shops and also the famous La Boqueria market. The room it's self although compact with having 3 beds was acceptable and the bathroom of a good size. The small balcony was a nice touch (situated over a side street) Our room -235 - was dated and no doubt next in line for the refurbishment. We were disappointed that as a 3 star hotel we did not have coffee making facilities and on requesting some at reception were informed that only the deluxe rooms had it but were offered a kettle. We only had 2 electrical sockets which meant  a little planning between the 3 of us at times but it was manageable. We didn't have any issues from other guests noise as some reviewers have mentioned although my 2 friends did get disturbed on the first night from the sound of the Metro rumbling below ground but were OK after that. Overall I would recommend the hotel purely on the strength of it's position being a perfect base...I would rate the position as 5*",3,2018,09,24
60,Rather disappointed,"This hotel was the first hotel I ever stayed in in Barcelona about 20 years ago. I think it was owned by a family in those days as I remember quite a charming elderly man on reception who was probably a little disappointed that he would be retiring just before Barcelona was about to become the tourist mecca that it is today. So I wanted a trip down memory lane and although I had remembered that the hotel was located in the heart of the noisy Las Ramblas I think the volume of noise has increased exponentially since the late 90's. We had a 'deluxe' room on the first floor with a terrific view of all the activity. But that activity never stops...it is incessant day and night. Despite the double glazing it is impossible to completely shut that out. However, on our second and last morning worse was to come as a family staying further down our corridor allowed their three young children to use the corridor as a play room from about 6am. So, if you value peace and quiet check in somewhere else. Now on to the room. Well I can only say that I was underwhelmed. The furniture was quite dated and the bathroom was like a prison cell; functional but completely bereft of any sort of luxury - even the toiletries were basic. The safety box was unusable and the telephone didn't work. The rooms may have had a makeover in 2004 but frankly it appears that only the flooring was replaced. On the plus side the hotel is in a brilliant location if you're looking to stay right in the heart of Barcelona. Just remember to pack noise cancelling ear plugs and maybe a child trap.",3,2018,09,23
60,Terrible and loud!! Don't stay here,"We booked this hotel based on other reviews and location. Although the location is good (right on Las Ramblas and close to the Gothic Quarter) the hotel is not good at all. The walls are paper thin! We have not been able to get any sleep. We can hear the people in the other rooms talking, snoring, and turning on and off their lights! There is also a lot of street noise. I requested to change rooms and was told they are all equally as loud! We have one more night here and I wish we had time in our schedule to find a new hotel. I am very disappointed. My two small children who are usually heavy sleepers also cannot sleep. 
Also, the breakfast here is very overpriced and not very good. Please save your money and eat elsewhere. 
There is also a weird stain in our bathtub.",1,2018,09,12
60,My 25th Wedding aniversary,"The Hotel has a super good location, close to the Metro, easy access to taxis, hotel staff very nice and they explain us how to move around the city we had a noise bed the first night but as soon as we complaint the change it, love the stay and will visit again",5,2018,09,12
60,Beautiful ,Stayed here with my boyfriend for 4 nights. What a beautiful hotel and city. From the word go the staff here were so helpful. Louis was brilliant when checking us in after a delayed flight and our last evening was lovely just chatting to him 😊 Our second evening we wanted somewhere to eat and Manu gave us a great recommendation for a local bar with beautiful food and drink. Our room looked straight over Las Ramblas but despite it being busy we slept really well every night. I loved the little message on our mirror upon arrival and we even got a lovely little welcome pack as customer of the day. Breakfast was lovely too. Our last evening we sat in the restaurant terrace were both food and drink were great. 100% recommend and we shall definitely be back in the future ☺️,5,2018,09,09
60,.Short break in Barcelona,"Lovely character old style hotel. Peacefully quiet Comfy beds, spotlessly clean, excellent QUIET air conditioner in room, very helpful staff, nice breakfast. Will certainly re-stay on my next visit to Barcelona.",5,2018,09,09
60,great budget hotel,"The hotel was located in the centre of La Ramblas and close to subway.  Hotel staff was helpful in arranging visit to Montserrat on our own instead of paying higher tour fee.  Older hotel, 150 years but recently updated.  Would stay there on future visit to Barcelona.",4,2018,09,08
60,Great place to stay,"Just back from a four night mini break to Barcelona on a Jet2 City Break having visited with another couple.  We stayed at the Oriente Atiram as part of the deal, and can only say how much we enjoyed our stay.  With its main entrance straight onto Las Ramblas, and within a minutes’ walk of the Liceu Metro station, it’s ideally located as a central base for sightseeing and for eating out. The bedrooms, whilst not being over large, were spotlessly clean with very comfortable beds, and sufficient wardrobe space. The bathroom was fitted with a large walk-in shower with a powerful spray. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. Our stay was on a “room only” basis, though a breakfast is available at a cost of 12 euros. Whilst we didn’t have a breakfast the couple we travelled with did, and said it was good value. If you’re going to visit Barcelona, would strongly recommend this establishment.",4,2018,09,07
60,we love every second at  oriente Atiram,"the best location ever- you walk our  to the Rambla 
very close to shopping area at Katalonia squer 
 very clean rooms and all area at hotel 
- great breakfast- we had the room for 4 and we had a lot of space and very very friendly stuff !!
definitely will come back to this great hotel !!",5,2018,09,06
60,"Great location, super friendly staff","Really lovely, opulent hotel. Right on La Ramblas in the middle of the long street. Clean rooms, good powerful shower and plentiful breakfast. Really friendly staff from reception to housekeepers. Couldn't want for more. Gothic quarter is right across the road, Palau Guell is to the left and a few minutes walk. 20 mins to the beach and Port Vell. Couldn't be a better place for a city break. Really enjoyed this hotel.",5,2018,09,02
60,Great stay down La Ramblas ,"We’ve just got back from a couple nights stay at the hotel. We couldn’t really fault it at all. Room,  bathroom and shower were all spotlessly clean. We were expecting  it to be quite noisy as it is on the Main Street, however we didn’t hear a thing, even though I believe the hotel was almost booked up! Staff were really friendly. Our safe decided to stop working on the last day, but an engineer was called and dealt with it in under 10mins so wasn’t a problem at all. Loved Barcelona and loved being in the centre, it is a great location especially if you are only there for a couple of days.",5,2018,09,02
60,Very kind staff,"Great location at the Ramblas. Many restaurants around the hotel. There is also a metro station nearby. 
Kind and attentive staff who helped us when we needed them.
We only had one real inconvenience: one elevator was out of service in the morning and thus the other one was very busy. As my mother is on a wheelchair it took us at least 30 minutes to go downstairs. But this happened only once during our stay. ",4,2018,08,31
60,Very nice,"Right in the centre of all the excitement u could ever ask for in the beautiful city of Barcelona,spain. Reasonably priced..old restored building. Great customer service. 
Very nice hotel. Balconies. Nice restaurant ",4,2018,08,28
60,Great Hotel in Central Barcelona,"We were very impressed with this hotel which was so central and right on La Rambla which was ideal and very central and close to Place Cataluyna where the airport bus dropped us off and from where the Hop On Hop Off bus tours depart.  The room was spotlessly  clean, big and welcoming.  There was a good choice for breakfast and all the staff were so friendly.  I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2018,08,28
60,"Good, but noisy ","Pros: Great location, helpful and polite staff (fluent in English), good AirCo, comfortable bed. 
Con: you can hear everything that happens in the corridors: people talking, doors banging etc. There are many rooms, so chances are that you are going to have a noisy neighbor. And people go in and out all the time during the evening/night.
Tip: Get breakfast in one of the nice bakeries close to the hotel. You will get more variety for a lower price.",4,2018,08,28
60,Really good hotel and service,"I booked this hotel for my parents who were visiting me in Barcelona. Thanks Eva and Ferran for your gelapt the reception! 
My parents were really happy with this hotel. The service is excellent. The room (deluxe) was large and really clean with a beautiful view on La Rambla. The breakfast was perfect. Nothing to complain about. When my parents are returning to Barcelona, they definitely want to stay here again.",5,2018,08,27
60,Nice location,"We visited this place in June 2018.Location is superb if you are traveling by metro.The check in process was not smooth, we had to wait for approx 15 minutes.Top of that keys given to us were not working.We got the room facing Police station nearby so noise was not that much a problem.Its located on a busy street at Las Ramblas so there are plenty of options to chose from as far as food is concerned.There are plenty of shops down the three parallel lanes. Rooms are very basic with one power socket near the bed.They do provide breakfast option but we didn’t try.Cleanliness wise The place was ok",3,2018,08,26
60,Good location but very basic,"We decided to book this hotel as it was in a good location. We had a family room that although was clean was quote basic. Being a family of 4 we found there was not enough plug sockets in the room to charge our phones and tablets. There was only 1 socket at the end of the bed. We had to unplug the tv and room phone and plug 1 item in the bathroom next to a sink.
We had a room at the side of the building, when stood on the balcony we could still see las Ramblas. You could hear some noise at night but not to loud to keep you awake all night. 

We booked on a bed and breakfast basis as we knew we would be out all day and evening. We had breakfast 1 morning and didn't bother for our remaining 2 mornings.
The buffet was basic and did not have much choice at all. The hot food had little variety. The tea bags were extremely weak. 

Be careful in the morning if you pop out. My husband went out around 6.30am to get us a coffee, and a drunk tried to mug him, and he was propositioned on 2 occasions by prostitutes hanging around outside the hotel.

Would I return to Barcelona.... Yes! Would I return to this hotel... No. 
If your looking for somewhere very basic to just get your head down then I suppose this hotel would suit you. If you want somewhere a bit more luxurious, that does a good breakfast, I'd look elsewhere",3,2018,08,17
60,Lovely,"Perfect location on Las Ramblas, we were kinda afraid that we would not be able to sleep at night from the noise on the streets but this was no problem. Really nice staff at the reception desk. Clean rooms and comfortable beds. Only complaint that I can find is that the WiFi was kinda slow, but that is really a minor detail. Would definitely stay here again.",4,2018,08,11
60,Below expectations,"We booked a nice looking modern rooms as shown on the sites and when we reached we found out the hard way that there are renovated rooms and old ones, and yes you guessed it we got the old ones. Old furniture, old towels, thin walls, minibar closet with no minibar in it, had to carry actual metal keys with big key chain, top it all with waking up to noisy renovation works. My first trip to Barcelona and I believe the last. ",2,2018,08,10
60,Hot!!,"The hotel is located in a great spot but you'll find little to no amenities. We checked in around 1:00 and found a very hot room. They told us to let them know if it didn't cool down, which we did. When we complained again the 3rd time, they finally said they thought it was blocked and brought a fan around 2230 hours. We would have cancelled this room after first seeing it but since we booked ahead through another site, we would have lost our money for a 3 day stay.",2,2018,08,06
60,Just perfect!! ,"I would thoroughly recommend this hotel if visiting Barcelona. Right on Las Ramblas so you walk out the door straight into the buzz, and fabulous little cafes/bars/markets stalls/shops, and directly across from Plaza Real. Fantastic vibe. 
Very friendly and helpful staff, room was clean and spacious, bathroom/shower same. Great value for money. Perfect choice so will be back ☺️",5,2018,08,06
60,Great location in the middle of La Rambla,"The hotel is fairly clean, service is good and the breakfast was great.  The rooms does not have USB to charge phone, only one 110 outlet so if you have more than one person then you have to take turns to charge your phone.  It is a little noisy if your room is located on the street.  Overall not a bad experience.",4,2018,08,03
60,"Lovley hotel, great location!","I have reviewed the Oriente previously. I gave it a 5***** rating. After this last visit nothing has changed. High professional level of service, personal, cheerful, helpful and proficient reception staff. Room service and meals all excellent. I would like to add however, that on this occasion there was a taxi strike which made a difficult situation for tourists, and locals. I would like to mention two of the reception staff in particular; Daniel and Ieva who went above and beyond what is usually expected and helped to resolve the taxi situation for us. It took many phone conversations to do so. We were extremely grateful to them. Nothing was too much trouble for them; they were friendly, approachable and  pleasant. Thanks again Oriente for creating another good memory.",5,2018,08,03
60,Perfect location ,"The hotel is situated on la Rambla making it  the perfect location from which to explore Barcelona.  We stayed for two nights.  

The room was spotlessly clean and was generally well equipped.  The bathroom, again spotless, could do with a bit of rethinking in its design. The shower was very powerful (lovely!) and the screen did little to keep the water from the rest of the bathroom (not so great!). The only place to put toiletries was on the floor or the shelf under the sink. 

There was a room service menu consisting entirely of sushi, which we found a bit odd.  

There was a distinct lack of information in the room about WiFi codes, how to get a key for the safe, breakfast times, etc. Apparently there should have been a pack with this information but it was missing. When we tried to phone reception to find out some info, the phone wouldn’t work as it seemed not be charging, although plugged in. This stuff is frustrating and unfortunate but these things happen and on the whole we enjoyed the hotel.",4,2018,08,01
60,This must be the best hotel in Barcelona!,"Last weekend we stayed over in Hotel Oriente Atiram. First of all what a perfect location in the middle of the Ramblas. You are near the beautiful city centre for sightseeing on the one hand, and near the perfect beach at the other side. Furthermore the rooms where clean. There was a broad breakfast variety with a high quality. The hotel overall appearance is very good. 
One the second day my friend got in an accident and he hurt his foot really bad. I never in my life visited an hotel with such helpful staff. They offered help with honestly everything, even during the night. They acted with hospitality but also with humanity. Next time I’m in Barcelona there is only one hotel I will stay, Hotel Oriente Atiram!
I studied International Hospitality Management in the Netherlands but these guys are an example how it’s done!",5,2018,08,01
60,Wonderful place to stay!,"Very pleased with my room - the delux twin/double room. It had a free mini fridge that was restocked daily, and tea and coffee facilities. The balcony opened out onto La Ramblas. I slept very well. The room was very comfortable and clean. The staff were friendly. The breakfast was an extra 12 euro per day, but that is optional. Excellent location, really made my trip! :)",5,2018,07,31
60," Noisy but good location ","The location was excellent and the rooms are clean

But the hotel has the worst sound proving ever that every sound could be heard in the next room , so if you don't want to sleep and want to be disturbed 24/7 you'll enjoy it",2,2018,07,30
60,"Nice hotel, friendly staff",We had a nice time there with our 2 children. It was nice to be right on Las Ramblas...we could walk to everything. Many restaurants and shops right outside of the hotel. Two double beds easily accommodated our family.,5,2018,07,23
60,Great Hotel in the Heart of the City,"My nephew and I recently spent 4 days at the Oriente and it was an amazing experience.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially Manu and he guided us in our questions and interests.  Our room was great with a balcony overlooking La Rambla. I would definitely stay here again.  Thank you Manu and all.",5,2018,07,23
60,Great location ,"Perfect location if you are using public transportation.  
Rooms are clean. 
Breakfast is fair, although it is almost the same every day.  
Personal at the reception is very kind and helpful.  
I would repeat it ",5,2018,07,19
60,Not high end but a good value and the best location!,"When you mention Barcelona nearly everyone says ""LA RAMBLA!!""  Well, here you're right on La Rambla.. walking distance to so many attractions and the action.  Not the most comfortable bed but for the value we got for our money I recommend this hotel with no more than a 3 night stay!",5,2018,07,19
60,Outdtanding customer service,"We stayed at the Oriete Atiram for 2 nights before flying back to Australia. The stay was made particularly enjoyable by the quality of service provided by their staff, particularly on the reception. 

The hotel is right on La Ramblas so is in an ideal location to soak up the atmosphere and buzz of Barcelona. We had a room on the first floor at the front on a Saturday night. It was noisy but the staff were very happy to provide us with a room at the rear on a higher level. We should have asked for this in the first place.

It is a charming older style hotel and, as to be expected for a city hotel, the rooms are quite small. It has a very nice and airy breakfast room with a well priced and well supplied buffet service. Again the staff were great. They allowed me to work on my laptop in the restaurant long after it closed.

Even when we left the reception staff were very good, despite being very busy, with storing luggage and arranging a cab to the airport. We were really impressed with the quality of service at the hotel. It was as good if not better than the 4 and 5 star hotels we had stayed in during our trip.",4,2018,07,18
60,A good experience,"Convenient location, modest hotel.  Hotel staff most accommodating, personable, knowledgeable and fun.  Air conditioned with varied, nutritional and substantial continental breakfast.  Guest computer helpful.  Can be very noisy.  If factor, they do have room facing inside courtyard-like area that are quiet.  I'd go back in a flash!",5,2018,07,15
60,Great location,"It's right on La Rambla, minutes away from the Gothic Quarter and the metro. Friendly and helpful staff. I'm giving them 4 out of 5 because of the beds. The mattresses were really old and you can feel the metal springs.",4,2018,07,15
60,Perfect!,"Stayed at this hotel 9th - 13th April and would definitely go again.
Housekeeping kept our room, and the rest of the hotel, spotless. 
Reception staff were very helpful, calling the tour bus for us when my husband lost his glasses, and ensuring we knew which side of the metro station to go to. 
I cannot comment on the food as we were room only and ate at the many restaurants Barcelona has to offer. 
The best part of the hotel is the location.  Absolutely perfect for wherever you want to be.  We upgraded to a city view room and were not disappointed.  Waking up everyday looking out on Las Ramblas was wonderful.",5,2018,07,14
60,Fantastic hotel with wonderful staff,"We couldn't have picked a better hotel for our visit to Barcelona. Right in the middle of La Ramblas  in the Gothic part of the city it is classed as a 3* hotel but is so much more. We stayed for five nights in a deluxe room it overlooked the busy street. The doors to the balcony were soundproof so you had a choice whether to listen to the hustle and bustle or close them. Air conditioning was great when returning from the beach and our room had a mini bar/fridge with free water and soft drinks provided throughout our stay. The room was cleaned daily and  towel changed. The bathroom, although dated was perfectly fine and water pressure  was great. The staff at this hotel are what makes it special. Every morning we were greeted with smiles in the breakfast room. The continental breakfast is fresh and plentiful with hot food also availabe. It made a change to have pastries, fresh fruit , cheeses and cold meats. The reception staff are very efficient. Check in took around 10 minutes and we were provided with a map of the city and given lots of information. Travelling on the metro is great and again, the staff gave us instructions on the best way to get around. I would recommend the  hotel to friends and family and will definitely go back and stay there again.",5,2018,07,14
60,A step above a hostel (barely),"we reserved 2 rooms via a 3rd party booking agency- one room was superior for 3 (2 adults and one child) and the other was a standard for 2 people. when we arrived late in the evening, I had to look at my reservation to confirm that I was in the right place as it looks nothing like the pictures. the Lobby reminds me of a hostel or train station with stained furniture, cologne dispenser and zero charm. I was told by the very nice gentleman at the desk that they didn't have the reservation as a triple superior and a standard but that they only had it for 2 standard. he was kind of enough to tell me that the next day we could move into another room and he wrote our name down in his notebook with the advice to get to the desk as early as possible to be moved. we loaded all of our luggage in to the elevator (there is no luggage trolley although they offered to help) and went to our rooms. the standard rooms have dingy, banged up furniture, peeling paint, pealing linoleum floors, scuffed walls, paper thin pillows, bare basic bathroom, stained drapes and a mini fridge that had to be 20+ years old. the next day we packed up and went downstairs only to be told that there were no rooms available and that our name was not on the list. after some discussion a superior room for 3 became available. this room, although better, is still not what I would classify as ""superior""- although it did have more space, less stains, a coffee maker and better pillows (when our other party asked for additional pillows, they were given more of the paper thin pillows). Both rooms were really noisy. 

the breakfast was plentiful and the breakfast staff was nice enough. the cleaning staff also seemed nice enough. the elevator technician, who was always there as the elevators broke down frequently, was also very nice.  While we were there, we witnessed several other groups adding their name to the magical notebook of upgrades. we also witnessed 2 travelers check out early and very disgruntled. 

Pros- breakfast, nice breakfast room, location right on the Ramblas 
Cons- noise from outside, noise from inside, noise from the other guests sitting in the hallways chatting and drinking, pillows, elevators, rooms, decor

The hotel looks like it may have had better days and that it could possibly return to those days, but we unfortunately won't be choosing it again.",2,2018,07,11
60,Excellent in every way ,"We are staying here for four nights. Our check in was smooth though we had to wait for about 10 minutes but that's OK as this is a very busy hotel located in the middle of the famous and happening La Rambla street of Barcelona! (This is the main attraction of this hotel) This is in an old remodeled building may be dating somewhere in the 19th century. I had booked City View room and the reception initially allotted a room that was on the fourth floor #446. The room was small and AC was not cooling satisfactorily. after complaining they sent a technician but it was of no use. We managed to spend two nights here but didn't sleep at all. After requesting at the reception on the third day of our stay they changed our room on the second floor # 203 which was much spacious and with proper cooling AC. My sincere thanks to them. Breakfast was good and the reception staff  were very helpful specially FATOU, PABLO and Louis. ",5,2018,07,11
60,Best location,"It is a 3 star hotel but it sure feels like more. Right on the main street of las ramblas. Love this hotel so much! 

You also have the best plaza real right across the street where the best food is and also where everything happens at night :) ",5,2018,07,10
60,Fantastic location!,"I stayed at the Oriente Atiram for 3 nights whilst visiting Barcelona. The hotel is situated about half way down Las Ramblas, approximately a 10 minute walk from Plaça catalunya. The room was a perfect size, with a very comfortable bed and a very clean, modern bathroom. The reception staff were very approachable, and were able to give excellent advice about the surrounding area. The hotel was extremely clean and tidy, and the housekeepers were very friendly and welcoming. The hotel is in a fantastic location, with restaurants, bars, market and shops located on Las Ramblas. The nearest underground station is Liceu, which is around a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Overall, a fantastic hotel in a fantastic location. Would definitely return! ",5,2018,07,10
60,Lots of noise,"We have booked for the 4 nights the location is good and also the stuff but the problem is there is lots of noises around the rood they have giving to us . It was just like a place without any walls , epecially in the morning . It really makes me crazy and unable to rest. ",3,2018,07,10
60,Great Central Location ,"Central location for everything. Friendly and helpful staff. Room was great. Breakfast was worth it.
Read an earlier review about having a small room so I had to opted for a deluxe room which is spacious. 
Got a 2nd floor balcony room facing La Rambla and noise wasn’t  an issue for me. 
I would stay there again.",5,2018,07,09
60,great,"my Family and I had a really great time in Barcelona. Finding a good hotel in Europe for a fair price can be challenging and we were happy to have found this hotel. our room's size was good, breakfast was good and the staff was really friendly and helpful. Great location!!! ",5,2018,07,07
60,A good hotel in a great location,"Having stayed at this hotel eight years ago, we recommended it to friends who were organising a conference. Although the hotel seemed to have changed ownership since we were last there, we were not to be disappointed. Being on La Ramblas, probably the most popular street in Barcelona, the location is perfect. Liceu metro station is just a couple of minutes’ walk away. The price of rooms is competitive for hotels in this city and we were able to take advantage of a special conference rate, which included breakfast, for the ten days we were there. Our room was clean and well looked after by the staff, who were friendly and polite. Breakfast was fine, with a fairly good selection of hot and cold food. Having enjoyed a pleasant time at the Oriente Atiram Hotel, we would most certainly stay here again next time we are Barcelona.",4,2018,07,04
60,Perfect Spot on the RAMBLA!,"Our family of 4 slept comfortably in this Hotel!  The room had a spacious bathroom, 2 twin beds pushed together for the adults (common for euro hotels) and then a pullout double bed for the kids.  Front desk staff was VERY friendly and helpful, even had us participate in their World Cup contest:)  Located right on the Rambla super close to the gorgeous Gothic neighborhood and the beautiful Plaza Real!  Breakfast was delicious!",5,2018,06,27
60,Central location,"A quaint hotel in a busy location right on la rambla with everything nearby. Surprisingly quiet even though my room was facing the street. The rooms are a bit basic, but comfortable enough. Staff is friendly and breakfast is OK.",4,2018,06,27
60,Don’t recommend ,"Below average hotel, starting from giving me a triple room instead of a family room (with the cost of family room) , no minibar in the room 
Beds are not comfortable at all, and their wheels are loose so the bed is moving from its place frequently with any gesture , AC is almost not working, breakfast is very poor , staff is not friendly at all , you can’t even find a clean cup to drink coffee easily during ur breakfast 

",1,2018,06,27
60,Staff went above and beyond for disabled person,"During our brief stay in Barcelona, the staff of Oriente Atiram went above and beyond to help my friend after she tripped and broke her foot on Saturday, June 16. After the taxi took us from the clinic to our hotel, my friend had difficulty getting around in crutches. Although it was not required of hotel staff to provide a wheelchair or to push someone around in one, the concierge named Louis went over and above. He found an office chair to use as a wheelchair, and pushed my friend from the taxi to the elevator, then  down a long hallway to her room on the 3rd floor. (I could not push her due to back problems). Louis never complained, nor did he ever say  it was not his job-which it was not. The next morning, Sunday, a man named Tommy went above and beyond, too. After we paid for the hotel breakfast, he let me choose food for my diabetic friend, then he carried it up the elevator and to her room. He offered; I did not ask. Later that morning, a concierge named Javier pushed my friend on the office chair from her room, down the elevator and to the taxi that took us to the airport. Their amazing help eased the stress of having to change our flights and head back to the States only 3 days into our 14 day trip to Europe. I'd like to add that the citizens and police were very kind and helpful when they saw my friend lying on the sidewalk in extreme pain after her fall. (The ambulance driver said a lot of people trip and fall on Las Ramblas, for the record.) The people at the clinic were also very helpful. Barcelona is a very friendly city!",5,2018,06,26
60,Life savers! ,"My husband and I came to Barcelona as a part of our honeymoon and after a disaster start (booking and air BnB which looked nothing like the photos and was dirty) the staff at Oriente were more than accommodating. The room  was tidy, bathroom big enough and awesome shower pressure! The awesome location means it can be loud at night but that didn’t bother us too much as we are pretty heavy sleepers. Would definitely stay here again! ",4,2018,06,21
60,Great location is the only plus.,"My wife and I stayed here at the end of our most recent European journey. As the title mentions, the location of the hotel is absolutely great. It is right by the Liceu L3 Metro line which can get you just about anywhere of note in Barcelona. This is the main draw of the hotel. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel as it cost $12 per person and you can definitely eat cheaper/better for the money at Boqueria or elsewhere. 

The hotel itself is really no frills. Our room was an okay size, it was not big, not small. There wasn't a mini-bar or fridge which I found odd because it was the only hotel on our trip that didn't have one. The bed was rock hard and was on an old wooden bed frame that creaked and cracked every time you moved. So when my wife would turnover, the bed would make a loud creaking noise and wake me up and vice-versa. This was not the only noise however. The walls are paper thin. You can hear absolutely everything going on in the rooms around you. For example, the room next door, you could hear them going to the bathroom. People in the hall talking, sounded like they were in your room. There was a room across the hall and two doors who were listening to loud music at all hours of the night, it sounded like they were right outside the door. I did call the front desk about this and they took care of it pretty quickly, which was very much appreciated. The doors of all the rooms slam shut, so during all hours of the day and night, you will be disturbed by slamming doors. We did not get much restful sleep during our stay in Barcelona. When I booked the hotel, I noticed that ""soundproof rooms"" was one of the listed amenities on Booking.com, so the noise level was extra surprising and disappointing. 
The bathroom was fine with the exception of the shower. It was absolutely impossible to take a shower without getting the entire bathroom floor soaking wet.

I personally would not stay at this hotel again. If you are not concerned about getting a good nights sleep and are looking for a place with a great location and helpful staff then this hotel will be fine for you. However, if you need a quiet place to rest your mind and body at the end of a long day of exploring the wonderful city of Barcelona, I recommend you go elsewhere.",3,2018,06,18
60,Great Location,"Reception staff very friendly and helpful offering great advise on where to eat. On arrival I requested and paid for early check in, but only 1 room of the three available, the following week after our cruise again no rooms available for early check in. To compensate this the reception staff kindly upgraded our rooms to superior over looking las Ramblas. The rooms was large our room had 2 balconies on the second floor, it was quite noisy but when the doors was closed you didn't hear the street noise. Overall the hotel was very clean, and staff was friendly. If I went to Barcelona again I would stay in this hotel.",4,2018,06,17
60,Excellent friendly hotel,It’s the staff who make this hotel so special. We spent two weeks here and had a fantastic time. Always clean and surprisingly quiet considering the location. We will be back to stay here so cheers guys and thank you!,5,2018,06,17
60,"Great location, ok hotel","You can’t beat the location. Even I had a rental car, it wasn’t complicated to park nearby for 20 euros a night.
But hotel itself is very simple. Room size was ok. I had no windows in my room. No coffee maker or cattle. No coffee in the hotel at all. Gap under shower door make the floor wet every time. 
Room was clean every day. Safe box didn’t work, I asked to fix it twice with no results.
Breakfast is simple but enough.
Bottom line, I would come again because of location, but only if I can’t find better alternative in the area.",3,2018,06,17
60,Fab hotel,"Just returned from a 2 night stay. I work in the travel industry so book hotels everyday all over the world. This hotel could not be better for a central stay in Barcelona, right on Las Ramblas, clean and rooms modern considering the hotel was built in the 1800's and great views of the Ramblas. I can highly recommend and will be selling it with no hesitation on my return to work.  The breakfast is 12 euros and lots of hot and cold buffet available. The staff are friendly and can't do enough for you.  Well worth a visit.",5,2018,06,16
60,Excellent hotel,Had a brilliant time at the Oriente Atiram. The hotel is very clean and tidy and the staff are very friendly. The room was pleasant and even though we were on las Rambla it wasn’t overly noisy. Definitely worth a visit.,4,2018,06,15
60,Great room with a balcony on Ramblas.,"Very friendly staff, great service, very decent free breakfast and wifi,   We ended up with a room with a small balcony overlooking Las Ramblas.  our original room was at the back of the hotel and there was renovations being done on the adjoining building so there was some noise.  the staff very obligingly moved us to the front room where we stayed for a week.  Whenever we return to |\Barcelona, we will stay at this hotel and we will book a room overlooking Ramblas.",5,2018,06,13
60,Highly recommend,Right in the centre of the city! Would highly recommend staying at this hotel! Went to Barcelona for my birthday as a special suprise from the girlfriend and being central in the city was perfect as it meant I wasn’t constantly walking miles to get to where I wanted to be! ,4,2018,06,12
60,Great Location and Service,"The hotel was in a great location, at the heart of Las Ramblas.  The rooms were clean and spacious and the service was great. The bathrooms were private and clean. We would definitely stay there again.",5,2018,06,09
60,Amazing ,"We arrived at the hotel in January and it was simply amazing, the service, the staff of the hotel, the breakfast, the rooms were well equipped. The next time we'll be in Barcelona for sure we're going back to this hotel. Highly recommend.",5,2018,06,09
60,Lovely staff and a hotel right in the heart of things.,"This is the second time I have stayed in this lovely historic hotel.It's disabled friendly, which I am and the staff are very helpful and welcoming. Several staff members even remembered me from last year which I found to be endearing.
Location, location, location! This hotel couldn't be closer to everything you need to see, especially The Gothic Quarter, which is my personal favourite part of Barcelona. The staff are very good directions and I never got lost under their advisement!

This is a hotel I could stay time and time again and still be very happy.",5,2018,06,09
60,Good value and great location.,"The hotel has an excellent location right in the heart of the old town and is ideal for visiting tourist attractions. The metro stop is very close by and it is a 10 minute walk down to the sea. There is some noise from the bars and restaurants and from the rooms nearby, so choose a different location if this would annoy you.
The rooms are basic, but ours was clean and we had what we needed for a short city break. Some people have complained on here about the rooms, but I found that smarter hotels in this location were double what we paid so I feel we had what we paid for. 
The breakfast room was lovely and there was a good choice of breads, cakes, cold meats and cheese as well as cereals and hot options. I think you'd be super fussy to not enjoy the breakfast.
We took a taxi to the hotel for 42 euro but for 6 euros each, we could have got the bus from the square up the road that stops at the top of Las Ramblas. It's a 20 minute walk at most. We did this going home and the airport bus goes every few minutes. The hotel is easy to find being just a few steps down from the opera house.
When choosing restaurants, be sure to check them out on trip advisor. There's a tapas bar just down from the hotel which is truly awful. Equally there are some very good ones. You can't tell from the outside.
Overall, I would stay here again as I loved the location. ",4,2018,06,09
60,Historic gem in the heart of it all,"Traveling as a family of four adults, we were hard pressed to find single rooms that could accommodate us all without a cot.  Luckily we found the Atiram Oriente, and were delighted by its convenient location on Las Ramblas.  The front desk was cheerfully manned 24/7 and housekeeping was good.  The elevators are tiny, as expected for an older building such as this.  Breakfast was available at additional charge (we did not partake) and was served in a lovely sunroom on level 1.  Two metro stops flank the hotel on the L3 Green line (Liceu and Drassanes) and it is literally across the street from the charming Barri Gòtic neighborhood.  It is an easy walk to the waterfront as well, with the Maremagnum shopping mall and beaches.  We will definitely try to stay here on future visits.",5,2018,06,07
60,Great location,"It is perfect location hotel if you want to be in the centre of the city, to visit old town or to be by the see. It was clean, comfortable and the staff very polite and helpful. I would like to chose this hotel during my next visit to Barcelona",5,2018,06,05
60,Great location,"This hotel is located midway on Las Ramblas and is ""walking close"" to many restaurants and sights.  Our room was clean and comfortable with the exception that the air conditioning hadn't yet been ""turned on"" for the summer season so it was a bit warm for our 2 nights there. The only other problem was that the beautiful black and white marble
floors were quite noisy when people came in late and their voices echoed up and down the hallways.  The staff at the front desk was very accommodating and helpful. Nice place",3,2018,06,04
60,Return Visit,"We’ve stayed here a few times over the past. The hotel is a old fashioned traditional hotel which is fantastically positioned on La Rambla, Barcelona. It’s very clean and smart, however a little dated in areas but adds to the charm. Really helpful staff, will return (again). ",4,2018,06,01
60,Satisfactory.,"The location of the property is top class. However, there are short comings such as no provision for tea/coffee in the room, no provision for ironing except for the laundry service which is not always the option of business travelers. The furniture in the room is barely adequate. No easy chair to relax on. the writing table was just passe. Not adequate literature on the hotel facilities. The hotel is not value for money. Except for the location I would not recommend this hotel to a friend. Further, due to the metro passing underneath the hotel, the vibrations and noise are apparent each time a train passes.",3,2018,05,31
60,Barcelona’s hotel,The hotel picture is very deceiving. It is a very basic hotel. Room was very outdated and basic. This hotel was comparable to Hotel 6 or not even as good as that.  This survey is not allowing me to rate the,2,2018,05,28
60,"Great Hotel, perfect location","Booked for a 3 night stay before our cruise, with our 5 yr old daughter. We loved it. Perfect location on La Rambla. All staff were very helpful. Lovely welcome touches in the room. Daniel was very kind and helpful. Advising us of how best to book tickets and how to get to certain restaurants when we had no idea where we were going. Extra pillows were no problem. Such a lovely friendly place to stay. Highly recommended. ",4,2018,05,25
60,Nice hotel!,"The staff are friendly and helpful and the breakfast had a good selection. The only issue is the location. 

As the hotel is located on La Rambla it does get very noisy in the evenings. Our room was located on the side street next to La Rambla and on the first night we were unable to sleep because it was so noisy (this might be because it was a Saturday night). The walls are also very thin, but were very lucky that we had quiet neighbours!

It was only the first night that we had issues with the noise and for the rest of the stay it was fine. The room was very clean and it was spacious enough for three adults. We also had a balcony which was nice.

I would recommend the hotel for a short break.",4,2018,05,24
60,We had a wonderful stay!,Everyone was very helpful and friendly and had good tips on restaurants. The bed was comfy and everything was very clean. Breakfast was ok - great rolls and yummy cheese and fruit. Would totally stay again - soon I hope!,5,2018,05,19
60,Really recommended / Wonderful experience ,"I’ve had the chance to spend a week in this hotel, and I truly had a wonderful experience. What separates this hotel from many others I’ve stayed in the past, is the fact that it has an overall warmth to it and a personal environment. I personally loved the personal touches in the room. The staff, the front desk and restaurant folks were all very accommodating and a pleasure to interact with. Hotel is in fantastic condition and breakfast was very good as well. 

I’m very happy to recommend this place to people visiting Barcelona and I’ll certainly be back to stay here in the future. ",5,2018,05,18
60,Just perfect,"My wife and I had a great stay in this hotel.Perfect location,nice room but more than that a wonderful team at all levels: front office,housekeeping,breakfast team, techician (particular thanks to Pablo for opening the safety box).For sure we will come back.Thanks also for your charming attentions.I highly recommand.",5,2018,05,17
60,Loud but clean,"Location was great, rooms are super clean, walls are paper thin, bring ear plugs, yes they will relocate you if you have a loud neighbor but who wants to re-pack their luggage?  1 of the 2 elevators was broken for the entire 3 days.  Tried to plug in my clothes steamer using the US converter and it fried it, my husband tried to use his trimmer and it also fried it, power shuts down in the room (336).  All you can do is charge your phones.  Got there at 10am on Sunday, couldn’t check in til 2 but they will hold your luggage.  First guy Receptionist who helped us wasn’t friendly, very dry, the rest are good!  Taxi rate was $32 euros to the airport",3,2018,05,10
60,"Great location, friendly and efficient staff","We booked on Expedia a couple of months in advance hoping to get the best rate, but were surprised to find the rates were significantly lower at check in. The hotel regretted not being able to charge the reduced rate but graciously offered free breakfast to ease our pain.

We had a great stay, the amazing location in the most happening street in Barcelona surrounded by restaurants and near places of interest being a major factor apart from the staff.

Daniel at the front desk was particularly friendly and efficient, a great source of information and advice on virtually everything in Barcelona and nearby towns.",4,2018,05,07
60,Barcelona Stay,"First impressions of this Hotel was ok although not impressed with female receptionists not very helpful allocated room 214 on 2nd floor room not as expected as it appeared to be a disabled room and neither my husband or myself are disabled didn't expect a room with a view and didn't get one. Asked about upgrading but again female receptionist not helpful and we decided that as we where only here for 3 nights we would just leave it, however that night my husband decided to have a shower before going to bed ,bathroom was a wet room when he showered it turned the bedroom into a wet room to and it then took me about 45mins to try and dry the bedroom floor and bathroom floor with all the towels that had been provided, as we had been up from 3.00am that morning i was not at all pleased tried to call reception only to find the phone did not work we decided to leave it till the morning although i didn't sleep well thinking i would be unable to shower for the next 4 days, however after getting up in the morning and going down to reception and speaking to a very nice gentleman at reception explained what had happened and that we would be unwilling to stay in that room as A we were not disabled  B the flooding that we experienced and C even if we were disabled it was a health and safety hazard , my husband also advised him that it could not have been the first time it had happened as the door frame from bathroom to bedroom was damaged as was the bedroom floor, the receptionist agreed to change our room although he couldn't gaurantee a room with a view , on inspecting the room which was 412 on the 4th floor it did have a view of Las Ramblas and was an excellent room and we were able to enjoy our Barcelona break . Unfortunately we didn't catch the receptionist name but he certainly did his job extremely well and turned this review from very bad to a good review and we are extremely grateful to him for his help.What I would say is and it is not anything against the hotel it should be made known that hotels on Las Ramblas cannot be accessed by transfer to front of hotel and they should be truthful when advising how far it is from drop off point to hotel we were told by Form2 bus transfer company that it was 50 metres when in fact it was more like 500 metres no problem to us but might be a problem to less able bodies",4,2018,05,02
60,Centrally located off La Ramblas,"Stayed at this property for 1 night before relocating to another hotel in the Gothic Quarter for the remainder of our stay. The Oriente Atiram is a nice property with a great location off La Ramblas, very convenient to much of what Barcelona has to offer. The exterior of the hotel is very nice, the room itself was good and were lucky enough to get a room with a teak verandah overlooking the activity of La Ramblas. Very nice to receive the welcome note in the room upon arrival, an excellent touch.
The only negative is the bathroom which is in need of refurbishing as it is very basic and something I would expect from a motel 6.",4,2018,05,01
60,Top location and very friendly staff,"The best thing about the hotel is is very helpful and friendly staff and its top location in Ramblas, close to Metro and top locations - Plaza de Catalunya, Columbus Statue, Cathedral and Marina, and plenty of eating places.

The staff were very friendly and went out of the way to help whenever needed.

The room was however,  rather small for the price excluding breakfast. There was also no tea/coffee making facility or a small fridge in the room. 

Overall we had a good stay.
",4,2018,05,01
60,Wonderful stay!,"When we first cheked in we received a room with a noises of building and driling. The moment i complained, i received a quiet room in the other side of the building. Thank you very much! It was very very good stay!",5,2018,05,01
60,Too expensive even for a toplocation,"The staff is very friendly and helpfull and loaction is top. However we changed room, which was rather small (only 1 chair + double bed although single beds were asked, but hotel was full due to congres) after 3 nights due to noise (Rambla side) and uncomfortable beds (impossible to sleep at all).The breakfast, 24 euros per couple per night, is far too expensive for the quality offered. The new room was bigger but you could easily follow the conversations in the room next door and a lot of corridor noise, especially in first room which was opposite breakfast location.No airco for first 5 days and hence hot in the room, even for april.It is indeed a city hotel but the basic comfort is missing for a rather expensive hotel (162 euro per night excl breakfast !!).",3,2018,04,28
60,Great stay,"I stayed here for 4 nights with my mum.
Great location, central, close to metro and great places to eat.
Hotel is really clean, beds comfy, hot shower with good water flow. Friendly staff, very helpful and check you in quickly.
Our room was at the back so no street noise, walls are thin so you can hear corridor noise. That being said this is a city hotel so what do you expect?
Would recommend staying here, we really enjoyed it.",4,2018,04,28
60,Great Location,"I stayed at this hotel 3 nights on the front end of my trip and one night on the back end. The location can’t be beat. I knew before my arrival that the hotel would be pretty basic but the location makes you forget that. We stayed in the superior room with the balcony facing La Ramblas for the first 3 nights room 404. The customer service was good. The beds weren’t very comfortable and the one pillow per bed was very flat. The hallways get very noisy in the morning. On our last night we were in a standard room (428). This room was a little bigger than a closet. It was Also extremely HOT! Even without the heat being on. We couldn’t get comfortable. I did call to complain and they gave me instructions for the thermostat over the phone instead of sending someone up. This didn’t work. When I checked out i told them again how terribly hot the room was. She responded “why didn’t you ask to switch rooms?” I explained to her that it was late at night plus i had already overheard them deny another guest a room change. Same hard bed and flat pillow. I could hear my next door neighbors talking when I was trying to sleep. I asked for a later check out of just ONE hour. And i was declined twice. Mind you on my first stay I checked out super early at 5:30am. So I thought it should Be no problem for me to stay an additional hour. But nope they were not accommodating at all. Although the location is good, I will check out what other hotels Barcelona has to offer next time.",3,2018,04,22
60,excellent location,"Stayed here for 5 nights in April in twin room with my son. Would definitely recommend this hotel. Hotel staff extremely helpful and friendly. Room very clean and comfortable. Able to take taxi from airport straight to hotel door. Perfect location for exploring the city on foot (though Liceu metro very near too). Our room faced the courtyard, so very quiet. Breakfast choices very good and well managed dining room. Felt relaxed and welcome at this hotel, like a home from home from the moment we arrived.",5,2018,04,18
60,A two day [room and breakfast] visit to sample Barcelona with teenage daughter and teenage son.,"Room. immaculate ,clean and efficient room maid service. A real Centre of a city location and feel.Taxi to and from the door. Step out the front door and one is in the heart of the city's life. Straight out into the Ramblas. For those who want to sleep with an open window and have no noise this is probably not their bag.
Friendly, helpful welcoming staff. Excellent breakfast variety and efficiently managed dining room.
A foyer and public areas which did not feel anonymous or ubiquitous as so many tourist destination modern hotels feel.",5,2018,04,17
60,Great location,"The location is impeccable right in the heart of the Barcelona. The hotel looks inviting from outside and also look good inside.
Our room is a bit small, it's a twin room (it seems most hotels use smaller room as twin room). The room was cosy and the facilities were good. Most time were quiet until one night someone somewhere inside the building decided to chatting loudly mid of night.
Most of the staff were friendly and helpful. I would recommend it.",4,2018,04,16
60,Fantastic location!,We really enjoyed staying here for 3 nights.  The room was comfortable and clean and the location was perfect in our view for a great stay in Barcelona.  We have been traveling for over 40 years and we would recommend this hotel.,5,2018,04,14
60,Perfect location,"Only stayed one night, would happily stay for longer.  Good sized room (not on the front).  Fabulous shower with lots of hot water.  Good sized towels.  Very close to Liceu Metro which makes getting right into the middle of Las Ramblas extremely easy.  The breakfast (you get breakfast for free if you book throught the internet) was varied and we would have looked forward to it again had we stayed a second night.  There is also a safe in the room which is a bonus in Barcelona. Highly recommend staying here for the comfort, the quiet, the location and friendliness of all the hotel staff.",4,2018,04,14
60,Perfect Central Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel during our 4 days stay in Barcelona.  The hotel was perfectly located to be able to access anything in the city.  Located right on Las Ramblas, the hotel is steps from one of the major streets in Barcelona.  It is just a few minutes’ walk to the subway and the Aerobus for transportation to/from the airport as well as two stops on the hop-on/hop-off buses for site seeing.  Everything in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona is an easy walk from the hotel.  The staff was always very helpful and nice during our stay.  My son (who is 6) was excited every time he got to interact with them.    We ate the buffet breakfast most mornings and we found it better than the typical European breakfast buffet.  They had a selection of eggs, bacon and sausage as well as a cold meats and cheeses.  They also had a large selection of different breads (rolls, chocolate filled ""donuts"", croissants, etc.).  Their breakfast was a great way to start the day and we never left hungry.  Finally, we stayed in a triple room with three twin beds.  The room and bathroom were very large and had a small balcony off the side street perpendicular to Las Ramblas.  We found the room to be very clean.  The one issue we had was that we stayed there before the hotel switched over from ""winter season"" to ""summer season"".  As such, the hotel didn't have cool air conditioning and the HVAC was only set for heat only.  The first night we didn't realize this and thought we had turned the air conditioning on because the room was hot and stuffy, only to later find out that the room was only getting hotter.  Opening the balcony door cooled off the room, however, being close to Las Ramblas, the street noise was VERY loud with the door open.  We learned to open the door a couple hours before bed to cool off the room which kept the room  comfortable overnight.  This is an old/historic hotel, so the walls are thin and the few outlets in the room were already in use.  With all that said, we wouldn't hesitate to stay in this hotel again.  After we figured out the HVAC (the hard way), everything was better than we could have hoped.",5,2018,04,08
60,1st time to Barcelona,"Stayed her from 19th - 22nd March, had a room overlooking Las Ramblas (446).
Lovely spacious room, beds comfortable, nice bathroom, very clean. Couldnt fault the hotel, staff very friendly, its in the ideal location, very central for everything. Would definately stay here again on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2018,04,02
60,A good 3 star,"We stayed here in a superior room overlooking Las Ramblas. The hotel staff a polite and helpful and our room was cleaned every day. As part of the deal for the superior room you get a complimentary mini bar. This consisted off 2 bam all bottles of coke, Fanta lemon, Fanta orange and 2 bottles of water. There was also a bag of crisps and a kit Kat. Anything eaten or drank was replaced daily. We had paid for breakfast but from previous reviews were not hopeful however it was very good. There was a small selection of bread( I loved the toaster) cakes, fruit, meats, cereals (including some gluten free) and 3 or 4 items of cooked things. 
A very pleasant stay and we would happily return. ",5,2018,03,31
60,Excellent location,"We stayed for 3 nights with our 7 year old daughter. I had booked a triple room and we were allocated room 121. Very spacious but needs renovating not much in the room besides 2 (large) single beds and a double sofa bed. Lacking in style but very clean and large bathroom with a great shower. It had an interconnecting door and paper thin walls which meant we could hear everything from next door. But not really a problem as I think they realised too so everyone in both rooms kept noise to a minimum! Breakfast was nice served in the impressive breakfast room. Cold meats, fresh fruit, English breakfast (Spanish style but very nice!)toast, cakes etc. Very good no complaints. Reception staff very helpful and courteous. (Nice touch with sweets and lollipops for the children). Location amazing and very grand exterior to the hotel. Obviously needs a bit of refurbishment in some areas but all in all a very nice hotel in a great location. ",4,2018,03,29
60,"Great location, clean hotel",This hotel is located steps from all of the action on Las Ramblas. We stayed here with our children and they had rooms that could accommodate 4 people. The hotel room was clean and comfortable and the staff was friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel. ,5,2018,03,29
60,Great hotel great location great staff,"Just back from our stay in Barcelona.
(Unfortunatley)? We had to stay an extra 3 nights,due to a strike by french air traffic control.
The staff, were exceptional, especially the reception.they helped us book and print our new return flight details.
On arrival our room overlooked la ramblas which is slightly noisy?
We requested a quieter room which they changed straight away.
We would highly recommend this hotel for friendly helpful and efficient staff,
And could not fault location.and the cleanliness.",5,2018,03,28
60,Staff are what make this hotel what it is,Just back from trip to Barcelona where we were due to spend 3 nights at this hotel but due to a flight cancellation spent 5 nights - thee hotel staff were Excellent 8n helping us sort out the extra nights and we're helpful in every way - room was quiet as we asked for room overlooking the inner area - breakfast was good - the location of the hotel  is a big plus being on La Rambla -overall our trip was great due to the excellent service we received at this hotel and it was very reasonable - if we go back to Barcelona we will stay at this hotel without doubt - ,5,2018,03,27
60,Very Enjoyable Stay,"We stayed in the Oriente from 18th-22nd March 2018 & enjoyed it immensely.  Pleasant, Friendly & Efficient Reception staff checked us in quickly.  Our room (409) was on the top floor with balcony looking over Las Ramblas, it was clean, bright,with all the amenities we had expected.  Breakfast was served in a beautiful ""pyramide"" central courtyard & was plentiful & varied.  All in all it was a very pleasant stay & we would stay again in the future & would recommend the Oriente to anyone.",4,2018,03,27
60,Enjoyable stay but very noisy room,"Excellent position on La Ramblas convenient for sightseeing, Metro, taxis & restaurants & bars. Very friendly and helpful reception staff but breakfast staff need improvement.
The first thing to remember is this isn't a modern built hotel - it dates back to 1843. Unfortunately it has had to conform to modern day health & safety which doesn't blend into the history of the building spoiling the aesthetics i.e. an aluminium wheelchair ramp immediately as you enter the hotel. Also where they have tried to section off office space by the lifts is a shambles. The corridors on the other floors have been modernised but still have areas where modern doors have been very badly fitted and just 'plonked' there.

Our room was a good size, the beds comfortable and well cleaned every day. They even arranged my PJ'S in different ways on the bed every day. The downside to the room was the noise! The window looked out onto a side street which was very noisy 24 hours a day. They emptied the bins between 2.30am - 3am, deliveries started about 5.30am and noisy revellers all through the night.
The walls are paper thin and there was a baby that cried constantly in the room next door. We had to buy earplugs!!!

Breakfast! We had bought a breakfast package so felt obliged to eat there. The continental breakfast seemed well catered for - selection of meats, sausages, cheeses, plenty of fresh prepared fruit etc. The 'English' style breakfast left a lot to be desired. The 'bacon' was fried processed ham dripping in fat and the baked beans & scrambled egg was always cold. Breakfast was served 7am - 11am. At 9am we asked for more 'bacon' as the tray was empty. We were told there was no more 'bacon' for that day. Fried eggs were served for 1 morning only. The staff were very slow in replenishing empty food trays and cups/glasses/plates etc and had to be asked  several times.
I would stay there again because of its position but would request room away from noisy street and not have breakfast.",3,2018,03,24
60,The staff makes the difference,"After a problem regarding the reservation we had with the travel agency, the staff offered us a Superior Room (#118) which was great and had everything we expected: good design, always clean sheets and towels, water boiler (key to us) and was very big.

Want to highlight the attentive staff of the hotel which were kind to offer us the upgrade of the room after the problems with the travel agency. Specifically Fatou and her manager.

Strongly recommend you to get the Superior Rooms as some of the basic rooms are to be renovated.",4,2018,03,22
60,Noisy room,You put us in a end room were which they new that building work was going on from7.30am until5 @6pm we were there thurs until sun they did say they don't work sat and sun and laughed very professional you won't see us again thank you,1,2018,03,21
60,Very good located hotel,An hotel very clean who has a very interesting proximity with the center of Barcelona.  la rambla side can be noisy so you can choose the other side. Service OK and the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.,5,2018,03,20
60,An ideally located hotel,"This hotel is located in the middle of La Rambla, near to the Metro stop ""Liceu"". Check-in is speedy and the staff are pleasant. The room my husband and I selected was one with a balcony overlooking La Rambla and we were not disappointed. The view, especially at night was beautiful. The room was equipped with a kettle, items to make coffee and tea, as well as a mini-fridge. The bathroom was small but fully equipped and the room was cleaned daily. The only thing I disliked was the beds...they were a bit uncomfortable as the mattresses were a tad thin.",4,2018,03,15
60,Neat and convenient place,"The hotel is old, but very well maintained and is clean. What makes the stay great is the service and courtesy of the staff, from the reception to the room cleaning staff, they always have a smile and help you a lot. Great service. Location is impeccable.",4,2018,03,12
60,Good location,This hotel was clean and very centrally located. If you choose la rambla side it can be noisy so if you want quiet choose the other side. The beds are not the comfiest but clean and good maid service.,5,2018,03,11
60,Average,"Location is pretty good if you like the tourist areas. Plenty of places to eat close by. Staff are very friendly and helpful.
The room was a bit dated and basic, but spacious.
Unfortunately I had a family in the room next to me who didn’t care about how much noise they made, or for how long.
Hardly slept!
Not the hotels fault, but it was irritating.

Taxis are easy to flag down outside the main door.
For info. I paid 30 Euro from airport to hotel.
Hotel back to airport 25 Euro.",3,2018,03,07
60,"Great location, Hotel leaves much to be desired","We went during the same time as the Mobile World Congress. It was the cheapest hotel we could find on La Rambla (which was still pretty pricey). Location was important for us and it definitely is in a convenient location.

They gave us a room that has not been renovated.  2 twin beds pushed together, washroom small that you cannot open the door all the way, furniture and decor are old school, bed was kind of springy, one pillow each - flat.  Our room faced into the alley way and it was loud  - renovation, paper-thin walls, animal sounds through the ventilation.  

We got used to it, but I think we would opt for a nicer hotel next time.  For our first visit it was great to be on La Rambla.

Another thing I found strange - no conditioner, only one bar of soap for the sink, toilet paper rough, No plugs/converters (bring your own) by the bed, safe didn't work properly, door locks were flimsy and you have to give your key to the desk everytime you leave (when you retrieve your key they don't do a security check), we had to prepay for the entire stay when we arrived.",3,2018,03,04
60,Excellent!,Enjoyed our stay at this hotel...great location and very friendly staff that was fantastic to help us with reserving tickets and directions !  Very clean and well kept!  Would stay at this property again !,5,2018,03,04
60,"Convenient, cheery location.","I'm giving it 5 stars not because its a 5 star hotel but because of service and location. Front desk persons were extremely helpful and kind. Room was always tidy after a long day out, and location was superb in the heart of Las Ramblas on edge of Gothic district. Super close to Liceau metro, easy walking distance to two other metro stations and much to see with out ever getting on metro. If you want view of street from balcony (which we did) you'll sacrifice some overnight quiet. You can hear the muffled sounds of partiers through till early morning hours, them the street sweepers and trash. Windows were good and muffled noise, but you could still hear street noise. Blackout curtains were wonderful. If you want quieter ask for room off the street. Two cafes next door are convenient. Matresses were utilitarian (European hostel type) but sufficient for our 4 night stay. Breakfast available in hotel, but we didn't choose to eat there.",5,2018,02,24
60,Amazing hotel and people,"Me and my partner stayed here for our first holiday together and we are defiantly coming back! Amazing hotel, staff and place! I can’t stress enough how fab this hotel is! We got a complementary mini fridge, bag, lollies, toiletries and a note on the mirror! We’re coming back in the summer! P.S the balcony view is amazing! Highly recommend!! ",5,2018,02,24
60,Fab Time,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in your hotel, hotel staff were friendly, breakfast was of a good standard with plenty of choice. We had a superior room which was of a good standard liked the free mini bar, nice touch.  ",4,2018,02,20
60,"Great little hotel, lovely breakfast, perfect location",My two teenage sons and I had a great stay at the Oriente. Couldn't have been a better location for us - a short walk to everything we wanted to see and do. Really nice breakfast and loads of it for hungry boys. Friendly too. Yes it was a little noisy between rooms but that didn't bother us. We'd definitely go back. Thank you!,5,2018,02,18
60,Quick trip with my hubby ,"Staff is friendly and will give you many tips on the city sites if you ask. Oriente is located on Las Ramblas street. The Metro, La Boqueria Market, Tableo Cordobés Flamenco, City metro, Hop On-Hop Off city tour buses are very close. Right in front of the hotel are many restaurants, on Saturdays and Sunday’s there are street vendors. It’s is a busy street, I am a light sleeper..we had a Balcony facing Las Ramblas and I still had good night sleep. Only complaint was the pillows- were too stiff. Rooms are very clean, there is a personal safe in the room. For the price, it’s a great hotel close to everything. Police located all around the area. Definitely will come back. ",4,2018,02,17
60,Not suggested,"The location is the only positive point of this hotel. We were a family with 4 members, the room was so small, there was not enough space for our luggages, the sofa bed was so uncomfortable. It was not clean enough. The room had no refrigerator and when we asked for one they said they can not provide any (although I had asked to have one before our visit through email). Walls are so thin you can hear everything from your neighbors’ room! Believe me, every details! The furnitures are so old. The TV was broken. The electricity was gone twice in our one week stay. I do not recommend this hotel.    ",2,2018,02,17
60,There are many problems at this hotel ,"Negative points:
1- this is very noisy, we could hear many sound when we wanted to sleep after 12 pm
2- there aren’t any facilitie that you need at a hotel specially with family. Like water warmer or god pillow and enough closet.

Positive point:
Location ",2,2018,02,16
60,Leisure ,This hotel was very friendly. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. Although it was rather cold during the night. Staff were very accommodating and gave us extra blankets. I would definitely stay here again ,4,2018,02,14
60,Perfect hotel for Birthday visit,"My fiancée booked us into thus stunning hotel for my Birthday after wanting to visit Barcelona for a long time and we were not disappointed with the hotel, its location, or the city.

This hotel is about as perfect as you can get to visit Barcelona, it sits smack bang on the middle of the las ramblas strip which is perfect for tourists who want to sight see.

All the main sights are a 15 minute walk to the left or right and the gothic quarter is just a 10 minute walk away. We done the camp nou stadium tour which wad also easy to get to in a taxi an the fair cost no more than 15€.

The room was lovely with a little balcony which over looks the ramblas strip. Despite being on of the noisiest snd busy streets in the world the windows keep all noise put so you can sleep easy when the city doesn’t. The hotel is a listed building which ads character to it and is tastefully decorated. The staff were lovely and extremely helpful, couldn’t fault them.

Its classed as a 3* hotel which we thought is a harsh rating, it should 100% be classed as a 4* but it feels like a 5*. The value for money is amazing and is the perfect hotel for any one looking to visit Barcelona

We are returning to Barcelona this year and we are 100% booking this hotel as it is faultless.

60,Location! Location! Location!,"Fantastic location . Old fashioned but in a nice way and very clean. Perfect for a city break as walking distance from the Catalan square where you can get walking tour and buses , near a metro station and hundred of bars and restaurants! ",5,2018,02,11
60,Great location,"Very good hotel, the location was excellent,  very friendly staff. Our only criticism is the breakfasts could have done with being a bit warmer. We were on the 4th floor overlooking Las Ramblas and it was fairly noisy but didn't spoil our stay. Would defiantly recommend.",4,2018,02,11
60,Clean hotel ,"I stayed here with my sister for 2 nights in a las ramblas deluxe room, we arrived early and were able to leave our luggage in a safe room with reception staff until after 2 o’clock when our room was ready which was great to be able to lighten the load when walking around this amazing city! When we finally did come back to go to our room we were delighted it was exactly what’s on the photos on TripAdvisor it was clean tidy and had all the essentials you need and a added bonus was a balcony looking out on to las ramblas this was fab for us as we enjoyed been able to feel and see the buzz while in the room. I would definitely stay here again! Thank you hotel oriente atiram for a wonderful stay with you! ",5,2018,02,10
60,Very Good Location and very Friendly Staff,"We stayed 3 nights in January 2018 in this hotel with our small dog and the room was very clean and there was a friendly message on the mirror in the bathroom which was a very nice touch.  Regrettably, there was some renovation work going on nearby which began on the Monday morning - I am sure that this is not a permanent issue.  The reception staff could not have been more friendly or helpful.  We had a room at the back of the hotel and this was very quiet on the Saturday night.  but regrettably the other two nights we had a family next door with children screaming all through the night which I reported to the staff on departure but of course this was not the fault of the hotel.  The location is very central and perfect for reaching everywhere in the city on foot.  I would stay there again but check that there is not a noisy family in the next room first.",4,2018,02,04
60,Central clean friendly,"Right o  the RAMBLA.....that means all the tourist stuff near by. 
Hotel staff very friemdly and helpfull. 
Rooms are clean and a bit larger than expected in europe . Sheats smell great.
2 adults and 2 children . .perfect fit.
Nearby eating ...recomend almost any place ...but the gaulle is quaint and the food great . Moderate price..paella for 17 euros...but exquisit. Calamari fresh .
Only down side for the rooms ....noizy. can hear your nextdoor neighbor clearly and as allways in a active area there is construcions  arround the hotel.
Would recomend.
Tip. Airport fees in taxi is arround 30-35 euros. And you can be dropped off directly at hotel. ",4,2018,02,02
60,Delightful hotel on rambla..,"Superb location. Excellent rates. Good food. Delightful, friendly staff. Well insisted from street noise. Great complimentary mini bar. Handy to restaurants, shops, bars, buses and tube. Architecture of building very interesting",5,2018,02,01
60,Great location and amazing breakfast!,"We loved the hotel. It was really confortable and the location was great. The breakfast is amazing with a lot of opcions. The service is really good and friendly, they help you with anything you need!",5,2018,01,29
60,Lovely,"We found the staff very helpful and patiently answered our questions as this was our first visit to Barcelona. Close to the La Boqueria Market, restaurants and the bus stop. Free buffet breakfast and a room with balcony overlooking La Ramblas, perfect. When we return to Barcelona we will definitely stay here again.",4,2018,01,26
60,"great location, clean hotel and good breakfast","I booked this hotel directly on their website which meant that breakfast was included in the price.

The hotel is in a great location on the Ramblas.  Our room was large, spotlessly clean, and good size.

THere was a good variety of food - including hot for breakfast.",5,2018,01,23
60,Great location,"Great hotel in the middle of La Ramblas, the reception staff very friendly and happy to help with any questions you may have.  Booked a La Rambla room and were disappointed there was no fridge in the room but when we spoke to reception they happily moved us.  The hotel is well kept and very clean.  Good breakfast and again lovely staff. Excellent WiFi.  If you are looking for a quiet location this is not the place for you as the noise from the street is very high.  We loved watching the world go by from the Juliet balcony.  I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.",5,2018,01,22
60,"Excellent staff and service, central location","We spent 7 nights at the Oriente Atiram, having booked a Ramblas Deluxe room in advance. The room we were given upon arrival, however, was not up to the mark. Manu at reception was exceptionally helpful: he moved us to a bigger and better room immediately, and left a detailed note for the Manager Elainie (sp.?), explaining what our online reservation had promised. After the first 2 nights, the Manager moved us to a Ramblas Deluxe room on the fourth floor, which was superior.

The room: far quieter; had two Juliet balconies looking out on to Las Ramblas; spacious (with a sofa); tea-and-coffee making facilities; and as with the first room, it had a minibar which they refilled for free every day.  
(Missing: Good reading lights. The light by each bedside was not powerful enough.) 

The bathroom: while clean, and of a good size, the bathroom needed a few more practical fittings like more hooks for hanging up things, or another shelf or two (in addition to the one below the sink).

Towels: the hotel changes guests' towels every day, which is energy inefficient. Might it follow the green policy? 'Towels left hanging or on the tub's edge will not be changed; towels left on the floor will be changed'.

Breakfast: For small-to-average eaters, this was slightly overpriced, at 12 euros per person, but certainly worth trying once (especially as it has a 'Catalan Corner' with special salamis etc.). They also have a gluten-free section. 
(The hotel has innumerable cafes and restaurants on its doorstep.)

Computer: There is a Guest Computer in the main lobby, which we used a few times. Staff at the reception were always happy to help.  

Location: Unbeatable. We were able to do almost all of our visits to the museums, galleries, the cathedrals, the Gothic Quarter, the former Jewish Quarter, Montjuic, Placa d'Espanya, Placa de Catalunya, and La Boqueria on foot. That said, its location is equally convenient for the metro and buses. The hotel is a few doors away from one of Europe's most famous opera houses, The Liceu.  

Times Past: The hotel bears a plaque commemorating a visit by Hans Christian Anderson (one among a few other famous guests). It also has a sign on the outside, from a previous era, announcing a 'Salon de Thé'. It would be wonderful if the hotel might, indeed, give over part of the lobby area to recreating an old-world Salon de Thé.",4,2018,01,20
60,"Location! Friendly, clean, responsive staff.","Our first trip to Barcelona, our--30th? 40th? hotel somewhere in Europe over the years. It is a solid 3 star hotel. We don't look for spacious and plush--we spend more time outside around and about. But we don't want to trip over each other or feel like the hotel is cutting corners on basics like cleanliness, attention to essentials. On Las Ramblas, an accessible, easy walk to all the Gotic and Raval sites.Metro station very near to get to the Gaudi sites, the Extension area, and Montjuic, as are places to eat, get coffee. The Lo Boquiera food market is on the same side of the street, five minutes up--3 or 4 blocks. You definitely step out of the hotel into a busy area. We were there late December--the heat in this older building was a bit higher than we like, but we're from the Northeast part of USA. The staff responded by bringing us a fan...and that made all the difference for our comfort. Ask for an extra pillow? No problem. They had one of the biggest breakfast rooms/areas I've come across, and although cost of breakfast did not come with the rate the serve yourself food was great. As we wandered around the city I'd notice other hotels; never saw the insides of course, but I never saw one located where I thought...gee, I wish we'd known about that location.",5,2018,01,20
60,Lovely clean hotel in a great location,"I booked this hotel for a short break with my husband, my only criteria for booking was that it had a central location and was reasonably priced and I'm so pleased that we stayed there. 

The reception staff were friendly and helpful, the room was spotlessly clean and the choice of breakfast was amazing and included full english breakfast.  The food was of a good quality and plenty of fruit was available. Well worth paying extra to include breakfast as this saved us a fortune on restaurant prices.

In terms of location it couldn't have been in a better place and there is a great choice of restaurants close by.

We will definitely choose the Ortiente Atiram next time we visit Barcelona.",5,2018,01,18
60,Perfect and a great place <3,Stayed here for 4 nights with a friend. We arrived in the middle of the night. The welcome was very warm. The hotel is excelent. The staff very friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and cleaned every day. The location of the hotel is great ... on Las Ramblas. Metro station just a few meters away. We ate breakfast in the hotel only once. It was very good and there was a rich selection.,5,2018,01,15
60,weekend break,"Ideally located at the bottom end of Los Ramblas the hotel sits in a prime spot allowing easy access to the vast amount of attractions that Barcelona has to offer. Rooms are adequate for the price you pay but nothing special. We never ate in the hotel due to the large number of restaurants and bars nearby. No tea and coffee making facilities in the room is not ideal in todays day and age meaning you have to go out for tea or coffee all the time, luckily there is a small coffee shop just over the road which was a life saver.",3,2018,01,12
60,Perfect for first time visitor and solo women travellers! ,"This visit was my first to Barcelona and, as a woman travelling solo, it was important to feel ""at home"" and to have a centrally located place to stay. I was very pleased: my modernist room was lovely, with plenty of storage space and a generously sized bathroom. Excellent Continental breakfast available, although if you're a light eater, you'll get a better deal in one of the many cafés on La Rambla. At my request I was put in an interior room, which was extremely quiet as I wanted. It was a pleasure to return to the room after long days of exploration. You should definitely consider the Oriente Atiram especially if you're new to Barcelona! ",4,2018,01,05
60,Tourist Hotel,"This hotel is located in the best place - central on Las Ramblas - walking distance to all the different areas and the bus station less than 400 metres.  Reception staff were helpful but booking in was a little slow (4 rooms) - it could be we had the newest member of staff.  We booked a deluxe Ramblas Room - supposedly one of the best rooms - it was dowdy and tired, the flooring needed replacing I felt the room was expensive for what it was €600+ for 3 nights- beds were very comfortable and linen clean and fresh. Unfortunately on our second day at 4.30 pm our beds had still not been made or the room cleaned.(our friends experienced the same) When I spoke to reception about this I was told they were a cleaner short! Our room was supposed to have soundproof windows but they weren't evident.  However it was wonderful to open the windows onto a Juliet balcony and be part of what was going on outside.Breakfast room was an atrium style, very light and airy and food more than adequate. Communal areas were dark and needed upgrading.   We have stayed at several hotels in the area with better facilities and prices, but this wasn't one of the best.",3,2018,01,03
60,"Great Service and Rooms, Las Ramblas Character","Hotel Oriente Atiram 

I stayed at the Hotel Oriente the second week of October, 2017.  I was a solo traveler and made a last minute decision to stay longer in Barcelona.  The Hotel  Oriente provided me with a comfortable and well-appointed room  with a super view of the famous tourist street Las Ramblas.  What a location!  The hotel is right at the start of the old Gothic Quarter, where the shopping and bars and culture are perfect for walking tours. Right outside the hotel front is an outdoor dining area with wonderful food and wine. The hotel has a dining room near the front as well. Both places served my favorite food, fish and chips, and it was excellent.   So many conveniences were located right there, including a movie theater at one end of Las Ramblas and the Placa de Catalunya at the other (where you get taxis, tourist buses, and transportation to and from the airport).  Hotel Oriente met and exceeded all my requirements. The staff were the most accommodating and friendly of all the places I stayed during this vacation.  Really, they were so helpful for everything.  I will make the Hotel Oriente my base of operations for any visit to Barcelona. ",5,2017,12,31
60,Good central hotel ,"Stayed here mid December for two nights. Booked a deluxe Ramblas room with a street view.
  The room was nice but quite basic, however the juliette balcony and views of the Ramblas were excellent. The room also came with free water, soft drinks and crisps in the fridge which were replenished daily. Also there was a kettle in the room with complimentary coffee and tea.
   Lovely friendly and helpful  staff on reception who were happy to answer any questions and give directions to anywhere we asked about. 
   Overall a really good stay in an area that was central to everything we wanted to visit. ",4,2017,12,28
60,Great hotel experience at the heart of Barcelona,"My wife and I went for a couple of days to Barcelona for Christmas and we stayed at the hotel Atiram Oriente in the center of Barcelona. Our hotel experience added greatly to our great experience in the city. The service at reception was very kind and helpful. As we got into our room there was a personalized greeting card wishing us a great stay and they had left a bag with typical barcelona goodies on it. That was a little detail that while unexpected made us feel very good. The room was very nice and the temperature could be easily adjusted to have a comfortable temperature while outside was quite cold. The breakfast buffet was quite fresh and diverse and the location, an interior atrium quite beautiful. We were super happy with our stay and super conveniently located on the Ramblas and close to the metro station. Highly recommended!",5,2017,12,26
60,Great location for a reasonable price ,"It's a great place to stay in the heart of the city. I booked it last minute at a very reasonable price .. pleasantly surprised by the location. Very close to restaurants, bars, shops.. you can literally walk to every place.. ",5,2017,12,25
60,"Excellent location, staff, amenities, cleanliness",It was the best choice  for many reasons such as excellent location (at the heart of la Rambla) and  hospitality.The staff were very helpful. That was very interesting for me that I faced a welcoming card in my room. I will be back there for my next trip to Barcelona.,5,2017,12,24
60,"Best Location,value for money","I am so glad that we chose this Hotel for our family vacation. it is simple nice clean hotel, not too fancy but has everything that you need.

We paid a bit extra to get the street facing room with balcony, its worth the money if you are not a private person and like the hustle bustle of the street late night.

Just 200 m from Metro station, about 500 from the water front, it is just the ideal location to stay, Gothic Quarter is walking distance , Shuttle bus to Airport in just 10 min walk away.
Staff is friendly, house keeping is good. DO not miss the breakfast.

Wi-fi speed was a bit slow.",4,2017,12,22
60,Not much to fault - great value for money!,"My husband and I have just returned from a weekend break in Barcelona and have to say what a pleasant surprise this hotel was. Ideal location on the heart of Las Ramblas, just a couple of minutes walk from the amazing La Boqueria food market and opposite the fab La Rambla square. Liceu metro station is right outside with great connections to the airport and all the main sites of Barcelona, so all you need is right on your doorstep! 

The hotel itself was fresh, clean and well presented. We had a room on the 4th floor with key card entry. The corridors were surprisingly modern and more than 3 star looking. The room, although quite small, was more then adequate with a comfortable bed, extra blankets and pillows and heating if needed. The bathroom was clean and a nice size.

The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel but we looked around the buffet breakfast and it looked good.

Overall, the value for money on this budget hotel is exceptional and would definitely recommend it!",5,2017,12,03
60,Charming hotel,"My first visit to Spain and Barcelona was amazing.As my sister has moved to Barcelona it was time for me to visit her (and my brother). My sister wanted to live with me at the hotel so I booked online a Rambla Deluxeroom and added a fruitbasket.
We stayed for three nights and it was great! Right on Las Rambla! You can see that the hotel is old, but it's full of charm. The staff, from reception to breakfast, was really serviceminded! ping.
The room: good size, clean, a little worn but really cosy, great small balcony, free minibar with softdrinks that was refilled every day, good temperature. BUT the room stinked of perfume when we arrived and we had to open and ventilate...not a little smell, but SMELL! Same thing second day when we came back in the afternoon from sightseeing. Is it a way to freschen up the room? Not good!
The bathroom: Fresh and clean! Towels changed every day. Quickly hot water. 
The breakfast: Had everything we needed....fruit, Nescafémachines, egg, sausages, juices, different kind of breads, etc etc.. Loved the paintings in the breakfastroom!! 
As I have to leave at 4 o'clock in the morning to the airport, they helped to arrange a taxi, my sister could stay and keep slee
Over all we had a great stay and I will book the same my next visit to Barcelona....but please do something about the smell of perfume.",4,2017,11,30
60,Wonderful Stay !!!!,Beautiful location! We have stayed for seven days. Clean and tidy rooms with a beautiful view. We had the breakfast included in the package which was great . Staff was very helpful and positive all the time.                                                                                                                                                                   ,5,2017,11,30
60,A really handy hotel,"Don't let first impressions count.  The reception area is a bit worn and drab but this hotel is 5 star when it comes to location.  Situated right in the middle of Las Ramblas and equispaced between two Metro stations makes this hotel a perfect base for exploring Barcelona.

Rooms are more than adequate if not luxurious but contains everything you need except coffee and tea making facilities in some rooms.  We were in 311, on the front face of the hotel overlooking Las Rambles, we honestly cannot say we heard much outside noise when balcony door was closed.  Air condition worked and hot water was plentiful.

Just a couple of pointers - whilst breakfast is buffet style and more than plentiful the hot food could be a bit tepid.

Secondly the rooms are not numbered in sequence.  Which is quirky but if you follow the signs outside the lifts and bear this fact in mind you WILL find your room.

Staff helpful, breakfast room airy and light.  But it is the location that will sell this hotel to any city explorer",4,2017,11,26
60,An ideal base for exploring central Barcelona.,"We wanted to spend a couple of days exploring this beautiful city, and this hotel was perfectly located for this. Not expensive, although breakfast was not included, and while the desk staff were very helpful, one did not feel overwhelmed. The room was very clean but we  felt that it would have benefited from permanent tea/coffee making facilities (we were dying for a cuppa when we arrived and were unpacking), a shower door to keep the bathroom floor dry, and a toilet brush (well, you never know when one may come in handy), but apart from that, no other complaints. Very comfortable beds. There was a good-sized safe with the key available for a deposit. We will probably stay there again when we next visit Barcelona.",4,2017,11,26
60,"Clean, comfortable and very central location","We arrived with some trepidation having read negative reviews on TA.
All I can say is that we are really enjoying our stay.
We are room 405 with a Rambler balcony. Yes there is some noise from outside but it is low with the double glazed doors closed and has not stopped our sleep. The room is clean, beds comfortable, linen changed every day. The room is not luxurious (but we did not pay for a luxury hotel) but is modern and well appointed. Bathroom is good and tea and coffee are provided.
The staff are very friendly, speak very good English and are helpful. We did not book breakfast as there are so so many places to eat in Barcelona.
All in all we are very happy with our stay and would return.
Enjoy Barcelona - it is a brilliant city with so much to offer.",5,2017,11,24
60,Family Alvarez,"Excelent, It is close from moust of the shops and the metro.I had a wonderful time here!  we enjoyed it very much! The hotel apartment was perfect accommodation for a stay in Barcelona.The apartment was extremely spacious and clean. It was only 5-10 min walk to get different places. There was a supermarket just 5-10 min away and also a bakery.Thanks for the beautiful memories.",5,2017,11,23
60,quick stopoff,"Hotel is in an excellent position in the center, hotel structure is a little dated but very pretty. Rooms are furnished OK and bed comfortable. One silly problem the douche need a door as it floods bathroom",4,2017,11,21
60,Awesome....,"This hotel is an old building but well maintain, is very nice and clean, well located in the middle of La Rambla, near all attractions, People is great, and breakfast was super....!! We will be back.....",5,2017,11,17
60,great hotel - friendly staff,"this is my second time at the hotel and for the second time, I am confident that this is a one really great affordable hotel to stay in. the location is superb, in the middle of La Rambla street and close to everything you need at a walking distance (coffee shops, restaurants, pubs, Laundry Cleaning...) , the rooms are clean and well furnished. the beds are clean and comfortable, the pillows are really good, the bathroom is good.

People at the reception are friendly, helpful and well mannered; they are ready to support you anytime you want with a big smile.",5,2017,11,17
60,Wonderful location,"Friendly staff, clean rooms, changing towels and sheet everyday, delicious breakfast, and centre of La Rambla street which is very famous. Also across the Placa Reial and Gotic street.. you can walk to seaside also. Metro station is near the hotel. You can go everywhere by metro. If I come again to Barcelona I would stay there. 
Also Thanks fir the candies in our room☺",5,2017,11,17
60,Step Back in Time,"Despite the title I gave this it is in fact quite modern inside, the hotel is on Las Ramblas which is a pedestrian area with a one way street on each side so your taxi can drop you at the door of this 19th century building. On the pedestrian walkway there are outdoor restaurants and covered shops selling souvenirs, close by is a daily market and a plaza which is full of restaurants. In other words a great location. The staff are friendly and helpful and there is free Wifi and in room safe. My Wife and I requested twin beds because we find the European double beds very small, this resulted in a larger room with 2 large twins and a single bed. Breakfast is also included and is an extensive buffet.",4,2017,11,16
60,Nice Hotel,"Our room was way too small with no coffee maker or any counter space for toiletries and had no desk and chair to work with our laptop.  But hey, that's fine.  Room was clean and quiet (thank God).  Breakfast was wonderful! The staff was very helpful and nice.  The location of this hotel is the best!  I would totally recommend this hotel.",4,2017,11,15
60,Great location,"We stayed for 4 nights with 2 kids (6yo and 2 yo).  Loved the location, the hotel is next to dozens of restaurants and shops. Sight seeing was easily accessible. The staff was friendly. Breakfast was not too bad but not the best either. The rooms were clean. We didn't have a problem during our stay so our overall stay was good.",4,2017,11,14
60,We really had a great time and enjoyed our stay ,"Location is marvellous. Balcony with views to Las Ramblas is gorgeous and I would strongly recommend to choose rooms with that views. We booked a Standard Room and it was nice and easy. Not very big, but price/quality was really good (3 nights offer, directly from the property). 
Staff was very friendly and helpful. 
We recommend a stay in this nice hotel. ",4,2017,11,12

60,4 day visit to Barcelona,"This was a great hotel. Very central being right on Las Ramblas. Rooms were lovely, breakfasts really nice (enough variety for all nationalities to be happy) and staff very helpful. My only complaint was the bed was too hard. I solved this by sleeping on top of a spare duvet. Good room service and excellent coffee.",4,2017,11,11
60,Balcony overlooking La Rambla,"We stayed in the hotel last week and we enjoyed it a lot. Very good location, close to shopping, metro and sights. The room was nice and clean with lots of space and the best part: with 2 balconies overlooking La Rambla!
The staff was very friendly and helpful from the front desk to the cleaning lady.  Everybody speaks English. 
Breakfast is varied, they have something special every morning so you will not get bored. They even asked us to fill in a survey to improve their breakfast service. 
We definitely would go back, right away!",5,2017,11,11
60,Gem on Ramblas,We stayed 3 nights in a charming Ramblas view room with small balcony. The staff was friendly and always helpful. Room was clean but small. Best part was the location very near the Liceu Metro and easy walking distances to Placa Catalunya and Gothic . So many restaurants and a grocery nearby as well. It was just what we had hoped. Breakfast was good and even featured Iberian Jamon one morning. The pastries are good too but eggs not so much. We enjoyed our stay here very much.,4,2017,11,10
60,Very good Highly recommend,"We visit the hotel last weekend
The bezst location u can get.
In the center on the rambla street.
Every thing is neer  a few steps from everything  la boqureia market. The gotic area. Catedrala, the metro station is next to the hotel
The service of staff  ans the front desk is great.
The rooms are in good size and very clean
Highly recommend
My favorit hotel in barcelona",5,2017,11,09
60,Great value in the centre of Barcelona . . . .,"This budget hotel offers modestly (but adequately) equipped rooms at a fair price. If you enjoy people-watching then a room overlooking La Rambla might well meet your needs. In our case the room had a pair of tall windows that opened on to the street. At first the concern was that it might be noisy but we were assured by the hotel that we would not be disturbed with the doors closed — and they were right. 

Breakfast is available if you wish it and is buffet-style in a large room on the second floor. The Wi-Fi can be quickly accessed and is included as part of the room charge.

The hotel seems to be popular with the younger traveler but we did not feel out of place as budget-minded seniors. Our room was equipped with a small closet and a fairly large bathroom. The bed was comfortable and we found the pillows, which at first seemed pretty solid to actually be quite good.

Of course the location of this hotel is its main advantage as you step from its entrance right on to La Rambla with all its activities.",4,2017,11,07
60,Recent visit to Barcelona,"Hotel was clean and the staff were very helpful. We chose a room around the back which was quiet.
The breakfast gave you a good start to the day and had sufficient variety.
It was a great position in the city to enable us to get around.",5,2017,11,06
60,Barcelona in two days,"Do you have a hard time selecting a hotel in a city you would really like to get to know better, but you are short on time?  If that is true for you, then this is your hotel. It is situated right on the Rambla, on the same side as the internationally renowned Barcelona Marketplace, right next to the Opera, and a short walk to the harbor. We used the Hop-on-Hop-off bus (two-day pass) to first understand the lay of the city, and then to quickly get to our selected sites for a closer second look. That bus stops just minutes away from this hotel.  The hotel is very clean, the rooms are adequate in size, and the bathrooms are great. Not a fancy hotel, but very classy and staffed by very friendly, very helpful English-speaking employees who really want to help make your visit a good one. We were traveling through France, Spain, and Portugal, and no other hotel came close to being the right combination of comfort, cost, and location.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,11,04
60,a quiet and beautiful place in the heart of a fast moving city,"smiling staff, quiet rooms, good breakfast in a nice place,free left luggage, near of the subway on the Ramblas. Just do not ask for a room with a view on the street, it could be noisy all night long !",5,2017,11,03

60,Hotel on Las Ramblas,"This 3* hotel is situated about two thirds of the way down Las Rambles (or a third of the way up from the harbour - which ever way you want to look at it). It is in an exceptionally convenient position for Plaza Real ( restaurants on all 4 sides and a most attractive square with its fountain and palm trees), the Liceu Theatre, La Bocqueria market and all the attractions around the harbour.
I understand that it was originally a monastery but has been a hotel since the late 1800`s. The building has a square design (if you could look down on top of it) with rooms on all 4 sides and the central space now hosts the breakfast room which has a glass, pyramidal roof above it.
Breakfast was from 7.00 am to 11.00 am each day and there was plenty of choice - hot and cold. Fruit, juices, cereals, yoghurts, small delicious brown rolls, toasting bread, butter, preserves, Catalan sausage, cheeses, ham, chorizo, coffee (good) from 2 machines and various teas. You certainly won`t starve!! There is free wi-fi
The rooms are modern and my bed was firm but very comfortable and I had good sleep. All en-suite of course. In the bedroom there is a security safe (digital setting you choose your own numbers - don`t forget to write it down !!) which you do not pay extra for. The rooms are serviced every day and are very clean.
The reception staff are really helpful and if you need to leave your luggage because your flight is later in the day they have a special room for this; you are given a number so that it can be easily located. Check-out was 10.00 am.",4,2017,10,20
60,Location! Location! Location!,"Great location, very friendly staff at reception and clean! All you need for a successful city trip.   Surrounded by places to eat and near a metro station. Short walk to the Gothic quarter, the Catalan Square where you can get the tour buses and also embark on some free walking tours. Just along the street is the famous mercado - a sight to behold. ",5,2017,10,19
60,in the HEART of BARCELONA,"We stayed there last week Oct 11-14.  The location is Bull's eye Right on La Rambla. The room is simple, average but accommodating for sure. Some things are lacking but the reasonable rates , compared to other Barcelona hotels, make up for it. Must emphasize that the staff was extremely pleasant and helpful, professional yet friendly. They catered to all our needs with a good attitude.We would definitely go back there .",4,2017,10,19
60,Comfortable and a central location,"Our room was very small (about 60cm either side of the large bed) but faced the rear so was nice and quiet at night, even with the window open.  Excellent quiet integral air-conditioning.  Good en-suite with a good shower.  Safe in the room for valuables.  Good free wifi.  No coffee facilities in the room and typically flat european style pillows.  Loads of cafes and restaurants very close.  No bar - it's just to supply drinks for guests sitting at the restaurant outside.  Good breakfast = small cooked selection + european style meat/cheese + excellent fruit selection + pastries + good coffee machines.
Central location - 2min to metro, 5-10min to Placa de Catalunya, 25-30min to the beach.
Friendly helpful staff with excellent English spoken for those complicated conversations.",4,2017,10,19
60,Only good thing is location,"We stayed at the Oriente Atiram for 3 days, it has a great location and proximity to the Gothic quarter/multiple restaurants. We requested a couple of pillows when we arrived and were told that the hotel did not have any spares (really?). We asked for a clothes iron, the receptionist told me that they didn't have one.. and then complained about me to a colleague (These people come to a 3 star hotel and no other hotel has one; I have no idea what they expect). Also, the rooms which are at the lower levels can get pretty loud on the weekends. Also there is the question of the shower curtain that wants to stick to you when to you shower. Worst service ever.",1,2017,10,17
60,First time visit to Barcelona,"This hotel being on the Rambla was as central a you can get, comfortable rooms good sized bathroom with a good shower & bidet.
Pity no restaurant or lounge bar, the small bar was very sparse and what bar/hotel in Spain does not have brandy?
Breakfasts were good with a slightly different selection each day.
Staff very friendly and helpful.",3,2017,10,15
60,Excellent Location,"We stayed here for one night during an unexpected stop-over in Barcelona, we booked this hotel at the last minute as it was central.
This hotel is right on the main Ramblas tourist area almost next to the Liceau (?sp) metro station.
This is an older style hotel that has had a certain amount of work done to bring the decor up to modern standards. The reception area has a certain 'period' feel about it. One of the two lifts was out of action during our stay.
Our room was perfectly clean, and looked over a small courtyard, with a police station car-park nearby. There was no significant noise from outside evern with the window open (YES! real opening windows!). The air conditioning was not controlable - it was either on or off. There was a good sized shower; the bed was huge and very comfortable.
The biggest dissapointment with the room was the lack of tea/coffee making facilities - this is a must (in my opinion) in any modern hotel.
The breakfast was also dissapointing in many respects - there was very little organisation of tables, and clearing tables was rather slow. The cooked food was inedible (I suspect the bacon was just heated ham), although the melon and pineapple from the cold buffet were excellent.
For a central hotel - if you don't mind the lack of room drinks facilites - this is a good choice, but get breakfast in one of the many cafes outside.",4,2017,10,15
60,Very nice,Very clean nice size room but no tea or coffe making facilities which spoilt it you couldn't even get a coffee in the hotel breakfast was really nice but didn't book in advance so just paid for breakfast as we went which meant you could also eat outside if you wanted,3,2017,10,05
60,TRIP TO BARCELONA TO SEE THE SITES,"This Hotel is very centrally located, but it is not cheap for what you get.  3 nights was around €498.00 They look like they may be doing up some of the other rooms, as they have the new electronic key entry systems.  There is not way to double lock the old rooms once inside, no bold or security catch. Our room was very dated and tired.  Maybe, some of the superior rooms are better, but ours certainly missed the boat.  We did ask for an alternative room, but was told none were available until the next night and there would be an additional charge.

The most important thing in a hotel room is the bed and pillows and I am afraid they failed on both scores, the beds were lumpy and uncomfortable.  In this day and age it is nice to have a kettle and tea making facilities, but you only get these on the superior rooms, so beware when looking at the photos, they are of the deluxe rooms.  This is a very busy hotel, but no bar and no restaurant.  There is a restaurant directly next door, but you cannot sit on the terrace unless you drink a pitcher of beer or sangria.  If you order a small beer or glass a wine, you are not allowed.

My advice is check out what else is available and the prices, because all though you are probably just paying for the location, there are others pretty close that would give you a better nights sleep.  

However, the staff are very friendly and helpful which is very important.",3,2017,10,02
60,Good value,"The staff are excellent and very helpful. I was able to leave my luggage on my return from an away trip until it was time to leave for the airport. As I stayed before the away trip the staff allowed me to leave the luggage on my return. This allowed me to visit Barcelona for some hours. Very grateful to the staff Faviola, Daniel, Emmanuelle.",4,2017,10,01
60,"Great Location, Friendly Staff","Great location right on La Rambla near Liceau station. Short walk to many sites, shopping, and restaurants including La Boqueria!  Simple, comfortable accommodations, my room didn't have a view but that made it fairly quiet. Staff was friendly and helpful.",4,2017,09,30
60,great hotel,"perfect location, clean hotel,nice breakfast
Large and pleasant lobby. Receptionists are very nice
noisy in the night but it is due to the excellent location of the hotel on the Rambla
Third time in the same hotel and very satisfied",5,2017,09,30
60,Awesome hotel! Highly recommended,"Initially we checked into our room which was very sound internally, however we had a very restricted view.... if you could even call it a view! We looked out on a brick wall and the service containment! We were not made aware we wouldn't have a view when we booked with the hotel online so were disappointed! However, we informed reception that we were unhappy and they very kindly moved us to another room overlooking the Ramblas with no fuss of questions asked! 

Again the room was lovely, the cleaning service was good, and considering the room over looked the Ramblas, which can be noisy at night, it was very sound proof! 

The reception staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. 
The hotel is really well placed - right in the middle of las Ramblas and right opposite is plaza real, which is full of restaurants and bars! 

This is my first trip advisor review and I wanted the hotel to receive the credit it deserves! ",5,2017,09,25
60,Good Location,"Hotel in a great location , good for getting about to see the sights, Reception staff were very good , friendly and informative, the breakfast room  was  light and airy, the  buffet breakfast was good .  Bit disappointed with the room (No 225) as had 2 windows with obscure glass in them,   when open, could hear a/c duct  and the room backed onto the lifts. the bathroom door had no handles on the inside , is was like coming out of salon !! Although had a wardrobe, could have done with a set of drawers. Overall the room was clean and adequate.",3,2017,09,21
60,"The good, the bad and the ugly","The good:
The hotel is clean and the staff are very friendly. The beds were very comfortable and the pillows to my liking, we also had a room at the back (as recommended by a friend) so it was very quiet ensuring a good night's sleep. 

The WI-FI throughout the whole hotel was quick and had a very good signal. 

A very convenient location within walking distance of many things and with good transport links. 

The bad:
The shower is nothing more the a curtain hung up in the 'bathroom' (there's no bath BTW) and therefore the water would run out flooding the room. 

There were hardly any plug/electrical sockets and little in the way of storage - one hanging rail, one shelf and two small bedside cabinets. 

It's is Spain yet the TV needs more channels in different languages, even if it's music channels.

The ugly:
Don't bother with breakfast! Unless you want greasy meat, runny eggs & bad coffee, there are plenty of places to eat around the hotel. ",3,2017,09,21
60,experience,"Paid 1250 DK for a room without window, epoxy treated concrete floor, the door to the toilet and bathroom were closets, all in all it looked like a depot room that was climbed up as room, warned off room 225.
Very disappointing since the hotel pictures did not at any time have shown the category of room we slept for 4 nights it was horrible.",1,2017,09,21
60,"Average hotel, noisy and not enough electrical outlets!","My granddaughter and I spent 3 nights here.  We arranged our room through Booking.com online.  When we checked in, we were told we needed to pay the full amount up front.  OK, no problem.  The room was 3 twin beds and very small.  We found there was only ONE outlet in the bathroom!!!  What with all of today's travelers using electronic devices, ONE outlet?????  Unbelievable.  we unplugged the TV and thankfully, we had 2 power converter extension bars which we made work.

The breakfast which was included, was quite nice.  Had many selections and the room was nice and neat and clean.  

The location is right on Las Ramblas and even though we had a room facing a side alley, the room walls themselves were noisy.  Beds were very lumpy and you could feel the springs when you moved around.  Not very comfy.

This hotel worked for our visit since we were not in the hotel very much, but I probably would not return next time.",3,2017,09,20
60,the best,i think emanuele and andrea are the best guys ever to work with us. so helpfull and nice . it s just incredibly making us feel confortable. anytime we call for help or information we find them all helpfull .,5,2017,09,12
60,Excellent value for money in a fab location,"This hotel was ideally located on Las Ramblas and very handy for getting about.  The breakfast was good and was set in a pleasant dining room.  We had a luxury room with double glazed French doors onto a Juliet balcony overlooking Las Ramblas.  The double glazing was very effective and we didn't find the noise levels disturbing despite other reviews raising this as a concern.  The room itself was not luxury by any means it but it was clean and did the job !  I would stay here again, although if you are looking for a touch of luxury the Hotel 1898 further up Las Ramblas was beautiful.  ",5,2017,09,12
60,Barcelona,"Fantastic location , very clea hotel  , staff very helpful and professional, my sister and I did not like our room as it was at the side of the hotel we were moved no hassle to a lovely room. We had a very enjoyable weekend here . Breakfast buffet disappointing but loads of places nearby to get food , early morning coffee etc.loved our stay , staff at hotel contributed to that",5,2017,09,11
60,Heart of La Rambla,"For access to La Rambla this hotel is ideal. It is very clean and the staff are very friendly. It follows the European model of pushing two small beds together to try to make a large one. For a continental breakfast, I thought the selection was good. As far as the bed comfort goes, it was on the harder side of the scale. I would go back just for the shower. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a shower with so much water pressure. 

For me the only downside to our room was that even with the balcony door closed the street noise off of La Rambla was still noticeable at night. All things considered I would stay again.",4,2017,09,09
60,Fabulous location,"Everything was great. The location without equal, right in the heart of La Rambla, opposite Placa Reial. . Fab cafes outside. Everywhere spotless. Modern decor. The staff were friendly and helpful. Amazing trip. Thank you.",5,2017,09,08
60,Great location,Excellent location amidst the lively Las Ramblas. The room was clean and comfortable and the ensuite had a bath with a powerful shower. The staff were young and not always able to answer our questions but helpful in other ways.,4,2017,09,04
60,Everything average ,"Basic rooms ....double bed size is very small ,2 ppl can hardly sleep comfortably. Breakfast lacks variety, average breakfast. Staff at reception was very helpful whereas at breakfast area wasnt ...location of the hotel is perfect , right in the middle of la ramblas street .",2,2017,09,04
60,Great location - bed like a slab.,"Just spent 1 night in a basic room. The location and the building is fantastic. 
Our bed was as hard as a mortuary slab I feel as if I've been beaten up. . No tea or coffee facilities in the room. 
Breakfast was basic but nice , but powdered scrambled egg and a coffee is from a machine. 
The aircon machine is more of a fan. It luckily we did not have the hottest 
Day",3,2017,09,04
60,Poor slow staff,"Overpriced and bad slow staff. On the night we arrived the receptionist took an age checking us in whilst loud music was playing, not what you want after long days travel. Room was clean but very basic and dated with few amenities and poor quality beds on wheels. The view from window was a solid brick wall For the price I would expect much much more. Also be wary about the location, slap bang on la rambla. Would not book again, Id make sure I booked much further in advance for a nicer hotel!",2,2017,09,03
60,Perfect ,"Everything is perfect, the location is great, it in the middle of Rambla , steps to Catalonia Sq., and you can go to the beach on foot, the room is clean, the bed is comfortable, all the stuff are nice and helpful except one his name is Alex, the restaurants around the hotel every where, the stores, very kind of shopping you can get, it is perfect ",5,2017,08,29
60,Sad room,"The hotel's photos of the rooms looked lovely so I was crestfallen when we walked into our allotted room - it was old fashioned, dark, shabby and uncomfortable. No lovely bright bed spreads and curtains, no padded headboard, no stylish furniture. The room was painted light brown wood chip wallpaper, the headboards were wooden and uncomfortable to lean against (even using the thin pillows), the TV signal was so bad we couldn't get a clear image (but no English channels so didn't use anyway). We could hear peoples' conversations in the rooms next door, and the Metro trains rumbling by underneath us. Our view was the wall opposite in a narrow side street. Given we spent over £1,000 on the room I was more than disappointed. Given the hotel's location we did expect some street noise. The convenient location  is why I didn't give the hotel lower ratings.",3,2017,08,28
60,Juneyc,"Perfect location with very nice comfortable room.  Ideal for our 3 night stay before a cruise. We had a small balcony overlooking Las Ramblas. Despite reviewers complaining about noise we found no issue and we were directly above the main entrance. We had a wonderful view in both directions.Mini bar is stocked with soft drinks, water, crisps and chocolate and replaced daily. Tea and coffee also provided. Breakfast adequate in nice surroundings and helpful staff. Would definitely return.
",4,2017,08,28
60,Sensational location in Central Barcelona,"Sensational location right on Las Ramblas Unfortunately the scene of the recent atrocity. Rooms not big by Aussie standards however very clean & obliging staff. No tea & coffee making facilities which is normal here. Such a vibrant city, beautiful locals & it's right at your door step. Lots of restaurants for breakfast, lunch & dinner so close by
Quiet if you're at the rear of the hotel
No balcony you could stand on but little Juliette balcony to enjoy the vibe
Hop on hop off bus just a stroll away. Well worth doing.  Picasso museum just a stroll away as well 
A beautiful city",4,2017,08,28
60,GREAT STAFF & LOCATION,"Well .. it's in perfect location in las ramblas over viewing the wonderful street with its cafes and restaurants .. staff are very helpful and gentle they will do their best to help you especially in my case the receptionist Emanuel was very good to me !
But the hotel lacks some facilities .. no good in room dining and the worst fact i faced that many rooms doesn't has a fridge .. and off course a kettle.  ",3,2017,08,27
60,Well located hotel on Ramblas,"Centrally located hotel in the most popular Ramblas area, more like the heart of Barcelona. Well looked after, very good and polite staff, who would go to any extent to help you. Only 1 problem, they were fully booked when we went, and no time extension for late checkout for the customers. Please sort that out!",5,2017,08,20
60,"Location is amazing, but service let me down","Location wise is an awesome aspect, but on my check in experience I didn`t feel the front desk people were properly trained. As we were doing the check in, attendant was a bit rude, made me walk out, withdraw money from my card to pay it in cash. When I came back to pay it in cash. The other feature was the room, which I found quite small for the value I paid EUR",3,2017,08,19
60,Disappointed,My daughter and I stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights. The room was an interior one with no natural light nor outside window. I wish we could have known this before I booked as the price per night was way too high for a room of this standard. We asked four times if we could have an extra pillow as the ones provided were practically flat but no-one got back to us to confirm they were or weren't coming. I feel I paid way too much for this room. Las Ramblas is a very busy area with a heavy police presence at night. I would not stay here again.,3,2017,08,16
60,Loud on las ramblas,"Hotel staff was polite.  Rooms were very loud, street noise and neighboring room kept us awake.  Location is great and convenient to Plaça Catalunya and Gothic Quarter.  Breakfast was adequate.  No water in rooms and vending machine was not functioning. ",3,2017,08,07
60,Weekend City Break ,"When i checked in & got given my room key by a miserable receptionist, went up to my room, & walked in on a couple having sex. Had this not have happened I would give 4 stars. 
We went down and complained & they weren't sorry enough & then made us wait for a room. It made me concerned about the hotel security. 
However apart from my bad start, we had a fantastic time. The best thing about this hotel is the location, it is perfect. It is near everything you are right in the heart so obviously with that comes noise. We were on the LaRambla side so a lot of street noise but it didn't bother us at all as we drank every night! Rooms are clean & one particular receptionist was friendly and remembered it was my birthday which was nice! 
We didn't eat here, there is a bar outside on the street which is convenient (But expensive!) 
Overall I would recommend this hotel as the location is amazing!  ",3,2017,08,07
60,Weekend city break,"Basic hotel that needs a bit of an update, Staff were friendly enough, the hotel was claen and tidy. Perfect location to sample the city day and night life. bedrooms were a little small and under equiped, only one double plug socket for the whole room. ",3,2017,07,31
60,Excellent location and lovely staff,"We stayed here for 5 nights for a city break. My son and daughter were upgraded to a deluxe room which had brilliant air conditioning but was on the La Rambla side of the hotel so got a little street noise. we were on the quiet side but our air conditioning was not adjustable and so the room felt quite warm. The breakfast offered a good choice of hot and cold food. The rooms were basic but clean and the location of the hotel was excellent for seeing all the sights. The metro station was a couple of minutes walk and we bought three day passes which made travelling very easy. We went on a free walking tour which was really informative besides going to Parc Guell, Sagrada Familia and the beach. Load of shops so lots of reatail therapy and so many restaurants with tapas and other great food.",5,2017,07,28
60,Great location and nice breakfast,"We stayed for four nights. Great breakfast and nice rooms, some noice from the Rambla, and also from adjacent rooms. Price to match the location, but after all price was acceptable.
100 meters to Liceau metro station and also bus 59 to the beach :-)",4,2017,07,28
60,Horrible ,"After looking for a month for a nice hotel in Barcelona I made a mistake of choosing this hotel , that doesn't care about anything besides taking your money , let's start with the -check in :unprofessional speaking loudly about pricing and rolling eyes about other guests . - the room : small with no design or amenities, ugly bathroom with no bidé or light dimmers , no hair conditioner , very small tv and poor air conditioning but the worse is the costumer service , I ask for places for dinner or drinks and they didn't know anything, I ask how to get the hotel 1898 roof top that has one the more famous bars in Barcelona and the look at me like I was asking for the moon , ask front desk for a toothbrush and they send to a Chinese store to buy it , Unacceptable when paying 200 dollars a night , the front desk is very casual and untrained calling me compañero few times. I'm not your friend, I'm a paying Guest !! To end this review: the minute that you walk out of the hotel you will find : prostitutes , people screaming, going to the bathroom in the street, selling drugs and counterfeit and trying to rip you off, literally a Zoo .Do no stay Here and if you do . Well you're going to regret it.",3,2017,07,26
60,Mixed feelings,"Check in was easy and the room was one of the larger triples I've stayed in while in Europe.  The hotel itself is very nice, clean, and perfectly located. The beds, however, were hard and difficult to sleep on. The walls were PAPER THIN and you could listen in on the conversation of those in the room next door and write it down word for word. 
I have never had worse sleep in any hotel in my life. Two nights in a row I was woken up at 5 AM because the guests next door were speaking loudly. Normally guests speaking at 5 am wouldn't be an issue, but here it was because of how thin the walls were. Avoid staying in 435 in you want quality sleep... there is NO sleep to be had in this room.(And it was not even a front facing room).  I even complained a few times but nothing changed. 
Other than the sleep quality, the hotel is in the best place it can possibly be!!",3,2017,07,21
60,"Reasonable hotel close to Metro, great breakfast","We were very satisfied with our stay and would recommend this to anyone looking to stay right on la ramblas. Staff was polite and professional and the room was good. We paid for the breakfast and it was an excellent value with good service and good food.

We booked a small interior room and got a small interior room. The bathroom was relatively modern, the furniture was in good shape. The only minor complaints I have were, There were too few electrical outlets available in the room, one in the sleeping area and one in the bathroom. The AC was... a little weak, but did function and cooled the room when given a long time. I went out and bought a fan though.",5,2017,07,20
60,Suited us perfectly,"This hotel has just about everything from a medium priced hotel.
+ Faultless location right on Ramblas
+Bars and restaurants everywhere you look and turn.
+ Great buffet breakfast
+Rooms were relatively basic but very clean and adequate.(what more do you want when visiting Barcelona as there is so much to see rather than sitting in your hotel room)
+ Wifi was not very good and did not connect for us at all during our 3 nights (hey...so what!)
+ We had a Ramblas Room with balcony (very small)which opened directly onto the Ramblas. However, rooms were quiet and after long days walking and a few drinks any low level noise did not keep us awake!
+Air conditioning worked well in 85 deg temperatures outside
+Efficient and friendly staff.
+Liceu Metro station just a 1 minute walk away

Barcelona is such a wonderful place to visit (our 2nd time) and this hotel could not be faulted at all and would stay here should we visit again.

PS We got the best deal by booking directly with the hotel.",4,2017,07,17
60,Good Family Hotel and Great Location,"First, it's challenging to find a room for a family of 4. This hotel provided a large size room with a large bathroom. Hotel was clean and, for a bit more, provided a really nice breakfast. A/C is provided and the location is wonderful. It was a 35 euro taxi ride from the airport and 15 euros to the cruise port. From this hotel, you might think you can walk to your ship, but trust me- you can't. Restaurants, shops and a large open air market were within easy walking distance, as was the Flamenco Cordobes. In addition, we were able to walk to our meeting spots for our tours. Some say it is noisy. We had a room facing Las Ramblas. I opened the windows, stepped on the balcony and soaked in the exciting atmosphere. Staff let us store our luggage until our 2p check-in and even offered a shower/bathroom if needed before check-in. There is a small elevator and helpful front desk staff. I would definitely stay there again with my family.",4,2017,07,15
60,Family Vacation ,"We stayed for few days before our cruise to the Mediterranean and the hotel was good the rooms was cozy, bathrooms was great and the service but the only thing I wasn't impressed were the beds they were hard and the pillow flat and the AC could of being better. We had breakfast at the hotel one day and the food was great but again the AC wasn't working. 
Also we asked at the front desk to see if we could get extra pillows to sleep better but the lady said she was gonna try to see if they have more but we never got any extra pillow. 
Location was perfect many restaurants and bars around. Local stores, Pharmacy anything you need is a walking distance ",3,2017,07,15
60,Great Location ,"This hotel was a great choice. Apparently, taxi drivers frequently strike there so having a central location where I could walk everywhere was a life saver. The view from my room of Las Ramblas was great, if a bit noisy. Breakfast was terrific. It's a bit dated but overall a great hotel. ",4,2017,07,14
60,Ideal,"Great location - rooms at back perfect-exceptionally clean - cleaning staff seemed to take a genuine pride , perhaps motivated by wall mural of cleaning staff. Air conditioning worked well . Shower was excellent. Breakfast was really good. Layout was great and variety of foods available. Serving staff were great - attentive when needed but not in your face.",4,2017,07,13
60,Disappointing - and noisy,"An overworked and understaffed check in area manned by cheery staff. Bare minimum facilities. Noisy floorboards, no team making, no tissues, primitive vanity, just one blanket and dodgy power points.  Even on the fourth floor the street noise from Ramblas is untenable all night long and despite double glazing. Good breakfasts in an pleasant dining room manned by efficient and good natured staff. Expensive for what it is",3,2017,07,11
60,Worst hotel ever,"I was expecting more for what we paid. Very cheap soap, shampoo ... Wasn't able to sleep from the horrible pillows. Too noisy. Can hear the people chatting on the room next to us. You can always hear The sound of the water coming through the water pipes in the toilet throughout the day and nught.  Worst experience ever ",1,2017,07,08
60,Great place to stay before or after your cruise.,"Clean and comfortable, rooms are not large but being right on La Rambla who is going to spend much time there anyway.
The location is great, and close to a metro stop. Great food and shops right out the front door. The free breakfast is delicious way to start your day.",4,2017,06,30
60,Fanstaic staff and amazing location ,"Situated in the heart of Barcelona, this hotel is just what you need. 
Amazing staff and perfectly located in the liveliest street in Barcelona. La ramblas is the most touristy street in Barcelona. The hotel is 5 min walk for the Columbus statue and the Barcelona square. ",5,2017,06,26
60,VERY BASIC HOTEL HAD EXPECTED LITTLE MORE IN THIS PRICE,I stayed in this hotel in mid April and the prices of the hotel were too high according to the facilities. The room was pretty small and the beds were squiky making a lot of noise even with a slightest weight. The room looks pretty old and needs maintaince. I agree the  location is bang on ramblas but there were other good options to stay with better access to shopping. The breakfast was also quite okay just had a banana.,1,2017,06,26
60,Brilliant location and hotel,"A convenient hotel to explore all the central places of interest with friends. Would recommend the 48 hour city bus tours ""hop on and off"" to key places of interest. Very comfortable hotel, quiet aircon and very helpful hotel staff. Tourist Information right opposite hotel. Breakfast choice good and varied.",5,2017,06,24
60,Very good choice. ,"We stayed here for 5 nights. Chosen on spec as we hadn't been to Barcelona before. It proved a good choice. Great location just a stroll away from many places of interest & right  next to the metro. 
We opted for a deluxe room & it was definitely worth it. Balcony facing las ramblas, air con and a mini fridge topped up with water & soft drinks daily. Room was spacious & cleaned well all week. 
Breakfast was decent, reasonable choice to set you up for the day. Even when we got to breakfast later everything had been topped up. 
Finally we had been concerned about noise from the street after reading previous reviews. We were on the 4th floor which probably helped but it really wasn't an issue. The windows shut out the noise pretty much completely at night. 
Overall a very good choice for our needs. We will consider staying here again when we come back to Barcelona. ",4,2017,06,24
60,Great location ,Located on the La Ramblas you can step out the door into the heart of the action. The hotel is older but well maintained and the a/c worked fine. Breakfast buffet was included with the room and was adequate to get a start in your day. Staff was very friendly and helpful with any request or question I may have had. Would definitely stay again. ,4,2017,06,21
60,no serious complaints but some minor stuff,"great renovations since my last stay, LOVE the art in every corridor, and the team are 
friendly and professional (as before!)

rooms need a bit more work....not enough power points, and free bottled water would be normal in most hotels at this $$ level.....

the adjacent bar (under different management) has issues, most prominent being some aggressive rude south Asian staff.....the hotel management need to address this with the bar owners to avoid collateral damage

rest ok",4,2017,06,18
60,Perfectly situated,"Perfectly situated hotel, around half way along the main street of La Rambla. Very busy area, lots of shops and restaurants and a minute or so from the metro. The hotel is stylish, modern and very clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. Payment was upon arrival, including the city tax. Facilities in the room included hairdryer, tv and safe, although the safe did not work in our room. There was a small balcony, which for us opened onto a side street. It was very hot weather at the time of our visit (32 degrees) but the hotel and our room in particular was cool and had air con. ",4,2017,06,18
60,Great location but lacks some facilities,"We have just returned having spent 3 nights in this hotel, the location is great for the many bars, restaurants and harbor, the staff were so-so with some having smiles and pleasantries and others saying the minimum, we were given a free upgrade to what they said was a 4 person room but would not like to have seen the 2 person room TBH, the air conditioning was very welcome at night and the bathroom clean and spacious, our only complaints were we saw a photo of a kettle in the room on the website and so assumed there would be one in every room, being British we like our cuppa in the morning but found no kettle in our room, on asking at reception we were informed that kettles were provided in the delux rooms only, we asked if we could hire one for our stay but were told NO, i hardly think a kettle in a room makes it DELUX. My other problem was there was no lounge / bar area as such where we could buy a cup of tea or coffee, I guess I am used to that in other hotels, all in all it was good value for money and my complaints did not spoil our break.",4,2017,06,16
60,Very Central,"We stayed here for 4days with friends. We couldn't fault the location, directly onto La Rambla. Plenty of cafes, bars etc on the doorstep. Only 5 minutes from Plac de Catalunya. 
The reception area, lifts and bar need serious refurbishment. We had La Rambla Executive rooms with great air conditioning. They could do with upgrading particularly the bathrooms. Having said that, being able to open French doors onto little balconies overlooking the street activities was superb and relaxed any concerns about the room. There was a fridge which came in very useful.
We did not eat in the hotel because of the availability for variety close by. We did visit the dining room and although a fine space seemed very hot that morning.
Our only real criticism was the reception staff. Their training seemed to be a lacking in as much as they were neither friendly nor welcoming. It also took sometime to get answers to queries. The environment they worked in was cramped, oppressive and not conducive to a positive frame of mind. Also, their uniforms were not attractive.
I hope the management take these comments onboard because this good hotel could be an excellent hotel.",3,2017,06,14
60,Good position for the gothic area,"The hotel is right on one of the main tourist streets in Barcelona - La Rambla. Its a 10 min walk to the Marina and about 20 mins to the beach. Its also possible to walk to various sites of interest, including Sagrada Familia but it will take a good 20 mins. Hotel is basic but clean. Not necessary to have breakfast there as there are many cafes and restaurants in the vicinity. ",3,2017,06,13
60,Great location,"Location was awesome. In las Ramblas which is a lovely boulevard, a few steps away from the opera house. Breakfast was really good, more of a lunch than a breakfast. I loved the balcony in my room overlooking las Ramblas. Mind you after 11pm or so it seems to be taken over by ladies of the night and their pimps which sometimes can get loud and rowdy. I say embrace it, it adds character ha! of course if you are a puritan that may be offended at such displays which have nothing to do with the hotel BTW, then perhaps this location is not for you but you would be missing on all the life that goes on during the day. My only complaint about the hotel were that the beds could be more comfortable, other than that, it was quite lovely and a great value.",4,2017,06,13
60,Great Location but noisy,"Hotel shows to be rather spartan when you enter the lobby and carries throughout the hotel including the rooms. A dorm room offers more hospitality. Had a room facing Las Ramblas and the noise from the all night parties along the boulevard kept us awake, even with ear plugs.

Only advantage is the close proximity to the water front, harbor and beaches plus near it is near public transportation terminals.",3,2017,06,11
60,Walls so thin you can hear a zipper in the next room,"Location is great. 
Staff doesnt care at all
Breakfast is almost good enough. But why have 4 different kinds of cheese when the ""Bread"" is disgusting... 
The noise makes it very hard to get some rest. The hotel is old and the renovation they did is just bad. ",2,2017,06,04
60,Great location for a city break,"On a city break you need to be in the centre of the action.  The Oriente Atirum is in an ideal location on Las Ramblas - a short walk from the transport hub at Placa Catalunya and near to the seafront and port.  Having read varying reviews we were not quite sure what to expect.  Chap on reception was very busy and we noticed the other receptionist (young lady) seemed reluctant to help.  We were quite surprised to be asked to pay immediately upon arrival, something we never been asked to do before in any country - however, it did save time when we checked out!  We had booked a double for sole use, a triple and a twin.  The rooms were all triples and a decent size.  Basic and rather tired watermarked furniture, and some damaged tiles in the bathrooms, but very clean which is what matters most, but perhaps rather expensive for the basic facilities.  Adequate toiletries.  Pillows could do with being upggraded.  Some people say the beds are hard and uncomfortable, but they were fine for us.  We had been given keys to the rooms, but found we needed cards for the electricity to work and we had not been given these - luckily there were cleaners on the corridors and they had some spare.  Later in the week 2 of the cards were missing from the rooms so one of our party went to reception. The girl said there were no cards in the key slots so she didn't have them and there were no spares (what happens if some go missing?).  When asked what to do she didn't offer to contact housekeeping, just shrugged and repeated that there were no spare cards.  Luckily again the cleaners were around and came to the rescue, but not a good point for reception as no help offered - what if cards the cleaners had not been there, were we supposed to manage without lights etc? Doors bang very loudly and keys make a lot of noise when locking the door, so quite noisy when guests returning at night, and walls quite thin, but we had quite quiet neighbours!.  Did notice what we assumed were the deluxe rooms had keycard entry which is rather quieter.  The plus point for this hotel is the breakfast buffet - one of the reasons we chose this hotel over others, as having children with us it helps to fill them up at breakfast!  Good choice of foods and drinks for any taste. The only disappointment was that there was only one day with a Catalan corner the other days the special breakfast was always cakes.  A good selection, but not something we wished to encourage the children to eat.  Over all hotel fine and would recommend to others for the location.",4,2017,06,03
60,3 stars is very accurate but perfect location,"Hotel is always clean but it needs a remodel. Very tired and old and the rooms are quite hostel styled. The balconys could use chairs so you can just relax as relaxing in the room isn't very nice. The noise from the street is very loud but it didn't Bother us too much, it's just people having fun and didn't affect our sleep. I think it's very over priced but your paying for the location which is very central. ",3,2017,05,31
60,"Average hotel, but in a perfect location to explore Barcelona!","Just spent 5 nights at the Oriente. I booked and paid extra for a 'room with a view', which we had...however, the room and bathroom were very small, the balcony was tiny....and the safe didn't work. My friends booked a deluxe room which was slightly bigger and did have a fridge....not much difference for the price though. 
It was noisy at night....but, considering the amazing position on the Ramblas, that's unavoidable,. Breakfast is fairly mediocre...I would recommend visiting one of the many lovely local cafes for a delicious breakfast instead.
The situation of the hotel for sightseeing is perfect...the fabulous market is round the corner, the subway and tour bus stops are within easy walking distance...and there are too many wonderful bars and restaurants near by to mention.
The one thing I did find sad about the Oriente is the poor way that this obviously once, very grand hotel, has been renovated...needs a bit more TLC. ",3,2017,05,30
60,"Strategic location, clean rooms","
Stayed here for 4 nights 
Pros:
Location of hotel: very good, situated along las ramblas, short walk (maybe 2-3 mins) to Liceu station (metro), walkable to placa catalunya (where aerobus,  bus to airport is) near port vell and the bouqueria.
Rooms: our room was on the 4th floor, big size, always kept clean by housekeeping. With airconditioning which you can control.
Bathroom: adequate size, good lighting, always clean. 
Amenities: with bath gel, soap shampoo but no tooth brush toothpaste or cotton. 
Wifi: free in room: not so fast can be unreliable at times.
Staff: reception: helpful and accommodating, housekeeping:  always greeting, with special notes on mirror :) 
Cons:
No water heater for coffee or tea. No ref.  No ironing board and iron. 
Can get a little noisy at night 
All in all, i recommend this place based on location, cleanliness of rooms. But it would be an excellent experience to have a water boiler for coffee or tea at least and ref. ;)

60,it was very unsatisfactory,"the attitude of the front desk personnel checking us in needed a lot to be desired. Despite my small talk and attempt to humour her, she remained straight faced and uninterested.
What was worst was that she conveniently forgot to inform us of our room location. Who in their right mind would think that Room 446 is located between Room 409 and 410? But ok, who am I to judge them - except this information would have saved us from carrying three heavy luggage up and down (several) three flights of steps (which is not very friendly if you are  wheelchair bound) three times around the maze of corridors??",1,2017,05,28
60,"Family room,  ideal location","We arrived at the hotel this afternoon. We are staying in room 303. We have two Juliette balconies overlooking the Ramblas and a nice large family size room. Everything is spotless and the shower is the fiercest we have ever had in a hotel. The staff were efficient and friendly on arrival. I requested some extra pillows on the way out to dinner and they were here with no fuss on our return. 
Location is perfect and people watching from the balcony is great
Would definitely stay here again ",5,2017,05,28
60,Perfect Location,Reception personnel were continually rushed. Only the young man seemed to be able to be both helpful & polite. Breakfasts were average if you expected cooked but the continental breakfast was excellent. Rooms very clean complete with air con.,3,2017,05,28
60,Nice & Friendly,"Great location, clean, good staff, nice continental breakfast (sometimes forgot the eggs though). Situated in the heart of La Rambla. We had 4 nights there and were very comfortable.

60,"Great hotel, great location","Great location in the Ramblas, about 5 mins walk from the sea, and 5 mins away from the centre of Ramblas. 
Really nice hotel- with breakfast service 7-11am. Bar and food throughout the day outside the hotel.
Even though outside there was noise from how busy the bars etc were, no lost sleep-quiet.
Free wifi.
Just a shame about the not so happy and not so friendly staff.",5,2017,05,26
60,Could do better,"We had a single room for 4 people. Except it wasn't. It was a regular room with a sofa bed. If we were staying longer than a weekend half our party would need traction for their back aches. We had to ask for extra pillows (3 times) and extra glasses. We had no fridge/mini bar in our room either. One of my friends stood on broken glass in the room, so cleanliness was obviously not brilliant either. The air con thankfully worked, which helped to drown out the noise from next door - I don't think our neighbours were especially noisy, but the walls are made of tissue paper. If we chose to open the windows, you could hear Las Ramblas, but tbh I'd expect that. the only thing going for this place is it's proximity to Las Ramblas.",2,2017,05,23
60,Fantastic location in the center of Las ramblas,"The staff are ""people ""oriented .. so friendly and helpful. The view of Las Ramblas  
Is awesome. Walk out the door and you are in the middle of  everything. So many wonderful cafes and restaurants . The rooms are clean and the beds are comfy.  And the neighborhood accommodates walking about at all hours of the night .Very safe..
Even though there is a lot going on outside ...my room was quiet..I love this Hotel and will return.",5,2017,05,22
60,Fantastic location! Beautiful hotel.,"We have just spent 4 nights at this beautiful hotel. 
Whilst the rooms are pretty standard in size etc they were kept immaculately clean, (as was the rest of the hotel).
Clean sheets and towels every day.
Breakfast was a good combination of hot and cold buffet.
This hotel is in an ideal place to make the most of a visit to wonderful Barcelona. It is towards the bottom of Las Ramblas and very near the very vibrant Placa Reial.
Would definitely stay here again.
Our room was at the back of the hotel and incredibly quiet, (even more surprising for such a central location).
Very wheelchair accessible.",4,2017,05,21
60,In the heart of the city,"I stayed 2 nights at the end of my trip to Spain.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The first night my room was very cold.  I learned that some of my friends I was traveling with also experienced this.  They were told there was nothing they could do about it.   I asked for an extra blanket and was fine the next night.
Both nights I had to put up with inconsiderate patrons of the hotel being very loud in the hallway.  Not the hotel's fault, I know. 
Because this hotel is on La Rambla, it is close to many attractions and necessities.  We did a lot of walking.
Since I was with a church group and we will be making annual trips to Spain, I will consider booking this hotel again. ",4,2017,05,19
60,"Excellent, Central Location for 1st time visit","We arrived after a late evening flight and were checked in promptly by the reception staff (very friendly and helpful). Before bed we even managed some fresh air after a stroll along La Ramblas. The only fault I can find lies with the hard beds and the uncomfortable pillows (there should be additional pillows in each room - hotel take note!) 

The breakfast buffet and location were a lovely way to start each day and I really enjoyed the different Catalan options but glad I don't eat like that everyday. 

The nearest metro is Liceu and is barely a 2 min walk from the hotel and is directly across from the Placa Reial. There are many shops and places to eat along La Ramblas which is only 1.2km from Placa de Catalunya and the seafront.",4,2017,05,17
60,A great week,"Although the reception area is a bit on the small side the rest of the hotel is great. We found that the staff were very much customer orientated, the restaurant for breakfast was of a high standard and the atrium over the room made a lovely peaceful setting.
Our stay was for 6nights which were very quiet except for the Saturday night which was a bit noisy, being halfway down the Ramblas this was to be expected, mostly hen parties and stag dos.",5,2017,05,17
60,Great place,"This hotel is conveniently located, clean and the beds were comfortable, the staff is helpful and the price is very reasonable, close to the port and the start of a lot of the walking tours, would definitely stay again.    Paula",5,2017,05,17
60,Not Receommended!,"Let's start with the positives......

Location is GREAT! 
Rambla street is the main shopping area in Barcelona, so staying in that street is good.

Sadly, thats the ONLY good thing i've got to say about this particular hotel.

Negatives: 

1) Checked into the room, it was clean, thank god.
But i noticed there was no kettle in the room.
I went to reception and spoked to the lady and asked if i couldve a kettle, just to boil water. I've got my own teabags.
Her reply is NO, your room is standard room, so no kettle. You have to pay extra if you want to upgrade to deluxe room. 
I didnt ask for an upgrade, all i want is a kettle, so i can boil some water and use my own teabag. I've travelled to a few europeans countries and i know a kettle is a basic thing, you dont require a Deluxe room for a kettle.
When i mentioned that to her, her solution was, if u want, you can come down at night when you want your drink, we can MICROWAVE the water for you? What the........?
At that point i knew im wasting my time trying to talk sense to this person. She even gave a comment, its only 3 nights, its ok not to have tea. Excuse me, i will decide if i want to have tea or not, you dont need to decide for me.

2) Pillows: Its not a standard size, more like a kids sized pillow. Extremely uncomfortable and caused me a bad neck.

3) This walls are ULTRA THIN!!! You can hear everything from the next room. We were unlucky to have some young group of teenagers laughing n yelling so loudly. We couldnt sleep at all. I mean this was extremely loud, its like as though we were in the same room. we kept quiet for a bit but it didnt stop. I went to call the reception, the bloody phone in the room was not working. i didnt want to change my PJ and go all the way down to reception, so i just banged on my wall and said quiet. They stopped it then. This was way past midnight ....

4) We couldnt wait to leave the place, however on the last day, i wasnt feeling that well. I wanted to know if i could check out 1 hour late. Even before i finised my sentence, i received a Quick Blunt NO! I knew the rooms are not full, because we checked with the reception the night before, but this lady claims it was full. I am almost certain it is not true.

That was it, i told myself, never back here again! 
However, Barcelona City is a beautiful place though.
I will just need to find a better hotel who cares about their guests and know the true meaning of Service.

Good Luck Everyone.

Jenny",1,2017,05,16
60,"Lovely hotel, excellent location ","Stayed here from 4-7 March 17. Only paid £226 for the 3 nights, stayed in a deluxe room overlooking La Rambla. Perfect! Room had a complimentary mini bar with soft drinks, water and snacks. Replenished daily. Room not over big, but big enough, very clean, comfy beds. Reception staff very helpful. Would definitely recommend staying here to anyone that's wants a very central location, that's also very clean, and a perfect view from the balcony. Would stay here again. ",4,2017,05,13
60,3 star,"This place is a 3star hotel on las ramblas. It's close to a tube station so easy to get around Barcelona.
The breakfast was great. 
Rooms were ok. Walls are slightly thin. We were about the atrium so it was quiet but the las rambles side must be noisy.
For price it's perfect. ",3,2017,05,11
60,Excellent location ,We stayed here for 4 nights over the recent bank holiday the bus won't go direct to the hotel so we were dropped off at the bottom of la ramblas and walked it took about 6 mins. The location is definitely the best thing about the hotel right in the middle of the ramblas across the road from placa real so ideal for eating out at night. I had previously emailed the hotel requesting a quiet room so was surprised when we arrived to be told we had been upgraded for free to a superior room which looked out onto la ramblas not wishing to appear ungrateful we readily accepted however at 2.30am it became apparent that this wouldn't work!! The noise level is so high the people outside  may as well be in the room so we went to reception and they very kindly moved us even at that time of night. We had booked breakfast which was a letdown the hot food was really cold so we had a continental breakfast for the remainder of our stay. The rooms are good for a city hotel lovely power shower and pretty comfy beds if you like them firm!  The only thing that would benefit the rooms for English people would be at least 1 English Channel on the tv we weren't in the room for very long but while the other half is in the shower it would be nice to watch something in English. Overall we would recommend this hotel the staff were extremely helpful and friendly ,3,2017,05,08
60,"Great location, limited facilities.","The hotel is in a great location for seeing the 'old' city & it was easy to find.
My room was a city view, but not ready when I arrived. Even though it was book through the airline & the hotel knew my estimated arrival time..
I was told 1/2an hour, so I had to uncomfortably wait around the reception with my luggage.
3/4 hr later I asked what was going on & got handed my room key with no explanation.

The room it's self was nice enough & well presented.
My only real gripe with the rooms was the air con didn't work & blew hot air or nothing. I later found out from the reception that it doesn't work in any of the rooms.

Self service breakfast was good.

One night we decided to drink & dine in the hotel, only to find the bar & restaurant in the hotel was closed to sometime in May, even though there was no mention of this prior/during booking.",3,2017,05,08
60,Fantastic hotel and brilliant location,"We booked a last minute city break to this hotel, not knowing what to expect when we got there.  Impressed we most definitely were.  The hotel more than met our expectations, staff were extremely friendly and accommodating.  We asked to change rooms which they did without any hassle.
Hotel is in a brilliant location, 10 minutes walk to the Port, and lots of local attractions.  We easily hopped on the Red Tour bus from the hotel by walking to the port.  
Night life around the hotel was brilliant and a 2 min walk across the road into a square with great restaurants and entertainment.
Metro stops were situated all the way along La Ramblas which made it easy to get around.
Would highly recommend the hotel and if you haven't been to Barcelona before its place you must visit.  
We're going back later this year to see things we didn't get to see.  
All in all fantastic.",5,2017,05,07
60,"Could not get a better position for sight seeing,",This is the oldest hotel in Barcelona and full  of character. The rooms are small but you only sleep in them!. The only thing lacking in my opinion is the option to make a cup of tea in your room. This would  be a deal breaker if we were to return to this hotel.  Breakfast was fine as were the staff.,5,2017,05,05
60,Best hotel in Barcelona,Great hotel. Rooms are clean and spacious. Very Friendly staff. Central to all you need to do and see. On las Ramblas so you are part of a great vibe. Best place to stay when in Barcelona. Metro Liceau very close.,5,2017,05,04
60,Barcelona before cruise,"Hotel is well located to shops and restaurants,  Gothic area, short taxi to cruise line port. 30 € taxi from airport. 
Lovely from the outside though needs attention in lobby. Hotel room was clean and had a nice small balcony over Ramblas St. 
I prepaid infull on line, but was charged an additional city tax when checked out. 
All and all would stay again. ",3,2017,05,04
60,Great position unfriendly staff.,"On arrival hotel looks stunning. Downhill from entering. Room wasn't ready so cases where looked in storeroom. Went for a walk and came back an hr later, Still not ready so sat in reception area. Very cold.After another hr I approached the receptionist who went on to check if room ready after a tete a tete with another member of staff was told room now ready. Not a smile or Hello, welcome ,nothing! Room very basic old fashioned furniture. No tea or coffee facilities, Very clean and clean bedding and towels. Walls are very thin. Could hear every conversation on either side. Showers running, Even a mobile phone vibrating! It's the reception staff that really let the hotel down On checking out the receptionist hardly looked at me. Told me what I owed, took the cash not a goodbye, hope you had a nice time.......Nothing. I know management state that a lot of people are happy with reception staff but alot also state they are not. This shouldn't be ignored. Staff training regarding customer service is highly recommended.",3,2017,05,02
60,Good location,I chose this hotel because of its location on Las Rambles and it was exactly what I wanted. There were many places to shop and eat. If you don't want the local food there is a KFC and McDonald's across the road. Bus stops and the metro are close by. There is a tourist information centre close by. My room was what I expected from a three star hotel. A little tired but spotlessly clean. There was a nice welcome message on the mirror along with a rose and chocolates. The bed was comfy. The staff were helpful and friendly. Breakfast was great. I would stay here again. The rooms at the front are quite noisy so if you want a quieter room ask for one at the back. The airport shuttle buses and coaches are not allowed along Las Rambles so they drop off at the top or bottom and so it's a walk to any of the hotels. This might be a problem for some people. It's about a 6 minutes walk to this hotel,4,2017,05,02
60,"Nice location, very noisy roooms.","we stayed for 4 nights, the last 2 nights were terrible.
We had neighbours who came in at 06.30 a.m and then started to make noise, they slept for one hour and then the noise started again and that 2 nights after each other. The people were surprised if we said something about it. They were very antisocial. The rooms are very noisy. Of course the hotel cannot do anything about those people...but maybe they can do something about the rooms...",3,2017,05,02
60,Janet & linda,"Stayed here for a break and sightseeing. The rooms were a little tired but spotless ,linen and towels changed daily . The staff were friendly and helpful. The location couldn't have been better , will certainly stay here again",4,2017,04,30
60,Nice hotel in great location,The hotel is in the middle of the ramblas. I've been there with my family and my parents. The rooms where with a view to the ramblas (recommended) my room was for 3 beds and it was big. My parents room on the 3rd floor for 2 and was ok. The breakfast was tasty without too many options!! Attached the view from the balcony to the ramblas,5,2017,04,29
60,"Location, location, location",Lovely grand old hotel in need of TLC but the location can not be better. Everything you want to see and do is within walking distance which makes up for a lot. I had a room overlooking La Rambla which I would recommend. However the room was cold and no heating available. The wifi kept dropping out. Breakfast was quite ok but you can get better out and about. There are many fabulous restaurants and bars just a wander away from the hotel. The room was clean and I found the housekeeper to be very nice. Plenty of hot water.  The public areas could do with a spruce up. It's expensive for the facilities they offer but the location is what you're paying for. Three stars for the hotel and an extra one for location. Would I stay there again? Probably but I would search a bit first to look for better value for money.,4,2017,04,28
60,Very good option in Barcelona Excellent located,"We stayed only a couple of nights in Barcelona (too short for such a wonderful city). The location was excellent to get easily (walking or using local transportation) and in short time the main attractions of the city. The hotel premises are excellent. Rooms and aisles are vey big ,clean and full of light. the building is old and has been wonderfully restored. The staff was very kind and cooperative at every moment.  We did not use the hotel food plans but you  have plenty of bars and restaurants around. We strongly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,04,28
60,Basic but excellent location,"Although hotel is basic, rooms we were in were hot with temperature controls broke. It is clean and tidy and you can't fault the location smack bang in the middle of the ramblas. Ideal for a stag party just after somewhere to put their heads!",3,2017,04,26
60,Wonderfully situated,"Situated on La Rambla meant we could walk to many of the sights. The Aerobus stop was also within easy walking distance so made transfer really easy. Our room was large (big enough for a family room) and very clean. Although we overlooked La Rambla we were not bothered by noise. Breakfast was OK but would have been better if the hot food had been hot and if butter had been available everyday - but the breakfast space is bright, airy and spacious.",4,2017,04,22
60,Not the worst...,"We've been in a very big room, with plenty of space for us and our two children. The balcony was directly on the Rambles, so the room was slightly noisy. The price was not cheap but, hey, this is Barcelona and Les Rambles. What can you expect on price??
The staff was nice, but on the breakfast they were overloaded with the quantity of people. The breakfast is, simply, correct.
In brief, well located, good hotel, but you're paying the location, not the hotel.",4,2017,04,21
60,"Excellent, as usual!","I've been at Oriente many times, and this hotel has never disappointed me. The service is always amazing. And I really love the breakfast. I always ask for a room with a view on the Rambla. The locaction of this hotel can't be more central. And the rooms are spacious and clean. I can't wait to return...",5,2017,04,18
60,Nice little trip to Barca :),"Stayed here for a few days in October last year. Hotel was nice, love the interior design. Breakfast was pretty plain, could of been more options. Great location, the nightlife is really good here. It was a good holiday :) ",5,2017,04,15
60,If you want central this is it,"Stayed at this hotel for one night before going on a cruise. Nice clean room but some street noise which you get at any hotel on the ramblas. Excellent staff throughout the hotel, took care of our luggage which was safe and secure and not accessible to the public. Excellent breakfast lots to choose from, hot or cold. Will use this hotel for future trips to Barcelona.",5,2017,04,14
60,"Architecturally stunning, Barcelona has so much to offer the visitor","Architecturally stunning, Barcelona has so much to offer the visitor. Centrally located on La Ramblas, the Oriente Atiram puts you at the heart of the Catalonian experience. The accommodation ranges from the comfortable to the spacious. It also offers rooms with views over the Ramblas or, alternatively, quiet accommodation. The rooms are spotlessly clean and the staffs are pleasant and helpful: if you have a problem, query or ask for local advice, nothing seems to be too much trouble. The buffet breakfasts are copious, well presented and varied. 

Out and about, you can find such a diverse choice of food from ‘foodie’ snacks, local Tapas and gastronome restaurants. The choice of attractions are just as wide-ranging; unless you know exactly where and what you want to see, I would recommend that you ‘hop on’ one of the tour busses to take a peek at what you might like to visit at length later. Or, alternatively, go adventuring on foot. If retail therapy is your thing, the shops that surround La Ramblas area are within walking distance and should satisfy all fashion and couture tastes. From the sublime ancient back alleyways of the Gothic quarter to the contemporary and chic harbour-side bars, Barcelona offers the perfect city break. I do have one conundrum however, when walking on La Ramblas, whether going up towards Catalonia Square or down to the harbour at Port Vell, I always seem to be walking in the opposite direction to everyone else!",5,2017,04,12
60,Great location,"Spent 4 nights at hotel in April 17.

Room was small but very clean on side of building with small balcony.

If you want a central location for las Ramblas this is perfect, but streets can be noisy at night.

Staff very helpful and friendly and breakfast was very good.

Only negative was the pillows - only one supplied for each bed and when we requested some additional ones, were told none available.

Would definitely recommend.",4,2017,04,12
60,"Location, Location, Location!","When I booked this hotel it was purely based on the convenient location on Las Ramblas, as a 3* I wasn't sure what to expect. However I was pleasantly surprised and in my opinion this is more of a 4* hotel. From the outside it doesn't look too big but as soon as you go in there is a maze of floors and rooms. You can see all the original architecture that has been integrated into the renovated modern design. 

The location could not be any better and for this alone is worth a stay. In the middle of Las Ramblas and a 2 minute walk to the metro you can walk into the Gothic Quarter in no time, the famous food market is 2 minutes away, the port or head up to the top of Las Ramblas into the shopping district. We used taxis to go to Park Guell and La Sagrada Familia, this cost around 6 euros per trip. For other areas we used the metro very easily. 

The rooms are basic but modern, perfectly adequate for a city break where you do not spend an awful amount of time in the room, more of a comfortable place to sleep. The beds were not the comfiest but the pros of this hotel far outweigh any negatives. Check in and out was very quick and easy and the staff were friendly, we were given a city map on arrival. The wifi was very good and we had no problems connecting and the speed was good. 

I have stayed in Barcelona several times before and usually have stayed at the 5* Bagues Hotel just up the road, however I would certainly stay here again for a nice, easy base in a beautiful city!",5,2017,04,11
60,week break in barcelona,"Great hotel in prime position on La Rambla, ideal for all the main tourist attractions. Were given a lovely room on the 3rd floor with Juliet balcony overlooking the Rambla.
Continental breakfast included in the price which provided a good selection and was ideal to start the day off with.
Would certainly stay here again and will be recommending it to all of our friends and family.",4,2017,04,06
60,My birthday weekend/ last day of hell,"I read a lot of mix review about this place and decided to try it for my self. We have been to Barcelona before and wanted to go back, our main reason was for the farmer market on las rambas. (Amazing place ) and the shopping.

We chose this hotel as it is right on las rambas and is the Center to everything, Shops, restaurants, and bus line and metro link to and from airport. 

On arrival we were greated by staff they were ok I had ask for a quite room as I heard the not so quite room can be loud. Room was ok out dated but it did the trick. We were only in town from fri to Sunday so it was jus somewhere to lay our heads.  If we stay long I prob would have chose a much more update hotel. It had basic,a very small flat screen t v a hair dryer and a min bar with nothing in it.   

The doors do slam hard and it can get annoying a lot when ur trying to sleep and every 2 min a door slam.

On the last day we were waiting in our hotel to leave and we decried to charge our phones while we wait. I told my husband I going to the lady's and I'll be back. As I walk in to the toilets on the first floor near there breakfast reasturnat I couldn't fine a light so as I walk in they had lights in the cubical I shut the door lock it and went about my business a few min later the lights went OFF I got up try to switch the light on in side the toilet it wouldn't  come on I'm in the pitch black now I unlock the door and try to get out the door still lock I can't get out I have no phone and don't know what to do. I'm screaming at the top of my voice help help no one comes  im banging on the door like a mad woman noone there none around as the toilets are far in the comer and the restaurant not open. Some how what seem like hours the light switch flickers and I mange to open the door and run down stairs crying to my husband telling him what happen. Some how I think they have a system where they save energy and everything shut down!!! 
  I JUST WANTED To LEAVE!!!! 
The reception area was busy full of people coming in I was in no mood to talk to anyone after that. 

",1,2017,04,04
60,Central location but noisy,"Our room was on the first floor at the front of the Hotel looking out on La Rambla which is always very busy and bustling. The room had double glazed doors but unfortunately ours was warped at the top so did not seal and subsequently it could get very noisy at night and into the early hours. The room 112 is also above the foyer which meant a lot of noise traveled up the grand staircase to the rooms along that corridor.
Staff very courteous and helpful and the rooms were kept spotless the complimentary soft drink mini bar was stocked daily and included bottled water, chocolate bar and crisps.
Breakfast was very good also with a hot and cold choice of food and cereals and pastries were readily available. On the down side I had on several occasions chipped and cracked mugs on my place serving.
Would I go back? Yes but I would ask for a room on the higher floors.",3,2017,04,02
60,Good value for money,Nice clean rooms with everything you need in a location that keeps you in the mix of things in Barcelona. The breakfast was great with a large selection available. Would have appreciated a tea and coffee making station in the room.,4,2017,04,02
60,Fair warning!,"The hotel was very clean. Breakfast was edible, however the ""hot"" food was only luke warm. Our room was on the first floor overlooking La Rambla, and although the reviews that we read before booking implied that the sound proofed glazing was very good, and would shut out the noise, it made no difference to us as our window wouldn't close flush! 

We booked the hotel safe in the knowledge that it had its own bar. Shame however that it wasn't open the whole week we were there!

My husband likes to go for an early morning run. Imagine his surprise when within the first five minutes on his first attempt, he was approached by two men asking if he was ""looking for exotic dancers"" and noticing on his return that a number of prostitutes had gathered around the entrance of our hotel!!!",3,2017,03,31
60,Hotel in an enviable position on Las Ramblas,"We have stayed in this hotel several times over the last three years.  The position on Las Ramblas is very convenient for the metro and just a short stroll from Playa Catalunya if taking the bus from the airport.

We stayed in a standard room overlooking a side street.  The rooms was very clean, although a little basic and we heard no noise from the other guests.

Since our visit last year the breakfast has been improved and there are themed foods on different days.

The staff are always very helpful and friendly and we will certainly return for our seventh visit in the near future.",4,2017,03,30
60,Birthday celebration ,"We stayed for 2 nights in the deluxe room which was clean and spacious! Bathroom had a bath which was needed after a long day of walking, also has fresh towels everyday. The room itself came with a free minibar that was topped up full everyday, we had a room facing the la ramblas which was noisy at times but I wasn't awful! Overall it would stay here again as it is right in the centre, most 4/5 star restaurants on trip advisor were between 2-6 minute walk from this hotel so it was perfect for us! Across the road is also a massive square full of restaurants and bars which is one of the nicest bits of the las ramblas, the noise shouldn't be a issue as your right near everything!",4,2017,03,29
60,"Location, location, location","My husband and I visited Oriente Atiram on a research assignment for a upcoming ""All Men's Group Holiday"" later in the year. It turned out to be exactly what we were looking for. It once was a Cloister (1842) and is now a lovely hotel with old and new touches. Our roof faced the famous Ramblas and while it is great during the day to look out the mini balcony at all the people below; at night you need to bring ear plugs (seriously) as many young people decide to come out, drink as much as they can and test their voices between midnight and 5am. The hotel offers thick glass doors and shutters but young people are LOUD. So beware. The breakfast room is a treat to behold and the food provided ""4 stars +++"". 

I highly recommend as it is within walking distance of many museums and places of interest. Well done and the people working at hotel are always helpful. Great Wifi in the room as well. ",5,2017,03,29
60,Nice Hotel would be 4 stars if breakfast was better,"The staff here are lovely. This is a friendly hotel. Rooms comfortable, no chairs though ! No English TV ! 
Breakfast is buffett - adequate but uninspiring.
Right at the action, so despite its little faults, it still ticks most of the boxes !",3,2017,03,29
60,Weekend Break,"Ideally situated in La Ramblas. Easy Airport Connection to Place Catalunya, then ten minutes walk. Local market, St. Josephs, was nearby. Good eating places in nearby Squares. The Marina is worth a visit also.
Relaxed attitude in Hotel, breakfast had cooked and Continental choice. Our room was large, clean and bed was comfortable. The balcony opened on to a side street. There was no noise overnight and our stay was a happy one.",4,2017,03,28
60,City break,"The room was quite nice and clean with a comfy bed. The breakfast offered in the hotel was delicious and the hotel was nice but it is located on a very busy street (La Rambla) and it is loud all the time (cars, tourists, metro) and you can hear very well people in the next room...",3,2017,03,27
60,My daughters 21st birthday trip to Barcelona,"Excellent hotel 
Brilliant location right in the heart of the gothic area
Hotel customer service excellent
Apart from 
Only one tiny mirror in bathroom 
A long mirror and a mirror over dressing table needed (especially when getting ready to go out for dinner)
Long mirror could go behind door or space on wall at door
Asked but answer was the rooms on level three had to be the same and all rooms only had a bathroom mirror 
Could not help me 
That's a shame because it would make such a difference in adding light and space

60,4 night city break with friends,"Staff very friendly. Shame no air-con in rooms in March as weather was very warm. Hotel bar closed but staff happy to let us bring drinks into reception area for late night game of cards.
Hotel was clean and tidy but rooms getting a bit 'tired' looking, laminate flooring damaged and water damage in bathrooms.
Overall though, we had a very relaxing time and would stay again 
Barcelona is one of our favourite cities to visit and relax.",4,2017,03,24
60,small room,"very small double room.

No fridge or tea making facilities, lovely staff, great location, very clean.",3,2017,03,23
60,Good stay,"Hotel was good and clean. Very good location near many attractions that you can go for a short walk. Walking distance to pubs, restaurants and for shopping. Staff speak good english and were helpfull.  ",4,2017,03,23
60,The Oriente and the Opera,"We only had one night here but it is memorable, just one block or less to the Gran Teatre Liceu to see the Opera.
Delightful staff, amazing breakfast room, light and airy and very a inviting place . 
The staff have plenty of time for you. Our room overlooked La Ramblas with a balcony, close to all that you want including the metro.",4,2017,03,23
60,WheelChair Traveller,Hotel Oriente is a great place to stay for anyone. It is right across from Placa Reial. The hotel was pretty accessible and very friendly. Great location to visit La Rambla st and the Gothic District and close to the metro.,4,2017,03,22
60,Served it's purpose to sleep and shower.,"We knew we would not be spending much time at our hotel being my family of 4 (2 adults 2 teens)wanted to see and do as much before embarking on our cruise. So we chose the oriente atrim for it's location which did not disappoint.   We checked in after 11pm and hotel desk serviced us well.  Tiny elevators we had to make 2 trips up with luggage.  Walls are paper thin and our neighbors did not appreciate our late arrival though.  Included breakfast was good lots of options.  Rooms were very small and in retrospect instead of a quad room we should have book adjoining doubles so my sons could have slept in a reg bed and not a sofa bed.  We were out and about all day and came back exhausted so the small room size did not bother us too much.  Our room faced the side street and even with door closed and air on noisy from garbage trucks and people in street did wake us nightly.  However, we just loved walking outside and being right on Las Ramblas in the middle of the action.  There were so many dining options at our fingertips and sadly we did not find the awesome hidden courtyard across the street until our last day.  Upon check-out we had our luggage held and explored the boqueria and more of the gothic quarter and returned to get our luggage and had a very quick cab ride to the port to board our ship.  If you are looking for a great location and just need the basics then this is the place for you, if you need even some slight hotel luxury look elsewhere cause this is a simple basic hotel.",3,2017,03,22
60,Appalled by the treatment towards their paying guests,"We booked this hotel on Friday 17th March - we booked at the reception as we were actually in another hotel and looking to move on.  We were given one of their superior rooms - clean and tidy-nothing superior about it.  There was a bit of noise the first night which we expected as we were on Las Ramblas.  However we did not expect or were we advised of the staff party on the evening of the 18th March.  We had very loud music and singing until after 02:30 - this took place about 25 yards from the room we were TRYING to sleep in.  I was horrified that they would contemplate having a staff party when there are PAYING guest in the hotel whose main aim at night is to SLEEP.  I complained in the morning to the two young chaps at the reception - we were offered a free breakfast by one of them - whcih we had to decline as we felt sick from lack of sleep, the othere young chap at the reception should no interest at all.  I would definately not recommend this hotel as you never know if you are going to get a sleep or not",3,2017,03,22
60,What a lovely hotel,"Just got back from a 2 night stay in this wonderful old hotel.Right in the heart of la Ramblas ...the staff were more than helpful and the room was spotless.we had a basic double room and it was more than adequate,it was also equipped for disabled with lifts to all floors,the room itself had a wet room with a shower chair if you have difficulties standing and a rail next to the toilet for help.you had clean towels every day and also a hairdryer and safe in the rooms,with a tv in each room ...not that it's needed when you stay 😊 We had breakfast the morning we left and there was a range of fresh fruit,hams,cheeses ,salami,cereals fresh orange juice and bottomless coffee.also fresh rolls,bread and full English ..as far as buffets go it was excellent..there was also a range of pastries to top it off.check out was at 12 and there is a locked room to keep your luggage if you have a late flight.would have loved to have stayed longer and will definitely be returning to this hotel.although the hotel was on the busiest street the noise level inside was excellent .",5,2017,03,22
60,Good and Bad,"We are a family of four that booked a large family suite and when we showed up during the same weekend of the Barcelona Marathon we were directed to a very small room with a king  bed and a pull out sofa. The room was definitely dated, well worn, not very clean and stunk of smoke. Since it didn't look even remotely similar to the room that I had booked we asked for a change and was given a better room, slightly larger, cleaner and a had balcony. The bathroom was cramped for even one person but it was still better than the first room. We left the hotel for 3 days and returned on our way home and this time we were given the room that I had actually booked. Large, updated decor and bathroom, high ceilings and balcony over Las Ramblas. This room we were happy with but I do feel taken by the first rooms we were given, I can only assume they were very full due to the Marathon and we were bumped to a smaller room.
I have stayed a several hotels on Las Ramblas which were very nice but also much more expensive. So it really comes down to you get what you pay for. The foyer was very dated and in separate need of a makeover, the breakfast was OK with the exception of the coffee which was not drinkable but the machine did do hot chocolates which my daughter liked.
Convenient location to many bars and restaurants and a 15 minute walk from Plaza Catalunya where you can get the Aerobus to/from the airport.",3,2017,03,21
60,Lovely Break,"I booked a 5 night break to celebrate my birthday.  The location was perfect being close to the Metro, Gothic Quarter and port area.

We had a room on the 3rd floor overlooking the breakfast atrium which was very peaceful.  Although not huge the room had everything we needed.  We couldn't get the air-con to work properly but to be honest weren't that bothered and I am sure if we had asked, it would have been sorted.

Breakfast was fine.  The hot option included bacon, sausages and scrambled eggs but I preferred the fresh fruit, yoghurt and pastries.  There was also a couple of breakfast cereals, cheeses and cold meats so enough choice for most people. Every day there was also a ""special"" in Catalan Corner which was a nice touch.

The staff were all very pleasant and on my birthday they left a bag of sweets in my room which was a thoughtful gesture.

The only slight niggle was our room card failed to work on 3 occasions.

All in all I would recommend this hotel for a great stay.",4,2017,03,19
60,Good and bad ,Stayed here for 4 nights and had an amazing time in Barcelona but.... this hotel has some positives and negatives I will start with the positives the wifi is amazing high spend once signed in the power shower in the bathroom was also amazing and the best positive of all was the location you can't get more in the action and central how ever the negatives as follows... we had dirty towers everyday with marks on them the hotel also could be noisy at night and we didn't have air con it had been taken out our room we had to have our window open all night just to cool down on our booking it said our room would have air con I would definitely say this hotel is more like a 2* star definitely needs improvement and a revamp ,2,2017,03,17
60,Great Hotel in an excellent location,"The hotel was in an excellent location - you walk out the front door and straight onto Las Ramblas and it is practically across the road from the gothic quarter.  Our room was very spacious and clean with the sheets, towels in the bathroom (which was also very spacious) being changed daily.  The breakfast was a buffet style with always plenty to eat - the usual bacon and eggs but also fruit, yogurt etc.  The hotel reception staff were very helpful and we actually booked the open top bus tour from Reception at a slightly cheaper price.  The hotel is also only a short walk down to the Marina/harbour which has lots of lovely restaurants and bars.  Would not hesitate to stay in this hotel again.",5,2017,03,17
60,Great Hotel,"The hotel was clean upon entering.  I was created immediately by the girl that worked the desk who was very nice and helpful.  We arrived early and she was able to accommodate us with a room right away.  The breakfast was the standard breakfast and was worth it.  The only thing I would have change is we had a room on the first floor facing Las Ramblas and I really wished we would have changed it because it gets very, very loud from the people parting in the streets all night. But that is not the hotel's fault.  The hotel is within walking distance to just about everything.  I would definitely stay here again, just not on the first floor and not facing Las Ramblas.  The view from my romeo/juliet balcany was good.",5,2017,03,13
60,Short break with my wife,"After a few very stressful months at work I had the pleasure of spending 5 nights at this beautiful hotel situated in the very heart of La Ramblas. Staff approachable  and very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them. We arrived on the friday and were allocated a room but it was rather claustrophobic, it was still a very nice room. Spoke to the duty staff and explained the issue and asked for an alternative room, I was prepared to pay for an upgrade. They immediately offered me an upgrade to a balcony room overlooking La Ramblas at no additional cost. 

The hotel is nicely decorated and very clean, the room was well serviced every day and the domestic staff very friendly. The location is ideal, literally a 5 minute walk from Liceu metro stop and the entire transfer by train to the City to 55 minutes and one change at Passiage De Gracia. We are already planning our next visit and this hotel is the only one I will be considering.",5,2017,03,13
60,very Expensive No facilities,"we paid 2500 Euro for 3 nights but our room was Very typical and simple.
- location was good
- staff were good
- but our room didn't have any Facilities.
- there were no socket in any other side of the bed. and you couldn't work with mobile when you were in bed.
- there isn't any Convex Mirror.
- the our room didn't have a good View. our view was Roof Restaurant.
- our room wasn't suitable for a woman. you can't do make-up because the mirror was one side and the table was other side.( table and mirror weren't beside each other) the light wasn't Enough for make up.
- it wasn't any Slippers, comb, 

- it wasn't suitable for disabled people because there was many step in corridor.
- the Breakfast of restaurant was good but the restaurant was apathetic.
-  the furniture of lobby were old .

60,"Central Location, but...","This hotel has a lot of pluses: it is well located on Las Ramblas and very close to Plaça Reial in the Gothic Quarter. We had a nice room overlooking Las Ramblas, we enjoyed a nice breakfast served every morning from 7-11, and then there's Joseph, one of the nicest and most helpful front desk people ever. He was excellent offering advice on what to see and do, good places to eat, getting us a taxi, all those things that go above and beyond. And now the bad... the beds are awful. There was a pair of twin beds on metal frames with poor mattresses. The linens were coarse and the pillows thin and poor quality. The bathroom had a bad smell (like sewer gas) and it was fixed. There's no place to set anything in the bathroom, no counter, no hooks on the walls, no grab bar in the very narrow tub, no wash cloths, no kleenex. It was hard to get a decent night's sleep because of the bed quality and the noise coming from all the partiers on Las Ramblas. All in all not a hotel that was very comfortable and the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because of Joseph.",3,2017,03,06
60,70th birthday stay,"The room was very clean, spacious with a fantastic view of La Ramblas! It is a must to ask for a view of this famous street in Barcelona. Central to all shops, restaurants, harbour and amazing indoor market. Would definitely go back to this very friendly and wonderfully located hotel.",5,2017,02,27
60,Clean and central,"This hotel was clean and nicely situated close to both the city center and the marina.
Breakfast was good and well assorted with both yoghurt and bread (and pastries for the sugar-liking:-)).

But the beds were SO horrible :-(
And the wifi was also working very bad.",3,2017,02,26
60,BRILLIANT!,"We were upgraded from another Atiram hotel at no extra cost due to renovation works. We stayed here with our 3 year old son and had an amazing time. Great location, walking distance to many attractions, clean rooms, friendly staff and good breakfast. Rooms are spacious with good size wardrobes and a safety locker. Would highly recommend.",5,2017,02,26
60,Excellente,"Exceptional hotel smack in the middle of Las Ramblas, Metro just 2 minutes walk, Pl. Real 5 minutes walk for lovely restaurants.
The rooms were spacious in size, spotless with veranda overlooking Las Ramblas.
Breakfast served in a lovely atrium.  We did have an issue with breakfast when we booked the holiday with breakfast included, this confirmed at check-in however every morning told we had to pay, we didn't take breakast on the last day.  Breakast was good with plenty of choice.
The staff at this establishment are to be commended, nothing was a problem to any of them, this made our stay that little more comfortable.  Definite YES YES for us.",4,2017,02,22
60,Fantastic central hotel,"This is a great hotel, centrally situated. The Ramblas I imagine could be noisy if you have a room at the front, but as we weren't it was very peaceful. The staff were all lovely, helpful and attentive, whether they were front of house or housekeeping.
We were staying in 3 double standard rooms, all of which were clean and had everything you needed. The whole of the hotel was exceptionally clean and was all in the process of being refurbished. 
We didn't book breakfast in the hotel, from reading other reviews we decided to breakfast out, the breakfasts in the hotel did look good, but were very pricey, you could find some very reasonable bars and cafes serving breakfast close to the hotel at a fraction of the price.
We would certainly stay at this hotel again, as we certainly intend to return to Barcelona.",5,2017,02,22
60,Best Hotel  in Barcelona,"Our room was cleaned every day, confortable beds, beautiful room. Everybody was smiling and helpful. The Hotel is in the heart of Barcelona.We didnt eat there, but if we came next time we definitely will try their restaurant part!",5,2017,02,21
60,good service and great location,"The location was great! Our rooms was not located out to La Rambla - so no noise at night. 
Nice and clean room with plenty of space.  Super breakfast, a lot to choose among. The hotel service was also good.",4,2017,02,19
60,Well Placed and Friendly Hotel,"This is a clean and comfortable hotel well placed in the centre of town. Our room over looked las Ramblas and was very good. The staff were very friendly and helpfull. There was not much in the way of services, for example the bar seemed closed. However there are plenty of places for drinking and eating nearby.",4,2017,02,15
60,Wonderful stay,"The hotel is clean ,comfortable beds and great location.The staff were really helpful and polite .Explaining things clearly and giving clear directions.A central location in the thick of it .We would go back and stay here .",4,2017,02,14
60,Great location and good value,"Nice hotel right in the middle of la Rambla. Spacious rooms were quite comfortable (although not the freshest decor), spacious and clean. Nice bathroom with a good sized tub. Oversized plush bath towels were a real plus. Included breakfast was quite extensive: eggs, a variety of cold cuts and cheese, lots of different kinds of bread, fresh fruit, yogurt, croissants and various other pastries, cereal and fruit juices. Coffee, unfortunately, was from a machine, but not bad. Only negative things to say about the place is that there was only one English language television station we could find on the TV and it was RT (Russian Television) news -- basically, the Kremlin's propaganda network -- which was kind of funny, but I'm getting more than a little tired of fake news and would have preferred CNN or BBC. Also, to get a key to lock the in-room safe required a 10 euro deposit. Otherwise, though, I'd say this place offers good value, considering the reasonable price and the excellent/convenient location.",4,2017,02,13
60,Great location,"The Hotel is in a great location on La Rambla, only a 2 minute walk to Liceu metro stop. 

Bars and restaurants are on the doorstep. 

We had a twin room and it was a decent size, the bathroom looked recently refurbished and was very clean. 

The beds were slightly too hard but not unbearable. 

Staff were friendly and very helpful. 

Overall it's a really nice hotel in an even better location. ",4,2017,02,13
60,"Ignore bad reviews, this is good value for money. We'll be back!",We asked for a room overlooking La Ramblas and got our wish.No additional charge was applied for this. Beds were comfortable enough and room size was more than adequate.Welcome /check in at reception was both friendly and efficient.There was daily cleaning of the room with fresh towels and toiletries supplied. The breakfast room was located on the first floor of the hotel and was both airy and light. A selection of hot and cold dishes was available daily as was a good selection of pastries and fresh fruit or whatever else you may fancy. Waiting staff were both friendly and helpful clearing up tables as they became available. Some reviews have stated that the daily purvey is repetitive but you do not have to choose the same food each day as there is a good variety to choose from.Given the location and the cost of our stay here the Oriente Atirum represents good value for money. I recommend a stay here and a return visit is most likely.,5,2017,02,12
60,Wouldn't call it a hotel.,The beds were so uncomfortable. You can feel every single spring in the bad and actually hear the sound they make while you move. No way to get mini fridges into your room even if you are open to pay a daily fee for it. No complimentary water and they actually refused to serve water to our room at 11PM and I had to go out of the hotel to buy water. No room service menu in the room as well. Terrible.,2,2017,02,08
60,fabulous staff and lovely hotel,"I have just returned home from a 6 night stay at the Oriente Atiram. The location was amazing as well the desk staff, right on La Rambla, only a short walk from Liceu metro station. We stayed in a family room which was clean and spacious. The staff were really lovely and helpful. when i asked them to keep my luggage after check out time till 5 PM they were welcomed with big smile, The breakfast was superb. really i will come again to Barcelona and stay at Oriente Atiram!",5,2017,02,05
60,Enjoyable stay,"We stayed in a Las Ramblas room at the front of the hotel. We were disappointed to find it was a twin room after requesting a double when we booked but it was not the end of the world.  The room was well decorated and the beds comfortable. Even though we were at the front of the hotel we heard very little noise from outside in the street. Despite being on the 4th floor we could feel the vibration from the metro underneath but it was not really a problem and we soon became used to it and did not really notice it. 

Breakfast was a varied choice and we never left feeling hungry. Staff were very helpful. Ideal location on Las Ramblas for tourists and reasonably priced. ",5,2017,02,04
60,Nice hotel,Just returned after a 4 day city break to Barcelona for my wife's birthday  stayed at the oriente perfect location on la rambla nice hotel great staff  whilst we were out on my wife's birthday the staff left balloons on the bed and a message on the mirror made my wife's day great hotel fantastic staff  would definately stay here again ,4,2017,02,04
60,"Loved my stay in Barcelona, would come back again","I have just returned home from a 4 night stay at the Oriente Atiram.  The location was amazing, right on La Rambla, only a short walk from Placa Catalunya where we were dropped off by the Aerobus.  There was a bit of noise at night but that's to be expected with the Hotel situated on La Rambla. We stayed in a triple room which was clean and spacious.  The staff were really lovely and helpful.  I even received a gift from them on my birthday!  The breakfast was superb.  Can't wait for my next trip to Barcelona!",5,2017,02,01
60,"Great location, clean and comfortable","We went for a weekend city break in January.  This hotel was ideal for us.  It has a great location.  We had a Rambla deluxe room which was very clean and comfy.  The staff were very friendly.  Get a deluxe room as you get tea/coffee making facility and an inclusive mini-bar with soft drinks, water and snacks.  Breakfast was excellent with a very good, fresh choice.  There is no restaurant or bar in the hotel but there are so many places on the doorstep it really wasn't a problem for us.  We will definitely return to Barcelona and the Oriente again.",4,2017,02,01
60,Fabulous staff and breakfast ,"We arrived on King's Day, and the lovely lady at desk asked if we celebrated King's Day in America. I commented that it's common in New Orleans and not in Seattle.

This gave the desk staff the ""excuse"" they needed to whisk a large king's bread in front of us, and implore us to take a piece. The bread was amazing with a custard filling (I'm drooling thinking about it)!

Then they decided we needed to take a picture with them as a momento of the day. We were flattered with the attention... and the personalized greetings we received throughout our 3-day stay at the hotel.

While small, our room was lovely with toiletries with fun sayings printed on them, pretty wallpaper, comfortable bed, and more.

The location of the hotel is fabulous for sightseeing, dining, and catching the metro to surrounding neighborhoods. 

Our stay at the Oriente Atiram definitely enhanced our visit to Barcelona!

60,New Years Eve in Barcelona!,"This hotel is perfectly located to really enjoy the beautiful, lively Ramblas. The architecture of the building is stunning, a real landmark on the Ramblas, I would suggest the best looking hotel!
Inside the reception is a little disappointing, I was expecting something a little more decorative, but a big plus is the friendly helpful reception staff. Our room was not ready as we arrive earlier than the check in time ,but we were able to leave our cases in their care.
We upgraded to a room overlooking the Ramblas, it was a lovely room on the 4th floor,very comfortable a with French doors which opens to a Juliet balcony looking down into the hustle and bustle of the Ramblas. The street is busy, really busy but when the doors are closed there is very little street noise. A small point, we paid 6 euros for a fruit basket to be placed in the room, this was a bit of a disappointment, it wasn't very good, a couple of clementines, apples and 2 bananas, just a block away is the fabulous fruit market where you can purchase a huge variety of beautiful fresh fruit, think the hotel could have done better. Breakfast was well presented, only one criticism , the hot breakfast wasn't always hot.Continental selection was excellent.
New Year's Eve in Barcelona is great, a real family atmosphere with lots of restaurants open before and after midnight. We walked to Plaza Espana to watch the manic fountains and then the fireworks. There was a heavy police presence, but we felt very safe. Great place to start the new year.
The weather was a little cooler than I was expecting, diffinately needed a coat for the evening.
We would book this hotel again for our next visit to Barcelona ,it is so perfectly placed",4,2017,01,28
60,Convience without Pretensiousness.,"I wanted a clean, comfortable hotel that let me get away from my busy life. The location is superb and the staff was super-friendly and totally helpful. Oh, the lobby is small and the view is unspectactular, but it is what I wanted.   ",4,2017,01,26
60,Great location ,"Stayed here in January with a friend. We got the aerobus to central Barcelona, hotel was easy to find from there, down the busy las rambles. Location is excellent, close to lots of attractions and near a wealth o restaurants and pubs. Our room was  basic, nice and clean, we were situated at the back of the hotel so didn't have any noise. Bathroom looked like it had been newly renovated, water from the shower leaked on the floor though. Reception staff were friendly and welcoming ",4,2017,01,26
60,Lovely hotel ,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights and it was lovely. 
The room was great,  overlook La Rambla. We asked for a street view room. 
The staff were very friendly and more than helpful. 
As it was January with January weather,  I didn't think the bedding would be warm enough for me,  so I asked reception for extra blankets and they arrived within 2 minutes. 
We didn't stay for breakfast but the dining room was beautifully set out. 
We would certainly stay here again. ",5,2017,01,26
60,"Good service and location, room below par","This hotel is in an amazing location right in the heart of the main tourist area and is very close to two metro stations. The front desk staff was friendly and tried their best to accommodate us, but overall, this isn't a hotel I would generally recommend.

My friend and I reserved a room with two single beds (Standard Twin Room). We were originally assigned to a room in the middle of the hallway (literally) with a fake window. There was no sunlight, the entire room (floor and walls) was concrete and the beds were hard. I'm glad that the hotel was able to accommodate our complaint and move us to a nicer room with one double bed. However, the original room should NOT have been available for rental to guests and the replacement wasn't that great. We were especially disappointed because we had booked directly with the hotel rather than through a third-party site. Plus, we had just stayed in an amazing room in a good location in Madrid at a cheaper price point. 

The room was not very modern and did not have the standard amenities you would expect. I recognize that travelling in Europe is different than North America, but we weren't even able to get an iron. We would have had to pay for laundry service. Also, the shower area in our new room was so small that it was almost impossible not to wet the floor and/or drop your shower products on the ground.

Overall, the hotel was very old fashioned, but served its purpose. Although the location was amazing, I wouldn’t want to book there again if I could help it.",3,2017,01,25
60,Location Location Location ,"Considering the price I paid, I expected a lower standard of hotel. I was wrong and had a very good experience at this hotel. Check in staff were friendly and check in and out process was simple. The room itself was decorated well and was clean. I had a room facing the main street however noise didn't seem to creep in which was a big bonus. I didn't have the breakfast as there was a lot of choice nearby. The location of the hotel is close to liceu station and is excellent for using as a base in Barcelona. ",5,2017,01,24
60,Friendly hotel in excellent location!,"We stayed in a family room from 12.1.17 until 15.1.17.  Our flight was delayed which meant that we checked in during the early hours.  The reception staff were very helpful and accommodating.
They provided directions when we needed it and advised which Line to take on the metro when visiting the Sagrada Familiar and Camp Nou.  Also advised which tickets to purchase.  They stored our suitcases on the last day after we had checked out, nothing was too much trouble.
Our room wasn't huge but was clean and functional.  We did hear some outside noise but fully expected this being in the middle of the city.
The location is great, the Metro station is virtually opposite, numerous bars and restaurants are in the immediate location plus the food market is across the road.  It is a 15 minute walk to the harbour and beach.",4,2017,01,18
60,HOTEL ORIENTALE ATIRAM,"The hotel is in a great location close to the port area , surrounded by shops and restaurants .The hotel was very clean  and the staff polite. The breakfast offers plenty of choice and is eaten in the glass roofed atrium which is very pleasant .Our room was spacious but did not have tea making facilities which some people prefer and as it was located at the front of the hotel it was quite noisy of a night but I am sure a room at the back of the hotel would be fine. This hotel was great value for money and I would definitely stay there again.",4,2017,01,17
60,A great central location with great service,"Great treatment by the staff, clean and comfortable accommodation, good servicing of the rooms, enjoyable and plentiful meals, and located right in the middle of the most interesting area of the city.",4,2017,01,15
60,Excellent location ,"The hotel is located on La Rambla close to Liceu Metro station, giving perfect access around the city at 1€ per journey. It is close to Plaça de Catalunya for the city tour bus and shops, a short walk from Port de Barcelona and a little further is the beach. 

Everyone at the hotel was extremely helpful and knowledgable, able to answer every question we asked. 

The 4th floor room overlooked La Rambla and there was a certain amount of noise at night, but that should be expected of a very busy city centre area. 

Breakfast provided a mix of English and Continental styles and there was certainly ample amounts of both. 

I'd recommend the hotel and would certainly stay there again. ",4,2017,01,15
60,Very central,"This hotel is in the best location to visit the center of Barcelona. Staff very helpful. Room was spacious. loved it was a walk away from the marina and the Mercat is just 2 blocks away. Metro station is just across the road. Restaurants are just on the doorstep, so much to choose from. Would go again.",5,2017,01,10

60,Great location ,"My husband and i stayed two nights for his 40th. On check in, the room we were allocated stank of cigarette smoke (i think someone had been smoking in the bathroom as apparently all rooms are non smoking) however, there were apparently no other rooms so had to make do with leaving the doors open for most the afternoon. Reception also said they would spray some air freshener whilst we went out for dinner.... If they did, i couldn't tell. The rest of the stay was fine, standard of room servicing was fine ( apart from the fag stench  that lingered most the weekend), hot water plentiful. The hotel is not able to lend you an iron so.if you do need to press anything, you need toallow 24 hours. It was easier to buy something new from Zara! 
We didn't go for breakfast as there is plenty of choice locally.

60,Amazing location,"My wife and I were staying at the hotel during the month of December, close to the new year.
3 star hotel located in a very central location - the middle of La Rambla, a distance of about five minutes walk from La Boqueria market.
The hotel's location just fine for anyone who wants to be the center.
Although we received a small room, but it does the job required.
Toilet and shower were very clean.
Wi-Fi was at a very good level.
Can be reached easily to one side of La Rambla - square Garcia or the other side of La Rambla - the port.
a few steps from the hotel there is a Metro station, providing access to all parts of the city of Barcelona.
 In summary, the hotel is recommended for anyone who wants to be the center of the city.",4,2017,01,07
60,Perfect Spot on La Rambla,"Let me start by complementing the hotel staff....all of them! Thumbs up!!!
Hotel is in an amazing spot on La Rambla. Rooms are spacious, clean and newly refurbished. 
Our check in was very quick and efficient. In no time we were in our room which was overlooking the Rambla. Bed is very comfy, showers very clean, and all basic amenities existed.
Whats so amazing about this hotel is its location. Next to Boqueria and  a few steps away from the Liceu Metro station.
Amazing price to quality ratio !!!!
We had an amazing stay at the hotel and would definitely recommend it and would most most most definitely stay it in again",5,2017,01,06
60,Chique Central & ease of getting about in Barcelona,"Have spent the New year here and was impressed with its beauty & uniqueness other friends stayed in modern rooms overlooking the front but where disturbed by the passing underground trains but we had a small room with a balcony overlooking the side street was very nice & quiet very comfy bed, linen changed daily & clean, staff very friendly, would recommend this Hotel, for a romantic getaway, and the street xmas lights best anywhere ever.",4,2017,01,06
60,Upgrade to a larger room,"Very reasonably priced hotel in a great location on La Ramblas.
However the rooms are TINY. I highly recommend an upgrade to a ""double deluxe"" room. Be sure to book a city view room otherwise you totally miss out on the atmosphere of La Ramblas. A warning - even the upgraded rooms are tiny and there is very little storage space for unpacking your suitcase. Another downside is that the beds are small and not very comfortable. The rest of our family did not have a problem with the beds. Maybe I got one with an older mattress.

On the upside, the hotel is very clean and well kept and the staff are very helpful.
Due to the location close to the wonderful Mercat  de la Boqueria and the metro station, I decided to give the hotel a four star rating.",4,2017,01,02
60,Good hotel,"Stayed from dec 21-27, 2016. Check in was quick and no issues. Hotel is perfectly placed in the heart of la rambla. Easy to get to any of the main sites from this hotel. Room was clean and in good shape. Had a balcony view of the rambla which is excellent. Noise from the street is minimal but noise from the metro underneath was evident. Overall had a real nice stay and would recommend this hotel as a convenient location with good amenities and good value. Great base to explore a great city.",4,2017,01,01
60,Citytrip in Barcelona,"Great location on La Ramblas. Very friendly and helpful staff. Great size room for city hotel.The facilities of the hotel were just fine and in line with the price of the room. They also have more updated rooms. The breakfast area looked really nice, rooms were cleaned daily, safe in the room.",4,2017,01,01
60,Great location,"Perfect location for exploring and staff very helpfull. Great size room for city hotel and the room was quite even which i did not expect as our room looked onto las ramblas. Highley recommend this hotel for location ,staff and value for money. Will return to this one.",5,2016,12,22
60,Weekend in Barcelona!,"This hotel is in such a great location! Balcony views in most of the rooms so get to see La Rambla in action! The noise from the main street really isn't so bad at all, I think there was more noise from hotel guests than from the actually street.

If yo are looking for a great priced, clean and ideally located hotel - this is it! Just across the street is the Gothic Quarter and just down one side is the port area, sea breeze and up the other end is the main square and fancy shops etc.

The facilities of the hotel were just fine and in line with the price of the room. They also have more updated rooms. The breakfast area looked really nice, rooms were cleaned daily, safe in the room, TV and the shower water pressure was brill!

The staff were great, polite, helpful and had a sense of humor!  I would stay here again any time!",4,2016,12,22
60,Birthday Visit,"This Hotel is situated in the heart of Las Rambals and is excellent value for money.  Rooms are clean and tidy, and cleaned every day.  No English TV though but who needs TV on a holiday!  The staff are very friendly and helpful.",4,2016,12,21
60,Short getaway from the cold and damp weather,"Great location right in the middle of tourist sight of La Rambla. Suitable for people who have difficulties in mobility but want to see the city sites on their own.
Hotel is accessible to places of interest, the famous market, hop on hop off buses and loads of restaurants at the doorstep.
Great for people who need to have their afternoon siesta and then off sightseeing and shopping after their rest.
Staff friendly and can speak English well.",5,2016,12,21
60,great hotel!!!!,"we stayed at Oriente Atiram for 4 nights, and we enjoyed every minute!

60,Great hotel!,"Good place!

60,Very nice Hotel,"The hotel is well located in the heart of everything , clean rooms , but extremely small for three , there was no space to walk around or between the beds, and very basic, no kettle or fridge and no English TV stations  ..
The staff were very friendly and helpful , and the breakfast was nice ..",4,2016,12,12
60,"Lovely hotel, excellent location, friendly staff and quite quiet (considering location)","Stayed 4 nights. We previously emailed and said we are Vegan and, if possible, please could we have a Vegan breakfast. On the first day the front desk hadn't told the kitchen, on the subsequent days they had arranged for a vegan breakfast. I had to go and buy my own soya milk though. We had a deluxe room overlooking the Ramblas. Very clean and well furnished. Very nice to have fridge stocked each day with soft drinks and snacks (all included). Great location to use for visiting the City and very easy to get to from the airport using bus or train. We will stay again when we come back to Barcelona.",4,2016,12,08
60,great staff - great location!,"great location - very clean room, good breakfast!

little bit noisy in the morning while the staff clean the other rooms in the same floor, I was trying to sleep little bit longer.

staff at the reception were very friendly and helpful with tourist questions.",5,2016,12,05
60,Hotel with perfect location,"Breakfast was good with varieties of food . The room was fine and clean but the beds was hard as  a stone and the television was small.

Hotel location at La Rambla was perfect close to almost everything.
Hotel staff was friendly and helpful.",4,2016,12,05
60,"Friendly, Helpful staff, great location in an elegant hotel","Very clean,  elegant hotel, friendly helpful staff, made us feel very welcome, large quiet room even though we were on the Main Street of Las Ramblas,which is a very central location and great for getting out and about to see the sites and catch the tour buses. We stayed room only, but plenty of places right on the doorstep to eat. Room was large, clean and loved the smiley, Ola face on bathroom mirror each morning, lovely touch. Visit the market during the day, left out of hotel short walk located on your left, the colour, sounds and smells are amazing! 
Great stay would definitely stay here again",5,2016,12,03
60,Good elevators,"The  hotel Oriente Atiram, located at las Ramblas 45, in Barcelona, cost  897 Euros for Tuesday through Friday, four nights.  The bill that came on my credit card, in dollars, was $1067.55.  The hotel has a no frills lobby and it’s a no frills hotel. There is free wi fi, but you must get the password from the desk. Check in is 2 pm, checkout is Noon.  There are a few steps going down  to the elevators from the lobby, but also a ramp. The bar is a bare room that I saw but did not use.  You cannot buy alcohol  in a store after 11 pm in Barcelona, but I think you can in a bar.  However, the bar in this hotel was not open late, as I recall. In Barcelona, maybe all of Spain, I don’t know, a glass of wine cost like 1.50 euros, which is very low compared to California.  There are 2 or 3 elevators and the wait is never very long.  A big group of French tourists came in while we were there.  The people at the desk are very nice and they remember who you are.  Sometimes they keep their head down, like hoping you won’t need anything as you pass by, and I didn’t blame them.  The “deluxe” room was 172 square feet.  It had a wardrobe closet on one side where you can hang up clothes, and ample space on a dressing table  to leave a suitcase open.  The room wasn’t exactly huge, but it was sufficient for two persons.  The bathroom with shower in a tub was fine.  I wanted to take a bath but there was no stopper.  We did not get the morning breakfast for 12 euros, but it looked ok as a buffet and the breakfast room was decorated quite cheerfully. The hotel was easy walking distance from the beach going one way, and easy walking to the Plaza Catalunya and department stores and money exchange by going the other. Down in front of the hotel  all along the middle of the street, are tables and chairs which belong to the restaurants along the sides of the street. These are very commercial and the food didn’t look very appetizing. Las Ramblas is very busy.  There is a constant crowd of tourists going all  up and down the street  and certainly in front of the hotel.  It reminded me of the crowds in Florence.  The winding historic streets that branch off Las Ramblas hold other hotels and front charming plazas here and there. The Picasso museum is just a few blocks away. The hotel Oriente is well known and located so you won’t get lost, as everyone knows  where it is if you lose your direction. The hotel was very good at communicating with me before we traveled there. To get there  from the airport, I made a mistake and took the subway , following some directions I found on Trip Advisor.  I could have more easily taken a bus from the airport directly to the plaza, and walked down to the hotel.. For me, the subway involved  too many changes and was crowded, and not easy with my suitcase, even though it was carry-on size with wheels. I didn’t find the subway exchanges or directionals clear.   Luckily I speak Spanish, so I could ask other passengers.",3,2016,12,01
60,Worst hotel in my life,"This is my worst experience in hotels. If the bed is not comfortable how do you think enjoy your stay. Just the location is very nice in the center of Rambla street, but every thing is bad. I will not come again for this hotel.",1,2016,11,29
60,"Friendly staff, great location, very noisy","It is hard for me to give a rating because I have mixed feelings about our recent stay.  The hotel was reasonably priced, clean, pretty modern, and the beds were comfortable.  That said, some amenities were lacking -- no refrigerator, coffee pot, hot water kettle, etc. The room also was extremely warm even with the thermostat turned off.  We tried opening our window to the balcony, but the noise level was too much.  The view outside our balcony was interesting, especially every night starting around 21:00 when you could watch the interaction of some ""working girls"" on the street corner -- yep, unexpected view. The interior walls also were very thin meaning that you could actually hear conversations from the adjoining room.  Breakfast was plentiful (Dessert pastries were excellent), staff once again were both friendly and helpful, but the eggs were runny to the point of almost being inedible.  There was a nice selection of sausage, fruit, juice and a coffee machine readily available. There was wifi available in our hotel room, but we experienced a noticeable degradation of service during Friday night and all day Saturday as compared to service during Thursday - Friday afternoon.  Once again, I must emphasize that the Hotel staff, Kitchen staff, and Cleaning staff were very friendly so in the end I guess I would recommend, just be sure to bring ear plugs.",4,2016,11,28
60,Perfect location .. friendly staff,"Our room window opened directly onto the Ramblas giving a great view but it was impossible to sleep with the noise and our room was too warm as there was no air conditioning available in the winter. The staff kindly obliged the following night with a fan which was a great help and meant we could keep the window shut. The hotel is in a perfect location for the seafront, the gothic quarter and the main shopping area. The hotel was spotless and our room was perfectly clean every day. 
We would definatley return. ",5,2016,11,26
60,Perfect location ,"Booked for 4 nights for a getaway with my partner. Perfect hotel in such an amazing location. We paid extra for a street view and I'm so glad we did, we spent so much time on the balcony watching the busy street of beautiful La Rambla. Staff were really polite and helpful, we got free water when we arrived and more later on. The rooms were cleaned to a good standard, bed was comfortable and we didn't have any issue with noise. As soon as the balcony doors were closed the street noise vanished. Lots of great places to visit in walking distance including the Gothic Quarter. Would definitely stay again",5,2016,11,25
60,ORIENTE  ATIRAM HOTEL,"Good POINTS  FRIENDLY staff  clean hotel  nice breakfast  and Wonderful location also great view from room .Bad points room small, air conditioning non existent, room so hot even in October left windows open , everything else in hotel very basic",4,2016,11,25
60,"Great staff, Great Posits on, Good stay .....up to a point!",Booked into two deluxe rooms with another couple. Rooms nice with balcony overlooking the busy Rambla. Beds and maid service very good and was nice just to cross the rold and find yourself in the Placa de Real which is a wonderfully elegant square. Breakfasted just opposite the hotel in one of the many cafés.  Staff were great especially Fernan whose English was very good and proved to be a boon as towards the end of my stay I took ill  and he called the doctor out. Had to change the hotel bed for a hospital one but Fernan helped my partner get through the trauma. Back home now and we'll again. Would like sometime to renew my acquaintance with the Oriente and finish the job off.,5,2016,11,24
60,"Great location, , tasty breakfast.","We spent three nights in Oriente Atiram and we had a great time. Hotel is located on the most famous street La Rambla. You are in the middle of everything interesting in Barcelona. If you want to smell real Barca atmosphere, this is your choice. You are close to metro station, close to bus station, close to Port, there is hundreds of different shops around you and hundreds of restaurants, so it is just up to you decision where to go first. Of course La Boqueria, most famous market is few meters from hotel. Even if you will have window straight to La Rambla, during the night we were not disturbed. I have to mention breakfast. Every day there is some special taste of Spain on separated table, which will start your day perfectly. Despite of that there is generous selection of all you need for breakfast. Room service was always done and rooms are valued for the money you pay. There is selection of tea and coffe in the room too. Once again, if you want to experience real Barca atmosphere and if you are looking for good value place, dont hesitate and visit Oriente Atiram.",5,2016,11,23
60,"Great location, value for money","We booked a triple room for 7 nights. The room was spacious, clean and tidy. Breakfast was good with a reasonable selection of bread, cheese, fruits and beverages. Service was great and staff (housekeeping, reception, breakfast crew) were friendly and courteous. Location of the hotel is strategic, easy access to Metro Station, less than 5 mins walk. Surrounded by a wide variety of restaurants and walking distance to numerous tourist attractions. Since it is a main tourist area, it can be a bit noisy for those who are light sleeper, especially for those whose room are facing the main street. Will definitely return to hotel in our next trip.",5,2016,11,22
60,Location perfect for sightseeing ,"In the heart of la rambla, you can walk outside and in 2minutes find all kinds of restaurants, shops,banks,entertainment and transportation.. with numerous taxis available outside the door. The room was very basic and small but clean with a nice bathroom and ""French door balcony""   I arrived 2hrs prior to check in time and was given immediate access to room which I appreciated. ",4,2016,11,22
60,Great location and modern,"Stayed here in October prior to a repositioning cruise. In the middle of Las Ramlas. We stayed on the 4th floor. New windows and suprisingly quiet on a very busy street. Room was totally new and modernized, as was the washroom. Not large by North America standards but would recommend it.",4,2016,11,19
60,good 3 star,"very good 3 star hotel,great location,everything on your doorstep,bars/restaraunts/shops.room clean/tidy/spacious,good night sleep,shower room,good/clean towels daily.plenty of wardrobe/draws for clothes.staff very friendly and helpful,good english.never ate/drank in hotel,but other guests did reccomend.plenty to eat at breakfast,usual fare,good spanish ommelettes.enjoyed our visit,would stay at this hotel again.",4,2016,11,19
60,Great hotel in busy central location,"Very pleasant hotel with friendly, helpful staff at a very competitive price.  Large room with comfortable beds and balcony.  Stayed in mid-November but room always comfortably warm.  Lovely bathroom with plenty of hot water.  Room cleaned everyday, but only when you put the notice on the door.  If you use the do not disturb notice you will not be disturbed.  This is right on La Rambla and so in easy walking distance of many of the main sites.  For this reason, although the rooms are double glazed, there will be street noise and slight vibration from the metro.  Bring earplugs or look for a hotel in a quieter location.",5,2016,11,18
60,A review of the outdoor restaurant,"One of many such facilities along La Rambla . All seem to have similar menus - very simple selections .As a tourist , you stop at these restaurants - not for great food & service but for a rest and to people watch . We got what we paid for .",2,2016,11,17
60,Perfect location,"We have just returned from a fantastic 4 days in barcelona.

This hotel is in the perfect location for people wanting to explore the city and see all the sights. The hotel is in the centre of las ramblas and all the main sights are with in a 10-20 minute walk to your left or right. 

Despite being on the strip which is noisy at night, the hotel rooms are suprisingly quiet and keep noise out well, we were on the front side of the hotel on the 2nd floor (room201).

Getting a taxi from the airport to the hotel was so easy and cost no more than €30. We also got a taxi to the camp nou football stadium from the hotel which cost around €15.

The hotel rooms are clean with a nice bath and shower, hotel staff are friendly and helpful. Check in was quick and easy when we arrived. When checking out there is a small city tax charge.

I cant believe this hotel is only 3 stars, definatetly feels like a 4 star and we would be more then happy to stay again when we go back to barcelona.

Thank you for a lovely stay

John Franklin and Megan Harper",5,2016,11,17
60,3day break,"I was worried about this hotel due to some of the negative feedback on Trip Advisor, but i can't fault it.  Our 3day stay was lovely.  Hotel was in a great location, very central.  It was very easy to get to from the Airport via the Airport bus, which left you off at the top of La Ramblas - 10euro for a return ticket.  The Metro was on La Ramblas, making getting too and from the sights and and train station very easy.  For 10journeys you pay 10euro, which was a bargin, and we used just the one card for the both of us.  Hotel was very comfortable, are room was lovely, room 306, not on the La Ramblas side, making it quiet.  Would definately visit again and stay in this hotel.",5,2016,11,17
60,Excellent hotel,"Location excellent, rooms comfortable and clean, all facilities. Breakfast good with plenty of variety and choice. Staff extremely helpful. Overall a very good stay, some rooms overlook the Ramblas but charge a premium. Our room was light and airy and suited us all well.",4,2016,11,15
60,Robert ,"My wife booked this for my 60th birthday, we stayed 5th - 8th Nov & had a brilliant time they even left Birthday greetings & a goody bag on my bed for me The hotel is situated handy as only 15 mins from plaza cattilunya & maybe the same to the harbour 
Good room towels changed each day & room tidied beds etc 
Our room overlooked the Main Street & noise wasn't as bad as some people have mentioned also the reception staff were very helpful .I would recommend to stay again 
",4,2016,11,14
60,Excellent complimentary breakfast!,"This hotel is great for a stay in Barcelona and right in the middle of everything, on Las Ramblas. Great location, not too far from cruise ship port. Nice sized room and even though our room faced the busy street, once we closed the balcony, it was nice and quiet. Excellent complimentary breakfast including sausages, eggs, etc.",4,2016,11,10
60,Clean and comfortable but don't fall for the free minibar........,"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in November 2016. The rooms were spacious, clean and suitably equipped. We decided to go for a deluxe room as there was a promise of a free minibar, which as we all would agree, would normally contain beers and wines and if your lucky - spirits too. However, the free minibar on this occasion only contained soft drinks, a packet of crisps and a kitkat!!. We felt this was a bit misleading, especially as we asked if there was beer in the fridge when we first arrived and was told by the man on reception ""I'm not sure""............other than that we had a pleasant stay and would stay there again (although not in a deluxe room ;-).",4,2016,11,09
60,Fantastic location!,"This is a nice hotel in a great location. Our room was overlooking las rambla and heard no noise from the street. We were minutes walk from everywhere. Rooms were spotless and cleaned everyday. Would go back. Very good value. Even getting to / from airport is great as Liceu station just outside (we took renfe train & metro, only takes 40 mins and €9.95 for a t10 ticket, excellent value!) ",4,2016,11,07
60,Great location shame about the staff,"I am going to be brutally honest about this hotel.
Good: great central location on La Ramblas
Free wifi
Bad: the staff are unhelpful & downright rude. I asked for an iron to be told no I couldn't have one but I could pay for the hotel to press my clothes, I have never stayed in a hotel that doesn't lend out irons.
I asked reception for ice to be told it would be sent to my room, 30 minutes later I called reception and asked again for ice to be told it would be another ten minutes, of course it never arrived, same with the extra pillow I requested 3 times, that never arrived either.
We were a large group & all the others had horror stories of how rude the staff had been to them, I only saw the cleaners smile, everybody else was rude and miserable.
At breakfast each morning the waitress was abrupt with us and never once said good morning. A hotel guest had her bag stolen in the restaurant at breakfast and was told by a member of staff that it was her own fault!
My sister called reception for ice to be told if she wanted it she would have to get it herself!
There's no air conditioning in the rooms and breakfasts the same boring food every day, they don't even make an effort to vary things.
On our last day the receptionist demanded we all pay a tourist tax or we wouldn't be allowed to leave the hotel, I am not kidding, I got the impression she was going to wrestle us to the floor if we attempted to leave! I asked for a receipt only to have it literally thrown at me, this has got to have the rudest hotel staff I have ever encountered and my suggestion is the manager either sacks them all or sends them to charm school because they are unbelievably rude and have a terrible attitude.

TIPS: There's no kettle in your room so bring one if you want tea or coffee.

Ask for a room at the rear of the hotel, the views rubbish but everyone who had a room overlooking Las Ramblas said they never slept as it was so noisy.

Would I stay here again? No way!",2,2016,11,07
60,Great location,Reception not very friendly but that could be a cultural thing. Being from Australia we tend to be over friendly. Room exceptionally big we had three beds in room even though there was only two of us.  The balcony was a bonus even though we were not overlooking the main area of La Rambla. Great location. If you need tours travel shop across road. We booked monseratt which is a must to see. Also sagrada familia .,4,2016,10,31
60,Minutes from so much!,"Our room, 402, had a small ""stand only"" balcony that overlooked the La Rambla directly below. It was a larger room than I expected for Europe; large closets with shelves, good size bathroom, a desk with chair and a good safe. Bedding was comfortable and room had a clean, fresh look...white and black with red accent pillows. They do not provide wash cloths (something I like to mention, since I do use them daily!) The hotel breakfast buffet looked very nice, but we never ate there. Staff was pleasant and greeted us. Lobby was comfortable modern and for sitting and reading. We loved overlooking the action on the street below and sitting at these cafes and restaurants, the noise never bothered us. Restaurants all close at the same time, so the street does get quiet. A lot of options to eat within minutes of the front door!  A five minute walk to the subway, 10 minute walk to Christopher Columbus monument and the water and a 15 minute walk to Catalunya Square. A tourism office is directly across the street from the hotel where we booked our hop-on and hop-off bus! AND they gave us a senior citizen discount! We cannot wait to return to Barcelona and this will be our ""home"" again!",5,2016,10,31
60,Loved it and booked again.,"Me and my partner loved this hotel, perfect location for everything on La Ramblas.
Staff very friendly and helpful, we had a beautiful view over looking La Ramblas. 
Recommend to friends and family and they have stopped since we did and loved it just as much as we did.",4,2016,10,31
60,"Great Location, Great Vaule , Food and Staff wonderful","Our second visit to Barcelona and we wish we had booked this hotel then as this is by far a great  hotel very very clean helpful staff loads of choice at breakfast, super price and vaule for money we will be booking again next year, even the wifi worked...",5,2016,10,30
60,3 night stay - pleasure,"We stayed as a couple and overlooked La Rambla. Was great for people watching on tiny standing room only balcony typical of buildings in area. Can't beat location but you need to be ok W the noise associated with the busy strip. For us it was great. Room was clean and pleasant. Didn't try the breakfast at the restaurant on first floor for about 11 euro. Maybe rooms in rear are quieter but then you can't see the strip. Price was quite good for location, busy hotel seems to be often sold out.",4,2016,10,29
60,Very good ,"Stayed here for 3 nights in October, and although the hotel is a little tired looking we had no complaints.
The room we fine, well lit and warm. Great shower, although it's impossible not to soak the floor.
The room was cleaned daily, and along with a free safe & fridge it suited us fine.
The reception staff were great, in fact one night shift chap helped us book tickets for parc guell, and gave us good information on local transport, which was greatly appreciated.
I would definitely recommend this hotel for a great location for a Barcelona mini break.",5,2016,10,27
60,Fun atrium and central location.,"This is a good hotel to start a trip to Barcelona. It is on the Ramblas, and therefore centrally located in the heart of the city. Parking has to be underground, but after that, you will be ready for anything. The hotel is very nice. Our room was in the inner court and therefore, very quiet. My only complaint was the shower leaked onto the floor of the bathroom, but that seemed to happen in almost every hotel (even top ones), that we went to. The breakfast buffet is fun, in the atrium, and good. But you must pay for it. Firm bed and pillows, which I don't mind. You can walk out the door and across the Ramblas for a great courtyard/boulevard to eat at. There was impromptu entertainment, as well. Also, a Gaudi house is close (like less than a block).",4,2016,10,26
60,Hmmmmm! ,"So. Writing this at 10pm local time on last night of 4 night stay.
Me, wife and 10 year old son.
Barcelona gets 10/10.
The hotel? Just 6!
Purposely asked for, & got, top floor room not overlooking Las Ramblas to reduce noise.  
So why only 6?
Location is great, room spacious and comfy but......
Walls are thinner than paper thin on 4th floor. I hear everything from next door, particularly bathroom activity! All of it! Even ""paperwork""
Breakfast is great, hot and cold food, good coffee!
No bar is a drag but plenty on Las Ramblas make up for it.
",4,2016,10,26
60,Good hotel in an excellent location in Barcelona,"We stayed in this hotel many years ago and remembered how good the location was- it certainly is also now. The rooms are very nice and breakfast was also nice. If you come by car- check about parking (not on site...), which requires a short walk.",4,2016,10,26
60,Great location & old traditional hotel,"My second visit but the first being over 10 years ago. This time it was with my son who is a wheelchair user. Ok. The hotel could not have been more accommodating or helpful. They even allowed us to check in really early which made a huge difference as we started travelling at 3am! Breakfast was between 7-11 which was very good although some of the breakfast staff were rather miserable! Choice of food was fine. Our room was probably in need of a lick of paint but it was spotlessly clean. But it is a 3 star so do not expect more. The location is great for everything but avoid eating on La Ramblas as it is a tourist trap - Coca Cola on La Ramblas = €6 and just slightly off the beaten track = €2.50. Hotel Oriente bar IS on La Ramblas so be careful! A very nice glass of Sangria = €9!!!! 
However, I would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel Oriente for able bodied or disabled travellers. Oh yes, they also have adapted rooms but you need to ask when booking. ",4,2016,10,26
60,You get what you pay for,"I've stayed in better hotels but if you're on a budget, I supposed this hotel is ok.

It was a spacious room but it smelled of disinfectant so we wanted to open the window but it was somewhat stuck. I called the reception for assistance but the lady at the desk said, ""we will send someone when we can"". So much for service. We eventually talked face-to-face with the man at the front desk and he personally when up with us to the room to open the window. It was stuck so he had to force the window open.

It was a cool evening so we just left the window open. The succeeding nights started to get warmer. We tried to work the air-conditioner but it was still too warm. That's my window story.

Out toilet came with a shower enclosure, not a tub, as my other friends had. The shower enclosure just had a glass divider without a door such that when we turned on the shower, water would spill out and wet the floor. Arrrgggg!

The location is good. It's right on Las Ramblas, it's close to a metro stop and also close to the Boqueria.",3,2016,10,26
60,Great location,"This hotel is in an ideal location right in the centre of la ramblas, plenty of cafes and bars around. Room was spacious and cleaned everyday, great shower over the bath. We were room only so never sampled food served by hotel. Service by staff was excellent, thought it was a nice touch giving out bottles of water when we checked in after travelling there. We stayed for 4 days and would stay again if going back to Barcelona. My only slight moan was that I could here the people in the rooms next to us in the morning when they were getting ready to check out.",4,2016,10,23
60,No heat,"We stayed two knights  ($338.00). The manager would not turn the heat on the time we spent in our room we had to stay in bed with the covers on. They compensated by giving us extra blankets, this was absolutely the worst experience we have ever had in all our travels. I do not recommend this hotel.",1,2016,10,23
60,Great location,"Part of the Atiram chain, Hotel Oriente is right in the centre of action on Ramblas. Much of what you want to see is within easy walking distance, and most other places can be reached by hop on-hop off buses. Location hard to beat. The hotel is well maintained, comfortable and spotless. Staff obliging and professional. Breakfast in the hotel is good value, but there are alternatives nearby. Typically no tea/coffee making facility in the room. Our only gripe is the bathroom, a case of form defeating function: wonderfully modern, thus little storage, no tray for soap etc in the shower.
A tip: if you have a late flight out and leave your bags at the hotel, there is a great space on the 1st floor to change into travel clothes and repack your cases.",4,2016,10,21
60,Problems at check in!,"Just back from a four night stay at Oriente Atriam. Arrived at check in to be told that our booking had been cancelled due to a problem with our debit card! The guy on reception wasn't helpful and advised us that the hotel had no availability for our stay! It was 2100 hours and he directed us to a neighbouring hotel to seek accommodation there. We were tired and hungry and when we got our thoughts together we challenged him and insisted that it was not our mistake and it was the hotels responsiblity to correct their mistake. He was able to 'magically' get us a room for the night in the hotel but insisted that we would have to negotiate for our accommodation for the remainder of our stay the next morning. The following morning we spoke with another receptionist who liased with the manager, (the manager did not speak with us face to face). we were offered room 304 which was an upgrade and breakfast was included for an additional €100, we reluctantly agreed that we would pay the extra. The hotel is in a perfect location and we did enjoy our time in Barcelona, however we were disappointed in how the hotel managed the mistake that they had made, we would have appreciated an apology from the manager or at least be offered the opportunity to speak with her face to face, perhaps a little training in customer relations would benefit some of their staff!",3,2016,10,21
60,city break with friends,Stayed here last weekend Friday till Monday and could not fault the place!  the Staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were lovely and clean towels changed every day and beds made...my pJ's were even folded nicely! Breakfast was plentiful and loads of choice. Bottles of water on arrival.  Fridge in room so we could buy drinks and they were cold...no tea making facilities tho ...but not a massive problem. La Ramblas is amazing...very busy but we had a room at the back and therefore very quiet. All in all a fabulous break in a lovely hotel in an amazing city! thankyou!,5,2016,10,21
60,Great location and comfortable room.,Clean affordable room with a great location. The one down side is that we could hear the metro rumbling every few minutes. We were close to the metro station and many great restaurants. The staff was very helpful.,5,2016,10,20
60,3 nights in Barcelona - perfect location ,"We stayed here for 3 nights for my partners birthday and anniversary.

Taxi from the airport came to €29

Arrived at around 10:30pm and checked in with ease. First impressions very good with Helpful staff. 

The rooms are large and spacious with a powerful shower and we had a balcony looking over las Ramblas. The double bed was large and relatively comfy also. Complimentary bottles of water on arrival! 

The location of this hotel is perfect right on the main strip. I would Deffinatly return we both fell in love with Barcelona there is so much to do! 

We decided not to have breakfast at the hotel. La boqueria market is only a 5 minute walk away where you can try all fresh and tasty local food and fruit juices to cure your hangover.

The one negative would be that you could hear people talking in the next room but overall very happy!",4,2016,10,19
60,GREAT LOCATION,"The room was clean, small, bathroom was clean, everything was in God working order.  Was mostly sightseeing and shopping.  Staff was helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable.
Would book again at this hotel. LOCATION was perfect!",3,2016,10,19
60,Great central location in Barcelona,"Good clean hotel with large rooms. It serves a tasty breakfast with plenty of choices. The staff are friendly and helpful.
The location could not be better on the main tourist street and minutes from the harbour.
The rooms at the front of the hotel can be a little noisy.",4,2016,10,19
60,Wonderful experience in a first class location.,"Just returned from a two night break with my family at the Oriente Atiram. Faultless. Staff extremely friendly. Nothing too much trouble. Bottles of iced water handed to us as we checked in. Beds and towels changed after one night. The location was amazing with bars and restaurants within a few minutes' walk. A little more expensive than other parts of the city but worth every penny for the entertainment alone! We'll definitely return. Thank you,",5,2016,10,18
60,Location,"The room was perfect for what we wanted after a day of sight seeing room was an average size with a small balcony shower was good room was cleaned and new linen and towels every day for our 5 day stay staff were more than helpful with everthing . 
We did not have breakfast so cant coment hotel is in a great location for metro and tourist buses",5,2016,10,18
60,Fantastic hotel!! You will not be disappointed! :),Booked this place for a long weekend with my partner & could not fault the hotel at all. Staff were extremely helpful & friendly & the hotel & the room was brilliant. I searched through many hotels reading reviews on here & decided upon Oriente as it was slightly cheaper than some of the others & am so glad I did. Would book with this hotel again..1st class hotel & service :),5,2016,10,18
60,Rocking toilets and noise,"First the positives--great location on La Ramblas.  Staff is friendly.  Room was clean.  Nice selection at breakfast.  Now, the negatives--Despiit the website saying the Windows have been upgraded with soundproof glass, the all night, yes ALL night noise from the crowds strolling Las Ramblas was hard to ignore. The toilet in my room was not connected to the floor and tilted alarmingly every time you sat.  TV remote was non-functional.  Reported these several times but nothing was done.  But, the biggest annoyance was that the room bore no resemblance to the photos on ther website.  I hate when hotels do that.  It  is bait and switch in the highest.   My Ramblas room was not awful, but more like a dorm room size and surnishings.  No clock in the room.  Almost no amenities.  If you are going to be out enjoying the wonders of beautiful Barcelona all day and will only use he room to sleep it isn't a bad deal.  But, do ask for seat belts for that toilet....",3,2016,10,13
60,Perfect location,"This location was absolutely perfect for our first stay in Barcelona - right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of La Ramblas, we were easily able to walk almost everywhere we chose to go.

The room was clean and spacious and staff were helpful.

We did not eat at the hotel however, as we preferred to go out for meals.",4,2016,10,12
60,Below average ,"Hotel is located on las ramblas 
Perfect location ! 
Rooms are clean and average size 
But they dont provide any service 
Even if you are with kids you need to carry your luggage to your rooms 
No parking 
They dont even provide cattle in rooms 
So for those who are traveling   with kids find it very difficult 
They even cant give you ice or warm water!
Staff was not very helpful exept one girl named fatao(fatima) 
Breakfast was ordinary ! 

A big no to this hotel for those who are traveling with infants !",2,2016,10,02
60,Perfect Location for exploring Barcelona on foot,"My husband and I had a short break to Barcelona and we chose to stay at the Oriente Atiram as it was perfectly located on Las Rambla and we had stayed there previously when it had been known as Husa Oriente. 

We stayed for 4 nights and we had a room looking on to a side street away from the hustle and bustle of La Rambla to the front of the hotel. Because of the location of the hotel we chose to get a taxi to the hotel and it was difficult to park up when we arrived due to the busy nature of the street outside so when we arrived he did have to stop around the corner and drop us off however when we left he was able to pick us up right outside.

The staff on the reception were extremely helpful and the room we stayed in was spacious and kept clean during our stay. 

We didn't choose to eat at the hotel as we wanted to sample the traditional cuisine during our stay so chose to eat in local eateries in and around the city.

A great priced hotel, in the middle of the action and perfect location to base your city stay",4,2016,09,28
60,lovely and convenient,perfect place if u want to catch all the action in La Rambla. best location. friendly staff. a little small for main check in area but room were comfortable. all bars and restaurant is just outside of lobby and within walking distance you will find so many souvenier shops and restaurant.,4,2016,09,26
60,EXCELLENT XXX,"Desk staff extremely helpfull well done all

WELL DONE TO YOU ALL 
JUST FIX THE COFFEE MACHINE SEE YOU AGAIN 
THANKS ",5,2016,09,26
60,Great Location,"We stayed here for 3 nights with friends, the hotel is clean, staff  are very friendly and it is situated right on La Rambla .It is about halfway up and so is in a fantastic location, we would definitely use this hotel again.",4,2016,09,26
60,Everything they said it would be,"The Ramblas Room is accurately described as functional and the only plus over the other rooms is the balcony onto the Ramblas. Despite that, there was a sense of disappointment in what we got.
The bed was very basic and not altogether comfortable. The sound insulation was good. The bathroom was serviceable but compact and not luxurious. The TV had little in the way of English speaking channels. The breakfast was OK.
The big plus of this hotel is its location and proximity to restaurants and metro station.
So, yes, it was not a bad place to stay but didn't hit the five stars.",4,2016,09,26
60,"GREAT LOCATION, CLEAN AND HELPFULL","2 ladies on there own, brill location, booked room that looked onto Las Ramblas, very clean, breakfast fine, continental and scrambled eggs, small sausages, bacon and beans. would 100% stay here again, help full staff.",5,2016,09,21
60,"Great location, Great service, Lovely rooms","Stayed at this hotel with my partner and would stay here again without a doubt if we returned to Barcelona.  We arrived late in the evening and were still greeted with a smile and a free bottle of water which was very welcome.  The room was exactly as the description and we were very happy with it.  
The location of the hotel is also a great selling point as it doesnt get any better, you are right in the middle of the main action which is fantastic.
Overall we think this is a hotel that we would be happy to use again and think others would like it too. Thanks.",4,2016,09,20
60,not good,i visited Barcelona in august and slept in oriente atiram hotel. first of all the people at the reception are not helpful at all and are very rude especially the receptionist  girl called Natalia she checked me  in when i first arrived and she gave me a very bad first impression i would recommend to stay in another place there are plenty of other hotels in the same street,2,2016,09,20
60,Lovely hotel,"We were very very pleasantly surprised when we checked in to this hotel. We had a room facing las Ramblas with a balcony overlooking the street. The soundproofing is excellent; we heard no street noise at all. The room it's self is was very nice, bed was very comfortable, and the staff was excellent. The location cannot be beat!",5,2016,09,18
60,Fantastic,"As a motability scooter user this hotel is very good it has a lift and ramps and is in a great location, close to lovely restaurants and within easy reach of the harbour and within walking distance of many of the main attractions.  ",4,2016,09,13
60,Great Staff Great Location,You can't beat the location.  The staff did a great job.  They helped us book tours and print tickets.  Then helped us arrange transportation since we had 6 in our group and couldn't fit in 1 cab.  They went way beyond what we would have expected.,5,2016,09,12
60,Brill hotel,Came here for my 30th wedding anniversary. Great hotel room clear tidy staff very helpful breakfast buffet was lovely too. Right on the las ramblas which was fab 10 mins walk to harbour will come back to this hotel again.,5,2016,09,11
60,Brilliant location. Good clean stay!,"Its in Les Ramblas. Litetally the most happening part of Barcelona. Just dont eat at restaurants right in the middle of Les Ramblas as you will just be paying a bomb. Everything is very close by. Shopping, eating, drinking, public transport and pretty much the heart of the city. 
Talking of the hotel, its nothing fancy and the rooms arent big or anything.But its neat and clean and if you are the kinds who is more outdoor than indoor then this hotel is the perfect bet for the price you pay. There is wifi available in your own rooms too.",4,2016,09,11
60,Stay away -- Not even the basic amenities for a very high price,"On short notice, I was happy to find this 3 star hotel available while all others were already booked.  Now I understand why.  The photos don't reflect the conditions, and the room was very basic, without even a small refrigerator.  I typically never purchase items from the mini-bar, but I do like to be able to bring leftover food from the resturaunt or items from the market after a long day.  To gain this ability at this hotel, you had to purchase the luxury room at quite an extreme price.  The staff did offer to put an item in their staff refrigerator, but this is not a solution for a hotel which claims to be a quality hotel.  The only advantage to this hotel is the location.  I have stayed in hotels on the same street and in the same area for much less cost and much better conditions and much better staff.   Next time I come to Barcelona, be sure that I will make my reservations earlier and stay away from this hotel.",1,2016,09,10
60,Great hotel,Great hotel. Very clean and fantastic location. Located right on Las Ramblas you couldn't ask for anything better. I have stayed here twice now - first time we had a more modern room at the front and second time we had one of the slightly older rooms at the back. Both great. The hotel is not particularly fancy but we didn't spend much time in the hotel as there is so much to see in the city. Would recommend this hotel,4,2016,09,10
60,Great location,"This hotel is perfectly positioned on Las Ramblas. The staff were friendly and helpful- all speaking good English. Breakfast buffet was good value for the money and there was a good variety of food which was fresh. 

The room was spacious and in reasonable repair - however the hairdryer overheated and turned off after 10 seconds of use (not great with 3 girls in the room!), also the cleaner broke the only accessible plug socket on day 2. 

All in all, great value for money and perfect location - just take your own hairdryer! ",4,2016,09,09
60,"Beautiful city, horrible hotel","The hotel is outdated and dirty. The furniture in our room was falling apart and the beds gave me and my family back pain. Please don't stay here, the tripadvisor pictures do not reflect the true state of this hotel.",2,2016,09,08
60,"Great location - NO FRILLS, get what you pay for","My friend and I stayed at this hotel during our 3-day trip to Barcelona.  The location is PERFECT for sight-seeing in the Old City.  The common areas of the hotel look very nice - but the rooms do not match the pictures online.  Our room was very clean, which was the saving grace. But it smelled of smoke so badly it bothered my allergies (we were told we had a non-smoking room) and the wallpaper and floors were peeling up in small places.  One of the bed reading lamps and the hairdryer were broken upon arrival, and the front desk was not overly concerned when they were reported.  It was the most uncomfortable bed I've ever slept in.  But it was CHEAP compared to others in the area!  BOTTOM LINE - we got what we paid for, and since all we did was sleep there, it was manageable.  But do not book here if you are picky about the appearance of your room or plan to spend much time there.",3,2016,09,07
60,Fellow Americans - Don't bother,"This was my first hotel stay in Europe and I guess my expectations were very high and thus I was sadly dissatisfied with my stay here for three nights.  I thought it was me until I visited the hotel where my friend was staying and it was confirmed that It wasn't.
The room was extremely small for a family of four.  Two twin beds put together and then a sofa pull out, there was hardly any walking space and no other mirror in the room other than the vanity mirror in the bathroom.  The shower head fell a couple of times which nearly missed my head, i guess it moves with the water pressure?  I was so afraid that someone in my family would get hurt that I would turn the shower on and off for my 
children.  It was really an accident waiting to happen.  
I have to mention that the mattress was less than six inches thick and I felt all the springs. I woke up with back pain every morning.
The hotel was so poor i dreaded staying there each night. I literally woke up in a bad mood every morning.  
Oh I almost forgot, I got the breakfast included in my stay.  Please don't, the eggs were watery and not much of a selection. Lesson learned a hotel stay can make or break your vacation.  Don't let this one break yours. Thank God it was a short stop for us before going on a cruise.
Hope this helps.",1,2016,09,06
60,Good value and location,"We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights and enjoyed it. For us, the location was perfect as we could walk to most attractions we wanted to see and to many good restaurants. And if you don't want to walk, the metro is a block away.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  Noise from the street in a 4th floor room could bother some but we didn't find it bad. My only complaints were that we had to spend our wedding anniversary trip in two beds, pushed together, the beds are very hard and the air conditioning is so so.  Overall a nice visit in a nice, clean, friendly hotel.",3,2016,09,06
60,Great Location!,"The Oriente is a lovely hotel, right smack bang in the middle of Las Ramblas. It's like a haven from all the chaos of the road it is on. We found the hotel to be super clean and quiet, however the bathroom was very weird. There was no door on the shower so it was unavoidable that the whole bathroom floor got drenched while having a shower. There was also nowhere to put the soap or other bits in the shower. The cleaner did a great job, though, of making the bathroom wonderful each day.
We must have had a cheap room, as our view was of a brick wall four feet away. Also, there is no bar fridge in the room. The air conditioning was efficient and quiet. All up, it was a lovely place to sleep.",4,2016,09,01
60,"Great Location, large room.","Right on La Ramblas so expect noise and commotion. The room we had was huge, there was even a sofa bed in the room. It also had two small balconies which were right on La Ramblas,  the noise did not carry through to the room when the balcony doors were closed.  We had no fridge, only two power-points in the room, one being in the bathroom and a small TV with no English speaking stations.  Only had the breakfast the day we left and for 12E you could  eat away from the hotel for cheaper. (just down the street the KFC is on a great coffee shop) The staff were helpful and the rooms were kept very clean. Our room had not been renovated and the flooring could be replaced.but it was good for a 3 star hotel.",4,2016,08,28
60,Weekend break,"Nice hotel in the heart of La Ramblas, rooms are nice and clean.Staff are helpfull and nice, Balcony looking on to the street is great although would have been better if it was a bit bigger. 
Beds changed everyday, free water on arrival, staff gave us free tickits to opium nightclub great for all ages very trendy. No need to eat here as there plenty available round about. Room can be noisy but if thats what you want its good for people watching...through the day...after  midnight it is a different area. All in all a great place to stay ",4,2016,08,28
60,Great location and huge room with some basics missing,"If you want a great location, this hotel ticks all the boxes. It is right on La Rambla so expect noise and commotion. The twin room we had was huge, there was even a sofa bed in the room. It also had a small balcony which was away from the main road. Thankfully, the noise of the Main Street did not carry through to the room when the balcony doors were closed but you could clearly hear conversations in other rooms and the corridors. However, we had no fridge, no iron or ironing board, no coffee making facilities and only two power-points in the room, one being in the bathroom. This is not ideal for the modern traveller when trying to recharge multiple phones, tablets etc. Also, the TV was the size of a computer screen (not suitable for the room size) and had no English channels, which was annoying. I would expect that I wouldn't need to upgrade my room just to get these basics. The breakfast was OK for the EU12 but I would probably eat away from the hotel for cheaper. The staff were helpful and the rooms were kept very clean. Our room had not been renovated but it was good for a 3 star hotel. But they really need to have a basic amenity like a fridge etc in all rooms.",3,2016,08,26
60,Perfect Location!,"If you are visiting Barcelona for the first time, Oriente Atiram is ideal.  It's located right on Las Ramblas with easy access to transportation and walking distance to El Born, La Boqueria, Barceloneta Beach, Placa Catalunya, Plaza Reial, and more!!  It's most ideal for a short-term stay; it's a pretty touristy location.  Don't expect luxury, but you're getting a pretty good deal for the price - location alone makes it worthwhile.  The breakfast add-on is probably best for families with little ones (convenience), otherwise - you're probably better off going elsewhere for breakfast (same buffet menu daily... not much variety).  We stayed in a Ramblas Deluxe Room on the 4th floor, and the glass balcony doors were pretty soundproof.",3,2016,08,25
60,", i recommend it ! very good hotel","this is a 3 stars hotel located in heart of ramblas avenue . 
1. rooms - very good for 3 starts hotel, maintenace should improve in some of the rooms.
2. staff - excellent ! very welcoming , always with smile . happy to assist in any quetion i had asked. 
3. cleaning - very good 
4. breakfast - very good 
5. location - excelent, close to the metro so you can go any where from there , close to few of the main attractions in barcelona center. 

summary: 
i recomand this hotel for any one visiting barceona and looking for 3/4 stars hotel. 
my stay with familiy was excelent .",5,2016,08,25
60,Don't bother,"First time I'd booked a hotel through Tripadvisor and the price was good so thought I'd give it a go. Lesson learnt and will never use this hotel or Tripadvisor ever again. Booked the rooms we wanted and my payment went through, only to receive an email next day saying card had not been accepted and told to phone hotel to sort it out. Phoned hotel in Barcelona at a cost of £5 and agreed to cancel the reservation and I'd book again with a different card. Next day receive same email again saying the new card had been refused. So I contact HSBC to see what the problem was and they said that both my credit and debit cards are fine and the issue must be with hotel. So I contacted Tripadvisor to try sort this out so they communicated with the hotel on my behalf but we couldn't get anywhere. In the end i told them that there was no way to resolve this so they could cancel the reservations, they're loss. Since this I've booked a nicer hotel via booking.com for a similar price and no hassle with payments or booking. I've made a few bookings via booking.com in the past and always had a great reliable service so I'll stick to them in the future.",1,2016,08,23
60,Great Location; friendly staff,"Visited with my teenage son for a
Short break.  We booked room only but took advantage of the buffet breakfast a couple of days - this was an extra €12 each and ok - a good way to fill up to face a busy day exploring the city.  The hotel is airy and clean and built to keep the temperature down when it's hot outside - no air con in the room so it did get hot overnight - made the mistake of
Leaving the window open and got a bunch of mosquito bites for my trouble - so remember your insect repellents.   There was a little fridge in the room which was great for chilling the water and making sure there was a cold beer to come back to.  The room also has a safe so good for leaving valuables while out exploring.  The staff were helpful and friendly and the main positive was the great location - 10 mins walk from the Placa Catalunya and 5
Minutes from the Port.   If you need cheap fast food there are well know Burger & Chicken restaurants over the road .  There is a Metro station just a few
Minutes walk away and the system is cheap and easy to get around the city.  So not a bad base for exploring Barcelona.",4,2016,08,22

60,"Good, comfortable hotel","Good hotel, fantastic location 😊 on the Ramblas. Stayed  in a good size family room with 3 beds. Rooms clean and comfortable with a/c and great shower! Staff  friendly and helpful. No tea and coffee making facilities in room which was only disappointment. Would definitely stay again. ",4,2016,08,22
60,Okay for a hostel,"like the other reviewers have mentioned, this place is a hostel that bears little resemblance to the photos on the website (i'm convinced that's actually an entirely different hotel). the decor is ancient and the amenities are pretty much nonexistent. it is also severely understaffed - asked to borrow an adaptor from the front desk (which requires a €10 deposit) and was told i had to come pick it up myself. the personnel speak limited english and aren't very helpful at all - my boyfriend had a question about sagrada familia that the front desk couldn't answer, and they refused to make a phone call to find out for him (the rate to use the phone in the room is €.20/minute for local calls). what's more, we had requested a double bed but got two twin beds instead - we had to physically go to the front desk to try to resolve the issue (they could not/did not want to talk about it over the phone). in the end (which was a day later) they ""fixed"" the issue by joining the twin beds together with some sort of binding.

the good thing about staying here is that its sheer discomfort really forces you to go out and explore the city, which is beautiful!",2,2016,08,20
60,Great Hotel - Great Service,"Great hotel and great service. When we arrived they upgraded our room without us asking which was great. The staff were very helpful. Only thing we didn't get was a fridge int he room, no big deal to be honest.",4,2016,08,19
60,Good hotel for family.,"Hotel perfect in the center. Clean room with space. Changed room so the girls would have own beds. Part of the rooms are renovated, but no problem with first room anyway. Would have been nice with a minibar. ",5,2016,08,19
60,Great location and lovely building with helpful staff,"This hotel is located brilliantly to bus tours, beach and all shops and restaurants. The staff where really helpful as I asked for extra pillows for our two rooms and they where there when we returned from our evening meal very impressed. Only thing I could complain about is that our shower in room 443 was not built very well every time we took a shower the floor was soaking as there was no door on it and water splashed out everywhere. Didn't have a view from a window and other room 222 didn't have any window, but the hotel was full so couldn't be fussy.  But all in all a clean and lovely hotel for a very affordable price. Would definitely stay again.",4,2016,08,18
60,Fantastic location!,"The staff is very friendly and helpful. The room was simple but clean. We had a room away from la Rambla and it was quiet. Bed was not the softest but we slept OK. 
The breakfast staff, Claudia, Alex, and Doris were awesom! Overall we were very happy with the hotel.",3,2016,08,18
60,Location was perfect,"Pros: 
Location was 10/10 - near to loads of good restaurants
Nice room- nice bathroom and beds were relatively cosy. Had a safe and a window to look out.
Held our bags on the last day after we checked out
Really nice staff
Lovely building

Cons:
Can slightly hear people in rooms next to you if they are loud
Wasn't a complete door to the shower, so the bathroom floor got a bit wet

Overall it was a good stay",4,2016,08,16
60,Beautiful building with great location,"Lovely Hotel with a nice atmosphere, great location near the Rambla, the staff were very friendly and helpful, our room was very clean and we have a great vue to the Rambla, nice breakfast, quiet inside the Hotel",5,2016,08,16
60,Comfortable hotel right in the heart of things,Very happy with this hotel.  It was right on the busy tourist street but was quiet and comfortable.  Very near the metro stop and beach.  Room was large by European standards as we had three people and they accommodated our needs.,5,2016,08,15
60,4 day trip,the crockery at breakfast was terrible the cups were old and dirty the chair in my room had no padding left in it .the staff were not very good waiting ages to get ur key although they saw you waiting just carried on with whatever and we just had to wait. never spoke to us at all.we went to another hotel just up the road from this one called the 1898 hotel for dinner and the staff were great id recommend that one if i go back defenetly going to that hotel wouldn't go back to the orient sorry,3,2016,08,14
60,Beautiful building in an excellent spot,"On arrival, it's a beautiful building, slap bang on Las Ramblas.

The staff were very pleasant and allowed us to leave our luggage several hours before check in. The key to our first room didn't work and staff came immediately to assist us, however we still couldn't get in. We were swiftly rehomed and lucky for us, our new room was overlooking Las Ramblas with double doors onto a Juliet balcony. We are nosey people watchers so were in our element.

We opted for room only and breakfast was easy to find anywhere along Las Ramblas.

Unfortunately we did not have tea/coffee facilities in the room, no bar area in the hotel and only a vending machine to purchase a coffee.

The room was clean, nice and spacious and there was a large bathroom.

Some people have suggested this hotel is noisey in the early hours as revellers pass by, however, whilst I acknowledge that there was some noise, it certainly wasn't loud or annoying enough to cause us a problem ......and we stayed during the weekend.

Superb location, however we have stayed elsewhere since due to the lack of a morning brew at the Oriente but will likely return to this hotel on out next trip.",3,2016,08,14
60,Very convenient location,"The location of the hotel, on La Rambla, is very convenient for the main tourist sites in the city.  However, it did mean that it was a bit noisy at night.  Rooms were very clean, and the housekeeping staff were very friendly.  We didn't use the in-house restaurant (as usual with city-centre hotels, it was very easy to get good food cheaper nearby).  We left behind some documents in the room safe - when we phoned during the evening, there was some confusion, but when we returned the next day, all the stuff was ready for us at the desk.",4,2016,08,14
60,very good hotel,The position of the hotel is perfect to see the centre of Barcellona and also to go to the seaside. Our family room was big and very well organized. Everything was very clean and the staff was kind and smily. I am very satisfy for having choosen this hotel!,5,2016,08,12
60,Good location on La Rambla,"Great location on La Rambla! 
The rooms are small and some are more updated than others. We had one updated room and one older room, both were fine. Air conditioning works perfectly and the breakfast buffet is ok. We explored all day and were hardly ever in our rooms so, for the price, this hotel was perfectly fine with us!",3,2016,08,11
60,Really enjoyable,"Super location right on Las Ramblas with its own street bar and we all enjoyed all aspects of Barcelona. Rooms were great ....very clean and spacious and would thoroughly recommend staying at this Hotel. 
",4,2016,08,10
60,Good hotel,"Good hotel, centrale place, adequate cleaning service , very friendly staff. Excellent link with principal city's points. The hotel service implies also an optional  rich breakfast,  despite the fact it is expensive. ",4,2016,08,10
60,"Fantastic location, but noisy!","We loved the Oriente Atriam! Absolutely beautiful building, clean & decent sized room. All staff were very friendly & helpful. The only downside for us was the lack of sleep due to the street noise ALL night. Not sure if it was worse because we stayed over a weekend, but each night/morning we woke to people screaming, arguing or fighting on the street! Great view, but wouldn't recommend a street facing room! ",4,2016,08,09
60,LOVELY HOTEL,"Thoroughly recommend , staff were very friendly,  lovely and clean,  comfortable room, perfect location right in the heart of Barcelona. If you want a lovely clean hotel in the heart of everything then you cannot go wrong here.",5,2016,08,09
60,Very good hotel,"Excellent position, very good good servers. The hotel should allow to take Frut out of the dinner room because we eat only a kosher food and because of that we eat little and when we wanted to took some Frut thel told as that it forbidden.",4,2016,08,09
60,Best place,This is the best place of the la ramblas.. And the room has a great view ı advise everbody to stay.. If ı will come again ı would go same hotel beause it is the best one ı think..they are so kindly because of simple gifts..,5,2016,08,09
60,OK hotel in center of Barcelona,"An average hotel with good location in center of Barcelona. Not very professional staff in reception.
Breakfast slightly below average. Room standard was OK. Location is perfekt if you like citylife...",3,2016,08,09
60,Convenient access to the main places of Barcelona,Take hotel not the LA RAMBLA street on the summer. Very noisy place .Convenient access to the main places of Barcelona.very close to the market . Close to the sea shore .close to the metro.High Air Pollution in the la rambla street on the summer !!!,3,2016,08,08
60,Bad staff,The price is too much for this hotel they cheat on me if you have a chance try another hotel in the la rambla they give us a very bad room when we ask them to change it to any other room they said all the three beds like this and when we check in again we get a good room ! The staff bad is not enough for them,1,2016,08,08
60,Awesome,"Great view of Ramblas from the small balcony, clean bathroom with  tub. Good AC and soundproof from the street, so you don't need to have the door open even when it's very hot outside. Free Wifi, the only minus is that the pillows were a bit uncomfortable. Really good for the price! ",4,2016,08,08
60,Great location!!,"The hotel was clean and the room was spacious. The location was the best part of this hotel. We could walk to shopping, restaurants, and the Gothic district. We had the family room and it fit 2 adts, a teen, and a 4 year old. ",4,2016,08,08
60,Very basic.,Small rooms very basic. Disappointed no hospitality tray. Elderly couple we spent evenings in this basic hotel. Would not be back. No option to pay for hospitality tray instead you have to upgrade rooms. On website states rooms have fridges when this was not the case either. ,3,2016,08,08
60,Best place to stay in ramlas,"Super place to stay in Barcelona. Nice breakfast. And near to beach. Staffs are very friendly. Try once and feel ur experience and share ur experience. U get taxi every minute in front of this hotel. I feel like home. 
",5,2016,08,08
60,Excellent location.,"Excellent location right on La Rambla.  Small personable hotel.  Close to amenities ( shops, restaurants, tourist attractions, Gothic Quarter).  Rooms small but clean. Beds not overly comfortable.  Kind and very friendly staff. ",3,2016,08,07
60,Good Choice!,"It is a three star hotel, 
Location is Great!   If you want to be where all the action is, this is the place for you.   It sits write in the heart of Ramblas, close to metro, bus etc...  We were surprised to have a room with a balcony facing Las Ramblas and it was QUITE the noise did not come through  we had a first floor room (which is second floor in America).
Walking distance to everything! Service at front desk average.    Cleanliness of room: little above average.   
Would come back to this hotel!
",3,2016,08,05
60,poor,poor as unclean. rooms clean but not the food area dont to bed and breakfast unless you like drinking out of dirty cups. no interaction with staff. only good thing was room attendant was nice and cleaned the room to a high standard,1,2016,08,01
60,Surprise,"What a pleasant surprise, had guests come to visit and put them up at the Orient Hotel, the rooms were clean, the price reasonable, the location right where they wanted to be.

They were extremely happy, that's my next stop........",5,2016,08,01
60,Wow,"We had a Deluxe Ramblas Room and although not as big as expected it was perfect for a short city break for me and my partner. Hotel is in an excellent location, almost central on La Rambla. Staff were very friendly and we couldn't fault anything with the hotel. Barcelona is an amazing city and we can't wait to visit again. This hotel will definitely be our No 1 choice when we do!",5,2016,07,28
60,Would have been 5 stars,"Me, my husband and our 10month daughter stayed at this hotel after I managed to get a great deal. Through research, it as the hotel that really stood out to me. 
We had booked a deluxe room and were not disappointed! The location is brilliant, the rooms spacious and the staff friendly. Yes, people have complained about the noise of the metro, but that didn't bug us at all. 
The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because I had to explain to staff that I was staying in a deluxe room and therefore needed the extras that came with the room (I think at one point I asked for milk because there was none in the room and we had a kettle). Although the matter was dealt with, I had to speak to 3 different members of staff before they understood (the first two kept telling me I didn't have a kettle on my room). 
Overall we had a pleasant stay, my daughter absolutely loved the space in the room and the location was fantastic. In the evening we simple popped out little one in the pushchair and enjoyed the hustle and bustle of las ramblas. We were able to walk to the zoo and took a taxi to Nau Camp. Things like KFC, McDonalds, Burger King, Flahertys, Walk to Wok, Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks are very close. There are also many other restaurants nearby!",4,2016,07,26
60,Perfect for 3 days Barcelona city vacation,"We needed a clean and close-to-city hotel for a short visit. The room was clean and very spacy with marble floor wich made it luxury and at the same time cool for feet. We had a hot vacation but that was expected and fine. The breakfast was up to standard but not luxury, and was exactly what we needed for some sightseeing mornings. Better spend time and money on lazy lunch and late dinners.",5,2016,07,23
60,Why would you? Why would you not?,"Why would you go B&B? 
This hotel is in a fantastic location on Las Rambla. Step out of the hotel doors and you have so many restaurants and cafes literally on your doorstep why would you settle for the same breakfast every day.

Why would you not stay here?
The rooms are functional, clean. The staff are polite and willing to help. The hotel reception could look smarter. As previously mentioned the hotel is in a fantastic location, walk across Las Rambla and you can walk into the square where there is the most fantastic atmosphere and array of restaurants.

During the day turn right out of the hotel doors you have the beautiful harbour. Genuinely, the location could not be better.

So why would you not stay here..... If you are looking for a 'high brow' hotel where the staff are waiting on you hand and foot and are falling over you to earn a tip....if you are looking for a lovely roof top pool with lovely views......if you are looking for a hotel with a sumptuous reception that oozes class......if you are looking for a hotel room with beautiful views and fantastic facilities. 

HOWEVER..... If you are looking for a hotel that has a charming exterior with good rooms (and a massive bed!) that represents excellent value for money get it booked!!!!!

We would definitely stay here again.",4,2016,07,22
60,Our Barcelona trip..,"Hotel was first class, step out the front door onto La Rambla ! The room had three single beds and plenty of space, the breakfast area had been an outside central courtyard and they had put a glass roof onto it in the shape of a pyramid and it is really nice. Room was clean and staff very pleasant and helpful.. would go back !!",4,2016,07,22
60,Good location. But,"Stayed for three days in this so so hotel, read on.
Checkin was at 2:00pm only, we all lined up for two checkin staff very slow Frustrating when you are there early, could not even do the paper work before two.
Very poor checkin procedure.
Staff very friendly and helpful but not enough..
Our group reserved two moths earlier for the same price and the rooms were large to small be careful
No iron or tissues in room. No face clothes as in N. America
Buses,Metro and taxis close by.
Close to port but taxi drivers will over charge get firm price.
Our room had tea,coffee and kettle the other family members had none  but paid the same.
Front rooms are a little noisy
No control of AC be prepared, heat maybe the same. 
TV didn't work but was fixed. One English Channel but poor reception couldn't watch
TV the size of a postage stamp.
Rooms were clean but plain in N American standards 
Beds were large enough for a big man and comfortable.
Phoned didn't work but was fixed.
Breakfast was good but cost 12.00euros at time of printing
Ladies of the night were near if so inclined on Rambls
Location was very good,c centre of tourist area but costly to eat on the strip, walk off the strip to get better prices. Staff provided alternative areas to eat, ask
Dry cleaning available but very very expensive!.
Would we stay again yes but we would be very particular about the size of the room.
We did enjoy our stay, a beautiful city..",3,2016,07,20
60,Very good,"
We were at a five full days . Definitely hotel must indicate : great service , stunning rooms , convenient location in the center of everything , courteous and smiling ! Breakfast was also very nice .
",5,2016,07,19
60,Good hotel in a great position,"This hotel is in the perfect position to explore the old town and only a short trip to the beach as well. 
The breakfast was good and the rooms were a good size. It is a busy hotel with a lot of coming and going and if your room is on the front then you will have the noise from Las Ramblas most of the evening.
But if your out enjoying the atmosphere this will not matter. Well worth staying at the only thing missing is a pool.",4,2016,07,18
60,Very disappointed ,When we arrived room wasn't ready had to leave bags and go for a walk. Was asked for credit card or €50 deposit on room even though was booked through Thomas Cook.  Was also charged a city tax on leaving. Was no tea or coffee facilities in room. Room was small. Some staff came across as really ignorant. I would not stay in one of their hotels again. ,2,2016,07,16
60,Overrated location and dingy room,"If you are looking for a no-frills, cheap hotel with good party location - sure. 
If you want a relaxing, couples retreat to Barcelona - stay clear.

We had booked The Oriente for a week because of the central location and reasonable price, but ended up moving after 3 days. Our room was very small, dark and worn down, and did not look anything like the pictures online. The room was only just wide enough for the two single beds that were squished together, and the courtyard view added nothing positive to our overall impression. Even though the location was central, the Ramblas quickly got old with the constantly pestering club promoters and tourist traps.
We ended up moving to the Gothic Quarter, and had an amazing rest of our vacation!",2,2016,07,14
60,Great location.....,"My room was a little on the small side and very basic for the price. However, the staff were marvellous. Cheery, helpful. The location was perfect for walking most everywhere and close to the metro station and numerous great cafes and restaurants. ",3,2016,07,14
60,La Rambla Experience,"This hotel was in a great location and our room looked over La Rambla.  The breakfast offered a good selection of hot and cold and lovely fresh pastries.  We were more than happy with our choice of hotel and would definitely stay there again.
",5,2016,07,12
60,Comfort  stay,The location of the hotel is excellent right in the heart of la ramblas opp placa  reial   easy accessability   we didn't try any room service as everything was available just  outside the hotel    staff was very cooperative in storing luggage fr  14 days ,5,2016,07,12
60,I recommend,"Well located and very good hotel no problem at all, rooms are comfortable and clean. I'll come back to Barcelona as soon as I can. I did not test the breakfast but it sounds good according to my colleagues",5,2016,07,12
60,Great location,"The location is awesome.  We walked every where.  A few minutes away to two metro stations, 15min to cataluniya square (pick up/drop off for airport shuttle and other tour buses).  Walked to the beach, and gothic area and shopping.  The hotel is basic and simple, but well kept and you can't beat the lively location.  If you're looking for a quiet area, this probably isn't for you. ",4,2016,07,11
60,Excellent location,"Nice and cosy hotel with an excellent location in the middle of La Rambla. The rooms were quite small, but functional and cleaned every day. Friendly staff and quiet at night. Would be more than happy to stay here again! ",5,2016,07,11
60,Enjoyable. ,Would recommend for it's location.  Breakfast was plentiful.  Staff were very helpful. I was disappointed on arrival at the room as it was not overlooking La Ramblas but  very quickly realised that although we didn't have a great  view from our window the room was exceptionally  quiet at night.  I  would  use this hotel again. Going back to Barcelona soon and will  definitely consider this hotel again. ,4,2016,07,10
60,Average. Could be better,"Though the hotel had a superb location, the staff who were not hospitable enough, was truly a major let down. They did not even smile or greet customers and lacked basic english skills. When they had to interact with customers in english, they were not only rude but also dismissed customer's requests by bluntly saying ""I don't understand"". In addition to this, the torn curtains in the room was not only disappointing but really showed the hotel's level of standard. Such a shame given that the hotel had a very good location.",3,2016,07,06
60,good location vs poor services,"The hotel is located on the Rambla somehow pretty quiet considering the noise outside.
The equipement of the room is quite basic (no kettle, no mini-fridge). The bath-room is not that convinient (door opening the wrong way, no tray to put your bath gel in the shower, shower curtain that does not fit the shower so water splashs outside).",3,2016,07,06
60,Excellent,"Hotel is in an amazing central location. You walk out and you're already in the middle of the infamous Ramblas. Everything was clean and the included breakfast was great. With a friendly and knowledgeable staff, I wish I would've stayed more than just two nights. The only thing I would comment on is the A/C not cooling all that great but it didn't affect my vacation one bit. It's understandable since it's a necessity coming from Miami and I always need the air conditioning on full blast cooling. But I would definitely stay here again once I return to Barcelona. ",5,2016,07,05
60,Very good hotel,The hotel has a wonderful position on the rambla. The breakfast is good and happens in a good place in the hotel where you see the sky. The room is clean with all accessorie. The WiFi segnal is very good,4,2016,07,05
60,Nice and friendly staff. Nice location.,"Nice and friendly staff, clean rooms with a good and spacious bathroom. Good location nearby the Rambla, the beachfront, loads of restaurants and the many interesting sights in Barcelona. Even a small bar and restaurant out side. ",4,2016,07,05
60,First time Barcelona,"The hotel was located on the La Ramblas........next to EVERYTHING!!!! Great local........! We had a room with three twin beds for me and my two teenage kids. For me the bed was a little stiff, felt sore on some mornings. The bathroom was more than big enough, had both a toilet and a bidet. The shower was very good, although the curtain kept blowing around while showering.! But good water pressure!! The staff at the front desk spoke good English, and I was able to get answers to my questions easily. 
There were two ways to have breakfast, either pay in advance for the buffet style meal, which was on the first floor (pretty good breakfast) or pay as you ate per day. If  you paid in advance, you just show up, check your name on the list and let you in. If not , they just give you a bill and let you charge it to your room. But there's so many cafe's and restaurants close by to choose from.  Most breakfasts consisted of croissant and coffee, very good coffee!! Although you could get eggs, bacon, and sausage.......it was not like eating at iHop....!! Definitely a local style breakfast.........!",4,2016,07,05
60,oriente atiram,"try not to face the street, very busy.  but awesome location. very close to everything. food very close by and can walk to many locations near by. Taxi's are right across the street. Breakfast was good 

",4,2016,07,05
60,Great Hotel,"We had a very enjoyable stay at the Oriente Atirim.  The staff on the reception desk were always very helpful & pleasant, we also found the breakfast room staff to be very nice.  This hotel is conveniently located to shops, Metro & buses",5,2016,07,05
60,Excellent location in Ramblas,"Very clean hotel in great location near shopping and fine restaurants.
Able to purchase HOP OFF AND ON BUS TOUR TICKETS directly from Hotel. 
Breakfast Buffet was delicious. I would definitely stay again. ",4,2016,07,05
60,Couldn't be more central to everything in Barcelona!,This hotel is right in the centre of the Ramblas. Couldn't be a better location as everything you need is in walking distance. The staff are helpful and friendly and can speak some English. The room was adequate but good value and the breafast room and food was very good if typically of what you might expect in Spain. Beware the rip-off drinks on the pavement cafe associted with the htel as they will seerve huge drinks if you don't specify the size and the cost will be 15 Euros per drink.,4,2016,07,03
60,"A Few Hiccups, but a Good Stay","Check-in was a rather unusual process, because when I prepaid for the hotel room, my bank put a fraud hold on my card and the charge was declined, but instead of notifying me, the merchant solely notified the hotel that my card was declined and so I arrived blissfully unaware my reservation was cancelled. After some digging, this was sorted out and I was given a room at the price I would've originally booked the room at, which was a really nice thing to do.

One issue was noise. Don't get me wrong, I live in the centre of a large city, so hearing the L3 trains go by or other general city noise didn't bother me, especially because it doesn't operate 24 hours, but if you're not used to it, keep in mind you will hear it. It should be noted that the hallways are marble and so you can hear any kind of conversation that takes place on your floor outside a room. That being said, it was really only an issue due to jet-lag, so if this is your first stop after a long flight, you might find yourself a bit irritated.

Location is fantastic, La Rambla is a great axis to use to explore the city, and being a few stops away from Estació de Paral·lel you get the benefits of being close to a transfer point but not having to use it as your primary station. When it comes to La Rambla, I highly recommend branching off into side streets for food. It'll be cheaper and frankly, better.

The rooms are... Kind of weird. Maybe it was just mine, but because my room did seem a bit unique there wasn't a desk, which is fine, I've got no problem relaxing with my laptop in a bed, but the issue for this was the outlets were all across the room, which led to some interesting acrobatics on my part.

All in all, the hotel has its problems, but it's not bad, and service more than makes up for it.",3,2016,07,03
60,Happening Location & close to a Metro station in the heart of La Ramblas,"Superb location to enjoy the vibrant atmosphere of La Ramblas. Room was surprisingly big enough for an extra bed. The front desk staff can converse well in English. The location is THE place to wine, dine and shop when Barcelona. To get to the airport, you just have to drag your luggage bag for a good 20 minutes walk ( taxi less than 5 minutes) to Plaza Catalunya area where the Blue Top bus provide airport transfer to the respective terminal",4,2016,07,02
60,First time to Barcelona,"Stay in this hotel but don't drink on the main strip as it is very expensive. Some great bars just off the main drag and great location for the lovely clean beach.
More Irish bars than Dublin but great crack for the football.
Nou camp is a must do but not as good as Highbury was.",5,2016,07,02
60,You get what you pay for,"We chose this hotel as it was on La Ramblas, close to a metro station and because it was reasonably priced.  We chose room only as there are so many places to eat it seemed pointless booking breakfast too. The room was good sized clean,  smart, good condition,  but the bed was very uncomfortable but that could be because we are used to a very good bed at home.  
The view was from our room was a brick wall which amused us greatly!  Considering the location- directly on La Ramblas,  we heard no noise from outside.   
There was no air conditioning in the room but that wasn't a problem as it didn't get too hot anyway.  The room had a safe and ample hanging space for clothes.  The bathroom was well lit and had a powerful shower.  All in all it was good value for a simple, clean room which was on La Ramblas which was exactly where we wanted to be.  ",4,2016,07,01
60,4 days LAS rambles family vacation,"I traveled with my husband and 2 kids (ages 16 and 18).  Hotel has a wonderful location smack in the middle of Las Ramblas, We LOVED the location. Ok so its really crazy busy and loud on this street but we had a 4th floor room so most nights we were fine. occasionally we would hear yelling and screaming from the side street BUT all in all it was FUN... The hotel offered WIFI with worked somedays better than others. Staff was amazing we arrived early and was able to leave our luggage in the luggage closet at the front office. Allowing us to sightsee and enjoy our day without our luggage. Breakfast was pretty good. BEST COFFEE!!!!!! ",4,2016,07,01
60,very good,"I realy enjoied this hotel,Just what was needed and great location!
good prices.
thank you!!!!
I will recomend it for sure.
It has character,a very special building with history,the stuff are great.
way to go!
",4,2016,06,29
60,La Rambla!,"First off, the negative. The beds are squeeky and lightweight. If you sit up to read propped against the pillows, the whole mattress slides out under you.
Now the positives. We are a family of 4 and we got a room right on the Rambla on the first  floor. Its like being right on the street, but from the comfort of your room. The staff are couteous and helpful with suggestions and queries. The cab for Sants arrived exactly at the time requested. The gothic quarter, beaches and many more attractions are easily walkable. For the rest theres a Metro station just outside. Cabs are plentiful and reasonable (by the meter). If you can download the Mytaxi app then its a breeze. The beaches nearby are clean and cool. We spent a day at Barcelonata and I would reccomend that. The hotel has a sushi and a regular restaurant downstairs. We tried both and found them satisfactory. 
Stayed 3 nights and we didn't want to leave. Oh and did I meantion, LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION",5,2016,06,29
60,Great location Great staff,"Stayed for 4 nights during our Spanish trip. Although the hotel was right in the thick of things at a time when thousands of Frenchman came to town for the rugby our room was an oasis in a busy city. The staff were all friendly and efficient. The room was clean and a great size and all linen changed daily. We also had the added advantage of a wee balcony which we could retire to, to watch the world go by. If you want fancy surroundings this will not be for you, but if you want a great comfortable, clean and welcoming base to enjoy Barcelona and all she offers....  highly recommended.",5,2016,06,29
60,Vacation stay,The hotel was clean and the service was great. Front desk folks are great. Down side - Walls are paper thin and you hear everything from your neighbors. It is a party hotel due to the road out front. Loads of drunk guys out on the main road singing and having a great time.,4,2016,06,28
60,Good location in Barcelona,"
Good location in Barcelona, near the Rambla and Plaza de Cataluña  ,near the Metro and bus to the airport.   Friendly and helpful staff, comfortable rooms,  good breakfast for a three star.  overall more than good",5,2016,06,28
60,Perfect hotel for city getaway,"The room was very clean and well kept by the cleaners, staff were friendly enough and spoke good english. Air conditioning and wifi was free, hotel was not noisy at night despite being on the ramblas. Great central location, not too far to walk to the beach and easy to get to the airport on metro, from the liceu stop 2 mins away! Would recommend.",5,2016,06,28
60,Nights in Barcelona,"This place is right in the heart of las ramblas. It was a perfect location for our stay in Barcelona. It was in the middle of all the action. We were able to walk everywhere-- except the Sagrada Familia & Park Gueil. Nevertheless, we took the taxi to go to those places. 
When we got to our room, there was a bottle of champagne and some fruit and snacks for us. It was so nice of them to treat us for our honeymoon!
The staff was friendly and helpful!
One thing, it is TOO LOUD at night. I did not have a good night sleep. I even requested a room away from the street... and they didn't do that.
So, when you go there... make sure you get a room away from the street!",4,2016,06,28
60,Very central - breakfast not to our taste,"This hotel is in a great spot. Right on las ramblas with a 1 minute walk to the nearest metro station.

Our room was lovely. Large, great bathroom. But they only offer twin rooms. We were travelling as a couple and the only option was two single beds pushed together. 

We had a city view room which meant a small balcony facing onto las ramblas. Great people watching! It was a bit noisy at night but we got used to it.

The breakfast was not all that great. Selection of fruits, some cheese, some cold meats as well as some croissants and scrambled eggs. Perhaps we are normally spoilt for choice but I would prefer to pay elsewhere to get a better meal with more variety. I guess it was easy, but just not to our taste. 

Don't eat on las ramblas, it is too expensive and not authentic but certainly people watch from the balcony ",3,2016,06,27
60,Good hotel centrally located,The hotel was clean although a bit tired. Beds v.comfortable with nice sheets. Hotel staff were friendly and very accomodating doing both printing and phoning for me. Grat location in the midst of it all.,4,2016,06,27
60,A great City Break,"The Hotel is very clean, and provides the basics for a great City break..its centrally located and was suitable for our needs.. The breakfast was as expected although a few minor complaints from other guests about some of the food .. I would go back again purely for the location of the hotel.. and overall..A great city break",3,2016,06,27
60,A conveniently located superb facility in the heart of La Rambla,"Comfortable and large twin room with en suite facilities in an excellent stylish hotel. The dining area for breakfast was clean and beautifully decorated. The breakfast was a varied selection of food catering for all tastes.

No evening meal was provided but there are plenty of varied restaurants to choose from in La Rambla.",4,2016,06,26
60,Best location,"Staff keen to help with all enquiries on Barcelona. Increíble location. 
The Floors were refurbished and well presented, but the reception área needs to be updated.
The hotel image  will certainly improve.",4,2016,06,24
60,Great location,"The hotel is in a great location in the heart of La Rambla. Very easy to get to and around Barcelona from here. It's also a 1 minute walk from the Gothic Quarter and 10 minute walk Poble Sec if you want to escape some of the touristy nature of La Rambla.
When we arrived we were told there were no double beds available so we had been upgraded to a room with 3 singles that faced onto the street with a small balcony. Even though we were facing the street the noise wasn't a problem when the doors were closed. The room was large but we had to push the two single beds together to be able to sleep next to each other. 
Hotel is reasonably clean and comfortable, a true 3 star. Wouldn't not recommend to others coming to Barcelona for the first time but it's not necessarily the best out there.",3,2016,06,24
60,Cruiser,"Great value, location is great and the best rooms for families in Barcelona. The family rooms are small, but this adds to the ambience of Barcelona. The building is very old and very beautiful. If you love architecture like I do, this hotel is for you. The location is very close to the port and it's a 5-10 minute walk to the cruise port's public bus.  ",5,2016,06,23
60,Simple but convenient,"This hotel could not be in a better place to enjoy the Ramblas and the buzz of Barcelona. It is also very close to a Metro Station, and also walking distance for the airport bus.
It has obviously been quite opulent in the past and the few original features that remain are beautiful. It has been 'updated' and the decor is very simple and rather sparse and characterless. However you don't go to Barcelona to spend time in your room. The rooms were clean and had all that was needed, hairdryer, fridge, safe etc. Breakfast was very good, fresh and plentiful. ",4,2016,06,23
60,Wonderful stay at a great price ,"Highly recommend this hotel easy walk to the cruise port. Friendly helpful staff. Clean and comfortable rooms in a excellent area metro station just outside, laundromat 5 min walk away. Excellent area for restaurants and shopping. Highly recommended a street view deluxe room.",4,2016,06,23
60,Enjoyable 7 Night stay,"We spent  7 nights in this great hotel, from the moment we checkd in till when we checked out the servives were excellent. Especially the front desk who were friendly and helpful and assisted us will some problems which we were most appreciated. The room was clean spacious and very comfortable bedding. The only negative was the shower is not contained and makes a mess in the bathroom.
The location is excellent fior exploring Barcelona. The buffet breakfast is very good with a wide range of choice. Recommended, we very pleased that we choose this hotel ",5,2016,06,23
60,"Good location, good staff, Nice room","The hotel was nice with à Perfect wifi and a good location just near the subway and a bus station. The staff was friendly and the room was confortable
It's a Perfect hôtel to stay 2-4 days to visit barcelona !",4,2016,06,23
60,Fantastic location,"Right in the middle of las ramblas,great staff,great rooms, just needs a shelf in the shower for toiletries ,l highly recommend This hotel to. anyone not expecting a 5 star hotel , the beach and the marina are easily within walking distance , there is a fantastic restaurant under the hotel ",5,2016,06,22
60,Second time at this hotel,"Couldn't be more central.   Very clean.   Staff very pleasant..   Buffet breakfast nice and plentiful,  but a few boiled eggs wouldn't go amiss as it was scrambled egg every morning!   Room nice, but really missed having a kettle and tea/coffee.    Towels changed every day.",4,2016,06,20
60,Recent mini break,"Excellent location. Very clean and comfortable hotel. Friendly staff.
Only disappointment was the mini bar which we paid extra for and only contained cheap fizzy drinks.
Overall perfect location central to all attractions.",4,2016,06,20
60,Great location!!,"Very central and easily accessible hotel right in the middle of La Rambla. Friendly welcoming by staff. Breakfast needs to be improved as everyday is the same and more variety should be added. Walking distance to gothic quarter, catalunya and beach! Would definitely stay there again!! ",4,2016,06,20
60,A weekend break,Apart from the frosty receptionist. The rest of the staff where very friendly and helpful. I wish I had taken the evening male staff name as he was very helpful and good with my children. The room was clean but the beds hard and the pillows lacking. We were only there 2 nights so could manage. We loved Barcelona and would stay again with you.,4,2016,06,20
60,"Outsnadning hotel on the ""Ramblas.""","This was an outstanding hotel directly on the ""Ramblas,"" the center of Barcelona nightlife and dining. Staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel is beautiful and well kept. The breakfasts were ample and tasty. ",5,2016,06,20
60,A great place to stay,"This was our second stay at the Oriente Atiram, having been there at the same time last year. We liked it then and we liked it just as much this time. The rooms were clean and comfortable, and were refreshed and replenished swiftly each morning. 

The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast menu plentiful. Although the hotel was fully booked, breakfast never felt rushed or overcrowded, and the breakfast times, 7 am to 11 am, were very accommodating. 

We were happy with our experience and would happily come back. Situated as it is in the centre of La Rambla, you can't get any closer to the excitement of Barcelona. ",5,2016,06,20
60,Very good location.,"We had a 4 day visit to Barcelona and this hotel was perfect for sightseeing. It is close to all the attractions of the city and the metro. We had a 4 day travel pass and were able to use all the public transport very easily. The hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff were friendly and welcoming. The room though on the small side was perfectly adequate. We did not eat in the hotel so can't comment on the food. Overall, it proved value for money.",4,2016,06,19
60,Great location for hotel but not quiet,"This hotel was within the gothic quarter amidst lots of little alleys and near squares with great restaurants. Consequently, even with the windows closed, the place was not that quiet. Additionally, we could hear the people in the next room quite clearly. All was quite comfortable, but suggest management ensure their staff be versed in how to help guests navigate the metro system to the airport. We got a bum steer that added half and hour to our journey on the way home, which, being a person who NEEDS to be early for things, added a fair degree of stress.",4,2016,06,19
60,"My stay in Las Ramblas, Barcelona","Overall we enjoyed our stay in Barcelona, the hotel experience was as expected for a three star hotel, friendly helpful staff, reasonably clean, appears to be being refurbished. Position on Las Ramblas was good for us, able to watch lots of activity in the street below. Good location near Metro and buses. Many shops and eateries up and down Las Ramblas.",4,2016,06,18
60,Nice,"Nice hotel in an excellent location, had a room overlooking las rambles, which was great and not too noisy, staff were really friendly and helpful. Very central location near some good restaurants and bars. No frills room but very clean.",4,2016,06,18
60,Great location ,"A great location for sightseeing , shopping and for tapas bars.
The hotel is clean, and comfortable , friendly , helpful staff.
We got a nice big room, a plus when you compare with other European hotels. The breakfast was nothing much, the restaurant next door has a good breakfast . Checkin was very fast.",4,2016,06,17
60,Good location,"Excellent location, within walking distance to metro and city bus tour and harbour.
Nice cool large room and bathroom. Only problem was very hard pillows.
Staff were very helpful, giving directions and advice. ",4,2016,06,17
60,Mrs P Laing,"We stayed at the Oriente early June 2016. The staff were very pleasant and helpful particularly Fernan who booked our trip to the Sagrada Familia and a trip up Pasion tower for us. Our room was big and very clean but I suspect it was one which had not been refurbed as yet. Aircon controls were a little difficult to use as the casing kept falling off. The bed was very hard but  the housekeeping staff gave us several blankets to put under the bottom sheet which helped. We could have moved to a room with a softer bed apparently. We had a small balcony overlooking the street to the side of the hotel. It was quite noisy during the night. If we stayed again we would ask for an internal room overlooking the central courtyard.  The hotel was very well located right on La Rambla. 

We decided to pay for breakfast which was good value for money. There was plenty of choice including hot sausages bacon and scrambled eggs. Bacon was not cooked crispy enough for us though. The coffee was good. Toast, bread rolls, cereals, croissants, fruit and cold meats and cheese were also available. The dining room staff were great too. Apparently they cater for all types of dietary problems. The hotel is currently undergoing updates but that did not affect our stay. We enjoyed our stay at the Oriente.

I would have given the hotel one more star had we not had the minor problems.",3,2016,06,17
60,Nice Hotel/Central Location,"Good location for old city and port areas. Luckily happened upon a tapas fest too!
Close to Los Carracoles restaurant that always wanted to visit since seeing on Keith Floyd go there.
Clean tidy hotel, can't comment on food as had room only.",5,2016,06,17
60,Worst experience ever!!!,"My experience with this hotel was disastrous. Not reviewing the place as much as staff and managment. we were charged twice for room by their fault and when they tried to refund it they charged us again. We were were trying to resolve this problem with manager and we got only we are sorry from them. Little  to no money on our account, spent two days trying to get refund which we still didn´t get. They charged us over 1000€ but in all fairness they admit making mistake a gave us complimetary breakfast 12€.",1,2016,06,17
60,"Great Hotel for Location, Modern and Clean",Great Hotel for location. Room was very clean and modern with a good bathroom. It was a little loud at night but you are right on La Rambla so that's expected. Staff were friendly and helpful.  However the beds were pretty hard and the pillows are thin and need to be replaced. Other then that I would stay again because of cleanliness and location!,4,2016,06,17
60,"Great central location with easy access to the metro, cafes and restaurants.",We really enjoyed our few days in this very central hotel. We felt it was a great choice for us. The price was very reasonable. Everything was in walking distance. Great choice of cafes and restaurants. Room was quiet despite being on such a busy street. Room was serviced daily to a high standard.,5,2016,06,17
60,Great stay in the heart of Barcelona!,"Amazing location on La Ramblas and walking distance to just about everything. Many restaurants and bars nearby, as well as 10-15 minutes walk to the beach! 

Staff was vert helpful and friendly. Room was big enough for me and my friend with good wardrobe space and a good bed. However the only negative was the shower not being able to close, which resulted in water all over the bathroom floor. The housekeeping did great in cleaning so it did not bother us greatly. 

Overall a really good stay with great money value. Would definitely come back; especially if Josep and Enrique still work there! :) ",5,2016,06,16
60,Lovely hotel,"Perfect location for a city break. Close to the Metro, sea, Gothic quarters etc. Room spotless and cleaned every day. Plenty to choose from for breakfast.  Step out of the from door onto La Rambla. The amazing market is only a few minutes walk away as well. ",5,2016,06,15
60,Clean and Convenient,"Had 3 nights here. Hotel is right on La Rambla. We had a deluxe room which although small, has a little balcony overlooking the street and this was worth paying a little extra for. Breakfast was fine. Standard continental buffet. Didn't use the bar as there is so much choice right outside the front door. It was our first visit to Barcelona and we'd definitely return and be very happy at this hotel",4,2016,06,15
60,Hotel Oriente I love you,"Booked a Ramblas room so we could feel the atmosphere even when in the room , once we shut the doors though the double glazing kept most of the noise out and did not stop me sleeping. I was aware of the metro running  under the Ramblas but once Id figured out what it was it didn't disturb me. I thought that breakfast was included when I booked but they had no record of it. I love this hotel and would come back at any time. This is our second visit and definitely not our last. Staff are brilliant and the hotel is clean and welcoming. Love it !!!",5,2016,06,15
60,Right on La Rambla,"The location is fantastic right on La Rambla in all the action with restaurants and shops at your door, a short walk to the metro and harbour a 10 minute stroll.  The hotel is a little worse for ware our room was basic 2 single beds where the mattress had seen better days and creaked and should be thrown in the dumpster, no tea/coffee, kettle or fridge supplied and the bathroom was an OH&S issue where door had a huge gap and water flowed onto the floor the shower floor was slippery and an accident waiting to happen.  Breakfast was mediocre not much to choose for the price they asked.  Our room was expensive and for what I paid I felt I could have done better elsewhere.  Overall the room was quiet considering the location.  If you call the desk after 8pm they will not pick up.  I would recommend this hotel only for the location.",3,2016,06,14
60,After cruise,"We stayed at this hotel after a cruise and had a wonderful time. The hotel was located in the center of the city and that was great. The only disadvantage was the noisy street. Oh well, you can't have everything. The staff was very accommodating and the street wives was perfect.",5,2016,06,14
60,poor,"we did not enjoy the hotel, the room was very small the light was poor and the telephon did not work.  we did have enough shampoo and soap.  the view from the window was poor! but the staff was good and help us. ",2,2016,06,14
60,Very nice hotel and located in the heart of Barcelona.,"We have stayed at the Oriente Atiram Hotel on la Rambla in Barcelona for four days. It's a very nice hotel and located in the heart of Barcelona. The hotel crew is very nice and attending to your comfort. They speak english, so it's easy to communicate with them. We have been very satisfied with our stay at the Hotel and wish to come back again.",5,2016,06,14
60,Good for La Rambla,If you want to stay in Las Rambla this hotel is ideal but be aware it is very noisy outside nearly 24 hours a day.The hotel is clean and comfortable but the rooms lack a kettle and fridge apart from the delux rooms.,4,2016,06,13
60,La Rambla in all its glory!,"A quaint modern-ish hotel in the heart of La Rambla. Our room had a lovely little blacony overlooking the main promenade. The only downside was the noise round the clock; given the location -but that didn't bother us too much.

While it wasn't too spacious ; it was more than comfortable and well equipped with a lovely assortment of teas and coffee mixes refreshed everyday. 

The staff was extremely helpful and friendly; with great recommendations on eateries and itineraries.

Location wise- walking distance to the marina, museums etc. and to public transport, tourist buses etc.

Overall a great stay and all about the location.",4,2016,06,12
60,Oriente,"The hotel is highly recommended for staying in the center, on la ramblas. The staff was so helpful and kind in so many ways. I am a gluten free and they Happily accommodate my needs every morning. We stayed there for six nights and will defenetly go back. Room was big, clean and comfortable.  ",5,2016,06,10
60,Clean and quiet,"We're were expecting to hear noise from Las Ramblas, but good Windows to balcony kept out all noise. Only complaint was room was sparse and no chair, only bed to sit. We really weren't there long enough for that to matter much.",4,2016,06,09
60,HOTEL Oriente - Barcelona,Very good.  Rooms are clean.  A little noisy since it's on the Rambla.  Very central to many locations most tourists want to visit.  It's on the same block as the Opera house.  The metro and bus stops are very close.,4,2016,06,09
60,Great Area,Room was ok. European style small lifts/elevator. Service was slow and or they were preoccupied with their own conversations. Area was amazing if you like being in the centre of it all. Truly a great location for seeing the sights of Barcelona. Nightlife and restaurants are right with you.  Rides from the local bike guys were very affordable for us to get around. It was 7 dollars for 15 minutes and everything is within 15 minutes. The aquarium is close. The port is close. There are buskers on every corner. Would stay there again.  ,3,2016,06,09
60,Nice and centric hotel,"Hotel is very centric but room was quiet. Good location for business as well as tourism. Hotel staff was friendly and helped quickly with our questions. Beds were extremely hard, pillow was extremely low and hard.",4,2016,06,09
60,Hotel Oriente,"Clean, hospitable staff; central location. Cab from the airport @ 20 Euro but bus also available if you prefer the bus. Lots of shops and sidewalk restaurants on La Rambla, but walking distance to the Sea and the restaurants, Olympic Village, Gaugin homes, upscale shopping.",3,2016,06,09
60,Barca Break,"Stayed at the Oriente for 3 nights and had a great time,hotel was clean and the bedroom was spacious with a nice sized bathroom both cleaned every day .The Hotel is situated right on la Ramblas and everything can be visited direct from the Hotel .The Hotel staff were pleasant and very helpful, if you are thinking of visiting Barcelona  then I would recommend this Hotel , Breakfast is buffet style with a choice of English and continental",5,2016,06,09
60,Great stay at central hotel in Barca,"All staff in the hotel were friendly and helpful, from room cleaning to breakfast and reception staff. Facilities were fabulous, clean towels and bedding, room comfortable. Breakfast good variety and fresh, healthy food. Would recommend and we would certainly return to this hotel. ",5,2016,06,08
60,An Unfriendly Experience,"To charge 150 euros per night, you must have 1. a working shower that drains 2. doors that close.  This is at the very least. Forget about the poor interior design and breakfast not being included. Since the hotel is close to the Gothic Quarter and it's Europe...you have to let go of those things... but it's the simple things that don't cost anything they seemed to lack the most. The hotel staff just generally weren't helpful. There were glimmers of niceness, but it most certainly wasn't the standard. Unfortunately our experience staying at Oriente Atiram was not positive. The only real thing Oriente Atiram had going for it was it's proximity to Barri Gotic.",1,2016,06,07
60,Why is poor quality acceptable in Spain?,"This hotel is in a great location for most place's in Barcelona, the port the beach and in the opposite direction the markets, the city and some pretty good restaurants, my tip would be avoid all restaurants and bars on las Ramblas, they are terrible and have the sole purpose of ripping off tourists. (Also avoid all places that do not openly provide prices. (I paid €18 for a sandwich, my own fault but an example of what this location like)  The hotel is pretty good standard for Spain, however anywhere else in the world it's poor, 2 star at best. I'm yet to understand why these place's still seem to take as much off customers as is possible, whilst at the same time providing as little as possible in return. The hotel has no facilities, the staff are not really interested in providing good service, although they're pleasant enough it's just not expected of them i guess. If you have a room to the front of the hotel over looking Las Ramblas expect to have no sleep. Las Ramblas is a total dive i cannot stress this enough.. streets lined with prostitutes and drunks, expect noise from the same combined with traffic and emergency vehicle's until around 6am every night without fail. You will not be getting any sleep i assure you. If you're visiting Barcelona i would avoid las Ramblas all together. I have visited this area over the last 6 year's on various occasions, mostly when driving to southern spain or for meetings. Each time the area hits a new low, drugs,  prostitutes and addicts combined with people selling counterfeit products. All in open view on the streets and don't expect the police to do anything about any of it. It seems the laws that govern the rest of Europe do not apply here. There are lot's rough sleepers, beggers and drug addicts on the streets, you will be stepping around them on the way to the hotel each night. My honest advice would be visit somewhere else there is nothing good to see here and it's a dangerous place at night. Filthy place with the sole purpose of emptying tourists pockets by any means possible.. The hotel is what you can expect of a Spanish hotel, extremely basic, no interest in providing customer service. ",3,2016,06,07
60,The staff was friendly,"The hotel was clean, and offer a delicious breakfast. I recommend this hotel because it was a good experience, and is also near the ""Ramblas"", where you can buy souvenirs and you can find many restaurants. 
The hotel offers a computer if you need to print your airplane tickets. ",4,2016,06,07
60,Nice place to stay....,"I'd stay here again. Very reasonable price and ideally located only a couple of minutes from Liceu metro station. But be warned, Las Ramblas can get noisy late ight - early morning so a room overlooking the street may not be a good idea if you're not a heavy sleeper.",4,2016,06,07
60,May 2016,Had fabulous family mini break Hotel in brilliant location. Breakfast not the best my daughter age 8 wasn't impressed no condiments on tables coffee and tea awful. Reception staff helpful and friendly ,4,2016,06,06
60,vacation in barcelona,Josep is an outstanding person .  he was most helpful and freindly .. i also enjoyed my stay at the oriente atiram .... room 229 h. chiron thank you thank you thank you!!! Also Fernan was there the last day and we laughed a lot. Thank's guys and see you soon!,5,2016,06,06
60,Excellent location,Great spot. We managed to see all the attractions on foot from here. Room was clean and had everything you need. The only thing missing was tea and coffee facilities in the room so take your kettle if you like a brew first thing. ,5,2016,06,06
60,Great location for 1st time in Barcelona,"We travelled as a couple and this was our first time in Barcelona. The best thing about this hotel is it's location. Being on La Rambla there's plenty of restaurants, bars, shops, etc on its doorstep. Within 10 minutes walk there's the aerobus, hop on off buses and close to the beach. 

Other pros:
- Quiet (our room wasn't facing the street. Couldn't hear any street noise at night)
- Free wifi
- Clean 
- Staff were pleasant and helpful

Cons:
- For the cost, the room lacked some basic facilities such as iron, kettle or a little fridge
- Has a really small bar with a few stalls, not sure it can be considered a bar, but you probably won't want to spend any time there",4,2016,06,04
60,Good standards with no pretension.,"We have been using the Oriente for thirty years, so of course we like it.  Since Atiram bought it, they have spent millions on refurbishing this glorious building.  Having had a bad experience with noise in a room overlooking the Ramblas, this time we opted for an inside room.  This was very quite, but had no fridge or kettle.  So the choice is be kept awake all night at the front or sleep well at the back but wake up thinking that a monkey slept in your mouth!!  The staff are perfect.  Housekeeping is wonderful & value for money is excellent.

One word of caution.  Barcelona used to be our favourite city, but recently things have gone badly wrong on The Ramblas.  The bird sellers are gone & the wonderful human statues have been cleared out. (there are a couple of sorry looking imitations down by the Colombus statue). These colourful things have been replaced by hundreds of beggars who are often aggressive & numerous gangs of North African men loitering around & insulting the young girls.  They seem to be ignored by the Police, even though there is a massive Police presence.  There were always street vendors pushing tat, but now there is someone every ten paces firing shiny helicopters in the air or shoving 'selfie sticks' in your face.  Just as we were making the decision not to return, we went to Port Olympic & our faith was restored. a lovely area. Another pleasure which has been sabotaged is Font Magica.  The once booming sound of Freddy Mercury & Monserrat Cabella is now on minimum volume & completely loses its spectacular appeal.  Perhaps the council need to try harder to get the magic back.",4,2016,06,04
60,Great accommodation in central Barcelona,"As we had never visited the city before we booked thee hotel because jot looked authentic and the reviews were good. We were not disappointed! You literally walk out of the front door into la Ramblas and from there you can visit anywhere in Barcelona. We walked all over the city visiting churches, narrow lanes, the beach and the harbour. Found lots of reasonably priced restaurants by avoiding the main squares. The rooms were excellent and the breakfast so generous we didn't need to eat again until the evening. The hotel was undergoing some restoration when we visited but we could see many of the original features had been retained and once finished the ambiance of the dining area will be really amazing. ",4,2016,06,04
60,1 night in barcelona,"great position , fine old hotel, rooms a bit small but ok for the price. Good staff  friendly and helpful
Price charged ok but more than if I had booked with booking .com, due to booking through a travel agent",4,2016,06,03
60,too short,"one night (half a night-we left at 4 am for the airport)
was not enough
we'll be back
beds were great
room was larger than expected
staff was helpful
location was unreal(the best)
the price was reasonable",5,2016,06,03
60,1st time in barcelona,"When myself and my fiancee looked to book a hotel in barcelona we wanted good location clean hotel resonable cost. We found all three with this hotel. 

We found barcelona to be a wonderful city. When we book a city break our hotel is only our base, somewhere to go back to for 30 mins during the day/evening if we need to change/shower and somewhere to sleep for 8 hours of a night. Location was excellent on the ramblas, about a 20 minute walk to the beach and a 10 minute walk to the hop on hop off buses / airport buses. The hotel was very clean, beds done room cleaned and towells changed every day and the staff were very welcoming on arrival even though check in was 2pm we were given keys to our room at 12.40pm.

Wifi was also avaliable for free and the connection speed was great even though we were on the 4th floor some hotels only have it in the lobby. 

If i were to book to come here again which im sure we will i would definatly come back to this hotel and recommend it to my friends if they wanted a good hotel in a fab location for resonable price. ",5,2016,06,02
60,Good location but a wee bit tired.,"Great location near the bottom of La Rambla ,lots of bars and restaurants of varying quality.We had a triple room which was very basic but it was clean as was the ensuite the wifi worked well in our room which Was good to see but there is no kettle and sadly in a hot climate no fridge which are 2 basic needs in any hotel when it is hot.The staff were all very pleasant and very helpful and our room was cleaned to a good standard every day.It is noisy at night but that's because of the location and even with the windows closed you still wake up.",3,2016,06,02
60,May 2016,"We arrived about 13:30 and was welcomed by 2 friendly staff members, our room was clean and tidy they changed our towels everyday. We never booked breakfast but it looked very nice, we enjoyed are stay.",4,2016,06,01
60,Hotel,"The hotel is central for buses and metro links.  Walking distance to harbour, beaches and shops.  Las rambles has a variety of bars and restaurants. Although the hotel is a little tired inside, the rooms are clean, fresh towels in the bathroom everyday.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  We had breakfast at the hotel on the last day and it was very good.",4,2016,05,31
60,Great location. Poor condition. Staff unfriendly.,Could hear ppl in the adjacent hotel room using their toilet. This was unsatisfactory and quite unsavory for the price we paid. Their bathroom was next to the bed in our room. The walls must be paper thin. ,3,2016,05,30
60,location is good but hotel is nothing special,would not recommend this hotel. the only good thing about it was the location. bed was uncomfortable and window would not open. The bathroom was very small. cleanliness was not that great either and reception and lobby was not efficient,3,2016,05,30
60,very well located,"Excelent location.In the middle of the ramblas. Near the Plaza Catalunya, and subway station. 
Excelent staff. Very well disposed, nice and friendly
Nice bedroom. Spacious, confortable.
Very poor breakfast. 
Nice bar and food in the night",4,2016,05,30
60,Great hotel in a good location,"We stayed at Oriente Atiram for 4 nights. The room was a good size, especially considering that the hotel is in the centre of the city.
The food at breakfast was mainly continental with only minimal 'hot' food, but this wasn't an issue for us.
Our room was on the side of the building, but right near the front (we could look out from the balcony and see La Rambla.) The door was double glazed and so long as this is closed properly, there are no noise issues (and I am a light sleeper.)
As previous people have mentioned and asked, there are currently some maintenance works going on, but it is in an area that guests do not need access to and was not disruptive at all.
This hotel is perfect for anyone who wants to see all of the main tourist attractions of Barcelona. It is a 15 min walk to the beach in one direction and a 10 min walk to the Casa Batllo and La Piedra (Gaudi buildiings) in the other. The metro station is in the 'centre' part of La Rambla (The main walkway with the stalls on it) and only about a 2 min walk from the hotel. So a great hotel all round.",4,2016,05,30
60,City Break,This hotel is ideally located in the center of Barcelona. The staff are very helpful and the room was excellent. Breakfast could have been hotter. Even when we went to breakfast at 07:00 hours the food was luke warm at best.. It did not spoil our stay though. Would use again.,5,2016,05,30
60,Location is good but not the rest,"Bad breakfast buffé, everything felt old, like it's been lying there for weeks. Terrible beds, just two singels put together and with blankets instead of a real duvet. Small room, nowhere to put luggage. ",2,2016,05,30
60,Barcelona's great Hotel,"I just came back from a short vacation in Barcelona, I booked this hotel thru Hotelplan in Zurich that includen de airfare and hotel.  Thia agency put a great effor in find a hotel in the center of Barcelon because It was my first visit to the city. 

The Oriente is located at the real center of the Ramblas in Barcelona. EVERYTHING is walking distance. I came from the airport my METRO ( a very easy ride ) to a station a block away from the hotel.

The hotel staff was very kind and since I got early they havea a luggage room where you can leave you stuff.  I returned at 2pm. c/i time.

 The room was spacious, the bathroom amamzingly big. TV, WiFi (in the room ) Breakfast included ( if you request it ) . By the way  breakfast is good and enough to leave you full for the rest of the morning.

  I wiill book it again, absolutely.

 I think that is booked on line in advance the price will be cheaper. I paid kind of expensive because I did it 24 hrs before. But I am glad the agency choose this hotel for me.",5,2016,05,29
60,I won't stay here again,"Location was good but busy which is to be expected on Las Ramblas. But if I visit again I would never stay at this hotel again.  The hotel is very old and although some parts are renovated and updated, most of it is not. The rooms are old, dirty, with banged up old furniture.  Our dresser that held the TV was the worst and looked pretty used. The walls in the rooms are also VERY thin, you can hear other people and the plumbing in the neighboring rooms. We had to complain about the noise to reception.  I found it surprising also that one has to pay for the mini-bar in what is supposed to be a 3-star hotel. The mattresses are also very hard, I slept on the sleeper sofa which in itself was tilted and angled down and had a sheet with a hole in it. 

When we checked in we had a lot of luggage, I was surprised we weren't offered luggage service for our bags.  Does that happen in a 3-star hotel? I thought that happened in every hotel. 

The lifts themselves were a bit scary too, I don't know if they are just old or in need of repairs but sometimes when it stopped on a floor- the lift wasn't flush with the floor, you had to step down and out of the lift. That was scary at times. 

The breakfast was barely decent but needs vast improvement.  They do not give you REAL orange juice and pineapple juice, but rather some sort of orange punch and pineapple punch.  The breakfast also needs more fruit, besides just offering a couple of options. 

I suppose my overall rating should be ""poor"" since it did meet the bare minimum - room, service, food.  But since it is a 3-star hotel I was expecting a lot more - A LOT MORE.  The hotel needs to be downgraded to a 2 star hotel for what it offers.",1,2016,05,27
60,Good trip to bcn,"It is very centrally located for those who wanna stay at Ramblas with good vegeterian food option maoz,bollywood restaurente and bombay spicy.
My favourite restaurent was 'veg world' near Joanic metro station,lil far but amazing food",4,2016,05,27
60,Good location,"Hotel offers exactly what is advertised online. Located on the vibrant las ramblas, the hotel is in a very convenient tourist spot. (Don't let this put you off if you like a good night's sleep, we slept just fine). Overall great stay - would stay again.",4,2016,05,27
60,great stay at Oriente Atiram,"We stayed for 3 nights at the Oriente Atiram, we had a great time and i would certainly highly recommend this hotel. It is very central and easy to find. The staff were very helpful and friendly. It was my birthday when we were there and they left me a lovely happy birthday message and some little goodies in my room, which was spotless and cleaned to a very high standard every day. We just had room only, the only negative thing i can say is, it would've been good to have tea/coffee making facilities in our room, but that is the only little thing i have to say. We stayed in a room overlooking La Ramblas and it was great to look out the window and watch the world go by. I would definately stay there again.",5,2016,05,27
60,Satisfactory Hotel with good location,"I stayed at the hotel with my two sons aged 12 and 14. We are overall pleased with our stay. Beds a bit hard and breakfast somewhat pricey. Location very good, though. Close to tube station and restaurants. Staff frinedly and service minded",4,2016,05,26
60,Good hotel,"good hotel, perfect localisation, breakfast is good (can be expanded)
beds are hard to sleep on, (old matrasses)
staff is very friendly, price is good voor the value.
I would go again next time I visit Barcelona",4,2016,05,25
60,It's all about the location,"The location is really perfect on the les rambles street, near by the beach about 15 minutes walking distance. Also, it's near by Passeig de Gràcia. However, the rooms feels like a motel room. Old bed not conformable at all. The stuff was nice and friendly.",3,2016,05,24
60,Atmospheric!,"We stayed here for 4 nights last week and loved it! What a beautiful hotel right in the Middle of the best known street in Barcelona.
Our room overlooked la Rambla on the second floor. Very spacious, very clean, modern and well appointed. The balcony was big enough to house 2 adults with drinks in their hands and that's important!!
We had 3 single beds which were comfortable as were the pillows. Extra blankets if required from housekeeping. We requested extra pillows and blankets and they arrived within minutes. Pablo the maintenance man was with us immediately when we had trouble with the electrics...fantastic service from all AND with a smile!
Reception staff were outstanding, so pleasant to deal with.
We didn't have breakfast so can't comment on food but I can comment on bar prices...take your own or go out! €19 for 2 Bacardi and cokes..ridiculous. We were told to return the glasses that night, we didn't, took them in the morning!
Special mention for the lovely, hard working ladies who polished the bannister daily with brasso, you brought back a lot of happy memories for me.
Go to this hotel you'll love it but don't expect a good sleep because it's out of the question because of the situation, but having said that, the position is wonderful
Walk across to the Place Reial and stand by the fountain, look up at the beautiful architecture and get transported back to a different era..beautiful!
A little tip, if you want to see the city don't catch the red bus or you'll be bored rigid, far too long, 2 to 2.5 hours..take the blue one instead.
Three generations went on this holiday to celebrate my 60th and we couldn't have chosen a better hotel or city. Thank you.",5,2016,05,24
60,"good location, clean room, disgusting breakfast","Very good location, in the middle of Rambla, very clean room, wide bathroom, BUT DISGUSTING BREAKFAST- 4 days the same: cold scrambled eggs, UN-fry becon, some strange sausage, a little beat of ham and cheese, and if You`be luck - watermelon and melon. STAFF USELESS, especialy on breakfast, lots of talking eachother, NO CLEANING the tables, DIRT and one hopeless cafemachine. ",4,2016,05,24
60,Noise,"Good location - but a lot of street noise all night. My advice would be to ask for a room away from the street front if you want to get any sleep at all.
Also - avoid taking your wallet and phone into Las Ramblas if you can as both my brother and I were relieved of our wallets at some point over the weekend.",3,2016,05,24
60,Chic boutique,"Brilliant location. Fabulous staff - full of top tips and helpfulness, breakfast was plenty and fresh, beds amazing and the rooms were quiet, spacious and clean. Wifi wasn't great. We would come back in a heartbeat. ",5,2016,05,24
60,Oriente review,Excellent location on ramblas. Food good but breakfast only. Room view poor but away from noisy ramblas. Cracks in some corners of shower and room but facilities fully functional. Best point is really central location to rambles and metro,3,2016,05,24
60,Hopeless is the word,The worst experience so far in Spain. Only thing good is the location but there are hundreds like this.  We had booked 4 rooms and they were giving us all on diff floors until we expressed ourselves. Gave bottles of water to other guest and not to us for the same category of rooms. Dimly lit as they did not want anyone to see the short comings. Hopeless is the word,1,2016,05,24
60,Great location!,Great location on Las Ramblas.  Nice and clean rooms with great balconies and views of Las Ramblas.  I would recommend for first time travelers to Barcelona as it is close to many of the city's major attractions.  ,4,2016,05,23
60,Great base to explore the gothic quarter,Friendly staff. Perfect location in the heart of las Ramblas. Comfy and clean but very basic provision. No drink making facility in room and no hot drink facility at night. Great base for exploring. Would certainly stay again. ,4,2016,05,23
60,Great location,"Great location. Spent 5 days on vacation with family of 4 in a family room. Plenty of room, great breakfast and friendly helpful staff. It's an older hotel so don't expect a 5 star hotel. It's a great 3 star hotel for the the location and quality. It's right in the middle of all the happenings of the Las Ramblas. If you don't like crowds or want quiet stay away from the Ramblas. I would stay here again.",4,2016,05,23
60,"Location, location, location!","We stayed here mid-May for a 4 day break and couldn’t have been happier with the hotel.  It is bang in the middle of La Rambla with the port to the right and Catalunya Square to the left both within a ten minute walk.  Maybe longer as there is so much to see, for example the little stalls along the way, the bars selling massive glasses of Estrella and the market to pop in and look around (La Boqueria).   The Liceu metro is a couple of minutes’ walk away and you can get a 1 day pass for €9.95 which gives you 10 trips  (if there is 2 of you put it in the machine, let one of you walk through then put it back in for yourself, you don’t need a pass each).  You can also get 2, 3 or 4 day passes if you need.   It’s an easy system to use to get around.  We also took the hop on hop off bus tour which picks up in Catalunya Square, this was busy and it took 3 buses before we could get on upstairs which is necessary as you don’t see much if you sit downstairs.  Gothic Quarter (Barri Gotic) was only around 10 minutes’ walk away as well.

The hotel itself is a very attractive and impressive building and was apparently used in a film, The Passenger with Jack Nicholson.  After reading reviews we decided to book a deluxe room on La Rambla which was a good choice as it also gave us tea and coffee facilities.  The room was spacious and clean with a safe in the wardrobe which cost us €7 for 4 days.  If I was to be picky it could be because there was no mirror above the dressing table and no drawers in the room but I quite easily used the bathroom mirror as there was a socket in there.  The beds were slightly on the firm side but we slept well enough and got used to them.  It was noisy but only if you opened the balcony doors but not when they were shut on the night and we used earplugs anyway just in case.  It was quite weird to hear and feel the metro going underneath us but we got used to that gentle rumbling in the night!  We had to print some more tickets out for the Sagrada Familia and the reception staff quite happily helped us on that, they worked very hard as it was a busy place but never seemed to get flustered and were pleasant and helpful at all times.  We never used the dining room so I can’t comment on the food.  The wifi was a good connection and free.  Throwing the balcony doors open when we got back in the afternoon and soaking up the atmosphere from outside was great!

We got a taxi from the airport which should have been €29 (it states this clearly on the side of the taxis) but we were charged €35 as it was a bank holiday.  We ordered a taxi to take us back to the airport and he charged us €39!!  We don’t know why as we don’t speak Catalan and he didn’t speak any English so it might be worth taking the airport bus which goes from Catalunya Square.

All in all it was a great choice of hotel and would definitely recommend it bearing in mind we had a deluxe room.  For location I’m sure it can’t be beaten and probably made our holiday a 10 out of 10.",5,2016,05,23
60,Ideal base for a short trip to Barcelona,This is a nice hotel situated right on the Ramblas. Ideal base for the port area and the Gothic district and all the small alleys streets that are there. Could not fault the hotel for the 4 days we were there.,4,2016,05,23
60,great hotel,lovely location at end of ramblas. i have stayed in many hotels in ramblas but would recommend this one with a more quieter location and great showers with bathtub in most of its rooms. rooms not very big but very comfortable with good internet.,4,2016,05,22
60,Information requrst,"I am staying at this hotel next weekend, booked a family room. Can anyone tell me if there are tea and coffee facilities and a kettle in the room? Also where is best to book a HOHO bus tour, is it cheaper on line before I arrive. Looking forward to my stay thanks to the positive reviews on here.

60,Barcelona trip,"located in very central location for eating and drinking. Near to transport links and sightseeing tours. The rooms were large with very comfortable beds which had lovely crisp clean sheets. Also a lovely breakfast was provided. 
Would definitely return to this hotel on our next visit to Barcelona
",4,2016,05,21
60,place of it is super,The hotel is old but its place is very good to reach every touristic places. The rooms were clean but the beds were old. We did not have breakfast . the hotels price is not cheap. I recommend it if you travel with children or you are old or you do not like to travel metro etc.         ,3,2016,05,21
60,Centrally located hotel.,"Comfortable, spacious and clean. Excellent central location with good access to top tourist sites. Only let down by very poor breakfast. Cold ""hot food"". We found better out in the bars. Friendly staff",4,2016,05,19
60,Great location--average hotel,"The hotel is in a great location to walk to shopping, restaurants, etc.  We were a little disappointed in the hotel itself.  It was adequate, but very basic.  The rooms were small, the bathroom hard to use, and the breakfast was terrible.  The down side of the location is that it was noisy at times.  The staff was very accommodating and friendly.",3,2016,05,19
60,Lovely hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"Would definitly recomend it to anyone travelling to Barcelona, lovely staff, the prices are affordable, clean rooms and a great area in la Rambla. As for myself, I will book there everytime I will visit Barcelona.",5,2016,05,19
60,Brilliant,"Had a lovely stay here, very comfortable. For the price, cannot knock the stay at all. Decent but basic decor, comfortable beds, and very friendly and helpful staff. The location is perfect and the small balcony allows you to soak up the  atmosphere of the busy Las Ramblas even from your room. Would recommend to others and stay here again. 

Cheapest way to get to the hotel is to take the metro from the Airport to Passag De Gracia. And then change to line 3 (green) to go to Liceu station which is a short walk to the hotel (confirm with ticket office at airport)
Cost: €9.90 per person (which also gives u 10 stops usage of metro on other days)
Duration: About 45mins to 1 hour. ",5,2016,05,19
60,A great location to stay in Barcelona,"The location is as good as it gets in Barcelona, being right in the middle of Las Ramblas. The hotel is old and is being upgraded at a steady pace. The rooms are large and have AC and are wheel chair accessible. They provide a breakfast option that is good with plenty of selection.
The pros are:
Location
Breakfast
Roomy
Plenty of Character
The cons are:
The bed we had was hard and was 2 singles
The showers are large but can have overflow problems.
The rooms are old and show it.
I would stay there again but you had better be able to handle a FIRM bed. The location is amazing.",4,2016,05,18
60,Great week in Barcelona,The location of this hotel was brilliant on Las Ramblas   We were there with two other couples & we got the bus from airport to the square & hotel was about 10 minute walk from there   Rooms were good size & clean.

It's my 5th time in Barcelona and I enjoy it very much and love the city. I will come back.",5,2016,05,18
60,Loved it!,"We stayed here for 4 nights in December. The hotel was just 3 mins walk (with my huge backpack) from Lucia station, very convenient. It was in the centre area of La Ramblas. So many activities, theatres, restaurants, bars, cafes and shops around. The hotel provided excellent services. Breakfast was good. Room was big and clean. We booked the room with window which opened to the front street of the hotel.",4,2016,05,17
60,Fantastic location!  Great value. Right on La Rambla.,"This is a modest hotel at a great location in the heart of La Rambla.  Very clean room, large bathroom, closet, and safe.  The staff was very accommodating and helpful.  I would definitely stay here again!

If you are looking for a quiet room, ask not to face the street as it is quiet noisy way in to the mornings. We didn't care, though, our balcony view was worth the noise.",4,2016,05,16

60,Loved the Oriente Atiram location in Barcelona,"We stayed at the Oriente Atiram after a cruise (four couples).  The location of the hotel could not have been better.   It was right on Las Ramblas and extremely easy to walk around to visit various sites and restaurants.  Since our room was overlooking the Las Ramblas, it was fun to watch all of the activity at various times of the day...and night.   We would stay here again....it was just perfect for us!",5,2016,05,16

Hotel was clean, rooms were big, staff were lovely. 

Would definitely recommend to friends. ",5,2016,05,15
60,Classic city centre hitel,"The perfect location in the heart of Barcelona for both sightseeing and shopping. The hotel was full of character and typical Spanish charm and spotlessly clean. Breakfasts were excellent. Our only adverse comment was the noise late at night from le Ramblas,but a small price to pay for being in city centre,and would not deter us from thoroughly recommending the Oriente Atiram.",5,2016,05,15
60,Lovely experience,"Lovely experience, reception staff were very helpful. Lovely traditional/classic hotel, room was on the small size and a shame the breakfast staff couldn't have been a little more friendly. Hotel was really central to everything",4,2016,05,14
60,Fabulos hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"Beautiful old building that used to be a monastery, with fabulous staff, clean rooms and great position on la Rambla; half way down, so very easy access to the whole city. There were works at the hotel while I was there ( May 2016), and our bedroom maybe wasn't  finished to the highest standard, but it didn't spoil our stay.
Beautiful old building that used to be a monastery",4,2016,05,14

60,Great location,"Very good location right on La Rambla, few minutes walk to the market where we get juice from every morning for breakfast. My second time using this hotel, and will most likely go back again if I visit barcelona again in the future. Express check in and out. Friendly and approachable staff. Elevator available. Quiet room even though nearby the busiest street. Fast and reliable free WiFi. Clean and spacious room. Daily room service, basic toiletries provided. Only annoying thing is shower box glass could not cover the water splashing out from the shower hence flooding the floor every time after shower. Otherwise great shower pressure and hot water.

60,lovely break,Hotel clean and comfortable. Convenient for sight seeing. Staff friendly and helpful. Hotel is currently being refurbished. Buffet breakfast suitable for all tastes. House keeping staff very thorough.,4,2016,05,13
60,A nice ending to an amazing cruise,Had a week on the new Ovation of the Seas and stayed in this hotel for 3 days to cpmplete the holiday. Very basic hotel but perfect location.

60,Barcelona Lovely Weekend,"We were in Barcelona a few months ago or a weekend just a touristic Londoner stuff with the gang. We turn up at reception around 19:00 and the welcome was lovely. I would like to mentioned one guy from the North I believe I remeber that his name was Fernand or Ferran something like that....he was so pleasant and smiley and gave us very good advises about the City...I never forget the food in one of the restautants he recommended to us. One place called ""La Flauta"" close to Universitat.",5,2016,05,13
60,Balcony door needs to be fixed,"Place was nice for tourist. Unfortunately, the balcony door had a gap when the door was closed causing noise from outside leak into the room. This made it hard to sleep at night. Wifi was slow. Room was clean! ",3,2016,05,12
60,Oriente Atiram Hotel,"Excellent. We were extremely happy with the hotel and staff. Lovely location right in the centre of Spain, the Rambles. Staff were well equipped to answer any travellers queries. I never rights reviews and always believe that the higher price you pay you simply cannot get disappointed. I have booked this hotel in the very last minute so I t cost me a bit but I have no regrets. . ",5,2016,05,12
60,Good Location - Needs some improvement,"Great location for touristing in Barcelona. 
It was a bit noisy for me, but maybe that's just me.The staff was capable and experienced with American or English tourists, so that's good. Breakfast was a good, good variety and able to get in and out ok.

",3,2016,05,12
60,Thank You for your hospitality,"Thanks to the hospitality of the staff especially Fernan and Enrique when they helped us to get our car back when the city towed our car a few blocks away.
Breakfast was very good and we get also enough coffee which is very important in the morning ☺",5,2016,05,12
60,it could be better,"quite normal in all but it was a noisy (not from the street but from the inside) and it was cold but we can't turn on heating the room. also there were 2 beds instead of 1 but i guess it wasn't hotel problem. 
everything else was fine, thanks for great holidays! ",3,2016,05,11
60,Nice rooms on La Ramblas,"Location in a middle of La Rambla , big rooms, good, helpful staff. They upgraded our room because of previous stay. Provides good breakfast. Close to the port 5 minutes and airport only 20 minutes ride. ",5,2016,05,11
60,Stay somewhere else,"When we arrived after an 8 hour flight we waited hours for our room, which can be expected. When I was finally taken to my room I was highly disappointed. The room looked like one you would find in a hostel and did not resemble the pictures in any way. We paid for a quad and was given a pull out couch that i wouldn't let my dog sleep on. I insisted on a better room (which i thought i had paid for already) We were finally given a decent room. Nothing special, but the location made up for it. My advise is to book the upgraded room. ",2,2016,05,10
60,"Great Location, but very noisy!","Fabulous location, good breakfast, very nice staff, terrible beds, Ramblas room romantic with street access, but noisy, clean, but no heat in May even though necessary, interesting international clientele. ",3,2016,05,10
60,Good Hotel,"A very good hotel. Plain but clean rooms, ours faced La Rambla. Breakfast was adequate if a bit plain also from 7am to 11am so no rush...
I would have given five stars but for the fact we had to wait for an hour for our room to be cleaned and made ready!
Not good having travelled so far and done some sightseeing before getting to the hotel...
But don't let this put you off if you want a reasonable quality hotel on La Rambla! ",4,2016,05,10
60,Great location,"Nice room, very friendly personnel and the location is great. We could use a guest computer to check in for our return flight and when that didn't work we could use the computer behind the desk. Breakfast we don't know, we bought that at La Boqueria.",4,2016,05,10
60,Bad temperature and very bad breakfast,"Value for money - under mid level
Very bad breakfast - some days yoghurt and some days not - as an example
Nice staff and friendly
Very cold room - no heating - not possible to keep the warm in the nights

",3,2016,05,09
60,Excellent location,"The location of the hotel is excellent, right in the middle of La Rambla, the main pedestrian street. If you want to live and explore the Barcelona spirit, this hotel is excellent for that purpose.  Room we stayed was clean, but the bed was not very comfortable. I was expecting for king sized bed, but it was two normal beds pushed together, which was not maybe the most comfortable bed for a couple. Beds were also a bit too hard, but the room was otherwise very nice, so it did not matter too much. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast is of good quality, though not very wide selection of different food is served. Hotel wifi functions perfectly, and is suitable for light browsing. This is not a luxury hotel, but the location raises it above average in my opinion.",4,2016,05,09
60,Ideal location,"Ideal location on La Rambla, very central. Large room, very clean. Well appointed, spacious bathroom but the shower didn't work properly. We were on the 2nd floor but the rumble from the Metro running underground kept us awake at night & the walls were so thin you could hear the people talking in adjoining rooms. Wifi was available in the room. Staff weren't very friendly or helpful on arrival, we probably wouldn't use it again.",3,2016,05,06
60,Great location.,The orient atiram is situated on la rambla close to the gothic quarter and port. A beautiful building but in need of a bit of a refurb inside. Rooms basic but clean. Towels/bedding changed each day. Hotel staff were friendly and really helpful. Brilliant base for getting round the wonderful sights of Barcelona. ,4,2016,05,06
60,we  returned,"We decided to return to the hotel because of the location. Right on the Rambla. Easy to find and easy to go anywhere from here. The hotel has ben renovating the rooms and public areas and you can see and feel the diffence. The convenience to reach restaurants, the bus station, the underground, can walk to the Bouqueria, to the port etc..is certainly e rason we chose this hotel again.

",4,2016,05,06
60,Great location!,"This Hotel is great for the location, right in the middle of La Rambla.  But beware of the noise if you are at the front of the hotel.  But perfect for all amenities. Staff very helpful and friendly and moved us to a quieter room at the back of the hotel.  Although the view of the fire escape was not so pretty, it was quiet! ",4,2016,05,06
60,it was okay but pricey,"The location was convenient to see the city.  However, the room itself was very basic.  It was definitely not worth more than 50 euro.  I paid aprx 115 euro/night.  I was freezing during the night and had to strip the second bed to use an extra blanket.  Only shampoo and body wash was available.  No lotion.  No refrigerator or coffee machine.  Very basic.",3,2016,05,05

60,Perfect Location,"This hotel is not 5 star nor does it claim to be, but the hotel is practical for anyone wanting to tour round Barcelona city.

The self service food trays were constantly being replenished ",4,2016,05,04

60,would certainly recommend this hotel,"The location was great, we had a room overlooking Las Rambla  which was a good size, good size bathroom and we found the beds comfortable.  A lovely breakfast room with a great selection of food to suit everyone. We arrived 17 April and there was a Barcelona football match on that evening but I can't say that the noise bothered us too much.  Overall a great hotel and location.",5,2016,05,04
60,Good basic hotel in a great location.,Perfect location to explore the city. Basic room but very clean. Friends we travelled with were dissatisfied with noise in room from adjoining rooms but hotel staff were happy to move them straight away.

60,Unfriendly service ruined our birthday trip,"The hotel was clean and the breakfast that  we ate one morning was a reasonable english breakfast. But and a very big but was a staff's rudeness,in particular, a young woman with eye glasses. When we arrived at the hotel, she did not wished us to welcome, did not smile and was very busy. I had told beforehand that my husband will meet his 60 years, and we expected a little thoughtfulness. Especially, because he had just won his cancer. We got nothing. On Saturday, when we were leaving, the hotel comers were given roses. For us, not even the glass of Cava as a welcome drink when we arrived (my husband does'nt drink, but as a nice quest) . When we were leaving and paying our one breakfast, we were attempted to charge the second time from our three overnight at the hotel. We had already paid the hotel when booking it by Hotels.com.  Much traveled we have never experienced so rude service. Fortunately, we did not need anything special and have things clear. For us, also, nobody presented any visit tips or something 'nice to know' of th city. Pity those, who were expecting something like that from this hotel.The service consists of small things, and each customer is worth that effort.",2,2016,05,03
60,Barcelona in April,"Great Location,  step out the door and your where all the action takes place!!!!   Loved being close to Gothic Center, and all the shops and  restaurants.
Staff so helpful, really appreciated the help.
Our Room was very clean and quiet.",5,2016,05,02
60,Lovely hotel,"We stayed here for my husband's 40th birthday trip to Barcelona. Nice, clean hotel & very friendly staff. We didn't actually use the restaurant but the food smelled lovely. 
We would definitely return to this hotel as it had a great central location on La Ramblas. 
It made our week.",5,2016,05,02
60,Very good with a few things to keep in mind,"The location of this hotel is really what makes it great. Right on Las Rambla, just step outside and you are in the center of the hustle and bustle of the city. No less than 3 separate parades went by our room in less than 36 hours. The benefits of the location were added to by our balcony overlooking the street. 

As an American who speaks very limited Spanish, it was nice most of the staff spoke English well. Things to keep in mind are: the beds in the standard room are not great. Really just a mattress with sheets, none of the pillowtop you are likely to find in most American hotels now. Also (don't know if this is standard) but our room was very small. Barely big enough for our luggage and ourselves, although the bathroom was nice and big. In addition, the proximity of the hotel and the balcony means that it is loud. If you need quiet to sleep, bring earplugs. 

The room breakfast is served in is a glorious enclosed courtyard with natural lighting. They have both American and European staples. 

As a whole, a great hotel!",4,2016,04,29
60,Excellent Hotel,"Great location, very clean and comfortable hotel although not the most modern hotel this hotel had a fabulous atmosphere, the safety deposit box was free, the shower was one of the best I have encountered and the staff were very helpful especially with internet access the breakfast would suit all pallets.",5,2016,04,29
60,Oriente,"Over all we were very happy with our stay here. 
Rooms basic but clean. 
Centre of La Rambla for easy access to many attractions in the area. 
Visit to the market and the cathedral of Barcelona is a must ",4,2016,04,29
60,Superb hotel!,"A fantastic long weekend stay at the Hotel Oriente in a great central location. Friendly, kind and efficient staff in a welcoming and warm atmosphere. Modern facilities, clean, spacious and full of light. Comfortable beds. Very enjoyable dining experience in the spacious dining room. Very good breakfast.",5,2016,04,28
60,Great value for money in a perfect location .,"A lovely hotel, perfectly located on Las Ramblas.  Walking distance to most places . Spacious rooms, simple but very clean. Staff were very friendly and helpful at all times.  Breakfast was also good and the breakfast room delightful.",4,2016,04,28
60,Perfect location for exploring Barcelona pre- and post-cruise,"We stayed at the Oriente Atiram on March 15, 2016, the day before embarking on the Norwegian Epic for a 12-night western Med cruise, and again after returning to Barcelona on March 28, 2016.  Following an easy pre-booked airport transfer through Sun Transfers, we arrived at the hotel around noon.  As expected, it was too early for check-in so the helpful staff checked our baggage into a large storage room adjacent to the lobby and we set off to explore the city until the jet lag kicked in!  It was an easy ten-minute walk to the Colombo Statue and our first look at the beautiful port.  We wandered around for two more hours and headed back to the hotel, finalized check-in, received two bottles of water and headed up to our 4th floor Rambla Room.  The room was simple and comfortable with a gorgeous view of La Rambla from our little balcony.  After freshening up we walked to the Playa de Catalunya, found a lovely little Italian restaurant for dinner, and finally, feeling our exhaustion, went back to our room for a good night's sleep.  The bathroom was good, shower water pressure and hot water excellent, and the bed was comfortable enough.  Yes, believe everything you've heard about the noise of the Rambla from the rooms overlooking the busy street.  Our arrival night coincided with the FC Barcelona - Arsenal match, and the partying and songs went on until the wee hours.  We were so tired after flying from the US that we managed to get some sleep, but if you're a light sleeper, choose a courtyard room.

The next morning, we enjoyed the buffet breakfast in the charming atrium, included with our room.  The hosts were so accommodating, and we especially loved the fresh baked goods and the AWESOME espresso/cappuccino machine that I wish I could have in my house!  Other buffet items included assorted breakfast meats, yogurts, English-style breakfast items, and some honestly pretty bad scrambled eggs.  But seriously, I can still taste the croissants and brotchen!  Following breakfast, the friendly and accommodating desk clerks phoned for a cab to the cruise port, and we were on our way.

Post-cruise, we took a cab from the port to the hotel, arriving around 10:30 am.  Once again we dropped our bags and being fresher and having more time, decided to catch the Hop On, Hop Off red bus, with a stop only a five minute walk from the Oriente Atiram at the end of La Rambla, for a more thorough look at Barcelona, the wonderful Gaudis, the Olympic stadium, Park Guell, Camp Nou, and the awe-inspiring Sagrada Familia.  After dinner we settled back into the hotel, watched some TV (a channel for every language; English language channel is Sky News from the UK; there's a terrific informative Barcelona Sights channel in English as well), finished off a bottle of wine we'd bought along the way, and attempted to sleep.  Once again we were on the 4th floor in a Rambla room and must admit it was quite loud on the street that Monday evening and we didn't sleep very well at all.  But you know what?  It was all kind of wonderful and exciting, and the memory is so vivid that I don't even mind.

The next morning we had a 10:30 am flight and following another yummy buffet breakfast, asked the clerks for a cab.  At this time of day they suggested it might be faster just to step outside, which we did, and within moments a taxi pulled up and took us to the airport, about a 20 minute ride.  He was probably the friendliest cab driver I've ever, ever met, and I wish I could remember his name.  We chatted all the way and it was getting a little sad, looking behind us and watching Barcelona, one of the most welcoming and beautiful cities of Europe, fade away.

I'd happily stay at the Oriente Atiram again.  The rooms are perfect for the price, you couldn't ask for a better location, La Rambla is intoxicating, and although we tried our best to utilize our broken Spanish, every staff member was friendly and so accommodating and easy to communicate with in English.  The Oriente is historic, charming, and just about perfect for your Barcelona trip.  Hey, if it's good enough for Jack Nicholson in ""The Passenger,"" it's good enough for you, right?  Happy Trails!",4,2016,04,27
60,Europe on a Budget,This hotel was perfectly located in the center of Las Ramblas.  It was near restaurants and tourist attractions.  Taxis and Buses were accessible.  The room and hotel was clean but the furniture in the entrance needed cleaning.  We arrived every night late and it was well lit and safe. The price was right and it included a mini bar.  The room was huge compare to European rooms and we had a balcony that allowed us to see and hear the excitement of Las Ramblas.  If you want a clean and spacious room and reasonable this is the place.,4,2016,04,27
60,Barcelona experience,"Hotel is very well positioned in the bustling area of Ramblas, but internally the hotel is very peaceful and clean. It is a great base to start. easily acessible to all areas of the city. Historic buildings and Historian's paradise. The hotel is surrounded by Tapas Bars, Coffee Shops and Restaurants. It also hosts many shops, close to the beach and other areas of interests.   ",4,2016,04,27
60,4 days in Barcelona,"This hotel is in a great location to experience many of the key sites in the city. It is in walking distance of the Gothic Quarter, Palau Guell and the port area. The metro is close by. It is clean and comfortable and the breakfast was very good. The staff were efficient, very helpful and friendly. We really enjoyed our stay.",4,2016,04,27
60,"If you can afford another place,  stay elsewhere","Do not stay in this hotel!!! The staff is unfriendly and rude. The hotel is under construction with dust and noise during the day so if you want to sleep in after a nights out, forget about it. The AC is not turn on so you have to sleep with the windows open which it wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't because Le rambles doesn't sleep (you won't either, extremely loud and im not a light sleeper) If you can afford another place, go for it. Lots of restaurants in that area.",1,2016,04,26
60,Excellent overall,"Excellent location near everywhere, large spacious room and extremely helpful and pleasant staff.  Everything changes outside at 11/12pm with stag and hen door and hookers but that did not affect us as in the hotel by that time.",5,2016,04,26
60,Barcelona,"The room was spacious and very clean; however, the bed was rock hard and the pillow was totally flat. Staff was very friendly, breakfast was delicious, hotel close to most sites we wanted to see. We would definitely stay here again.",4,2016,04,26
60,Would highly  recommend the Hotel Oriente Atiram,"Excellent position - short distance from Catalunya Square for buses to and from airport, plus city tour buses.  Also good selection of restaurants, superb markets.  The beaches and seafront were close by and there is an excellent flamenco show near the hotel.  ",5,2016,04,26
60,A great base for my stag do,"A great and a perfect location right in the heart of Las ramblas. The staff were really friendly and very helpful. I would urge anyone who wants to visit Barcelona to stay in this hotel as it's at the centre to most attractions, restaurants and bars.",4,2016,04,26
60,Great Hotel,Thank you for making our first Barcelona experience a memorable one. Everyone was at their best when it came to customer service. I would recomend your hotel to my friends in a heartbeat. Excellent staff.,5,2016,04,26
60,Great hotel.,"Hotel in good location. Reception staff efficient. Room cleanliness good. Bed comfortable. Bathroom almost perfect (just be careful with the shower, it was easy to spray water out of the enclosure because the entrance was wide and the shower stream strong). The place had a nice vibe.",4,2016,04,26
60,Great start to a pre-cruise,"Excellent location. Hotel is a bit dated, but very clean. Staff couldn't have been nicer, very welcoming.  Our room overlooked the Main Street, only problem the coffee machine was placed on a table with no way to plug it in, had to move it to where the tv & fridge were, don't understand the wall it was originally placed against didn't have any outlet.  Would go back. ",4,2016,04,25
60,Amazing ,"This hotel is located in the best spot in Barcelona, right on las ramblas. We got upgraded to a balcony room looking directly out to the street. The only downside was there was construction going on in the hallway all 3 days we where there and it was extremely loud and uncomfortable. Besides that I highly recommend staying here.",4,2016,04,25
60,"Average Quality, Rude & Unappreciative Hotel","We booked a large Stag Do party of 28 well behaved 30-45 year old men. No trouble from us at all, just a large spending group of guys. Booked through Booking.com who's policy showed this hotel as 'Free Cancelation up to 24 hours before check in'.

Out of so many rooms we had booked, unfortunately 1x room (two people) couldn't make it so we expressed our wish to use the cancellation. 

Booking.com told us the Hotel isn't allowing us to cancel. We contacted the Hotel who said it was in their own small print terms and conditions. This shouldn't matter, because we didn't book directly, so it should fall to the T's & C's via Booking.com.

They still refused to refund us but offered free breakfast for our stay instead.
Unfortunately due to a Best Man family bereavement, we didn't want to cause any further fuss so just accepted the breakfast and all had to pay extra to cover the room charge. (So in effect, not free at all).

As you can imagine, on a Stag Do of 28 guys, there was very little attendees come Breakfast time every day we were there. In fact, only 4 people made it on average each day. That's quite some saving the Hotel have had!

Anyway, check out day comes and at least half the group do actually make it to Breakfast only to be told we have to pay. We argued that it's been pre-approved, but standing at the Breakfast doors with everyone watching can get embarrassing, so whilst I myself did manage to get the authorisation called through with an 'okay', others gave up and just signed the form intending to discuss with reception upon check out.

The lady on reception who looked a senior member of staff refused to accommodate the prior agreed gesture and charged everyone EUR 12.50 each. I stepped in to disagree and her only answer was ""Did you pay?"" I said no. ""What is your room number"" to which I said, it doesn't matter because I've checked out already and I would have refused to pay anyway....

She just glared at me sarcastically clapping her hands at me.

I was disgusted at her attitude, the lack of appreciation of business we had brought to this hotel and the disappointment of going against the offer of a free breakfast (which wasn't actually free anyway!).

I'd never stay at this hotel for this reason alone, let alone the building work going opposite our room which in hindsight is clearly needed in a very run down basic 2* at best hotel.",2,2016,04,25
60,wonderful stay in Barcelona,"we didn't know we had to put our room key in a slot by the door to operate the lights. everything was within walking distance.  Plenty of restaurants, be sure to visit La Familia and the Market.  walked over the bridge, not too much there but a nice walk.  We'd recommend going back to Barcelona and would stay in Oriente Atiram again. ",5,2016,04,21
60,Overpriced low budget hotel,The hotel had a excellent location but the standard did not reflect the price. Overpriced low budget hotel with low standard on the rooms. The sheets never changed and the room interior was like motel,2,2016,04,21
60,"Location, Location","The hotel is situated at approximately mid point of the Ramblas, close to the metro, bus stops and a taxi rank  The rooms are light and airy, they are well appointed and kept to a high standard.  The staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  This was my second stay at the Oriente and would not hesitate to book again.",5,2016,04,21
60,The first and oldiest,"It is not usual to enjoy services in the oldiest hotel in town. Among celebrities who contributed the hotel's image, there is a Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen. Today, hotel offers decent accomodation, on the best location, and the old day's glory helps to overcome eventual inconvenience.",5,2016,04,21
60,Great Location,The location is great but the room could be better.  Shower is too small and has no exhaust so you need to open the window.  Centralised heating and cooling makes it harder to set your own desired room temperature.,3,2016,04,19
60,First trip to Barcelona,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and hope to return one day. Room clean and bright  and there was sufficient storage. Central situation of the hotel  enabled us to walk everywhere easily. The only drawback was the noise made by people on the floor above packing at 1.30 a.m. and wheeling their suitcases across the floor.,4,2016,04,19
60,Very good,"Our stay in the hotel was very satisfactory, it is on the Rambla, so it the heart of Barcelona and very near to the metro and the bus. The people speak most languages good, so that's not a problem. The room was good and clean. It's also very near to supermarkets. Overall we are very satisfied with our stay in the hotel.",5,2016,04,19
60,Great plus a neat surprise,"After returning from a long day in the city a little surprise birthday treat for my fiance was waiting in the room which was very nice and thoughtful. Otherwise, great location, good price, clean room. ",5,2016,04,19
60,Knapp trip Barcelona NCL,See Room Tips below. Does not seem to be very handicap accessible. Could use some warm blankets in the room. Location was great on Rambla Street. Outdoor cafes across the street were friendly and accommodating. La Finda a very good restaurant. ,5,2016,04,19
60,Second visit - as good as the first!,"First visit was to experience the fabulous architecture and enjoy the culture. 
Second visit was to enjoy a Barcelona FC match and a more leisurely holiday. 
Both were excellent. 
Hotel is ideal for location everywhere is walkable or metro for the Camp Nou trip. 
Hotel very helpful - they did our return flight check in for us. The breakfast room has a glass atrium roof which was lovely and bright. Only downside was poor choice for gluten free breakfasts.",4,2016,04,19
60,Fantastic stay.,"We had a standard room no 403. We were 2 people and got one double bed and one single bed. Great sized room. Quiet and clean. Helpful staff. Stayed here before, and can recommend the breakfast as well. I will book this hotel again for sure. ",5,2016,04,19
60,Spot on,"Just come back from a weekend break in Barcelona, including watching Barcelona FC at Nou Camp. We booked the trip through an agent who booked everything for us. We just wanted a hotel on Las Ramblas, he gave us a few to choose from. We chose the Orient Atiram and we were really happy with it. We arrived quite late at night and the room we were allocated was overlooking a car park. We asked if it was possible to be changed to a room overlooking Las Ramblas. They duly did this the following morning. They are slowly doing renovations, so some of the areas are a little 'tired', but it didn't spoil anything at all. We had room only, but did have breakfast there one morning, which was fine with plenty of choice. Would definitely stay there again.",4,2016,04,19
60,Great location,"Great location on the ramblas. From the airport coach drop off its about a 15 minute walk. The airport transfer is very cheap and quick. 
Our room was spacious and clean. We stayed in a basic room with no breakfast. Next time we would book a room with a balcony as these have tea and coffee facilities where as the basic rooms don't. I would also pay extra for breakfast as it was quite expensive to eat on the ramblas. There was a fridge in our room which was handy.
The only downside was the noise from people coming in at all hours, maybe some notices would be useful reminding people that guests maybe sleeping and to be considerate- this was at like 3am on a Wednesday. 
Opposite the hotel across the road is Place Real which was lovely to sit in the evening with lots of bars and restaurants. 
Would definitely stay at this hotel again.",4,2016,04,17
60,Good Hotel in Excellent Location,My husband and I stayed here during a recent city break and found the hotel to be very nice. We were booked in for room only so didn't eat in the hotel but found the hotel very clean with rooms cleaned and fresh towels provided every day. The staff were also very helpful and would book taxis etc if you needed the them. The location of the hotel is fantastic on La Ramblas so it is very easy to get about and you are very close to lots of shops restaurants etc. The only problem we had was that the room was very warm even though there was air conditioning it wasn't  very strong which made room stuffy. My husband mentioned this to reception staff but was advised that it was on the winter setting and therefore cldnt be changed apparently in May it will change to summer setting and will be stronger. Other than that we had a great break and would recommend this hotel.,4,2016,04,16
60,Perfect city break.,"Ideal location for a short break, 2 minutes from the Metro and slap bang in the middle of things.The room was quite small but clean and comfortable. This was not a problem as we didn't spend much time in it. The best part was the location, we had a first floor balcony overlooking the Ramblas. Perfect for the sights, sounds and smells whilst sitting outside to take in the atmosphere.",5,2016,04,16
60,Barcelona 2016,We stayed here on a room only basis in April 2016. The hotel is right on La Rambla which was perfect for us and very central. The room was clean and spacious and had some nice wee touches for our arrival. Have recommended to a a friend already! ,5,2016,04,14
60,ALL IN ALL : GREAT HOTEL,"The staff are very friendly .. GREAT location by the Rambla .. every thing is as you should expect .. 
Two small issues : no irons in rooms .. and no baby chairs in the restaurant .. but the staff told me that they should get both installed soon  .. I'd go back  ",4,2016,04,13
60,In the heart of Barcelona!,"Pretty nice place to stay. If you are looking for some brand new or new accomodations, don´t go there. But, if it doesan´t matter, You can stay and enjoy. It is situated in Las Ramblas - nice place to stay.",3,2016,04,12
60,Very nice!,"Very nice hotel! Very good location, close to the beach and all kind of touristic places. The rooms are not very big, but good enough and beds are very good. Everything was perfect. We only missed the fresh juices and eggs.",4,2016,04,11
60,Not recommended,"Small room and very expensive . Room and the bed not comfortable. Tv very small, WiFi is slow
Breakfast good but not great,
When I come to barcelona again definitely I will not think about this hotel.",2,2016,04,11
60,Lively area,Very nice hotel in lively area. We had balcony room at front. Late night noise could be problem if you like going to bed early. We stayed out till the early hours along with very many others. Room made up every day. All clean and well maintained. Good central point to get anywhere,5,2016,04,09
60,"Location, location...","I would give this hotel a 3 star for the rooms, which were a little dull but clean.  Staff were very helpful though and the location is perfect.  On Ramblas, close to a wonderful square containing lovely restaurants and the meeting place for the Runner Bean walking tour (free), just donate what you think it is worth.  A lovely area, lots to see within easy walking distance.  Easy to get to on the airport bus, just a ten minute walk from the bus stop! Perfecto!  Will definitely use this hotel again when I return, which I will.",4,2016,04,09
60,Decent Hotel with a central location!,"The hotel is located centrally, right at La Ramblas! Good location for those looking to stay in the midst of the touristic area. 

Breakfast is decent and the hotel staff is friendly and polite.  However, I noticed that there are many such hotels in the area. ",3,2016,04,09
60,Ideal location,This hotel is ideally located if you want to be central in Barcelona. Everything is a short walk or a hop on a bus making ideal to get around. The only downside was that the hotel was dated and there was a lot of work being undertaken whilst we were there.,4,2016,04,08
60,Excellent break,"First time on a city break and found the experience overall excellent. 
Hotel clean, all staff very friendly and in the heart of Las Ramblas.
We requested a quiet room and got what we asked for with still a pleasant view on the top floor. 
Couldn't fault breakfast catering most tastes, room service every day and bar prices very reasonable for the location. 
We would go back again to this hotel.",5,2016,04,08
60,Good value for money,"i was in oriente atiram hotel with my husband end of march, the location in Rambela street is great and easy to go everywhere , takes only 5 minuetes by walk to catalunia squar.
the room was clean and the staff was very friendly .
i reserved twin room which was small and the wifi doesnt work very well .

Would recommend the City bus tour.
We will definitely go back for another visit as Barcelona is an amazing city. Would recommend this hotel for its central location .",4,2016,04,08
60,"Good location, mixed standard","Quiet and comfortable but small room (not facing the Ramblas). Excellent wifi. No shelves in bathroom!!
Breakfast staff seemed at times a bit uninterested in their job.
Breakfast quality didn´t match the price.
Very helpful reception staff.",3,2016,04,07
60,"Eimear - Kilkenny, Ireland","Brilliant location, right on the La Ramblas. The staff were very friendly and efficient. The rooms were very clean, with average furnishings. Some building / updating of some of the floors but the noise level was not disturbing and not being carried out on my floor. ",4,2016,04,06
60,Review,"Good location, easy to find and to get to other area we used the metro near by, friendly and helpful staff, the breakfast was average very basic, the room was very also basic but it was suffient enough for us as we were out sight seeing all day. It would of been nice to have at least had a kettle in the the room and as we were celebrating I thought we bay of got a free bottle of wine( we have at previous hotels) We did get some sweets on the day we were leaving which was a nice gesture.I think I would recommend this hotel because of location but if we hadn't of been out for most of the day I would of wanted some more comforts and it could do with up dating and they need to improve the wifi connection we could access any emails while we were there.",3,2016,04,05
60,Lovely stay in Barcelona,A lovely city break in a great hotel so central to everything you need to see.   The staff in the hotel were friendly and helpful with any queries we had.   The location of the hotel gave easy access to the port and in the evening lovely to walk up and down the Ramblas.,5,2016,04,05
60,Ideal location in Barcelona,Inexpensive but comfortable hotel in ideal location for exploring Barcelona. Only 25 mins from airport. 10 min walk from plaza Base where tourist buses taxis and metro and airport buses are coated. Beach front 20 minute walk in opposite direction. TAKE GOOD WALKING SHOES is best tip I can give,4,2016,04,05
60,Nice stay at Oriente Atiram Barcelona,"Nice hotel, close to everything. The staff was friendly and helpful and the Hotel was clean. Its a walk away from a lot of restaurants and Mercado St. Josep. Night life is right in front of the Hotel and is very vibrant. It feels safe to walk in La Rambla even late at night coming back from eating or from a show. It's the 2nd time I've stayed here. I will definitely recommend it to my family and friends.",5,2016,04,05
60,In town for El Clasico,"It was a great location to shop and feel the pulse of Las Ramblas. But, unless you're really tired from walking all day (like us in Gothic District); you're not getting much sleep due to nightlife. But, the major issue was the bed; very hard and pillows were awful. But, for the price it was a pretty good deal. The staff was very friendly and quick to attend to my needs. I knew going in that noise would be 24-7.",3,2016,04,05
60,average hotel,"we had some problems during our stay,like our room power shuting down and room that they gave us first was very very old and like no stars hotels!but the second one after the electricity problem wasnt bad such as the first one,atleast that wasnt such a 3star hotel that we expect.",3,2016,04,05
60,Terrible!,We stayed at the hotel in October 2015.The room was ok HOWEVER the smell coming from the bathroom was unbearable! We felt we are staying next to sewage! We complained the next morning to the concierge and she wasn't really surprised - they offered to move us to another room. Unfortunately the new room had the same smell and it looks like this is a real problem. When we complained again we were told that all rooms have similar smell and gave us a spray! Very bad experience!!!!!,1,2016,04,04
60,Conveniently located on the heart of las ramblas,"This is the fourth time we have stayed at this hotel in the last two years,  It is very conveniently located and is easy to get to by travelling from the airport on the aerobus with a short walk from placa cataluyna down las ramblas.

60,Unfriendly staff,The front desk staff was unwelcoming and not friendly at all.They seem bothered when I asked questions and even checking in and out if the hotel they had a bad attitude you don't want to see when you are on a vacation and paying to stay at thier hotel. Location is excellent and rooms ok except you hear your neighbors.,2,2016,04,01
60,Excellent Experience,"The hotel was great, lovely room, clean, bright and very comfortable, the staff were great, really helpful and friendly, best hotel we have experienced in long while, we do a lot of city breaks, so I think it was one of the best !",5,2016,03,31
60,City Break,"Hotel is in popular place, 20 minutes walk from airport bus drop off. Hotel staff very helpful, very clean, good choice of breakfast continental and hot cooked food. We had room on front of hotel overlooking Las Ramblas room had sound proof windows, which was a good job as you could not sleep with the windows open because of the noise out side. We went end of March which was a good time to go. Room was good size very clean. Only two down points were bed could have been better, old spring type of bed, and no Tea/Coffee making facilities. We Brits do like a cup of tea. Free wi-fi. We would stay again and would recommend.",4,2016,03,30
60,Best choice,"The hotel has a very centric position,close to the  port  and  Placa Reial where you can  eat very well and  price friendly.the room was very  clean and the  hotel  staff  very  helpful and client oriented.

I will come back for sure. ",4,2016,03,30
60,Barcelona stay,Close to all attractions by walking òr metro. Ideal for exploring this fantastic city. The furniture in the room this time was a bit 'tatty'. No tea/coffee making facilities in room this time. Staff were friendly and helpful. Will certainly stay here again on our next visit.,4,2016,03,29
60,Very nice,"The hotel has a great central location . Perfect to visit Barcelona . Very nice staff .
The building has a special charm and is very clean despite the age . Der einzige nachteil ist die Lautstärke von der Straße.
Die Metro befindet sich in direkter Nähe.",4,2016,03,29
60,Two satisfied customers,"Right in the middle of life. Made us feel alive. With easy access from the airport even for two oldies , Barcelona is a fascinating city to visit .  So much to see and do.  Transport links excellent.  Go.",4,2016,03,29
60,Served our purpose,"Hotel served our purpose. It is located on Las Ramblas, the busiest street in Barcelona. Probably would stay somewhere a little off the beaten path next time. Hotel was clean and staff courteous. The beds were hard and uncomfortable.",3,2016,03,29
60,oriente atiram,A quite nice hotel well situated right on the rambla.The beds were a bit hard.The breakfast was all right. A bit noicy from the street so pic a room high up.But overall a good place to stay when you visit Barcelona,4,2016,03,29
60,The great iriente atiram,Good hotel for the money. Breakfast was good and in the heart of downtown near everything. The bed was not comfortable but it was ok for 3 days but if longer stay then the bed would have killed our backs. But all in all a good stay,4,2016,03,29
60,Happy experience,The location was perfect. It was right on la ramblas however was very quiet at night. The staff was very helpful and the decor was lovely. For me the bed was a tad hard but nothing to complain about really.,5,2016,03,29
60,Fantastic location,"Fantastic location, close to the Boqueria Market, Beach, 1 min walk to the tube station, very safe and clean. The staff were great and friendly. 5 min walking to the Gothic Quarter and to the main shops. Good prices too. I will definitely would go back",5,2016,03,29
60,Great Location,Great location on La Rambla and good sound proofing from street noise. We could still hear some noise but not as much as expected. Little balconies are great with lovely views. Our rate included a free mini-bar. The mini bar contained soft drinks and water but no snacks or alcohol. Our room didn't have a full length mirror which I really missed but all the other rooms in our group did. There was building work going on which disturbed us a little. I was annoyed not so much at this noise but at the hotel for not informing us beforehand. When we arrived they informed us matter of factly and not apologetically. The reception staff were mixed with some really friendly and helpful and some rude and hostile. The rooms were really clean and the cleaning staff were very friendly when we met them during the day. I would stay here again particularly for its location. Oh and free wifi!,4,2016,03,29
60,Best place to stay,"What a location! A former convent where Hemingway once stayed (not while it was a convent, I am sure. Even Hemingway had limits), this charming hotel is the perfect base for exploring Barcelona, both the tourists' city and the city proper, with a Metro stop just at the top of the street. Easy walking distance to the city's famous St. Joseph's market, the waterfront, Barrio Gotico with its narrow winding streets. It's a three-star hotel whose charm lifts it up far beyond that rating.",5,2016,03,28
60,"Great hotel, fab location ","We had a great time here, reasonable priced for the hotel that it is. Hotel staff helpful, room clean, balcony very cute- we got soundproofing which worked really well. Only issue we had was the two single beds pushed together and they were a little uncomfortable to sit on - sleeping was fine. Also, no kettle! 

We'd definitely be back again but would be good to see the above resolved. ",5,2016,03,25
60,Great location!,"The hotel has a great location, and our rooms were big and clean, the only negative thing is the noise...We choosed the room facing the ramblas, and this is good to see all the rambla's live, but obviously there's a little bit of noise...",4,2016,03,25
60,Great place,This is our second time here and we are from the United States.  Clean with helpful staff.  Love the location and the breakfast room.  Internet work great.  Checkin went smoothly .  Great Barcelona experience.  ,5,2016,03,24
60,Good in general.,Need improvement so that the cost to stay in there would be worth it in the areas i mentioned beforehand. They should wash better the towels because my boyfriend suffered a little bit a sort of allergic in the skin and he believes that the reason is because you only do dry washing and that is not higienic at all.      ,3,2016,03,23
60,Average Hotel but Great City,Location great and room quiet even when next to Main Street. Rooms were basic with no frills. Plenty to eat nearby so no need to have food at the hotel. Barcelona a must to see with plenty to do for all. ,3,2016,03,23
60,hotel to try,good location only spoilt by not having tea making facilities in room and we werent allowed to take drinks to room and the cold drink machine in foyer wasnt working the room was comfy plenty of storage and the towels were changed daily,4,2016,03,23
60,Centrally located middle class hotel,"Location great, few steps form Liceu Metro Station. The room we had could need a brush up, but everything worked more or less as designed. Staff friendly and efficient. Rooms do not reflect the exterior/history of the building. Good value for Money.",3,2016,03,23
60,Fantastic Hotel!,"Beautiful hotel! Staff where friendly and helpful. Great location to get around Barcelona on the metro or by foot. Large rooms, clean and tidy, shower facilities again clean and tidy. No noise from the busy Ramblas street in the hotel rooms. 
Fantastic hotel, couldn't fault it!! Would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,03,22
60,Wonderful stay,"Just in the centre of Barcelona , easy access to all museums and monuments , a lot of good restaurants nearby , very friendly and helpful staff , very good breakfast , comfortable and clean room ,
perfect for short stay and sightseeing",5,2016,03,22
60,Charming stay in a great location!,I was my 1st time in Spain and Europe for that matter. The best part of this hotel is it's location right on the busy Rambla St. The Plaza Real and farmers market was very close. If you're on a tour of any kind or transfer please note: this street is NOT big-bus friendly. Knowing this ahead of time would have been extremely helpful as there are city ordinates that don't allow larger vehicles to do any type of loading/standing for any length of time. So if you're book through a tour or transferring to a cruise or something like us be prepared to take a taxi to an approved location or have GOOD shoes to walk to said locations...,4,2016,03,21
60,"Great Location, great service, great price","It was my first time in Barcelona and I would love to go back especially to this hotel. It has the best location (las ramblas), close to everything, the rooms are pretty big especially if you expect something smaller in Europw. Great service!!!",5,2016,03,21
60,Perfect location!,"I'll start with the positives because I would certainly stay here again the location was amazing right on La Ramblas. Large room, we booked a deluxe, spotlessly clean! Chambermaids lovely!! Everything you needed in the room & a nice small balcony to take in the atmosphere from the lively street below. Excellent value for money. Seating area in room or a chair would have been a bonus as plenty of space for one!!

That said I would request a room that isn't on the first floor by the breakfast room. Although soundproofing is reasonable on street side it was very noisy with guests going to breakfast and I think also with them setting breakfast in early hours of morning? Rumble of metro very clear as well in room which we found strange!! great places for a less expensive breakfast just 5 mins walk away! Beds ok a bit like a put you up and very well worn mattress they could do with updating as not the quality you would expect in a deluxe room..... my only other negative comment would be a very British one .... No tea or coffee making facilities in room & not available for room service! Had to scrounge 2 tiny plastic cups of tea from the breakfast room but we also got from MacDonalds just across the street. 

All said & done still a beautifully clean and well placed hotel!!

60,Nice location,"Good hotel. Nice room. Bad stuff, especially man at the reception 13.03.2016 3-4pm. Charged for 3 nights instead of 2, long money return. Was rude about parking, asked to remove car, but it was his fault we checked in more than 30 min. 30 min for 2 guests booking-it's impossible!",4,2016,03,20
60,Superb location,"The best thing about this hotel  is  the excellent location it has, not only for walking but for taking  the metro  as well.   It's in the middle of the Barrio Gótico but near the Barceloneta too.  The reception people is nice and helpful. Breakfast is not bad but it's  expensive: 12 euros.",4,2016,03,19
60,City break,"Had 4 nights in the Oriente Atiram this March. Hotel location was spot on, right in the centre of La Rambla.

60,visit barcelona,"we stayed at the hotel oriente atiram during our 4-day barcelona trip.
all of our rooms were faced to the rambla, which gave us a nice view over this avenue.
especially on weekends its very crowded, and so it´s not really silent. if you want to avoid the noise, take a room backwards. the hotel itself is centered in the rambla, very clean, staff very friendly and highly recommendable. ",4,2016,03,17
60,Great City Break,"The hotel was very central but we were not disturbed by any environmental noise at night.
We were able to access information from the Tourist Information office across the road.
We were able to walk to many fantastic places through very interesting neighbourhoods.
Barcelona is a fantastic city.",5,2016,03,15

60,Excellent hotel,"Enjoyed staying in this hotel. The position was very convinient in La Ramblas street, near piaca catalugna from where was very easy to take busses to airport or to visit the city. Also near pica real which was beautiful and with good restorants with best paella, tapas, sangria and creme catalan.",5,2016,03,15
60,Great Location,"Really enjoyed my stay here. Thee location was perfect, the room was modern and clean and tell staff were nice. Would really recommend to anyone looking to see the sights. I didn't try the breakfast as I had to be up too early. Will be back",4,2016,03,15
60,Good base.,"We travelled as a couple, celebrating my husband's birthday. This hotel was perfectly located for our two night break. Our room was clean and spacious and facing the side road so not overly noisy. The room was spacious as was the bathroom, with a shower over a bath and a bidet. Plenty of very hot water. Overall a very comfortable stay in the heart of all the action and all one could ask for from a short city break.",4,2016,03,15
60,Barcelona trip,"Great location on the Rambles , Just across the road from a lovely square with great restaurants . Very easy to find if using the Aero bus transport from the airport. Clean tidy rooms . Plenty of choice at breakfast . Second time we have stayed at this hotel ",5,2016,03,14
60,Hot and noisy,"Would never return here, the room was so hot, if you opened the window then all you can hear, all night is , shouting, cars , bottles being poured into the bottle , the lorries emptying the bottle banks and this was at the back. Asked why the air con blew out hot air the very unhelpful manageress said, ' we don't put the aircon on until june' I said that we booked because the website says a/c in all rooms and she shrugged her shoulders. The family next door shouted most of the time and when i asked if we could be moved up to the top floor the again unhelpful manageress said 'yes for 120 euros!. Noisy, hot, tired hotel with nice breakfast staff but a very unhelpful lady on the main reception.",2,2016,03,14
60,Great value for money hotel in the midst of the tourist area,"Great location on Las Ramblas between the Opera House and the Theatre and very near the central market of La Boqueria.  Many restaurants and bars on the doorstep.  We spent five nights here at the end of February. Clean rooms, helpful staff and a good buffet breakfast (Euros 12 per person). Ask for a room on the top floor at the back as Las Ramblas can be noisy at night.  Would definitely go back again.",5,2016,03,12
60,Stayed for a long weekend,"Fab location great staff but would of liked a bigger room , beautiful Hotel and in the best place possible . There is a lovely square nearly opposite the hotel full of nice restraints and everything is within walking distance . Great place to stay would definiatly go back .",5,2016,03,11

60,Very clean hotel in heart of the Ramblas!,"Stayed for 4 nights.  Would recommend to anyone.

60,A very good choice.,"This hotel is centrally placed near to places of interest, transport links and all the amenities for a city break and/or holiday.
The staff are very helpful, and they dealt with a couple of our requests promptly.
They even welcomed us with bottles of water and sweets in our room.
We think that we couldn't have made a better choice of hotel.",4,2016,03,08
60,Amazing hotel in the best location,"If returning to Barcelona, I would without a doubt return to this hotel. 

The location of the hotel could not be beaten, La Rambla is one of the most vibrant streets in Barcelona, filled with bars and restaurants, a local market, shops and theatres. The hotel is located only a 3 minute walk from a metro station so is accessible from all parts of the city. If arriving by air, I would definitely recommend saving money by taking the metro from the airport to the hotel, as this was very fast and much cheaper than a taxi. Around a 7 minute walk down La Rambla you will come to the marina, where there is located the best seafood restaurants and lovely bars. All of these are easily walkable from the hotel. If you walk off La Ramble along any of the hundreds of side-streets you will also find lovely bars and restaurants, which tend to be cheaper than those on the main street. Again, all of these are easily reachable from the hotel. 

The hotel itself is wonderful. The rooms are a nice size and were very clean, as was the bathroom. To say that the hotel is located on such a busy street it was very quiet. Free wifi and a free safe were also provided, so there was no additional cost other than the compulsory City Tax which must be paid in every hotel. This is only one or two euros per person per night. The reception area was lovely and the staff were very helpful. We ate at the hotel for breakfast on one morning. There was a decent amount of choice and the food was very nice, however, it was very expensive compared to other places we had visited. I would not recommend the breakfast and would instead advise you to eat breakfast in the bustling market which is only 2 minutes from the hotel. 

I thought that the hotel was excellent value for money and is in the perfect location for exploring the city.",5,2016,03,07
60,Oriente Atiram,"Good priced hotel for location. 
Not the ritz but decent for cost, location and breakfast. 
Springs in bed not the best. 
Breakfast temp not very hot, selection always the same, however pastries delicious. ",4,2016,03,07
60,hotel oriente efficiency,"We have been very happy to discover and stay at the Oriente hotel Barcelona.
Ideally situated o the Rambla, but very quiet with a room overlooking the patio. So close from the market Sant Josep, the rambla, the plaza Catalunya, the port, and even possible walking to Casa Pedrera and even Sagrada familia. very efficient and nice people at the reception, clean rooms, god breakfasts. We should recommend to our friends.",4,2016,03,06
60,lovely stay,"me and my wife stayed end of february .nice hotel very friendly and clean,we had a deluxe room overlooking la ramblas.there was some noise from outside at night but nothing to worry about.the breakfast was decent enough.we were on the third floor,the rooms were cleaned daily also towels changed too.i am definitely going back to this hotel it felt safe and cozy,the police station is next  door vurtually,...all in all great stuff",5,2016,03,03
60,Would definitely stay again. Great hotel !,"This hotel was an excellent choice ! Friendly, helpful staff and a modern, comfortable "" Ramblas""  room.  Even though the room is on a busy thoroughfare, we had no trouble sleeping. The noise was negligable and the blackout curtains ensured that the light didn't keep us awake. The breakfast was very good with something to suit everyone in a unique, historical dining room",5,2016,03,03
60,"Okay, except a slight lack of taste on decoration and music","The Oriente has a good location, a good service, nice rooms… But the decoration of the lobby is ""average"" and the music is to loud. It is a recurrent problem in Barcelona where pastries, tea-rooms, restaurants, hotels… all seem to consider themselves as night clubs!",4,2016,03,03
60,"Lovely hotel, seedy location!","Nice hotel..seedy location, very noisy ALL through the night. Excellent base for walking to marina, Gothic area and Placa Catalunya, just a shame about the prostitutes hanging around when it starts to get dark, plying their wares!",2,2016,03,03
60,Mostly great,"Very nice place. Big rooms. Central location. 

Matress was very low quality and hard. Other than that I was very impressed with my weekend stay and overall service for the hotel and stay.

Recommended for a quick in and out or where sleeping is second priority to the Barcelona experience. ",4,2016,02,29
60,"Good Place, in the very centre of the City, closed to everything You Need for a Short trip.","The room was quiet and it was not at the Rambla side. For breakfast I recommend the cafes outside. WiFi most of the time available and the metro ia very Close to the hotel. Reception very friendly and helpful. You can leave your baggage there, in case your flight is late in the evening. Also the ride to the airport takes only aprox 40 min. ",4,2016,02,23
60,Fantastic location,Had a paint job and a general spruce up since we stayed last year.  The bed actually had my initials painted on the headboard! The bathroom got a bit wet as the shower door didn't close snugly.  Breakfast is very good especially the delicious pastries.  Good price for such a great location. ,4,2016,02,22
60,4 Nights in Barcelona,"The hotel was in a great position, so easy to see all the sights from here by walking, using the Metro, taxis (rank on opposite side of the road) or using the local busses. It didn't take long to walk down to the beach area or up to the main square. There were plenty of restaurants nearby. The room was a good size, bathroom adequate with a good shower and there was always plenty of hot water. There was some street noise at night but this was to be expected when staying in a central area. We will be back!",5,2016,02,22
60,meh!,"typical hotel room, didn't spend much time in the room besides to sleep.  Noisy from the street below. Great location for getting around. Bed was not the best. Room smelled like men's cologne. Staff very helpful with suggesting where to eat and visit. ",3,2016,02,22
60,Great Location for a Reasonable Price,"I have just returned from 5 nights at the Oriente Atiram in the heart of Barcelona's Las Ramblas and enjoyed every minute. I met up there with my adult son and we had a basic twin room which was spotlessly clean but had no frills; it suited us perfectly but couples may like to consider a slightly higher spec. Our price which was excellent for the Location of the Hotel included Insurance & Breakfast, the latter being enjoyed in very clean & efficient Room with a Glass Pyramid Roof. this was possibly a little expensive at the advertised price however was good value as part of the deal I got by booking directly with through the Hotel's own website. I would thorough recommend The Oriente Atiram to anyone visiting Barcelona and doesn't want to break the bank.",4,2016,02,22
60,Noisy but everything on your doorstep,"Although this room was very noisy with night life, a police station next door and a metro line running under hotel it was still a beautiful hotel with prime location so if you don't mind not sleeping well this is a fantastic historic hotel. With everything at your doorstep. Including shops and entertainment, Walking distance to the gothic quarter and museums 
",4,2016,02,19
60,Great Hotel in a Great Location,This is an great hotel on Las Ramblas Street which is fun pedestrian street full of restaurants and shops.  It is central to many sites in Barcelona and close to the metro public transportation that is the best way to travel in the city.  No need for a car.  The hotel was clean and the staff friendly.  The breakfast was excellent.  My only complaint is regarding the bed - it was very hard and the pillows rather lumpy.,4,2016,02,18
60,Great Stay with kids 7 and 9 yrs!,"We had a great stay arriving at midnight the concierge checked us in quickly and we had a great stay, enjoyable breakfast and it is perfectly located on las Ramblas! We booked tickets for the open top bus and would go back! ",4,2016,02,17

60,"BARCELONA, SPAIN 101","The city of Barcelona captured our hearts. We had such a wonderful experience in this beautiful city. There is so much to do and see here. We want to come back.We stayed at the hotel Oriente Atiram after our cruise for a post cruise experience. It was the best choice we could have made as it was perfectly located for easy touring and I felt very very comfortable going around which is very important to me. Everything was within walking distance within a few blocks. On the avenue, Las Ramblas which is full of artists, vendors of souvenirs, quaint restaurants with tables and heaters outside, sangria stops, the opera house a few doors down (which is a must stop) and the famous flamenco dancers hall close the other way. We found a wonderful market that was so colorful with fish of every size, fruit, marzipan, pastries, salamis of every color, vegetables. Your senses just came alive! On the opposite side we found a wonderful square with the most  interesting lights and fountain in the middle and restaurants all around the square. The hop and go bus was just 2 blocks straight down from the hotel. This made seeing all of Barcelona a breeze. The hotel was very quiet, clean, with helpful staff. I really liked the marble hall ways and the tiny elevator and the ramps for those with mobile difficulties.The room we had was small and basic but very clean as is typical in Europe. We had comfortable sleep as we faced the police station which was quiet. That was also a positive influence as they were present so it added to feeling safe in the area. When we go back I definitely will stay at this hotel because it is the best way to see everything and be close to one's hotel so you can't get lost.  Just plain great location and great find.",5,2016,02,13
60,Great Location!,"We stayed only one night prior to a cruise, but we found the location of the Oriente Atiram to be wonderful.  It was an easy walk to the waterfront and to Plaza Catalonia.  The hotel is also only a couple of blocks from St. Joseph market (loved it!).

We had breakfast included with our stay, and we weren't disappointed.  It was a typical European breakfast, so Americans should be prepared for this. It's different from what we're used to.

We found the walls to be quite thin.  The group in the room next door carried on for hours.  Luckily, we were so worn out from traveling that it only bothered us for a bit.  This isn't the hotel's fault.  Travelers should be more aware of his/her surroundings.",4,2016,02,13
60,great hotel,nice and friendly staff clean rooms every day and arrange inbound towels replaced most adequate breakfast can add a little variety every day same prime location on the ramblas in mid day five minutes from catalunya return flight luggage storage to,5,2016,02,12

some things  to improve: 
* There are only spanish channels in the TV.
* Very small TV.
* Beds.......",4,2016,02,12
60,Great Location!,For our before cruise and after cruise stay in Barcelona this hotel was a great place as it is not far from the port and but being right on the Ramblas is right in the midst of things. It is an older style hotel but roomy and clean. The staff were very friendly and accommodating and there is a computer available for use in the lobby. The buffet breakfast was quite good with enough choices for anyone. On our last stay we had to leave too early so we were given a breakfast picnic which was very thoughtful.,4,2016,02,10
60,Just right choice,"Best value for money, just right choice for barcelona, close to metro, friendly staff, clean rooms, just right size; not too small not too big. Internet works well.easy access from airport by aerobus and then 10mins walk.",5,2016,02,10
60,Perfect place,"I liked the place specially the location and also the level of the rooms ... i didn't try the breakfast but it looks promising ... reception hospitality was very very good

Hotel located on the ramblas few steps from the Metro and 5 minutes walk from Placa Catalunya,so you ca easly get anywhere you need.
Breakfast is very good.you have all you need to start the day...
Service was good and welcom.
I strongly recomend.",4,2016,02,09
60,all round great hotel,can only reiterate the comments made by varon_r1 who was apparently staying at this Hotel at the same time as our foursome.     Even the weather was wonderful!  We booked for four nights and within that time we had clean sheets and our towels replaced daily.   Only grumble was that the shower could have been fully enclosed as it was very difficult to keep the floor dry - breakfast was a bit expensive so only had it once and tea/coffee facilities in our rooms would have been much appreciated.   Staff in Reception friendly and helpful.,5,2016,02,07
60,Perfect for a short trip in the city,"The hotel was brilliant and perfect for what we needed for a trip stay in Barcelona. We stayed for four nights which included breakfast. The location of the hotel was great, it's situated on the main road of La Rambla where all the main shops, restaurants and the metro are. The room was a good size with a nice bath/shower and the room was well equipped. The breakfast was a nice buffet style which included standard breakfast food like an English breakfast style,a selection of pastries and fruit, ham and cheeses etc. The staff were very helpful and friendly. We arrived to the hotel before we could check in and the hotel kept our luggage safe for us etc.

Advise not to go to the main tourist information center across the road from the hotel as we were sold some fake tickets for the Barcelona game at Camp Nou! (not a problem with the hotel)",4,2016,02,06
60,All round fantastic hotel,"Stayed here wednesday 3rd to friday 5th february 2016. excellent hotel, location, staff, amenities, facilities, room size and views. staff very helpful. beds are comfortable, and rooms clean. location is right in the centre of Ramblas, within short walking distance to shops, eateries, plaza catalunya, marina etc. metro stop just outside. rooms just needed a kettle and tea& coffee making facilities, but thats only a minor inconvenience. great connection to airport via aerobus or metro & renfe connection at passage de gracia. bars nearby. beach not too far away by foot. would absolutely recommend staying here. p.s thanks to the staff for printing our boarding passes off, and for the free lollys and marshmellows ;-)",5,2016,02,05
60,Great for us,"Perfect for a weekend. When we stayed we were pretty much put all the time. The location is excellent for tourists. Placa de cataluna is up the street for shopping. Barrio gothica is across which is good for bars and restaurants. The rooms are fine, nothing spectacular but have a tv, safe etc. The room service is Asian from the sushi bar next door. Rooms are cleaned around 3-4pm so if you want a siesta make sure you put a note on the door! They also give you a bottle of water on arrival. Nice touch. The wifi is also very acceptable. I was able to watch Netflix. Which saved me from dodgy Spanish soap operas 😝  Just be careful on the street outside, it's rife with pickpockets and such",4,2016,02,03
60,Very enjoyable stay,"Our stay in the Oriente Atiram was very lovely. The staff were very helpful and pleasant from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. The rooms and bathroom were very clean and laid out well. The cleaners were in every morning to change the beds and change the towels. Slept very well every night in the beds. The hotel is right on the main street La Ramabla. It was in the center of everything you could think of, restaurants, tourist attractions and pubs. The location was fantastic. Really enjoyed our stay",5,2016,02,03
60,very nice hotel!,"The staff was very friendly and willing to help anytime. Room was old but clean. The location was perfect, metro right next to the hotel and short walk distance to many interesting places! Did not use breakfast service, but overheard that it was good also.",4,2016,02,03
60,mini-break,"this was our first tip to Barcelona, and the central position of the hotel was its best asset. It was easy to access the tour buses, and walk to the Gothic area and sea front. Las Ramblas is a lively street at all times of day, but the hotel was quiet",3,2016,02,02
60,Nice hotel in a great location ,This hotel is very nice! The location is great right along a very nice street! There is much to see here. The Columbus tower is close by as is the harbor. There are great places to eat nearby! The weather is great! The city is beautiful and easy to get around.,5,2016,02,02
60,very good beautiful place and friendly staff,"iwas not disappointed when i stayed for the secound time in january
the staff are very helpful and friendly ,breakfast is great with lots to cjoose from and the building clean with beautiful surroundings
the only bad thing was a sewage smell that was quite bad in the morning after people using showers although i found the smell to be quite bad in the ramblas area  so probably bad piping in that area
would be back again though",4,2016,02,01
60,Ideally situated for short break in Barcelona,"Nice, clean Hotel that fits a 3 Star rating.  Excellent value for money! Stayed here as an adult family group of 4, in a family room.  This consisted of 2 large single beds ( pushed together) and a sofa bed. The single beds were comfortable enough, but the sofa bed was quite uncomfortable with a thin hard mattress. Pillows for all beds were hard and not very comfortable. Had to ask for extra pillows, just to make it ok.  The bathroom was clean and modern, with tiled walls and floor. Mini toiletries supplied. Shower not too bad, and towels changed daily.   Liked the wooden floors in bedroom, as you know it is clean, rather than some shabby carpet.  Lovely French window style doors leading on to a small ( very small) balcony.  This would have been great if we had been situated at front of hotel, as it would have overlooked the Ramblas Main Street.  Unfortunately, our view was that of offices directly opposite.  Still, this did not really affect our stay in this lovely City, as of course we were out and about a lot of the time.  There is a TV in room ( don't expect many English channels though).  
The location is perfectly situated, and both the metro stations and the open top tour buses are nearby.  Plenty of bars and restaurants on your door step. And lovely little souvenir shops etc. Do explore the side streets too! 
Be aware of pick pockets, as we were warned about.  But rest assured that the Police are certainly making there presence known, and they seemed to be everywhere along the Ramblas area.  We were very vigilant and protected our bags etc ( we also made use of safe in room!), and we did not have any problems",3,2016,01,30
60,Best for disabled,"This hotel had a roll in shower.  They made a special effort for us to be able to take advantage of the buffet breakfast.  They had to let us in an entrance that had no steps. They went out of their way to help us in every way.  This is within walking (or rolling) distance of numerous restraints, the major market, and the hop on bus, which was disabled accessible.",5,2016,01,28
60,Great experience,Great location. Helpful front desk staff. We were pleased to stay here both before and after our cruise on the Norwegian Epic. We would recommend this hotel to all. From this location you can get to all sorts of wonderful sights and restaurants on foot easily. ,4,2016,01,28
60,Looking forward to our return already!,"Everything about our stay was excellent and this hotel offers exceptional value for money when you consider its prime location.
Our only negatives were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. There was also only 1 English speaking TV channel but with so much on your doorstep you shouldn't be spending a lot of time in the room.",4,2016,01,26
60,"Good spot, can hear conversations in next room. (paper thin walls)","Ok for price. Good spot on Las Ramblas, near metro. I would if planning another trip choose to stay in an area a little off the tourist track. Walls thin. Can hear people in next rooms and very noisy from street. Bed very hard and uncomfortable. Friendly staff. Overall ok. ",3,2016,01,25
60,Great Location,"We have just got back from a 2 night stay in this hotel.  

The hotel is in a fantastic location and is very clean with very friendly staff.  

We would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again!!",4,2016,01,25
60,not bad,"i stayed at the faimily room with 2 single beds and 1 double bed.
the hotel is located at the Rambla street so it is so easy to access the Boqueria market and catalunya plaza.
but there were no refreigator and even if a safe and too noise from besides room.

",2,2016,01,22
60,Oriente barcelona,"Just got back from a vacation in barcelona. We took the delux room that is very well decorated, clean, have a small balcony of city view just on the main street the ramblas but also very quiet dou to the double glassing window.
The hotel is vary centerly located and the delux room is also included with a free minibar and coffee and tea kit. The  receptionists are very nice and helpfull especially daniel who was very warm and gaves us lots of tips.
The breakfast is ok. Fresh but not very varied. It serve the same eveyday.",5,2016,01,22
60,Weekend away. Perfect hotel,No complaints. Perfect location.  Very clean warm room. Friendly staff. Nice views of La Ramblas from balcony. Double glazed so noise not an issue. Will be returning next year. No complaints at all. Perfect! 👍,5,2016,01,21
60,Great location,"We picked this hotel for our five day trip to Barcelona. The location could not have been better. It takes about 10 min to walk from the Aeroport Bus stop to the hotel. Metro stop is about 3 min walk. There is a supermarket close by and you can buy fresh food at the market which is about 3 min walk up Las Ramblas. The room was a bit smaller than it shows in the pictures but it was very clean with plenty of storage. We had a free minibar. Breakfast offered wide variety of food and drink. I would recommend getting room with breakfast, definitely worth the extra. Both front of the house staff and breakfast staff were helpful and polite and the same goes for the housekeeping. Our room looked out onto Las Ramblas and the tiny balcony added to the 
atmosphere. We have enjoyed our stay and would certainly come back.",5,2016,01,19
60,average,"Nice location with much to see on walking distance. If you can stand the noise of the nightlife on the Ramblas it is OK. Very clean room, but the matress was worn out so I bruised my knees during sex ;-) . ",3,2016,01,19
60,Fantastic location and a lovely stay,"Staying with young baby, nothing was too much trouble. We were given a choice of rooms and opted for 3rd floor as it was quieter but still had street view. Id recommend a bike tour on your first day for excellent city insight. The bar next door did lovely tapas and sangria! ",4,2016,01,19
60,3.5 Stars!,"Overall, I would consider staying here again. Before I arrived, I read a few bad reviews, but the stay was pretty good. I booked a Deluxe Room several months in advance for 75 USD per night (without breakfast). 
Pros: The location is perfect for all sight seeing. There is all types of food available within a 3 minute walk, there are grocery stores within a 3 minute walk, and there is so much to do within a walking distance from the hotel. The view from the room is great (I was on the 4th floor).
Cons: I arrived on a Sunday at around 2 (14:00) and the line to check in was absolutely awful. I stood in line for over 40 minutes. Also, the room comes with a tea kettle, but as I was going to use it, I discovered it had some rust. It also seems that around 8/9 o'clock, the wifi is spotty. ",3,2016,01,17
60,Bad surprises,"I booked two rooms to stay in this hotel last december (2015).
I've never experienced before rooms with such a bad smell : It smelled from dampness and I had to open the windows of both rooms to get rid of it.
The price is pretty high, though, in one of the room the hair dryer didn't function, in another one it was a bulb that needed replacement...
Furthermore, it's a very strange to find out that there is no lamp on the table : thus it's impossible to read or write.
The room provided for my children was really small.
Mine had a quite uneven floor (up to quite a few centimeters) : this is quite unbelievable for such an hotel.
Not to say that the people in the hotel ignore you totally...
Frankly I'll never go there any more.",1,2016,01,16
60,First time in Barcelona,Had a fantastic time.  Hotel in a great location on Las Ramblas. A little noisy at night but not really a big issue. We stayed in a deluxe room - the bed was a little too firm for me but again not really a big issue.  We found the reception staff so helpful and polite at all times.  I would love to go back,4,2016,01,14
60,"Excellent, clean and central","This hotel is a lovely boutique hotel in las ramblas main street. Right in the midst of everything Shops, restaurants etc. The hotel is affordable, given its cleanliness and location. Fast food restaurants are right infront of the hotel (kfc and mcdonalds). Starbucks is a less than 5 minutes walk if you go outside the hotel and make a left. The triple room is big and is spotless. Housekeeping do their work well every day. Shopping for souvenirs outside of las ramblas is much cheaper though (because its obviously a touristic area). The rooms have small balconies which was very convenient as I'm a smoker (I didnt need to walk outside to smoke). The hotel is a 5 mins walk to the beach area near the mall Maremagnum (see picture attached). It was an overall lovely experience to stay there for a week. Will definitely go again if I'm in Barcelona. ",5,2016,01,14
60,Great Location,"Very good location on the Ramblas.  Walking distance to many attractions and restaurants.  Hotel very clean, staff helpful and friendly.  Rooms very adequate for a city break.  Shower room recently refurbished, good shower!!",4,2016,01,13
60,"Good location, not that much of a hotel","3 star hotel after all. Great location though, close to everything from transportation to restaurants to the famous food market. It is on La Rambla (best street in Barcelona) and very convincing to go anywhere else from there. ",3,2016,01,12
60,Good location,"The hotel is located Very Well tweet, many restaurants around. Metro is close, you can walk to the Cataluña plaza and barceloneta in few minutes. I like it Very much. Will stay there again. The staff is kindly, The Room is fine, a little Small for 4 people. ",4,2016,01,11
60,Convenient hotel along Les Ramblas street,"We like the location, many restaurants/bars nearby. The staffs are friendly and helpful. The room is clean, but we felt cold in the night. The cover might be thin. The internet is ok. We did not eat breakfast. 12 euro per person is kind expensive, easily to eat breakfast or buy foods outside.",4,2016,01,08
60,"Except location, there is no benefit. ",Even if 3 star hotel only deluxe room has mini bar refrigerator. I stayed at standard room it is ok without minibar. But when I asked to reception for hot water or elec kettle I couldnt get. Should go to All day dining and get. Some of basic service should be considered. And window view is too noisy. ,1,2016,01,08
60,Barcelona 6 nights,Nice central location. Hotel is bit tired and beds comfort is major negative point.supermarket is nearby. Staff was helpful and booked our trips for Zoo and Aquarium and touristic bus trip. Careful with taxi drivers as they may change you more.,3,2016,01,07
60,COUPLE TRAVELLING  TO BARCELONA FOR 5 NIGHTS INCUDING NEW YEARS EVE.,"Excellent value for a 3 star hotel superbly located in the heart of the Ramblas. Spotlessley clean throughout the whole hotel. We booked a room with a balcony overlooking the Ramblas and fully expected the noise late at night, not everyone would like this but did not bother us. Room was serviced every day., very clean. We would have liked  tea and coffe making facilities in the room but this was no big deal. We will definately stay here again upon our return to Barcelona.",5,2016,01,06
60,Wonderful stay,"Just perfect, wanted to change room on arrival , very easily done. A perfect balance of friendliness and efficiency. Breakfast very good with lots of choice. Japanese food for room service. The best location in the middle of everything. All the staff were great . Thanks for a lovely relaxing Christmas",5,2016,01,05
60,General review!,"The hotel has a long history, but IT need to bee smarten up, and the rooms to bee re-furnish!!!! It could be done for a small coast, and maybee it is a good idea to make a more quiet lounge in an other place!",4,2016,01,05
60,City break,Stayed here over the new year. Rooms are very clean and basic but what more do you want on a city break. Staff polite and very helpful. We took staff advice and went to the magic fountain to see the new year in they even gave us advice on the metro. We did not book breakfast so can't comment but there are so many places nearby on the Rambla.,3,2016,01,03
60,Stopover ,Not a good start - 2.00 pm and room not ready;  booked two rooms - same name - guess what they gave us level 2 and level 4 - couldn't manage to even get us on the same floor Then had to wait until after 4pm to get a rooms on the same floor When two rooms are booked in the same name why wouldn't the rooms be allocated adjoining - too much common sense  hmmm No where to put the soap in the shower Really!!! How does that get missed Now here's the best one only one thin pillow Asked for more but because they are fully booked looks like it's the thin pillow All this and I've been here only one hour Can't wait to get out ,1,2016,01,01
60,Our experience at Oriente Atiram,"The rooms were quite spacious with enough shelf space for luggage and other stuff and also centrally located near the metro station.  However the room lacked a few basic amenities such as a traveler adapter, a kettle on request etc. The breakfast spread was very monotonous with not one item changing any day. Some of the days the fruits were quite stale. 
 They hotel did not have any good guided tours or tie ups with other good restaurants.  However I found some of the staff quite friendly recommending us their favourite place, 
 however that was person dependent.  The hotel just focus more on customer service and be a bit more flexible. 

The hotel should focus a little more on customer service and flexibility.",3,2016,01,01
60,we can go back,"Everything was good! Except a bad odor in the bathroom.
The hotel is on the Rambla. The restaurant next door have a good breakfast.
December was a good time to go and see  the Christmas market.
We should go again.",5,2015,12,30
60,Fabulous hotel ,"Stayed 4nights over Christmas 
Hotel is great had a room overlooking la rambla with balcony 
Beds really comfortable and hotel staff excellent fantastic location 
Clean room and hardly any noise we didn't eat at hotel so much to see and lots of bars and restaurants close by ",5,2015,12,30
60,trip,"A great location. Staff are very friendly, above and beyond. The problem is chosen for us a room with double doors separating it from the next room. The noises coming from the other room had an Nsblim.csbiksno a room change, we had an alternative room.",4,2015,12,30
60,Exceeded expectations!,"First visit to Barcelona and having a hotel bang in the centre was just brilliant! Really sweet, friendly staff made our stay even better. Views from our balcony over the famous La Ramblas and a great breakfast nearby at the Cafe de l'Opera.",5,2015,12,29
60,VERY GOOD,"Good hotel, courteous staff, fine rooms, internet fine, the staff courteous and answer all the questions, a good breakfast all fresh
The hotel's location on the Ramblas street and it's a very big advantage",4,2015,12,23
60,Molly 21st birthday ole ole ole ole,"stayed at hotel with my family it was a 21st birday present for Molly and had 3 trouble rooms ,worth paying the extra for superior rambles view fantastic location staff great .natalie was great. Easy access to metro and everything in walking distance. Great time had by all.",4,2015,12,23
60,"""Brilliant'","Recently returned from a weekend City break with friends in Barcelona having stayed at the Oriente Hotel on Las Ramblas on a 'room only' basis.  The hotel is centrally located and ideal for exploring the city.  Check in at the hotel was quick and the staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay.  We read some of the other reviews prior to our visit but any concerns we had were unfounded.  

We had a room on the third floor at the rear of the property and had no issues with noise.  Yes you can hear the 'rumble' of the metro trains but this stops at midnight...in any event it's not excessive.  The rooms were very clean and tidy....The beds were okay, but then again we had been out all day and were shattered so no problems with nodding off. To be honest we couldn't fault the Hotel.

The City itself was magnificent...plenty of places to eat (and drink) and at reasonable prices considering where you are.  We bought a two day tourist bus pass which were readily available, doing the west side one day and the east side the following day.  Thoroughly enjoyed a visit to the Camp Nou and the Ice Bar down by the Beach.  So much to do and see with so little time to do it in....rather than go into detail about where to visit, explore it for yourself...it's all part of the fun. 

This was our first time in Barcelona, and it didn't disappoint, absolutely brilliant.  We are looking forward to returning again someday.",5,2015,12,22
60,Very good,"Very conveniently located and good price. The staff at the reception very friendly and helpful. The room clean, comfortable bed. I could not turn on the TV but there were better entertainments nearby.",4,2015,12,22
60,5 STARS !!!,"Great Location, (walking distance to everything) really nice staff, nice room and bathroom, really good breakfast, free WiFi, free candy at the lobby! Free water upon check in! My experience was just perfect! THANK YOU! GRACIAS!",5,2015,12,22
60,Oh the beds!,"Great location, lovely helpful staff, clean and spacious bedrooms. Down side, beds are truly awful and bit like metal put you ups and the bedroom was stifling all the time, as the centrally controlled heating means you can't turn it off. I kept leaving the windows opened but the cleaners kept closing them! The heat was unbearable. There is a thermostat that I turned down to 5 but heat still kept coming out. Would I stay again ? No, but only because of the heat and beds. ",2,2015,12,20
60,"Once upon a time, it was really good-these times are over","The only pleasant experience was the politeness of the ladies of the roomservice. 
I had asked for a quite room, not facing the street, we got one directly facing the Rambla.
In the room there was a nerving sound from pipes in the wall, day and night. Nine years ago we had got a nice room, a generous breakfast with the best coffee in Barcelona. Now we got a ... breakfast with coffee from a machine, for each cup one had to walk through the hall, where one coffee machine is standing. No pots for coffee or tea. Black Tea was not at all available towards the second half of breakfast time - when we entered the breakfast hall, the waiters first word was not good morning, but a harsh: ""room number ??"" - it was just disappointing and the only reason to stay was that we were too tired to look for another Hotel and went outside for breakfast the next two days. 
",2,2015,12,17
60,Amazing Staff,"Right on Las Ramblas, within a five to ten minute walk to Port Vell, where the shopping centre is.  The noise wasn't too bad considering the location either.  The hotel was clean, cosy and simple, which suited our needs.  The staff however, made this holiday!  They were so friendly; approachable and really knowledgeable about the city. They recommended us to go to Mount Tibbidabo, which was incredible - one of our best days on the holiday.  The breakfast was plentiful and varied.",4,2015,12,17
60,Amazing hotel ,"Thank you all @ Oriente AtiramWe stayed @ the Oriente Atiram on the 10th December for 3 nights,we were very impressed with the hotel very clean in all area,s comfortable room, very friendly staff, location very good & to top it all the weather was fab ",5,2015,12,14
60,Really good hotel for a short break,"Expected nothing from this hotel having read the mixed reviews. Chosen just for the location. Very pleasantly surprised. 
The hotel is in a perfect location for seeing the fantastic sights of Barcelona. The rooms are spacious with enormous bathrooms and very clean. The staff are all very friendly and helpful.
Asked for a quiet room and allocated one overlooking a side street on floor 3 with a balcony so we could look down to the Ramblas. Ok it wasn't very quiet but don't choose this location if you want peace and quiet. It is the centre of the city! We still managed to get a reasonable nights sleep.
Booked breakfast as on a previous visit it was difficult to find anywhere open before 10am. Not so now. The breakfast was fine with plenty of choice, hot and cold buffet. However if we went again would skip breakfast as lots of places open to get coffee and a light snack. We didn't really do justice to the hotel breakfast. Yes it's the same everyday but there is plenty of choice.
This hotel is really good value for money for a city break and I would definitely stay there again. I cannot understand why there are so many mixed reviews.
Just one comment please put facial tissues in the bathroom.",5,2015,12,13
60,Not bad,Not a great place at all; or anything to write home about. But was clean and price was right. The best thing about it was the location--right in the center of the Ramblas. To go exploring  around the area was perfect; and lots of places to eat within 1-3 minute walk. If you don't mind slightly below average room type; but want a good location then you will enjoy this stay.,3,2015,12,12
60,Overnight Pre-cruise,"Ideal Location, next to the Liceu and within easy walking distance of the Plaza de Colon and the Plaza de Calaluña .  Some noise late at night from next room's TV and from Metro which passes under Hotel but would not deter us from staying at this hotel again.",4,2015,12,09
60,"Clean comfortable hotel, beware the metro","Rooms are en-suite, reasonably sized, clean and the hotel itself is fairly cheap so no complaints there. No fridge (3* hotel), no toothpaste, no shaving facilities, but you get shampoo, body gel, soap and a hair dryer. Shower good. Breakfast nominal, but good quality, bread, chorizo (yum yum), ham, cheeses, bacon, eggs, jams, tasty juices and coffee. I found staff to be very helpful, with plenty of recommendations for things the locals do, go and see. Great location, bit of a walk from Placa de Catalunya, but on La Rambla with Liceu metro and Placa Reial only a few minutes walk away from the hotel. Fans were on as noted in other reviews, but you get used to them pretty quick, and the lifts didn't always line up with the floor level so you might have to step into them, even though there are disabled/luggage ramps around the hotel. The only real issues were beyond the hotel's control. The metro felt like it was going through the basement of the hotel. Liceu metro is on line 3, which is a shallow line, so the hotel literally rocked every few minutes like a minor earthquake was happening, but not a problem from 12-5am when the metro stops. The city is also quite noisy at all times of day, but hey it's Barcelona, what do you expect? All in all, OK, but can't really be improved upon by the hotel.",3,2015,12,09
60,this is a nice choice for a decent hotel on LaRambles,"Reviews before we got there had suggested it was ""tired elegance"", but it must have been renovated by the time we got there. Obviously built in two stages, beautiful marble floor and stairwell in part and carpet in the other part. Very clean and very pleasant staff. Wifi worked in the hallway, entrance to the room and the bathroom, but did not reach further.",4,2015,12,07
60,Excellent location,"The Hotel is very impressive externally. It is in a fabulous, central position on the Rambla. The staff were very helpful, and booked tickets for a Barcelona football game which was a great bonus for us.
The room was clean and adequate, but rather small, and lacked air con and tea and coffee making facilities - it had a modern shower room with daily change of towels.
We decided not to eat in the hotel's restaurant based on other reviews. There are plenty if eateries in close proximity, especially in the nearby square.
For the price of our holiday we were extremely pleased with the Hotel Oriente Atiram.",4,2015,12,06
60,Oriente Atrium City Break,"Just had three nights here, bit worried by some reviews but no need to be concerned.  The hotel is at the bottom third of the Ramblas about 15 min stroll from the buses at placa catalunya, so a great location in the midst of all the action.  We felt safe returning to the hotel around midnight.  We had the upgraded Ramblas Room, so had a window onto the action windows were good at soundproofing so slept fairly well.  Room adequate size, not 5 star but a very deserving 3 star.  Room reasonable repair, few loose hinges but nothing significant,  Beds are pushed together singles, decent showers and toiletries.  Only rate the mini bar as average as with the exception of one water all the drinks were full sugar, we asked for sugar free/lite but not available.  Reception staff efficient and pleasant, free lollies on reception.  Luggage room available.  Breakfast (ham, cheese, frankfurters, scrambled egg, beans, bread rolls, toast, fruit. cereal, coffee, juice) ideal if on a budget, next time would consider room only as many great value good cafes nearby.  Would have no hesitation recommending as a good budget choice.",4,2015,12,06
60,Loved the hotel,The hotel have a prime location on Las Ramblas. The staff is really friendly and nice.  The rooms and the beds are nice as well.  Room service is quick and the rooms are left clean. Didn't try the breakfast so no comment on this part.,4,2015,12,03
60,I liked a lot!,"Hotel is situated in a very good location. Middle of La Rambla and the Gotic Place and habour is close. Good foodplaces at La Rambla when you step out from the hotel door.

Room is big enough and the bathroom big. Only negative thing is that the walls of the room are not so thick. You can here when someone is at the shower at next room...
But it did not bather me while I was all day visiting the Sagrada Familia chirch and Gaudi park etc...
I will return this hotel when I travel next time to Barcelona.",4,2015,12,03
60,Dissapointing,"The hotel and room was very clean and the staff friendly. However, although I emailed prior to the trip to be allocated a quiet room because of us being senior citizens celebrating our 50th Wedding anniversary, it was very small and the bed very hard. My side was so close to the wall that there was no room for a bedside cabinet and I had to shuffle sideways along side the bed that I had to shuffle sideways alonside it when getting in and out - this was difficult as I am 76. I would have thought that the email would have alerted you to this sort of difficulty that you created.

The corridors were very noisy in the early hours, with people having prolonged loud conversations. There was no noise from outside thankfully. 

On the last morning before a 07.30 departure, there was insufficient water pressure to enable the shower to function properly, with just a trickle of water. We did not have time to complain, but did repot it to Reception as we left.

The breakfasts were good, but the information from Expedia led us to believe that you served other meals as well and that there was a bar within the hotel.

We were very impressed that the guy who checked us in noticed on my wife's passport that it was her birthday the following day and your manager was kind enough to leave a Happy Birthday note in the room.

The room cleaners were very good and each morning we returned from breakfast, the room had already been serviced.",3,2015,12,02
60,Super location!!,"We stayed 3 nights, couldn't be in a better location, close and walking distance everywhere!! Gonna book this hotel next time in Barca. Maybe a bit tiny room and slightly uncomfortable bed, but so worth it still!! Great wifi and nice staff in the reception!",5,2015,12,01
60,Awesome hotel!,"I would most definitely stay here again.  Great service, location and convenience.  Awesome shopping near by and great places to eat!  Also, close to the port so very easy to board the cruise lines.  Loved it!
",5,2015,12,01
60,We got stuck in the elevator for 15 minutes!,My fiancé and I stayed for 5 nights and was not pleased with customer service of hotel staff. Location was absolutely amazing. Being stuck in an elevator for 15 minutes was terribly scary. Breakfast mediocre. ,3,2015,12,01
60,"Great hotel, great location, bad beds","The oriente hotel, is cheap, ample with great staff, good bathrooms small but ok Tv etc.  The bad side is...... Sligthly noisy rooms but all of it is really great value for money, except for the beds very clean but old fashioned stone hard spring beds with pillows that are to small. I would still stay there again but I would make sure i didnt get a bed as old as thé hotel. PS HC Andersen slept there in 1852.......",4,2015,12,01
60,Very pleasant stay would visit again,"Excellent Hotel in a great location, about 250 yards from Liceu Metro station on Las Ramblas where you are surrounded by bars, restaurants, shows and lots more!

Rooms are very clean and spacious and very quiet as well.

Reception staff extremely helpful and speak English!

Didn't have the breakfast.

Would go back again!",5,2015,11,26
60,Weekend at Oriente Atiram,"Living in this hotel you are in the middle of everything! The staff was very helpful and nice, the room clean and spacious,and breakfast had quite a lot of possibilities of choice. The bed comfort was not so good, but isn't that a general problem in the south of Europe?",4,2015,11,26
60,Great Stay,Hotel was in a key location for all site seeing attractions.  Clean romantic and hotel lobby area. We felt safe and had no security issues. Recommended stay. They staff were very courteous were bilingual which made communication smooth. ,5,2015,11,25
60,Excellent location,"Really excellent location  5 blocks from main Plaza (Catalonia) on La Rambla, 5 blocks from port. May need aditional personel at front desk. Good measures of the room and bath. No complains at all. You get what you pay for.",4,2015,11,25
60,Good location but noisy on Friday and Saturday night,"The location is excellent for downtown Barcelona, close to the waterfront, near old town and attractions. But it is noisy with the street being where a lot of people partying all night. The furniture was old, the bath was clean but cracked. Breakfast was OK but not fantastic. The staff were ok but not really friendly.",3,2015,11,24
60,Very nice hotel,"It was a very nice hotel, close to all interesting things you would like to see. The staff were polite and helpful, the breakfast was good as well. Only bad thing was that the beds were to hard. Otherwise no problem at all, would absolutely stay there again.",4,2015,11,24
60,La Rambla hotel,"This hotel was great value for money, right in the heart  of La Rambla, close to La Bocheria, you can walk to a lot of the main tourist sights and catch the open top bus just down the road. The only thing we didn't like was the bed, really uncomfortable, you could feel the springs. Our tip would be: don't bother eating at the hotel, get out amongst the local eateries in the back alleys, where the locals eat. ",4,2015,11,16
60,Basic hotel in a great location,"Barcelona is a wonderful city. It was my second visit and I could go back a hundred times and not do everything. It's a city break and a beach holiday in one with architecture, history, scenery, art, culture and sport thrown in.

The Oriente Atiram is a decent if basic hotel. In fact, building suggests a rather more executive hotel experience than you actually get. The interior from the staircase upwards is really rather grand. However, the reception area and the rooms are pretty bog standard to be honest. You get a room to sleep in which is relatively clean and adequately furnished. There is no pool or gym and there is no outdoor space. It really is a case of, walk in the hotel entrance and up the stairs (or lift) to your room. Go to sleep. get up in the morning and go out for breakfast....unless you have ordered breakfast at the hotel, but why would you do that when going out is cheaper and more fun? The staff were friendly enough and, as with most people in Barcelona, were multi-lingual, putting us English only speakers to shame.

Let's face it, if you are staying in Barcelona you are not going to be spending an awful lot of time in your hotel room anyway. What makes the Oriente Atiram such a great find is the location for the price. Slap bang in the middle of La Rambla, one of the world's most famous avenues. You are right in the heart of it as soon as you step out of the door. You are a 2 minute walk from the underground station. You are a 5 minute walk to Port Vell (which is the modernised harbour with shops, cinema, aquarium etc, etc) and a 20 minute, very pleasant stroll to the beach. You are a 10 minute walk north to the main modern shopping area and you are right on the doorstep of the old town. It's a 10 minute walk to the Picasso Museum and 20 minutes walk to some of the amazing Gaudi buildings. 

You will need to get the underground to Camp Nou, Park Guell or Tibidabo but pretty much everything else you might want to see is within walking distance of this hotel. You really don't have to go more than a couple of steps out the door to find restaurants or cafes.

You might find it a little noisy at night if your room looks out on to La Rambla itself as fun and games can go on to the small hours but we did not find this much of an issue. 

I think if we were to go to Barcelona again, we might well spend a little more money to go for a slightly more upmarket hotel, but if you are on a budget this is really ideal.",4,2015,11,13
60,"Great time in Barcelona, extremely energetic city, full of marvellous and breathtaking places","Excellent location. Close to Liceu Metro. All most important attractions are within walking distance.
Some noise at night and in the morning due to garbage trucks. La Rambla is also noisy, but one should know, when choosing hotel at La Rambla, that it never sleeps :-)",4,2015,11,13
60,Weary traveler finds comfort.,"I noticed a very strong air fresher that was overpowering in the hallways and in my rooms.  I wasn't able to open the windows in the first room, but left them open all night in the second room on my return visit after the cruise.  The staff was very sweet and spoke fluent english.",4,2015,11,09
60,Barcelona at its best,"This hotel is great for touring set on Los ramblas and close to metro, and the gothic quarter, the staff are pleasant and helpful, I totally recommend this hotel for a stay in Barcelona not 5 star but very comfortable ",5,2015,11,09
60,"Unbeatable location on ""La Rambla""","Airport Bus t( E5.90) to Plaza Cataluña, walkable  with small suitcase, otherwise better take a Taxi from there (Around E 8.00.) Cheaper than 39.00 from Airport.
Cobble stone side walks, not recommendable to ""roll"" heavy suitcases!
",5,2015,11,09
60,Oriente Atiram Hotel on the Ramblas,"This 3 stars hotel is extremely well located on the busy Ramblas. During reservation I decided to upgrade the room to a deluxe room with a city view. The room turned-out to be clean yet dingy (paint is coming off the walls, the stratified floors worn out, cracked sink and very small 21"" TV). I was sorry to find out the comfort bed comes on wheels. If you are looking for a prime location at an average price this is it just remember this is a true 3 stars hotel so don't expect too much of the facilities or the breakfast buffet which is at best minimal. ",3,2015,11,09
60,Hotel Oriente,Fantastic location - right in the heart and hustle and bustle of Las Ramblas. Staff couldn't have been more friendly or helpful. We were room only but the Tapas bar next door to the hotel was great for breakfast. ,4,2015,11,08
60,Good hotel in a perfect location,"Perfect location, friendly staff, hotel good if you just need a place to sleep and shower without any luxurious extra treatments. Only criticism is the cleaning staff talking loud to each other early in the morning, so no chance of sleeping in. ",3,2015,11,06
60,Pleasantly surprised,Booked this hotel hoping it would be OK for the kids. What an excellent hotel. Great location and really clean hotel. Marble staircase in the lobby looked great. Lifts worked. Nice quiet hotel in a busy street with easy access to the shops and beach,5,2015,11,06
60,Met my needs...,"This hotel is basic and is located on the eternally-active La Ramblas Blvd.  As others stated, my room was a bit tired and and the bathroom was small.  However, it was clean, service was excellent, the hotel felt safe and the price was low for the area (evidently one of the priciest areas of town).  Everything worked and the property seemed to be in good repair.  Free Wi-Fi!

This was my first international solo adventure and, because of that, I'm glad I stayed here.  As I gain experience, I will venture away from the super-touristy areas such as this area of Ramblas and learn to navigate with multiple public transports.  This hotel was within walking distance or a zero-change metro ride to nearly every attraction and area on my list.  

Before I close, I must note how helpful the front desk staff was...especially the morning crew.  As mentioned, I'm pretty new to public transportation and this crew painstakingly helped me map out some routes which were confusing to me (a few times!).  They were absolutely invaluable!

You probably won't be happy here if you are looking for a luxury or upscale hotel, however if you are looking for a safe hotel that is clean, convenient, at a good price and with a staff who goes out of their way...you will enjoy your stay here.",4,2015,11,04
60,Not happy,"We booked this hotel because of location. I will not come back to stay or recommend to my friends. Air condition was not working and it was too hot and bad air circuration. Some staff were kind and helpful but one lady was not willing to help my request. Cleaner forgot to replace the new amenities. We called reception to her to bring up but she never came to our room. We had to go down to get them by ourselves.
Breakfast was poor. Egg was terrible tast and yoghurt were finished and waiting for delivery.
Not many staff were not acknowledge the guest in the corridor. ",2,2015,11,03
60,Average,"The best part about the hotel was its location.The reception staff need to be more customer friendly,the breakfast needs to be updated and the rooms look tired.I stayed in Madrid before coming to Barcelona and the hotel in Madrid was far superior to this one.",3,2015,11,03
60,Nice hotel but no so good amenities,The hotel overall is quite big and the location is very nice in Barcelona. However the room which I stayed in was small and the furniture was little bit old. The bed was not comfortable and the bathroom was quite small. The internet was not very fast. But overall it is okay for a short stay.,3,2015,11,01
60,Hotel Orient Aitrum,"This hotel has only one positive and that is its location, other than that it was very disappointing. We returned yesterday after a 4 night city break, we did a lot of research before we booked this hotel and we're confident it was a great hotel. The Hotel was extremely basic, the rooms were shabby and uncomfortable not what you need to return too after a busy day . The staff were most in helpful and at times even rude. Our pillows were no more than what you would put on a garden chair, we requested replacements or even another pillow to be told they had no spare pillows which I find hard to belive. Because of a phobia of lifts I request at the time of booking which I might add was in June! a low floor and on arrival they could only offer us the top floor and were not interested in changing it. Good start to the holiday I thought . There was no comfort or atmosphere at this hotel. The four days we were there it was extremely hot and so were the rooms, the air con was switched off and they refused to switch it back on because it was classed as ""Winter"" consequently we had to open the balcony doors to the noice,dust and smells of the bins on the rambles which meant we had very little sleep.
We were very disappointed and have never stayed at such a poor hotel. Breakfast was tolerable but again poor quality,again the staff were extremely miserable and very unhelpful . I would not recoment this hotel to anyone and would certainly not return.",2,2015,11,01
60,Gone downhill,"Booked this hotel again on the strength of a previous visit where I found it to be excellent.....however this time was a real disappointment. 
Booked a double room with a Ramblas view. The description of the room says it is air conditioned and soundproofed....clearly not the room I stayed in. The double room had 1 single beds pushed together, 1 of which was so hard that it caused a lack of sleep and a trapped nerve in my back. I raised concerns with staff on 2 occasions about this. The first time I was told it was difficult to find a deluxe room with a double bed and the 2nd time offered a downgraded room providing I cleared all the stuff out of the existing room before leaving for it all behind reception for the day. Didn't have time for this due to booking times at prepaid attractions 
 too  The air con is centrally controlled and someone amongst the staff had decided that putting the heating on was a better option despite it being in the low 20c outside...and soundproof? Not even close! All in all a very disappointing visit",2,2015,10,30
60,Great hotel for sightseeing in Barcelona,"The hotel is located on La Rambles, near a tube station. It's in a bustling part of the city with lots of places to eat including an amazing under covered market. 
The hotel is a lovely modernised old building. We had a large room, with adequate facilities. Breakfast was held in a beautiful room, with a good selection of food and drinks. It was very reasonably priced too. We would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,10,30
60,Comfortable hotel in excellent location.,We had a most pleasant stay in this comfortable hotel close to excellent transport links and in the heart of the tourist area. It was very easy to see the sights of Barcelona using this hotel as a base. It was very good to have so many sights on our doorstep too. ,4,2015,10,29
60,Do not stay here ,"Do not stay here. No A/C and unable to open windows due to security concerns. Room was very stuffy and hot as hell. Impossible to sleep. When I complained, I was given a room where I was able to open the window but all night street noise made it impossible to sleep. Did not have u.s. electrical current converters. My advice in Barcelona is to stay at a hotel away from Las rambles.",1,2015,10,29
60,Pleasant location and clean hotel,"Stayrd here 2 nights during a scientific conference elsewhere in the city. The rooms are clean and actually large, but very simple in their interior and amenities. Beds are a bit on the hard side but overall a very nice two night stay with good and attentive service.",4,2015,10,28
60,Right in the pickle !,Great hotel right in the hustle and bustle of La Ramba...couldn't ask for a better location...walking distance from the port and the gothic quarter...I found the service quite good so I'm glad I ignored the bad service reviews...we asked for extra pillows and they were delivered without hesitation...we also checked our bags in storage for free the day we were leaving as our flight was in the evening...the only downside is that the walls are thin so it is quite noisy at night and in the early morning...late sleepers may not like the noise...would most definitely stay here again...,4,2015,10,28
60,Barcelona,"Great location, The Rambla room was great view and very quiet when closing the window. Great water pressure at the shower The breakfast was fair.  I have problem with the phone and ask 3 time for fix it, the phone still broken",4,2015,10,26
60,great location,very helpful staff who sorted out our booking when we had to pull out from a July trip without any hassle despite us paying via a booking agent.  Great location on Las Ramblas which made it a bit noisy but you were in the centre of Barcelona!!,4,2015,10,26
60,Excellent,"Best loaction Ever, it was near to everything we want, food, shoping, traveling sites, casino.
the breakfast was OK but the same food every day, this is the worst thing i can tell about the hotel but still it was satisfied",4,2015,10,22
60,not much satisfied,"room services are very good. counter service is not much friendly, but i will recommend to my friends and family to this hotel if you have special rate for me next year for sure. i like the location the best.",3,2015,10,22
60,It was a good and a pleasant stay,My trip was for business to attend a conference in Fira de Barcelona. However due to proximity to ramblas street I chose to stay at Oriente Atiram. My stay at this hotel was good and pleasant. Rooms were spacious and a metro station was bang opposite this hotel. All kind of eating options are available.,4,2015,10,22
60,Great location in Las Ramblas,"This hotel is older and quite dated. It is smack dab in the middle of Las ramblas and close to the Liceu metro station. We had a room on the 2nd floor with the balcony overlooking las ramblas. Perfect for people watching and just soaking in the vibe. Our room was on the smaller size with 2 twin beds right next to each other to form a semi king bed. The beds are ok. The room needs a facelift. The floors had the edges and corners peeling off, the bathtub leaked. And you can hear and feel the metro trains rumbling underneath. On the plus side,  the wifi is decent, and the front desk staff are quite helpful when it comes to asking directions or recommendations. This would be an excellent hotel if they renovated it. The location is perfect. It just needs a few fixes  here and there. I would stay here again but I would try to get a higher floor next time. I'm never in the hotel anyway, I just go there to sleep and freshen up for the next days adventures.",3,2015,10,21
60,Their Front Desk Staff are Great,"I did not stay at this hotel, but I can tell you that their Front Desk clerks are great. I needed to call a toll-free number in the U.S, so while walking along La Rambla I stopped in here to try to use a house telephone. They didn't have one but they offered their desk phone so I could make my phone call. The front desk staff were friendly and so accomodating, I really appreciated their assistance.",4,2015,10,21
60,Lovely hotel in great location,"Stayed here in October 2015. The room was quiet and peaceful (4th floor facing into the quadrant). It was clean and comfortable and the reception staff were brilliant, they spoke excellent English and nothing was too much trouble. They kindly printed off some documents for me without a moments hesitation. 

The location is great for first time visitors like us, right in the middle of everything and easy to find if you get lost as it's just by the theatre. 

Only downside was no handsoap was in the room (we had some on the first day but it vanished. I assume the staff disposed of it and did not leave a fresh one) and no tea-making facility in the room.

Would stay here again.",4,2015,10,20
60,"Very basic, barely acceptable hotel","The location in las Ramblas seems to be the only good part of this hotel, being close to everything. Even though, this area doesn't feel that safe at night, some locals have recommended not to stay here but go further north. Even if you want to stay in this area, we walked by other places that looked better, around the Gothic quarter.
The rooms were clean, but very basic. No carpets, minimal furniture, basic blankets and pillows. Maybe ok for some backpackers or young  student travelers (even though the price is not cheap), but not a comfortable place for grown ups.",2,2015,10,19
60,Lovely hotel,"We both loved the hotel, staff were very friendly and the room was cleaned every day. Walking distance to plenty of place to eat and drink and underground stop just a short walk away. Seemed very popular and busy. ",5,2015,10,17
60,"ok, but that's it","This is a good hotel for first time visitors in Barcelona, located at La Ramblas. It was a lot of noice from the street, since our room were facing that direction. Next time in Barcelona, I will look for another hotel.",3,2015,10,15
60,Traditional Spanish Hotel.,"The Oriente Atiram hotel is ideally situated on The Ramblas and is therefore ideally placed for theatres,restaurants and bars. 
The only downside was that the rooms did not have tea/coffee making facilities.
The hotel is a traditional Spanish hotel so that you do not feel as though you could be in any city as you do in International group hotels.",4,2015,10,15
60,Very good value hotel,"Well situated on the Ramblas, quiet room overlooking the atrium. Friendly reception.
Downsides were no hot drinks facility in the room and no fresh coffee/tea/fruit juice at breakfast but good for the price.  We were able to check in around midday.",4,2015,10,11
60,Great location,"I can honestly say we throughly enjoyed our visit to Barcelona. Starting with the hotel which was fab the staff were very helpful from receptionists to cleaners. The room Was large, clean & comfortable...It overlooked La Ramblas, the view was fab. We had a fantastic break that didn't disappoint.",4,2015,10,10
60,Disgraceful,Been in our room 60 seconds and i cried. Need lights on all the time. No window that opens its so stuffy in room the air con well cant say what blows out more air. No plug sockets oh yes one behind headboard doesnt work. Woodchip walls...single beds ok if fell out with partner. Hole in bed sheet. No drinking facilites the cupboard that says mini bar when opened all we saw was a wall.  We had aid for breakfast had to argue over that as they said we had no breakfast. Prisoners have better rooms than this....wont be staying looking for accommadation as writing this before we walk out. The 1 marking is there as couldnt put 0,1,2015,10,09
60,Worst check in ever,"We arrived at the hotel around 1pm hoping we would be able to get into our room a bit early but we were informed by the surly receptionist that this would not be possible.  We paid 25 euros for an upgraded room with free mini bar and was told it would be ready at 2pm. Aware of the warnings of theives in Barcelona we didnt want to leave our luggage before getting our room so we waited in reception.  I asked if we would have a coffee as we had had nothing to eat or drink since 4pm.   The surly receptionist told me i would have to o next door as no drinks were served in the hotel  I was beginning to wonder what kind of place we had come to when i spotted a vending machine.  I asked if it was working and she said it was so why she had sent me next door to a cocktail bat I dont know.  The coffee wad awful, though.  A bit of cold liquid in the bottom of the cup.  I showed it to the receptionoist and she called someone to repair the machine.  So over onehour after out arrival i finally managed to get a drink.  We sat in reception with ourluggage watching other guests arriving and being given room keys straight away.  We finally got ours just before 3pm.  The room was ok but had a broken window and paint peeling in the bathroom.  It was noisy overlooking las ramblas.  The free minibar had a bottle opener but no bottles to open and no alcohol, just a few soft drinks and one packet of peanuts.  A bit cheeky really.  I have never come across a mini bar with no beer.  The bed was very hard and uncomfortable and not the double wehadbookedbut 2 singles pushed together.
We were booked room only and where not told whether we would be able to buy breakfast or even if the hotel seved it so we ate elsewhere.
I wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a friendly place to stay.  The staff we encountered did not seem happy in their work and did not make us feel welcome. They were unhelpful and unsmiling.",2,2015,10,09
60,Perfect location,Located on La Ramblas in the center of old town Barcelona.  Able to walk to everything.  Cafes right outside the front door.  I was a woman traveling alone and always felt at ease.  Staff was friendly and helpful with good Engilsh..,4,2015,10,08
60,Great hotel for city break,Brilliant hotel for city breaks. Great location. Rooms are good and beds are comfortable. Really friendly people that work within the hotel. Happy to be going back next year. Recommend if you planning a trip to Barcelona. ,5,2015,10,06
60,only thing this hotel has going for it is the location!,Uncomfortable and old!  Mattresses pillows barhroom and doors were in bad shape!  Dropping key off at front desk and retrieving it was very inconvenient since we always seemed to have to wait behind a line of people checking in and out.  Ridiculous!  Agents didnt seem to know how to multi task.  Also unfriendly and miserable looking.,2,2015,10,05
60,CITY BREAK,"situated in great place,staff friendly,clean room but rather basic,maybe tea making facility would inprove this.The breakfast is somewhat same every day,how about providing alternatives to scrambled egg every day ?
      
      ",4,2015,10,05
60,"Great Spot on La Rambla, but bring your ear plugs !","This hotel is smack bang in the middle of the action.  So, if you have a room facing the road, be prepared for the noise.  We were, following other reviews.  After our 3 night stay, we we're use to the room shaking when the train goes underneath.

Our room 111 was spacious  and clean with a modern bathroom.  Good water pressure in the shower and a good hairdryer.  Only negatives would be that the room was dark, very few lights, the ""double"" is two singles pushed together and it would be nice if the free minibar included a couple of beers.  

This hotel is close to the amazing food market and the gothic quarter and a 5 min walk from the port.  We were room only so ate breakfast outside in the many cafes right on the door step.  Or even better, an amazing fresh fruit pot from the market for €1.  

Be aware of the tourist trap that are the bars in the middle of La Rambla.  Great people watching but €30 for 2 beers and a sangria.  You are better off going to one of the small local bars and the staff are friendlier too.",3,2015,10,04
60,"Great location, poor service at check in","Brilliant location for first timers to the city. An old style hotel very well maintained and secure. However the check in service was very poor and disapointing. When I reported a problem with my room the person on reception became visibly angry with me! Not an ideal first impression for this above average prices hotel! 
      ",3,2015,10,02
60,Good hotel at La Rambla,"If you want to stay at a good hotel with a splendid location in Barcelona, this is the one! Spot on La Rambla, near to everything. The room was very well isolated from noice from the street (La Rambla), but we felt the Metro passing under the hotell in the morning and that was rather disturbing. We lived on the first floor, so perhaps this is not a problem on the higher levels.
      ",3,2015,10,01
60,Great location,"This is the third time we have stayed in this hotel in the last 18 months,  The location is ideal right in the centre of La Rambla,  Our room overlooked this famous street, but there was no disruptive noise during the night.  The hotel is clean and the renovations that have been taking place to the exterior of the building are now complete,  The breakfast is quite varied.  This hotel is in a perfect location and the staff are very friendly.  We will definitely be returning in the future.",4,2015,09,28
60,Hotel stay,Nice 3 star right in centre of Ramblas..noisy at night if you have an outside room but other than that good room no mod cons but does what it says clean bedding decent shower nice breakfast lovely staff very helpful ..great base for exploring this great city ..will come back..Gracias mi amigos!,4,2015,09,27
60,Enjoyed. Fabulous location,"Stayed pre-cruise on Sept 12. Other comments were talking about noise when overlooking La Rambla. We had a room there and heard nothing.  Everything worked well at the hotel and the breakfast was very good. Cosmetically it could use some paint touch ups but nothing serious. One could not ask for a better location so very much to see just out the door. Don't miss the market, just up the street.",3,2015,09,27
60,On The Doorstep of Las Ramblas,"Had an overnight stay at this hotel in a room at the front overlooking Las Ramblas. What a great location. The room was very well appointed and staff friendly. 
If you are looking for the ideal place to base yourself I would recommend this hotel. We didn't use the restaurant (if there was one) as we spent all our time discovering Barcelona.
(As we checked out I was slightly amused that we owed  1 euro 70 cents for tourist tax!!)  But well worth it.",4,2015,09,25
60,Pre-Cruise Visit to Barcelona,"Hotel was very convenient, clean, friendly and well maintained.  Built in 16th century (per desk staff), they have well appointed rooms in the heart of the Rambla's action center.  While hotel could have had a few more features like baggage carts and better cable TV, it was a very pleasant place to take in all Barcelona has to offer.

Our room overlooked the Rambla but there was not a problem with noise when we closed our balcony door at night.  Like most European hotels, the room was small my American standards but very clean and well maintained.  Hadn't expected such an old building to have such efficient plumbing and hot water.

Would recommend that you opt for the room of 3 or 4 since our Deluxe Room for 2 did not have much room to spare.  Priced affordably for it's location.",4,2015,09,24
60,Three night stay,"Enjoyed our stay in this hotel, fully aware that there might be noise from La Rambla, however we did not find this too disturbing at all. Clean comfortable hotel right in the centre of town, easy walking distance to the gothic town and the port
      ",4,2015,09,24
60,Great introduction to Barcelona,"We were very pleased with this hotel. Excellent central location for first time in Barcelona. 
The room was fine, good bathroom, comfy bed. A little balcony over Das Ramblas but very well sound insulated. 
I would advise skipping breakfast (disappointing) and heading to one of a myriad of nearby cafes instead- the one right next door is very pleasant with good coffee. ",4,2015,09,23
60,first time in Barcelona,"had a room (rooms are a little bit too small for a couple) at the back of the hotel, no pretty view but very quiet, stuff very friendly, the hotel's location at the ramblas is a perfect starting point to explore Barcelona. breakfast is pretty much ok, coffee at breakfast is terrible, sorry! But you'll get a good coffee only 10 metres next to the hotel ;o)
all in all it was a very pleasant stay",4,2015,09,23
60,Never again!,"I advise anyone to read through the whole review! Take note of the poor reviews! I definitely would not stay here again, I was very disappointed. Pictures on their own website are deceiving. The hotel is very shabby. 

DOUBLE beds were in fact TWO SINGLE beds pushed together, separate blankets and everything. As a couple, this was a major inconvenience for us. Where's the harm in actually having a double bed in a double room you're charging people for? I've never known a hotel do this. The rooms are very small, barely enough room for the 'double bed', 2 people & 2 suitcases. 

Room service. If you don't like sushi then there's a problem considering the menu consists of NOTHING but sushi. Luckily there's plenty of bars/cafes/restaurants around but we didn't always want to eat out. I also find it poor that there's no ironing facilities, you can't just nip down & borrow n iron. There is an ironing service but this comes at an extra cost. €22 for 1 shirt & 2 t-shirts. A dreadful smell often comes from the bathroom, sewage or bad drains. 

I upgraded to a deluxe. I'd like to have seen a standard to see if there's any real difference aside from the mini fridge contains 2 bottles of water & a few bottles of fizzy pop (refilled everyday should you use any) & tea/coffee facilities. Aside from this there was nothing deluxe about it and for an extra €25 per night I felt slightly robbed.

The reason this hotel is expensive initially is the location. It's in perfect place with easy access to everything. The staff themselves are lovely and nothing is too much of an ask. Aside from that I have nothing else positive to say. I certainly didn't get what I paid for & I advise anyone else to book elsewhere!

60,In the heart of Barcelona,"As a travel agent I am a little fussy...so was impressed by this hotel. Rooms were a good size, we overlooked La Ramblas...it was very noise of a night...all night. So ask for a room not overlooking this.",2,2015,09,22
60,"Great location, reasonable rates, helpful staff","A great find, location was perfect for us - in the middle of Las Rambla.   Plenty of restaurants outside the hotel, easy walking distance to the winding streets of the gothic quarter and a short distance from the metro and coach pick up points for the airport.    Room was clean and comfortable, we upgraded the room and had a lovely balcony.   ",4,2015,09,22
60,Well locatef hotel in Barcelona,"Very well located enabling tourist to reach all directions in Barcelona, to the sea, not far from the well known market, close to side streets with lovely shopping areas and easy access to famous sites.  Good shopping area for souveniers at reasonable prices.",4,2015,09,22
60,"Very central location, first class breakfast and clean.","As a first time visitor to Barcelona this hotel was a great place to explore from. The breakfast was first class, the rooms clean and the staff friendy.  A relaxing atmosphere.  Some noise from La Rambla but that would be hard to avoid given the location.  A good 3* hotel.  In an older building.",4,2015,09,21
60,Very good all rounder in the thick of it at Las Ramblas,"Although we had a bit of a trek to the hotel from the airport shuttle bus stop at Plaza de Catalunya, it was only a stone's throw away from the Liceu metro stop. The location was extremely convenient as it was yards away from souvenir shops, take aways, restaurants, bars, cafes, and little clothing shops. Just a short walk up the road towards the Plaza would bring you to the Hard Rock Cafe, and the other high street shops such as Desigual, Zara, Pull & Bear, TopShop, etc. Brilliantly located.

The hotel itself is slightly worn - I can't describe it as run down, but it is gently shabby. The rooms were clean, however the towels were a little threadbare in parts and the bathtub's enamel was worn away where countless feet or posteriors had rested! Some of the tiles were broken behind the bathroom door and some of the grout lines were missing or discoloured. But the power shower was great, lots of lovely hot water after a day tramping around the city, and fresh towels were provided every day. The beds were firm and although the pillows were strange - very long and flat - we were able to double them to get a bit more height under our heads. The air con struggled a bit at first but after a little while it was a very good ambient coolness so all in all it was very comfortable.  A telephone and TV were provided and there was ample storage space.

We got excellent wifi access from the room and we were also given 2 room keys for our convenience, which we didn't get in some hotels previously visited. The breakfast was 12 euros but as there were countless cafes on the doorstep, we just opted to have a coffee and doughnut at the McDonald's over the road for 2 euros and off we went to explore. 

I would mention that later on at night it does get a bit seedy, so perhaps if you are on your own, it would be better to stick to the main road.  The little streets off La Rambla tend to be lonely.  On La Rambla itself the pimps and their streetwalkers get a bit keen for business fairly early on (10 pm or so) so it was a bit off-putting to hear the ladies openly shouting what was on offer!

All in all, we were quite happy with everything and I wouldn't hesitate to book here again. Clean, large rooms, ample storage, comfortable beds, friendly staff and excellent location.",4,2015,09,20
60,Great location,"This hotel can't be faulted for its location. Halfway down La Rambla near the Liceu metro station, you can be in the great evening atmosphere immediately.
The room was very comfortable, clean and quiet ( we were at the back), but would have liked facilities for making tea and coffee - expect that in all hotel rooms these days. I believe the deluxe rooms have this but hopefully the rest will soon have this too. Breakfast was not included for us and we found it expensive for what we had.",5,2015,09,19
60,Barcelona short break,"Without a doubt the best thing about this hotel is the location. Situated on Le Rambla with everything within easy distance.  Turn right out of the hotel and after a short walk of 10-15 minutes you are at the Placa Catalunya. Very busy area with high end shops and all the bus stops  and cab ranks and the Hard Rock Cafe. (A visit to the El Corte Ingles restaurant on the 9th floor is well worth it  just for the view).  Turn right out of the hotel and after another short walk of 10-15 minutes you will be at the harbour with lovely buildings and nice places to eat and drink.  On the Rambla there is every possible eating place and bar that we could want.  The hotel is 3 star and some parts looked a bit tired but it was clean and the rooms were cleaned every day.   There were odd times when there was a slight smell in the bathroom. We originally booked a standard double but decided to upgrade to Ramblas room for 15 euros a day. As we didn't see a double standard I couldn't say if the room  was a lot better. An upgrade did give us a balcony overlooking the street but as the room was small it was nearly impossible to open the door to the balcony because of the bed being in the way. Also, despite having double glazed windows you can hear noises.  I found it was worse at about 3-4 o'clock in the morning when the clubs finished and people would sit on the Ramblas and being noisy. Also then you get the street cleaners and delivery vehicles. It affected me more than my husband, who is a heavier sleeper.  The room was dark, compared to the rest of the hotel which was bright. There are no tea/coffee facilities in the room but there is a vending machine in reception where I think you paid 2 or 3 euros for a drink.  There are coffee shops right outside the hotel.   The breakfast room was very bright and spacious and the area was kept clean and the tables cleared very quickly.  Breakfast offered a varied choice of foods and you could have as much as you wanted. The staff were friendly and helpful. There are the facilities to leave your cases while waiting to be picked up when you leave. The room was kept locked and only opened by the staff who put your cases in there and  retrieved your cases for which you had been given a receipt. So felt this was very secure.",4,2015,09,19
60,Lovely hotel in the heart of Barcelona on Les Rambles,"We stayed in this hotel for four nights during the last week in August 2015. We had a family room which was equipped with two single beds placed together as a double (which actually worked very well) and another single bed for our teenage son. Both the room and bathroom were well decorated and spacious.  We had one of the rooms with french doors that overlooked Les Rambles.  We were not disturbed by any noise during our stay at the hotel.
Barcelona is a beautiful city and I can recommend the following:
-The bus tour (two days) to get your bearings and to hop on hop off to visit local landmarks/attractions etc
-La Sagrada Familia which is stunning both inside and out
-Gaudi Park with stunning views across the city
-Port Vell/Barcelonata and the beaches
-The cable car 
-Montjuic - there's a lovely bar overlooking the city
-The aerobus is a great way of travelling from the airport to Placa de Catalunya and costs approx 6 euros per person each way.  The journey takes approx twenty minutes.
Opposite the hotel there is a square called Placa Reial which housed many bars and restaurants in traditional spanish buildings.  We loved it here and visited on each evening.  
We would definitely stay at this hotel again during our next stay in Barcelona.",5,2015,09,16
60,Great hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights prior to our cruise. Fantastic location on Las Ramblas. Hotel is clean and perfect for a short stay. No noise from the busy street which was a bonus. Would definitely stay here again as was right in the middle of loads of restaurants and bars.

60,Great location for a very good price,"Stayed for 3 nights and loved it. Right in the heart of las ramblas with many attractions within walking distance, lots of restuarants nearby and the place has a great atmosphere, room was cleaned daily and for the price was fantastic, reception staff are helpful, friendly and provided a map so we got to see everything we wanted. Had a great sleep although if people want quite rooms would probably recommend rooms at the back. We were at the front of the hotel so had a great view of las ramblas",4,2015,09,15
60,Great location,"We stayed here for one night prior to a Mediterranean cruise,  we choose this hotel because of the location.   And it was a great location!
Right in the middle of Las Ramblas 
So very convenient for shopping and dining.
The underground is right there so you can get anywhere 
Service was friendly,  we pre paid for the hotel.  But was charged another tax upon checkout, which is not their charge. But would have been nice if it was included in the price,  there was free wifi which was good
We had a family room, which was two single beds pushed together and a pull out couch,  beds were not overly comfortable.  But for one night was fine
Room was a good size, there was a small step out balcony
Hotel was a former convent.  So a different set up.  Which we found charming ",3,2015,09,10
60,Barcelona trip with friend,"Stuff is very friendly and helpfully.  Our room was clean, the bed was great- we slept very well with an open window (because we don`t like air condition). 
If we ever come back, we will take the same hotel.",5,2015,09,10

60,Expensive Convenience,"Great location, tight fitting rooms - twin beds pushed together with little space either side, no tea/coffee making facilities, bathroom accessories not replaced. Good WiFi connection. Tight fit for 2 suitcases. Expensive because of location.",3,2015,09,08

60,First time in Barcelona,"Had a wonderful time in Barcelona. Hotel is conveniently situated on las ramblas, steps away from the liceu metro stop, plaza Catalunya, sites such as Montjuic, Barceloneta Beach (which is in fact very nice contrary to some reviews out there), grocery store, and the great restaurants (be sure to look for the menu del dia for delicious deals!) and shops. The staff are absolutely wonderful. Extremely friendly, informed and always ready to help. ",5,2015,09,04
60,Good value for the money,"Good location- easily accessed by taxis and public transportation. We wish there had been a refrigerator in the room so we wouldn't have had to ask repeatedly for ice. The hotel is right along the Ramblas and short walk to the Boqueria

60,Beautiful hotle in  a perfect location at La Rambla,"The hotel's location comes on top of every reason why i would come back again.
it's central location at La Rambla make it perfect to reach most of the attraction either by walking or by taxi. the renovation make it look more trendy but still it has the vintage look and decor. the staff was amazing and very helpful. breakfast was rich and set up in a very fresh way in order to start the day energetic before hitting the streets in Barcelona!",5,2015,08,31
60,Great Location!,"Room was standard, clean, had a TV, and access to free wifi. It also had a free safe which you entered and created your own pass code, worked well and was perfect for our needs (passport, digital camera etc..)  Only down side to the room was the air conditioning didn't work properly. 

Also, I was on the trip with my mum and had booked a twin bed room. When we got to the hotel they said they did not have any more twin bed rooms available, only double beds, but after we kicked up a little bit of a fuss, one suddenly became available. 

The location was perfect! We walked to Sant Sebastia beach one day, took a train to Park Guell another day! Minutes from the food market and street performers. 
I would recommend this hotel.",4,2015,08,28
60,Excellent location,"The location of the hotel is great, there are good bars and restaurants in both directions off of the Ramblas, avoid eating on the Ramblas though,  you'll get ripped off. Hotel is nice but a little pricey, staff were helpful. It's worth paying the extra cash for a balcony overlooking the Rambles.

60,If there were worse than terrible u would choose it,First the room wasn't clean enough and we asked for room service they said they didn't have room service and we asked to go to a flamenco show they booked a ticket we went the place told us that it wasn't the right ticket and it wasn't today and the mini bar didn't have even a bottle of water and the ac was awful the room was as small as an ant we put the cleaning sign for two days and nobody came to clean our room the breakfast was bad and to get a bottle of water i had to go to a market there was no bar at night. I recommend not to even think about visiting this hotel this hotel should close for good.  ,1,2015,08,25
60,Very good!!!!,"Very nice hotel situated in perfect location nearby sea and city centre. We had no luck with view as we did not had the Rambla view. Showers in rooms should also be improved as these are partially open.

60,Comfortable stay in the heart of the city,Good location but be aware it can be noisy with it being in the heart of it all.  You soon get used to it.  Was fantastic that there was a fridge and tea/coffee making facilities in the room.  This made it a plus and I would certainly stay again.  Breakfast was good and the dining room was lovely.  Certainly stay again,4,2015,08,23
60,"Great location, good room","Wonderful location on La Ramblas makes this a great choice to stay if you want to be in the middle of everything. We had a street side room on the 4th floor, and the double doors did a great job of keeping out the noise when closed. When open, we had a front row seat to all of the people watching and activity on La Ramblas. The front desk staff was friendly, and housekeeping did a great job of cleaning the room. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,08,22
60,Great location,"Hotel Oriente has a perfect location--right on La Rambla and just a few steps from La Boqueria. It's easy to walk just about anywhere in Barcelona from the hotel, and the rooms are clean and new. WiFi worked very well and was reliable, and staff at the front desk were helpful and friendly. The rooms are quite small, however, and there's no refrigerator. There are also only two outlets available in the room. If you're looking for a hotel that has a little bit more to offer or has a unique design, you might want to look elsewhere. But those things being said, I'd definitely stay here again and would certainly recommend it.",4,2015,08,22
60,OK average experience,"The hotel was very well situated in the heart of Barcelona. The receptionists were not very warming. Unfortunately, there were renovations and the workers were speaking loudly to each other just by our window.",3,2015,08,20
60,A very good experience in the centre of Barcelona,"Staying in Oriente hotel was a surprisingly good experience! The position is excellent, in the right centre of Barcelona; the  staff is kind, although not everybody can speak English; rooms are clean and comfortable.

60,Perfect location!,"We have just returned from a 5 night stay at this hotel. We had a really good experience. We had a family room which easily fitted 4 single beds (no futon in  sight), pushed together in pairs. The was still plenty of space. The bathroom was spacious and clean. A few decorative issues but nothing that adversely affected our stay.
The staff were really helpful and friendly. We paid extra for breakfast which was lovely and offered a good choice of food. 
The location is perfect! You are right in the heart of it all! Easy to nip back and get out of the heat for a while, especially when with children. Very close to a Metro station.
It wasn't cheap but we all had a fantastic time!",4,2015,08,16

60,Our stay in Barcelona ,The hotel is in a very good location half way down las rambla. Staff are very pleasant and the hotel is extremely clean. There is a nice bar serving tapas linked to the hotel called Casa Lola. The restaurant serves breakfast however we only ate breakfast in the rambla or nearby square so cannot rate the restaurant. The only negative comment I can give is that the bed was EXTREMELY uncomfortable. Other than that it is  a highly recommended hotel. ,4,2015,08,14
60,Will go again,Location was ideal for site seeing and near plenty of restaurants. Staff pleasant. Room was good with comfortable beds and our son had a proper bed (which is rare). Breakfast adequate and clean and fresh.,5,2015,08,14
60,great location,"The hotel has a great location in midst of the la  rambla street , one can feel of the busy street through the day & night. The hotel staff Fernan, Fatou, Sandra were really good and cooperative for all queries and help us  in whatever we required and was solved the at the minute. Though situated on the busy street, we had a peaceful sleep as we were located on a higher floor. A suggestion would be an additional mini bar also in the standard basic room. The balcony is small but cute facing the la rambla street.",4,2015,08,11
60,Trip to Barcelona,"The was room without possibility to open window (scaffold outside) , partly loud ( no good Isolation of window). Air condition was OK. Very friendly personal. Think this was especially cause of building work. Central Location, closely to Metro.",3,2015,08,11
60,Small but clean and friendly,"My family of three stayed at the Oriente Atiram hotel from July 30-August 2, 2015 before leaving on a cruise.  The location of the Hotel can't be beat for first time travlers to Barcelona as it is right on Les Ramblas.  We thought that the size of our room was definetly too small to be a triple.  Basically, they added a roll away to a small double room. The beds actually touched.  The shower was also extremelly small.  We had a room that faced the side street and at night it was VERY NOISY due to the resturant/bar below.  They are currently renovating hopfully they are putting in sound proof windows.  Our room was very clean, and the staff at the hotel friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was typical for a Europen Hotel, don't expect American style eggs and bacon but be sure and try the pinwheel shaped pastries, they were delicious!  The coffee options were lacking for this American's taste but found that the Nestle machines were also used in the restuarants in Spain, so I just found a Starbucks.  Would definelty recommend for a short trip but don't think my family would be comfortable there for more than a few days unless we got a second room for our teenager.",4,2015,08,11
60,"Impolite people in reception, not clean rooms","We arrived today at 2:00pm , we have 2 double rooms, we have to wait extra hour to checkin as rooms were not ready, after we checked in we discovered that the rooms wall was not clean , lots of stains on the walls , we called the room cleaner who argued first that this because of people scratching the wall with their bags, my husband told her that you have to do maintenance and paint the wall, then she brought some cleaners and clean the wall and we were ok. Just after we discovered the air condition of one of the rooms is not working , we called and complained , after 2 hours they called again , I explained that one room is ok and the other had problems with air condition, but nothing happened and no one came to fix. Again we waited form someone to come , and no one came, so I called again after 4 hours from checking in and complaining 2 times ,the people in reception said they were busy , I started shouting, so the receptionist said he will come to c. 5 minutes and he knocked on the other room and found the guy in my room  without permission, I was shocked and told him the problem in the other room , how come you enter my from without my permission. He shouted on me saying that I called him to fix the aircondition, I told him I explained that I said the problem in the other room.",1,2015,08,10

The breakfast was satisfactory however, we encountered mould on a lot of slices of bread at breakfast one morning - that was quickly replaced.

60,Great budget hotel - unbeatable location!,"We stayed here for 3 nights a couple of weeks ago and have to say that the location is perfect, on La Rambla walking distance to the gothic area, Ravel and the marina. Literally a 1 minute walk to Placa Reial which is an absolute must visit for drinks and dinner. Also easy access to public transport to see other areas of the city too.

We paid a bit more (from memory only about £15 total) to have a Rambla view room. Definitely worth doing. The rooms are clean and comfortable and have everything that you'd expect of a 3* hotel - free wifi, in room safe, TV with basic channels and A/C. Reception staff were helpful and gave great advice on where to go to eat and just as important - where not to go!",4,2015,07,19
60,"Standard hotel, a bit disappointing","Positive: location on las ramblas, just 10 min walk from Catalunya Square (very convenient if you use the aerobus from the airport to go to the city centre)
Negative: rooms very small, not similar to the photos on the hotel website",3,2015,07,15
60,Nice hotel on a busy street,"Street facing rooms can be very noisy. Excellent spot on La Rambla with lots of restaurants. Within walking distance of old town cathedral and beaches.
A nearby metro station allows easy access to the whole town.
      ",4,2015,07,15
60,City break,"The hotel was in a central location near the harbour and tourist information at one end and the shops and main train station at the other. The hotel was clean and traditional on the outside and in, with modern bedrooms. There was WiFi available in the hotel and a TV in the room, however if you wanted to watch TV it was in Spanish only. Had a great 4 days with lots to see, still didn't get round it all. ",5,2015,07,15
60,Great location!,"Rooms were clean.  We stayed a week here.  Only critique is I wish they would change their breakfast menu a bit.  Front desk could be a little more friendly and work on being more helpful with guests.  They seemed a little ""short"".
      
      ",4,2015,07,13
60,Ventilation view and horrible beds!,"We got a room with one window to the ventilation area! So bad! Now light could come in and the aircondition couldn't be regulated so during day it was hot and way to cold during the night. We wouldn't choose this place again! 
      ",1,2015,07,13
60,Could not fault,"I recently returned from a 6 day holiday to Barcelona with my friend. The hotel was better than I expected, fantastic location, comfortable beds, friendly staff and always very clean. On the first day I had my bag stolen which had my phone and room key in which was a very stressful experience and would like to take the opportunity to warn people to keep there bags with them at all times (especially the park). After reporting my bag being stolen, I spoke to the hotel staff who were very sympathetic and sorted me out with a new key. They always went out of the way to ensure you were enjoying your stay and answered any queries. I could not have faulted this hotel and will definitely return in the near future.",5,2015,07,13
60,Perfect stay,We had 4 perfect nights at the hotel. The staff was friendly and the room was nice and clean. The location was perfect for us as we both wanted to go out at night and go to the beach during the day. I would definitely come back.,5,2015,07,13
60,Barcelona Beat,"One could not ask for a more conveniently located hotel at a better price and with better staff. I highly recommend this hotel if a traveler wants to be near the Ramblas and the Barrio Gótico. Cheers!

60,A comfortable Barcelona hotel.,"A great hotel right in the vibrancy of La Rambla, no security issues as the police base is next door. Be aware that the subway is under the street . Would definitely  stay here again.  Helpful counter staff, though a porter service could be useful for some guests.
      
      ",4,2015,07,13
60,Disappointing ,"We had booked our room 3 months before our intended stay through a 3rd party agent. We arrived in the late evening to check in to be told the hotel had a technical error and lost our booking for that evening but had our booking for the next evening. They offered alternate accommodation on the other side of town which we declined. We had booked the hotel for the location and didn't want to be packing suitcases and wasting our time when we could be seeing the sights! The hotel reception staff were rude, unhelpful and disrespectful. There was a young male on reception who tried to pick a fight with my husband! The hotel refused to refund our money so we had to stay at another hotel down the road at extra expense. When we discussed the issue with the 3rd party booking agent they told us the room was definitely booked and the hotel had told them that an air conditioning leak had meant our room wasn't available! All this also happened to the couple we were travelling with - their booking was lost as well. The hotel was obviously lying either to us or the 3rd party booking agent. I would avoid this hotel at all costs and book elsewhere!",1,2015,07,12
60,"Convenient location, excellent hotel","Just got back from Barcelona and was very impressed with Oriente Atiram hotel!
Great location, within walking distance of metro station, bus stops, hundreds of bars and restaurants, the beach, etc etc! 
Hotel was spotlessly clean, reception staff very friendly, always smiling and helpful. 
Room was also spotless, very nice decor and balcony nice and soundproof.
If you're looking for somewhere to stay for a weekend in Barcelona, I recommend Oriente Atiram. Great value for money and everything you want for a city break!",5,2015,07,08
60,Excellent hotel,"Recently stayed in this wonderful hotel located in Las ramblas. Very welcoming staff who were very accommodating to us particularly my husband who is not very mobile. Our room was located on the 1St floor,  next to the dining room which was very convenient. The room was basic but spotlessly clean and we felt very safe and secure. We were facing on to the main street. Noise was minimal and all three of us rested very well. With the windows closed and air conditioning on we had no hassle with the hustle and bustle on the main thoroughfare. Breakfast was lovely with lots of delicious breads, fruits and cereals. Will definitely return and would like to compliment the wonderful staff. Room 115 is in a wonderful location. Very accessible for anyone with special needs.  Well done to the management and staff.",4,2015,07,01
60,good location,The room was very basic but clean. We did book this as part of a city tour package and did not expect the best rooms for the price of the holiday but is was very basic. The only drinks falcities available were a coffee machine and bottle water dispenser in the foyay small bottle for €2 it was not chilled. Sorry if this sounds a small thing but it does make a difference if you want a drink first thing without going out or having breakfast in the hotel. Go to the spa shop just around the corner. Our room faced the side street and the side of the building is been renovated so there was scaffolding up. Not a big deal but it did make a difference to natural light. Overall the staff were very nice and helpful the hotel was clean if in need of a little updating. If you are looking for the perfect location a clean bed to sleep in and a good shower this could be the place for you.,3,2015,06,30
60,Nice and conveniant,"Fantastic staff at the counter.  Room was small (but I am sure it was big for Europe).  Big Bathroom.  It is a little dated, but the room was clean and bright.  Had a room looking over Las Ramblas and was not noisey at all with window closed.  Close to eveything!
Breakfast buffet is overpriced so go outside and find one of the hundreds of cafes to get something to eat.",4,2015,06,30
60,"Hotel Oriente Atriem La Ramblas, Barcelona","A friendly place to stay, sadly our room faced a side street which was been renovated and was covered with scaffolding.
Apart from that, the room was air conditioned, clean and very roomy.
Friendly staff.

60,Great Location!,"The hotel was perfect for us.  We wanted to be in the center of the action, and you can't ask for a better location.  Although the hotel is over 150 years old, our rooms were spacious (we had two triples), with large bathrooms.  The hotel is right on La Rambla, so if noise at night bothers you, you may want to stay somewhere not right on La Rambla.  The staff was great, the place was clean, and again for us, the location could not be beat.   If you like hotels with personality, where you don't feel like you are staying in a chain hotel where you could be anywhere in the world, I would highly recommend this hotel.  Note for Americans that are used to using washcloths, you should probably pack a couple of washcloths if you want them. ",5,2015,06,30
60,Perfect Choice of Hotel,"The Oriente Atiram Hotel was the perfect choice for us. This hotel is directly on La Rambla, only 30 minutes from the airport, and with a metro station (Liceu) on the doorstep, an ideal base for our 4 night stay. I had read some poor reports about this hotel in the weeks leading up to our trip but we could find nothing at all to complain about. The room was perfect, looking out onto La Rambla and just across the road from Placa Real (where I had stayed 12 years ago and was very noisy) and of our 4 nights stay at Oriente Atiram we slept very well- double glazing kept the noise of the partying crowds out! The room was very clean and was cleaned and tidied daily. The shower was fab and we really needed that after our full days of sightseeing across the length and breadth of the city.  I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others.",5,2015,06,30
60,Great location but noise ruined it.,"The noise from the street  was loud with bottles and garbage bin lids slamming all night till the sun came up! I'm not kidding either. Beds were thin and hard need to change out for new. The Floor was tiled, but was dirty, your feet got dirty after walking around room. Other than that it has a great location. I will not stay here again.",3,2015,06,30
60,Central location and thats about it,"Firstly, the road is so narrow that a large airport to hotel shuttle cannot park during busy hours. Due to this reason we were dropped off a kilometer away and had to pull along our bags looking for the hotel (after a 14 hour flight). Rooms are so small that there is barely space to place bags. We had specifically requested for a 4 occupancy and got the smallest room in our group. Since we were traveling with teenagers, it was very cramped. There are no complaints what so ever on the location. It is in the heart of Ramblas, close to the shops, restaurants, bars etc. Though noise level at night can cause some nuisance here.",3,2015,06,30
60,"Very good location, friendly staff","Nice peaceful hotel at a very good location. Neat & clean surroundings. I liked the breakfast area and service very much. just missed kettle in the room. Rest everything was perfect. Thanks a lot for everything.

60,Perfect Hotel,Stayed at Oriente for 5 nights; it was amazing & given the price it was perfect. Pristine hotel and room got cleaned every morning too! The staff were accomodating as well and very helpful with all enquiries. The location is ideal too! Right in the centre of La Ramblas so everything was of walking distance. Will definitely be staying here again when I'm in Barcelona! ,5,2015,06,29
60,Very good service,"The hotel had an electric problem when we got there for my checkin. They couldn't give us a room because of that, so I can't really rate this particular hotel. 

BUT ... I can say the service was really good since they took care of us by reserving a room in another hotel (from the same owner i guess). They call the taxi and paid for it, when we got to the other hotel(Atiram Oriente) everything was ready and we got our room even if it was before noon. 

We first did complained a bit as anyone would. But the lady at the frontdesk was so comprehensive, kind and polite, we just accept being transfered. ",4,2015,06,29
60,Review,"Good location and helpful staff! Unfortunately To noisy from Ramblan, if room located at that side! Great cleaning and kind housemaid! No fullsize mirror, thats a big deawback, that could be easily fixed",3,2015,06,25
60,Barcelona weekend excellent,"Oriente a nice hotel, with everything you need for a long weekend, right on Las Ramblas and easy journey to Port Olympic and the beaches. We had a large room with 2 double beds, the lighting in the room was very poor, but the air conditioning was Excellent. ",4,2015,06,25
60,Good Hotel,"We made a reservation for 3 nights street view room, The hotel was nice very clean, the staff is very helpful.
It is a very large hotel and the only had one elevator working at the time so it was kinda boring that we had to wait sometime for the elevator.
Also the street view room was very noisy and they didn't have king size bed they just place 2 normal beds beside each other that was the worst part about the hotel the beds kept moving apart it was annoying.
The breakfast was AMAZING ! the best thing in the hotel is the breakfast ! 
The location was good as it was 5 minutes walking from Catalnya square (which is the heart of the city with a lot of malls, shops and tour buses) but the Ramblas street was kinda disturbing , it smells weird and it is very crowded that you wont enjoy the walk and at night its terrible ! I would recommend staying in another areas of Barcelona.
Just to be fair the hotel is very nice except the king size bed and elevator part, I would not recommend to take the street view room, you must take the breakfast! and the staff are really nice !",3,2015,06,25
60,Holiday,"Disappointed, nothing like pictures of room which encouraged me to book this hotel. Single beds pushed together, could feel the springs which gave me a bad back. Room didn't have wardrobe just a bar across a corner, no chair when we first arrived. Bathroom, shower head had to be faced towards the wall otherwise the bathroom floor got soaked, this I found out on first morning when I slipped on floor and hurt my hip. Reception staff were less than friendly,gave us no information, and seemed a little exasperated when I didn't understand them straight away. The people who cleaned the rooms were friendlier. Barcelona on the other hand was amazing.",1,2015,06,24
60,Great location,"We stayed  here for 7 nights. The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was very pleasant and extremely clean.  This hotel is in a great location and near to some nice bars and lovely restaurants, one in particular which was about five minutes away and was called ""Los Caracoles"" where the food is excellent, especially the steaks.  We thoroughly recommend this hotel and we hope to stay there again in the future.",5,2015,06,23

60,Tourists Trap,"under the guise of a great location, the hotel offers very bad services to an exaggerated price. To avoid.
The chek in lasted more than 30 minuts.
Our room was dirty and noisy. Further to the above it was for 4 guests with only 3 electrical outlets. From the bathroom came a strong smell of sewage and the door was broken and impossible to lock.
Breakfast generally acceptable, just avoid the white bread that smelled of old and freezer.
The position is absolutely fantastic, but it should not become an excuse to beat the tourist with exaggerated prices and poor services.",1,2015,06,22
60,Central hotel good location,"Loved our stay here as we were right in the middle of the Ramblas, the rooms were clean and comfortable and for a central location very quite we heard nothing from the Ramblas.

We had a room at the back so we did not hear the street noise but the walls are a little thin so it was a little noisy but overall a great stay ",4,2015,06,20
60,Really sad,"The first few days were ok. The web site claims a free breakfast, not so. Charged 12 euros for a terrible selection. Things were ok until the last night. Apparently the owner decided to have a concert on the roof. No notice of this. We were kept awake by this until 12 midnight. Again, no notice. Asked at the front desk to comp this night since sleep was impossible. They either didn't care or were unable to. Rude. Would never return or recommend.",1,2015,06,19

Hotel itself very clean and room was tended to every day and provided with fresh towels and bedding, pretty basic room but modern bathroom, only negative thing have about the room was that the walls are very thin and we could hear a pin drop, often woken by neighbours flushing chain and running taps. But overall lovely staff, lovely hotel and most of all perfect location!! Would definately return to the oriente, Thank you for a lovely stay!",5,2015,06,17

We walked up the street to the Oriente and found a pllace that was far nicer, with a better breakfast, cleaner, and a very helpful staff.  It saved our trip.  A big thank you to the Oriente Atiram.",4,2015,06,12

You can basically walk to most of the sights: from the beach at La Barceloneta to the Gaudi houses on Passeig de Gracia. The rooms were clean though mine could have done with a fresh coat of paint and new curtains. The breakfast room is lovely and bright. The buffet is spartan but generally fresh except for one morning when the bread was definitely reheated from the previous day. The staff was mostly friendly and I really appreciated the little greeting (Hola!) left on the bathroom mirror by housekeeping. The free WiFi service on offer was excellent. I do not recommend this hotel for business trips as it’s way too noisy. My room was on the first floor overlooking La Rambla and it was impossible to sleep without ear plugs.",3,2015,06,11
60,Great time in Barcelona,"The location was perfect. Walking distance to the airport shuttle (Placa Cateluyna) and all of the historic sites.

60,"Good, inexpensive choice on Las Ramblas","Stayed one night before a cruise.  The first floor family room we stayed in was spacious, clean and well-kept although basically furnished. Most importantly, it was a triple room, which is rare in the area.  The hotel is undergoing exterior renovation (scaffolding and netting outside the window), but there was no work going on on the weekend we were there.  There was a big soccer game featuring FC Barcelona that night, so there was plenty of street noise prior to the match, but not too much to keep us awake during or after the game.  Great location in the middle of the action on Las Ramblas, tons of shopping, restaurants, etc. nearby.  The staff did not go out of their way to help but were pleasant enough, and we have no complaints.  Barcelona is a great walking city, and this hotel is well-located with regard to the major attractions. There are nicer (and much more expensive) hotels in Barcelona, but my travel philosophy is to spend money while I'm awake, not while I'm asleep, so Oriente Atiram served my needs well.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.",4,2015,06,09

Yes it's noisy, but again don't come to this part of Barcelona for a quiet holiday.
Barcelona is fantastic and this hotel is great.
If you want quiet go elsewhere or pay more money.
The breakfast is not worth the money, so go outside on The Ramblas and eat.

Eventually checked in - Room dark, onto side alley and windows covered in netting/scaffolding.  Time to complain! Initial phone call to reception - no other rooms available- appeared in person in reception and after a bit of a drama another room was found.
New room small but very clean (as ever brilliant cleaning staff), noise of Ramblas/metro doesn't bother us.  Location remains great.
More reception staff needed and HONESTY about refurbishment works- did you think we would not notice the scaffolding??",4,2015,06,08
60,Nice overnight ,We spent the night here before going on a cruise out of Barcelona.  The hotel was clean.  The room was a nice size on an upper floor facing Las Ramblas.

60,Bed and Breakfast on Las Ramblas,"This is a popular hotel located on the tree-lined walking mall (Las Ramblas) that goes from the bay up about a mile to the Plaza Catalunya and is the center of activity day and night in Barcelona. It is on the edge of the Gothic Quarter that was the original Roman city and now is a fascinating and historic place to visit. The Oriente is an classic old hotel close to the bay  that has been home to generations of travelers. As such, the older section of the hotel is a bit dated but has been renovated; the new section, more fully renovated, is somewhat brighter. However, it is the location that makes this a good stop and, even though the hotel is on Las Ramblas, the rooms are very quiet. Try to get a room off the main street though, just to avoid the occasional loud celebration out front. The staff is quite good, knowledgeable, very helpful. We have been there four times over the past few years and there never was a problem with reservations or service. There is a very good breakfast buffet in the sunlit dining room; however, you can eat less expensively in one of the many small restaurants and coffee shops immediately outside the front door of the hotel. So, excellent location, helpful staff, quiet rooms (get a room off the main street), and the old city is about one hundred feet out the front door across Las Ramblas.",4,2015,05,31

The room we were reassigned to was spacious bright and very clean, this room with a small balcony overlooked the Rambla which allowed us to savour the unique ambience and atmosphere of a bustling Barcelona. 

We will return to Hotel Oriente on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2015,05,27
60,STAY AWAY!,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 7 nights at the same time as Su C, what Su failed to point out was that this Hotel is situated above the metro lines and the vibration especially at night really was enough to keep you awake, I also agree with all of the remarks made by Su C and would never return.
I would like to point out that the staff did a very good job under these poor conditions.",1,2015,05,27
60,Not really good one...,"The only good thing was the location , tiny room , not really clean and smelly . The bed was totally uncomfortable  and the service was ok. I would not suggest it to anyone. Moreover it was noisy and too expensive.

60,Best than what it looks in the photo at internet,"My family and me took a cruise to the Mediterranium. Our final  stop was on May 19,2015 in Barcelona, Spain in the Oriente Atiram Hotel right in front of Las Ramblas

This is people who knows how to treat their
Clientele. Since the very beginning Ana at the front desk took charge of every detail. Our check in was supposed to be at 3;00 pm we arrived at 12:30 and inmediatly our room was ready. They gave us room 331 which was very comftable , clean and with a king bed, the bathroom also very clean
The location  is great you have everything on hand, taxi, restaurants places to visit the Cathedral was very near the small shops to buy subveniers and the great Catalunya people makes you feel like home
The chef , Juan, treated us like royalty  very professional man and the buffet was extraordinary. The place very clean and a beautiful crystal clear pyramid covers the ceiling of the breakfast area.
We solicited the WiFi and received it inmediatly. Ana and sandra helped us with the airline checkin documents and made us feel secure and like home. Thank you Anita, Sandra and Juan for all your love and help. 

The area is very safe, I read that Las Ramblas was very unsafe area and had the opportunity to talk with 4 good policemen of the Barcelona Urban Police and they have good control of the area and lots of policemen in the perimeters which makes the area safer . 
. Definitely will come again to this hotel and will tell my friends to visit this hotel and their  great people . They are real professionals in this business. 
Thanks for the beautiful moments you shared with us. 👍",5,2015,05,26
60,Fun in Barcelona,"Clean hotel, friendly staff and GREAT location!!!  Stayed 3 days in Barcelona.  Definitely will return and stay at the Oriente Atiram. Be sure to see Sagrada Familia....beautiful and awesome!  La Rambla is great shopping area, but many others to see as well.  Good food too!

60,Just ok,"good clean rooms but nothing exceptional , there is nothing more to say .............................................I felt it was sneaky overpriced.
The location was very good. With the room I got was extremely small.",3,2015,05,23
60,Awful. No natural light. No bar,"Our room was nothing like the advertised pictures posted in the brochure and webpage. Old tatty furniture, cracked sink with a hole in it. No natural light, just builders scaffolding, planks and netting. We had to go to reception to find out the weather. No bar area, the only lounge area was a few chairs in reception. The patio doors were badly screwed together leaving an inch gap, making the room cold and extremely noisy. The worst hotel we have ever stayed in, they should be ashamed to offer such poor accomodation.",1,2015,05,22
60,Ticked All Our Boxes,"To call it a basic hotel would be unfair, so let us say that is a no frills hotel.

The reception is perhaps a little tired but the staff are cheerful, polite, helpful and efficient. There are some comfortable sofa's to pass the time on if you need and they are quite happy to stow your bags away in a secure room if you check out but have a later flight like we did. There is a coffee vending machine with a soft drinks machine attached. At 2 euros for a very small bottle of water it is a bit dear for what it is. But at least it's there if you want it.

We got a very comfortable clean room with good enough furniture, a very good shower, enough space in the wardrobe for our clothes. It would have been nice if there had been a fridge to store some of the bottled water to keep it cool but if you upgrade your room then you will get a minibar. You do get a safe in which to secure your valuables though. The breakfast room was really nice place to enjoy your coffee and breakfast. It was really nice, light and airy and the food is good enough. Fresh coffee would benice but as is so often the case it comes from a vending machine, nt bad though. The whole place was scrupulously clean and tidy.

But the best bit of the place is the location. It is just about halfway along Las Ramblas so set your foot out the door and you are right amongst things on that busy promenade. So for stepping out and getting anywhere you could not ask for better. The metro station is just a few metres away, there is a taxi rank opposite and you are right on the threshold of most things you came to see!

We had a room (218) at the back so no view other than the civil guard car park and a brick wall but it was reletively quiet. We slept with the window open as it was warm and preferred that to the air conditioning - no reason other than personal preference - and we found it quiet enough to sleep easily.

There is nothing fancy or extra here but that's not why you come to this place. You come here to have a bed for the night and quick and easy access to the sights of the city and for that it is absolutely perfect.",4,2015,05,21
60,Security failure - strange man entered room when we were asleep,"We checked in to room 303 at the Hotel Oriente on Friday 15th May and checked out on Sunday 17th May. I am writing this review to highlight a particularly concerning incident that occured in the early hours of Sunday morning, and the completely inadequate response of the hotel to it.

Around 7.10am-7.15am sunday morning, when my friend and I were asleep in bed, a strange man entered our room and turned on the light, waking us up. He appeared to be Japanese and was speaking a foreign language (we assume Japanese) when he turned on the light. We were very shocked to be awoken by a strange man, and he seemed equally surprised when he saw us, eventually said 'sorry' in English, and left.

We assume that this was an innocent mistake, as no harm was done to us and none of our belongings were taken, but the fact that a stranger can enter what should have been a locked hotel room is extremely worrying!

We reported this incident to the hotel reception in the morning, in the hope that they could find out what had happened and reassure us that whatever the problem was - whether the wrong key card being issued by reception or the door lock being faulty - it would be fixed. As we were checking out that day it was not for ourselves that we were concerned, but for future hotel guests. I really do not want to read about a guest at this hotel being attacked in this room in the future!

The hotel's response has not been reassuring. At first we had trouble making the reception staff understand what had happened - though we were not entirely convinced that they didn't understand and were not just playing dumb to avoid the issue, to be honest, since the first member of staff we spoke to understood us well enough to say that it should not be possible ('No! It shouldn't be!' we replied), then spoke to the other member of staff at length in either Spanish or Catalan, and she turned around and told us that the street noise (which is terrible) is out of their control - which is not at all what we had been complaining about. We persisted with the second member of staff, who peered at her computer and said she couldn't see anything, and that the manager was not in until the next day, so we could not speak to him. We finally persuaded her to phone the manager, since she didn't offer any other reassurance or resolution.

After a lengthy phone call she told us to leave our contact details, and that the manager would check the cameras and get back to us on monday.

On tuesday I actually received a response from the manager. He claims that the cameras and the door locked have been checked and show nothing, and hopes that we will stay at the Oriente again. As if! Clearly they don't have adequate security camera coverage (I didn't see a single camera in the corrider outside our room) and presumably the lock on room 303 is faulty.

It seems they are unable to ensure their rooms are secure, unable to detect that their rooms are not secure even when informed of the fact, and happy to do absolutely nothing to make sure they are secure. 

Do not stay at this hotel if you value your security. if you've already booked it, make sure they don't give you room 303.",1,2015,05,20
60,Great Central Hotel!,"The rooms were spacious and clean, toiletries were replenished daily - all requests were dealt with efficiently by both reception and housekeeping staff. Fantastic location, in which we were 5 minutes from the Harbour, 10 minutes from Hard Rock Café, 5 minutes from the City Sighting Tours and 1 minute from the Metro - wouldn't recommend upgrading to the high speed WiFi as the free WiFi is more than fast enough. Overall, a lovely stay in a central hotel for Barcelona, would highly recommend!",4,2015,05,20

60,Oriente Atiram Hotel,"The location of the hotel is fantastic, right in the heart of the city. It was very clean. The price was average for the area, as a 3 star. Staff were freindly. A lot of noise from the street at night, but you are in a city. I would use this hotel again.",3,2015,05,20
60,Great central Hotel ideal for a weekend Break,"We spent last weekend at the Oriente Hotel with 6 friends hoping to see some of the sights in Barcelona. Overall we had a great weekend made even better due to the central location of this hotel on Las Ramblas. Check in was quick and efficient and the rooms, though small were spotless and more than adequate for a weekend break. Breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice. The hotel is in a great location with many restaurants close by and access to the marina area and Place Catalunya in easy walking distance. Overall a great hotel in a central location.",5,2015,05,19
60,Noisy and smelly,"We booked and paid several months ahead and asked specifically for a quiet room. Considering how expensive it was, you would imagine such request would be considered by the staff. We were given first floor next to the Ramblas.  When complaining, we were offered another room: next to the lifts with no windows and sharing the ventilation with the kitchen. All our clothes smelled deep frying. When complaining (again), our compensation was one free breakfast. Our conclusion? If staying here, you better watch where they locate you. (Or, choose another hotel - That's what we will do next time we go to Barcelona.) ",1,2015,05,19
60,My Wife's 50th Birthday Celebrations in Barcelona!,"Clearly we were disappointed to be at the back of the hotel where extensive renovations were taking place at the time of our visit. I would imagine that there is a surcharge to have a room at the front of the hotel looking over Las Ramblas, but reception did not offer us this facility when checking in despite the hotel been fairly quiet. The staff were excellent and very friendly and we decided to eat out for breakfast to cut down costs. I can certainly recommend this hotel and it's fantastic location.We shall return!",4,2015,05,19
60,LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!!!,"My friend and I have just spent 6 days at the Oriente Atiram, chosen for its location on Las Ramblas. Both our rooms were very quiet, overlooking the roof of the Breakfast Room below so away from the noisy street. It was very clean, spacious and plenty of storage space. I had an air conditioning unit but I don't think my friend did. However, the temperature was not too hot so not a problem. The staff were efficient and very helpful. Initially we both had a problem with our safety deposit boxes in the wardrobe but a man came up and fixed them immediately, although it was late when we arrived there. The Breakfast Room was spacious and very bright and the menu fairly typically European.  For other meals, Las Ramblas is FULL of restaurants so food is never a problem! The hotel is within easy walking distance of Port Vell for either the Maremagnum complex and Aquarium, boat trips or catching the Hop On Hop Off buses. In the other direction is Place de Catalunya to board either buses or coaches. We booked the Barcelona City Tours HO HO bus for 2 days, doing both the Orange and the Green Route. We also took an evening coach trip to the Montjuic Magic Fountains, which were absolutely fabulous! Tourist Information (opposite the hotel) booked this for us.  On our last afternoon, we made a spontaneous decision to take a 1.5 hr. boat trip but, whilst it was a bit windy at the start, once out in the open sea it proved to be EXTREMELY choppy with a very strong biting cold wind and, wearing thin tops, we were absolutely frozen as the sea was so rough we couldn't move out of our seats on deck to get downstairs under cover! The moral of this is - PLAN your trip before leaving the hotel and take a jacket just in case!  One other tip - it might be an idea to take a 6 in. diameter silicone or rubber disc in case your wash basin plug leaks, which has happened to me on a few occasions, including this time.  Finally, we would definitely return to this hotel if we visit Barcelona again.",4,2015,05,18
60,Good hotel at a good price,"My elderly ,active mum and I had a FAB time in Barcelona 
I chose this hotel for its location as it was in Las Ramblas in the heart of old Bacelona
I also chose it as it looked good for the price.
We had a lovely room at the side/back of the hotel looking out on a Brick wall  I would normally have complained however it was peaceful and the room was a good size modern with good air conditioning good size size shower and plenty of storage space and we were out all day coming back to change for dinner so why complain?
We stayed purely on a room basis going out to eat which was fun
My only negative was that the evening reception staff were not too helpful however the day reception staff were excellent offering Fantastic customer service.
The only thing the room could have had was Tea or coffee available in the room but that does not happen in European cities
However the hotel did have a vending machine in the lobby but for our time there was not no Tea available !!
Just bear in mind McDonalds is across the street for Tea,coffee,hot choc to take away
On the whole a good hotel and a pleasant stay",4,2015,05,13

60,Highlight ? .. Leaving on the last day.,"Reception experience - Vaguely scruffy and untidy staff, pleasant enough but unprofessional. 
   Lift lobby had a mirror covered with white graffiti of matchstick men, instructions to enjoy Barcelona and other undefineable scrawlings  - already feeling ""What are we doing here?""
   Entered room (440) - airless and stale - no fridge - no minibar. Dark and dismal owing to scaffolding and builders netting outside which no-one had the courtesy to warn us about. Window SCREWED shut with notice saying this was for security reasons. We couldn't get a through draught and the air con wouldn't work. Being in the room at all was a hot, sticky, sweaty and thoroughly miserable experience.
   More graffiti on room mirror instructing us to ""enjoy Barcelona"".
   On checking out (Oh bliss!) we were confronted with a ""Tourist Tax"" bill to pay which no-one had ever mentioned and we didn't even know about it. THAT LEAVES A REALLY BAD FEELING TO TOP OFF AN AWFUL EXPERIENCE.
   As for Barcelona itself .... Fantastic city ....  It's a shame that Barcelona tourism can allow the tainting of an otherwise brilliant five night break by allowing rooms like this hovel to be rented out.",1,2015,05,06
60,Perfect Location,"The Hotel is quite good. Expecially the location!!!

But: If possible, book without breakfast. Even the offer of 9,-€ p.P. isn't worth it. You can get a much better breakfast for half of the price at the near market, 100m next to it.",4,2015,05,04
60,"Sufficient for the purpose, great location","The hotel was chosen for its promise of being a renovation of an older building (= historical ambience) and also for its key location. Well, it was certainly modern enough, but had little 'old Barcelona' charm as I had hoped. However, that was not important as the location was so good. It was a great place to come and go from, especially to all the main sights we had planned to see. We had only two full days there so wanted to easily travel to our chosen spots.

At first the young lady at reception was a little cool, but warmed up nicely once payment was successfully achieved (my credit card would not work at all during my stay there).From then on we had all the help we needed, e.g. how to find a certain restaurant, best route to take to quickly get to Sagrada Familia, where to buy stamps (although they were wrong on that - you need to go to the local Tabac a few streets down), recommendations on other restaurants. 

The room itself was small (basically room for a double bed and a wardrobe), but it was sufficient for our needs - we spent little time in our room, but we slept well and were able to shower (soap, shampoo & shower gel provided) and get ready for the day. As some other reviewers commented, there are no tea or coffee-making or ironing facilities, which yes, would have been a plus, but we managed well without. It also gave a good excuse to go out for a cup of coffee!

Be sure to take plenty of cash with you, because 1. It can be easily tucked away either in a belly bag or, ladies, in your 'African purse' (= bra), 2. Your card can be copied and more easily lifted, and 3. As in my case, might refuse to work for some unknown and unresolved reason. 

Finally, there had been some reviews that had mentioned the noisiness of rooms facing the street, so we took that advice and requested (upon our arival) a room facing the inner court. Fortunately we got it, and my travel companion, who is a bad sleeper, was at least ensured that we heard the minimum of noise during the nights.  ",3,2015,05,04

Staff members were helpful despite a very busy day on Sept. 11, 2014 with Catalunya National Day and 2 million Catalans marching for independence.

We used the hop on hop off sightseeing bus.

60,Barcelona - Friend's Wedding and leisure time,"This is the perfect place to stay in if you want to be in near most of the tourist spots around La Ramblas.  Everything to metro, supermarkets, beautiful restaurants and markets are walking distances.  Taxi stand can be found across the road and easy to flag down.  You'll find a small coffee shop across the road from the hotel entering Plaza Rieal for tea and coffee as the hotel doesn't offer a kettle or teabags in each room.  
My only complaint about this hotel is the misleading information on their website to which I have a snapshot of saying ironing service is available which was not the case.  I explained to the receptionist that the website had explicitly mentioned ironing service separate from laundry service to which I was told there was a mistake on the website.  Since my group and I and were in Barcelona for a wedding, an iron would have been ideal for us to use in our rooms instead of asking to pay over 14 euros for each dress to be ironed.  Luckily the bride lent us her travel iron! Point to note: invest in a travel iron!",3,2015,04,21

60,Very central location,"This was a nice hotel, right in the middle of Las Ramblas, and very handy for the Metro.  The first room we were given had building works outside but when I asked if we could move, they moved us to an upgraded room (overlooking La Rambla) with no problems and no charge!  The breakfast was ok for the price, basic but lots of it, and reception staff were very friendly to us.  The room wasn't luxurious (I didn't expect it to be at the price we paid) but it was very clean and comfortable.  We had a slight hiccup with the bill on checking out but it was put right with no fuss.  I'd stay here again.",4,2015,04,21
60,Great Location,"If you want to be right on Las Ramblas, with a degree of comfort and dont mind a bit of noise then the Oriente is the place for you.
The location is superb and the staff are friendly enough without seeming to care too much. We had a room overlooking the Ramblas which was a little noisy but after a few glasses of wine of an evening it wasnt so noisy as to interrupt sleep.
I would say this is probably more of a hotel for couples than for children as the rooms that we had werent that big, however they may have bigger rooms at the rear of the hotel if you ask.",4,2015,04,20
60,They took a Personal belonging for the room.,"Upon arrival I was pleasantly suprised with the location! However as soon as we entered the hotel it went completely down hill from there. Staff were nothing but rude once telling us where our room was we entered the room to find it freezing cold as the balcony doors would not shut. Then the view was just dust and schafolding. We decided to put up with it for the first night as it was a long day travelling. Day two we left the hotel to begin some sightseeing. Once the day had finished we arrived back at the hotel to discover the room had been cleaned and a very personally item had been taken from the room. As soon as we realised this we questioned the receptionist who was incredibly unsympathetic. When I asked to speak to the manager I got questioned why? I explained about the room situation which they did resolved and moved us after having a memeber of staff trying to fix the broken balcony door. Even after we had moved rooms every day we asked about what is being done about the personal item to which the response was always we will know more tomorrow... It got to our final day of our trip and we requested the manager to make a formal complaint to which the response was no, there is no manager here. 

I was quite honestly disgusted with not only the attitude of the staff but the fact we went to Barcelona with a incredibly personal item to have to return to the UK without it. It was worth no money but it is an irrplaceable item which the staff did not understand. 

I would personally not recommend this hotel to anyone!",1,2015,04,18
60,3 night family break,"We had a lovely stay at this very clean & well run hotel. Superb location in the middle of a 10 minute walk to Placa de Catalunia one way & The Port/Marina the other way. Didn't use breakfast as plenty of local places all around. Asked for quiet rooms & got just that. Extra night booked when flights were cancelled, staff really helpful in adjusting booking & printing off new boarding information. Everyone is entitled to an opinion but any negative reviews about the hotel environment are not accurate in our experience.  Staff at reception don't smile too much but are efficient & helpful, speaking good English. Barcelona in general we recommend hop on hop off bus tours to get around(book tickets on line to save about 25%). Football match at Camp Nou is epic ( stadium tour on match days doesn't allow much more than museum & small view of pitch so go another day when pitch, press rooms, commentary boxes and changing rooms are allowed) cruise around Marina is a pleasant experience, parc Guell is lovely too. No hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone.",5,2015,04,16

60,Great location but a bit shabby,"Reasonably priced and ideally situated, hotel Oriente seems like a bargain. Sadly, despite its beautiful facade, the overall lack of quality was a let down. I was there with my wife and our bed was two single beds pushed together which tended to move apart leaving a gap during the night. They were also very uncomfortable so neither of us slept well. The shower unit was tiny and the doors were very wobbly, as thought they might fall off. My wife was given a nasty fright by a sudden change in water temperature, so be careful of that. On the plus side, the location couldn't be better, it is very clean and the staff were friendly, helpful and efficient.",3,2015,04,12

60,Average hotel,"This hotel is absolutely ""ok"" for a stay in Barcelona.The front desk isn't very nice but the building is old and beautiful.The rooms are okey, but the beds are not soft at all!And the breakfast is just ""ok"" and not more than that...The location is perfect!:)",3,2015,04,04
60,Fantastic location!,"Spent 3 nights here, great location and friendly staff. Our family room was clean and beds comfy. It was located very near the metro, which was really helpful to get around. Breakfast was nice and I would stay here again.",4,2015,03,31
60,Perfect location,"Set on Las Ramblas, and not too expensive.
Staff very attentive. Breakfast are good and pleasant under a large veranda.
Room clean and confortable.
Very convenience location (ramblas, port, Palais Guel, Opera...)",4,2015,03,31
60,Great Stay,"The staff were responsive and attentive. The location is very convenient to all famous scenic spots. Just the building is a bit old but it was so far okay. With lots of restaurants nearby, easy access to all kinds of delicious food",4,2015,03,30
60,Great place to stay,"Stayed here for 5 nights on Barrhead travel deal.  Hotel was great - large spotless room, clean towels every day, room cleaned daily and everyone helpful and friendly.  Great location right in the middle of Las Ramblas, could not have been better if we had stayed in a 5 star hotel.  Booked room only, so took own kettle.  Super.",5,2015,03,27
60,Perfect location,"Set on Las Ramblas and not too expensive. Comfortable rooms, and including an adequate breakfast , we were quite happy with our stay. The only downside was  that it was noisy next door  when they came in at 4am, from clubbing, (I expect), however, when Reception were informed, it did stop. There was a plaque outside stating Hans Christian Anderson had stayed there too!",4,2015,03,27
60,"Excellent location , average rooms","full points on location - makes it perfect to walk any where and everywhere important(almost) . Fairly average service - rooms average ( dirty walls) - friendly staff . I would definitely stay here again , however as mentioned earlier , the location is the main reason. We had breakfast included - decent options however not exciting or creative hence can't give full points on that . But over all I would recommend the place.",3,2015,03,27
60,"Great Location, Okay Room, Mediocre Service and Very Poor Breakfast.","We stayed for for four nights, it's main attraction being the location, which is excellent for exploring Barcelona. The staff were okay, some being good and others a little surly on occasion.
Our room, 308, was a reasonable size with en-suite bathroom - both were okay but nothing special. The air-con was completely hopeless, it seemed only capable of heating the room irrespective of the setting chosen; consequently, we had to leave the window open to achieve a tolerable climate within the room. Also, this hotel employs card locking systems that require the doors to be slammed shut; I am mystified as to why such hotels do nothing to cushion the closure and reduce unnecessary noise.
The hotel as a whole was okay but rather shabby in the main reception area, despite their quite ornate facade that promised good things.
What was unacceptable however was the breakfast, which fortunately we only sampled on one morning. It was apparent that each arriving guest was offered a 'deal' whereby, if upon arrival they signed up for breakfast each day they could have it for 9 euros rather than 13.5 euros per head per day. Thank god we weren't seduced into this lousy deal - we tried it one day and can honestly say that it's perhaps one of the worst offerings that I've encountered in a hotel. Unbelieveably, the cooked breakfast that comprised bacon, sausages and a stodge claiming to be scrambled eggs was literally clap cold; when I pointed this out the waiter was apologetic and set about actually turning the hot trays on. The coffee machine dispensed mediocre nescafe and the juices were cheap reconstituted powder versions. Fortunately, the croissants and fruit were okay. This delightful experience was accompanied by edgy rap music!

When checking out, I raised the breakfast issue and suggested that it was unreasonable to charge the full 27 euros given the problems - they knocked off 4 euros.
I urge future visitors to decline the in-house breakfast and instead spend your money in one of the many cafes nearby, who are capable of offering palatable food.",3,2015,03,26
60,Few days in Barcelona,"A very clean  hotel with friendly,helpful staff.so nice  to get clean bedding and towels each day!just one draw back for me......the beds are rather hard,so if you have a back problem this may not be for you!Although the management very kindly found me a slightly softer mattress which was great!
Great location,but be prepared it is very lively at night on the Ramblas so can be noisey...but part of the charm I guess.In all a  very good stay and would return.",4,2015,03,25
60,nice,nice hotel because it close to everything and worth the money.  but not more than that. the room was small and not impressive. the wifi was good and always worked. they was nice and speak good English. we didn't eat in the hotel but there a lot of restaurants near the hotel so you don't have to worry about that.,3,2015,03,25
60,Great Location and good service,"I read the very mixed reviews about this hotel, but decided to give it a go, mainly because of its location.  What a surprise, the location, as expected was perfect, the staff were friendly and helpful, the room was a good size and very clean, what more could you ask for.  There have been comments about the breakfast, possibly justified if you wanted an ""English"" breakfast, but this is Spain, it was good, plenty of coffee, fruit juices, cheese, meats, breads and pastries as well as the not so good scrambled egg.  When in Spain do as the Spanish do.  All in all a pleasurable stay in a good hotel.",5,2015,03,23
60,Not a pleasant experience,"Well situated but the breakfast offering was not great, the room was very small for a double sharing, wifi very slow, a 16th birthday party downstairs went on till 4 in the morning with very loud music playing and a total lack of respect for the guests in the hotel. Overall will not be visiting this hotel again. If you stay on the 3rd floor and up I think it would be better.",1,2015,03,23
60,Weekend in Barca,"Good location, close to metro and walking distance of all sights. Room clean and comfortable. Buffet breakfast good but pricey. Right in La Rambla so easy to get the vibe but not too noisy. Would stay again.",4,2015,03,21
60,In the middle of the action.,"We arrived at the Hotel 3/12 at 945 pm and where not allowed to check in until 1 pm after a 9 hour flight from Miami . The hotel is middle of the action easily close to all the attractions in Centro Madrid by walking. The room we got was a family ,a little small for a family of four adults but bathroom was very large. Overall the hotel was ok but location was great.",4,2015,03,18
60,Short break to Barcelona,"Good location, hot buffet and friendly staff,convenient location to see the sights metro station nearby good eating places . I bought saffron from Bouqueria but cheaper in london went to see flamenco vast difference in price chose to go to the one in playa rial",4,2015,03,18
60,Great location for the price - helpful staff,"We stayed here for 6 nights in March and really enjoyed it.  The hotel is located RIGHT on la rambla, about a 5 minute walk from Port Vell and maybe a 10 minute walk in the other direction up to Placa Catalunya. You're also a stone's throw away from La Boqueria as well as the Barrio Gotico. 

The room was small and simple but clean and well maintained. The staff was also nice and very helpful, even bringing us extra glasses and ice late one night when we had forgotten to ask for them earlier. 

Our room was directly overlooking La Rambla so it's a little loud at night (particularly if you are there on a weekend) but for us it was all a part of the Barcelona experience. However perhaps ask for a room not overlooking the street if you are a light sleeper who goes to bed early.

Overall, a very nice stay and I'd recommend Oriente Atiram to anyone visiting Barcelona who is looking for a clean and safe hotel right in the middle of things!",4,2015,03,16
60,good value,stayed here for four nights on a city break.booked a standard double. good location in middle of las ramblas. couldn't fault anything. rooms clean & spacious. towels changed daily. bonus was plenty of hot water for shower & bath which was needed after spending long days walking taking in all the sights. only complaint would be lack of tea/coffee making facilities.overall good value for money and would return here if we came back to barcelona.,4,2015,03,15
60,Excellent Choice!,"Excellent location, close to metro overall good choice of hotel, had room overlooking Las Rambla in the heart of Barcelona when returning to Barcelona will check availability first before booking anywhere else.",5,2015,03,10
60,Perfect location for visiting Barcelona,"Even though I was in barcelona again on business, the location of this hotel, right on La Rambla, with all the hustle and bustle of what you want to expect from Barcelona, made this trip very enjoyable.

The staff at the hotel were very helpful and accommodating and the rooms were clean and comfortable.

If two people were staying in a room, I guess the wardrobes could be bigger, but overall, thats the only slight issue. 

Open the doors of the hotel, and your right on Rambla with an abundance of restaurants, bars, culture, the seafront, what else do you need, apart from being here for pleasure and not business :(",4,2015,03,08
60,Happy time at Oriente Atiram,"We are at the Rambla in a beautiful building, with a good service, clean and comfortable rooms and a great breakfast, with an only problem, they don't have brown bread. My room was on ""the Rambla"". It was winter so I could shut the windows, otherwise it would be really noisy.",4,2015,03,02
60,Prelude to an adventure,"I was so excited to finally reach the hotel that my pre experience will color this review; upon renting a car (after a long journey from New York),we proceeded to las ramblas seeking the hotel when we were alerted trhough a tap on the window that ""you have a flat tire"", this from a young man on a bike, he motioned us to follow him (warning) to park the car and he would have someone help us; thank god, 2 policemen showed up and told us this is a prevalent scam current in Barcelona where when luggage is apparent in a car's window, your tire would be slashed, offer to help, and then.....theft of all.  We were responsible for a tow and a new tire. Needless to say, it was nirvana when we arrived at the hotel.  Staff was outstanding, helpful and friendly, room though modest had a balcony overlooking the ramblas and was neat and tidy. Breakfast was extra but worth the convenience , simple but ample.. This was our first of 4 places we would be staying during our road trip to france and our precruise from Barcelona.",4,2015,02,28
60,Decent budget hotel,"Room was ok, nice and clean. Only problem was with the noise. There was a lot of banging doors late at night and early morning which made it hard to sleep. Could also hear a lot of voices. The breakfast wasn't great but for the price can't really fault. Overall was a pleasant stay.",3,2015,02,26
60,Great Location,"What can I say about the Hotel Oriente great location and friendly staff, badly in need of an update, it must have been fabulous in its heyday.  We stayed in room 107 on 1st floor the room and furniture were very tired and it was extremely dark in the room due to for being carried out at the side of the hotel . The balcony window could not be opened for safety reasons and the side was covered in scaffolding and plastic, it felt more like a cell, fortunately we did not spend much time in the room as it was only a base for our exploring.",3,2015,02,24
60,"Nice hotel, great location, nice service, excellent staff","Excellent location, family room for 3 was a little small but we were only there for long weekend so didn't mind. Not too noisy considering location, room was serviced every day and staff were very friendly and considerate, would recommend this hotel to everyone",4,2015,02,23
60,Texas girl says its ok.,"Decent location on Ramblas--however any location on Ramblas will be ok. Laundromat/ washateria is 2 blocks away if needed. The beach is a 8-12 euro cab ride away.  Would I stay here again????....maybe, but there is many options on Ramblas.  Next time I may consider a hotel closer to the beach.  The room was a decent size compared to other hotels in Europe.  Overall-- it was a GOOD BANG FOR MY BUCK-- so I approve and recommend this to people on a budget. It's an appropriate hotel for singles, families, or groups.

There was no available rooms until 14:00 (2pm)...which was a disaster since I was tired and fresh off a flight.",3,2015,02,23
60,Fair price for central hotel,"I shared a room with a friend, it would have been slightly better if the bathroom door had closed properly, the rooms aren't numbered consecutively which is hilarious.  Fairly priced for a really central hotel, very clean, breakfast was ok & served in a beautiful room.  Next door to a really good restaurant and bar.  I would stay at this hotel again. ",4,2015,02,22
60,Hotel ok would have been lovely years ago but absolutely nothing to complain about,"Hotel very nice, very nice staff and can't help you enough, nice rooms for what you pay for, but overall a great hotel for location, service and cleanliness. Nice and quiet even tho it's right on la ramblas.",5,2015,02,21
60,Great hotel experiente! Perfect location in Barcelona. Soul state again.,"Next time im Barcelona, I'll stay there again. Great location, Nice and clean rooms. Breakfast could be better. Since my room was on The 1st floor, We would hear a lot of noise coming from The Rambla, but The view, for sure, compansate this issue. ",4,2015,02,20
60,Nice Hotel with good service and right in the center,"Nice Hotel with good service and right in the center
If I'll visit Barcelona again there is a good chance I'll return to this Hotel
Staff was very helpful and kind
Center of Las Ramblas
Clean Rooms 
......",4,2015,02,20
60,If you want good location- this is it,"We stayed for one night before heading elsewhere in Spain and the location can't be beat since you're literally on the main st.  

The rooms are small and outdated but perfectly suitable.  It would have been nice to have a balcony though. We couldn't justify paying the prices we saw for other hotels when we were essentially in the room for just hours. I'm not sure what the prices are at these days but for us it was perfect.  

If you're looking for posh though, this isn't it. ",4,2015,02,17
60,Excellent location and nice hotel,"This hotel is clean comfortable and a great location! The staff were friendly and very helpful, and spoke perfect English. 

If you like to walk to all the must see sights then this is the hotel for you, the gothic area is within a 10 to 15 minute walk. Where the museum of Picasso, the cathedral and many more must see attractions near by.",5,2015,02,15
60,La Rambla,"The reason I booked this hotel was because of it's location and inexpensive price. 
The hotel is on La Rambla and is easy walking distance to the gothic quarter and even Eixample, if you enjoy exploring on foot.
The Gothic quarter is a 10/15 minute walk and Eixample around 25 minutes.
We loved that Palau Quell was around the corner from the hotel - 2 minutes away!
The metro station is a few minutes away from the hotel and we found it very easy to use when travelling to Park Quell, Sagrada Familia and also La Pedrera.

The hotel itself was a very pleasant surprise as it had character being a renovated ex convent and we found the room welcoming, comfortable, clean, peaceful and safe. We even loved the design of the bed linen and curtains!

The staff were all really friendly and were happy to help answer any questions that we had.

I have already recommended this hotel to my friends and as I would love to go back to Barcelona at some point, I am positive that when I do, I will being staying at The Oriente again.
I don't have anything bad to say about it.",5,2015,02,14
60,very good value for money and great location,"A great location on the ramblas  and accross the plaza reial , this 3 star hotel is also fairly unexpensive in its category . An old typical building completely renewed ,  the rooms are ""new"" , clean, and match the local 3 stars . Room on the Rambla may be a bit Noisy  as late night activity is just Under the balcony 
Great breakfast and friendly staff at the reception",4,2015,02,08
60,Great Choice in the Heart of the Action,"We stayed 1 night at the Oriente before embarking on a cruise from Barcelona and it was perfect. Our overnight flight from NYC arrived in Barcelona early in the morning and we wondered if the Oriente would allow us to have a room immediately...they did, as if this is their standard procedure. The front staff were extremely friendly, helpful and tolerant of my attempts to converse in Spanish (and filling the gaps w/English when necessary). Don't expect a huge lobby and lots of space...it is an older/smaller building in a prime area but it is quite clean and our room was totally updated and quiet (not facing the action packed Las Ramblas).  There is a glass enclosed courtyard for a nice breakfast, again staffed by friendly and helpful folks. They have a very efficient/friendly luggage storage room that allowed us to leave our baggage while we explored Barcelona until leaving for our ship in the late afternoon the next day. In all we were quite pleased with our experience at the Oriente Atiram.",5,2015,02,07
60,Good hotel for Barcelona City Break,"A friendly and efficiently run central hotel five minutes walk from Placa Catalunya in La Ramblas.  An interesting building which had been a convent with the breakfast room in the courtyard with a glazed roof.We had comfortable beds, pleasant breakfasts and a Juliet balcony to our nice room.  A bit noisy at night but lovely to people watch.  A shame the bar & cafe were closed in the winter months - this could be mentioned on the website but plenty of street cafes close by. Easy access to all public transport and would highly recommend the tourist buses.  Take advantage of the 9 Euro breakfast which was only mentioned in the lift!  Be wary of booking AeroCity shuttle from airport as we waited for over an hour and had to phone them. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2015,02,03
60,you get what you pay for,"The hotel is  centrally located on the Rambla, just across from Plaça Real and a few steps to the metro stop Liceu. 
Clean decent sized room, decorated in some sort of shabby chic style (more shabby than chic). I asked for a quiet room and was given one the side of the building; even so night time noise from the street made it impossible to sleep undisturbed. The bed was very hard and the room rather cold, with no extra blankets. Staff however was very friendly and helpfull.  
All in all, the price and the location made up for the deficiencies.",3,2015,02,03
60,Nice hotel,"Really lovely hotel set right on La Ramblas. It's quite grand and is really rather large! We had a twin room on the third floor which had a juliet balcony looking straight out onto La Ramblas which was lovely. The only issue we had was that the door wasn't shutting quite right and the room was freezing. There were no extra blankets in the room and it made for a very cold January night, but we asked for extra bedding the next morning and it was delivered to our room within ten minutes. Hugely appreciated, made things much more comfortable for the next night. There is reasonable free wifi there too which is great. I would certainly recommend this hotel. I didn't find there was any issues with noise from the street either which was great. And there is a 24 hour reception desk so arriving late at night is no problem at all. There's also a lock up luggage storage room within the hotel if you need to make use of that after check out. Would stay again.",4,2015,01,29
60,Good balue for money,Grate location. Nice and comftable room. Bad breakfast. Good service. Neer la boqeria market and close to the metro. No smoking in rooms (problem for smokers). There is no one good coffee in the hotel!,4,2015,01,29
60,"Hotel Oriente Atiram , Nice clean and good location","We had sone very good days at the Hotel the room was OK, clean and the location at the Rambla was good,  The 9€ breakfast was good and we could rent bicycles in the reception.
5 minutes walk to the metro with train to the Airport,
However a Taxi to Airport is 30 € and the train is slow.",4,2015,01,26

60,"Beautiful facility, great nightlife location","This building fronts onto La Rambla, so be prepared for lots of loud activity out on the street until the early morning hours most nights. Or better yet, just stay out and enjoy the Spanish community and ambiance of La Rambla and shut some bars down! The building and lobby are beautiful, clean, and well maintained. Our room was a ""double,"" because we needed to sleep four, but it was pretty small compared with other rooms we stayed in while visiting Spain in December, 2014. Basically a fold-out sofa bed and two doubles pushed together. It worked for the one night we needed it, but it would've gotten old if we were staying any length of time.",4,2015,01,14
60,Great Location- Below Average Hotel,"The only absolutely great feature of this hotel was the location.  Right in the middle of Las Ramblas.  Hotel staff was also very courteous and helpful, however, room quality is low.  We stayed in a family room on the Las Ramblas side.  Beds are no more than an upgraded cot and the lack of any built in furniture, made the room feel more like a missionary than a quality hotel.  Bathroom had a strange sewage smell that would go away if you opened the window.  Staying on the Las Ramblas side is great if you want to people watch (there's a nice balcony to do so) but it does tend to be loud throughout the night.
Don't waste you money on the breakfast.  We did purchase it one day but like the rest of the guests we played it safe and stuck with the toast.  There is a Dunkin Donuts down the street that sells sandwiches that was nice.",2,2015,01,08
60,Family vacation in Barcelona for 1 week,"Perfect location, clean room, big enough for 4 persons, helpful stuff, I would suggest it fo all kind of vacation. Subway is very close and perfect walking around or by bicycle 24 hours a day. All reastaurants, bars and market is in walking distance.",4,2015,01,08

60,GOOD HOTEL FOR THE MONEY,Stayed at the Oriente Atiram over New Year for 4 days.  Had a room overlooking the Ramblas which was great as the whole Ramblas is completely lit up with lights on every tree. The hotel is ideally situated nearly half way up so you can access all areas.  Its a 6 - 7 min walk to the marina/seafront where there is a shopping centre right next to the aquarium which was really good.  The whole New Year was great as there is a large square just opposite the hotel which was full of people celebrating so the whole atmosphere was brilliant.  The rooms are small and basic but it's just what you need.  We had Room only so ate breakfast out every day.  There are loads of bars and restaurants all around so you are spoilt for a choice of where to eat.  The airport is only 20 mins in a taxi which was £30 euros.  If I went back to Barcelona I would definatly go back to this hotel.,4,2015,01,07
60,Recommend,"Good location and reasonable priced. Room was spacious and clean.  Noisy but we knew this from reviews and as on main street not surprising.
Breakfast was not worth the money but apart from that we had a lovely stay.",4,2015,01,05
60,Barcelona,"A big thank you to Rosa Duran the manager of the hotel - she was so helpful yesterday. Passing through Barcelona eon route to France we could not find anywhere to print our train ticket . Not staying at the hotel , but seeing the door to her office open ,we asked - she was so welcoming and immediately proceed to print our tickets knowing we were not even guests. 
Fiona and Marie from Ireland",5,2014,12,31
60,Great,The hotel is very well situated. We were able to visit museums and to move walking. The subway and the buses are also very near the hotel. It's considerable. The breakfast room is very pleasant. Super really. We keep adress for next time !,5,2014,12,30
60,Hmmm,"While the position of this hotel was well placed that was in my opinion the only good point. Wi-fi was only available by submitting your full name and email, even then it was limited and almost impossible to use, (swisscom) The room was clean but poor access to electrical sockets, there was no way to make a hot drink in the room either.  Sleeping was also difficult because the local trades people were shouting and errecting stalls all through the night, even with the windows closed it sounded as if we were sleeping in the street.  The lift was never in the  position so people were tripping in and out because of the step. The food was ok but having tried it once we stuck to toast for the rest of our stay.  I would not recommend this 3 star hotel.",1,2014,12,29
60,Perfick!!,"We visited Barca for a long weekend and although this was our 3rd choice hotel, we're very glad that the other two were full. We had a very adequate and well sized family room with a period wrought iron balcony, the decor has been modernized but the hotel retains much charm, and the breakfast was very very adequate, the staff charming, helpful with a great attitude.
I would have no hesitation in visiting the Oriente again, and of course, step out of the door and your on the La Rambla and two minute walk from the metro station Licieu.
I find no reason at all t be in any way negative, picky or find fault. We had a great time.",4,2014,12,18
60,Convenient and comfortable,"The location of this hotel was superb - on La Ramblas, within 1 minute of the metro, and 5 mins from the bus station. It was comfortable and clean, ideal as a base for a sightseeing trip.  Good service staff - no complaints at all.",5,2014,12,17
60,Very convenient and pleasant,"This is the second time I am going to this hotel that I have chosen for the very strategic location : las Ramblas just near my favourite square : the Plaza Real, and the pitoresque barrio gotico, 5 minutes walking from Placa de Cataluna where you can take the bus to the airport and from the port. I like it a lot. The staff is very nice and helpful.
We had a large room on the 4th floor with a balcony with the view over the Ramblas. The bed are very good and there are double glass windows to protect from the noise.
The breakfast is a little bit expensive if you take just one day but if you book for it for the week-end (2nights) you have a discount. 
Would recommend it without hesitation.",4,2014,12,15
60,Christmas trip to Barcelona,"We booked this 3 star hotel on the internet as the price was reasonable and because it is situated on Las Ramblas.  Our room had a balcony which was  was overlooking Las Ramblas and was clean and comfortable. We pre booked continental breakfast and the dining room, and quality of the food on offer, was very good.  ALL of the staff were pleasant and helpful and we will definitely book this hotel again for our next trip to Barcelona.",4,2014,12,15
60,"Very good experience, great location and good service","We spent only 1 night there, but we had a very good service; we arrived early in the morning and we expected to leave only the luggages and they managed to give us the rooms allready.

Brekfast was very good. Only the room could be better: it was clean but very ""essential"".",4,2014,12,15
60,Very Very good no problems at all.,"Spend 3 nights here fantastic location right on the Ramblas near to a Metro station, got the bus in from Airport 25 minutes €5.90 then a 10 minute walk to the Hotel, room clean and quiet fantastic shower, lovely room for breakfast, If you know in advance that you are going to have breakfast in the hotel then book it in advance at reception for the whole of your stay works out cheaper, breakfast very good hot food a bit cold but just used the microwave provided, coffee superb, staff very helpful and they have a secure luggage room, don't eat or drink on the Ramblas explore the side streets some great cafes and bars, would definitely stay again.",5,2014,12,13
60,hotel rating,"My wife and I stayed for a week in this hotel ,the room was clean ,towels changed daily and room serviced. 
Staff was excellent and most helpfull.
Location excellent for visiting Barcelona.
The lack of been able to boil a cup of tea in your room was a pity, also there is a few cosmetic jobs required,but they were working at some of them when we were there.
We intend to go back to this wonderful city and would have no hesitation in staying here again nor advising friends.
Overall for what we paid we had an excellent stay at this establishment",4,2014,12,12

Great hotel and good price, We would definitely stay there again. ",5,2014,12,10
60,Perfect starting point to discover the town,"The hotel is located in the middle of the Ramblas. Short walk to reach the old town, the olimpic village , Barceloneta and the water. Hotel is old but work is going on to keep it up and improve. Staff is friendly and helpful. Easy to reach fromm the airport  by bus and subway.",4,2014,12,10
60,Good location,"Hotel is in a good location in the middle of ramblas street and very close to metro station.
Room was spacious and sound  proof but the worst thing was the bed. It was hard snd small and you have to adjust mattresses from time to time.
TV was a small one but it was ok.
Wifi speed is ok but you have to register each time you want to connect.
Very strict to check in time at 02:00 pm, we arrived earlier at the morning but we had to wait for long time to check in.

Despite the negatives but It is good 3 star hotel at ramblas.

60,fabulous location,"This hotel was wonderful.  The location couldn't have been better, right in the middle of Las Ramblas. The rooms were good although would have liked a full length mirror.  There is a very nice tapas bar/breakfast cafe next door and the staff are friendly and helpful.  What more could we have asked for for a wonderful weekend in Barcelona",5,2014,12,08
60,Very good considering the price,"Very well located, the room was clean and we had good beds.
The staff members are eager to help.
One flaw with the bathroom: the floor is wet after a shower because thhere is no curtain or door. I chose to sweep the floor because I didn't want my elderly mother to slip and fall.",4,2014,12,07
60,"Great hotel, great location","The hotel was located in Ramblas, the centre of tourist attraction - a street full of shopping and restaurants. It is a walking distance to Barcelona Port. If you like a quiet holiday then you should not stay here as this full street is full of life until the wee hours of the morning. 

The hotel is 2 minutes away from the metro station which is very accessible to all parts of Barcelona. 

The staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast is ok. The rooms are not very spacious maybe because we were 4 of us in it. The bathroom was quite spacious and clean. 

Overall I would recommend this hotel to everyone",4,2014,12,06
60,Very Helpful staff,"I actually did not stay at this hotel, as I was in an apartment nearby. I ran into a major problem and needed to make an emergency international (US) call. I went into the lobby and told of my problem to the desk staff. They did not have a phone for me to use, but told me I could use their free Wi-Fi and instructed me how to log my I-pad on to their system. Within two minutes, I was connected and communicating with the US. Soon, my problem was solved and crisis averted. I thanked the staff, and they were very gracious and said if any more problems arise, I should feel free to use their Wi-Fi. I will definitely consider using this hotel for my next stay in Barcelona!!",4,2014,12,06
60,Very good central hotel,"Just returned from this hotel having spent 4 nights here.
The location is fantastic , you are right in the centre of the ramblas , not too far from the metro, bus station, and gothic area.
Staff were all helpful and friendly , room was cleaned everyday with fresh towels, room was modern , looks like it had been updated recently .
We had a city view looking over the ramblas , balcony is a French balcony so not enough room for a chair , but you can still stand and watch the world go by, even though view is road side , not realy that noisey.
If I was to stay in the ramblas area I would certainly stay here again and also recommend to friends.

Thanks
Mark.",4,2014,12,03
60,Great Location- Fabulous Staff,"We went for my friends 50th Birthday last weekend. The hotel is ideally situated on Las Ramblas, just a stones throw from the tube station. The staff are very friendly and helpful, with lots of info of where to go and how to get there. The rooms were clean & serviced each day. Our rooms were on the back or inner well of the hotel so very quiet.We had a great 2 night stay. Will be back!!",5,2014,12,03
60,I recommend this hotel to everyone,"It is a good hotel in the heart of Las Ramblas. Very good service and very helpful personnel. Aspecially for those who seek for a good, comfortable hotel in the heart of the city. It was a good vacation.",5,2014,12,03
60,Oriente Atiram- Barcelona,"I had a wonderful stay at the Oriente Atiram. The staff was exceptional and was always helpful. The room was clean and the hotel is in a great area with easy access to the metro. Lots of cafes, shopping and attractions, all within walking distance. Our room faced Las Ramblas and suprising it wasn't too noisy. We enjoyed sitting on the balcony taking in the sights. I will definitely stay there on my return trip to Barcelona.",5,2014,11,29
60,Barcelona - Old Town,"The location was excellent. The most important places were at a walking distance. The metro station that takes you to historic places is two minutes walking distance. The hotel is very nice and clean and the staff is supportive.I think it is good value of money. 
Charter bus to the airport is only walking distance away from La Rambla.
 I would certainly recommend this hotel to family and friends”",4,2014,11,29

60,brilliant hotel and professional staff ,"we really enjoyed our stay at your hotel last weekend. we checked out on Tuesday, room 406. 

the hotel is in a perfect location, staff were helpful and friendly and rooms were always spotlessly cleaned. 

I would be definitely staying there when visiting Barcelona again and I'll make sure I'll let all my friends know about your hotel.

60,Excelent place to stay if you visit Barcelona for a few days.,"Nice clean rooms with good space. Perfect bathrooms with tub. A little bit of noise far La Rambla (nov. 2014) but okay. Location is central and perfect for walking around Raval, Gothic and Ribera area.",4,2014,11,25
60,Not for partygoers!,"Good location in the busy Las Ramblas! 
Clean hotel good service staff were helpful, good wifi service.
Plenty restaurants outside which were all great.
We played music one night and staff were quick to react and very seriously threatening with the police so wouldn't advise it for a night out - we apologised but and all was well after that, also they don't let anyone into the room that isn't booked in!
Late at night if your walking home watch out for prostitutes trying to steal from you!",3,2014,11,23
60,Barcelona Oriente Atiram Hotel - central  & comfortable,"Excellent location on the Rambla dels Caputxins, in lovely old modernised building close to Catalunya Square, metro and buses.  We asked for a quiet room and got one, clean with plenty of wardrobe space, also extra pillow arrived 5 mins after telephone request.  Air con., walk- in shower in large bathroom, clean towels every day and maid service.  Everything worked well.  Staff very pleasant and helpful, gave good advice about local restaurants.  The breakfast room is in a glass covered atrium with natural light, organised by a smiling waiter.  Linen table cloths and napkins. There are scrambled eggs and bacon, fruit,  ham and cheese, rolls &  pastries, tea, coffee and juice - all  to help yourself.  We found a high standard throughout the hotel.  No evening restaurant but there are restaurants all around the area, those on the Rambla are not particularly good, cheap but not good quality.  Try those in the old quarter opposite (e.g. ""La Fonda"",  ""15 Nits"" in Placa Reina).   ""Churros and chocolate""  are delicious, try them even if only once (doughnut  fingers to be dunked in melted chocolate, about 4 euros ).  Thoroughly enjoyable stay in a city full of interest.",4,2014,11,22
60,Very good location,"The hotel is located really in the very centre of the city. The hotel is on La Rambla and it is just 200 meters to the subway station, so that we were able to use the subway system in all our travel. The rooms were clean, and the breakfast was served above standards in a very good lounge illuminated by the sunlight. The staff was warm and helpful",4,2014,11,20
60,Character hotel on Ramblas,"informal atmosphere, very helpful and friendly staff.
Rooms clean and tidy, good facilities.
The hotel was obviously a grand kind of place in the past, and has been refurbished numerous times. The breakfast room retains some of the old grandeur and has been sensitively updated - great place for breakfast! Likewise staircase, corridors - nice.",4,2014,11,19
60,Superb location to see the city sights,"The hotel location is superb without the need for taxis, trains or buses to get you in and out of the city centre, it may seem a little expensive but you save on the transport costs. The rooms are great, full of charactor and the staff are first class. You need to be there!!",4,2014,11,19
60,Barcelona - Oriente Atiram et La Ramblas,"Barcelona is a magnificient city. I wish I had spent more time there.

We stayed at Oriente Atiram. The hotel is alright, it is clean and centrally located. There were rénovations being done to the facade of the hotel when we stayed there which caused some disturbances.

The breakfast is great.

The Ramblas is a very active area. People party until very early in the morning. We were not disturbed by that, as the windows were closed. We could not open them due to the repairs being performed.",4,2014,11,19
60,"very central in the city,","I styed 8 nights at this hotel. The rooms are fine and they have what you need, but not luxury in any way. The staff on the other hand was amazing. We used the reception as a turistguide desk more than a hoteldesk and they always had an extra advice that saved us alot of time waiting in ques for the attractions.",4,2014,11,17
60,Great Location within the city center.,"This particular hotel is well located within the city center, customer service was ok but the greatest, room was interesting. I am giving a 3 stars to this particular hotel because of its location, I just wish It had parking of its own.",3,2014,11,17
60,lovely hotel and so handy for everything,lovely hotel nice and clean and so handy for everything as you are right on the ramblas and a short walk to the port and to the hop on hop off bus.staff very helpful.we ate on the ramblas which was expensive on a couple of nights but then found a lovely family run restaurant on a side street which was reasonable.,4,2014,11,12
60,Great Hotel,"The hotel is located in a great part of town with lots of restaurants, shops and things to see.  The hotel's staff was friendly & helpful.  Most (if not everyone) speaks English and Spanish.  The rooms were spacious and comfortable.  Overall, I truly enjoyed my stay.",5,2014,11,12
60,Location and atmosphere,"The location is fantastic. Not only because it is on the Ramble, but is the very best part of the Rambla. And inside you have the most wonderful atmosphere. Though it is not the best hotel we have ever stayed at, the queality in general is high, at we have stayed at this hotel four times, and we will stay there again next time we are in Barcelona.",5,2014,11,12
60,Fabulous Barca!,"Stayed in this fabulous hotel on a recent four day break to this wonderful city. Great location half way down Las Ramblas. Very helpful staff. We paid slightly more for a deluxe room. Well worth it. Looked out on to Las Ramblas. Spacious air conned room. Free mini bar. Soft drinks.
Plenty of places to eat and drink within seconds of the hotel.Didn't have breakfast although it looked nice. We prefer to go out.
Easy transfer by bus from the airport. €5.90 to Plas Catalunya. Very short walk from there to hotel.
Metro very close by also.
In fact this hotel is within walking distance of all the main attractions even Sagrada Familia.
Would not hesitate to recommend this as a place to stay whilst visiting Barcelona.",5,2014,11,08
60,Unresponsive manager when an issue occurred - avoid the rooms ending in numbers 47!,"Great location for the price.The problem for me with this hotel is if an issue arises.
As a single person, travelling with a couple, I was allocated a very small room (although on advance booking had paid for a double at the same rate as my party). This in itself was unproblematic as the size was still acceptable, but the issue was that the room was next to the hotel's air conditioning system that was very noisy and constant. I only realised this issue when it came to settling in for the night, so went downstairs to see if a) they could get me some ear plugs or b) move me if possible. I was advised that the staff know this room is problematic but there were no spare rooms at all and ear plugs were available at the 24 hour pharmacy (resulting in a late night wandering up the Ramblas on my own, not wanting to disturb my fellow travellers). The next morning I asked if I could speak to the Manager as I wished to discuss some form of monetary refund for the inferior room. I was reassured they would change my room. I was advised I could have a free breakfast for myself. Being part of a party of three I did not wish to eat alone so said this was not appropriate and would like to discuss further with the Manager. I was told to wait for the Manager. After 15-20 minutes and a hold up in our days sightseeing around Barcelona, I decided to try to track the Manager down. I found her room and knocked on the door but she refused to see me, at all times the poor front desk staff had to respond on her behalf. I was told they would give me a better room/an upgrade but the room I received was exactly the same as my travelling party and probably what I should have been allocated in the first place. I again asked the Manager to consider a small refund and advised I would be back later/or discuss at check out. When this discussion happened again on check out I was abruptly told I had failed to wait to see the Manager (despite tracking her down and attempting to speak to her) and had refused her offer of breakfast, so that was the matter over with. Personally I find this unacceptable customer service and would expect a Manager to at least discuss this matter with me directly.",3,2014,11,06
60,"great location, very cheeky staff",The location is amazing. you are right on the Ramblas. Very close (hardly 2 mins) from liceu metro station that connects you further. also very close is the port. The only draw back is the staff which is very cheeky. DO NOT book taxis from here as got cheated in the process. Food around is expensive than the rest of the city.,3,2014,11,04
60,Great location but very basic ,"The hotel is right on La Rambla so you cannot get a more convenient location. The rooms were clean however the room that we stayed in was really small and very basic. We really felt the lack of a fridge as we couldn't even cool bottled water or soft drinks that we bought from the local supermarket, and the air conditioning didn't work very well at all. Overall, a very average hotel in a  sought after location.",3,2014,11,01
60,Brilliant central location,"One of the most central hotels - on Les Ramblas, close to some great places to eat, near the metro.  Really helpful staff and room very clean.  Had a room on the front - bit noisy, but part of the atmosphere of Barcelona.  Would recommend breakfast - great selection and only 9 euros if booked for each day of visit (otherwise 13 euros).  Would definitely stay again.  I agree the beds are a bit hard - but this is a personal thing.",4,2014,10,31
60,Great hotel for 3star,Ideally situated in the middle of La Ramblas. We stayed 4 nights Thursday till Monday and each night was a different price. We had a room at the back which was very quiet and very clean. The staff couldn't be faulted and didn't hesitate to recommend good restaurants. The place was buzzing and we have decided to go back in the Spring and will definitely stay at the Atrium. This should be a 4star !! One bit of advice the prices of alcohol are very expensive  so don't drink outside.,5,2014,10,31
60,gr8 location!,"Best location in barcelona.
very clean and nice staff.
the room was a bit noisy but we were so tired from traveling it didnt mind.
a bit expensive but thats 2 b expected on the Rambla

the staff helped us to get around and gave a map",4,2014,10,29
60,Pre cruise break,"Good location, nice room at front overlooking Ramblas. French doors kept out sound of night revellers. Staff helpful and attentive at all times. Only downside was the powdered scrambled egg at breakfast. Would happily stay here again.",4,2014,10,29
60,Location and service,"the hotel is well located in front La Rambla, the service of staff is excellent. room is clean including electric kettle, tea and coffee. room type Deluxe. it is very important to choose room type that will fit your expatiation. i order standard room in the back at first and when check in find room was more 2* hotel with old furniture etc.. but it is all up to the price.
Hotel is 2min from Palau Guel and 15 min from Picaso Museum.",5,2014,10,28
60,"Great Location, Better service","Perfect location on Las Ramblas, just 500 yards up from Colon monument. 15 euro taxi ride from airport. Had a room facing Las Ramblas but the double windows kept all the noise out and the cool AC in. Room and Hotel were clean, showers were hot, bed was comfortable (a little stiff for my preference but hardly intolerable), free wifi, elevators to all floors. The staff are all multi-lingual, helpful with directions and assistance, and truly did their collective best to solve any issue that came up-even allowing me to use a personal cellular phone to make a call to resolve a tour company issue! The staff is 5 stars! I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat.",4,2014,10,28
60,Great location; average value,"Hotel was otherwise very good, especially the location was absolutely perfect, but there was something wrong with the sewer system as it smelled in the room in daily basis. Because of the big renovation process in the city, the whole building was covered with tarp and we were not allowed to open the window to get rid of the smell. We complained about the matter, but it was not possible to change rooms so we had to settle for the visit of the cleaner every day as she was allowed to open the windows while cleaning. I suppose the problem had something to do with the renovation work, so I would not recommend the hotel until the renovation is finished.",3,2014,10,28
60,"Great Position, but...","Fantastic location in the heart of La Rambla. Nice big room, clean and bright. BUT very spartan - no tissues, no fridge, no tea or coffee making facilities, one very small cake of soap, a slippery shower in bath with no bath mat or rail to assist getting in or out, lack of power points (have to unplug TV to access one for chargers), no room service, poor check in due to insufficient staff, 2 puny prints on the wall. Beds are comfortable which I guess is the main thing and air-con works.
Wifi connection very poor.
Would I return? Doubtful, although the location would make it tempting.",3,2014,10,27
60,good value,"perfect position, good value, staff very helpful and friendly,we would definitely stay here again.good location for the placa  real good choice for eating ,as you walk into the square from the rambla go to the top left hand corner ,la quince nits you will not find a better menu or value for money anywhere you may have to queue for a short time but it is well worth it.",5,2014,10,24
60,Short break,"The reviews just before travelling were not very good, so we were plesantly surprised to find the hotel room was actually ok. We were given room at the front that we couldn't see out of due to the scafolding so that was not too good and they have no english speaking channels on the tv, so it was  no good other than for the radio.

On the positive, the breakfast was not too bad",3,2014,10,24
60,"Great location, good hotel!","We booked a five night stay at the Oriente Atiram, focusing mostly on location to have a good base to explore the city.  The location is perfect, just off La Ramblas, we could sit and watch the world go by from the balcony.  There were plenty of convenience  stores situated down the side streets within a minutes walk from the hotel.  It is also situated just a couple of minutes from the L3 metro stop towards the north and towards the south just minutes from a Bus Turistic stop (we bought 2 T-10 travel cards and 2 days each on the bus which was perfect for the time we were there!) The room was basic, but we knew that when booking.  The beds were comfortable, rooms were clean, air conditioning was fantastic and the shower was powerful and hot -just what you need to wash the city off you at the end of the day.  Despite the location of the hotel right on La Ramblas the double glazed balcony windows were quiet, I've stayed in much nosier city locations in the UK.  The only thing we really missed was a kettle and tea/coffee making facilities but saying that we avoided drinking the tap water and only purchased bottles of water from nearby shops and there's a Starbucks within minutes if you really need a cuppa!  Lastly,  the staff were great.  Always friendly and ready to help -my boyfriend became unwell quite suddenly and the night staff helped direct us to the nearest medical centre (which is only a 5 minute walk away...although in hindsight I'd always advise getting a cab at 4am rather than walking the backstreets lost!)  Thank you for making our stay enjoyable, hopefully we'll be back one day!",4,2014,10,24
60,"Nice location, not the best room","The hotel is located on the lower end of La Ramblas. This is a great starting point to explore Barcelona from. It's also just a few minutes from the L3 metro station.

Hopefully I got the worst room they got, and the rest of the hotel has a better standard. It was an internalfacing room with a double bed, a well used closet and a small bathroom. The bathroom suffered from waterdamage. The door had a gap on the bottom, so there was much noise from the outside. I only found one poweroutlet in the room, about 2 meters from the bed.

I did not get the chance to try the breakfast, as it was not included in my stay.
Note there's an oldfashion key on some of the rooms (mine included). You have to leave the key in the reception when you leave the hotel, and ask for it every time you get back..

The staff was pleasant, and everything looked tidy.

Also, right outside the hotel, several prostitute seemed to have it's workingplace...",2,2014,10,22
60,Nice hotel with perfect location,"We were in Barcelona for a long weekend in October 2014,  and had ordered rooms in the Oriente Atiram. The most important thing for us was to stay in the middle of town and having a hotelroom w / bathroom that was clean and decent. This we got. The breakfast was good and common area gave the impression of being a desent hotel. The only thing we missed was the duvet on the bed instead of sheets, and a door into the shower enclosure. The floor in the bathroom was quite wet after the shower, but with clean towels every day, it went fine. The staff was helpful and always greeted us with a smile. The hotel was a great base to explore Barcelona and we live there happily again:)",4,2014,10,20
60,Good location/staff -hotel,"Had an exciting room at the front of the hotel. I shared with my 2 adult children and we were very comfortable. Short bus ride from the beach! and metro right across the street!. Front desk was sooo accommodating, especially Daniel. Always ready to help.",5,2014,10,19
60,our school holiday trip,this hotel is situated on the Las Ramblas street in the heart of Barcelona we had a great time while we were there the only down side was that the hotel facade was being refurbished and we were unable to open our balcony window to enjoy fresh air otherwise the hotel was very good meals excellent and staff very friendly and accommodating nothing was too much trouble.,5,2014,10,18
60,Good location if your on a budget,"Great location, metro and many restruarants right outside the door so could not be better it that regard. This is a 3* hotel so not much in the way of facilities but that was not an issue.

The room seemed clean but very dated with furniture that had seen far better days. The beds were comftable through the pillows needed replacing.  Breakfast was included but not great by UK standards.

The one thing that would stop us staying here again is the noise outside the hotel ALL night long. I guess we could have asked for the room to be changed but never bothered though I wish we had of done.  If you want a cheap hotel in a good stop then this is for you, if your preference is a little more luxury then think again.",3,2014,10,17
60,Perfect location,"Cannot complain.. perfect location.. clean room and friendly staff.
We were there for just 2 days and being in the heart of Ramblas was a perfect choice. the location of the hotel made this short trip perfect. The staff is friendly; The breakfast was nice.. the room was clean and air conditioning was good.. For the price it was expensive but guess those extra owes to the location... :)",4,2014,10,13
60,Great location,"we choosed the hotel because of its location. As it was our first time in Barcelona and wanted to see as much as possble went for this very central hotel. Half way up/down the La Ramblas. Our room was clean, with everything that we needed for a 3 night sleep. Our room was on the back of the building so the noise from the La Ramblas didn't bothere us but could be a different story if the room was on the bussy La Ramblas. Breakfast was ok. Staff - friendly. Amazing food and flamenco show just 2 doors down: Tablao Flamenco Cordobes",4,2014,10,13
60,Great stay and excellent location,"Clean, friendly and amazing location in a  beautiful city! As I have read before on here the city view room can be a little noisy at times but what do you expect when you are located so central in the Ramblas.. Room cleaned Daily with coffee/tea replacement... For us it was perfect to get down and get around.. Cheers for a great break ",5,2014,10,10
60,right in the heart of las ramblas,I have just returned from a 1 night stay in Barcelona following a medeterian cruise. Staying in hotel oriented. 3 star hotel it is but 5 star staff. THe reception staff really couldn't do enough to make your stay any better.  The room itself was adequate on the small side. The bed was very hard. The view was of the back of the building facing us but it was quite. I would return again but I think they should update the beds.,3,2014,09,30
60,Terrible Hotel and Service,"The only thing good about this hotel is location!  Terrible service the staff was not helpful and was very nasty.  The rooms were small the room we got was old furniture and beds not like the picture on the web site, not sure were those pictures were taken!  But most of all the AC not functioning correctly and they control the temperatures and turn it up in the morning and at night was just cool air.  THey don't have ice available and when we ask for ice they gave us a small cup with few ices.  We had to go out to small market and buy a bag of ice!!!!",1,2014,09,30
60,Noisy,"Not a good place to stay. Terrible bed, not even a tissue in sight. Very noisy as sliding door is non sound proof. Seems as if it isn't even there. Reception is crazy loud music unprofessional staff.Although on La Ramblas you to make sure your room is on inner courtyard.",2,2014,09,29
60,Disappointing!,"First of all, I traveled in a group of 10 and we had arrived at this hotel after we stayed in Madrid, which we stayed in a hotel where our room was 5-stars in comparison.  We arrived on Sept 19, which this hotel was overbooked due to a local La Merce festival, so my friend and I were given an interior room (if not mistaken 220).  Let me say that we were stunned when we entered the room!  The room was small enough to fit 2 twin beds back to back, a 2'x2' night table and maybe a 2ft walking isle between the window and the beds.  There was no closet, no drawers for the clothes, no full size mirrors, walls dirty with people's hand marks, the beds had only a bed sheet and the lights were not enough to lit this room off it's depressive state.  This was the bare minimum that I dubbed it the ""nunnery room"".  I complained initially but was told that the hotel was booked and that's the best they could do.  I was frustrated but felt hopeless.  Two of our other friends showed us their room which was triple the size of ours and beautiful (not luxurious but nicely decorated); that's when i went to the reception directly to complain about our room once again and told them of how we paid the same price but yet we got a subpar room.  The lady that helped us was adamant in changing the room but I was persistent because I knew I was not going back to that depressive room.  She showed us a room (320) directly above the one we got assigned and this was triple as better - nicely decorated, slightly larger, closet with sliding doors with full size mirrors and compartments in the closet to put our clothes on.  We didn't hesitate in taking the new room but we just couldn't believe the deplorable service we had had so far!  The room was good but the bathroom had a standing shower stall with half a glass wall and the other half was open to the bathroom, which this allowed the water to spew over the floor and the toilet.  When you're done showering the floor is flooded that it didn't matter to have a throw towel on the floor because it was fully soaked.  We were completely disappointed and next time i visit Barcelona it will be at a BNB and not at a commercial hotel where one is not certain what type of room we'll receive.  

In terms of reception service, there was one particular person who was very polite (which is very rare in Barcelona) and helpful - Julio.  He worked the night shift and was helpful whenever i asked him information regarding my day trip to Monserrat, wines and airport transportation.",1,2014,09,29
60,Fab!,"We stayed at this hotel a fe weeks ago for a mid week break to Barcelona, there was 8 of us so 4 double rooms. We all said what a lovely stay we had! The staff were lovely and very accommodating. The location couldn't have been better, right in the middle of La Rambles, so very easy access to the sights and the restaurants, bars and shops etc. You couldn't ask for more from the rooms, very spacious, the bathrooms were big and there was a small balcony which was a bonus. Rooms were clean and well equipped. Would definitely use this hotel again, and I'm very confused at the other bad reviews I've read on here. The only niggle I have is that the hairdryer didn't work in our room, although my family's room was very close so I could run and use there's so wasn't an issue for me. Overall very impressed and would definitely recommend! ",5,2014,09,28
60,Fab location but check your choices in this big city before booking,"Being situated on the Ramblas was a perfect location for us as we wanted to be close to the Barrio Gothic area of Barcelona and this was also close to a metro stop. Great place to be in terms of restaurants and nightlife as spoilt for choice within easy walking distance.
Room was huge and clean and although in need of a refurb, it would have overlooked La Rambla if it hadn't been undergoing an external renovation as part of the government's commitment to retaining character and cleanliness. That didn't bother us but the noisy nightlife on the Friday night did! I'm usually a good sleeper but I could hear the party peeps heading home for the night through to 4am - grrr! OK other nights though. 
Desk staff are brilliant - great recommendations and very friendly, so ask them anything. 
We were happy staying here, but I have seen plenty of equivalent hotels in very good locations for less money, so my tip is to look around at your options before booking.",3,2014,09,27
60,Give this one a miss!,"Great location on Las Ramblas and the reception staff were extremely helpful, courteous and friendly but the hotel is soulless, shabby and run down. Heavy metal blasting through the communal areas at all times of the day and night does little to improve the atmosphere. Our room had a balcony, overlooking a side street, which was nice, and the double-glazing kept street noise out, but the room itself was extremely small and badly lit. The bed was not a full sized double and only had two small pillows - we did ask for more and eventually got them - and there was no fridge, table/desk or chairs. The bathroom was tiny and anyone over 1.90 metres will have difficulty sitting on the toilet. Shower pressure was ok but the shower base wasn't properly insulated so the bathroom got flooded. At breakfast the food was pretty average, international style buffet - no Spanish or Catalan specialities - and the coffee came from a drinks’ machine! There are much better places to stay in the area at much better prices. Avoid.",2,2014,09,24
60,Great location,"Hotel was right on  Las Ramblas  , being renovated on the outside and in in definite need of some inside too . Room was small but quite adequate , bed linen clean but so uncomfortable. Fridge didn't work and room needed a bit of decorating . 
Staff very friendly , breakfast was ok . Breakfast room very nice",3,2014,09,20
60,Avoid,"The rooms smelled, the beds were awful, very small bathrooms...we did not feel safe in or out of our room...free breakfast was horrible. Cruise line set up so do your homework don't depend on them!  Three men attempted to rob my husband in front of hotel.",1,2014,09,18
60,Great Location & Awesome Views,"Great little hotel central on La Ramblas with great views from balcony. Located between Plaça de Catalunya and Christobal Colom. Few minutes walk to La Boqueria, a large meat & vegetable market.

Within walking distance to everywhere. 

The room, for it's great views and super location, did not seem like a 3-star hotel to us. The room was ""dumpy."" The paint had large scratches from where furniture was dragged across the paint. The furniture was old and chipped. A coat of paint would have really made the room seem special, not just the view. 

We did not eat breakfast at the hotel, as it was 13 euro per person, but if you paid for all day's breakfast up front it was like 9 euro per day. There were too many other places to eat close by for cheaper.

Also, don't stick to Las Ramblas for food/drink. Go wandering and find a little square with some tables and have a real Barcelona experience. Also, the prices on La Ramblas can be pretty steep. One place, actually located right across from the hotel, charged us 45 EUro for 2 glasses of Sangria. We were foolish to not ask for a menu with prices (many have no prices), but don't make the mistake we did.

We took the hop-on-hop-off bus tour of the city which gives a nice overview of the city.

We traveled in September, which was brutally hot. The AC worked great and kept us chilly",4,2014,09,18
60,One night was enough....,"Great service from the staff. Very helpful and accommodating with early arrival. Don't expect to sleep much, too much noise!!! Currently renovating exterior which was not a problem. Great location near all the action.",3,2014,09,18
60,Hotel Oriente Barcelona,"Perfect location at the centre of La Rambla.  Very central for exploring the city.  Friendly and helpful staff, very clean accommodation.  Would definitely use hotel again because of it's location.  Ask for a quiet room top floor towards rear of hotel.",4,2014,09,16
60,Brilliant,"The hotel was brilliant and and in central location located in the Main Street la rambla, to say this was is the busiest street we got no noise on a night. Just down the street is metro and just a 5 minute walk to the beach. The rooms were clean however the shower was quite small. Also the was building work going on so there was scaffolding all around the building so you could not open the door and go on balcony.",5,2014,09,15
60,Avoid,"Sorry over-priced & poor standards.
It has a good location but you will find plenty of Pensions which are within 5 min walk that are smaller, cleaner & much better value.
One or two of the reception staff were very good.",2,2014,09,14
60,Excellent location if you dont mind so many tourists.,"Don't be disheartened by the scaffolding covering the hotel and other shops that the hotel is located.  Yes, there are building works taking place but there really was no impact whatsoever to our stay.  There is no impact to the internal areas and any noice was minimal.  The only thing you may need to be aware of is not to open your curtains till you are fully dressed!

The hotel is quite literally in the heart of tourist central!  It is possibly the busiest street I have ever walked on. 

We did give up on a slightly more plush hotel to be in the heart of La Ramblas.  The room was a bit basic   The rooms are reasonably spacious, huge clean and comfortable bed although you do get 1 painfully thin pillow which you need to double over to avoid getting a crick in your neck!), clean bathroom, not bad shower.    AC is available but not very powerful and is only the on or off type- not the type where you can set the temperature.  In room safe, hairdryer, although no iron/ironing board but laundry service available.

We didnt take breakfast option but it was available.  All hotel areas were clean and all staff very pleasant and helpful.  We requested and were provided a recommendation and directions to the best paella restaurant.  It was absolutely one of the best meals we have ever had.

You are 100 - 120 metres from the metro, very well worth buying tickets as this gets you everywhere- to all the main attractions.

Overall, hotel was good but basic but staff fabulous.  Excellent location if you dont mind the touristy thing, for us personally it was just a bit too busy and we would prefer to be in a plusher hotel in a less busier location.",4,2014,09,01
60,Perfect location for everything ,"This had been booked by our daughters and their husbands as a gift for our 30th wedding anniversary. It was the perfect gift... we had an amazing time! The hotel was on La Rambla... it was clean and the staff were wonderful. The continental breakfast was well stocked with cheeses etc. but it also hosted bacon, sausage and scrambled eggs. My only word of warning is that if you want an early night this is not the hotel for you. La Rambla goes to bed at 3am and wakes up again at 6am! ",4,2014,08,30
60,Perfect place to stay,"Fabulous hotel, full of history, comfortable and clean. Although on the Ramblas it felt quiet and safe once inside. Two double rooms with views over the street were ideal for adult couples. Great atmosphere and lots to see. Don't miss La Boqueria just up the road.",4,2014,08,27
60,"Great stay friendly, helpful staff.","We stayed at the Oriente because of it's location, but that's not all it has going for it.  The staff are friendly, relaxed and helpful.  We had a large double room that was clean and comfortable.  We only stayed for a 4 day city break and maybe if we had been there longer I might have found complaints like ""no view for us"" important, but Barcelona city is so vibrant and there is so much to do and see, that staying in our room was not at the top of our list. If you are looking for a hotel that is well located, clean, comfortable, reasonably priced with great staff then this is the perfect choice.",5,2014,08,27
60,"Great location, and good value","He chose this hotel for its location, which is great on La Rambla. Check in was very good and friendly. Our Receptionist was very well informed and gave great detail about the city and where to go eat that was not a tourist trap.
The hotel had building work on the facade, but we were staying on the other side, so no noise for us.
One thing that we did notice was how clean the hotel was, you could smell the cleanliness, the nice smell.
Rooms were very spacious, just our shower was leaking over the bathroom floor, even after it was mentioned, it was still not fixed.",3,2014,08,27
60,Would have been better - if it wasn't for the building work,"Had trouble finding the hotel at first , although on the Ramblas few people we asked had heard of it. Finally found it hidden behind a lot of scaffolding and netting. Check-in was hectic - and hot. When we got into our room we were very disappointed as not only did the scaffolding extend to the 4th floor - with a note saying we couldn't open the window onto a Julian balcony overlooking the Ramblas , but there were actually workers outside our bedroom windows. When we asked to move rooms we were told the hotel was full , so no joy , and no view for us. This spoilt what should have been a great location. Breakfast had a lot of variety , and set in a nice open atrium , but let down by some poor ingredients , powdered scrambled eggs and very artificial fruit juice. Maybe they should have cut down on a few of the cakes ? 
We loved Barcelona , but this hotel didn't really meet up to expectations.",3,2014,08,25
60,Comfortable and convenient,We stayed here primarily for its location and were pleasantly surprised by the friendly service upon check in. Nothing was too much effort. The rooms were spacious enough for 2 people and quite comfortable. Located right on la rambla and close to almost everything. I would recommend this hotel,4,2014,08,17
60,"Deceiving, deceitful and disappointing","10 years ago I went to Barcelona with my wife. I didn't know where we stayed but managed to track it down to the oriente hotel. So for our 10th wedding anniversary I booked the hotel as a surprise. Looking forward to a couple of days together. The main feature f this hotel is its location, I fact it's its only feature. So I booked a superior room overlooking les ramblas as we had when we first visited. I also sent the hotel an email emphasising this point and that it was our anniversary and how important it was. On arriving at the hotel I found the whole building covered in scaffolding and netting. I raised my disappointment with reception to get a shrug. The staff were obviously completely demoralised by the whole affair. I was then shown an alternative room half the size and looking onto an alley.  But told I would get a free breakfast which was worth 22 euros less than what I had spent on the room anyway? We left and spent an hour looking for another hotel, having not found anything we returned and accepted our scaffolding covered room. Once in we were told the windows had been sealed for our protection. The next morning we woke to workmen outside our window shouting and working, the following morning on opening the curtains a  gentleman was stood there taking off the shutters. The hotel knew the work was being done yet said nothing, they knew about my requests. Yet let me travel regardless and when they new about my disappointment they did nothing and did that with an air of ""your here now so there's  nothing you can do"" a shocking and shameful attitude.",1,2014,08,13
60,Superb location,Hotel was chosen for it's location and did not disappoint. Room was comfortable and with so much to do and see you are only in them to sleep. A little noisy at night but you know that will be the case when you book. Would certainly use again. Beautiful city,4,2014,08,12
60,superb city hotel,"for a city centre hotel with an excellent location, clean rooms, ample choice for breakfast look no further. our check in was a little slow but staff acted as quick as possible,  our room was on the front of the hotel overlooking the ramblas but noise levels were minimal.  front desk were very helpful in giving us tips and advice and our overall experience here was such we would not hesitate to come back or indeed recommend. well done and we hope to be back soon..",5,2014,08,12
60,Terrible ending to our Euro Trip,"My partner and I spent three weeks traveling Europe and our last stop over was in Barcelona. We booked into this hotel, as the location was on the La Rambla. But wow we where so disappointed by the first interaction with the staff at check-in. Our room felt empty and the beds were hard. The bedroom has no bar fridge The bathroom was bare. We felt so uncomfortable. The breakfast in the morning was average. The only highlight was the WIFI.",2,2014,08,12
60,Good location,"We chose this hotel for it's location. It is situated in the centre of the Ramblas, I noted many of the other hotels are situated towards the top of the Ramblas. Not only did we have the benefit of the central location it was right across from the Gothic Quarter. 

The strength of the hotel was its staff, who were friendly and inviting. The weak points were that the hotel was quite noisy and requires some modernisation when compared to the other similar hotels in the area.",4,2014,08,10
60,Excellent Location,Ideal hotel for being in the heart of La Rambla.staff very pleasant & helpfull.nothing was to much effort or trouble.Room was large and very clean.beds comfortable. plenty of hanging space.maid sevice very good .plenty of clean towels for everyone.Excellent location for transportation.sightseeing tour bus is a good way of seeing everything. can chose to hop on and off where you want to visit.lots of resturants to chose from whatever your taste.,4,2014,08,08
60,Excellent location,"Excellent location on La Rambla and very close to Liceu metro station. Efficient service with a smile by staff on reception at check in. We stayed in a room for 4 people and unlike many hotels where beds are crammed in there was plenty of space. Large bathroom with a good shower over the bath. Everything was very clean and the daily maid service was excellent in ensuring plenty of towels and toiletries in the room. There was good air conditioning and a digital safe in the room too. Firm but comfortable beds ensured a good night's sleep, and despite being on the 1st floor overlooking the very busy La Rambla there was very little noise, expect some rumblings from the metro, but not enough to disturb sleep. Check out was efficient & our request to leave luggage was accomodated. If being critical I would say it could use a lick of paint. Wouldn't hesitate to stay again.",5,2014,07,31
60,so so,"Right on the Ramblas, the hotel must be reputable to be sold out, no need to get a car, transportation is accessible and all kinds of places to eat, tapas and paella outside the door or KFC, BK and McDonalds available too. If you are a student some BK locations have a Euro king menu and the hotel is just a place to sleep. With all the traffic there it can get noisy but that is the Barcelona lifestyle",3,2014,07,26
60,Mastercard skimming/ copied at hotel,"The location is very good if you like to live i the middle of Ramblas (main street). There was some noise but less then I thought it would be. The rooms are clean and looks like in the pictures. 
Breakfast/brunch was bad, maybe because we were some of the last ones and came late. You should  either eat at some of the many resturants all over in the near area. 

So a big problem. My Visacard was copied at my hotell room. It was never used by me a our stay in Spain, and never left my bag. Not even shown to the reseption. It was a reserve card. So that leaves it to the cleaning staff. It was used online and paid for something using a PayPal  payment option. When I contacted PayPal they after 4 hours told me I would gett he money back, so a clear fraud. 
The Hotel refused  in a e-mail and tells me that all that staff are sertified and listen; “they have all worked there at least for 15 years”. Have any hotell a cleaning staff with minimum 15 years at the hotel? 
I got the hotel managers personal guarantee. Well that is not good enough. The card never left the room, they should investigate instead of refuse. 

The staff was elsewhere nice, as in the bar inside and next to reception who told me to go out to buy water because it costed 15 EUR inside. 
The hotell standard was ok+, but because of the issues above we had to close 2 other Visacard in case off abbuse. We do not know if they copied the info on all of them 
A lot of work in other words. 

Book another hotel.",1,2014,07,24
60,customer service needs upgrading,"We were booked at this hotel thru NCL and we stayed here pre departure July 12 then again as we got off the cruise July 20. On both times, the people in manning the front desk were non-cordial to say the least. We arrived early and had to have our bags on storage. As soon as our rooms were ready, we tried to get our luggage. Patricia opened the door to storage and directed us to retrieve our luggage under piles upon piles of other luggages! It is one thing that we have to carry our luggages to our rooms but to have to physically extract it from the storage room was almost mean. 
We reserved two rooms and no one told us how to work the phone. There was some code you needed to dial before the room number, and nobody bothered to tell us what it is. When we got there initially, we were given complimentary water, on our return after the cruise, they conveniently forgot. 
On the other hand, the rooms were big enough and clean. Breakfast was served in a nice area and food was okay. 
The location of this hotel suggests that this may be the only thing going for it, considering the bad customer service. It is located right at the heart of Ramblas, which is an interesting place. This will do as a transitory place but staying here longer will probably be not a good experience since noise level is kinda high. 
For those arriving earlier than check-in time, get some work-out now as you will be needing it to maneuver thru the storage room. Even if you are hanging around in the lobby waiting for your rooms to be ready, check on it yourself, because no one will bother to tell you that it's ready unless you ask them incessantly.",2,2014,07,22
60,Best accommodation for my entire Europe trip,"Great location easy to recognise from the outside as there were scaffolding. Did not affect the quality of the hotel at all. Friendly staff that are often so busy with customers checking in and out (popular hotel). Very reasonable price, great air conditioning. We had trouble logging into WiFi for the first night but once you logged in it was perfect. Daily room cleaning service and change of linen. Bit noisy at night from the noise from outside but understandable and quite interesting as we are right on the la rambla! Elevators for all the floors, they provided us with converter too with deposit. Will strongly recommended people to stay. ",5,2014,07,21
60,Great Location,"Spent four nights at the Oriente Atiram hotel in Barcelona.  A perfect location for access to LaRambla as well as the Gothic District.  Wonderful restaurants right outside the door.  Our room was in the back of the hotel, with a pretty awful view.  However, it was quiet and we appreciated that.  The room was small, but very adequate.  The staff was helpful in getting us a cab to return to the airport and with a wake up call at the appointed hour.  I would stay here again mostly because of the location.
The outside of the hotel is under renovation and completely covered w/ scaffolding - so hard to get a look at the exterior.  Didn't effect our stay at all.",4,2014,07,16
60,Great Location!,"We stayed at this hotel before and after our cruise as part of a package with NCL.  It does have a fabulous location, right in the middle of the Rambla. You just step out the door, and you are right in the middle of everything.  We arrived early from our flight, around 9am, so our room wasn't ready, but the hotel was able to hold our bags so we could walk around and get lunch and then check in.  The front desk staff was friendly and helpful, and the rooms were clean.  Our only complaint was that they need new pillows.  The ones they have were just not comfortable. The bus picking us up to take us and drop us off after the cruise was not able to park directly in front of the hotel, and we did have to walk a few blocks with our luggage to get to it.  It wasn't a problem for our family, but just something to know if you are considering this hotel.  Barcelona is a beautiful city, and being at this hotel put us right in the center of everything, so it was easy to walk to dinner, sights and shopping.",4,2014,07,11
60,Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!! So worth it 10/10!!!!,"I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone especially if you are a young group travelling with friends!! Barcelona is an incredible place and staying in this hotel was the cherry on top to the holiday.
The location is perfect, right on la ramblas and about a 30 minute walk to La Barceloneta. There are loads of shops, small markets and food places to discover and it is so helpful, especially at night, that the hotel is so close to a lot of the attractions. 

As soon as my girls and I arrived the staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. One of my friends had booked her holiday separately and was supposed to be staying at a different hotel but there was a trouble with her booking. We asked the staff at hotel oriente if they could put her up in our room but there was no space in the hotel for that night. However, she was able to stay in another hotel close by for the first night and the staff made sure that we were able to move into a bigger room where she would be able to stay with us for the duration of the holiday. 
If you stay here ask for Marco!! He's so helpful and was extremely helpful in trying to accommodate a bigger room for my friend to stay with us. He even gave us free passes to Shoko, a nightclub on la Barceloneta and recommended us good places to go on nights out on the town.

The rooms were really clean and the cleaning staff were lovely! We had a really nice view outside of our balcony of the side road. The bathroom was very clean and we had no problems whatsoever with our stay. The size of the room was perfect for the four of us as, there were 2 single beds and one double bed and we still had enough room for our suitcases and to move around. I've read other reviews about complaints about the noise on las ramblas and I don't think that it was bad at all. There is obviously a bit of wooping and stuff early hours of the morning but I didn't expect anything less staying in the centre. Don't listen to all of the bad reviews some people are just a bit miserable. 

Definitely if you choose to stay in Barcelona stay at Hotel Oriente!! It is so worth it!",5,2014,07,10
60,FANTASTIC HOTEL!!!!!,"Before travelling to Barcelona my friends and I had checked out reviews and pictures of the hotel and it is safe to say we were impressed. However, having stayed there for a week my expectations have been far surpassed due to the incredible customer service, cleanliness and location the hotel has to offer. 

When arriving in Barcelona we were having trouble with a friend's hotel, where she was unable to check in and thus didn't have a place to stay overnight - she had booked elsewhere. Being in a foreign country we were naturally worried about our situation, particularly as we were unfamiliar with the area. However, we were soon put at ease by the extremely helpful staff at hotel Oriente whom ensured our friend had somewhere safe to stay. Because there were no rooms available at that time in hotel Oriente, the staff went out of their way to help accommodate her elsewhere. Our friend was then moved in with us as soon as a big enough room was available. 

I couldn't have asked for better customer service at the hotel. Every member of staff was welcoming each and every time we entered the hotel and were never hesitant to give us directions or suggest places to go to - as first timers in the city. What particularly stood out during our stay was the customer service offered by a particular member of staff - MARCO! From the moment we arrived at the hotel to the moment we left he had a smile on his face and was always happy to help. One day we brought watermelon back to the hotel having overestimated the amount we could actually eat and he offered to put it in the fridge for us - as our room didn't have one. We were meant to go and collect it after 15 minutes but this completely slipped our mind. Nonetheless, 15 minutes after leaving the watermelon with Marco he was at our door with 4 plates, cutlery and the watermelon!!! 

Another impressive aspect of our stay was the cleanliness of the hotel. Whenever we arrived back at our room after a day out our beds were made, the floor was cleaned and the bathroom was spotless. We were also given fresh towels whenever we needed them, as well as a fresh shower mat and flannels. Moreover, the cleaners were very friendly and always said hello when passing by. 

Lastly the location of the hotel couldn't have been better. Being located in the centre of Las Ramblas we were in walking distance of numerous shops, bars and restaurants, as well as being a 30 minute walk from La Barceloneta (a lively beach with plenty of cafes, bars and clubs). Having heard about the liveliness of Las Ramblas I expected to hear a lot of noise from our room, but this was not the case. Although there was the odd strange noise from a bunch of tourists, there was nothing major enough to disturb a good night's sleep. 

Oh and finally I just want to thank the hotel for the amount of complementary marshmallows I managed in devour whilst staying there... and the sweet bananas, gummy bears and lollipops!",5,2014,07,10
60,AMAZINGGG!!! 10/10!!!,"Barcelona in general is a fantastic place to visit, but everything about the hotel made our stay absolutely amazing!

Firstly the location couldn't have been more perfect, Hotel Oriente is right on Las Ramblas and is of walking distance from both La Barceloneta (the beach) and Catalonia square. 
There is something for everyone, a couple of museums are close by, there are also a large number of cafes, bars and restaurants surrounding the hotel, and it is about a 20 minute walk from a number of well known clubs too (e.g. Opium, Catwalk and Shoko).

Secondly all the staff are so friendly and helpful (especially Marco!!!)... We arrived at around 2am due to flight delays and he was extremely welcoming, he gave us free bottles of water and sweets and even directed us to our friends hotel as she was staying somewhere different.
The next morning he even went out of his way to try and find out if there was a 4 person room available and him and the rest of the staff allowed her to stay with us for the remainder of our holiday.
Staff always directed us to exactly where we wanted to go and gave us maps with the directions written down each and every time! Marco even gave us free passes to the local clubs and recommended an amazing shisha lounge (Jerusalem Lounge) that was close by.
The hotel also offers the Barcelona bus tour at a discounted price and the lobby has many leaflets that tell you about other main attractions in Barcelona.

The hotel was always kept clean and tidy, we always got fresh towels and whenever we came home the beds were made and the air conditioning was on. There were also little messages left on our mirrors saying welcome and hola which we thought was so cute!",5,2014,07,09
60,Great central location on La Ramblas,"This hotel was perfect for one evening because its is in prime location on La Ramblas street. The hotel itself was simple and old but clean. Nothing to rave about in the rooms. Free tradition meat, cheese and pasterie breakfast in the morning. Great shower pressure, small elevators. ",3,2014,07,09
60,Good for Barcelona First-Timers,"Stayed here June 2014. Weather was pretty perfect, save for a few rainy patches. The hotel is in the situated right on Las Ramblas and about 300-400 from La Boqueria if crazy good food markets are your thing. Room is clean and as others have noted, basic (for a fair price). The staff were very accommodating with requests for extras like pillows and a kettle. Good location for first timers and if you'll only be in Barcelona for a few days as it's near the major tourist/sight seeing attractions. I like the activity of Las Ramblas, but it can get rowdy until very early into the morning.",3,2014,07,07
60,Right in the heart of Las Ramblas,"Most of the staff are friendly with one employee going out of his way and apologizing for some rain we had.  The rooms are pretty basic, but much larger than what I'm used to for a European hotel.  I was on the 3rd floor and because it was World Cup, it got quite rowdy at night.  My room didn't face Las Ramblas, but I still got woken up at night with World Cup revelers and various drunks singing and screaming.  The free wifi was spotty and weak with frequent disconnections.  When you leave the hotel you leave your key at the desk.  Then when you come back you tell them your room number and they give you your key.",4,2014,07,05
60,Not very accomodating to jet lag,"Check-in time is 2 pm.  And the desk staff was not understanding of the difficulty.  2pm does not mean 1:59 pm.   The problem is that flights from the US arrive 10 am.  And after not sleeping all night, this is not accommodating to American travelers.

This hotel advertises that it has air conditioning.  I don't feel any air conditioning in my room.  

This hotel also advertises breakfast to 11 am.  Getting there at 10:58 after a surly waiter already put the ribbon across was not accommodating jet lagged travelers either.  He was clearly upset when I entered anyway.

I would not come here again.",2,2014,07,05
60,3 Nights Stay,"The hotel is in an excellent location and most of the staff is very friendly and helpful.( except for one particular girl in reception). This is the ONLY thing this hotel has going for it. We had booked a Ramblas view room ( not Deluxe) months ago and later found out about the scaffolding and balcony being closed off.I emailed the hotel and the only thing they offered was another balcony room facing a different street. I mentioned that I had payed more for that room for the views but no other compensation was offered, I feel they should have upgraded me. The room was horrible!
It was tiny and the only window it had was the balcony that was closed off and had a giant tarp/sign covering it.It had no drawers to store anything, just some cubby hole type night tables.There was a nasty sewer type smell everytime we came in to the room that I think was coming from the bathroom which was pretty bad too ( just a sink with no counter top) The room reminded me of a college dorm or cheap motel,lol. I would definitely not stay there again! Maybe if I had a Deluxe room it would have been better? I think all the rooms should be adequate regardless and this one was NOT. There were also some service/request issues that were not handled in the proper way but I wont get into that.",2,2014,06,28
60,Barcelona City Break,"The hotel is clean and the staff are friendly. The rooms are a good size and the shower room was fine (apart from the blocked plug hole!) Would be nice to have a kettle in the room to make a brew after a days trekking around the city but I was very impressed with the breakfast, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and beans followed by a cheese and ham croissant washed down with a few cappuccinos and finally grabbing some fruit on the way out! If we visit Barcelona again we will probably get a Hotel closer to the beach because it probably takes about 35 minutes to walk to the beach which is harder than it sounds in flip flops and 30 degrees! Overall I would say we were very pleased with the hotel, no complaints. A/C was efficient and quiet.",4,2014,06,26
60,50th Birthday Trip,"Oriente Atiram Hotel suited our needs perfectly. My husband and I enjoyed the location and proximity to sites, tourist bus, Metro stops, etc. we basically walked everywhere. The men at the front desk are exceptionally friendly and helpful.  We asked so many questions throughout our stay, and they went out of their way to help us, especially Igenió and Fernand. The ladies, not so friendly, but polite.  We traveled from NY and arrived early.   We immediately checked in, and were able to relax and freshen up. The room size was adequate and very clean.  We ate breakfast one morning and it was ok, however, there are plenty of places to eat - check out The Boqueria if you enjoy fruit. The housekeeper on our floor was truly friendly and polite.  I recommend this hotel and it's super friendly (male) front desk staff!",4,2014,06,24
60,Barcelona Holiday,"I went for 2 weeks on a bed and breakfast basis which suited me fine as I spent the days site seeing. The hotel was perfectly situated with close access to the metro and restaurants as well as main tourist area of ""Las Ramblas""  As the hotel is on La Rambla all rooms facing the street are a bit noisy but one can always ask for a room at the back (if you want a peaceful sleep). The staff are very friendly and helpful. The room (after moving to the back) was perfect. Would gladly recommend this hotel. ",4,2014,06,23
60,Barcelona Break In The Heart of La Rambla,"The Hotel Oriente is located on La Rambla, 2/3 minutes walk to the nearest tube station, their is scaffolding on the front of the building as there are some ongoing renovations, but we never heard any workmen making noise or racket (it actually helped us locate the building at night so not always a bad thing!)  The receptionist was very friendly (as were all the staff in our experience) the room was in the 'old' part of the building (the hotel has been extended over the years), It had a large comfortable bed, plenty of hanging space and cupboards, the room also had a safe in one of the cupboards, small bathroom but perfectly adequate.  The room also had some wonderful antique furniture, sliding doors with a little balcony, our room was as the left hand side of the building (room 229), it was facing an office block but you heard very little noise from the La Rambla during the evening and night (we spent very little time in our room anyway so again this wasn't a downside) 

The room had blackout curtains and a net curtain, the bed had 2 sheets and a blanket (perfect for the time of year, mid June), clean towels, fresh toiletries and bed made/changed on a daily basis,  You can also leave your keep with the reception when you go out and about and collect it when you get back (again the staff were more than happy with this) 

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking to stay somewhere central at a reasonable price for a busy area.

Don't let the scaffolding put you off this hotel is over 150 years old and it's nice to see that it is being well maintained and updated",4,2014,06,20
60,Terrible,"Staff is very rude. They barely answer your basic questions. Toilets smell like ****, dirt all over a pillow. You hear people in the rooms close to you. We reserved a queen bed, we got two simple beds joined but seperated by a 20 cm empty space. Staff is really rude, especially the girls there. Metro passes every 30 min down so you feel the building moving. Well located but realllllly not worth it, I'd rather pay double and go to a place where the staff will treat me as a human being.",2,2014,06,18
60,Bargain hotel with great location,"Oriente Atiram is a clean, comfortable ""no frills hotel"" located in the heart of las ramblas in Barcelona. We spent 4 nights there in May. The location is on las ramblas, giving you access to the ""action"" per se. The front of the hotel has scaffolding but insides were well maintained. Some of the rooms are big while some are small (ours was big with three beds while our friends had a small room, even though we paid the same prices). Rooms are in general clean, comfortable and unfussy. Bathroom was very big by European standards. Hotel staff are friendly and helpful. They provided a travel charger, directions etc when we needed. The beds are somewhat firm but it worked fine for us.This is not a luxurious hotel by any means but is steps away from metro station and all the fun Las Ramblas has to offer.",4,2014,06,17
60,"Good location, no frills","Well... it was a short stay in Barcelona in a suitably placed, no frills hotel. I wasn't looking for luxury and three-course banquets, just a decent enough place to bed down at night ready for my next day filled with excursions and sightseeing. Sure, there was scaffolding out front, so what? You can't make omelettes without breaking eggs! How else is an establishment meant to effect repairs without a little dust! 
Our room was cosy enough with adequate storage and a safe for valuables. It was cleaned daily and a good night's sleep was had each night. The shower screen didn't help too much in preventing water getting onto the floor but this was no big issue. 
The buffet-style breakfast was adequate for a morning since we fully intended eating outdoors all the time. The famous Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria was ideally nearby for a snack or even a meal if you were prepared to wait.

The hotel receptionists were quite friendly and helpful with a very good command of english language. 
All in all, nothing really bothersome to complain about and a pleasant stay was had, Thank you to all representatives of Oriente Atiram, Rambla, Barcelona.",3,2014,06,17
60,Great Location!,"Great Location! Our room was right on the Las Ramblas and had 2 balconys so we could open them up and take it all in from our room. The room was so so but since we were only in our room while we were sleeping it was great. It has a good bathroom, beds were comfy, but location doesn't get better then this. Picasso's Museum is right down the street. I would recommend doing the bus tour and that is right down the street as well. Overall, I would Recommend this hotel for your visit. For the price and everything listed above it can't be beat!",4,2014,06,17
60,not recommeted !!,"Not recommended! 
The hotel is being renovated, all its front is covered and closed. 
We arrived on Thursday evening, we received a poor room without a window, a bathroom is not sealed 
The next day we changed rooms but the rooms are very noisy, uncomfortable mattresses, pillows narrow and thin and not comfortable and there were no extra pillows. 
The only thing this hotel its location which is very convenient. 
The service is polite but not very helpful in some cases. 
Very disappointing.",2,2014,06,16
60,Very nice,"The hotel has a great location, right in the middel of the Ramblas, and near a metro station. Our room was average but very clean. The guy in the reception was very nice and helpful, the lady who stood there at night didn't know english very well. Brakefast is standart. To sum up, great place to put your head at night, in very good price and excellent location.",4,2014,06,14
60,Very Poor for the money,"This hotel is located on the Ramblas and is priced accordingly ( I paid 190 Euros Room Only).

I arrived at reception and was ignored for a good few minutes while the receptionist answered the hotel phone and then her own mobile phone while some quite load rock music played on her computer.

My room was tiny and to be honest although clean enough, needed a good coat of paint, also the window was locked shut and could not be opened and the mixer tap in the bathroom did not work properly so if you wanted a wash you had to have a bath as the water would not divert to the shower head.

All the above you can forgive, I travel a lot and none of this is particularly unusual in busy high throughput hotels. However the biggest problem with this hotel is the subway. In my room on the first floor I was awoken every 45 minutes by the whole room shaking every time a subway train passed underneath. After a terrible nights sleep I went for breakfast which at 13 Euros was possibly the worst I have had for some years,  powdery watery scrambled egg, coffee from a machine that was truly awful and the supermarkets cheapest cuts of ham and plastic cheese. Accompanied by a soundtrack of drum and bass which was the last thing I wanted to hear after a night of subway trains. If you are unfortunate enough to stay here don't bother with the breakfast.

After one night I checked out and got a room at the Majestic up the road which was only 50 Euros a night more but is in a different class to this dump. 

As an aside to this review I was amazed to see a lady recently give this hotel 3 stars despite the fact she had valuables stolen from her room, allegedly by the cleaning staff. Some people are obviously far more forgiving than me.",2,2014,06,14
60,"""Almost a week in Barcelona""","Nice Hotel, excellent location and very efficient and friendly staff. Good basic breakfast. Good hotel for three star. Located on Las Ramblas. It not cheaper the price is something Spence. Clean and the attention is good. I recommended this hotel in Barcelona.",4,2014,06,06
60,BEWARE! Don't leave valuables out!,"At first this seemed like a too-good-to-be-true hotel. Perfectly located for sight-seeing and very well-kept and spacious inside. Staff were friendly and helpful and it was very good value for money. 

Unfortunately, soon into my stay I accidentally left a ring by the bathroom sink when washing my hands. On returning to the freshly cleaned room a few hours later, I noticed it had gone missing. It can't have fallen down the plughole, as the staff insinuated, as the drain holes were far too small. After a thorough and repeated search, I feel it can only have been stolen from a member of the cleaning staff which is extremely upsetting. I appreciate it was my fault for leaving it out but I shouldn't have to appreciate it being stolen as a result. It was of great sentimental value and put a dampener of the remainder of my trip in Barcelona. BEWARE.",3,2014,06,06
60,A basic hotel in a great location and at a fail price,"Located on Las Ramblas opposite to the entrance to the Royal Plaza, this hotel is in a 100+ year-old building which is currently undergoing a facelift (hence the scaffolding) which means that rooms in the front have essentially no view. We found that our Ramblas-fronting room was quiet and, while quite basic, to be fully adequate. We note that while breakfast was on offer when we reserved for 13.5 euro per person, when we registered, they offered a rate of 9 euros per person as long as you booked breakfast for your entire stay, 

You could not ask for a better location. Front desk staff was always helpful. We would certainly book here again.",4,2014,06,02
60,Long weekend break,"Fab hotel. Friendly staff. Bedroom clean and comfy bed. Need new pillows!!!!

Location very central. 

Be aware that the bar restaurant connected to the hotel is very expensive. It cost us nearly 20 euros for 2 sangrias!!!!

Just be on the look out for pickpockets on las ramblas. 
Had a lovely time and Gaudi's architecture was awesome!!!",4,2014,06,02
60,A week in barcelona,"Very efficient staff, very clean, excellent location.
Very Basic breakfast
Would of liked option to hire fridge for room as walking holiday and chilłed drinks required.
Good hotel for 3star would stay again

      
      ",4,2014,06,01
60,Fantastic !,"Fantastic hotel , friendly helpful staff and great location , we stayed for 3 nights and had the best time what an amazing city can't wait to return. Don't listen to the negative comments ! The rooms we're clean yeah we didn't have the best view but I didn't go to sit in my room , only negative I could possibly say is the pillows were rubbish flat and uncomfortable but after a few jugs of sangria who cares ! Would defiantly stay here again .",5,2014,06,01
60,Excellent location and good value for money,"My friends and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and found it to be just what we needed: good location, clean rooms and friendly helpful staff. There were 4 of us in one room, so had one double bed and one sofa bed. More importantly, as we were all girls, there were 5 mirrors and enough space for us to not be on top of each other! Location wise there is easy access to restaurants, taxis and the metro. We only used taxis at night and explored by foot during the day, the gothic quarter is about 15 mins walk away. We also discovered a lovely little square opposite the hotel and dined on some good food there. All in all a great stay!",4,2014,05,30
60,Good hotel for city traveling,"very good location on La Rambla street.  low quality amenities, medium quality breakfast.
The service is medium (forgot to put soap in two days).  The front of the hotel is under reconstruction.  our room window was to a back building",3,2014,05,29
60,Perfect city break,"My friend and I  (29 & 44) had a girlie bank holiday city break in Barcelona in May. Neither of us had been before so we took our info from Trip Advisor do I feel I must return the favour.  The hotel is right in the middle of La Ramblas. WHAT A WONDERFUL AVENUE. It is a beautiful tree lined pavement with cafe bars and little craft stalls and tacky souvenir stalls. It's beautiful and historical looking and lively and bustling from breakfast to the middle of the night. Huge 1 litre jugs if gorgeous Sangria only €6. You can sit and people watch for hours while you drink it, very good value for money. Avoid sangria in Place Riel across the road, 1 vodka/coke €8 and sangria tasted of after shave. You MUST visit Place Riel though, beautiful restaurants fantastic people watching and architecture. In fact our day time snacks and drinks were on La Ramblas and our nights around Place Riel. 
The hotel......unfortunately there is major exterior works bring carried out and the whole building is swathed in scaffolding. Not to bad you think, you can't see it once you're inside, but unfortunately all the balcony door handles have been removed do you can't enjoy fresh air or the views. Very hot rooms when 2 women are showering and hair drying.
The breakfast was well worth pre-booking, plenty if choice and a lovely light atrium. 
Overall, clean, friendly, excellent location, cheap and helpful. I will definately be coming back to Barcelona and definately  be returning to this hotel. 
You MUST also check out Runner Beans Free walking tours. They go twice every day 11 and 4 from Place Riel and you can book a place by Googling them or just turn up in the square. The guides are awesome and they take you around the sight if Barcelona and their knowledge is amazing.",4,2014,05,28
60,Best location,"Perfect location on La Ramblas, everything in walking distance..short walk on La Ramblas to the metro. Close to main town squares and I recommend going to the markets  ( entrance off La Ramblas)... Fresh juice and fresh fruit cups for £1....
The hotel is clean and the front desk staff were very helpful with directions and suggestions..
I will definitely stay again.",5,2014,05,28
60,Great Location,"Located on La Rambla in the heart of the action. Convenient and close to Plaza Reial with lots of bars and restaurants. Clean and tidy rooms but needs sound proofing from the noise outside! Staff were great, cheery and welcoming. The breakfasts offered great value and are recommended. If convenient location is what you are looking for, look no further.",4,2014,05,27
60,Good stop for the night,"Booked this hotel through NCL for one night pre-cruise. Hotel staff very efficient and organized when checking in. Room small compared to north american standards but about the same size as an NYC hotel room but very clean and fresh, not smoky at all. Location is excellent, right in the heart of all the action. Asked for ice and extra towels, staff helped immediately. No complaints at all. VERY quiet actually if you have a room facing in the courtyard, which looks down into the atrium dining room.",3,2014,05,24
60,Fantastic city break.,"The wife and myself booked into the Oriente for four nights from March 16th-20th and I have to say that we should have booked a longer stay. There is so much to do and see that four days is simply not long enough. 
The hotel itself is clean, ideally located on the bustling Las Ramblas and the staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are spacious and clean.
We opted out of the ' in hotel ' breakfast as we wanted to sample the delights of the local cafés instead.
During the day we went for long walks, visited the zoo and went on an open top bus tour which takes in every attraction of the city ( tickets can be purchased from a shop beneath the monument at the bottom of las Ramblas ).
Most evenings were spent in the Gothic quarter of the city which boasts architecture that will leave you mesmerised and bars that are unspoilt and if I dare say a lot cheaper than those on Las Ramblas.
Pickpockets are about and tried it on but a quick shove into a scaffolding bar sorted that one out. My advice is always be alert, split yr money into separate pockets and for ladies try to walk with your bag to the front of you rather than the side.
Don't let that put you off tho. This City will welcome you with open arms and leave you planning your next visit before you have set off on the journey home. 
Thank you to the staff and apologies to the manager for walking straight into what looked like the shooting of a promotional video.
We will be back!",5,2014,05,21
60,Wonderful location,Visited this hotel with my husband for 4 nights for our first year wedding aniversary. Hotel is in an excellent location and is clean n spacious. The rooms are a little dated but it was excellent value for money..breakfast was ok but sometimes its good to explore other options. I would definately visit this.hotel again.,4,2014,05,18
60,Double booked our accessible room. Disabled unfriendly.,"I booked a disabled room for 4 nights. I phoned the hotel before booking to make sure all the facilities were suitable for my husband who uses a wheelchair full time. I was assured that the room/facilities were suitable and received an email confirming my phone call. 
I also booked and paid for a standard room.

On arrival we were shown to 2 standard rooms. Our 'disabled room' was double booked. 
We wasted the whole of our 1st afternoon and morning of day 2 in Barcelona waiting while the asst manager Cesar Fuster phoned around hotels trying to find a suitable room for the 2 nights that our disabled room was double booked. 

After a very difficult night in the standard room where my husband could not use the shower which was over a bath, and using the toilet was difficult and dangerous, we were moved to another hotel for the 2nd night.

We then wasted more time moving from the other hotel back to Oriente on day 3. This was all very difficult for a wheelchair user who has paralysed legs.
The shower at 2nd hotel was not suitable as there were no safety handrails in the shower. 

Day 3 we moved to what was supposed to be a disabled room. There were safety rails alongside the toilet but the shower was a standard shower with no support rails. There was a metal bar around the sink at knee height. 
The receptionist brought up a chair from the hotel bar so my husband could finally have a shower with my assistance. 

The breakfast room had 5 steps so we were put in an adjoining room which on day 4 we had to share with a 'kid's club'.

This was very disappointing and annoying after the trouble I went to to carefully check the facilities before our journey. We were put into 3 different rooms in 2 different hotels during our 4 night stay.",2,2014,05,17
60,Five Nights in Barcelona,"We chose this hotel because it was high up on the list presented to us by Expedia of hotels in the Barri Gotic and if we were going again it would be the one to choose without hesitation as we had a most memorable stay. Our arrival was hectic as I had just discovered that my wallet had been stolen moments before as we emerged from the (thankfully) almost adjacent metro station. The reception staff were extremely helpful and were able to direct us to the local police station to report the incident. (Tip: Train and Metro not advisable if you have much baggage.)
The room was extremely well presented, clean and well-maintained throughout our visit and was a perfect safe haven after our hectic dashes around Barcelona during the day. Although fronting onto La Rambla which seems busy during much of the day and night it was also very quiet. Great to see that restoration of the frontage is on-going with workmen around at various times of day. A kettle and tea/coffee facilities would be helpful but these with other beverages were available in reception. 
Throughout our stay the staff on reception were exceedingly friendly and helpful, booking and printing tickets for several outings and suggesting possible places to visit. One, Pedro, even lent us his own books on Le Palau de la Musica Catalana to peruse before our visit there.
Breakfast was a time to reflect and collect our thoughts before the day's activity and where could be more pleasant than the atrium with a good selection on offer; unlimited coffee and juice and a good selection of hot and cold items including fruit, cereals and bacon were on display and were frequently topped-up. The staff here were also friendly and helpful, maintaining a good standard of cleanliness and ensuring a good flow of diners without any pressure on other customers.
The Hotel's location on La Rambla and its proximity to Liceu Metro station makes it a great place to be for the major attractions which, in Barcelona, seem almost too numerous to list (La Boqueria, Gaudi, Picasso, Montjuic,The Barri Gotic Roman remains and the port amongst many others.) 
Overall this was a great choice of accommodation for what was a spur-of-the-moment trip, straight-forward room and good service in a good location.",5,2014,05,16
60,Brilliant location for city break,"Fantastic location for a city break, right on La Ramblas in the midst of it all.
After reading the reviews I requested a room at the front with a balcony for a 3 night break for myself and 20yr old daughter.  We'd have preferred to be able to see and hear the hustle and bustle and wouldn't have been bothered by the noise. Upon arrival it was disappointing to see the hotel covered by scaffolding and were told that none of the balconies at the front could be opened so requested an alternative room. The first option given was not at all what I expected, very small, tiny window and tiny bathroom but was really happy with the second offer (it was worth complaining about the first option!). The room we ended up in was on the side of the hotel on the second floor with one of the small wrought iron balconies. Couldn't see much of the main street but it was lovely to be able to open the doors.  The staff were pleasant, room was a bit dated but clean, beds lovely and comfortable (two doubles in our room). Bathroom was spotless with plenty of towels. Really can't fault the hotel and would definately return.",4,2014,05,16
60,Lovely short break,"Stayed at the Oriente for four nights last week and couldn't find fault with this hotel. Location was absolutely perfect for exploring Barcelona (metro station pretty much outside the hotel - Liceu). Room was fairly basic, but very clean. Staff were polite and helpfull. We booked through easyjet, so breakfast was included in the price - the pastries were soooo good!
Would definately stay again, had a great time!",4,2014,05,13
60,Right in the centre,"Stayed 5 nights. Room fair - not very large but comfortable - bathroom door wouln't close, balcony closed off due to scaffolding. Reasonably clean. Breakfast very average - 9E per person per day. Possibly do better in the cafes a few minutes walk to the south, away from La Rambla eg behind the market.No kettle etc provided in room - took our own. Desk helpful. Didn't spend a lot of time at the hotel - too busy out and about. Very convenient for the central area - walking distance of cathedral, Picasso museum, cathedral and waterfront. Metro station close by, trains very frequent but sometimes crowded. Didn't bother with one of the various travel passes, fare was E2.40 single anywhere on the system. Long walks at some of the interchanges. .",3,2014,05,07
60,A Bargain,"This hotel has very average accommodations, but the price is right and the location is terrific. We signed up for room and breakfast, and that turned out to be a good and economical choice. With a little more work (such as a luggage rack), the rooms would actually be very adequate. There are safes in the room, and the hotel provides free wi-fi. The staff was very attentive, readily available, and very helpful. We subsequently stayed in other hotels in Barcelona, and although the accommodations were better, the service could not compare and the price was a poor value compared to the Oriente.",4,2014,05,01
60,50th Birthday Party.,"Stayed at the Husa Oriente on the 25th of April for 3 nights. Hotel is a basic 3 star, £30 a night. Depending on who is on the reception is how quickly you will be seen to. Never had breafast as it was 13 euros. Go to Dunnes irish bar. Full english breafast toast and tea for around 10 euros. Location of the Hotel is bang in the middle of The Ramblas. Out of hotel, turn left and go 200 yds up the road and you have Licie underground which takes you to Sagrada Familia or the Camp Nou for 2 euros return. out of the hotel, turning right and brings you down to the harbour in 15 mins. Would stay again here as it a great base to move around everywhere. Be weary of the the pickpockets and the ladies of the night as they come out at night and can be tiresome. Told to keep everything in front pockets and very true that was. Barcelona is a great city.",4,2014,04,30
60,"Great location, close to everything","My daughter and I had a recent four day stay at this hotel.  Location is great.  Literally 100 meters from a metro station and so easy to walk thru the gothic area and down to the beach.  We had a smallish room on the 1st floor facing La Ramblas.  The hotel is doing necessary facade renovations so our windows did not open which was fine.  The street was super noisy all night, but the hotel does tell you about this on their web site.  People are partying all night in this city.   My only small issue was the location of our room.  Is was adjacent to the breakfast restaurant and with marble floors, it was very noisy outside our door in the mornings.  Perhaps avoid the first floor when booking a room.   Also, the wifi which is free was seriously dodgy when we were there.  Constantly logging in again time and time over.",4,2014,04,28
60,Overbooked and Not Bothered,"I booked this hotel in December last year through Low Cost Holidays and received a confirmation of the booking and the hotel voucher was emailed to me in March. When we arrived at the hotel on Friday we were told that there was an overbooking that our agents were responsible for, and there was no alternative but to get a taxi to another hotel on the outskirts of Barcelona. 

This would have been bad enough had it not been for the rudeness of the staff on the reception who couldn't have been less interested if they tried. The fact that the front of the hotel was covered in scaffolding was almost lost on us at this time.

On Saturday morning the 19th April we dutifully returned as instructed to the Oriente where we were told that there was still no room available, and we were then told to come back in the afternoon. We were allowed to leave our luggage, but obviously all our valuables I had to carry with me all day on Saturday. When we eventually did check in we were allocated a room on the 4th floor with a lovely view of the scaffolding, but this time from the inside of the hotel.

My wife rang the reception and asked for 2 extra pillows and was told that there are no extra pillows by the receptionist. She then went out into the hall where the cleaners were working and asked them, and was given 2 extra pillows straight away.

The beds are uncomfortable as the mattresses are too hard, and the air con didn't work. Breakfast was the usual fare at these sorts of establishments, but the waiter was very heavy handed and crashed and banged his way around the room clearing the tables – eventually I had to cut my breakfast short because he was giving me a headache.

I have emailed Low Cost Holidays and await their reply. The hotel itself could not care less about either customer service or whether their guests have a pleasant stay.",1,2014,04,26
60,Great Location!,"Located on Las Ramblas off the Liceu Metro station. Great location to a lot of sites but rooms are very very basic. Staff tries to be helpful but we happen to be there during a few warm April days. Their air conditioning was not turned on and couldn't open the windows. Definitely uncomfortable!
But for the price and location, it's okay.",3,2014,04,23
60,Not too good,"Stayed two nights for my first time in Barcelona...Location is great, and staff is friendly...But air conditioner didn´t work well, and weather was hot, so couldn´t sleep well....Pillows were small and shallow..",2,2014,04,23
60,"Ideally located,excellent hotel staff!","We spent 4 nights last week in the hotel, which was ideally located on the La Rambla, very close to some of the main attractions in Barcelona,such as Bouqueria Market ,Gotic Quarter ,etc...
The staff is very kind, friendly and helpful,especially Anna!
Rooms are basic but clean, and the only missing part was  air-condition...
Breakfast was good: buffet-style.
Overall we had a very good and convenient stay!",4,2014,04,19
60,Good place to stay for city visit,"The Priente is located very convenient on  Les Ramblas, ""the"" centre road in Barcelona directly in the old city. All places of interest in the Gotic Quarter an the adjacent areas as Ribera and the old port, Barceloneta etc. can be reached by foot. The hotel  itself impressed me most with its especially friendly and helpful personal. The room ( we had the standard room ) is ok for a few days city visit, was clean and properly maintained, but some may consider it a bit small ( for 2 persons). Negative we felt the fact that the front of the building to the Las Ramblas is currently subject to restauration, although during aour 5 nights stay we could not see anybody working. But there is a rack installed and consequently the window could not be opened. So my recommendation for the next time: ask for a room not showing to the Las Ramblas. Overall we appreciated our stay very much. I would rate it as Good.",3,2014,04,15
60,Try a better place,"Traveled from Wisconsin to Spain, and was disappointed
Got family room 303, am still staying in it for two more days
No air conditioning, construction noise began early in the morning.
Waiting for management to fix things.
At night, when the rooms were so warm, Marc the front desk person said nothing can be done",1,2014,04,14
60,Satisfactory,"We recently spent 4 nights here on a city break. The location of the hotel is great for getting around and seeing Barcelona (it's a very walkable city) or for jumping on one of the organised open top bus tours which we always find useful for getting bearings.

The reception area can be a little chaotic at times but the welcome was friendly. 

We were staying in an internal room, i.e. one overlooking the glass atrium of the breakfast area. It was functional and not spacious. The bathroom was similarly compact and was not always cleaned to the best standard it should have been although I would not so far as to say it was dirty. The shower had a fixed glass screen that did not prevent water going onto the bathroom floor so care must be taken after showering not to slip. 

Word of warning: the mattress on the bed is extremely firm and somewhat unforgiving. And the 'pillow' is almost useless. Fold it over or ask for another from reception to bolster the support. 

There was scaffolding all over the front of the hotel when we stayed there (late March 2014) and I don't know if any of those rooms over looking La Rambla were being used but we were not disturbed whilst we were there. In fact, I'm not sure that anything was actually being done.

We took breakfast at the hotel on one morning for convenience. Very limited buffet-style affair. Adequate but you can get better and cheaper at one of the many cafes or patisseries elsewhere. Tip: if you haven't paid for breakfast and decide to take it, tell them at reception the night before as it is cheaper (for some reason) than just turning up on the morning.

As this was a birthday present, I don't know how much it cost and so cannot comment on value for money but generally it was an adequate hotel.",3,2014,04,13
60,Right on the Ramblas- where the action is,"Decent hotel & location, room was suitable for the price.  Hotel is being renovated, but doesn't interfere with the guests.  Your choice of things to do right out front on the Ramblas.  Would consider staying here again.",3,2014,04,13
60,Not clean,"This hotel is located on La Rambla and is convenient. However, the bathroom is not clean at all. There's a lot of water scum to the point that it will gross you out. The paint on the tub is coming off. It does not seem that they clean the tiles in the bathroom. There is barely any space around the sink to put your necessities. The air conditioner was not working. The wifi is extremely slow to the point that it's not worth bothering with. It's nice to have but can not barely utilize it. They did not have any face towels either. I would not recommend this hotel if you are looking for a clean bathroom.",2,2014,04,07
60,Quirky and great,"We spent 4 nights there recently, including Valentine's day.  The staff are very friendly and full of fun; for Valentine's hearts and flowers appeared everywhere.  The rooms are large, clean, comfortable and blessed with all one might need.  Situated on the Ramblas it is ideally situated for seeing this beautiful city.  We ate breakfast in the hotel, and excellent it was too.  The hotel is excellent value for money; could not recommend it more.",5,2014,04,06
60,Nice and centric hotel,"The location of the hotel is amazing, the rooms enough nice and very clean.
The personal is very helpful and nice.
I recomend this hotel if you want to visit Barcleona!
Close to the sea and also close to Plaza Cataluña.
The enviroment outside in Las Ramblas full of happy people.
And also close to La Boqueria.",4,2014,04,04
60,Re: great location and staff,"The location is excellent, the staff is helpful specially Laura and Mark. It's an old building and the facade is being renovated. The room is clean but the bathroom has a smell despite being clean. The centralized heating is difficult to adjust. Overall the service is great. ",4,2014,04,02
60,Cheap and very cheerful,"Stayed here for a 3 night city break and we're not disappointed. Location could not have been better, situated right next to Liceu metro stop on Las Ramblas surrounded by bars and restaurants. Staff were extremely helpful and looked things up on Google for us when we asked even though we did have access to free wifi. Room was basic but extremely clean and contemporary decor. Would stay here again! ",4,2014,03,21

60,"Great Staff, Great Location","Ok from the onset of our stay here, we were impressed, they give you bottled water upon your check in (with the best music playing in the lobby), room was great with a balcony, only complaint would be the hard beds.  The staff is great and will recommend the best places for young people who want to get out and party. Every nightclub and bar they recommended was amazing.  The location is great and avoids you having to take lots of taxis as everything is at your fingertips as soon as you walk out. Enjoyed this place and the pricing was good. Bathroom was spacious and clean, never indulged in the food, but it is available, internet worked good.  Lots of hot water…we were happy!",4,2014,03,07
60,Amazing husa oriente in barcelona!,Clean  and clean bathroom and it was amazing and the rooms were lovely and the balcony was very lovely. I would definitely stay there again. It was quit cool when you have the sweets at the counter. your amazing! Thank you so much!,5,2014,03,06
60,Room without a view,"My partner booked this hotel for its fabulous location and views and paid extra for a deluxe room with a balcony overlooking La Rambla. Unfortunately, when we arrived at the hotel we were advised that they were undergoing re-construction to the outside of the hotel so there was scaffolding over the whole front façade and (for safety reasons) the door to our balcony would be locked shut – we were so upset since every apartment/hotel in Barcelona has a ‘working’ balcony except the one we specifically booked for it’s lovely balcony! There was no offer of compensation just an apology. We later spoke to the manager who was much more helpful - we explained that had we been advised in advance, we would have either paid less for a room without a view or (more than likely) booked somewhere else, he was understanding and offered us free breakfast for the remainder of our stay.

Another unfortunate consequence to not having a balcony was the temperature of the room. We stayed in February which is their winter so they had the heating on full in the hotel – to us this was boiling and with no air conditioning in the room & no balcony door to open, we really struggled to sleep but they turned the heating off in our room after 2 attempts at requesting this from reception.

We booked a double room but it seems that no room in the hotel has any double beds so you will simply have twin beds pushed together which is quite annoying since they are not fixed you may find yourself slipping through the middle of the beds during the night.

You have to pay extra for the deluxe room which is standard policy but you would expect to get a much nicer room for paying this extra and whilst the room we received was quite big, it did need a lot of updating.

The room was miss-advertised for a number of reasons, as follows:
Comes with soundproof windows – though they do block some of the noise, they’re not soundproof, I think they are just double-glazed.

The deluxe room (at extra cost) comes with a free mini bar – don’t be fooled, the mini bar is re-stocked each day but only contains: 2 small bottles of water, 2 small bottles of coke, 2 small bottles of orange and lemon juice & a small packet of peanuts.

A fully equipped kitchen – not sure what this is referring to as we didn't even have tea or coffee facilities just a small overheating fridge.

Air conditioning – I think this might be season dependent as we didn't have it available in our room.",2,2014,03,05
60,good stay,Stayed here 2 nights from 2of march to the 4 room 216.Good location . Friendly staff . I would racomed  Pedro and Inigo at the reception the location in the Ramblas was excellent .Close to everything.Breakfast  good and till 11 am . the only thing to say is ...they could .do .....tea facilities in the room,4,2014,03,05
60,Good friendly hotel,"Stayed here for 5 nights, overall a good comfortable hotel.

We stayed in one of the front facing rooms, although a bit smaller than the other rooms, you do get an accessible small balcony. Great if you are a smoker! Don't be put off by the noise of the ramblas, you double glazed doors quieten the noise to acceptable levals.

The only gripe I had was having to change wifi codes everyday, but hey at least they give you free access.  

Don't order orange juice or any drinks from any of the eateries  outside before getting a price, a few of them charge 14 euros a glass.",4,2014,03,02
60,Great location,"For my first visit to Barcelona, I couldn't have chosen a better hotel to stay. The Oriente was ideally located on Las Ramblas so central to all the major sites that Barcleona has to offer. For someone travelling alone I couldn't have asked for more. The staff were friendly, the rooms comfortable and food excellent. A definite recommend and will definitely return.",4,2014,03,01
60,Great Location and Staff - Definitely recommended!!,"My boyfriend and I stayed in the 'husa oriente' in December. On arrival the receptionist was extremely helpful, providing us with maps and suggested places to eat.
Althought disappointed our room didnt have a view of la ramblas, being at the back it was very quiet. We requested extra pillows and blankets and got them immediately,
The room was a good size and clean. The shower room was also clean but water from the shower did go all over the floor. 
Location is perfect, right on la ramblas but we were advised to step away from la ramblas to eat.
We had breakfast in the hotel on one morning and it was good. There was a wide selection of hot and cold options and a variety of drinks.
The staff were really friendly throughout our stay and we were able to leave our luggage in a safe room on check out until later in the day. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and if we go back to Barcelona this is the only place we will stay.",5,2014,03,01
60,Good location and very friendly staff,"hotel locates in very city center. lots of activities, bars, restaurants, gifts shops, night clubs are just around, however at nights it is very noisy and can hear everything from hotel room. metro station is just few meters from hotel. staff can speak english quite well and are very friendly - always smile, try to help and hold very good atmosphere. breakfast is quite simple, but taste is ok. from negative side internet is very bad and if you have to be online it is very difficult. seems that walls are very thin and if you have noisy neighbors it will be not ok.",4,2014,03,01
60,Try somewhere else,"A great location but very poor hotel. Arrived to exterior under renovation. Checked in at 2pm and we stood and waited for the receptionist to finish her business before we were acknowledged. A rather uncomfortable length of time. Room was tiny with light weight camp bed style bed on wheels that moved when you sat on it. Bathroom was an arm's length from the bed with a broken door that could not be closed. Ventilator/generator? produced a loud droning noise all night, preventing us from sleeping. After complaining the next morning we asked for a room change and had to wait till after midday but the room was better. Breakfast was very low quality food. Coffee and tea was undrinkable, juices were unpleasant re-constituted very sugary variety. Pastries were soggy and unpleasant. The cheapest nasty bacon and sausage available and staff cut back to the minimum and ran ragged. As said, the location was great but then there are very many great locations in Barcelona. This hotel is best avoided.",1,2014,02,25
60,"Great location, fantastic staff!","Our first visit to Barcelona and wouldn't have chosen a better place to stay. Great location, very welcoming and helpful staff. We stayed for four nights and was given free WiFi in our rooms every day. We would highly recommended this hotel and would gladly stay here again.",4,2014,02,24
60,Short break,"Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. On arrival we were greeted by very friendly staff who took our suitcases to be secured in a room (we arrived aprox 10.30, check in wasnt until 2). We had a wonder around the streets and grabbed some lunch. Check in was smooth and quick, our room was 115 over looking las Ramblas, unfortunately because of the refeb there was scaffolding directly outside the window so wasnt able to open it up. Room was lovely and spacious and no problems with the noise from the street. We were never offered the breakfast option so as I had been many times before knew exactly were to go Flaterlys Irish bar just tucked down the side of burger king. Its a must as the food is of brilliant quality and theres plenty of it. Again another great stay in beautiful Barcelona and wouldnt hesitate to rebook this hotel.",4,2014,02,22
60,Half term in Barcelona.,"Really good central location, nearest Metro stop was Liceu & Pl. Catalunya was just ahead at the top of La Ramblas.  Hotel was very clean, a little bit dated but perfect for what we needed, somewhere to sleep after busy days exploring Barcelona. 

The breakfast at 9€ was perfect for my boys  who like to eat a lot. Sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, pastries, fruit, breads, cheeses, hams & cereals. Staff were incredibly helpful & friendly. Family room was on the 1st floor facing La Ramblas, we had no bad noise issues, just dog barking one night & usual passer by & traffic noise. 

The free wi-fi was very welcomed.  Hot water took a while to run through in the shower but eventually gets very hot. The family room we were given was large, 2 singles beds pushed together & a double sofa bed which was all made & ready for us on arrival. Tv in the room which occupied the boys when we there.

For return trips to the airport there is an Aerobus for 5€ 90 per person which leaves from Pl. Catalunya at the top of La Ramblas frequently.",4,2014,02,21
60,Best staff ever,"I stayed in Husa Oriente Hotel on las ramblas street. The hotel in general is very nice. I would surely stay there again.
Although the beds weren't the best, the staff sure did bring my experience of this place to a great level!",5,2014,02,16
60,"Fantastic location, excellent staff!!","Firstly the hotel is situated in the heart of Las Ramblas so you can easily access the local attractions. There is a open air bus that will take you to places further away. The port is at the end of the road and a lovely walk as there are many street market stalls to peruse. Beware of the high prices in Las Ramblas main street (8 euros for 2 coffees) thanks to the amazing Ignacio, you can find a wonderful Plaza just opposite the hotel where there are plenty of bars and restaurants..
The shopping centre which was once a Bullring was a great shopping experience too.
Yes you can hear street noise but if you want peace then don`t stay in the heart of a city, go to stay in a field somewhere. It was brilliant being in the hustle and bustle of a city. As said before the hotel staff really are excellent, particularly Ignacio and Laura.
There is something for everyone for breakfast and to receive such a welcome from the staff every morning was really nice. Juan with the great big smile!
Overall an excellent stay and my Mum and I would like to say thanks once again to all the staff. (and for cutting off mum`s lock on her suitcase with bolt cutters!)
We would definitely recommend this hotel and will certainly be returning soon.",5,2014,02,12
60,The staff made this Hotel a great choice!,"This hotel is well situated on La Ramblas. A short walk to the harbour area and within walking distance of a lot of local attractions. There are 2 metro stations within a short stroll of the hotel which were handy to get to places like Sagrada Família. The aerobus from the airport stops a 10 minute walk from the hotel which is handy choice instead of paying out for a taxi. The cost per trip is 5.95 euros. Much cheaper than a taxi.
The rooms were very clean and well appointed, we had a room on the top floor overlooking the la Ramblas. Whilst there were the usual sounds that you'd expect of a city it did not bother us facing the main street. The staff here were all very cheery and helpful, especially a young man named Pedro. One morning we were without hot water and as compensation Pedro organised a complimentary breakfast for both of us. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff here, it's what made the choice of this hotel a good decision. At the time of our stay (late January 2014) the facade of the building was in the process of being renovated and scaffolding was being erected across the front of the building. If you intend staying there in the next few months I would check if the front facing rooms would have obstructed views due to the scaffolding. All in all a very good hotel that we would stay at again.",4,2014,02,04
60,Adequate hotel in a great location,"The hotel is in the best location in the city. Near transport links, the shops, restaurants, just perfect. The rooms were clean and a good size. However, the corridoors have marble flooring so sound echoes and travels easily. Every time someone speaks; it is amplified, everytime someone walks past; it is amplified, everytime a door closes; it is amplified. It made it hard to sleep one night.",3,2014,02,01
60,Brilliant staff lovely hotel,"Our 1st visit to Barcelona & could not have chosen a better place to stay, from checking in the staff were excellent so friendly and helpful nothing is too much trouble for them. 
The hotel itself is situated on La Ramblas so brilliant to reach all the usual tourists places. We bought our open top bus tour tickets from the hotel & by doing that saved €2 per ticket .
Out room was very quiet ,clean , nice bathroom , very comfortable bed & lots to choose from for breakfast.
Once again many thanks to all the staff on reception for their excellent service.",5,2014,01,25
60,WEEKEND IN BARCELONA,"Just come back from a long weekend in Barcelona. Stayed at the Husa Oriente Hotel. Great position right on Las Ramblas. Nice big room with hairdryer and bathroom smellies, lovely glass walk in shower, and plenty of clean towells. only down side no tea making facilities. Had a room at the back as we were warned noisy in front. lovely and quiet and blackout curtains. had a sound sleep. A big thank you to Marco for getting us more pillows at 12.30 midnight only took 10 mins to get them, thank you. Also our friends had a smelly bathroom drainy smell, told Marco, was done straight away, thank you again. Breakfast was ok, not a big selection but had all the basics, melon, cheese etc, toast, rolls, bacon scrambled eggs, cakes etc, cereals tea coffee and juices. and as much as you liked. all in a good hotel if having breakfast everyday only 9 eurs. not worth looking around to find any other breakfasts.. would recommend to all.",4,2014,01,22

60,A horrible bar,"The bar is called La bodega del Oriente. An exact time to serve a salad and pizza in a low-flow hour. The staff was watching the football. Plus they didn't bring the pizza I ordered, and it wasn't too good or at a good price. A mess. They served all the guiris around us before. They probably think they spend more.",1,2024,09,25

60,GREAT SOLUTION!!,"We came back after 5 years. Great location hotel, renovated and very nice reception, very nice and helpful reception staff. The room is clean, spacious and the bed comfortable.

60,Did not meet my expectations,"Good location, the reception and the building are really beautiful, but upon entering the rooms it disappoints a little as they are small and a little over time... the carpets of the corridors somewhat stained. Bathrooms are not very modern either. For the price, it's not justified. Also, there is a lot of noise at night, you can notice that groups of young people are staying when they are on the ramblas. Good thing: on each floor there are sparkling and still water dispensers and/or natural/cold. Very friendly employees.",3,2024,07,01
60,Excellent experience,"The hotel's location is good for quickly reaching Plaça de Catalunya, or places of interest such as Casa Batlló, Port Veil, the aquarium, the Gothic Quarter.

Friendly staff and international breakfast.",4,2024,06,18
60,Exceptional,"Phenomenal location, soundproofed rooms, abundant breakfast although for me the sweet part could have been more cared for, the bed and pillows are very comfortable and spotlessly clean, the mattresses are pure white, the bathroom products are excellent and I also have delicate skin, the hairdryer is super, which is usually the case in hotel...... towels and sheets always clean",4,2024,05,29
60,Not worth the asking price,"Great location, terrible maintenance and room services.
Directly on the Rambla, it has very old and deteriorated rooms not at all up to the economic demand, very old furnishings, poor air conditioning, empty mini bar",3,2024,05,22
60,City trip,"The hotel and the staff were very nice and friendly. We were particularly pleased with the daily goodie and the water that you can get in the hallway. The breakfast was also very good, although the selection could vary a bit for the price. The room was large and very nice. The only thing that was annoying was the noise at night, which was sometimes unbearable. It's clear that things are happening right on the Rambla. However, in a hotel of this price range, tight windows would be a must.",4,2024,05,21

60,Excellent experience in the hotel stay,"Excellent stay at the hotel, very comfortable rooms with a small balcony overlooking the Rambla, very friendly staff, close to everything you need, in front of Plaza Real, with many restaurants to choose from with different styles and prices, very good location and we loved that they always had iced, natural and sparkling water to refill a glass bottle that is in the room, this is an excellent idea, in addition, the decoration is beautiful, 100% recommended.",5,2024,03,13
60,My favorite hotel,"My favorite hotel in a protected palace. Very well located. Close to the sea, the shops, the Gothic quarter... easy arrival by Aerobús to Plaza de Catalunya.

Excellent breakfast…various choice…international breakfast…. Really great location especially central and quiet area.. ☺️ ☺️",5,2024,02,16
60,He enchanted me,"It was a perfect stay, the location of the hotel is exactly on the Rambla, 10 steps from the entrance there is the Liceu metro stop, exactly opposite there is Placa Reial with many clubs, for most of the time we were there move on foot as everything could be reached in a maximum of 30 minutes.
The guys at the reception were all helpful and friendly, they satisfied all our requests and curiosities.
The breakfast was plentiful and constantly replaced, from sweet to savory, if I can express a small tip, I would suggest something local and typical of Catalonia.
The room was small but welcoming and had everything you needed, perfectly soundproofed and cleaned every day with towels replaced.
The atrium at the entrance of the hotel was something wonderful, in colonial style with a truly fascinating retro touch, and the breakfast room was also beautiful with friezes all around the windows, and one of these was original, before the restoration, the I found a fantastic idea!
We will certainly return to Oriente Atiram if we were to choose another stay in Barcelona!",5,2024,02,12
60,Experience to be repeated,"Central location on the Rambla, very clean and courteous and competent staff, spacious room with very comfortable beds. Bathroom in the room very clean although a little dated, with very clean, soft and fragrant bath linen. Breakfast 10e praise.
An experience to be repeated endlessly,",5,2024,02,10
60,Where I always return.,"It is my hotel of choice whenever I visit Barcelona. The room with a balcony is what I'm looking for, looking at La Rambla at any time is a luxury.

My gratitude to everyone and especially to Julio and Daniel.",5,2024,02,01
60,No heating in January!!!!,"We stayed the night of January 13, without heating in the room. The hotel staff was very kind providing us with extra blankets but we still felt cold.

60,Excellent location to discover Barcelona,"I stayed for the New Year holidays in this hotel.
Clean rooms, very kind staff, a good breakfast in the morning. The location is also very convenient to all services.

Rooms are dated so you have to know they have those age defects.
I changed two of them and the best one in terms of space is the one with the double double bed even if it cannot be divided to create two single beds, which overlooks the side street 238. There is no noise.
However, the one with the two single beds is slightly smaller and has an internal window.

60,Spacious room,"There was only one electrical socket in the room to charge phones and there were four of us.
The room was large and spacious.
The water dispensers present in various parts of the hotel are very useful, with still and sparkling water.

60,Resident and without knowing a movie hotel,"Dream hotel, small but super cozy room, leave the key at reception every time you leave, at first it made me uncomfortable, but truly, the reception did not put on a bad face at any time, friendly and polite people, to repeat",4,2023,12,11
60,Overrated,"Not very inclusive of older people, old, small and slow elevators. Overrated breakfast and few options.

60,Four days of relaxation,"The room was a bit small, and it was a shame it didn't have a terrace.

60,Tissue paper walls and very rude guests,Totally non-soundproof rooms make the stay unbearable. Impossible to sleep for 4 nights... TV and shouting from very rude guests. Hotel frequented by rude guests and not managed by hotel staff. The neighbors changed almost every evening but always with the same result: impossible to sleep.,2,2023,10,30
60,East Atiram Barcelona,"Hotel in an excellent central location, close to the Liceu metro station and a few steps from Piazza de Catalunja.

60,"Mehrfacher Zimmerwechsel, Laut, unfreundlich","Das Hotel war eine reine Zumutung!
Zu Beginn bekamen wir ein Zimmer das buchstäblich von einer Abstellkammer in ein Zimmer umgewandelt wurde OHNE Tageslicht, mit extrem dreckigen Gummiboden und Badezimmer mit Schranktüren als Türen ohne Griff von innen. Das Hotel war an diesem Tag ausgebucht, weshalb wir für eine Nacht bleiben mussten. Am nächsten Tag (natürlich musste man wieder bis 14.00-15.00 zum Check In warten bis die Zimmer fertig waren) kommen wir in unser neues Zimmer: die Tür geht normal auf(!) Und es sitzt ein fremder Mann in diesem Zimmer! Das Zimmer wurde also doppelt vergeben. Danach wurde uns ein neues Zimmer gegeben, wir kommen an und es ist ein Zimmer, das erst frisch verlassen wurde - natürlich vollkommen dreckig und nicht fertig ist. WAHNSINN. Erst nach all dem haben wir als 4.!! Zimmer ein normales bekommen. Bei der Rezeption gab es gerade einmal eine einzige nette und hilfsbereite Damen mit etwa schulterlangen, braunen Haaren und einer größeren schwarzen Brille. Aber der Rest der Mitarbeiter war inkompetent und unfreundlich. Man hat sich total ignoriert gefühlt. 
Im gesamten Hotel spürt und hört man im 10 Minuten Takt die U-Bahn unter dem Hotel durchfahren! Davon weiß man natürlich nicht, wenn man das Hotel bucht. Ansonsten waren die Betten ganz okay, das Bad auch, wobei einmal  keine neuen Handtücher gebracht wurden und einmal gar nicht geputzt wurde. Wir haben zu Beginn auch nur ein einziges Laken zum Schlafen bekommen. 
Das beste kam dann noch zum Schluss beim Auschecken als uns gesagt wurde wir haben noch ein Frühstück zu zahlen, wobei wir kein einziges Mal in diesem Hotel gegessen haben. Das einzig schöne an diesem Hotel ist die Lobby aber da hört es auch schon auf. Ich würde es persönlich niemandem empfehlen.",1,2023,07,25
60,No se alojen en este hotel,"No se alojen en este hotel; en verano es terrible porque los aires acondicionados no funcionan y ante nuestro reclamo, fueron unas personas a verlo y no pudieron arreglarlo porque eran instalaciones muy viejas (dijeron que de los años 60). Como solución ofrecieron entregarnos 2 ventiladores. Por supuesto que esto no era solución para nosotros, considerando el precio de la habitación y solo despues de insistir y de haber pasado una pésima noche, nos cambiaron a una habitación superior con aire funcionando. Las habitaciones son tremendamente estrechas y lo unico lindo es el salon comun que muestran en las fotos, cuando llegas a recepcion. Añado como dato que está mas cerca de colon que la plaza catalunya, por lo que es un largo trayecto de caminata si llegan en el bus del aeropuerto. Sí puedo decir que era limpio. ",1,2023,07,05
60,Regular,"El hotel cuenta con habitaciones muy pequeñas , ni siquiera tiene nevera en la habitación y aunque se encuentra muy bien situado no tiene  un guarda de seguridad a la entrada para revisar que la personas  que ingresan al hotel sean huéspedes , lo que hace que uno se sienta inseguro . Además falta variedad en el desayuno .
Un hotel promedio . Y un poco costoso",3,2023,06,27
60,Excelente ubicación!,"Muy lindo hotel y muy bien ubicado en la rambla. Muy buena atención!
El tema del impuesto turistico es caro, pero el hotel no tienen nada que ver en esto.

60,Hotel pesimo,"El hotel pésimo, cuarto viejos y con olor a encierro. Lo peor fue que a las 5 de la mañana empezó a soñar la alarma de incendio por todo el edificio,  fue una falsa alarma todos descalzos con pijamas en el hobby. No la pudieron arreglar hasta las 7 am. Ni unas disculpas, no atendían en la recepción cuando llamamos para ver qué pasaba. Pésima experiencia. No recomiendo este hotel para nadie",1,2023,05,07
60,Regular servicio ,"Excelente ubicación, la recepción es hermosa y el personal atento, la alcoba con el suelo deteriorado da muy mal aspecto. Nuestra experiencia fu mala con el desayuno, poca variedad, en uno de los días  de nuestra estadía no tenían huevos ",3,2023,04,04

60,alternde Lady,"Preis-Leistungsverhältnis war sehr gut, da das Hotel die beste Citylage aufweist - Metrostation Liceu ist ca. 200 m entfernt, die Altstadt ist gegenüber -  und das Zimmer, die Betten und Bad  sehr sauber waren.

Ein Punkteabzug, da sich das Fenster in Richtung Innenhof nicht selbstständig öffnen ließ und die Zimmertemperatur auf gefühlte 30 Grad kletterte.
Der Laminat im Eingangsbereich war kaputt, sodass das Zimmer abgewohnt wirkte. Frühstück ausreichend und gut.
FAZIT: das Hotel ist vergleichbar mit einer alternden Lady, die Schönheitsmakel mit Makeup kaschiert",4,2023,02,27

Buona la colazione per la quantità e la qualità dei prodotti offerti,  le bevande calde sono disponibili solo al distributore automatico. La posizione  strategica dell'hotel  ci ha permesso di raggiungere i diversi punti di interesse sia a piedi sia con l'utilizzo della metro. La nostra camera doppia aveva letti e cuscini comodissimi. Nel  bagno (senza finestra) non era presente la doccia ma una vasca con tenda. Pulizia ottima. ",4,2023,02,26

60,Die gute Lage entschädigt so einiges,"Die Lage ist wirklich super, aber unser Zimmer entsprach nicht den Bildern bei Booking. Lobby und Zimmer sind schon sehr in die Jahre gekommen. Das Frühstück ist sein Geld nicht wert. Würde das Hotel zwar nochmal buchen, aber ohne Frühstück. Dafür würde ich in ein Cafe um die Ecke gehen. Die Lage war das beste am Hotel.

lo raccomanderei e ci tornerei sicuramente.",5,2023,01,11
60,"Consigliato, posizione ottima","Posizione ottima (infatti super consigliato per questo), personale molto gentile. Una pecca molto grande però è che per la cassaforte serve un deposito di 10€ per riceverne la chiave, non sono tanto i 10€ come costo visto che viene reso, quanto il fatto che non tutti portano contanti (come nella nostra situazione, nessuno dei due ne aveva). C'era una crepa nella doccia ma nulla che ne impedisse l'utilizzo. Phon e acqua calda disponibili, check-in e check-out flessibile (molto comodo). ",4,2022,12,30

60,Vacanza mamma e figlia,"Ho soggiornato con mia figlia in questo Hotel per la nostra vacanza a Barcellona;l'hotel si trova in posizione ottimale,il personale è molto gentile  e l'ambiente è pulito .La colazione è un pò scarsa per essere una colazione continentale a buffet ;le stanze molto  poco insonorizzate sono però la cosa peggiore.",4,2022,08,26
60,vacanza in famiglia,"Noi ci siamo trovati bene. Abbiamo scelto questo hotel per la posizione e perchè nel prezzo mi dava anche il parcheggio (cosa da non sottovalutare se arrivi a Barcellona in macchina).
La camera era da 4. Letti singoli ma molto comodi. Camera molto spaziosa e si affacciava sulla rambla. Con le finestre chiuse i rumori non ci hanno dato molto fastidio. Il condizionatore funzionava bene e in camera avevamo un frigo. 
Il personale è stato gentile, abbiamo avuto un problema con la macchina appena arrivati lì e si sono resi molto disponibili per aiutarci. ....anche se poi non sono riusciti ...ma la disponibilità c'è stata.
Colazione molto semplice però la fame te la togli.",4,2022,08,23
60,Che delusione,"Siamo arrivati il 10/8 sera, sistemati in camera, facciamo un giro per il centro e rientriamo in Hotel. Ingresso aria condizionata a palla. Dormiamo e al mattino ci svegliamo un po' sudati, sarà il caldo. Seconda notte proviamo ad accendere aria condizionata ma nessuno segno di vita. La mattina dopo lo faccio presente alla reception che l'aria condizionata non funzionava. Con un sorriso mi risponde che hanno un guasto e hanno già chiamato i tecnici (dicono che 20 camere sono purtroppo senza aria!)..per rattoppare al malfatto ci mettono un ventilatore in camera!
Per farla breve....ogni giorno ci dicevamo che venivano i tecnici ma l'aria condizionata non funzionava...
Oltre a questo inconveniente per noi molto grave, avevamo la vasca con un taglio. Il tappeto antiscivolo non è igienico! Camera con quattro letti molto stretta. 
Abbiamo dormito poco anche perché tenevano la finestra aperta x il caldo e quindi si sentiva di tutto (pazienza lo sapevo che eravamo in centro).
Poi un giorno il televisore non funziona più, vado a chiedere alla reception e con un sorriso mi dicono che c'è problema con l'antenna. Stranamente non si poteva cambiare canale e neanche aumentare il volume!
L'unica cosa positiva era la colazione, ben fornita, sempre fresco! E la posizione vicino metro e bus!
Al checkout ho richiesto e con stupore mi dicono che l'aria condizionata ora funziona ! Sembra proprio che ci hanno preso in giro",2,2022,08,22
60,"Excelente patio, magnífica ubicación, muy buena atención","Hotel con un estilo propio, ubicado en plenas Ramblas de Barcelona. Lo mejor fue el magnífico patio-hall de entrada y su excelente climatización que vino muy bien en plena ola de calor.

60,HORRIBLE NO PISAR ESO HACERME CASO,"Fue increíblemente caro y malo cojemos una noche para el 23 de junio y no sabemos que paso kn su web y se puso para el día dos que fue el día que reservamos y pagamos pues nos llaman el día 2 que a qué hora íbamos a entrar nos llaman a las 10 de la noche una cosa rarísima les decimos que llegaríamos a las 5 de la tarde nos dicen qir vale que llamemos mejor antes de ir 
Nos ponemos con ellos en contacto el día 23 para decir la hora y nos dicen que la reserva era para el día 2 que ya paso increíble estábamos en el aeropuerto y nos decían que estábamos sin hotel que nos habían cobrado ya el dinero que estábamos sin habitación que no había disponibilidad cual es mi sorpresa que entró en la web y en tripvisor y si hay habitaciones vuelvo a llamar después de 30 mints al tlf esperando me vuelven a decir que no hay habitaciónes y les digo que sí que acabo de reservar una y me contestan que seria que su web va mal entices seguramente también va mal para y primera reserva que dicen que perdí el dinero ya pues 333€ de la primera reserva solo una noche y sin desayuno DE LOCOS.
Me vengo al hotel no me dan solución que no me devuelven el dinero y que si quiero que tengo que pagar otra vez mi respuesta es que no me muevo del hotel que llamen a la policía 
Viene la policía me dan la razón ya que me ven una persona pacífica y que estoy con un niño de 4 años y otro de 12 en Barcelona sin alojamiento por algo raro que paso en su página web 
Nada me vuelven a decir que tengo que pagar la noche y que haga una reclamación en consumo después de horas con esto ya son las 10 de la noche y no me queda otra que coger otra habitación y pagarla por que me hijo pequeño necesita cenar está cansado del viaje y tiene que descansar 
Pago la habitación y subo otros 300€ más solo por dormir para marcharme mañana a las 9 de la mañana llego a la habitación y una auténtica pocilga

60,Vacanza splendida,"7 giorni fantastici per godersi Barcellona anche grazie a questo hotel centralissimo. Abbiamo perlustrato i vicoli, raggiunto a piedi le principali attrazioni, ed anche il mare. Per chi non vuole camminare, invece, la metro è veramente vicina. L'hotel è molto accogliente, pulito, il mobilio non è dei più moderni ma è funzionale. Uniche pecche : manca lo scovolino de wc, le finestre che danno sull'interno sono bloccate per motivi di sicurezza, il personale delle pulizie è piuttosto rumoroso nel riassettare le camere. Resta comunque una struttura consigliata.",4,2022,07,07
60,Posizione eccellente ,"Molto gentili ,la posizione sulla Ramblas strategica vicinissimo alla metro .Siamo stati bene .
Ci hanno tenuto i bagagli perché il check-in era alle 14 e abbiamo potuto sfruttare in pieno i nostri giorni di vacanza e anche quando abbiamo lasciato le camere abbiamo potuto godere di questo servizio",5,2022,06,09
60,Camere vecchie,"Bella la hall, ottima la posizione dell’hotel, peccato per le camere vecchie, piccole ma soprattutto non insonorizzate.
Se avete problemi ad addormentarvi o avete il sonno leggero, questo hotel non fa per voi. Si sente tutto dalle altre camere. Non è un problema di piano noi eravamo al quarto e ultimo piano.",3,2022,05,30
60,buon hotel se non si hanno tante pretese,"Sono stata a barcellona solo due notti, e tutto sommato sono soddisfatta della mia scelta hotel. Oriente Atiram è molto scenografico all’ingresso arabeggiante e sala colazione bellissima. la nostra camera aveva cari problemi: il matrimoniale in realtà erano due letti divisi, di cui uno buono mentre l’altro completamente sfondato e ad ogni movimento faceva dei rumori terribili tanto da svegliare entrambi durante la notte; nella doccia mancava una delle due porte per chiuderla, quella più grande, per cui indubbiamente abbiamo bagnato tantissimo per terra. pochi appendini, neanche uno per appendere zaino o giacca. è vero che è un tre stelle, non mi aspettavo certo niente di lussuoso, ma un letto sfondato non si addice neanche a un ostello. aspetti positivi: posizione ottima, nella rambla, a due passi dalla fermata di liceu, la nostra camera dava sull’interno quindi silenziosa, l’unico problema è che la metro si sente tantissimo, ad ogni passaggio (circa ogni due minuti durante il giorno) trema tutto, però la metro è ferma da mezzanotte alle 5. colazione ottima, bellissima sala, ben fornita per essere un tre stelle, ne vale il prezzo (anche perché avrei davvero avuto difficoltà a fare colazione a barcellona)",3,2022,05,04
60,Decepción,"El hotel tiene buena ubicación pero las habitaciones no tienen refrigerador, la calefacción y el aire acondicionado son centrales y depende de que lo enciendan. De hecho un par de noches pasamos frío.
El desayuno es regular.
Destacamos la amabilidad de sus trabajadores",3,2022,04,26
60,Un buen lugar en Barcelona,El hotel presta un excelente servicio y además la ubicación es estratégica para recorrer Barcelona. El personal es sumamente atento y están siempre dispuestos a ayudar. Es la tercera vez que nos alojamos allí y volveríamos a hacerlo.,5,2022,04,20
60,Nie wieder,"Die Zimmer entsprechen in keiner Weise den Bildern auf Booking.com. Eine Beschwerde blieb erfolglos. Die Dame an der Rezeption hat nicht mal nachgeschaut, ob sie andere Zimmer hat. Unser Anliegen war ihr völlig egal. Wir hätten sogar einen Mehrpreis bezahlt. Unsere Zimmer waren schäbig, abgewohnt und der Blick ging auf eine ziegelwand. Bei jeder Drehung im Bett haben die Sprungfedern protestiert. In der Dusche war es nicht möglich, eine konstante Temperatur zu halten. Beim Frühstück gab es deutlich weniger Auswahl als die Bilder im Internet versprochen haben. Nie wieder! Wir sind sehr enttäuscht",2,2022,04,19
60,Hotel de 3 estrellas a precio de 5,"Desayuno pobre, en BCN esperas desayunar pan con tomate y ni eso. No hubo fruta. Precio desorbitado para un hotel normalito.

Ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo.",5,2022,02,16

60,Schönes Hotel in Bestlage Barcelonas,"Das schöne alte Haus an den Rambles hat innen vollständig moderne Zimmer. Insgesamt aber ist es einfacher, als man sich  aus Geschichte und Beschreibungen erwartet. Ein pompöses Foyer, das Zimmer stylish modern gestaltet. Aber sparsam: im sehr kleinen Zimmer mit Doppelbett ist nicht einmal ein Stuhl. Der Ventilator im Bad (Tür ganz nahe am Bett) läuft durchgehend und ist etwas laut, Und ein fremdsprachliches Programm steht im TV nicht zur Verfügung. Aber über diesen Kleinigkeiten steht der positive Eindruck. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich, alles ist ganz unkompliziert und die Sauberkeit ist perfekt. Und die Lage könnte nicht besser sein. Metro vor der Tür, die schönsten Plätze Barcelonas zu Fuß zu erreichen. Dazu ein wirklich gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis. Daher 4 Punkte.",4,2021,12,25
60,Ottimo Soggiorno,"Ho pernotato con mio marito, hotel molto bello ed elegante, ottima posizione per qualsiasi punto da raggiungere perché metropolitana a 2 passi. Ho preso camera con vista Rambla, carina e pulita. Colazione con ottima scelta. Prezzo molto buono, per una cancellazione volo Ho dovuto spostare la data e sono stati subito efficienti senza costi aggiuntivi. 
Ho fatto un buon soggiorno.",4,2021,12,12
60,Stile Oriente nel cuore della Rambla,"Ho alleggiato in questo Hotel il weekend scorso per trascorrere il mio compleanno. L’albergo è molto bello e tutto in stile orientale, soprattutto la hall è bellissima e molto accogliente. Il personale parla la nostra lingua. Le camere erano pulite e spaziose . L’unica pecca è che non c’è il frigo bar. La posizione è strategica in quanto si trova nel cuore della Rambla a 2 passi dalla metro Liceu. Il prezzo di due notti era di 160€ diviso 2. È veramente un ottimo affare considerando lsoprattutto la posizione. Consigliatissimo!!!",5,2021,11,18
60,No AC,"El lobby del hotel esta muy bonito y remodelado, en cambio las habitaciones lucen un poco viejas y sin comodidades. Excelente ubicacion. Sin embargo, no nos sentimos comodos ya que no tuvimos AC en la habitacion. Mencionaron que estaba en mantanimiento y que en ese epoca no se usa. La temperatura no estaba agradable siendo aun mediados de octubre y ademas es una decision personal del huesped. Yo pague por el servicio (ya que estaba incluido en sus facilidades) y no lo tuve. Abrir las ventanas es imposible con el ruido de la zona. El desayuno muy pobre. 
Resumen, buena ubicación pero no el mejor hotel comodidad.",2,2021,11,02
60,Pésimo. Un lugar para olvidar.,"Reservé con un mes de antelación una habitación para 3 adultos y un niño. La habitación no tenía nada que ver con las fotos de su web, estaba sucia, sin decoración, sólo 4 camas individuales. El suelo estropeado, las sábanas y mantas sucias, con bolas de pelo. La tv no tenía mando y tuvo que venir el chico de recepción que no sabía dónde meterse, nos pidió disculpas mil veces y nos dijo que sólo llevaba trabajando en ese hotel un mes. Lo único bueno que tiene el hotel es la ubicación. La limpieza es pésima, el desayuno buffet estaba bueno, pero los platos y tazas también estaban sucios y en algunos platos había hasta pelos. En definitiva, una experiencia para olvidar.",2,2021,10,28
60,ottima posizione sulla rambla,"Ingresso hall fantastico e spazioso, camera quadrupla con balcone lato rambla molto pulita e arredata bene. Un pò scomodo il materasso del divano letto.

60,Buena relación calidad precio en una situación perfecta ,"Buena relación calidad-precio y la situación es perfecta para conocer la ciudad, básico y cómodo con habitaciones grandes aunque un poco antiguas pero aún así cómodas. No le doy las 5 estrellas solo porque la habitación daba a un patio interior con los aires acondicionados y era un poco molesto.",4,2021,10,17
60,Ottima esperienza,"Personale super accogliente, i ragazzi della reception parlano quasi tutti l’italiano ed erano sempre disponibili. L’hotel si trova in una posizione strategica. Pulizia della camera ottima. La colazione abbastanza ricca.
Consiglio questo hotel e ci ritornerei!",4,2021,10,09
60,Un poco descripción,"Los únicos puntos positivos era que el personal es super amable y la limpieza.

La habitación que tuvimos era de lo mas básico… la puerta del lavabo no se podía cerrar con llave. No había nevera. 3 enchufes en toda la habitación. Mobiliario viejo. Moho en la pared al lado de la televisión. 4 canales en la TV. El desayuno era super minimalista, no había distancias entre mesas, la gente sin mascarilla sin guantes sirviendo se  del buffet.  Llegamos a las 8:30h a la sala y ya apenas quedaba comida. Decidimos no desayunar en el Hotel y fuimos a una cafetería cercana. 
Es una pena porque la ubicación es mas que perfecta y el personal  es de lo mas amable. Nosotros no volveremos ya que el precio que pagas para el servicio que recibes no esta en ninguna relación.

60,Stanza trasandata e rumorosa,"Ho soggiornato con la mia famiglia all’Oriente Atiram a Ottobre 2021 in una camera quadrupla. L’avevo scelto guardando le foto trovate sul sito e su Booking, che però ahimè non rispecchiano assolutamente quello che abbiamo trovato. La stanza aveva un letto matrimoniale e un divano letto rovinato e arrugginito, con un materasso sottilissimo e molto scomodo. La stanza inoltre non aveva nessun tipo di insonorizzazione. Purtroppo nella stanza accanto alla nostra soggiornava un gruppo di ragazze perennemente ubriache e alterate che hanno schiamazzato per ore, non permettendoci di chiudere occhio per tutta la notte. In un albergo con un’insonorizzazione migliore questo non sarebbe successo, dato che sembrava di averle in camera con noi. Anche i rumori dalla strada si sentono molto forti. Non ci tornerei mai più.",1,2021,10,04
60,Ottima posizione,"Pulizia ottima, hotel accogliente e ampiamente spazioso, camere dotate di tutti confort e pulitissime! La centralità dell’hotel è il suo pezzo forte! Direttamente sulla rambla !

Hotel ben collegato alla città.",3,2021,08,19
60,Albergo carino,"Albergo carino, buona posizione. Bagno datato. Di notte si sentivano le voci delle signore dalla strada, se avete il sonno leggero non prendete una stanza che ha le finestre sulle Ramblas.  Se avete bisogno di fare il tampone per il ritorno chiedete in farmacia perché gli alberghi vi manderanno tutti nello stesso laboratorio con code interminabili e prezzi più alti.",3,2021,07,17
60,Viel zu teuer,"Das Hotel ist unter dem Strich eine riesige Enttäuschung und ich kann nur davor warnen es gutgläubig zu buchen. Das Hotel liegt direkt am Rambla, das ist praktisch. Zum parken allerdings unpraktisch. Das Hotel macht äußerlich sowie außerhalb der Zimmer einen wunderschönen Eindruck. Das wars dabn auch. Das Innenleben der Zimmer ist spartanisch, das Frühstück besteht aus Industrieprodukten und Plastik- sowie Verpackungsmüll. Das Hotel ist den Preis absolut nicht wert!!!!!!",2,2021,07,10
60,No mascarillas en el buffet del desayuno,"En la media hora que estuvimos desayunando, por lo menos 5 personas sin mascarilla estuvieron en el buffet, paseándose como si nada y cogiendo comida. Lo mejor los dos que estaban hablando mientras cogían la comida. 
El personal del hotel que estaba en el desayuno no les dijo nada. Mejor no ir a desayunar.",1,2021,07,01
60,Lo recomiendo y volveré aqui!,Este hotel tiene una muy buena ubicación. El personal es muy amable. El desayuno es excelente para todos los gustos. La habitación ha sido confortable aunque al principio nos dieron una habitación bastante pequeña para 4 personas con una cama y  una canapé extensible aunque había pedido sólo camas. El día siguente cambiarón sin problemas con una habitación grande y con camas grandes. Recomiendo este hotel!,5,2020,09,18
60,Super!,"Hotel pulito sia nelle parti comuni che in camera. Quest'ultima molto spaziosa; la camera quadrupla a noi assegnata era composta da letto matrimoniale + divano letto (abbastanza comodo), bagno di dimensioni ragionevoli, con vasca.

60,5 GIORNI A BARCÁ,"Ho prenotato l’hotel poco prima della mia partenza,non ero convinto al 100% ma con la possibilità di pagare in hotel ci siamo fidati. Abbiamo avuto una piacevole scoperta. Hotel sulle Ramblas,centrale. Il palazzo è antico,molto bello. Camere con vista sulla Ramblas veramente carine. Pulizia degna di nota. Receptionist preparati e disponibili. Uno di loro mi ha consigliato un ottimo ristorante per una cena a base di carne. Sicuramente ci sarà modo di alloggiare di nuovo qui. ",5,2020,03,15

60,Buen hotel 3 estrellas,"La ubicacion es inmejorable. El desayuno bueno pero muy poco variado. La limpieza muy buena, ocupamos una hab superior , a la calle , excelente; ningun ruido. Muy tarde el check in, 14 hs. y no te dan la hab ni un mimuto antes. Esperamos siete horas despues de doce horas de vuelo. De todos modos volveria al hotel por todo lo positivo expresado y su buen precio.",5,2019,11,26
60,Bien ubicado,"Un hotel antiguo ubicado en las Ramblas y cerca de una estación del metro de Barcelona. Los cuartos son normales, un televisor pequeño y se escucha mucho ruido. Dependiendo del presupuesto es una buena opción. El desayuno es bueno y te puedes mover a sitios claves que quedan muy cerca. Para comprar hay diferentes puestos y tiendas para comprar detalles o ropa.",4,2019,10,17
60,"gute Lage, alles andere okei","Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral, hat eine tolle Lage. Das Zimmer war gross genug, jedoch leider ohne Balkon. Das ""Doppelbett"" bestand aus zwei Einzelbetten, welche man auseinander schieben kann. Dadurch entsteht immer eine gewisse Lücke dazwischen. Die Matratzen waren eher hart, jedoch sauber.
Das Zimmer besitzt eine Klimaanlage und ist sauber.
Das Badezimmer ist eher klein und beim Duschen läuft das Wasser auf den Badezimmerboden, weil die Türe nicht dicht verschlossen werden kann (Foto).
Das Fenster im Badezimmer war unverschliessbar (Foto).
Das Zimmer ist im gesamten eher alt und abgenutzt. Für Kurzstädtetrips ist es jedoch geeignet.",3,2019,10,15
60,Hotel sucio y en mal estado,"El personal es amable pero el hotel es pésimo ,sin mantenimiento , el apoya cabeza de la cama sucio , las sabanas sucias , las paredes manchadas! Para sumar el aire acondicionado no se puede regular y tira 10 min de frió cada 2 horas,tenia dos enchufes en toda la habitación y no estaban cerca de la cama por lo tanto los celulares había que ir a buscarlos al piso enfrente a la puerta del baño. 
Lo alquilamos porq estaba en la Rambla pero fue un error.

60,20-22 agosto,"Ultimi 2 gg di ferie a Barcellona.
Posizione centralissima, ottima. 
Stanza e bagno vecchi in contrapposizione al dinamismo della hall aperta 24h, e delle amenities: bottilglia di vino in omaggio, lecca lecca e la shopper sul cuscino, il simpatico saluto scritto sul vetro del bagno, che fanno sempre piacere agli ospiti.
Camera tripla grande, insonorizzata dal caos della rambla, anche se la metro sottostante si sente, letti comodi con doppi cuscini alla francese (quelli lunghi) a persona.
Ottima climatizzazione.
Ottima la pulizia e la cortesia delle cameriere sempre con il sorriso.
Manca il frigo. 
Torneremo.",4,2019,08,27
60,Tre stelle consigliabile,"In pieno agosto sulla Rambla quindi nel centro pieno della vita di Barcellona. Camera da 4 pulita e confortevole, silenziosa di notte e correttamente climatizzata pur se con arredi e bagno vecchiotti. Colazione soddisfacente. Prezzo giusto visto il periodo. Consigliato per una visita alla citta' per non perdere tempo nei trasferimenti da e per il centro",4,2019,08,14
60,Posizione ottimale sulla Rambla e molto pulito ,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel io e il mio ragazzo dal 23 luglio al 26 luglio, il prezzo è stato più che giusto, la posizione dell’Hotel è ottimale perché ti trovi sulla rambla, peccato che la nostra stanza affacciava in una via secondaria dove al di fuori al balcone si sentivano i peggio rumori ma all’interno della stanza niente infatti credo che siano proprio insonorizzate, la pulizia della stanza molto professionale e ogni giorno cambio di asciugamani e nuovi bagnoschiuma per il corpo e shampoo per i capelli. L’unica piccolissima pecca è stato la professionalità della reception raramente salutavano ma non è stato il problema principale bensì secondo il mio punto di vista soggettivo non capivano l’Italiano e quindi bisognava parlare per forza in Spagnolo o Inglese cosa un po’ ambigua perche all’estero se lavori in un hotel perlomeno tutte le lingue dovresti conoscerle...
Detto ciò all’atto pratico secondo me è un hotel consigliabile, non vi so dire a riguardo della colazione perché non l’avevamo nell’offerta. Posto sotto le foto della nostra camera magari può essere utile :) ",3,2019,07,29
60,vecchio in posizione eccellente,"l'hotel si trova al centro della Rambla, quindi in posizione eccellente. Ancora solo i letti sono buoni perchè molto comodi. Per il resto la struttura è vecchia, senza alcuna personalità. Ci sono stanze interne addirittua prive di finestre, con bagni non più accettabili da viaggiatori comuni. Personale invisibile, se non al ricevimento, pagamento all'arrivo, pulizia su richiesta. Caro per quello che offre, forse più per un due stelle.",3,2019,06,27
60,Soluzione perfetta,"Hotel molto valido ed in posizione comodissima, essendo a metà Rambla e vicino alla fermata della Metro e di alcuni bus. Personale della reception gentile, disponibile e preparato. Struttura datata ma comunque in grado di soddisfare molte esigenze (tranne le fisse degli italiani che vogliono il bidet ovunque...) La camera è spaziosa e ben insonorizzata.  La colazione propone diverse pietanze, in modo da soddisfare tutte le esigenze. L'unica piccola anomalia è che mi hanno chiesto il pagamento al momento del check-in ma questo non ha influito sulla mia valutazione. Lo consiglio.",5,2019,06,20

60,Se destaca atencion del personal de recepcion,"Este hotel resulta muy bien ubicado. Sobresalen la limpieza del hotel y la amabilidad del personal ,especialmente el de recepcion. Destaco la educacion del Sr. Fernan siempre dispuesto con educacion a brindar la informacion requerida. Las habitaciones (con vista al exterior) son amplias. El baño resulta antiguo con azulejos(algunos) rotos pero pintados .El desayuno bueno . La habitacion a pesar de ser externa no presentaba ruidos",3,2019,06,02
60,posizione centrale,"Albergo un pò datato, con arredi semplici ma bagno ancora con la vasca e senza bidet.....

Las habitaciones muy limpias y de eso sí que soy de lo más quisquillosa , pero siempre la encontré en buenas condiciones ",5,2019,04,24
60,Tutto perfetto. Da migliorare il fattore cortesia,"Ho soggiornato presso questo hotel la prima settimana di aprile. Ottima la posizione, vicina alla metropolitana, i bus di linea a 30 min dall'aeroporto e vicino a tutte le principali attrazioni. Nulla da dire sulle camere e sulla pulizia, davvero eccellente. L'unica cosa che mi ha leggermente infastidito riguarda la poca attenzione rivolta agli ospiti. Uscivamo e rientravamo senza ricevere un saluto, anzi spesso li guardavo per salutare e abbassavano la testa. In più poco prima della partenza, il receptionist che era di turno quella mattina, ha chiesto solo alla mia amica come fosse andato il soggiorno, come se io non fossi presente in quell'istante. Faccio molta attenzione a questi piccoli gesti e non mi è piaciuto per niente. Da migliorare assolutamente il fattore cortesia/ gentilezza / attenzione al cliente !",3,2019,04,20
60,Follia pura !!!,"Da tanti anni che viaggio .... mai accauduto che al check in abbiamo preteso il pagamento dell’intero soggiorno prima di averci fatto visionare la camera !!!!
Nonostante le nostre rimostranze sono stati inflessibili e arroganti , pagamento conn carte con estrema difficoltà , qualità delle camere pessima.     .... e oltre a cio tv non funzionante e alla richiesta di intervento , al momento non disponibile !
Conclusione ... booking se volete continuare a mantenerci come clienti , mai piu vorremmo dover aver a che fare con situazioni simili !!!!
Aspettare la vacanza per rilassarci e ..e doverci stressare non fa per noi ....e purtroppo questa destinazione e’ da voi caldamente suggierita !!!!",1,2019,04,18
60,ottimo hotel,"Ottimo hotel per una visita a barcellona. situato sulla rambla, vicino alla metro.Siamo stati accolti da personale gentile, la camera spaziosa e pulita, la colazione  con diversi cibi dal dolce al salato alla frutta in un ambiente particolare. Se dovessi tornare a barcellona sceglierei ancora questo hotel.",5,2019,03,14
60,soggiorno perfetto,"Abbiamo alloggiato per 4 giorni, hotel in una posizione davvero centrale, personale super cortese e attento ad ogni esigenza, pulizia davvero efficiente. Certo, l'hotel rientra tra i più antichi di Barcellona, quindi manca di alcune accortezze che non pregiudicano il soggiorno (come le prese vicino al letto o il bollitore in camera). Nel complesso sono pienamente soddisfatta e lo consiglierei",5,2019,03,11
60,"Ottima posizione , cortesia e pulizia top","Seguendo già i numerosi post mi sono recato a colpo sicuro in questo hotel e vi ho trovato esattamente cio' che mi aspettavo : posizione eccezionale , stanze spaziose rispetto a alberghi simili , cortesia del personale e soprattutto pulizia delle camere perfetta. Consigliatissimo per gente che viaggia seriamente.",5,2019,03,06
60,Tolles Hotel,"Wir hatten 2 Zimmer (einmal 2 Einzelbetten, einmal ein Doppelbett).
Doppelbett war etwas instabil - man spürte, wenn sich der Partner im Bett nachdrehte.
Zimmer und Badezimmer waren groß genug und sauber.
Zimmer war Richtung Hinterhof und daher ohne Straßenlärm. 
Störend war vielleicht die Lüftung der Klimaanlage bzw. vom Bad - diese ist aber fürs ganze Hotel und daher nicht abschaltbar. Ist aber nicht wirklich ein Minuspunkt.
Personal sehr freundlich.
wir würden hier wieder buchen",4,2019,02,24
60,Piacevole fine settimana,"Arrivti all'Hotel a notte fonda siamo stati accolti, in maniera impeccabile, dal simpaticissimo receptionist Emanuele che ci ha fornito tutte la informazioni per il gradevolissimo soggiorno presso l' hotel Oriente. Camera spaziosa, comoda e pulita, così come il bagno. Colazione ottima. Posizione dell'hotel fantastica. Intero staff cortese e disponibile. Sicuramente, tornando a Barcellona, alloggeremo di nuovo in questo Hotel.",5,2019,02,20
60,posizione strategica!,"abbiamo pernottato 4 notti in questo hotel, in camera 333 (qradrupla), che non affacciava sulla rambla bensì su una stradina secondaria. la qualità del sonno è buona, anche se la sera tardi si sentono le persone schiamazzare sul tardi, ma è tollerabile e si dorme bene.
la camera mi è sembrata abbastanza pulita, non abbiamo avuto problemi, anche se essendo in 4 avrei preferito qualche mensola e mobile in più. troppo riduttivo.
quello che più mi ha colpito è stata la gentilezza del personale al front office: superlativi! ci è sembrato subito di stare a casa nostra al sicuro, il che è importante viaggiando con 2 bambini. tra l'altro c'era anche un italiano di livorno (manu) che ci ha accolti con vera ospitalità e ci ha dato dei buoni consigli su dove mangiare. bravi tutti. veramente.
la colazione dell'alberga è buona: ci sono tante cose, varia scelta e con una buona colazione stai bene fino alle 14! stai a posto! c'è di tutto: salumi , dolci, succhi, pasticceria, tutto. è buona.
forse la cosa su cui avrei da ridire è la seguente: utilizzano delle tovagliette non monouso e questo lo trovo poco igienico a mio avviso. ci passano una pezzolina senza detersivi per pulire i tavoli e le tovagliette dalle briocioe,e finisce lì. questo uso non mi è piaciuto....devo essere sincera....
per il resto ok.
ai bambini fanno trovare dei lecca lecca sui letti all'arrivo , ma ne riforniscono ogni volta che fanno la camera. è una cosa simpatica!
ci ritornerei.",4,2019,02,18
60,Ottimo hotel,"Hotel centralissimo, avevamo prenotato una doppia e abbiamo avuto una tripla con balcone che affacciava sulla Rambla. Le camere sono ampie e pulitissime. Personale cortese e disponibile. Consiglio vivamente.",4,2019,02,17

60,Piacevole soggiorno,"Abbiamo soggiornato all’hotel oriente atiram l’ultimo weekend di gennaio, abbiamo chiesto una camera quadrupla viaggiando con due bambini. La camera molto spaziosa così come il bagno. Silenziosa nonostante l’affaccio sulla rambla. Ottima anche la pulizia e la colazione servita in una sala al primo piano. La posizione è fantastica, viaggiando con bambini era essenziale essere vicino al passeggio e ristoranti così da non dover prendere i mezzi pubblici la sera. Metropolitana a pochi passi e plaza de Catalunya a meno di un km (o una fermata di metro) con i collegamenti per l’aeroporto.",5,2019,02,05
60,El mejor personal que un huésped puede pedir,"Además de su excelente ubicación sobre las emblemáticas Ramblas de Barcelona, este hotel tiene el mejor personal, más amable y servicial que te hace sentir como en tu casa.

La posizione è fantastica, vicino alla metro Liceu e al mercato della Boqueria, ci si sposta facilmente anche di notte. Ci ritornerei!",4,2019,01,11
60,Soggiorno a Barcellona ,"Hotel molto valido soprattutto per la posizione strategica in piena Rambla da dove poter raggiungere facilmente ogni luogo di interesse (fermata metro linea 3 Liceu a pochi metri).
Camere forse un po' antiquate e rumorose (al piano basso). Nel complesso buon rapporto qualità/prezzo. Personale cortese e disponibile (con particolare menzione ad Emanuele alla reception). 
Sicuramente da tornare.",4,2019,01,06
60,tre giorni a Barcellona,"Siamo stati in questo Hotel a novembre e siamo molto soddisfatti di aver scelto l'Oriente Atiram in quanto in ottima posizione direttamente sulla  Rambla vicino a Plaza Catalunya, alla Cattedrale, a Plaza Real e quartiere gotico, al mercato della Bouqeria e non ultimo a 200 metri dalla fermata metro Liceu. Hotel storico con un fascino particolare  e nonostante l'età molto pulito e accogliente. Le camere pulite e spaziose con letti comodi. Prezzo conveniente rispetto ad hotels nella stessa zona e possibilità di lasciare i bagagli il giorno della partenza senza costi aggiuntivi. il personale é molto gentile e disponibile. L'unico appunto per noi italiani la mancanza di un canale televisivo italiano. Esperienza positiva e nel caso di ritorno a Barcellona   sceglierò questo hotel.",5,2018,11,29
60,Excelente ubicación y muy buena relación precio/calidad,Un acogedor hotel ubicado sobre la Rambla. El desayuno es muy completo y variado. Las instalaciones son muy agradables. El personal tiene muy buena disposición. Hay pequeños detalles que le dan cierto encanto en la atención. La relación precio-beneficios es muy buena considerando lo cara que se ha vuelto Barcelona. Lo único que no me gustó mucho fue la calidad del colchón. Somos más de colchones más firmes.,4,2018,11,15
60,Buena ubicación ,Lo mejor de este hotel es su ubicación. El personal que nos atendió fue correcto. La habitación que nos asignaron era muy pequeña. El colchón y las almohadas no nos resultaron para nada cómodas. La limpieza bastante bien. ,3,2018,11,04
60,Ottimo Hotel sulla Rambla...!!!,"Ottimo hotel 3 stelle lungo la Rambla e a pochi passi dal mercato St. Josep Bouqeria dove potete degustare i prodotti tipici di Barcellona. Hotel carino, molto pulito e per quanto mi riguarda camera molto funzionale (avendo avuto una bambina di 2 anni al seguito) con affaccio direttamente sulla Rambla. Staff molto gentile, cordiale e super disponibile; ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo considerando che l’hotel si trova praticamente nel punto più famoso e frequentato di Barcellona.",4,2018,10,28
60,Location strategica,"Hotel ubicato sulla Rambla quindi sicuramente in posizione strategica, nel complesso sufficiente senza infamia e senza lode, ottimo per la pulizia, arredo un po' anziano, materasso nella mia camera non era proprio un ultimo grido ma ne complesso ci ho dormito bene, colazione buona e ben fornita",3,2018,10,27
60,Soggiorno piacevole ,"Posizione dell’hotel comoda per visitare parecchi luoghi di interesse, colazione molto buona e camere confortevoli (uniche pecche: non sono dotate di mini bar e insonorizzazione non ottimale di alcune di esse, ma se i clienti fossero tutti educati, ciò non sarebbe un problema...!). Personale gentile sia alla reception (soprattutto Emanuele e Daniele), sia in sala colazione.  In generale, lo consigliamo!",4,2018,10,02
60,DISAGIO e MALEDUCAZIONE,"Una stella ma sarebbe ""0"".  Camera prenotata con Debit Card. Il giorno del mio arrivo ricevo una mail in cui dicono che la carta ha dato problemi e di contattare la struttura, in ogni caso la prenotazione sarebbe rimasta a mio nome per 48 ore. Contatto la struttura e notando che sarei arrivato in giornata, mi dicono che avrei pagato con tranquillità presso la struttura. Per stare più tranquillo, offro di dargli un'altra carta di credito al telefono ma declinano l'offerta dicendo che preferivano in Hotel. All'arrivo in Hotel alle 20.00 (Ritardo del volo), il ragazzo alla reception mi dice che stavano cercando un hotel per me e la mia ragazza perchè la nostra stanza l'hanno data via ed avevano cancellato la mia prenotazione. Mi sono alterato ed ho mostrato la email dove compariva che la prenotazione rimaneva valida per 48 ore e che erano stati loro a dirmi di voler risolvere presso la struttura. Mi ha risposto che le email sono automatiche ma in realtà non è vero e che la colpa era mia perche la carta non ha funzionato. Quindi oltre al danno arrecatomi, è stata incredibile la maleducazione con cui hanno preteso di aver ragione su un trattamento a mio parere vergognoso e disonesto. Mi hanno proposto diversi Hotel a costi più elevati e più distanti dalle mie zone di interesse. Avendomi lasciato alle 20.00 senza un luogo dove dormire, ho dovuto effettuare un'altra prenotazione per una struttura alternativa, ed essendo stata fatta per il giorno stesso del soggiorno ho pagato una fortuna per un Hotel, che già chiamarlo Hotel è un complimento. Se volete un disagio andateci. In alternativa vi consiglio DI EVITARE!!!",1,2018,10,01
60,Questo albergo ha di buono solo la posizione eccellente sulla Rambla.,"Ogni giorno mal di schiena per il letto poco comodo. Senza bidet, quando tornavamo in albergo la porta non si apriva perché la porta era guaata...così ogni giorno. Le luci fulminate. Albergo non buono",2,2018,09,12
60,Muy bien - excelente ubicación,"Fue una buena estadía de 5 días. Habitación adecuada, limpieza excelente, desayuno muy completo, personal muy atento y amable. La ubicación es única. El punto en contra, solicitamos servicio de lavado, el cual era con un valor elevado y no plancharon nada, sólo estaba la ropa doblada. En general un buen hotel",4,2018,09,05
60,Una scelta ottima,Hotel in ottima posizione e vicino ai luoghi di principale interesse. La metro è a due passi a piedi. Inoltre il personale è gentilissimo ed efficiente. La pulizia e l'ordine hanno reso il soggiorno ancora più rilassante. La stanza era ampia e confortevole. Per concludere lo consiglierei agli amici e terrò a mente il riferimento per un'ulteriore visita.,5,2018,08,28
60,Kurz Urlaub,"Die Lage des Hotel mitten in Ramblas ist super,ich kann das Hotel nur weiter empfehlen,
Zimmer großzügig und sauber , Personal ist sehr nett und hilfsbereit.

60,Pernottamento fantastico,"Abbiamo soggiornato in una bellissima camera con vista sulla Rambla, costantemente pulita ogni giorno. L'hotel tra l'altro si trova in un'ottima posizione, a pochi secondi dalla metro, e a un quarto d'ora dalla spiaggia di Barceloneta e da altre località importanti. La parte migliore è però stata l'assistenza della reception, sempre premurosa nel cercare di garantire la miglior permanenza possibile.

Manuel",5,2018,08,21
60,Vacanza di Agosto,"Buongiorno a tutti coloro che leggeranno questa mia personale recensione. Comincio con il dire che l'albergo è situato in una posizione strategica sulla Rambla il che non guasta per chi come me e mio figlio ha dovuto spostarsi a piedi. 
L'albergo è storico, per cui non aspettatevi camere confortevoli o di lusso, esse sono piccole,l'aria condizionata ha tre velocità e ""spinge"" di brutto. La notte infatti bisogna o spegnerla e posizionarla sulla velocità minima per evitare il congelamento.Le camere vengono rifatte giornalmente,ma ogni volta ho trovato capelli di donna sul letto...lasciamo perdere.
La mia recensione non riguarda la qualità di un albergo comunque di sole 3 stelle, è più profonda e riguarda una persona solamente, che mi permette di aggiungere, che se la qualità dell'albergo è nella media, non si può invece dire per il personale alla reception, altamente professionale e qualificato. Tra tutti ( e sono tanti ) una in particolare, un Signore con la S maiuscola di nome FERNAN RODRIGUEZ, ovviamente Spagnolo ( gli italiani non hanno per i connazionali la stessa identica disponibilità, anzi....). Ebbene non ho parole davvero per descrivere questa persona, se non con parole di encomio. E' gentilissimo, professionale, cordiale, preparato..gli aggettivi si sprecherebbero, ma sopra ogni cosa ha un CUORE enorme, capacità nel problem solving, sopra ogni altra figura a stipendio li dentro. Mi permetto di citarlo per la sua ENORME, UNICA, GRANDISSIMA capacità di capire e risolvere i problemi anche quelli ""muy fuerte""...A FERNAN RODRIGUEZ e solo ed esclusivamente a LUI che è stato ed è un gran Signore, dedico la recensione di questo albergo che meriterebbe essere frequentato solamente per la sua presenza !!! E' questa la professionalità che ci si deve attendere da un uomo, persona per la quale non esiterei un secondo ad assumere come DIRETTORE DEL PERSONALE della mia azienda. Spero che lo diventerà in quella struttura!!! 
GRAZIE davvero FERNAN RODRIGUEZ e mi auguro che chi leggerà questa recensione chieda di te per avere in hotel un punto di riferimento unico.

Si sente il traffico delle auto moto pullman ecc e anche il rumore delle persone che stanno nei ristoranti fuori all’aperto .
Consiglio per un corretto riposo o di assicurarsi di usare i tappi per orecchie la notte oppure farsi assegnare una camera ai piani alti che non si affacci sulla strada .
Ho prenotato una camera familiare e ho scelto una stanza all’apparenza grande ( era scritto nel sito dell’albergo  che le stanze di quella categoria erano molto spaziose).
Nella realtà mi hanno assegnato una stanza piccola nell’ala vecchia dell’albergo .
Ho chiesto il giorno dopo di cambiare stanza e sono stata accontentata ma la stanza in realtà era un po’ più grande ma nel bagno era privo del bidet.
La camera è risultata comunque pulita e il letto matrimoniale confortevole forse un po’ piccolo il divano letto dove hanno dormito mie figlie adolescenti.
Abbiamo soggiornato tre notti con la colazione servita al primo piano in una zona molto carina dell’albergo.
L a Qualità della colazione e ‘ nella media  con cibo internazionale e scelta varia di frutta affettati brioche e succhi di frutta vari. Cibo di qualità media tipico di un tre stelle.
Il personale dell’albergo simpatico e sorridente. 
Buon rapporto qualità prezzo e posizione buona per girare la città storica a piedi.",3,2018,04,29

60,Ottimo albergo,"La settimana scorsa i miei genitori sono tornati in Italia dopo aver soggiornato all'hotel Hatiram di Barcellona. Sono rimasti soddisfattissimi sia per l'albergo in sè, sia per la posizione centrale, ottima soprattutto per le persone che vogliono avere tutto a portata di mano. Oltre a questo, hanno gradito molto il ragazzo italiano alla reception che si è dimostrato con loro paziente e molto disponibile! Il rapporto qualità e prezzo c'è. Un buon albergo da consigliare!

Abbiamo prenotato due notti prendendo una camera con balcone vista rambla: meravigliosa. 
Posizione centralissima, in pieno rambla, a pochi metri dalla metro liceu e a due passi dal quartiere gotico. Personale impeccabile: hanno tenuto i bagagli oltre l orario del checkout e ci hanno addirittura ristampato dei biglietti aerei che avevamo dimenticato in italia.

Está ubicado en las ramblas cerca del Mercado de la Boqueria, la plaza Real, la Plaza de Cataluña y El Barrio Gótico. Los empleados de la recepción son muy amables y te ayudan en todo. Las habitaciones son amplias y confortables. A mi me tocó una habitación interior y no tuve problemas de ruido pues no daba a la calle. Todo muy limpio y decoración adecuada. El desayuno bufet era muy completo. Este hotel me encantó por la comodidad de poder caminar por el centro de la ciudad y estar en pleno centro. Hay una entrada de metro muy cerca también para poder desplazarte y visitar otros lugares de esta hermosa ciudad. Es un hotel muy recomendable.",5,2018,04,02

60,Bellissimo fine settimana nel cuore di Barcellona,"Siano stato in quest'albergo lo scorso fine settimana, scelto per la posizione, davvero ottimale si trova proprio sulle Rambla, davvero in posizione strategica per viaggiare Barcellona in pochi giorni con metropolitane, fermate autobus ad un passo e soprattutto sulla zona di passeggio migliore. Leggendo qualche recensione mi spaventava l'idea che fosse un po' rumoroso quindi non scomodo per riposare ed invece non ho avuto proprio di questi problemi. L'albergo non si presenta nuovissimo, ma molto funzionale e pulito. Un bravo particolare al personale della reception, doppiatori Manuele disponibile e garbato. ",5,2018,02,21

Nonostante fossimo in 5 lo spazio era adeguato e non soffocante, il personale disponibile e paziente con i bambini, la colazione offre una buona varietà di scelta: salato, dolce frutta e latticini.
All'arrivo in stanza abbiamo trovato biglietto di benvenuto ed anche un presente.
Se dovessi tornare a Barcellona sarebbe il primo posto dove verificherei disponibilità.",5,2018,02,02

60,Hotel fantastico,"Siamo stati in questo hotel per il week end del mio compleanno.

Noi eravamo nel cortile interno che dava sulla sala colazione. Hanno un attenzione al cliente stupefacente. Lo consiglio e ci tornerò sicuramente!!

60,Buono anche se..,"Hotel con ottima posizione direttamente sulla rambla, guadagna punti per la comodità dell' ubicazione e per la gentilezza del personale.
Camera decisamente piccola al 4^ piano con qualche pecca: mancanza di frigobar (negativissimo se fossimo a luglio) e forti odori di fogna provenienti dagli scarichi del bagno che il personale di reception ha prontamente risolto con prodotti appositi per sturare gli scarichi.
Wi-fi e pulizia ok.
Buono per una sistemazione mordi e fuggi nel pieno centro di Barcellona.",4,2018,01,23
60,Pessimo,"Albergo trasandato con arredi datati. Stanza occupata quasi completamente da un letto enorme inutile, puzza di scarico proveniente dal bagno nauseante e persistente anche dopo avere areato..
Colazione con ampia scelta ma di prodotti pessimi.
Nessun tipo di interesse per gli ospiti se non per incassare il pagamento al check out.",1,2018,01,19
60,Ottima posizione e buona struttura,"Direttamente sulla Rambla, ma non per questo rumoroso.
Personale molto gentile.
Camera (408) con affaccio interno eabbastanza grande così come il bagno (anche se cieco e senza bidet).
La nostra camera molto silenziosa ed il letto comodo.
Buona la pulizia, anche se migliorbile
Buona e varia la colazione, servita in un enorme locale molto bello.
Nel complesso un ottimo rapporto qualità/Prezzo.
Sicuramente consiglio.",4,2018,01,15
60,Excelente ubicación pero no tan a gusto en las habitaciones,"El hotel está en excelente ubicación en las Ramblas, una calle de Barcelona llena de vida, negocios, tiendas y personas a todas horas. Nos recibieron bien e incluso con regalito y mensaje personalizado en la habitación, pero la comodidad en la habitación no fue muy buena, pedimos dos camas dobles y nos dieron una y un sofá cama viejo e incomodo, la otra cama tampoco era muy cómoda y hacían falta almohadas o que pongan unas mejores ya que nunca dormimos muy bien, el baño correcto, pero lo peor es la falta de aislamiento acústico en las habitaciones. Se escuchan los ruidos de al lado impresionante, cada palabra que dicen o murmuran, cuando entran al baño, los pasas y las tuberías cada vez que alguien abre el agua o le jala al baño.

Lo recomiendo por ubicación para gente joven y el desayuno es bueno.",4,2018,01,12
60,Hotel  muy centrico,"El hotel estaba muy bien  ubicado,en el centro de la Rambla.La fachada del hotel es muy bonita.El personal de recepcion fue muy servicial y muy amable.Las habitaciones muy comodas y muy limpias.El desayuno es muy completo y el sitio donde se sirve es espectacular.",5,2018,01,09
60,Visita de finde ,"Íbamos a pasar el fin de semana de reyes , lo cogimos por su ubicación básicamente , en un principio no teníamos desayuno pero como el primer día nos resultaba más práctico decidimos desayunar en el hotel , fueron 12€ por persona pero mi mayor sorpresa fue al ver “su supuesto gran bufet” escaso , sin apenas productos , era el día de reyes y por no tener no tenían ni roscón 😓 se supone que cada día tiene un rincón específico ... nosotros coincidimos con el de día de Cataluña , simplemente habían puesto un trozo de fuet y poco más !! Con lo rica que es la gastronomía catalana!!! El café de máquina , horroroso con lo sencillo que es tener una simple cafetera y una jarra de leche , los zumos de bote y muy malos por cierto , volvemos a la misma , estás cobrando un dinero por un desayuno y ni se molestan en que sean cosas de calidad. 
Las habitaciones muy pequeñas pero nosotros no necesitábamos más ya que apenas pasamos por el hotel, la venta del baño no cerraba bien y los muelles del colchón se notaban al pasar simplemente la mano. 
Necesitas una pequeña actualización en general, se aprovechan de su ubicación cobran mucho para lo que dan de desayuno y el estado en el que están las habitaciones , para poder cobrar eso deberían mejorar en general . Hay muchas barreras arquitectónicas para gente con minusválida . 
Los recepcionistas muy amables eso sí. ",2,2018,01,08
60,Hotel tranquillo,"Ottimo hotel sulla Ramblas, nonostante l'ubicazione rimane sufficuentenente tranquillo 
La hall un po' retro'.Personale gentile e sempre sorridente.L'interni rinnovati puliti ampi con un bellissimo salone per la colazione con il tetto piramidale in vetro( plexiglas).Stanze ampie e pulire. Buona la colazione dolce/salato...consigliato",4,2018,01,06
60,Pessimo,"La nostra esperienza è stata veramente allucinante, brutta deludente a tratti quasi paradossale.. iniziamo dicendo che al nostro arrivo il 31 dicembre ci hanno assegnato una camera(121) a dir poco diroccata.. noi volevamo una quadrupla abbiamo avuto una topaia, divano letto sporco e scricchiolante.. figuratevi che i miei figli insieme nn potevano dormirci!! Ho prenotato su Booking e per la prima volta in assoluto L hotel nn ha rispecchiato la proposta del sito... anche come foto di quadrupla credo che sia di altro pianeta nn lo stesso dell atiram oriente hotel... non parliamo della colazione .. offensiva, solo un po’ di prosciutto, uova cornetti acqua ( rigorosamente di rubinetto) e succhi sfusi maleodoranti... nemmeno L ombra di uno yogurt .. torte, the ... per nn parlare del caffè... macchinetta con acqua sporca!!! Capitolo a parte la pulizia... nn sanno assolutamente cosa sia la pulizia e l igiene, a parte il fatto che là camere ci veniva pulita n l pomeriggio verso le 15,30 ovvero ci veniva richiesto di uscire per pulirla😡assurdo! Un giorno ho dovuto chiedere alla reception di far passare lo straccio e nel rifare i letti di stendere il lenzuolo di sotto perché veniva lasciato tutto scombinato!!! Ovvero sistemavano solo la coperta di sopra, asciugamani poi nn ne parliamo... mai cambiato. Mi sono sentita offesa dal trattamento che questa struttura riserva ai clienti di Booking, ho notato molta differenza anche di assegnazione camera, addirittura la nostra era accanto alla camera dello staff che già dalle 7 e 30 del mattino ci deliziava con schiamazzi vari ...senza pensare che li nel sottoscala dedicato ai clienti Booking c erano persone che dormivano..L unica e ripeto L unica cosa positiva è la posizione dell hotel! Dimenticavo... non è vero che ha la terrazza sulla Rambla.. solo d estate ,mi hanno detto mettono i tavolini in inverno sono in gestione del ristorante accanto sul quale stenderei un velo pietoso come cucina ( provato anche quello). Abbiamo richiesto alla reception la cena in camera con tanto di foglietto scritto da noi ( per facilitarli) alle 9,30 del mattino per averla alle 20 e udite udite... alle 19 del 31 dicembre mi rispondono che non possono fare servizio in camera.... imbarazzanti anche qui!!!!!!!!!insomma mi dispiace per Booking ma questa volta vi siete appoggiati ad una struttura che nn cura la vostra clientela come è giusto che sia !",1,2018,01,03
60,Muy bien!!!,"Ubicación EXCELENTE! A dos minutos de la estación del Metro Liceu . Personal muy amable y atentos, hasta regalito de bienvenida 🤗.Desayuno aceptable. 
Lo q no m gustó:Abrieron la puerta para limpiar en una ocasión mientras dormíamos 😐 y la llave para entrar dejó de funcionar en 3 ocasiones. Otra cosa es el aislante de ruido, al parecer no hay ninguno y se escucha hasta un estornudo del que esté en el cuarto d al lado, si tienes sueño ligero como yo es un problema. 
Con todo y eso volvería !! 🤗 ",4,2018,01,02
60,Natale Speciale ! ,"Hotel Consigliatissimo al centro di Barcellona, ottima posizione per raggiungere i maggior punti di interesse.la mia camera era al 4ºpiano su vista Rambla.

60,"Profesionalidad, belleza y cordialidad todo en una ubicacion exepcional  a bajo costo","Estuvimos en este hotel en las semanas del 2 al 7 de diciembre del 2017. 

Primero, la ubicación es simplemente excelente. Está en La rambla, pleno centro de Barcelona, entre dos estaciones de subte y cerca de todo lo que vale la pena ver. A pesar de ello, y teniendo en cuenta que se celebran bodas, cumpleaños y eventos varios, es tranquilo de noche.

Es un hotel señorial muy limpio. Nuestra habitación era cómoda y bonita, bien calefaccionada, con ventanas a un jardín. Baño con bañera.

La atención era muy esmerada y siempre con una sonrisa, amables y atentos. No te vigilan ni te preguntan constantemente de qué cuarto eres, como otros hoteles. Te sientes un poco como en casa.

 Muy buen servicio de wi-fi.

Desayuno buffet en un hermoso salón de techo en pirámide acristalada. El desayuno es muy variado, fresco y tiene un ""rincón"" especial en donde se presentan pequeñas variedades aparte del desayuno habitual. La atención de los mozos muy buena y muy esmerado trabajo del (suponemos ) jefe de mozos (además, muy guapo, lo cual ayuda a disfrutar del desayuno).

Ninguna crítica negativa. La relación calidad precio es muy buena para un hotel así. 

Muy recomendable.",5,2017,12,20
60,En medio de la Rambla ,"La situación es inmejorable, nos dieron una habitación con vistas a la Rambla, el ruido sólo  se sentía un poco por la noche, poco molestado, casi  inaudible.

ristorante per la prima colazione con menù non molto vario ma buono

personale alla reception  molto valido , sempre con il sorriso e disponibile in tutto ( informazioni ect. ) , Ad esempio la prima sera ho segnalato un banale problema con il letto .... l' indomani subito risolto

60,Balcón sobre La Rambla,"Se trata de un hotel de tres estrellas  con una perfecta ubicación sobre La Rambla y por lo tanto rodeado de tiendas, bares, restaurantes y cerca de todos los sitios de interés en la bellísima ciudad de Barcelona.
Debe tenerse en cuenta que el edificio es un poco viejo y por lo tanto no puede competir con hoteles modernos pero las habitaciones son cómodas y el descanso es bueno, son de resaltar las habitaciones que tienen un balcón que da a La Rambla lo cual es un plus indiscutible.
Puntos en contra serían las limitaciones en la oferta para el desayuno el cual no contiene casi vegetales así como el aire acondicionado en la habitación que solo permitía las opciones encendido y apagado.  Además la romana que se encuentra en el primer piso y que sirve para pesar las valijas (pagando un euro por cada uso) marcaba un peso equivocado (casi 4 kilos más).
La atención del personal es muy amable y el wi fi sin costo adicional tiene buena cobertura en todo el hotel.",3,2017,07,09
60,Posizione eccellente,"Hotel pulito, profumato e ordinato. Caratteristiche non troppo comuni in Barcellona se non si vuole spendere una fortuna... oltre a questo situato in un ottima posizione per visitare i Luoghi di maggiore interesse e la spiaggia. Personale gentile.
Il prezzo non è stato economico, però si paga volentieri vista l'estrema comodità.
Consigliato",4,2017,06,27

Los colchones de las dos camas son viejos y muy incómodos, se hunden mucho y se sienten todos los resortes.
No se puede ajustar la temperatura del aire acondicionado, solo encenderlo y apagarlo con un viejo panel de plástico en la pared.
La ducha no tiene puerta, menos de la mitad, entonces se moja todo el baño, y el piso de la ducha está agrietado.
Los muebles están viejos y desgastados.",2,2017,06,04

60,Ottima posizione,"Hotel in ottima posizione, situato sulla Rambla, la via principale di Barcellona. Ho soggiornato all'Oriente Atiram agli inizi di Marzo con alcuni amici, siamo stati benissimo, le stanze sono spaziose e pulite. Il personale è cordiale e nessuna difficoltà con l'italiano. L'unica nota negativa è che durante la nostra permanenza uno di noi compiva gli anni e nonostante io abbia chiesto di fare in modo di fargli trovare una sorpresa in camera, non hanno fatto nulla.",4,2017,05,04
60,Soggiorno sulla Rambla,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel nell'ottobre 2016 insieme ad alcuni miei amici.La posizione della struttura è strategicamente perfetta : si trova sulla Rambla (probabilmente la via più famosa di Barcellona) e a pochi passi si puo trovare la fermata della metropolitana; trovandosi sulla Rambla la struttura è circondata da ristoranti,locali e negozi. Il personale è stato molto cordiale cercando di parlare addirittura l'italiano(lingua sconosciuta all'estero). Le camere sono spaziose al punto giusto e sono inoltre molto pulite e dotate di un'ottima connessione wifi gratuita per i clienti dell'hotel. I pasti vengono consumati in una sala molto sugestiva e particolare che mescola architettura moderna e antica. Consiglio vivamente l'Oriente Atiram se si vuole vivere lo spirito della capitale della Catalogna .
Unica nota negativa (forse) , non mi aspettavo un degrado simile nei confronti dei giovani : ogni secondo in pieno centro sulla Rambla si è fermati da qualche persona che vuole trasportarti in qualche locale a luci rosse, o peggio venderti droga .....
P.S. appena superato l'hotel si puo trovare una stazione della polizia quindi si puo dormire a sonni tranquilli .",4,2017,04,29
60,"Gentilezza, posizione e praticità","Con un piccolo gruppo di amiche ho trascorso qui 3 giorni in marzo: esperienza positiva soprattutto per posizione e praticità, per l'accoglienza in Reception in particolare con Emanuele valido e gentilissimo riferimento anche per noi italiani, e per l'ottima colazione in una grande e piacevole sala centrale.

Lugar: Amplio, muy agradable, limpio. 
Desayuno: Muy bueno! con mucha variedad. Un día nos dieron un formulario para poner sugerencias sobre el desayuno, pusimos que seria bueno que pongan mermelada de frutilla y al día siguiente nos cumplieron el capricho, un gesto muy lindo. Hay de todo, desde panes, fiambres, cosas para hacer sandwiches, muffins, mucha variedad.

En verdad es un lugar muy cómodo para pasar en familia o con amigos. Muy buena la atención de la recepción.",4,2017,04,23

La acogida, por una plantilla muy amable y atenta a todas las solicitudes de los clientes, es excelente.
¡Por la mañana, el desayuno buffet en una sala cuyo techo es una gran cristalera que deja ver el cielo es un momento muy agradable que bien quisiéramos prolongar!
¡En resumidas cuentas, un Oriente precioso!",5,2017,04,20

60,Posizione perfetta!,"Ho avuto modo di soggiornare in questo 
hotel per 3 notti in una camera tripla,che dire...niente di speciale diciamo che dalle foto delle camere sia su TripAdvisor che su booking mi aspettavo qualcosa in più!!
Note positive la pulizia e il bagno ampio,wifi presente con segnale piuttosto buono e la chicca è la posizione perfetta sulla Rambla,a due passi dalla metro e facendo una passeggiata di 20 minuti circa si arriva alla spiaggia!
Non ho usufruito del pacchetto colazione perchè a 5 minuti si trova il mercato la Boqueria e con una spesa di 3/4€ mangi.
Se dovessi tornare a Barcellona probabilmente soggiornerei ancora qui.
Personale cordiale ",3,2017,04,16
60,Ottima Esperienza,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questa struttura dal 1 al 5 aprile 2017,a cavallo del compleanno della mia ragazza, 
La posizione è strategica: ingresso dell'Hotel sulla Rambla, a 50m dalla fermata metro Liceu.
Il livello dell'Hotel è alto, le camere sono pulite e il personale è molto gentile, si può parlare in italiano e c'è personale alla reception di nazionalità italiana.
E' vero che il segnale wi-fi non è il massimo... ma noi stavamo in stanza solo per dormire e non ci è mai servito... 
Il rapporto qualità/prezzo è alto, abbiamo usufruito del trattamento di solo pernottamento senza colazione.Il giorno del compleanno della mia ragazza, le hanno fatto trovare in stanza un simpatico pensierino e un biglietto di auguri...

Al momento della prenotazione (telefonica con pagamento anticipato) siamo stati assistiti da Emanuele, il quale ci ha guidati durante tutta la nostra permanenza fornendoci consigli sulle visite turistiche e sui ristoranti da frequentare.
A Emanuele rinnoviamo i nostri ringraziamenti !!

Un punto negativo es que en un par de oportunidades observé que el personal que se encarga de la limpieza de las habitaciones no respeta el horario de descanso de los huéspedes ya que recorren los pasillos hablando fuerte. Esto sucedió entre las 7 y las 8 de la mañana.",4,2017,03,13
60,Muy buena ubicación,"He estado en este hotel unas 4 veces, y la verdad que la ubicación genial este justo en medio de las ramblas aunque el desayuno no esta muy bien para mi gusto, pero el salir al balcón y estar viendo el ritmo fluida de las ramblas es genial.
Las habitaciones son normalitas, están bien aunque lo mejor seria escoger las que dan a las ramblas y no al callejón del costado, es un hotel frecuentado desde mi punto de vista por viajes escolares tres de las veces que he ido estaba lleno de grupos de institutos de España, Italia, Grecia, Por lo que si eres joven esta bien.
El trato del personal esta bien pero nada del otro mundo aún así recomiendo ir si eres una persona joven con ganas de pasarlo bien donde conocer gente de tu edad",4,2017,02,28

Hatten ein Familienzimmer (1 Doppelbett, 1 Bettsofa) und nur zum Schlafen/sich frisch machen genügte es vollkommen. Sehr grosses & sauberes WC. Haben zusätzlich Frühstück genommen, das Buffet bietet für alle was an. Ich dachte zuerst, dass es voll lärmig ist (in Mitten der Ramblas) jedoch hatten wir Glück und das Zimmer befand sich gegen den Hinterhof. Wie es bei den anderen Zimmern ist kann ich nicht beurteilen. Ich würde auf jeden Fall wieder buchen und weiterempfehlen. Die Lage ist grandios. ",5,2017,02,15

Situato su La Rambla, la sua posizione permette di raggiungere, facilmente e comodamente, sia il porto che i quartieri storici del Barrìo Gotico e del Raval.
Buono anche lo stato della struttura, con camere abbastanza moderne e ben tenute, anche se non in tutte è presente il bidet.
Da rivedere la pulizia: oltre a rifare il letto e cambio di asciugamani nel bagno, il resto lasciava a desiderare. In un soggiorno di sei notti, non hanno mai spazzato a terra. Per di più, le pulizie avvenivano con ""molto comodo"". Più di una volta, infatti, ci è capitato di rientrare a ora di pranzo (tra l'una e le due), e la stanza era ancora da sistemare.
Personale nel complesso disponibile, anche se, in qualche rara circostanza, ci hanno ignorato, facendoci attendere più del dovuto. 
Un'ultima pecca, almeno nella nostra esperienza, sono state le carte per aprire la stanza. Praticamente ogni giorno, si smagnetizzavano e non funzionavano più. Bisognava scendere nella hall e chiedere di risolvere il problema. Per carità, nulla di trascendentale, ma sicuramente una scocciatura.",3,2016,08,03

Además el personal de recepción es agradable, comunicativo y eficaz. Las habitaciones, amplias y espaciosas podrían estar mejor amuebladas, pero cumplen a la perfección. Si quieres un buen descanso utiliza este hotel, que además está a un paso de la zona más hermosa de Barcelona, y en nuestro caso del Gran Teatro Liceo.

Ma i problemi si sono ripetuti. Colazione livello base. Nel complesso un hotel valido con alcune pecche. ",3,2016,07,15
60,Muy bueno!!,"Llegamos tarde y el check-in fue muy rápido. La atención fue fantástica. Teníamos asignada una habitación pero como quería vista a la rambla, me la cambiaron. No me tocó con vista a la rambla, pero si a la calle lateral e igual estaba muy bien. La habitación era grande. No tenía frigobar y tenía caja de seguridad con tarjeta de crédito. El baño tenía amenities. Esta muy pero muy bien ubicado, muy cerca de todo, un lujo! El desayuno es variado y suficiente.

60,""" Posizione strategica....","Abbiamo alloggiato in questo Hotel tre notti e ci siamo trovati benissimo.
La nostra camera anche se piccola ci e' piaciuta molto soprattutto perché affacciava sulla Ramblas (scelta molto personale che noi peraltro abbiamo richiesto ,probabilmente non consigliabile a chi ama la tranquillita') ed era sempre perfettamente
pulita con cambio giornaliero . Una piccola pecca della colazione che era comunque abbondante,  avrei preferito le marmellate e i succhi freschi piuttosto che industriali, ma vicinissimo c'e' il mercato de La Boqueria ...da non perdere. Il personale molto cortese e simpatico, la metropolitana Liceu vicinissima per cui spostamenti veloci ,inoltre dalla Ramblas a piedi per i vicoli ....si ha proprio la sensazione di essere nel cuore palpitante della citta'.",4,2016,07,06
60,Bella la posizione ma il resto un po' sotto le aspettative,"L'albergo si trova in una bellissima posizione, ideale per chi vuole visitare tutti i luoghi più interessanti della città, ma l'interno della stanza è stato al disotto delle aspettative.

Prima colazione molto buona e abbondante.",3,2016,07,04
60,Will come again,"Alles bestens, nur das Bett nicht: Die Matratze war durch-gelegen, die Federung defekt. Das Schlafen war nur bedingt möglich, da bei jeder Bewegung laute Geräusche entstanden.

Il personale è molto cortese ma non parla italiano (però ci si riesce a capire lo stesso). Lo consiglio soprattutto per la posizione sulla Rambla e vicinissimo al Mercato",4,2016,06,16

Recomiendo este hotel!!",5,2016,06,09
60,VOLVÍ Y NOTE CAMBIOS,"La verdad es que sigue siendo el lugar apropiado para alojarse en BCN. Lamentablemente al llegar la recepciónista que nos atendió nos trató muy mal diciendo que no estaba pago el alojamiento.  Eso originó una discusión que obviamente no fue agradable pero pedimos hablar con la gerente al día siguiente para expresar nuestra queja. No sólo se disculpó por el momento que pasamos sino que por la noche envió a modo de disculpas tres botellas de champaña y una canasta con fresas. Un detalle maravilloso de su parte. Esta vez reservé con desayuno porque el costo era 3 € y medio menos que el año pasado y me sorprendió la categoría del desayuno buffet y la atención del personal.  Sigue siendo para mi el lugar para alojarme en Barcelona. a 200 mts de la estación de metro a 700 de la Plaza Catalunya, a 10 cuadras del barrio gotico y a tres del mercado de la boqueria. El hecho es que fuera de esa recepcionista el resto del personal es maravilloso. Y sin duda volveré al estar en Barcelona, ya me siento como en casa.",5,2016,06,08

Molte le cose da vedere nelle aree adiacenti e la possibilità di usufruire della Metropolitana che ha la fermata a due passi. Buono il servizio con personale simpatico e preparato.

Personale disponibile, stanze  sempre pulite. Non abbiamo usufruito della colazione.

Personale disponibile, stanze senza pretese ma sempre pulite. Non abbiamo usufruito della colazione ma sicuramente la zona adibita alla colazione e' di effetto con una copertura a piramide che ti permette di vedere l'esterno.

60,Super Lage mit kleineren Mängeln,"Wir waren im Frreundeskreis für zwei Nächte im Hotel Oriente. Das Hotel liegt direkt an den Ramblas, ca. 200 Meter von den Markthallen entfernt.
Bei Ankunft wurden wir an der Rezeption sehr freundlich empfangen, die Zimmer zum Innenhof waren auf dem ersten Blick ansprechend und sauber.
Leider haben Kleinigkeiten den positiven Gesamteindruck etwas geschmälert. Im Bad gab es weder Toilettenbürste noch eine Vorrichtung zum Aufhängen des Duschkopfes. Die Zimmer sind auch etwas hellhörig.
Das Frühstück war nicht gut.
Für einen Kurzaufenthalt im Stadtzentrum insgesamt geeignet.",3,2016,03,27

60,Orientale...,"Ho soggiornato durante il periodo della Fiera MWC il mese scorso. L'ambiente è tipicamente ""orientale"" (da cui prende il nome). È frequentato maggiormente da persone orientali, idem per i dipendenti. Ritornando all'albergo, nulla da dire sulla pulizia, colazione ottima (dimenticate anche qui il caffè italiano ;) .  La posizione è PERFETTA per girare l'intera città visto che è a due passi dalla fermata della metro Liceu. Per il resto siete sulla Rambla = tutto intorno a voi. Ps. Vi suggerisco di chiedere la stanza con balcone sulla Rambla (molto più caratteristico che affacciare all'interno dell'edificio.  ",3,2016,03,20
60,Excelente experincia en familia!,"Fuimos en familia, con nuestros hijos de 10 y 6 años. La ubicación sobre las ramblas para acceder al metro que está a pocas cuadras o para ir a caminar hasta el puerto, o al barrio gótico, la catedral, la plaza del rey, es excelente. El mercado de la boquería a pocas cuadras un imperdible para tomar riquísimos jugos naturales . Hay variados lugares para comer alrededor, desde restaurantes típicos de comida española hasta económicos fast foods como kentucky o mc donalds, solo cruzando la calle. También hay un carrefour a dos cuadras para comprar algo para llevar en los paseos, con horario amplio. Si quiere hacer compras están cerca las tiendas del corte inglés, zara y muchas otras. 
Dejando el tema ubicación, la atención del personal del hotel fue excelente. Nuestra hija de 6 años se tropezó en la calle y se raspó el mentón. Llegamos al hotel caminando desde el puerto y enseguida nos facilitaron los elementos para atenderla y se preocuparon hasta que nuestro seguro médico nos indicó la clínica a la que debíamos dirigirnos. Luego estuvieron siempre muy atentos consultando por la evolución de la niña. 
Las habitaciones son amplias y las mantienen en excelente estado de limpieza. 
El internet wi fi funcionó siempre muy bien.

60,Kurztrip,"Das Hotel Oriente sticht vor allem durch seine Lage hervor. Wir hatten ein Zimmer Richtung Innenhof, was für uns absolut ok war. Es war ruhig und vom Treiben auf den Ramblas war quasi nichts zu hören. 4 Nächte waren wir im Oriente und müssen folgendes bemängeln.

Leider ist auch nur die Lage eine Rechtfertigung für den doch hohen Übernachtungspreis. Die Betten bzw. die Matratzen hatten ihre besten Tage schon länger hinter sich. So ist der schlaf nicht sehr erholsam gewesen und man hatte leichte Rückenschmerzen nach dem Schlafen. Zudem wurde bei der Reinigung nicht sonderlich auf die Hygiene im Bad Acht gegeben. Zahnputzbecher wurden nicht gewechselt, das Waschbecken nicht ausgespült und die Duschwand hatte die selben Wischspuren wie beim Ankommen. 

Nichts desto trotz, ist die Lage perfekt um ein paar tolle Tage Barcelona zu haben. Wer das Zimmer nur fürs schlafen und bei der Sauberkeit im Bad Abstriche machen kann, sollte bei der Wahl des Hotels das Orient unbedingt berücksichtigen. Auch wir werden bei einem erneutem Barcelona Besuch dies tun. ",3,2016,03,15

------------------------

Ausführlich

Wir haben zu zweit für 5 Nächte im Atiram Oriente in einem La Rambla Room übernachtet.
Die Freundlichkeit des Personals an der Rezeption, die ständige Hilfsbereitschaft (Infos bezüglich Transport, Nachtleben, Fahrräder verstauen, etc.) waren der große Pluspunkt genauso wie der gute Zimmerservice.
Ansonsten ist die Lage direkt am Geschehen und man kommt überall sofort und schnell hin. Die Aussicht vom Balkon hat ihren Reiz, aber man muss sich fragen, ob man auch nach einem anstrengenden Tag weiterhin dem wilden Touri-Treiben und entsprechender Lautstärke aussetzen möchte.

Nach der freundlichen Begrüßung von der Hotelrezeption suchten wir unser Zimmer auf und wurden von einem muffigen und ekligen Gestank empfangen, der aus dem Bad kam und auch in den nächsten Tagen nicht verschwand, sodass wir die Badtür stets geschlossen hielten, um das Ganze in Grenzen zu halten, was die Sache aber auch nicht viel besser machte.
Die größte Enttäuschung war für uns das mitgebuchte Frühstück. Wir hatten durch lesen von Rezensionen schon eine leise Vorahnung bekommen, aber es war fast noch schlimmer. Die Auswahl ist nicht groß, würde jedoch ausreichen, wenn irgendein Standard von Qualität eingehalten werden würde. Das ist leider nicht der Fall gewesen und genauso lieblos zubereitet wie die Stimmung des Personals und des kalten Saals, der seiner ursprünglichen Schönheit beraubt wurde.

Es ist uns neu, dass man am Anreisetag Frühstück bezahlt, das nur bis 11 geht, jedoch Checkin erst ab 15 Uhr möglich ist und ab Tag der abreise kein Frühstück erhält. Eine intelligente Optimierungs- und Verkaufsstrategie, die als Kunde nicht nachvollziehbar ist und aus unserer Sicht eine Frechheit ist.

Fazit:
Länger als 2 Nächte sollte man sich dieses Hotel nicht antun. Es ist gerade so okay für einen kurzen Städtetrip, aber nicht über mehrere Tage.
Der Preis  (330 Euro für Zwei Personen und 5 Nächte inklusive Frühstück) ist für diese Lage in Ordnung. Der Standard wird aber den 3 Sternen in wichtigen Punkten einfach nicht gerecht.
Einmal hat gereicht. Trotzdem bedanken wir uns bei dem Personal, jedoch nicht bei der Hotelführung.",2,2016,01,26

60,Ottima vacanza all'albergo Atiram Oriente a Barcellona,"L'albergo si trova in una ottima posizione nel centro vecchio della città  vicino alla fermata della metropolitana '' Liceu' e con una breve passeggiata ti trovi nella zona del porto. Il viale da percorrere fino al porto, viale Rambas è meraviglioso, pieno di vita , di artisti, di negozi, si può ammirare il Teatro Principal come si può andare anche al Mercato Boqueria ( 5 munuti a piedi dall'albergo).Sulle strade intorno all'albergo si può camminare fino alla Cattedrale di Barcellona, cosi come si possono ammirare le costruzioni vecchie di questa parte de la città.La zona è molto pulita e la gente è cortese.
Allontanarsi dall'albergo con la Metro ti puoi spostare in tutte le parte della città, (la metro funzione molto bene ed è pulita) sia per andare ad ammirare le opere del grande architetto Gaudi sia per andare al funicolare Montjuc oppure andare semplicemente a vedere tutti gli angoli della città.

60,Barcellona tutto ok!,"Hotel sulla Rambla , ottima posizione. Si trova a 1 minuto dalla metro Liceu , la metro è comodissima per spostarsi in tutta la città ed anche per l'aeroporto. Sotto l'hotel passa la metro , ma quando arrivi da una giornata di visita della città si è tanto stanchi e non senti più niente. Il personale della reception è molto disponibile e competente. Ritornerò sicuramente. Ho proprio trascorso quattro giorni spendidi .  ",4,2016,01,05
60,Ottima posizione ,L'hotel si trova proprio sulla Rambla e a 50 metri da una stazione della metropolitana. Personale un po' schivo e camere molto spartane. Nonostante avessimo chiesto il letto matrimoniale ci è stata assegnata una camera doppia con letti separati. Nel complesso siamo rimasti soddisfatti perché le camere erano pulite e c'era tutto l'essenza le per un breve soggiorno.,3,2016,01,02

60,Malos modales,"Dice el dicho que ""si te acuestas con ninios, es probable que amanezcas mojado"". Eso fue lo que sucedio. Todo iba relativamente bien hasta que a las 12,20hs del dia del check out la recepcionista llama a la habitacion diciendo ""son las 12, 20hs y el check out es a las 12hs. Necesitamos que deje su habitacion""......

Al momento del check out y preguntar por un gerente o director, las responsabilidades de la gestion del establecimiento recaian en un joven de no mas de 25 anios y una joven, Srta. Rosa segun sus palabras, de la misma edad. 

Ante mi inquietud por el desatino en cuanto a las formas, su respuesta fue que de la misma manera se lo habia hecho notar a otra habitacion, como si eso fuera justificativo a su proceder. Este hecho no solo demuestra que la Srta Rosa no conoce de atencion al cliente sino que carece de la mas minima educacion. 

Ante hechos asi no dan ningunas ganas de retornar a ese hotel. Barcelona tiene suficiente oferta. Esto ocurrio el 20 de Diciembre de 2015.",2,2015,12,26

60,Ottima posizione e buon prezzo,"Hotel in stile retrò molto caratteristico, scale e pavimenti in marmo sulla Ramblas. Pulito, letti comodi, bagno ben strutturato.

Nos dieron una triple en lugar de una doble, nos dijeron que nos la cambiarían pero al final no nos cambiaron nada. Personal amable y correcto. Recientemente han restaurado el edificio y se han cargado las esculturas que decoraban el dintel. Una auténtica chapuza en un edificio del siglo XIX.

      ",4,2015,11,01
60,Punto di forza la posizione,"Soggiornato presso l’oriente Aritam Hotel di Barcellona con la famiglia composta da 4 persone dal 24 al 27 ottobre 2015.
Grande struttura situata proprio sulla Rambla a pochi passi dal mercado de la  Boqueria, praticamente nel centro storico di Barcellona, questo avvalora la scelta dell’hotel proprio per la sua posizione – andavamo in zona  Barceloneta sulla spiaggia, rientravamo a riposare in hotel, oppure a fare un giro per negozi sulla Passeig de Gracia o nel centro storico, tutto a pochi passi con la possibilità di rientrare in Hotel in breve tempo e senza utilizzare i mezzi di trasporto.
Questa struttura è un palazzo antico,  mobilia datata, letti che a volte “cigolano”, la camera posizionata sul retro della Rambla è più silenziosa, anche se però bisogna avere la fortuna di non confinare con ospiti dell’hotel che fanno rumori, le pareti lasciano passare ogni tipo di suono – buona però la pulizia della camera. La colazione per 4 persone costava 52 euro, nelle vie trasversali dalla Rambla ci sono dei cafè, noi andavano in via Carrer de Ferran  in faccia l’hotel a 70 metri dalla Rambla, con 15/20 euro colazione fatta. Tutto sommato bella esperienza, anche se non a buon mercato e in linea con altre strutture, consiglio questo hotel per un breve soggiorno a Barcellona, la locazione è praticamente fantastica.
Un consiglio per chi dall’aeroporto si reca in hotel e viceversa – noi abbiamo preso un taxi pagando 44 euro (dal tachimetro aggiunto anche costi valige e tasse) – consiglio di prendere gli Aerobus a Euro 5.90 a persona, molto più convenienti, ultima fermata dove scendere placa de Catalunya, hotel a 500/600 metri.",3,2015,10,28
60,Ottima scelta,"Hotel collocato in posizione centrale...vicino a molti luoghi di interesse e a due passi dalla metro.
Silenzioso e pulito. Personale gentile e disponibile.
Recepion aperta 24 ore.
 Prezzi un po'  alti ma ne vale la pena, lo consiglio. ",4,2015,10,22
60,Excelente atencion.,"El hotel esta en una excelente  ubicacion, el desayuno es abundante, la atencion del personal muy cordial, siempre a disposicion, muy buena conexion de internet. Es una zona muy bonita y esta cerca de todo.",5,2015,10,20
60,Esperienza positiva,"Personale disponibilissimo e davvero cortese (mi hanno aiutata tantissimo purtroppo quando mi sono sentita male l'ultimo giorno).Pulizia giornaliera della camera e posto centralissimo. Lo consiglio a tutti! Ovviamente essendo in piena Rambla la sera ci sarà ""casino"" fino a tardi...ma è un aspetto che avevo già messo in conto prima di partire. Fantastiche le caramelle e l'acqua che ti danno appena arrivi.
      
      ",5,2015,10,14
60,Rumoroso,"La struttura si trova sulla Rambla, in pieno centro, nella città vecchia a due passi dalla fermata del metro Liceu. L'edificio è datato ma in buone condizioni, gli interni sono ben tenuti e le camere sono abbastanza confortevoli.
La nota negativa è il rumore nella camera: abbiamo scelto una camera deluxe sperando in una sistemazione migliore, invece abbiamo scoperto che queste camere si affacciano sulla Rambla, quindi godono di una vista migliore ma sono rumorose. Se poi, come è capitato a noi, vi assegnano una camera al primo piano ad ogni passaggio della metropolitana sembra ci sia un terremoto. Ci siamo lamentati e ci hanno dato una camera all'ultimo piano, peggio !! tutta la notte si sentiva il  rumore di un motore/compressore. Insomma qualità del sonno zero, il resto (posizione, pulizia, camera, etc) buono.",3,2015,10,08
60,EXCELENTE ESTANCIA!! PARA REPETIR!!,"Es un Hotel muy acogedor, en el centro neurálgico de BCN, en una de las arterias principales de la ciudad (Las Ramblas), ideal para visitar el centro, el barrio gótico, el puerto, con parada de metro a pocos metros para poder desplazarse a otros puntos. Hay muchos restaurantes y lugares de interés alrededor. 
El personal del hotel con un trato exquisito te ayuda en cualquier cosa que necesites, especialmente el equipo de recepción.
Nos ha tocado habitación exterior que da a la calle de las Ramblas y las habitaciones están muy bien insonorizadas en las que no se escucha ruido del exterior, las camas comodísimas!! y detalles en la habitación que marcan la diferencia con otros hoteles, entre ellos destacar un mensaje de bienvenida en el espejo de baño de la camarera de pisos. 
El desayuno buffet se sirve en una sala muy luminosa con techo de cristal que llama la atención, cabe destacar un desayuno muy variado, muy bueno y bien organizado.
Volveré sin dudarlo!!",5,2015,10,06
60,Buon hotel in ottima posizione,"Stato in coppia con mia moglie per tre giorni e due notti in questo hotel prenotato all'ultimo. Scelto per la posizione e per l'offerta trovata molto interessante rispetto alla concorrenza. Confermo quello detto da altri visitatori, Facciata esterna molto particolare e bella, interno pulito curato ma meno d'effetto rispetto all'esterno. Personale molto cortese e disponibile. La nostra camera era al 4° piano con due ascensori per arrivarci, quindi non bisogna aspettare molto anche se l'hotel aveva molti ospiti in quel periodo.
Camera matrimoniale con letti singoli affiancati, molto funzionale pulita, con armadio e bagno spaziosi. L'unica cosa era la posizione della finestra che dava all'interno su un muro ma onestamente non era fondamentale per noi la vista ma la pulizia e comodità dell'hotel. Camera con cassaforte, tv e aria condizionata che si poteva regolare a piacimento. Cambio biancheria ogni giorno. Non posso dire niente sulla colazione poiché non abbiamo usufruito di questo servizio. Posizione sulla Ramblas comodissimi per visitare Barcellona sia a piede che in metrò con fermata a due passi dell'hotel. Non posso fare altro che consigliare l'alloggio in questa struttura.",4,2015,10,05
60,Excelente estadía!,"Estuvimos cerca de 4 días. El hotel es muy bonito, las habitaciones cómodas tamaño normal no lujosa. Tienen detalles bonitos con sus clientes. SIempre limpio. El desayuno que ofrece es bastante atractivo. La ubicación es perfecta, en Las Ramblas donde está muy ambientado, y encuentra bares, restaurantes y tiendas de souvenirs, un supermercado muy cerca.
Su personal, muy servicial,Fabiola la que trabaja en el front desk siempre nos trató de ayudar muy amablemente. Lo recomiendo!",5,2015,10,01
60,Buon hotel in pienissimo centro di Barcellona,"Due sono le caratteristiche migliori dell'hotel Atiram Oriente : La facciata storica dell'hotel..meravigliosa trasuda storicità' e ovviamente la sua posizione in piena rambla.
Detto questo analizziamo l'hotel...l'entrata con la reception non è' delle migliori..un po' vecchiotta ma a differenza della sua facciata esterna non propriamente affascinate..
Personale gentile e carino...
Camera per due persone  di buone dimensioni abbastanza basic ma funzionale..bagno di buone dimensioni.
Colazione ottimo buffet sia dolce che salato..molto valida.ll
Pulizia nelle camere buona..camera sempre pulita con cambio giornaliero degli asciugamani..acqua sempre calda.
Prezzo decisamente interessante .
La posizione consente di spostarsi agevolmente sia a piedi che in metro ( a due passi dall'hotel) per tutta Barcellona..vicinissimo il mercato centrale...
Insomma Consigliatissimo...sicuramente riutilizzerò l'Oriente Atiram la mia prossima visita a Barcellona.",4,2015,09,17
60,Una settimana a barcellona,"Ho alloggiato in questo hotel con una mia amica dal 13 al 19 agosto.
L'hotel è situato in un'ottima posizione, poiché è proprio sulla rambla e comodo per tornare a qualunque ora ed è molto pulito. 
Gli asciugamani erano cambiati giornalmente, come pure venivano aspirati i capelli sul pavimento e riforniti i prodotti per il bagno.
L'unica pecca la dimensione delle stanze, che sinceramente per due persone era davvero piccola, non ci stavano nemmeno le valigie.
Il personale abbastanza cortese, tranne una signorina, mi hanno accolto e servito con gentilezza. Il noleggio bici non esiste, a differenza di quanto scritto su expedia.
Non ho usufruito della colazione, in quanto a pochi passi c'è il famoso mercato che offre frutta fresca e frullati.
Per andare a barcelloneta, in spiaggia, consiglio il taxi, con 5€ si arriva, specialmente se siete più di 2 persone, perché il noleggio bici si aggira intorno ai 10€ giornalieri e se non si gira anche la città, non ne vale la pena.
In ogni caso Barcellona è una delle città che adoro ed è stata una splendida vacanza",3,2015,09,12
60,Centrale ma un po' retrò,"La posizione dell'albergo è centralissima, proprio al centro della Rambla, ma la hall ha un cattivo odore ed è retrodatata...Il personale è abbastanza gentile e le stanze sono abbastanza pulite e comode. Lo consiglio per un soggiorno breve.",4,2015,09,10
60,Ottima posizione e ottimi confort!! ,"Come già detto la posizione è ottimale, proprio sulla rambla ad un passo dalla stazione metro di liceu a due passi da plaça catalunya e vicinissima al mare. Camere a dir poco spaziose, carine e pulite. Confort di tutti i generi, dal wi-fi gratuito alla cassaforte in camera, aria condizionata e bagno davvero spazioso!! Se proprio vogliamo fare un piccolo appunto, beh.... I ragazzi della reception potrebbero essere un po' più simpatici e cortesi. Almeno un saluto all'ingresso e all'uscita potrebbero farlo; anche se a richiesta molto disponibili; gentili anche nell'accontentarci alla richiesta di una camera con vista sulla rambla. Comunque vacanza da ricordare nella splendida Barcellona anche grazie a questo splendido hotel!!!! Grazie ORIENTE!!!! ",5,2015,09,01
60,Giuseppe da Caltanissetta,"Ottima posizione, personale accogliente e disponibile, camera e bagno abbastanza puliti, manca frigobar e gli arredi da appoggio per bagagli sono veramente pochi, terzo e quarto letto scomodo perchè divano letto. Ottimo per famiglie. Nonostante la camera si affacciasse sulla Rambla chiudendo gli infissi risultava molto silenziosa e si poteva dormire tranquillamente",4,2015,08,26

60,Modesto,Ho visitato Barcellona qualche mese fa.  L'albergo trovato e che abbiamo prenotato si trova a centro  di Barcellona.  Il punto  è ottimo perché  puoi girare per la città  tranquillamente a piedi!  A parte questo immediatamente notevole è l' ingresso con un arredamento  antico non moderno. Il balcone della Camera vista sulla Ramblas ed è un incanto vederla ad ogni ora! Il bagno era piccolo e non vi erano tutti i sanitari!  Erano presenti saponi e il resto!  Letti puliti e camere pulite! Il personale poco cordiale!  ,3,2015,07,31

60,Grazie!,"Siamo stati benissimo, l'hotel è sulla Rambla e la sua posizione è perfetta. Il personale è davvero cordiale, nonostante il nostro spagnolo non perfetto.

60,Sulla rambla...occhio al prezzo!,"Ottima posizione (direttamente sulla Rambla), stanze pulite ma a seconda della posizione non molto silenziose. Classica colazione continentale per turisti.

Wi-fi perfettamente funzionante",3,2015,07,11
60,HOTEL NORMAL CON BUENA UBICACION,"es un antiguo hotel que fue remodelado, algunas habitaciones son amplias pero se les nota el paso del tiempo, tan es así que algunos muebles tienen sello de antigüedad. El desayuno se puede considerar solo normal con alimentos de  calidad regular. Lo mejor de este hotel es su ubicación en las ramblas y a metros de la plaza real, y los servicios bastante deficientes, en mi estadia de tres dias uno de ellos no se hizo limpieza de la habitacion",3,2015,07,08

60,Per quel che costa....,".... è un buon affare. Posizione centrale, pulito con personale gentile e molto disponibile. Struttura vecchiotta ma ciò si riflette sui costi più contenuti rispetto ad alberghi più chic.

Pedi habitacion tranquila y me dieron una en la parte de atras muy buena. La limpieza y el persona muy atento. Tal vez un pPlaza catalumya por oco desorbitao el precio que piden por el desayuno buffet $13,50 euros cuando desayuno en plaza catalunya dos rolls de jamos y queso un cafe con leche  exquisito y una botella de agua en un lugar muy majo por 9 euros. Por eso no desayune en el hotel, pero voveria sin duda. <me retuvieron el equipaje sin problemas hasta el momento del vuelo y la relacion calidad precio comparado con los otros en Barcelona me paecio muy buena.
volveria sin dudarlo",4,2015,06,17

El edificio es antiguo pero remodelado y acondicionado con actualidad.El personal muy amable y servicial. La habitación es cómoda y lo único que puedo criticar es el baño; su diseño es muy moderno, pero muy antifuncional, la regadera tiene dos fijos de cristal sin puerta; esto no evita que se salga agua y se moje el piso del baño. En el area de la ducha no hay donde colocar jabón shampoo etc y el lavabo es muy moderno pero no hay donde colocar ningún cosmético o accesorio. Hay escalones para llegar a la habitación. Pero aparte de eso todo muy bien.",4,2015,06,08

Sufficientemente spaziosa era al 4 e ultimo piano, silenziosa e con vista interna al cortile dell'hotel. Giudizio generale: buono; consigliato!

60,Un Hotel normal un poco ruidoso.,"Cuando llegue al hotel pedi una habitacion tranquila, y me asignaron una habitacion
que daba a la calle del costado frente a un albergue juvenil con lo que casi no puede dormir
toda la noche. Al dia siguiente plantee mi problema en recepcion e inmediatemente me cambiaron a una habitacion que daba el patio interno y ahi no tuve mas problemas de sueño.
Si tienes el sueño liviano, debes pedir una habitacion al patio interno, el resto de las habitaciones
que dan a la La Rambla o a las calles del costado son ruidosas.
Las habitaciones son chicas, pero muy limpias. No tiene mini-bar en la habitacion y si lo queres tenes que pagar 25 euros mas, lo que no recuerdo
si era por dia por la estancia.
El desayuno muy sencillo.
La ubicacion, es excelente, frente al barrio gotico, cerca de la plaza cataluña, el paseo de la gracia,
y la costa de Barcelona, donde esta el monumento a colon, acuario.
Tiene el subte a 1 cuadra y con el te moves a cualquier parte de Barcelona.
La atencion del personal MUY BUENA !!
El costo por noche es muy caro para lo que es la habitacion.",3,2015,04,14
60,"POSIZIONE OTTIMA, Personale Cortese, e buona pulizia","Siamo stati una settimana a Barcellona ed abbiamo alloggiato in questo hotel. Il punto di forza principale è sicuramente la posizione: proprio sulla Rambla, a pochi metri dal teatro Liceu e dall'omonima fermata della metro; la posizione permette di visitare a piedi molte delle attrazioni principali di Barcellona, e di raggiungere comodamente in metro o bus quelle più lontane.
Gentile e cortese il personale: purtroppo appena arrivati, mentre facevamo il check-in alla reception, siamo stati vittima del furto del passaporto, ed il personale dell'hotel si è subito messo a disposizione indicandoci dove andare alla polizia, e ci ha offerto anche 2 piccole bottigline d'acqua dato che eravamo piuttosto scossi.. è stato un gesto gentile!
Ottimo il wi-fi gratuito, che ha sempre preso bene anche in camera!
La camera è spaziosa, essenziale ma con tutto il necessario per il soggiorno: dispone di tv (no canali italiani), scrivania, ampio armadio, cassaforte di sicurezza gratuita. Le stanze standard non hanno il minifrigo-bar in camera, che però è presente nelle camere deluxe. La camera ci è stata pulita tutti i giorni, con cambio di asciugamani quotidiano, cambio di lenzuola quasi ogni giorno, insomma voto positivo anche per la pulizia! Manca il bidet nel bagno. La stanza affacciava su un cortile interno, ed è molto silenziosa. Peccato siano capitati 2 letti singoli uniti,e non un unico letto matrimoniale come avevo richiesto nella mail prima di partire. Uniche note negative: i materassi dei letti rumorosi e un scomodi, la doccia con solo un piccolo vetro che non la chiude e purtroppo fa bagnare molto a terra il bagno, e non sono riuscita a capire come spegnere l'aria condizionata calda o comunque metterla un po' più fresca, costringendoci a stare con la finestra aperta anche la sera.
Comunque buono il rapporto qualità/prezzo, e nel complesso lo consiglio, se dovessi tornare a Barcellona tornerei in questo hotel.",4,2015,04,09
60,"Ottima posizione, peccato per la camera","Sono stato qui a Pasqua con la famiglia.
POSIZIONE ottima: proprio al centro della rambla, vicinissimo alla fermata metro Liceu.
CAMERA: Abbastanza ampia, arredo spartano ma pulita con tutto quello di cui si ha bisogno per un breve soggiorno.
Purtroppo la mia recensione non è positiva: Ci ha deluso molto l'assegnazione di una camera con balcone bloccato per lavori di ristrutturazione: a tratti si soffocava.
Un consiglio: se le camere non sono abitabili evitate di darle ai turisti pur di fare soldi.",3,2015,04,08
60,Buon hotel,"Sono stato qui a Pasqua con la famiglia. La posizione è ottima, proprio al centro della rambla.

60,"Gute Lage, aber leider etwas heruntergekommen mit überfordertem Personal","Leider hat das Hotel seine besten Jahre hinter sich. Es wurde zwar notdürftig (und billig!) renoviert, seinen Charme aber komplett verloren. Es hat die Ausstrahlung von einem besseren Youth Hostel. Zimmer ok, Betten katastrophal! Frühstücksbuffet fantasielos (etwas besser als in einer Jugendherberge...). Das Personal ist leider hoffnungslos überfordert und wenig kunden- und serviceorientiert (Regeln scheinen hier höher bewertet zu werden). Wir sind um ca. 11.00 Uhr im Hotel angekommen und hätten uns gerne etwas frisch gemacht (waren seit 5.30 Uhr auf den Beinen!). Leider war das Personal sehr unflexibel, haben alle ankommenden Gäste in Zeitlupentempo abgewickelt und einzig angeboten, dass Gepäck einzustellen - Zimmer konnten erst ab 14 Uhr bezogen werden, unabhängig ob es schon bezugsbereite Zimmer gab....). Uns wurde dann ein Zimmer zugewiesen, welches das Fenster auf die Ramblas hatte (obwohl auf ihrer Hompage geschrieben steht, man könne zwischen ruhigen Zimmern in den Innenhof oder Zimmern auf die Ramblas wählen..). Als wir dann im Zimmer feststellten, dass das Fenster sich  nicht richtig schliessen liess und so eine ruhige Nachtruhe wohl kaum möglich war, reklamierten wir und wollten das Zimmer wechseln. Wir wurden schroff darauf hingewiesen, dass jemand vorbeikommen würde, um es zu reparieren. Wir wollten uns aber nicht auf dieses Experiment einlassen (zudem bevorzugten wir ein Zimmer in den Innenhof), und fragten, ob wir den nicht in ein anderes Zimmer wechseln könnten. Sie schüttelte den Kopf (beantwortete aber auch nicht meine Frage, ob sie ausgebucht seien) und meinte, wir könnten am nächsten Tag wechseln. Als wir dankend ablehnten und sagten, dass wir uns in diesem Fall sofort ein anderes Hotel suchen würden, ging es plötzlich und ein Umzug in ein Zimmer zum Innenhof war plötzlich sofort möglich....... (soviel zum Thema ""Kundenfreundlichkeit"").
Also, wer höchste Priorität auf zentrale Lage und billig legt, sollte dort übernachten, alle anderen suchen sich bitte ein anderes Hotel......",3,2015,03,30

60,buena ubicacion buena opcion,"Hotel bien ubicado en plena rambla lo que facilita su acceso en todos los horarios, con una estacion de subte casi enfrente lo que conecta toda la ciudad en poco tiempo. La habitacion era grande, no tenia frigobar. Tenia pocos enchufes lo que dificultaba cargar celulares y demas equipos electronicos. la luz no tenia perillas independientes, si sacabas la tarjeta de la luz de la habitacion te cortaba todo y si la dejaban enganchada una luz no se apagaba nunca. Los recepcionistas muy amables un poco lentos a veces. Lo malo es que aparte de ser hotel es salon de fiestas por lo tanto 2 noches frente a mi habitacion habia fiesta y un barullo impresionante que dificultaba mucho dormir. El desayuno un poco pobre no habia mucho surtido. Por temas de refaccion de fachadas no podiamos abrir la ventana de la habitacion, a la mañana a veces habia poco de ruido poque la misma daba a la calle pero bien. Mas haya de eso muy recomendable",3,2015,03,25

60,Katastroph,"Liebe Leute, Normalerweise bin ich nicht jemand der ab jeder Kleinigkeit herum heult, aber dieses Hotel war wirklich übel. Sie bauen das Hotel zurzeit um was bedeutet, dass wir ein Baugerüst vor dem Fenster hatten. Die Fenster konnte man somit nicht öffnen; den Balkon nicht benutzen und die Toilette hatte auch keine Lüftung. 
Zudem folgende Probleme:
- Betten sehr unbequem
- WC-Tür konnte man nicht abschliessen
- Geputzt wurde mehr schlecht als recht
- Licht flackerte
- Personal war unfreundlich
- Steckdosen waren alle ausser eine kaputt. 

Vielleicht hatten wir mit dem Zimmer einfach auch grosses Pech aber dieses Risiko würde ich nicht mehr eingehen.",1,2015,02,15

Inoltre anche venendo in treno dall'areoporto si prende una sola linea metro (L3 verde) senza ulteriori cambi.
L'hotel è pulito e le stanze confortevoli. Non è prevista la colazione se non come extra. Vicino cmq è pieno di bar dove poterla fare. Attenzione che quando vi è troppa gente potrebbero darvi stanza interna senza finestra che poi vi cambieranno prontamente. Difatti poi affacciavo direttamente sulle ramblas, bellissimo anche se rumoroso fino ad una certa ora (niente che non vi faccia cmq dormire).
Accanto c'è anche una stazione della polizia urbana quindi siete al sicuro :)
Vicinissomo avete anche tutta la zona commerciale della città per dedicarvi allo shopping e scendendo verso il mare siete vicino alla Barcelloneta e quindi a zona ristorantini di mare.

Esta claro que cuando uno elige un 3 estrellas uno tiene claro a lo que se arriesga, pero al final parece que esta eleccion ha sido un deporte de riesgo. Plato de ducha con grifo de bañera, cortina de tela, las dos cosas combinadas hacían del momento de la ducha un verdadero desastre, cortina que se pega, grifo que se quedaba en medio con el riesgo de darte un golpe con el, en fin un desastre. Si hablamos de la fachada, ya es un poema, la fachada lateral toda asegurada con telas para que no caigan cascotes, grietas en el dintel de nuestro balcón, un andamio en la puerta del hotel (nadie nos había dicho nada),... Eso si, estaba muy limpio, las cosas como son. Creo que un hotel en estas condiciones no tendría que estar abierto mas que nada por el peligro que deja entrever.

La posizione è strategica, vicinissimo alla fermata Liceu della metro, a metà sulla Rambla, è stato facile raggiungere tutti i punti principali da visitare a piedi; l'unico difetto, la mancanza dell'insonorizzazione delle camere e i pasti che non sono inclusi, nemmeno la colazione. Per avere la colazione inclusa, occorreva aggiungere 13 euro al giorno al prezzo della camera, cosa un po' assurda perché a due passi dall'hotel c'è la boqueria, e li per la colazione si spende molto meno.",3,2014,07,31

La habitación limpia, muy corrrecta con un pequeñito balcón que dá al paseo de las Ramblas, evidentemente, un fin de semana entre la gente de Barcelona y los turistones que venimos y nos juntamos todos en ellas (Las Ramblas), pues dentro de la habitación se oye el ""Run-run"" de la calle, pero a mi modo de ver, esto no puede ser una cruz para este hotel. Ademas el personal muy atento y ofrecen muy buenas recomendaciones para comer o cenar.",4,2014,07,28
60,Ottimo,"Tutto pulito, colazione abbondante e molto varia, personale molto professionale e gentile parlano anche in italiano. In pieno centro sulle Ramblas ottima posizione per raggiungere la metro e vicino al mare.",5,2014,07,14
60,maravilloso,"primer viaje a barcelona,muy centrico hotel,personal de recepcion muy eficiente y profesional,buffet muy correcto y jefe de personal muy atento .sevillanos profesionales enla terraza cocteles de diez ,mojito y sangria realmente lo mejor ,repetiremos",5,2014,06,09
60,Kurzurlaub,"Sehr gute Lage direkt an der la rambla, Fenster im Bad. 
Sehr freundliches Personal. Zimmer waren supersauber, auch wenn sie nicht mehr die neuesten sind. Es ist jedem weiter zu empfehlen der in idealer Lage seinen Urlaub verbringen mag.
Die nächste U- Bahn ist 2 Minuten entfernt.",4,2014,06,08
60,Excelente opción en Barcelona,"Es un hotel muy bien ubicado, en plena Rambla, cerca del barrio Gótico y a una cuadra del Metro. Pero lo mejor que tiene es el trato amable y comprometido del personal de recepción. Todos ellos se desviven por atender bien a los pasajeros. Eso nos hace sentir como en casa.",5,2014,06,03
60,La posizione è il punto di forza,"L'hotel era in ristrutturazione quando l'abbiamo visitato (marzo 2014): è ricavato da un antico convento ed è al centro delle ramblas (fermata MM Liceu a 100 mt)
Le uniche note stonate sono state l'appena sufficiente insonorizzazione delle camere che danno sulla Ramblas, che potrebbe costituire un problema per chi non riesce a prendere sonno facilmente e la pulizia delle camere, un po' sotto gli standard italiani
Per il resto, se mirate alla posizione e facilità di spostamenti, è una scelta davvero azzeccata: al centro della movida barceloneta e dei posti da visitare.",3,2014,06,02
60,Posizione ottima,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel per 3 notti nel ponte del 25 aprile con il mio compagno. La posizione è davvero eccellente, la pecca è che se vi capita una camera che si affaccia sulla rambla, sarà molto difficile dormire; noi fortunatamente, dopo la prima notte in bianco, abbiamo chiesto di poterci spostare in un camera interna e la qualità del sonno è deciasamente migliorata!!!
Le camere sono molto semplici ma pulite. La colazione lascia decisamente a desiderare, per cui, a meno che non sia compresa nel prezzo, consiglio di farla in uno dei tanti bar presenti nella zona!
Lo consiglierei per la posizione (metro a 2 minuti a piedi) che ci ha fatto risparmiare veramente molto tempo!",4,2014,05,27
60,In centro sulle ramblas,"A parte il disagio di dover aspettare fino alle 14 per poter avere la camera, per il resto l'hotel, pur centralissimo sulle Ramblas, è silenzioso, molto tranquillo, pulito, con camere ampie.
Consigliato assolutamente",4,2014,05,21
60,Perfetto per un week-end,"Hotel sulla Rambla, comodo perché a due passi hai la metropolitana. Le camere sono in stile classico e pulite. Questo Hotel ha un buon per il prezzo in qualsiasi stagione. Lo consiglio sia per vacanze tra amici sia di coppia.",3,2014,05,16
60,Senza infamia e senza lode!!,"La posizione è molto buona,sulla Rambla e vicinissimo alla stazione metro ""Liceau"", anche i ragazzi della reception sono molto gentili e carini ma l'hotel in se per se non è niente di che, semplicissimo e senza la minima utilità, non ti forniscono neanche il minibar, spetta solo alle camere superior e nel bagno non c'è una mensoletta per poggiare le cose neanche a pagarla oro....comunque se non avete grandi pretese può andar bene!",3,2014,04,12
60,Perfetto per un week-end,"Hotel ok, personale davvero gentile; posizione perfetta;prezzo onesto.
Qualche pecca per il WIFI usato solo pochi minuti in tre giorni , non si connetteva,per il resto tutto bene camere pulite, il letto un pò duretto...",4,2014,03,10
60,RELAX,"Consigliato qualche pecca per il WIFI usato solo pochi minuti in tre giorni , non si connetteva,per il resto tutto bene camere pulite, grazie hai consigli di PEDRO abbiamo visto le cose piu' belle cosigliate da lui e mangiato bene sempre grazie a lui !!!! Se dovessi tornare soggiornerei ancora qua!! comunque grazie a tutto il personale gentile e sorridente.",4,2014,03,07
60,Ubicación y atención,"Es un hotel algo anticuado pero tiene su encanto ya que ahí se han filmado películas. La ubicación es inmejorable en la Rambla, a pocos metros del Liceo y de la Boqueria, por ejemplo. La atención del personal es excelente. Creo que es una muy buena opción en Barcelona. Volvería sin dudas.",3,2014,03,02
60,Soggiorno nel'hotel,"Abbiamo soggiornato presso questo hotel,nel week-end,dal 22/02/2014 al 24/02/2014,l'hotel si presenta pulito e in buono stato,personale molto cordiale e accogliente.
Tutto sommato ci siamo trovati bene,la camera non dava sulla Rambla,ma per fortuna visto il movimento che c'è di sera su questa via principale.
Due cose da segnalare negativamente,la prima il servizio wifi molto decadente,due giorni senza mai utilizzarlo perché non ci si riusciva a collegarsi,la seconda le pareti delle stanze molto leggere,il minimo rumore della stanza di fianco si sente.
",3,2014,02,25
60,Se tornassi a Barcellona soggiornerei ancora lì,"Ho pernottato in una stanza tripla senza usufruire del vitto: infatti mentre non eravamo interessate al pranzo e alla cena perché desideravamo consumarli fuori, la colazione l'avremmo consumata volentieri in hotel, ma abbiamo rinunciato per via del prezzo troppo alto: 13€ a persona al giorno....su qualsiasi bar lungo la Rambla, che pure non sono certo bar a buon mercato, abbiamo fatto colazione spendendo meno della metà. Per quanto riguarda l'alloggio, abbiamo apprezzato la stanza calda, ampia e luminosa, oltre che l'estrema pulizia dell'ambiente, il tutto ad un prezzo più che onesto. Inoltre, la posizione centralissima è il vero plus di questo hotel. Unica nota  dolente è la connessione wi-fi che è si gratuita, ma funziona un po' a singhiozzi. Il personale alla reception è stato gentilissimo.",4,2014,02,25
60,Consigliato,"Consigliato se non si hanno troppe pretese. L'albergo è un tre stelle, centralissimo, molto pulito, con camere piuttosto spaziose ma molto semplici. Il personale poi è di una gentilezza assoluta sempre sorridente e disponibile. Certo qualche carenza magari c'è. Manca il frigobar, la colazione non è niente di che, però bisogna sempre ricordare che le stelle sono tre e che il rapporto qualità prezzo è ottimo. Poi dipende sempre da quanto uno vuole e può spendere. Se dovessi tornare a Barcellona vorrei alloggiare nuovamente qui. Sono stato benissimo. Un grazie a tutti i ragazzi del personale! Franco & Stefania. ",4,2014,02,18
60,Piacevole soggiorno,"Personale educato e disponibile!
Da segnalare Laura & Pedro per la disponibilità e cortesia
Camera pulite non grandissime.
Lo consiglio. 
La colazione,continentale,forse un po' cara, 13€ a persona al giorno..... Vicino all'albergo ci sono molti bar con prezzi modici",5,2014,02,10
60,Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo!!,"Ottima soluzione se volete:
- spendere poco;
- un alloggio pulito e confortevole;
- alloggiare in una zona centrale a due passi dai principali monumenti, dal mare e dallo splendido barrio gotico;
- in una zona ricca di negozi e ristoranti per ogni tasca;
- con due fermate della metropolitana veramente vicine (liceu e catalunya);
Questo è l'hotel che fa per voi!
Ci tornerei sicuramente!
Le camere sono arredate in modo semplice, ma spaziose e pulite.
",4,2014,02,04
60,Un hotel perfetto!,"Più di tre mesi fa siamo partiti alla ricerca di un hotel per la nostra prima vacanza all'estero.
Scorrendo tra le pagine di internet scopriamo l'hotel ""Oriente"".
Controlliamo il sito, guardiamo le foto e prenotiamo!
Abbiamo soggiornato una settimana, e che dire! L'albergo è in una posizione strategica, le camere sono molto graziose e pulite. Il personale molto gentile e disponibile, e cosa da non sottovalutare, sempre sorridente. Sono sempre stati tutti molto disponibili fino all'ultimo giorno, in particolare Pedro che ci ha sempre indirizzato degli ottimi ristoranti dove andare a cenare!!
Non esitate a prenotare se dovete fare una vacanza a Barcellona!!",5,2014,01,26
60,excelente opcion,"este hotel excelentemente ubicado, , sobre la rambla, frente a plaza rial y barrio gotico, junto al liceu y palacio guel, a 5 minutos de pza catalunya, y a 5 de port vell tiene una muy amable atencion por parte de su personal, todos jovenes y muy atentos. la limpieza es muy buena y es altamente recomendable para una visita en solitario o en familia.
tienen atenciones como ser un regalo sorpresa que le han dejado a mi hija en el dia de su cumpleaños",4,2014,01,24
60,Mejor imposible,"Estuvimos mi pareja y yo en septiembre de 2012 en Barcelona, llegamos a la ciudad despues de 12 horas de viaje a un hotel que teniamos reservado el cual nos estafo 70€ y a las 11 de la noche nos pusimos a buscar un nuevo hotel. Pasamos por la puerta de este maravilloso lugar y entramos preguntando por la habitacion, le contamos la situacion y nos hicieron un precio especial porque me vieron realmente afectada por la situacion, nos acompañaron a una habitacion preciosa, espaciosa y muy limpia, tenia vistas a Las Ramblas y no sentimos ni un minimo ruido en toda la noche, cosa de agradecer despues del largo recorrido que hicimos ese dia. A la mañana siguiente baje a recepcion para preguntar si podriamos quedarnos otra noche mas y nos dijeron que estaba el hotel completo por causa de un congreso que habia en la ciudad, pero la chica se ofrecio a buscarnos alojamiento en otro hotel, realizo unas llamadas y nos lo encontro, fue a otro hotel de la misma cadena hotelera pero situado en la calle casper, el trato alli fue igual de bueno, pero para mi el trato recibido, la atencion del personal y el hotel en general es perfecto. Si algun dia vuelvo a esta maravillosa ciudad de seguro volvere a este hotel.",5,2014,01,19
60,Soddisfatta,"Personalmente ho trovato questo hotel abbastanza elegante in rapporto a qualita'-prezzo. Le camere sono spaziose e pulite. Il personale e' gentile e disponibile, danno consigli sui luoghi da visitare in citta'. Inoltre si trova proprio sulla Ramblas, la via principale, a meta' strada tra la spiaggia e la via dello shopping. Lo consiglierei a tutti: coppie, famiglie e gruppi di amici.",5,2014,01,16
60,"Super Hotel, super Lage und freundliches Personal","Sehr schönes, sauberes Hotel mitten der La Rambla!! Wir blieben zwar nur eine Nacht, haben aber eine sehr gute Erfahrung gemacht und ich würde gleich wieder in dieses Hotel gehen. Mitten im Zentrum, Metro ist ebenfalls sehr nahe gelegen und wenn man mit dem Aerobus vom Flughafen anreist läuft man ca. 10 - 15 Minuten von Plaza Catalunya die La Rambla runter und schon ist man beim Hotel. 
Da wir so viele Leute waren, haben wir am Morgen gleich im Hotel gefrühstückt. Für 9 Euro hat man hier wirklich gut gegessen. 

Ein winziger Nachteil am Hotel ist, das es sehr hellhörig ist. Was jedoch bei jedem älteren Hotel zu erwarten ist. 

100% weiterempfehlung!",5,2014,01,15
