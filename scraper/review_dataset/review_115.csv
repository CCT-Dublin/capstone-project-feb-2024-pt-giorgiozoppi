115,Wonderful hotel and staff,"The hotel and service were again excellent. We were made to feel welcome from the very beginning, when the service at the reception was friendly and warm. Our anniversary was noticed in the most delightful way. The room was comfortable and cozy with all the necessary facilities and a good cleaning service. Breakfast was very good and vegans are catered for. Estelita and the whole team made sure that we had a happy and sunny start to the day. The location is great, just a few steps from Tottenham Court Road station. The hotel restaurants are very good, full of people and sound. We will definitely return to this hotel next time we are in London.",5,2024,10,18
115,Doyle Collection never disappoint you,"I stayed here few months ago and it was lovely. But this time was special due to my birthday celebration, and a weekend out in London, which all The Bloomsbury team made it perfect.

We were welcomed and greeted by Alejandra at Reception who was very informative and chatty with us. Once we checked-in in the room I found a prosecco bottle and lovely card wishing me a happy birthday, which was a very nice touch.

We opted to go for a drink to the glamorous  Coral Room, the Spanish guy from Valencia welcome us, and Jonathan made the Danny Ocean's cocktail for us.... And it was amazing! 
All staff was very attentive and cheerful, but they went an extra mile when Alejandro, brought us a happy birthday plate with macarons and two glasses of Champagne! Wow! Our first day couldn't start better! 

Room was lovely, very well equipped, very comfortable king size bed and nice to have shower and bath in the room. Housekeeping team refresh the room and brought some tasty chocolates in the afternoon, the room attendant who I didn't catch her name, was friendly and very smile!
                    
We were checked out by Alejandra again and she kindly kept our luggage. The very polite concierge Kem escort us to the the exit and wished us a nice journey back home. 

Thanks again to all The Bloomsbury team for such an amazing stay, we will definitely come back. 

Special attention to Marta who did the reservation for us and made sure all our stay went perfect!",5,2022,08,30
115,Outstanding,"We have been to London many times but our stay at The Bloomsbury made this trip the best ever. Our breakfast was wonderful every day and the staff , Istelita, Tania, Asha and Patrica were always happy to see us and made us feel as if we had known them as friends. The front door staff including Ivan and Peter always made sure that we felt at home and that any need was possible. I normally do not write reviews but this is an exception.",5,2024,10,17
115,The Bloomsbury Hotel exceeded our expectations!,"The  Bloomsbury Hotel exceeded our expectations! We were treated like royalty from the time we arrived. The hotel is beautifully decorated with designer wallpaper, furnishings and artwork. The Coral Room is dramatically painted in all coral with a gorgeous large elegant bar being its focal point. The staff are warm and accommodating. The rooms are beautiful with everything you need. The beds are sooo comfortable and we really appreciated having chromecast to watch our streaming services at the end of the day. The bathroom was perfect with a nice bathtub, robe and slippers, and heated floors. Breakfast was wonderful each day. The staff always greeted us by name. I loved the avacdo toast with the copper Moran poached eggs. The staff is what makes this hotel. The GM even came to say hello to us at breakfast. The location is perfect. Two blocks from the British Museum and all transportation. Quiet neighborhood with 2 great pubs nearby. We LOVED this hotel and will only stay here when we come back to London.",5,2024,10,17
115,Provided a take away breakfast,"We were just passing through London and were leaving early the next morning.  When the front desk was made aware of our plans they immediately made arrangements for a more than generous take away breakfast.  
Great location, great service, clean and comfortable choice.  Go.",5,2024,10,13
115,Nice room - and (generally) great staff,"We visited for just one night when going to the theatre. We were pleased to be upgraded to a Studio Suite, which was a nice and spacious room - although oddly quite difficult for room service breakfast as it had no table or suitable chairs to eat from. Nevertheless the room service breakfast was good, given the limitations of the format. We had a complimentary cocktail in the Coral Room before we left for the theatre and this was good and service was immaculate. Unfortunately when we came back after the theatre it was not so good - we wanted coffee but, even though the Coral Room was open much later, apparently the coffee machine ‘had been switched off’ and  we could only be offered tea!. The waitress was a bit rough and ready in her manner and we didn’t feel very welcome.",4,2024,10,13
115,Anniversary Celebration,"Thank you for the fantastic stay with the lovely treats in our room. We really appreciated.
Warm welcome from all the staff and exceptional service received from Mihai, Yijao, Ivan, Antonio and Marta.
We're looking forward to come back soon.",5,2024,10,13
115,The service is beyond what I even thought was possible!,"Four star hotel with a 6 star experience.  The service is what makes this hotel a gem.  Everyone from the moment that I exited the car to when I entered another to leave was so very friendly, helpful, kind and even fun!  Dale, the concierge answered all of my questions and made some wonderful recommendations.  The beautiful young woman at the registration desk (shame on me for forgetting her name), was sweet, helpful and a joy to see on almost a daily basis.  Peter from the moment that I stepped foot onto Bloomsbury grounds to the night before I left was kind, informative, and exceeded that which I expected with regards to directions, information etc.  Tony was a joy with who to speak, lots of knowledge information and fun.  And there was an older man with glasses who was very kind as well as a younger man who made my day whenever I saw him with his big smile and greeting of ""good morning.""  This staff is not one of a 4 star hotel, but that of a 10 stars if such thing existed.  Exceptional!  The hotel itself was very nice and clean. .. not fancy like the Ritz, so if that is what you want, then don't book, but it is quaint, lovely, well decorated and clean.  The rooms are a nice size.  I love that they had a kettle and Nespresso machine, so I was able to have tea and night to warm me up a bit from the damp cold as well as coffee in the morning.  Nice selection of teas and always leaving cookies!  The housekeeping staff kept my room clean.  The bed was so comfortable with nice, white crisp clean sheets.  The only issues I had were 1: the heating/cooling system can be confusing until you learn how to use it 2. until the day that I left, I could not figure out the lighting system-- so many switches and I don
t know which worked what, except for the restroom and the little ones beside the bed 3. the outlet in the bathroom had only 2 prongs instead of 3, whereby I had to used the hairdryer in the room.  It was very quiet for the most part: I hardly heard any police sirens and only heard one neighbor talking, but she had a naturally loud voice as I learned on the elevator!   I ate breakfast only one morning, and realized that it wasn't worth the money for me as I am a tiny eater in the morning.  But they did have a nice selection and the food was very good, but I preferred to go the creperie around the corner every evening to pick up a croissant, which is plenty for me in the morning.  The bar area is upscale, beautiful and very popular... every night it was quite full, but there are seats.  Evidently, locals enjoy it as well as patrons.  But the noise did not transfer into the rooms. The location is excellent: tube is essentially one block away, theater district 15 minutes walk, Westminster Abbey, Parliament etc., 20 minutes (I am a faster walker, so 25 for some), Piccadilly 15 minutes, British museum 3-5 minute walk.  Essentially there is much to see within a short walking distance and the tube is right there.  Overall, I cannot say enough about the Bloomsbury!  I recommend this hotel to anyone who appreciates extraordinary service, comfort, cleanliness and a optimal location.  And thank you to all of those who work there who made my trip so delightful!",5,2024,10,10
115,Great hotel for a break in central London,"Great ambience, wonderful room, kind and helpful staff, fantastic location for seeing central London.  The Bloomsbury Hotel is an oasis right in the centre of London.  From start to finish - first rate.  Great breakfast to start the day, superb Cocktails to wind down in the evening.",5,2024,10,09
115,Sweet small hotel,"Super pleasant small hotel with pleasant public places (restaurant, bar, sitting room) and a very helpful and relaxed staff. They took interest in the fact that I was travelling with my violin and we had some enjoyable personal banter regarding this. They were happy to keep our luggage for us when checkout time was well in advance of our flights. Finding the hotel was a bit tricky-- address is on Great Russell Street but entrance is down a little alley off of Great Russell Street.",5,2024,10,09
115,Lovely old hotel,"Lovely hotel tucked away in a quiet street. The room was quite nice and we had everything we needed. The breakfast buffet every morning was fabulous - fresh fruit, croissants, meat, cheese, cereals, juice, toast. And then a whole hot food menu as well. Estelita, Maria, Mohammad, and Patricia took good care of us! Also a very cool bar and old library in the hotel too. I would stay here again if I ever made it back to London.",5,2024,10,09
115,Top-Notch Stay,"The staff and facilities were excellent, and our overall stay was wonderful. While the lobby/check-in is small, they have a lovely sitting room next to it that welcomes you. It also provides daytime refreshments like iced tea or lemonade for its guests. Our room was well-appointed and well-kept. The bathroom, while small, was well organized. Products in the room were top-notch, and their daily breakfast service was super generous and delicious. The concierge desk is terrific, and they made great recommendations for diners and other activities.",5,2024,10,09
115,"We stayed two times here in September, both times great!","The Bloomsbury provides excellent friendly service.  The hotel is down a side street so its fairly quiet for the city.  The staff was helpful and always smiling.  The room was comfortable, the only thing to consider is that they are doing construction on the facade, so unfortunately we had scaffolding and  equipment that obscured the view. Other than that we really enjoyed our stay.",5,2024,10,07
115,Good to explore London  as a base,"Good location for tourists and business 
Easy walk to excellent restaurants and tubes so ideal to explore 
Would recommend requesting a room above first floor level as it can be noisy from traffic,
Excellent breakfast and room service,
Comfortable but above  mid range price !",4,2024,10,04
115,Perfect in every way,We have stayed at the Bloomsbury before and it is always wonderful.  Staff could not be nicer.  I had an issue with my suitcase which 2 members of staff helped me to fix.  We ate breakfast there every day and it was consistently delicious.  Very quiet with comfy beds.  Had no complaints about anything and we were there for 4 nights!,5,2024,10,02
115,Great food and excellent service.,"Every hotel needs learning, I always say: where things are; how they work; what’s best to do when they don’t. Awkward encounters with the plumbing and heating, and advertised facilities that turn out to be unavailable don’t matter anywhere near as much when the staff are as lovely and friendly and helpful as they are at the Bloomsbury.

The food is wonderful too, and if the Bloody Mary I had was a fair example, so are the cocktails.",4,2024,10,01
115,Perfect,"I had the most marvelous experience at the Bloomsbury. The hotel is both charming and gorgeous and the staff were impeccable, knowledgeable, attentive, kind and fun. My time there was a highlight of my stay in London. Don’t miss dining on the Dalloway Terrace and enjoying a drink at the Coral Bar. The food is fabulous and the terrace and bar are both stunning. This elegant enclave and priceless staff made my trip❣️ All golden✨✨✨I highly recommend.
Deborah Donohue Wills",5,2024,09,28
115,Best staff at any London hotel,"This is my second stay at The Bloomsbury and it was just as delightful as the first. The best thing is the staff - from Antonio the porter to Peter to the staff in the Trellis room who always seemed to remember my name - everyone is so nice and helpful.

Second, the hotel is gorgeous with lots of sitting rooms to relax it feels like you’re in an English countryside home.

Lastly lots of food and drink options. The Coral Room is fantastic as is breakfast and even in room dining.

I’ll bet back next month!",5,2024,09,26
115,Lovely stay at the Bloomsbury,"The Bloomsbury is a 5 star hotel for me – my Cosy Room was very comfortable for a weeklong stay, with a large bathroom and all the Malin + Goetz amenities I needed (and more!). Breakfast was fantastic and highly recommended. The staff (especially manager Greg who had to solve an issue at 4am in the morning) are wonderfully attentive and hospitable. In addition to regular cleaning, they also have turndown service. Great location close to Tottenham Court Road tube station, with many theatres in walking distance. Great value for what I received. I would definitely return.",5,2024,09,25
115,Beautiful and well-run hotel,"I recently organised a corporate event at this beautiful and well-run hotel.  The on-site events team are professional and efficient.  Special thanks to Cosmin who was a pleasure to deal with, nothing was too much trouble for him.  I would not hesistate to book another event here.   
I hope to return one day as a leisure guest to enjoy a drink in the stunning Coral Bar!",5,2024,09,24
115,A wonderful weekend escape,"An excellent hotel in a super handy location to visit all that London has to offer.
The staff are super nice and really helpful. The continental breakfast is plentiful and full of choice even for vegan!
The hotel is clean and the decor straight out of a magazine",5,2024,09,22
115,Superb Hotel - Exceeded All Expectations,"We had a fantastic experience at the Bloomsbury Hotel during an anniversary trip to London in September 2024. We would recommend this hotel to anyone taking a trip to London. 

The amenities and service were impeccable and the staff was, to a person, unbelievably helpful and generous. The rooms are very nice (we received a free upgrade upon check-in) and the bathrooms were extremely modern. The on-site bar and restaurant are also top notch, both in terms of decor and the quality of food and drink. We opted for breakfast to be included which was definitely the right call - the food and staff were amazing every morning.

The hotel is also centrally located to a number of great areas to eat and visit (Soho, Charlotte Street, Covent Garden, etc), which are loaded with great restaurants, shops and pubs. It is also literally a 3 minute walk to a Tube stop with service just about anywhere you want, to include Heathrow. 

Overall, this was a great choice for our stay and we would happily go back. We are so happy with our choice to stay at the Bloomsbury.",5,2024,09,22
115,Wonderful Experience at The Bloomsberry Hotel London,"Great experience staying in Bloomsbury and would like to call out Maria, Estilita,Patricia, Mohammad and Yijiao. Thanks for your hospitality and making me feel at home. The food was amazing, specially the fruits and vegetables considering I am a vegetarian.",5,2024,09,20
115,A Stunning Hotel,"This is the most beautiful hotel I have stayed in. There are so many beautiful details. The fresh flowers, the fireplace, the colours. My husband and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and the staff went above and beyond to make our experience the greatest. We can't wait to come back. Thank you so much.",5,2024,09,18
115,"Charming Hotel, Excellent Location (Inquire About Construction)","The location was excellent (steps from the Tottenham Court Rd tube station and the British Museum), the staff was enormously friendly, the rooms were comfortable and charming, and the main restaurant/bar had good food, even better drinks, and a great ambiance. My only complaint is that the property's exterior windows were undergoing renovations during our stay, and so there was loud construction right outside our room's window starting around 8 a.m. several mornings. (And I mean *right* outside the window -- if you opened the curtains, you would see a worker immediately on the other side of the glass.)",4,2024,09,16
115,Fantastic hotel,"We truly enjoyed our all-too brief stay at The Bloomsbury.  The hotel's location was perfect. Our room was comfortable, so comfortable that the bed was too nice to get out of LOL.  Had it not been London outside those windows, we might not have.  The staff were great, and I even enjoyed chatting with the Concierge who was interested in helping me find a mystery locale that I visited in London several decades prior.  The bar is fantastic, as was breakfast . . . I loved both, tremendously.  The only bad part of our stay was that we were not there long enough.  We will be back.",5,2024,09,12
115,Love The Bloomsbury London.,"I stayed in The Bloomsbury for three days last week, choosing it because of a few previous excellent experiences. I wasn’t disappointed. Warm, friendly, welcoming staff throughout the hotel….reception, Coral room and breakfast room. My room was very comfortable with fluffy pillows giving a most comfortable night’s sleep. I will be back and highly recommend Thd Bloomsbury for it’s wonderful staff and food and it’s very convenient location, just two minutes from Tottenham Court Road tube station.",5,2024,09,10
115,"Best in class, possibly best in town","The Coral Room has to be the perfect antidote to the first wet, grey day of autumn 2024. Everyone from doorman to wait staff conspires to make you feel like a welcome friend, the luscious coral decor lifts the heart, the food is both delicious and generous. 
And then there’s Emma. Emma looked after us from 10.30 till 3 with good advice, 100% attentive service and unique good humour. Return inevitable:)",5,2024,09,07
115,The Bloomsbury - Luxurious and well located,"We stayed for six nights at The Bloomsbury Hotel at the end of August. The new Elizabeth Line made it easy to travel from Heathrow Airport. The hotel is a two-minutes walk from the Tottenham Court Road station.

While the initial impression of The Bloomsbury might seem quirky, as their main entrance backs up to the brick wall of a playhouse, the experience quickly becomes personal and friendly. The doormen are attentive and ready to help with your luggage up the steps to the reception area.

We were checked in by Eva, who brought a cheerful and eager-to-please approach to her work. She took her time explaining the available amenities nearby and the ins and outs of the hotel.

We stayed in two rooms since we had made separate bookings. Both were very comfortable and quiet. The proportions of the rooms are more in line with European hotels, but had a luxurious feel and there was ample space in both to move around and unpack. My wife particularly appreciated the evening turn-down service.

The doormen are not just there to carry your luggage. Ivan and Antonio frequently checked in with us as we came and went, offering helpful advice on where to eat and what to do. The Bloomsbury is ideally located for visiting the British Museum, which is about a five-minute walk away. The area is filled with charming shops and cafes. Covent Garden is nearby. For shopping enthusiasts, Oxford Street is easily accessible from the main tube intersection.

Breakfast was a highlight. The wait staff engage with you, inquire about your stay, and discuss your plans for the day. We enjoyed talking with Tanya, who shared her stories of leaving Ukraine and her journey to joining The Bloomsbury. We also received exceptional service from Tara and Mohamed. The hotel's bar, the Coral Room, and Dalloway Terrace restaurant are elegant and have great food and drinks.

Having stayed in many hotels around the world, we would rank The Bloomsbury at the top of our list. It offers great value and a genuine sense of being part of the local hotel community, making it feel like home while exploring London.",5,2024,09,05
115,Wonderful hotel with great service and within walking/tube to most attractions,"My friend and I recently visited London from the US, and we were blown away by The Bloomsbury Hotel. When choosing a hotel, I very strategically looked for a hotel that was central to all that we wanted to see and had easy access to the tube or within walking distance. This hotel is that gem, close to everything! From check-in to check-out, the service from all of the staff was wonderful and accommodating. We enjoyed drinks in the Coral Room (you have to get the truffle fries) and breakfast as well (really everything you need to get your London day going). The beds are very comfortable and the decor is a vibe. I will be back in the future!",5,2024,09,04
115,"An excellent experience, custoner service at it's best.","A great experience all round, headed up by Cosmin Huseyn. The team at the Bloomsbury could not do enough to make our corporate event a resounding success. A great hotel with a 5 star attitude and service ethic to go with it.

The events team met every request with a positive, can do attitude, nothing was too much trouble.",5,2024,09,04
115,Wonderful Experience,"We would stay here again and recommend this hotel to others. This hotel had some of the kindest staff and best service that we have experienced at a hotel. We had a great dinner on our first night at the Dalloway Terrace. We also enjoyed both bars in the hotel. Room service breakfast was also prompt and delicious. It was also very easy to get here from LHR airport by taking the Elizabeth Line straight to Tottenham Court Road. The location in London may not be for everyone, but if you are looking to stay in this area I would pick this hotel again and again. Our room was on the smaller side but was comfortable and tastefully decorated. There was no view from our room, but we didn't come to London to spend a lot of time in our room. I read many reviews for London hotels before choosing this one and I'm so glad I did.",5,2024,09,04
115,Wonderful Experience in London!,"Had a wonderful stay over Labor Day weekend! The hotel is designed beautifully, the staff was friendly and attentive, the breakfast was plentiful, and the room was very comfortable. The hotel is steps away from the tube, so getting around was very easy. Also steps away from the British Museum. All in all, a very positive experience, and will be returning. They've got a lifelong customer in me!",5,2024,09,04
115,To the Bloomsberry writing group,"This was the most exceptional hotel. We chose because of the references to the Bloomsberry writing/painting group and we’re not disappointed.
   The hotel is beautiful, and we were immediately greeted with a glass of champagne.
   Everyone here has been so lovely towards us and it has been a fabulous day. We look forward to coming back.!",5,2024,09,03
115,All show and no go,"Facilities were good, food excellent, location wonderful but staff communication was extremely poor leading to inability to manage our expectations or deal effectively with problems and complaints.
On check in we were not told the windows in our deluxe corner suite would be covered by scaffolding. However a bigger concern was to see workmen crawling directly outside our windows from early morning. The only way we would have had to manage privacy during our 4 day stay would have been to keep all blinds and curtains closed! Windows were obviously redundant in that case 😁. We requested a room change. During the shift a boot was left behind but unfortunately, when it was located by housekeeping, it was sent directly to lost and found without anyone thinking to let us know. The missing boot only became obvious to us when repacking for checkout and given no previous notice from the hotel we assumed it was still somewhere within the current room. It was only after considerable time checking and double checking did it occur to us that the boot may be in the original room. When checking with reception we were told someone would check and get back to us. After sometime, without response, we decided to proceed to check out and there repeated our request for the lost item. Yes it had been found by housekeeping and had been sitting in lost and found.
We were also missing a Bluetooth speaker which we felt housekeeping may have assumed was a room feature. We therefore asked for the room to be checked. Since the room was now occupied by another guest we were led to understand the manager would investigate personally and get back to us. There was no return call and when we made further inquiries the manager was completely unaware of the situation. 
Given hotel advertising and pricing positions this at the “high end”, our experiences left us extremely disappointed with the management systems and ability of staff to genuinely meet customer service expectations.",3,2024,09,02
115,Loved our stay at The Bloomsbury!!!,"We had an excellent stay at The Bloomsbury. The room was cozy, comfortable and very quiet and the staff was so welcoming and helpful. We loved the sitting room next to the lobby, it was a comfortable and convenient place to wait for our taxis (and so beautifully decorated!). A highlight was The Coral Room, what an amazing bar! I highly recommend the Divine Temptation! We'll definitely return for our next stay in London.",5,2024,08,30
115,Antonio is the best,Antonio was the absolute best ! So extremely helpful and friendly ! He helped up so many times throughout our stay. The hotel is gorgeous .  The complimentary breakfast is exceptional and the entire staff is unbelievable. I’ll be back for sure! 12/10 !,5,2024,08,29
115,First class hotel; a little bit of luxury,"A first class hotel, and our second stay this year.
Plus points: central location, exceptionally comfortable beds and linens of top quality.  Not so good: the wafer thin toilet roll which I always manage to put my finger through; low level lighting which is not bright enough, for example, to put on make up.  
Other than that, a comfortable, central hotel with the most marvellous breakfasts and a lively bar.",4,2024,08,27
115,It was amazing,"It was a great experience.. The hotel location is excellent and the staff at the hotel were more than wonderful, including the reception staff, including Marta and Aheera and Shannon.. As well as the cleanliness of the hotel, the quietness and comfort..",5,2024,08,27
115,Always a great stay!,I have stayed her numerous times for work its it always amazing.  Great service and everything is very comfortable and clean.  They have great communal areas as well and really go above and beyond to look after you. I always look forward to returning.,5,2024,08,26
115,Good Location and Great Breakfast,"We spent one night at the Bloomsbury and enjoyed our stay. Check-in was swift and the room a good size with a super comfortable bed and had a fully stocked mini bar. The bathroom was also fully stocked with miniature Malin + Goetz hair and skin products, shaving, dental and vanity sets.

The onsite Coral Room cocktail bar is worth a visit to try one of their signature cocktails, I had the Summers Blood which was delightful.

The breakfast comprises a complimentary continental breakfast, which had a great selection including a range of options that are gluten-free. You can also purchase a selection of cooked breakfasts as well, again with gluten-free options available.

The hotel is located 5 minutes walk from Tottenham Court Road tube and Elizabeth line station and is close the British Museum.",4,2024,08,26
115,WONDERLAND in a London Hotel,"Treat yourself to the best suite you can afford.  It will be worth it!  The suite rooms are exquisite and will make your stay in London really special.  The whole hotel is a haven of luxury with a quintessentially British feel that will delight any visitor to the UK and make any Brit feel right at home.  Be sure you make time in your itinerary to enjoy the hotel's gorgeous bars, restaurants and facilities, where you can drink and dine in utterly delightful, stylish, but very relaxed settings, attended to by charming, skilled staff.  

I stay often in London and nowhere is quite as good as this for an all-round fabulous experience.  I'll definitely splurge on a junior suite every time to maximise the enjoyment.  It was wonderful to spend time in the hotel's bars and restaurants on my own, people watching and enjoying the atmosphere, which is really important to me as a solo female guest.   The central location is fantastic for access to the best that London has to offer, but it's also great not to have to go out to have a wonderful evening.  

Thank you blooming Bloomsbury.",5,2024,08,23
115,Excellent hotel and great location!,"I can’t say enough about the Bloomsbury Hotel!  Location is great,  very comfortable rooms, and the staff were all so friendly and helpful!  We loved the Dalloway Terrace Restaurant and the Coral Room Bar.  Also, the breakfast is the best!  They arranged a driver to pick us up after the Taylor Swift Concert which made getting back to the hotel so easy!  Shannon, Luhaina, Mihai, Brian, and Maria were all fabulous!  But, I am sure I am leaving some out.  We highly recommend The Bloomsbury and look forward to our next visit there!",5,2024,08,23
115,Amazing stay and beautiful hotel,Fabulous stay at this beautiful hotel. The rooms were gorgeous and the food was delicious. We stayed for my daughter’s birthday and everyone made it so lovely for her. Thankyou - and a special thankyou  to Ajeena and Yijiao as well for going that extra mile for us all!,5,2024,08,20
115,Great stay in the West End,"Beautiful hotel. Comfortable rooms. Multiple spaces around the lobby for reading or relaxing. Breakfast is incredible. The staff were excellent - Tony and Antonio were particularly welcoming and helpful throughout our stay. Location is a block away from a lot of tourist traffic but the location feels quiet. Walking distance from tons of theatres. Blocks from the British Museum and multiple subway stations. Very easy to get around from here. Pricey (but that’s unavoidable for this area) but made for a very convenient and enjoyable trip, would stay here again.",5,2024,08,20
115,Fabulous Home Base in London!,"My husband and I stayed at The Bloomsbury for three nights in August. The hotel is in a central location and close to the tube, making it easy to come and go to the airports and daily sightseeing. The staff are friendly and one is more helpful than the next! We stayed in a King Standard room. The bed was extremely comfortable and our bathroom was perfect. Sparkling and still water was provided along with other treats to enjoy. One of the highlights is the terrific breakfast served. Maria, Patricia, Mohamed, and Gdouela were attentive and welcoming each morning. Having a drink in the Coral Room was lovely as well. Ricardo was also welcoming and helpful! Belonging to several online travel groups and studying up on London,  I am thrilled we chose this hotel. They treat you to a luxurious experience at a very good value. As we were out and about in London, I looked forward to our return to The Bloomsbury each night!",5,2024,08,18
115,Wife's birthday ,Lovely hotel. Stayed in a king deluxe room  very spacious staff friendly and  helpful . We would stay here again without question. Close to the British museum and Oxford street for all your shopping. Wife had birthday while we were here we were given a cheese and wine plate .very nice would highly recommend ,5,2024,08,17
115,The Bloomsbury sets the mark for excellence in hoteliers.,"If travelers have any chance at all to pass through London then our family can't recommend, highly enough, the exceptional experience that they're sure to receive at the Bloomsbury. I've never lodged at a place where the staff is so expert at working to ensure that their guests have an excellent stay in town. From recommending fine establishments at which to dine, to having the concierge obtain a car on super-short notice, the folks at the Bloomsbury have made their way into our hearts as the place we must stay when in the area. Further, the hotel location makes it simple to reach many of the well known attractions in the area including the British Museum and Covent Garden. It's also a short walk away from Tottenham Court Road station (Metro). This means (for those arriving to London through Heathrow) it is essentially a straight shot train ride from the airport (using the Elizabeth) until you arrive in the area whewre The Bloomsbury is located. It's just around the corner from the train stop so reaching it could not be more convenient. We're certain to stay there again once we return back to London in the future. (We will miss the nightly chocolates, and turn-down service almost immediately 8-())",5,2024,08,13
115,Above and beyond.,"My stay at The Bloomsbury was excellent but it was what happened afterward that I will never forget. I had to return to The Bloomsbury because, when I arrived at the airport there was a problem with my return visa so I couldn't board the plane. A friend contacted my overseas family and the hotel staff, seeing how stressed I was, went out of their way to provide me with practical and emotional support. They upgraded my room and, over the next two days, with help from my friend and family, sent, received and printed the necessary documents from overseas to resolve the problem and I was able to fly home.",5,2024,08,07
115,Beautiful hotel in London!,"Just returned from a wonderful stay in London at the Bloomsbury Hotel. 

We arrived very early in the morning at 7am and knew the chances would be low in getting our room early. Gregory was so lovely in welcoming us, arranging coffee and had us in a room within an hour (which was an upgrade) which was so appreciated after a long international flight. He then called us later in the day to make sure everything was ok and if we needed anything. Superb service which continued throughout our stay.

The hotel itself is beautiful. Our room was spacious for London, well equipped, so clean & comfortable. Excellent location which was walking distance to everything we needed or a quick taxi for anything further out. 

The staff are all so lovely & down to earth. The doormen greeted us every day, were always smiling and nothing was ever a bother. 

Breakfast was great with an included a-la-carte menu + buffet. Everything ordered was fresh and quality. The breakfast staff were wonderful, provided excellent service & even remembered our names each day! 

We dined at Dalloway Terrace twice during our stay and had drinks at the Coral Room. Both were lovely and excellent quality. 

We will definitely stay here again when we return to London!",5,2024,08,07
115,A must stay. Great 4 star hotel,"Excellent 4 star hotel. Great location. Breakfast and bars very good. 
Staff were excellent and very polite. 100% would stay again.
Cost was reasonable for London these days.
One small problem is that there’s a bar over the road which was noisy at closing time. And being next to Dominion theatre the bin collectors  collect there rubbish early. So I heard on both mornings 6.00am bottle smashing which woke me up.",5,2024,08,06
115,Never disappoints….,Always so happy to be in the hotel. It really feels like home and never disappoints. The bed is so comfortable and always provides the best night sleep. The team is so welcoming and always friendly. The breakfast team is there for a long time and recognise you when you are back! The location near Tottenham Court with the Elizabeth line provides easy access from the airport! We will be back.,5,2024,08,05
115,A Fantastic Stay,"This is the best hotel we've ever stayed in London. The hotel itself is beautiful, lovely ambience. Our king room was exceptionally comfortable and large for London standards. We were here for a birthday celebration and the staff went way and beyond expectations. From Suhaina, to Mihai, the cheeky chappy doormen who work so hard. All of the staff remember your name! Breakfast was fantastic, as a coeliac sufferer, the hotel accommodated my diet and were very knowledgeable about coeliacs disease. We can't wait to return, a brilliant stay.",5,2024,08,02
115,Beautiful Bloomsbury,"We needed to make a long overdue visit to London for a City fix … we reviewed the usual sites and our eyes were taken by The Bloomsbury, most notably for its facilities and wonderful reviews, particularly those of the staff. 

Check-in was seamless and the room that we received beautifully decorated and spacious … plenty of room for us to store our belongings and stretch our legs. Given a hot weekend in London the air-con provided us some light relief from the heat outside and a good night’s sleep under sumptuous linens. 

We enjoyed breakfast on both mornings in the Terrace Room, a light airy space adorned with an eye watering buffet with hot items cooked to order … all making for a great start to the day. We met Estelita both mornings who could not have been more gracious and generous of spirit … a true hospitality professional who looked after our every whim. 

The Coral Bar is a must visit too … we thoroughly enjoyed our two visits whilst we were there … the cocktails were made perfectly and every team member we met genuinely wanted to make sure your time was enjoyable. 

There are many great hotels in London … and The Bloomsbury is most definitely one of those … what sets it apart are its team and for this reason we will most certainly be back. 

Thank You Team Bloomsbury for a memorable stay …",5,2024,07,31
115,Top notch!,"If you are looking to stay in and indulge in a large room, don’t stay here. If you are looking to experience the sights of London and stay in a hotel that feels like the city it’s in, with beautiful restaurants and bars, excellent staff who will work their hardest to make your stay memorable (extra special shout out to Ivan!), and fun live music to boot, then this is the place for you. Many thanks to everyone who made my birthday weekend special!",5,2024,07,31
115,Exceptional service!,"We chose this hotel due to its location and amenities however it’s service far surpassed our expectations! We stayed for 5 nights and were kindly upgraded during our stay. Our room was clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated. The location was great because it was convenient to take the tube from the airport and reach most parts of the city. It also was footsteps away from most stores and dining if you needed anything. However it was still tucked away where one can sleep without any noise. Our room rate included breakfast which was phenomenal. A great buffet to choose from but also made to order selections. However the stars of the show were the staff! At breakfast- Estelita, Maria and Aga were delightful and started our day with a smile! Charlie, Antonio and Ivan were a joy to see each day as we came and went and we were always greeted by name. Charlie had great recommendations and was always with a smile! We frequented the Dalloway and Coral Room which deserved their own stellar reviews. Do not hesitate to book!",5,2024,07,31
115,First time in London and hotel was average,"Hotel was good and we chose it because it was in the SOHO area which made it convenient.
Staff was friendly  but in my opinion overpriced for the room sizes.
Also my wife ordered room service one night as she stayed in because she wasn’t feeling well, she called and was very specific on what she wanted but when food arrived she received two orders of each items and was told that since two people were registered in the room they assumed two orders were needed so had to deal with that. To their credit, they removed the charges for second item but shouldn’t have had to deal with it to begin with.
We were also given drink vouchers when we checked in and my son asked at the Coral bar if a sórdido drink was covered with the voucher and the bartender said yes, when he paid there was another bartender and he was told that the drink wasn’t included so we had to pay for it. So overall my experience was average.",3,2024,07,29
115,LOCATION IS THE USP,"There is nothing special about this hotel except location. The neighbourhood is clam yet conveniently located.  British museum is just 10 mins walk, tube station is  very close. The rooms are however small with dated interior, Can accommodate only two adults. Breakfast is decent but repetitive. The pubs with the hotel and nearby serves the purpose of dinner very well. Stuffs are helpful.

In my opinion  if you need a conveniently located decent hotel in LOndon please stay.",4,2024,07,29
115,Hotel Bloomsbry - great London hotel choice. ,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is conveniently located in the heart of London, near the WestEnd, SoHo, British Museum and other exciting venues.  Although the rooms are not large, they are clean, modern and well maintained.  The outstanding feature of the Bloomsbury is it's staff, totally dedicated to enhancing the travellers experience.  Dale, the concierge, was extremely helpful in suggesting and scheduling dining and entertainment experiences.  Marta, the hotel manager, was helpful Resolving a billing issue and leading a highly customer oriented service level.    Mitai was very helpful in moving us in and orienting us.   The Hotel Bloomsbury is a great choice for a London stay",5,2024,07,27
115,"Wonderful comfortable hotel, great service, excellent value","My stay at the Bloomsbury exceeded my expectations in just about every way. I chose it because of its convenient location and the great reviews I’d read. Since I was going to be in London for a week, I wanted a hotel that was in walking distance from my conference but that offered more comfort and space than the usual hotels in the area. The Bloomsbury’s longer stay “time to linger” package was great value and I was upgraded to a large and comfortable classic room that had every amenity I could ask for. I arrived to find a beautiful plate of macaroons and a personal welcome note, and my bed was turned down every night. The Bloomsbury staff were amazing-so helpful and friendly, and the dining experience was excellent. Breakfast was also wonderful-I was sorry I couldn’t spend more time each morning enjoying it due to early morning meetings. I was a little surprised about the extra gratuity charge when I checked in, but having stayed there now I think the staff are deserving of every penny. I would definitely choose to stay at the Bloomsbury again on my next visit to London. It is without question one of the nicest, most welcoming hotels I’ve ever stayed in.",5,2024,07,27
115,"Will stay in the hotel again, 5 stars to all staff!","Excellent hôtel! Super friendly staff, excellent customer service throughout. We booked at the front desk as our flight was cancelled and the front desk staff were so nice to deal with and relieved the stress of travel plan changes. I can’t recall the front desk staff who helped us, I think his name is Sebastian but he provided excellent service. We asked for recommendations for musical and Ivan promptly and graciously helped us secure excellent seats at a musical for a really good price. In the evening, we went to the bar where we enjoyed some of the best cocktails I’ve had and great music. The staff were attentive and friendly, explaining the different unique cocktails. For breakfast, Estelita and her team took very good care of us and the ala carte breakfast menu was amazing. All of the staff deserve 5+ stars in this hotel. 

The room is a good size, bed is very comfortable, and the room is well stocked with the things you expect from a hotel of this rating - toiletries, coffee, water, a proper hair dryer, bathrobe, slippers, good size TV, proper black out blinds for a good night’s sleep. My only 2 suggestions will be to 1) provide some instructions on how to set the air conditioning- at one point it was too cold and at one point it was too warm/ not working. 2) please improve the water pressure for an enjoyable shower

I would definitely stay again, a super location in central london, nice clean facilities and it’s always so welcoming to have good hotel staff who provide excellent customer service.",5,2024,07,27
115,"Welcoming, capable and comfortable","The hotel was welcoming, capable and comfortable.  My spouse and I exhaled in relief and comfort after a long journey when we arrived and when we entered the room - which had maybe a few too many pillows and duvets and not quite enough storage space for our things but overall was a really nice change from some prior lodgings.  It felt a bit like an oasis but right around the corner from the multi-line Tottenham Court Road station.

Excellent breakfast and breakfast room (thank you Maria, Estelita, Aga, Gabriele, Lazlo, Mohamed, Mirel) with clearly labeled ingredients.  Very helpful reception (thank you Charlie, Tony, Steve, Ivan, Benoit and a young lady trainee whose name I didn't get but who has a dog named Misty). Restaurant help was superb (thank you hostess from Malaga and the man with spectacles who helped change our reservations).  

I might choose another location on next visit to London, but if I do I hope it replicates the qualities of The Bloomsbury.",5,2024,07,24
115,"Lovely hotel, great experience!","Great location near all the fun things you want to do in London. Friendly, professional and efficient staff, clean, charming hotel. The hotel bars and restaurant serve delicious food and beverages. We felt welcomed and appreciated during our stay. Based on our experience, I recommend The Bloomsbury!",5,2024,07,22
115,Superb!,"Love this hotel, always a pleasure coming back. 
Great service, very kind people, cozy atmosphere and great breakfast with a lot to choose from.

I would like to mention especially Ivan and Ricardo that make every trip a great experience for us - Always making that extra mile to make us feel at home.
Hope to see you soon!",5,2024,07,19
115,The best staff around,"Gregory at the front desk is a life saver. Charming, kind, and witty - he saved the day for a business trip gone awry!  Can’t recommend this hotel enough!!!  Classy, clean, and centrally located - what’s not to love. If you have the chance, don’t miss this gem!",5,2024,07,16
115,Outstanding!!,"Our stay in London at the beautiful Bloomsbury was outstanding!  The location was great and we walked almost everywhere....the British Museum, The Foundling Museum, West End theaters, great restaurants, Covent Garden and even across the Thames to the Globe and Tate Modern.  The service at the hotel was excellent.  The breakfast room service was great and staff very attentive.  The same was true for check-in and porters.  We found the concierge service really superior.  I had emailed with questions before our arrival and received very responsive and helpful replies.  We consulted on an almost daily basis for info about getting around London.  Public transportation was our preference when not walking, so getting to Wembley was easy, especially because Ivan, the concierge that day, checked to see if there was work being done on the underground line and was able to direct us via bus alternative.  We were in contact with Brian, Dale, and mostly with Ivan, at the concierge desk and they were all truly exemplary.",5,2024,07,16
115,Amazing,The place was great the pillows was very soft and comfortable amazing scenic views and all the amenities close by I will be back for sure. The staff amazing always ready to help in any queries or doubts I might had definitely one off the most beautiful places I’ve been,5,2024,07,15
115,Exceptional experience,"I recently stayed at Bloomsbury and had an exceptional experience. The staff was incredibly welcoming and attentive, ensuring all my needs were met. The room was spotless and well-appointed, offering stunning views. The amenities, including the pool and dining options, were top-notch. I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2024,07,14
115,Fantastic Hotel,First time in London. We stayed 5 nights at The Bloomsbury and I wished we could have stayed all our visit there. Great rooms very clean. Great location. Everyone was so helpful and Friendly. Brian was especially helpful. Everyone remembers your name. Great restaurants inside. Don’t miss staying at the Bloomsbury.,5,2024,07,09
115,Short break at The Bloomsbury,"We have just returned from a terrific two night stay at The Bloomsbury.  Everything was perfect & the staff, without exception, were so nice.  It is a historic building in the heart of Theatreland, close to green spaces & within walking distance of many London landmarks.  We certainly hope to return there soon.",5,2024,07,09
115,Reasonable hotel let down my shocking basic infrastructure…,"For a 5 star hotel to have such shocking WiFi is completely not acceptable in the modern world. 

It’s like being in a 2 star hotel. 

No device can connect quickly. When they do they continually drop signal. And I’m in the main part of the hotel. Hate to think what it’s like at the extremities of the property.  

Totally unacceptable.",2,2024,07,08
115,What a great place to stay!,"We were in London for a big anniversary and treated ourselves to a good hotel. Everything about it was excellent. The location, for a start, is excellent- a walk from the British Museum and Soho but without thenoise and disturbance of other central London Hotels.
The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful at all times: at reception, at breakfast and in the Coral Room, the very stylish cocktail bar. The friendliness seemed genuine rather than the slightly mechanical forced smiliness one sometimes gets.
We had a good weekend in London, and it was made considerably better by staying at the bloomsbury.",5,2024,07,07
115,One of our most favourite hotels,"If you are looking for a hotel that is central, has a fabulous feel and a truly amazing team this is the one for you!

This is our third or fourth stay and every time we visit we love it a bit more.
 They recruit and train the very best team and we are yet to come across anyone in the hotel that doesn’t go the extra mile.

Keep doing what you’re doing team Bloomsbury, you’ve got it sussed 😊",5,2024,07,06
115,No communication!,I have now emailed 7 times to cancel the booking with zero response.  I am writing this as further evidence should they dare attempt to charge me.  It also shows a lack of customer service.  You would expect more from this establishment.  I will continue to email until I receive a response.,1,2024,07,05
115,Simply the best!,"The Bloomsbury is luxury at its finest. From the moment we entered, our noses were filled with a wonderful aroma. Every employee we encountered was hospitable and kind. They all knew our names and greeted us by name each time we met. Brian, Head of Concierge, was phenomenal as well! My kids looked forward to returning each evening to the hotel to be greeted by the staff and Brian. 
The breakfasts were wonderful as well as their on site restaurant and bar. The atmosphere was friendly, warm, and cozy! If we return to London, we will be sure to stay here again. We were sad to leave this lovely place!",5,2024,07,04
115,Great location,"An overdue review of the Bloomsbury, but wanted to share our experience.  We loved our 3 night stay here.  Excellent location to the Tottenham Court Road Tube stop and within easy walking distance of the British Museum and theatres.  On a quiet street with some lovely shops.  Our Classic King room fit the bill.  Nightly turndown service.  The included morning breakfast buffet was not only delicious, but also beautifully presented.  Professional and friendly staff.  Walls are a bit thin as we could hear the folks in the room next to us along with people chatting in the hallways.  We would eagerly return!",5,2024,07,03
115,Lovely hotel close to the London West End theater district,"Staying at The Bloomsbury Hotel was a marvelous experience.  We were in London at the conclusion of a trip through England and Scotland and wanted to stay close to the theaters in the West End.  We were looking for a hotel that was intimate and fun.  And we found it in The Bloomsbury.  The location is perfect for walking to many of the theaters.  The staff is obviously very well-trained.  They are attentive, friendly, professional and fun.  Everyone remembers your name.  The Coral Room (bar and restaurant) is magical.  Just walking in there made us happy.  Fun place for a drink and light food choices.  Dinner at The Dalloway was also first rate with lovely outside seating.  Overall, it is one of the best hotel experiences we have had.  Check it out.  You won't be disappointed.",5,2024,07,02
115,Hidden Gem,"Beautiful Boutique hotel in the heart of London. Elegant rooms, relaxing bars and terrace and a stones throw from covent garden and theatre land. Efficient, friendly service with welcoming doormen make this a hidden gem!
We will definitely return.",5,2024,07,01
115,Gorgeous Coven Garden hotel,"I practically made a full time job out of researching hotels for our first time trip to London.  The Bloomsbury did not disappoint.  From the moment of arrival via private hotel transportation which was punctual and easy to locate at LHR, we were warmly welcomed and cared for by the friendly and attentive staff including Ivan and others.  Our room was a Classic King.  While small, it was also very comfortable and beautifully furnished.  Breakfast included cooked to order items as well as a lovely buffet of meats, cheeses, pastries, fruits and nearly everything you could think of.  Service was consistently warm, friendly and attentive.  We enjoyed cocktails in the stunning Coral Lounge and wish we had had the time to take advantage of the other hotel amenities including tea and dinner.  The location was excellent for walking within Covent Garden and Soho but also to Buckingham Palace and Tower of London although the latter two locations were much further but we loved the walk!  Tube stop is a couple of blocks away and there are many shops, pubs and restaurants within easy proximity.  Highly recommend.",5,2024,06,21
115,Best part about our London trip was our hotel,"What can I say, from booking to getting us back to the airport to go home, Bloomsbury and their staff took care of us with a smile.  The ladies answering my emails regarding booking rooms for our family of 5 were fantastic.  I wish I remembered their names.  They responded timely and reassured me of the arrangements I requested.  They made us feel so welcomed as soon as we arrived.  The porter Antonio so kind and always willing to help and answer questions with a smile.  The concierge gentlemen, Ivan, Dale and Brian.  The all booked our transport/scheduled our sight seeing tours and advised us on some very good restaurants.  I cannot say anything but fantastic service with a smile.  The ladies who cleaned our rooms and performed turn down service, our hotel room was always looked after and clean.  The dining staff. Maria, Estrelita,  Patricia, Tetiana, Yulila, Mohammad, Meryl, Antonio, Jair.. what a nice group of people to greet me in the morning with my cup of coffee and my preferred table.   One day, we were leaving very early for a sight seeing tour and Maria made us breakfast sandwiches and pastries.

The hotel is quiet even though it is close to busy streets.  Our room which was the classic King, albeit a little cosy was very comfortable, quiet and comfortable. The bed and bedding were so luxurious.  The other room we booked for  my nieces and friend was the Deluxe King Room.  Bloomsbury rearranged the room to accommodate for 2 twin beds and a very comfortable rollaway.  My family were very happy with their rooms.

We booked tea service in the Dalloway Terrace and the service there was also fantastic.  The sandwiches to the pastries were delicious.  We had drinks at the Coral Bar and the bar tender and service was also amazing. They even gave us Americans a bucket of ice to bring to our room.

Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this hotel.  We were very sad leaving London and Bloomsbury.  We stayed here for 6 nights.",5,2024,06,20
115,Opulence Luxury Comfort,"The Bloomsbury never fails to impress with its comfort, opulence and service. We always know what to expect from this fine hotel. The level of luxury, plus friendliness of its staff keeps us coming back for repeated visits.

Special mention should be made to staff members Ajeena, Maria, Estrelita, and Gabriela.

Thank you, Bloomsbury, and see you again.",5,2024,06,19
115,Best hotel in London,"Staying at the Bloomsbury Hotel was an exceptional, outstanding experience from beginning to end. The way we were warmly greeted was so welcoming, and everyone was so thoughtful and helpful, nothing seemed too much, and they remembered the smallest details about our preferences that made us feel very special. 

The quality of the service and presentation at breakfast, at the bar or restaurant was marvellous as well, and the hotel itself was fabulous. The hotel is situated in the heart of London and was in easy walking distance to most theatres and restaurants for us, and Tottenham Court Road Tube Station linked us to anywhere else we wished to go. I can’t recommend it highly enough and look forward to staying there again in the future. We thank all the staff for making it the magical experience it was for my daughter and I :)",5,2024,06,19
115,Absolutely magical!,"If I could recommend one hotel in London it would be this one, it is absolutely magical. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, everyone was incredibly kind and and made us feel so welcome and truly like we were at home. 

The hotel is beautifully decorated and transports you back into another era and every aspect has been so thoughtfully and stylishly put together. The signature scent of the hotel is subtle and absolutely delicious, I wish I had of asked if we were able to purchase it as I absolutely loved it. 

However the thing that makes this hotel stand out from all the others, is the people that work there. I had shared with the team that it was my mothers birthday and they truly went above and beyond to create the most wonderful stay for us. They were so incredibly thoughtful and kind, I wanted to particularly thank Ricardo, the guest experience manager and his team for creating the best hotel experience that my mother and I have ever had - we will absolutely be back and hopefully very soon!",5,2024,06,19
115,London's very best!,"Our children sent us to London because we love everything British (and of course, The Beatles) and we had never been abroad.  I researched the trip and booked The Bloomsbury Hotel.  It did not disappoint. We adored the place, from the friendly greetings of the doorman, greeters and staff, the welcoming check-in process and each and every employee we encountered. They really made you feel like you were special.  The concierge staff went out of their way to answer our questions and help us, in particular, Brian, Dale and Ivan.  

The menus in the Dalloway Room and the Coral Room were top rate.   Service was outstanding and afternoon tea was delightful. Our room was furnished beautifully with all of the amenities you could wish for.  We were put on a pedestal for our 10 day visit. We cannot properly express how wonderful our time was at The Bloomsbury Hotel.  We highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a very special experience.

Kathy and Rich Cirlincione, Livingston, NJ",5,2024,06,17
115,"Attractive, quiet hotel not far from the West End",Loved the Bloomsbury. Wanted to stay close to the West End. It's kind of tucked away which makes it a quiet hotel with a nice restaurant and beautiful inside bar. The room was super comfortable and the breakfast offerings were outstanding with a nice buffet and several menu offerings. Maria and rest of the breakfast staff were wonderful. Our concierge Ivan was of great help to us. We stayed prior to a cruise and would definitely return.,5,2024,06,14
115,Great Hotel- Love it!,"Great Beautiful Hotel, with great service. Clean, and well decorated.  Lovely room. Large room, with great amenities. Convenient to walking to everything, in theater district. Many pubs and restarants near by. So enjoyable to stay here!  Priced well.",5,2024,06,14
115,Great service and ambiance,"We had lunch at Dalloway Terrace.  Ambiance and decor were very nice.  Service was great as well.  I forgot my hat in the lobby, and Antonio was so kind to find me to return it.  As we walked to the terrace, we walked through the bar.  It looked very cozy; I would come back another time for a drink there.",5,2024,06,13
115,New go to hotel in London,Excellent hotel in a great location if one would like to be near the theater district or the British Museum. The rooms were larger than most London Hotels. The bathroom is modern but on the smaller side. The hotel had an excellent breakfast and has two lovely hotel bars. The staff is very helpful and accommodating. It will be our new go to hotel in London.,5,2024,06,10
115,Don't make a mistake...,"Admittedly, I made a mistake in my booking and arrived the following Friday of the original reservation date. The front desk person happily accommodated me for the 2 nights upon my arrival.  It is a lovely hotel, and I had a great stay... until I returned home and found I had been charged a no show fee of a full nights stay.  

I understand the need for the policy however, I stayed at the hotel. Mistakes happen. At no time was I told that I would be charged a no show fee (I may have stayed elsewhere). The hotel refused to give me a reduction on the charge and in fact never returned my email request. 

Unfortunately, this was my 3rd and last stay at a Doyle Collection hotel. There are too many other hotels to choose from in London. Small gestures of good customer service go a long way.",2,2024,06,10
115,Absolutely perfect,"Picked the Bloomsbury for a special occasion trip and the hotel really did make it special.

Couldn't have wished for somewhere more perfect in every aspect: door to door in 45 mins from Heathrow via the Elizabeth line; theatre district, great shopping and restaurants all within strolling distance. And the hotel itself was just incredible - luxurious without being stuffy, amazing staff, beautiful building and decor, not one but two great bars serving fabulous cocktails, wonderful menu for breakfast (elevated beyond the usual full English, although that's also available!).

There's no doubt I'll be back - staying at The Bloomsbury will be the special occasion in the future!",5,2024,06,09
115,Five star without exception.,"Once again a wonderful stay, would highly recommend this hotel. The staff are so friendly and accommodating and we got a lovely upgrade. It’s right in the centre but our room was very quiet. Very handy for all the Tube lines and Elizabeth line.",5,2024,06,08
115,Great place at a great location,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Our room was very nice. Great location…plenty to see and do within a short walk.  The staff is very friendly and attentive, especially Maria, Estelita, Lazlo, Patricia and Tetiana. High tea at the Coral Room is worth the experience.",5,2024,06,07
115,The Bloomsbury Hotel,"If you’re looking for a high quality place to stay in central London, I would highly recommend The Bloomsbury Hotel. The staff are incredible and the service was excellent. Its location was great, Close to the underground and buses and easy to navigate to anywhere we wanted to go",5,2024,06,03
115,great,"first of all, i just want to extend my gratitude to Antonio (porter) who was very friendly and helpful during my visit! Lovely place and great location in central london with amazing facilities, would definitely stay here the next time i come visit london!",5,2024,06,03
115,Beautiful hotel and top notch staff,"I would actually give this hotel a 4.5 if I could.  This was our second stay.  The first one being two years ago.  We did have an issue with our room on arrival, but it was dealt with professionally and promptly.  We had booked a Deluxe Queen and requested a walk in shower.  We were given a Deluxe Queen on the 8th floor that had very low ceilings and a tiny, narrow tub (no walk in shower).  To be fair, I understand that they cannot honor every request, but I also thought that being repeat guests would give us  a leg up.  Perhaps they weren't aware that we were repeat guests.  And, on our first stay here, I had also requested a walk in shower and it was granted.  Anyway, my husband is a large guy and it just wasn't going to work.  They upgraded us to a Deluxe King with a walk in shower.  Although the room was right next to the elevator, which was heard very clearly from our room, the additional space, higher ceilings, and walk in shower were much appreciated and enjoyed.  
The aesthetic in their rooms creates a serene and cozy environment.  Both the room and the bathroom were IMMACULATE!  This is coming from someone who is not easy to please when it comes to cleanliness of hotel rooms.  So kudos to their housekeeping staff.  The entire hotel is beautiful and well maintained.  Every staff member that we ran into were lovely and accommodating.  
We also enjoyed having access to the Coral Room after a long day of sightseeing just to sit and relax with a drink.  It has such a great vibe.  
We only availed ourselves of the breakfast one morning as we didn't find either the hot items or buffet items to our liking.  
And lastly, the location of this hotel is perfect for all the sightseeing you want to do around London.  We either walked to our destination or took a taxi if we were in a rush.  And the staff is more than happy in getting a taxi for you.
If we're ever back in London, which I imagine will probably be the case as it's one of our favorite cities, I would definitely consider another stay here.",4,2024,06,02
115,First trip to The Bloomsbury and not disappointed,"This was our first experience at the Bloomsbury and it didn’t disappoint. From the porter taking our bag at the foot of the steps to him announcing our name at reception, the service encountered from all the staff was above and beyond. It is a beautiful boutique hotel in a very good location and we can’t wait to return. The bars and restaurants were all top class but the staff really made the difference, well done to all.",5,2024,05,30
115,A Classy Hotel With Exceptional Service,"We stayed in several hotels during our recent trip to England. Service was excellent at all of them, but the Bloomsbury was outstanding. From beginning to end the staff made us feel special. Thank you to Shannon, Mariya, Patricia, Gabrielle and Ulia! Special thanks to Ajeena and Mohammad! 
Things we particularly liked about the hotel: 1)The Bar is absolutely gorgeous. Drinks were served in beautiful glasses along with dishes of almonds and little crackers. There's a lovely, spacious room with comfortable chairs and small tables, as well as seating at the bar.  It's a classy-yet-lively environment. 2) The breakfast is amazing -- delicious custom-prepared dishes along with a varied, bountiful buffet. Everything beautifully presented and excellent quality. 3) Lovely sitting room off the lobby to relax in. 4) Little treats in our room -- cookies, chocolates, tall bottles of still and sparkling water along with the usual coffee/tee set-up. 5) Easy walking distance to the Brittish Museum and Covent Garden",5,2024,05,29
115,"The loveliest place to stay in London, truly!  :)","From check-in to check-out, the entire team at The Bloomsbury was unbelievably warm, personable, and attentive. I've never seen this level of hospitality! Thank you so much to Carmine, Cristiano, and everyone else we met that went out of their way to make our stay so easy, comfortable, and truly (TRULY) memorable. 

The hotel is lovely, with the most dreamily decorated, pleasantly fragrant lobby spaces. :) Our room was so comfortable, and all of the housekeeping was done with such evident care. The team was also very accommodating when it came to holding bags, a very early AM checkout, etc. 

Thank you all, so so much. 100% recommend & 100% hope to revisit!",5,2024,05,28
115,A hidden treasure,"The welcome from the entire staff was phenomenal. Every time you enter the door and every time you exit they greet you, are ready with directions or food suggestions, and genuinely care about your well being and accommodations.  The downstairs breakfast is a wonderful experience to grabbing a bite and running to wherever you need to go to having a nice relaxing breakfast, served by the kindest people. The rooms are nice  and comfortable. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my stay with my family.",4,2024,05,28
115,In London for the Chelsea Flower Show,"Superb hotel, fantastic staff.  All was perfect.  Great breakfasts.  Dinner on the Dallaway Terrace exquisite after a day at the Chelsea flower Show.  The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful.  Very comfy bed.  How could it be bettered.",5,2024,05,26
115,Fabulous hotel in perfect location,"The staff of the Bloomsbury is top notch - helpful, kind, engaged. Everything you could want when traveling. The property is beautiful and well cared for. The rooms are lovely, beds comfortable, and amenities great. The restaurants are top notch. Best breakfast in London.",5,2024,05,25
115,The Ultimate in Boutique Hotels,The Bloomsbury Hotel is the epitome of a boutique hotel.  Even though I was communicating with the hotel from a different country they were always quick to reply to my inquiries.  They made sure all of my requests were managed before our arrival.  The hotel is located in a nice part of London on a quiet street.  It has an intimate setting and the decor is lovely and inviting.  Our room was beautifully decorated and comfortable.  We loved the duvet on the bed and had the best nights sleep.  We learned that the room we stayed in will be renovated with updated bathrooms which will be a big improvement since it currently has a bathtub/shower that can be challenging to get out of.  The staff were very helpful and always friendly and accommodating.  We were traveling with friends and had recommended that they stay at the same hotel and they were as thrilled about the accommodations as we were.  We will definitely stay here again when we visit London.  A perfect choice.,5,2024,05,24
115,"""Great experience when in London""","Wonderful location, great people and a very "" English experience""
Within walking distance of most everything you will want to do during your stay in central London
Stay here once when in London, you will  never be satisfied at a ""lesser hotel"" again",5,2024,05,23
115,Luxury London experience.,"We have stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel many times over the years and find it the perfect London base. Location is excellent for the Tube, theatres, shopping and the British Museum. The decor is very British, stylish and comfortable and the rooms are equipped with every convenience. Breakfast is a lavish buffet with individual service for hot dishes. No hotel is better than its staff and the team - many of whom have been here for years - remember us and go out of their way to make our stay confortable and enjoyable.",5,2024,05,23
115,Beautiful Bloomsbury!,"We spent six glorious nights at this well located Covent Garden hotel and would return tomorrow if we could. From the welcoming emails even before we arrived to the warm welcome and tour of the hotel restaurants and fitness center (top notch!!)to the escorting us to our room and explaining the many amenities… I could go on and on about this lovely, historic five star hotel. The staff is exceptional and so helpful.",5,2024,05,21
115,What an amazing and unforgettable stay!,"What a find! The Bloomsbury Hotel is a jewel of a hotel tucked away just off Great Russell Street away from the hustle and bustle of city life. Not only is it a beautiful hotel, with amazing rooms and wonderful food, but the guest service and care was outstanding! 

I went with my mother to celebrate her 80th, and from the moment we arrived to when we left today, we were were looked after superbly! Nothing was too much trouble and my mum who suffers from mobility issues was helped round the hotel by the lovely caring staff. Thank you to everybody at The Bloomsbury,  especially the concerige team, you all  made my mother's birthday trip truly special and one she won't forget!",5,2024,05,19
115,5 star plus experience,"Probably the best hotel we have stayed in. The personal service makes this place. Every member of staff greets you with a smile and is interested in your day. The breakfast team of Maria, Estelita, Mohamed, Tiana, Gabriela and Lazlo are excellent",5,2024,05,19
115,A boutique hotel with excellent service,"Overall it's a very nice stay experience. From check-in to check-out, the staffs are always helpful and friendly. The receptionist Yijiao made checked in for me, she was patient and also had a brief induction for me about the hotel outlets, also the neighbourhood and shared some travel guide for me since I'm a solo traveller, I do felt being considered as an individual instead of a normal customer... so outstanding service!  I went to The Bloomsbury club as it's her recommendation, and it was awesome! I love the decoration style and the vibe in the bar- cosy and not too noisy. 

Expect for the staffs, the hotel itself is an absolute treasure, convenient location and unique decoration, it's a very boutique property located in city centre. However, it would be great if there's a Spa in the property.",5,2024,05,17
115,Great Central London Hotel to Recommend,"Short review: 
Room: 4 stars 
Service: 4.5 stars
Location: 5 stars

The Bloomsbury Hotel is definitely a great choice for staying in Central London. With Tottenham station very close by along with several bus stops and services, it's easy to get around to any part of London from The Bloomsbury. There's also quite a few theaters within walking distance, but the hotel was surprisingly quiet at night (to get a good night's rest). 

With the classic room and King size bed, it was sufficient space for us and our luggage. There was a generous size closet, along with ample storage with a dresser and desk. The only gripe about the room is the shower/tub in the bathroom. The glass door for the shower tub was quite short and we felt we had to decide between having a good water pressure for the shower (with the consequence of water being splashed all over the floor outside the tub) or sacrifice a lower water pressure to prevent water overly splashing. 

The service at the Bloomsbury was extremely good. An overwhelming majority of the Bloomsbury staff were extremely nice and helpful (~95%) with only a few staff members that were not as hospitable or helpful as most of the other staff. A few names to thank during our stay: Emmanual, Ajeena, Antonio and all the porters. 

I would definitely consider staying again at The Bloomsbury Hotel!",5,2024,05,12
115,Wonder Experience! More than worth it.,"All the staff were very professional, courteous, and genuine. The food was excellent.
The breakfast was one of the best highlights of our stay. The breakfast team, Estelita, Maria, Gabriela, Patrica, Lazlo, Mirel, Cosmin, Mohammad, and Tetiana all deserve to be named in our review. Their constant attention and the delicious hot food made each morning begin in the best possible way.
The front staff was also the most courteous and helpful of anywhere we have stayed. Asif was an outstanding host.  The Conceirge, Brian, was instrumental in reservations and sorting our airport transportation. Edward, Steve and Carmine made us feel at home, coming and going.
We will be happy to stay there again.",5,2024,05,11
115,Thank you,"After a week at the hotel, I would like to highly recommend the Bloomsbury Hotel, excellent location near Oxford and near the main line train station, the service of all the staff is excellent and wholeheartedly from the moment we arrived they gave an atmosphere of home and family, the breakfast is varied with a menu from which you can choose the main course, the buffet is very meticulous, The rooms are a bit small but definitely enough for a couple, the whole week everything was clean and the room service went above and beyond to make sure everything was to our liking, we are already waiting for the next time.",5,2024,05,11
115,Well located hotel with incredible staff,"Splendid experience from check-in to check-out.  Breakfast is a particular highlight with the team led by Maria, who has stunning memory and care.  Equally excellent were Estelita, Patricia, Gabriela, Mohamed, Tetiane, and Cosmiu.  Can't wait to return.  Rooms are well sized and cozy with enough room to stretch out.",5,2024,05,11
115,Excellent choice,"Excellent choice: beautiful decoration, extremely profesional and attentive staff, small details at the room that makes a perfect stay.  Hotel is walking distance to SoHo, British Museum and Elizabeth Line train, directo to Heathrow in 30 minutes. Great location!",5,2024,05,10
115,My stay at the Bloomsbury london,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Bloomsbury Hotel during my visit to London, and I was absolutely delighted! The hotel is beautifully designed and offers a cozy atmosphere that instantly makes you feel welcome.

The highlight of my stay was undoubtedly the incredibly friendly and accommodating staff. Antonio, Tony, Carmine, and Ivan went above and beyond to make my stay as enjoyable as possible. Their warm hospitality and willingness to assist at any time made my stay unforgettable.",5,2024,05,09
115,Fabulous Hotel!,"This is the nicest hotel ! Our room was spacious and comfortable with an excellent turn down service. My daughter and I felt right at home. Antonio was exceptional. He was very knowledgeable about the area and helpful with all our requests. 
The front desk staff were so gracious 
My only complaint is that we just had one night here!",5,2024,05,09
115,Thank you Antonio,Our afternoon tea at the Dalloway Terrace was extraordinary. Extraordinary service and extraordinary welcoming by the porter Antonio! Thank you you’re a very good man. It was a very good experience for a french woman like me … all was very 60’s british… i loved it!,5,2024,05,08
115,10/10 - Incredible Customer Service,"The best hotel experience we've had, ever! The team were fantastic, from the door men to breakfast. Estella, Tatiana, Gabriella and Mohammed made accommodations to our vegan breakfast daily which got us off to a great start each day. Breakfast was 10/10. Marta in guest relations was incredibly kind and welcoming, she went above and beyond to personalize our stay, thank you to the lovely Marta. The environment, quality of the rooms and hotel, plus the Coral Room were incredible. I was concerned about noise as the hotel is central London, however, it's tucked away with no noise at all. This is unheard of in London. The Bloomsbury is a true gem, best customer service we've ever received. We look forward to going back when next in London and explore the additional hotels in the Doyle Collection. Thank you to the lovely team, you made our trip extra special. Please take care, David & Adrienne",5,2024,05,08
115,A divine spot in the center of London,"There's a reason we've stayed at the Bloomsbury 7 or 8 times now, and that's because it is a divine spot in the center of London––but tucked away, so you rarely feel trapped by the chaos of this extremely bustling tourist district. From the moment you walk in, you are greeted by a wonderfully scented and cozily decorated lobby, and the amazing staff. Special shoutout to the manager, Marta, who helped me book a second room when my husband fell ill, and very, very kindly upgraded me, given the stress of the situation. Peter, Sebastian, Eremilta––the entire staff that I interacted with were so friendly and helpful. 

Of course the rooms are small, as all big-city hotel rooms are, and they probably could be better laid out (the tight spaces sometimes require more maneuvering than hotels in similar cities, especially the bathrooms). But they are supremely functional, well air-conditioned (a must in hotter months!) and the King beds are very comfortable. The Coral Room and the speakeasy are destinations for people who are not guests, and we never miss a chance to visit. 

The great thing about the Bloomsbury is its location. You are in walking distance from almost all the theaters, Foyles books, Dishoom, so many great neighborhoods. And if you want to travel out to cooler shopping neighborhoods like Shoreditch, etc, the Tottenham Court Station can take you anywhere. There are plenty of buses nearby, too, so it's just really convenient. I wish the breakfast was a more traditional hot spread and a little less fussy, but it is a great way to start the day and the hours are generous.

So, yes, do be prepared for the surrounding area to get a bit wild with crowds, but the Bloomsbury is a haven and I can't really imagine staying anywhere else, especially as a fan of Virginia Woolf.",5,2024,05,07
115,Overpriced for the size of the room,We stayed in a classic queen room which was very small but very well decorated and clean. Very comfortable bed. The shower door opened onto the controls so it was impossible to turn the water on without getting wet. The toilet paper could do with an upgrade. Breakfast was excellent.,4,2024,05,06
115,a very special London stay,"We just had an amazing stay at The Bloomsbury.  Having lived in London many years back, i knew it would be the best location for us.  It is centrally located to everything and there is a tube a block away.  It was a birthday trip and Asif went beyond to make it special for me.  But all the staff are extremely friendly and helpful .  The bar is lively with the best cocktails in London.  Cannot wait to return!!",5,2024,05,01
115,Visiting Central London?.....Guarantee THE BEST London hotel experience!,"Without doubt THE BEST service and staff, enjoyed every minute of our stay. Highly recommended!, my only disappointment was there was no room available for our unexpected extended stay, I would have booked in a heartbeat! It would be difficult to elevate one aspect of the incredible experience over another as all dovetailed seamlessly, with great personalised service, superb ambience and high quality rooms! The front door porter staff made us feel like we were coming home! the breakfast crew made the start of the morning a breeze and the concierge staff even found a solution for my safety pin saga (ever tried buying safety pins in central London?, yes I'd have thought it would be a breeze too! with Pharmacies and supermarkets nearby, it wasn't!) The Morning of the London Marathon  as I had not been provided any with my start pack to pin my number. I will endeavour to stay here every time I visit central London 10/10 Do Not hesitate to book!",5,2024,04,30
115,Attentive Staff and Beautiful Atmosphere,"Attentive Staff and Beautiful atmosphere and location! Every time we entered or exited the building we were met with friendly door staff. From the moment of check in to our check out we felt welcomed and remembered. The Breakfast was sensational and the team were wonderful (they always remembered our coffee orders) and were friendly without being over bearing.
The entire building is so wonderful with various rooms and lounges to relax in, and the Coral Bar was stunning!
I highly recommend staying here - the location is also fantastic! Very close to the tube and many famous sites of London.",5,2024,04,27
115,Top Class Hotel - Blooming Brillant,"Staff are so polite and friendly- just couldn’t do enough- really professional, and the atmosphere was so welcoming and relaxing.

Definitely worth a visit",5,2024,04,26
115,Aussie couple in London,"Visiting London for the marathon and could not have chosen a better place. Location spot on - within walking distance to countless restaurants, bars, cafes and incredible tourist venues. Staff so warm and accomodating. Particularly Maria - greeting us personally each morning for breakfast by name. What an amazing woman! Door staff also so helpful, engaging and warm. Can’t recommend enough.",5,2024,04,25
115,"Stylish luxury, fantastic service","Despite being just a short walk from the junction of Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street, one of the busiest places on earth, the Bloomsbury Hotel is a quiet haven of stylish luxury.

The hotel interiors are beautifully designed and well appointed but what really struck us was the superb level of service from the friendly staff. We were well looked after from the moment the doorman Tony welcomed us from our taxi and escorted us inside.

One highlight of our stay was afternoon tea in the Coral Room, a wonderful setting with delicious food and, once again, fantastic service.

We will be back again as soon as we can.",5,2024,04,25
115,Another wonderful stay at the Bloomsbury,"Another beautiful stay at the Bloomsbury! From the wonderful smell as you walk into reception to the fantastic breakfast the next morning, this hotel never fails to impress. 
The staff are attentive to your every need and remember the details, which makes this hotel a cut above the rest.",5,2024,04,24
115,Absolutely fabulous hotel,"Absolutely fabulous hotel, from the moment you walk in the front door you feel special. All of the staff were attentive and friendly from reception to breakfast serving. The room was beautiful, the bed was so comfy I didn't want to leave! Breakfast had a great selection of continental and menu ordering. Location of the hotel is great, close to everything but you feel like you're in a haven away from the busy streets. Highly recommend.",5,2024,04,23
115,"Exceptional hotel, amazing staff, great location.","This hotel is so beautiful with the most professional service I've seen ever and extraordinarily welcoming and helpful staff. Since our very first minute in the hotel throughout our stay for four nights we felt like looked after and all our experience was fantastic.
The reception team on check in with Sebastian who checked in us in 3-4 minutes, Suhaina, the concierge team with Ivan on the desk, Peter and Mihai. Very special thanks to Marta De Santis for everything she did for us about the room, the amenities, the welcome drink.
What to say about the amazing breakfast with so many choices and also the Coral room with their amazing cocktails and friendly staff.
Well done, well done, well done!!!
Thank you very much to all of you dear people!!!",5,2024,04,22

We would definitely stay there again.",5,2024,04,22
115,"Great hotel: location, beautiful and kind and greeting staff","Wonderful boutique hotel with great location. 

Antonio (porter) was cheerful and welcoming every moment.

 The lady at breakfast got my name first day and every day greeted me by the name. 

Those are the small details that count! 

Muchas gracias",5,2024,04,21
115,Top of their game,"I’ve had the luxury of staying at The Bloomsbury three times over the last nine months. Basically my last three trips to London. The staff are on point; everyone cares about the experience of their clients from the minute you walk in the door to the time you check out. Hats off and top job always the whole team and a special shout out to Ricardo, John, Sam, Tamvee, and Zhuel-Miguel. The food and drinks are amazing and the rooms (esp if you’re a member) are unlike anything you’ll experience in a large city. I almost don’t want to write this review because I want it to remain a hidden gem.",5,2024,04,19
115,Loved The Bloomsbury Hotel!,"My husband and I spent 4 nights at The Bloomsbury in early April. We were there for both work and pleasure 
From the minute we checked in to the day we left London we received exceptional service at this hotel.
In particular, Maria was a welcome sight at our delicious breakfasts each morning. She greeted us by name on our first day and was always attentive throughout our meal. 
When we checked in, Xijiao was so helpful and kind. She assisted us with our checkout as well along with Gregory. 
The bars at the hotel where fantastic and we made use of a free cocktail that the hotel provided us when we checked in. The downstairs bar had live music and amazing cocktails 
This hotel is in a great location as well. Especially if you’re doing the touristy thing like we were. It is also very close to a tube station which was great. 
The room was well tended to with daily turndown service 
All in all a fantastic stay for us at this hotel",5,2024,04,18
115,Highly recommended!,"Great hotel.
Extraordinary service. The staff are so kind and welcoming (Special thanks to Asif!).

The rooms are spacious and very clean!

Thank you,

Kafri family",5,2024,04,16
115,All round fantastic luxury hotel.,"Super friendly and helpful staff throughout. Excellent breakfast. Enjoyed the gym which is pretty well stocked for most workouts. Beds are comfy, and are rooms are quiet. Great location, walking distance to most amenities. Hard to fault the hotel on any aspect really, maybe the bar could open later. I also left something behind after I checked out, and the hotel arranged to have it returned to me, which was much appreciated.",5,2024,04,16
115,Very special experience,"This hotel is phenomenal. It is beautiful. The staff was so personable and could not be more helpful. Every day we felt like VIP  guests and almost like family. We stayed for seven days and enjoyed all of the restaurants/cocktail bars. The food and drink and atmosphere could not be beat. The beds were extremely comfortable  and the turn down service was really special. The eggs, Benedict, and breakfast were the best we’ve ever had. You must enjoy some time in the gorgeous Coral Room! 
I wish we had our afternoon tea there instead of Fortnum and Mason! 
The location was convenient to attractions, (though walking through walking through Charing Cross Rd was not our favorite), but it was close to the Underground.",5,2024,04,15
115,Every hotel needs a George,"Just back from 2 nights here with my daughter ( late teens) . Its  while since we've been but we have missed it. I'm glad we were back. The new layout with the side entrance isn't quite as impressive,  but the new Coral room is. The staff were as lovely  and amazing as ever. My daughter is gluten intolerant and they were very careful when we ate. Breakfast  had several options and the afternoon tea was fantastic.  Both the normal and the gluten free. Room was very comfortable,  had everything  you needed with nightly turn down, water and tea replaced and towels as needed. Breakfast had great choice and the doormen and Concierge were always there to welcome you back. The staff were all fantastic  but George the manager in the Coeal room was outstanding  , from recommending drinks to providing GF bar snacks ( thanks for the chocolates) and dealing with a small issue in an amazing  way, he covered everything with care and attention and made you feel so welcome and valued  he is a true asset",5,2024,04,13
115,Exceptional Hotel and Wonderful Experience!,"The staff was exceptional and the room was top notch. Everything was perfect for our first time in London and I’m happy that I chose this hotel.

I will definitely stay there again.",5,2024,04,10
115,Beautiful hotel,"This is a rather late review but I was recently looking at my photos and remembered what a fantastic weekend my family and I had staying at the Bloomsbury.

The Bloomsbury is stunning. Every room is beautiful, and the bar was particularly special. The rooms were spacious and the bathroom well equipped. We had our 15 month old baby with us and the cot was perfect, and we really appreciated the added touches. 

The staff were all excellent, with special mentions to Estepona, Andreea and Mohammed who looked after us at breakfast. 

We can’t wait to return!",5,2024,04,10
115,The Bloomsbury - The very BEST,"One of the very best hotels we've ever visited!!
Perfect hosting, caring for the guest personally. 
Peter, Ivan, Ricardo, Suhaina ,and all other stuff members were wonderful people, helping us organising our vacation and meeting our needs. Breakfast was amazing, rich,  delicious . Our rooms were super cosy and upgraded, cleaned twice a day. Beds and bathroom were super comfortable.
We can't wait to come back 😊",5,2024,04,10
115,Brilliant,"We stayed here for 4 nights and could not fault the hotel. The staff were brilliant, the food and beverage was excellent and the location was very central.  It was my birthday and the staff went to every effort to ensure it was special.  I would have no hesitation in staying again or recommending the hotel.",5,2024,04,09
115,Experience ruined,"We stayed in room 509 for three nights. 

Pros:
 - Close to a tube station.
 - Close to shopping on Oxford Street.
 - Good size room for London.
 - The staff and service were very good.

Cons:
 - The entrance to the hotel is off the street and on a private road. One entrance is from a main road, the other from a dirty lane. It's not the most convenient. 
 - The bathroom was tiny. I could barely take a shower. 
 - The area around the hotel is dodgy. There's a seedy casino nearby, and I feel like it attracts a bad crowd. 
 - We had a terrible experience on our final night. I can't be 100% sure because we managed to avoid a confrontation, but I believe somebody followed my wife and I into the hotel - onto the hotel premises - intending to rob us. It was a very strange situation. We managed to avoid him by quickly diverting into the hotel bar rather than proceeding to the elevators, where I believe he would get in with us and follow us to our room. He quickly disappeared when we made it towards the bar. I reported it to the hotel staff, and their response was excellent. They immediately scoured the entire building looking for the guy but couldn't find anybody. My only concern was that they didn't refer to the CCTV footage like I had asked because they would've seen everything if they did. Maybe the cameras are there for show and don't record anything. This single experience ruined what was a decent stay. 

Let me be clear again... The hotel staff were BRILLIANT. What happened to us was not their fault; they did what they could to help.",3,2024,04,08
115,Brilliant hotel and super friendly staff,"We stayed for one night this weekend and we were very impressed. We’ve been coming to London for years and our favourite area is around Covent Garden. We booked this hotel based on the reviews and they weren’t wrong. 
Lovely warm welcome from doorman and reception. Seemed very genuine and super helpful. Lovely communal areas and very pretty bar. 
Our room was nice and clean and the bed was really comfortable. Returned to a turn down service and birthday treats. 
Breakfast was very impressive. I’m normally underwhelmed by buffets but this was fabulous. The fruits, yogurts, granola and fresh honey beautiful. Again the staff were so friendly and polite, referring to us personally throughout. 
We’ll definitely stay again and has become our hotel of choice.",5,2024,04,08
115,Just outstanding at every turn..,"The Bloomsbury is a hidden jewel in Central London. The hotel has all the refineries and touches that made this stay so decadent. First class service, genuine and warm staff that go the extra mile at all times. I loved, loved, the fresh flower arrangements. They were everywhere, in all the common areas, on many surfaces — so elegant and classy - the breakfast pancakes were perfectly fluffy and melted in your mouth. The turn down service each evening made for a perfect ending to our very busy 5 days in London exploring the city.  The King Deluxe Room worth every penny.  Spacious, high end personal care items and toiletries, bottled water supplied in abundance - and the room was clean with all the little extras popped in that made this stay one that won’t be forgotten. We will be back!",5,2024,04,06
115,Excellent choice,"Enjoyed the location, it was very close to lots of attractions and the tube. The Staff was very helpful and they work very hard. The Room was very nice and had lots of amenities. We really enjoyed The afternoon tea it was lovely. The bed was very comfortable I had a great nights sleep.",5,2024,04,05
115,Oh what a night it was it really was,"We arrived at the Bloomsbury in the middle of a rainstorm and were greeted by  a guy whose name  I think was Anthony but can’t be sure, sorry, gave us a warm welcome and knew our names. On walking through to the bar Giorgio greeted us and showed us to a lovely table for two. So far so great. The lovely Mary attended to us and brought us two glasses of champagne followed by a Martini and a Manhattan both made so very well but don’t know the mixologists name - sorry. 
Into the restaurant where Madeleine looked after us all evening. She was so very attentive, listened very carefully to what we wanted and delivered exactly. A glass of white wine, another cocktail ahead of the meal. 
Thanks to the chef - monkfish starter, steak and massaman curry for mains, both so very tasty and perfectly presented.
Finally down to the Bloomsbury club for a whisky and brandy where we were served by Alex (I think) very attentive and informed about what else goes on at the weekend. 
And to bed, very comfortable and huge.
Breakfast - let’s just say they must have all been having an off day. Service poor, and food…...",5,2024,04,04
115,Exceptional Experience!,"This has been the best hotel experience we have ever had! We have stayed in many 5 star hotels including the Ritz Carlton, and the Bloomsbury has been a more enjoyable experience for us. The staff and service from the moment we arrived was exceptional. I would like thank the reception staff and door staff. Suhaina and the team could not have been more welcoming and helpful. We had two 10 year old girls with us and the staff were amazing with them, even giving the girls their own Bloomsbury teddy bears to take home! It was a birthday treat for me and I was made to feel very special. We were given vouchers for free cocktails and sparkling wine to use in any of their bars or the restaurant and macarons and homemade chocolates in our room! We had drinks in the Coral Room bar and ate in the Dalloway Terrace restaurant. Emma was our server and she was great. All the food was amazing. The attention to detail throughout the hotel was very impressive including the gorgeous signature scent candles. Comfort, style, service, cleanliness, food all brilliant. We will definitely stay in the Bloomsbury again and would love to try some of the other hotels from the Doyle Collection.",5,2024,04,04
115,Stay at The Bloomsbury London,"My friends and I stayed in the Bloomsbury last week, most got 2 nights and myself and one other got a third night. From the warm welcome in our arrival until our departure, we experienced warm, professional, excellent service and attention. All the staff deserve mention, but particular praise to the manager and staff in The Coral Room, Brian and Ivan at the concierge desk and Peter who was so helpful arrival and departure. I will certainly stay at The Bloomsbury and have no hesitation in recommending it on the basis of wonderful warm staff and its proximity to tube.",5,2024,04,04
115,We can’t wait to return to this delightful hotel!,"What a delightful hotel!  Comfortable, friendly and very well located. Perfect for a longer stay. 

One of my favorite parts of staying here is the wonderful breakfast but everything was great here.

Book ahead on the hotel’s website to buy a package which includes a substantial and delicious breakfast, including espresso drinks, a buffet with fresh fruit and veg and cooked to order egg dishes and gluten free pancakes. 

The breakfast room is lovely, bright, comfortable and inviting but the friendly and attentive staff really make this experience special: awesome Hostess Maria, Estelita, Hafiz, Yulia  and especially Ms Patricia. 

The beautiful Coral Room is a great place to meet friends for drinks and snacks and we loved sitting for a while in front of the lobby fireplace in the afternoon. 

Finally, thank you to Yao at the front desk, who also took a great photo of us. But to everyone at the front desk, the doormen and the maids also.

We wishes that the library was still public but can imagine that it’s a great meeting room. 

We can’t wait to return.",5,2024,04,03
115,Out of this world.,"What a fantastic place just where we needed to be, it was so central, beautiful comfy bed, very welcoming lovely staff who were always offering their help, an amazing breakfast selection. Thanks for the room upgrade. We will be back for sure.",5,2024,04,02
115,A Definite 5* Property,"The Bloomsbury and the Doyle group were unknown to us before this visit, only choosing it as some friends from USA were staying. We were not disappointed, everything was a full 5* from cleanliness to service to F&B. The staff make this property as so, so friendly and welcoming without being overbearing. The room was immaculately clean too, more than I can say about some other 5* properties we’ve stayed at around the world. We had an upgrade to a beautiful suite when staying but one thing lacking was views, though not every room in London will be able to offer views. I’d certainly forego any view for the overall experience we had on this visit. A big thank you to Bloomsbury and her team.",5,2024,04,01
115,What a woman!,"Nayeema was an absolute delight. She truly went above and beyond to make our anniversary special. Even gave us a little gift in the room when we got back to our room!

What an absolute star of a human! Can’t thank here enough!

100% will be back to visit",5,2024,03,31
115,London Vacation,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is a wonderful experience across the board. The rooms aren't real big but that is the only quasi negative I can come up with. The staff is the best I've ever had. Every single person is treated respectfully and courteously always. I strongly recommend this hotel. It is just a couple blocks from the theater district and less than a block from the tube. Additionally, the food in the restaurants is excellent. The free breakfast is definitely not to be missed. Maria and her crew are the best",5,2024,03,30
115,Wonderful!,"I loved the Bloomsbury! Such a great location and quite the beautiful hotel. The beds were super comfortable and the whole experience felt super luxurious. 

We had some awesome people help us along the way — Mia down in the bar figured out a way to seat 4 of us for drinks on a very busy Friday night. She was super funny and sweet! Also want to mention Cristian and Antonio for help with bags + cars!

Overall would recommend of course, but unfortunately, the actual drinks at the bar were awful. They were doing a special Egyptian theme to the drinks, we all ordered different ones and they were all uniquely bad.",5,2024,03,30
115,The Best Customer Service and Room Service we have ever received whilst staying in London.,"The Bloomsbury is a hidden gem in a fantastic location, just at the top of Tottenham Court Road, easy access to everywhere and great for my regular business trips. 

This hotel is most definitely 5 ***** from arrival to departure we were treated extremely well. The staff remember you by your name and do things the old fashioned way, which is few and far between. 

I have been looking for a more permanent location when visiting and I don’t think I need to look any further. 

Highly recommended 🫶",5,2024,03,28
115,Perfect stay for our 40th Birthday Celebrations,"This was a special stay due to my Husbands 40th Leap Year Birthday celebrations, and a weekend out in London, which all The Bloomsbury team made perfect.

We were welcomed and greeted by the ladies on Reception who were very informative and friendly with us who upgraded our room to a king size free of charge which was very appreciated. 

We went for a drink to the  Coral Room with the drinks vouchers we were given, This room was beautiful and the staff very nice, who also brought us some nibbles. 

Room was lovely, very well equipped,  a very comfortable king size bed and nice to have shower and bath with heated floors. We did have an issue with the carpet in the bedroom where it was very sticky in places, I am surprised the house keeping missed this as it was pretty obvious. We reported it to reception - but given 4 starts because of this. 

The gentlemen outside the hotel were very pleasant in welcoming us and holding an umbrella over us as we came out. The location was fab, a short stroll to the theatre, oxford street and Tottenham Court Road Station. 

We had dinner in the Terrance and the Chicken Milanese was the best I have ever had, again the staff in here were so lovely and welcoming. 

Thanks again to all The Bloomsbury team for such an amazing stay.",4,2024,03,27
115,Great stay in the literary heart of London,"Warm friendly staff and beautiful comfortable bed and room. Quiet but in the heart of the action. 

Ivan and Dale on concierge are so lovely and helpful. They suggested shows, restaurants, nothing was too much trouble. 

Reception staff and door staff were lovely as always. It’s an intimate non stuffy hotel. Rare in London.",5,2024,03,25
115,Amazing hotel in perfect location,"Amazing hotel in perfect location to explore London by foot.  Staff is kind, helpful and professional.  The rooms are impeccably clean and the service staff leave treats and goodies.  Breakfast is a really nice mix of foods and if you like there is a menu to order from.  A great way to begin the day",5,2024,03,24
115,Very pleasant stay,"This is the first visit to this hotel and of the many hotels I have stayed in it’s got the most comfortable bed , room was a touch small but more than ok for a one night stay. Close to the theatres. Bar food was really nice and all staff very good Only issue and it’s small were the shower gel and soaps were so small they ran out when we both showered. Minor things, 
A sign of the times
Well worth a visit, I’d use it again",5,2024,03,23
115,Oasis,"Lovely oasis within the centre of bustling touristy London. V good service, pleasant rooms and good service. Can’t fault. Will stay again when visiting for the theatre and the emirates! The hotel is ideally positioned for theatres and good restaurants.",5,2024,03,23

115,"Charming boutique hotel, great location","Arriving late on Saturday evening, we were greeted very warmly by the night manager, Gregory. Our room was comfortable, nicely furnished, and sparkling - the housekeeping standards here are high. There are two comfortable bars and a delightful restaurant, plus you're in the heart of London - walking distance from the British Museum, Soho, and so much more. Maria presides over the charming breakfast room and Brian, the concierge, is quick to recommend a great restaurant and gives excellent directions. I would happily stay here again.",5,2024,03,13
115,The Bloomsbury Hotel Won’t Disappoint!,"This was the second time we stayed at the Bloomsbury hotel. We had not been there since before. The Covid shut down, so we were truly looking forward to returning. The Bloomsbury did not disappoint! It’s a beautiful hotel with clean, comfortable, well appointed rooms and an outstanding staff!",5,2024,03,12
115,Birthday weekend,"We celebrated a 30th birthday at the Bloomsbury Hotel.  It's in a fantastic location with loads of amenities.  Our room was spot on and we all had a great time.  Special thanks to Sebastian, Carmine, Brian, Antonio and all the Coral room staff. Cheers",5,2024,03,11
115,Weekend away,"Lovely hotel. Friendly staff .rooms luxurious. 
Our room had a shower over the bath, not ideal, as the bathroom was very small.
We tried the breakfast twice, but it was not good . toast was luke warm by the time it got to us .we also tried their eggs benidict they were served on a muffin that should have been toasted, and it wasn't .we didn't bother with breakfast on our last day .

But overall we enjoyed our stay and we would stay here again ",5,2024,03,11
115,Lovely hotel with the most friendly staff,"Lovely hotel with a fantastic breakfast service and a really classy bar! Stylish decor and friendly staff welcomed you anywhere you go.

Maria remembers my name and greet me personally every morning when I was here. They make me feel like home.",5,2024,03,08
115,The best of the Best,"This was our second stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel. It was amazing the first time 13 years ago and even more so this time. The new Elizabeth Line takes you from Heathrow almost to the front door of the Bloomsbury. Very convenient access. We arrived well before check in time, around 10:30am, after an overnight flight to London and were greeted by Sebastian at the front desk. After learning we were there celebrating two special occasions, he made special effort to get us into a room without wait. He even took time to show us around the updates that have been made to the Hotel since our last visit some 13 years ago.

Our room was spectacular as was the breakfast each morning. Our evenings were capped off with a cocktail or two in the Coral Room. Special thanks to Tyree and John at the bar for their conversation and amazing drinks.

Everyone we encountered went out of their way to provide kindness and professionalism. It is no wonder this hotel has so many amazing reviews. It is just about the most perfect hotel we have ever stayed in.",5,2024,03,06
115,A cozy and beautiful hotel with great staff,"I stayed at the Bloomsbury for four nights.  Without hesitation, I would stay at the Bloomsbury again....and hopefully will with my husband the next time London is calling.  

The room was lovely and cozy.  Always clean and I loved the turn down service.  I had booked a cozy room for one - but it could easily have a couple in the room because of the King sized bed.  I might have received a different sized room as my friend booked as I had done but her room was differently configured with a queen sized bed.   Either way, I would have been just as happy in her room.  
The room had both an electric kettle and a Nespresso machine along with the needed supplies.  My room fare included breakfast, which was a great way to start off the day.  They had a cold buffet with lots of choices, but you could also order from a menu if you preferred something hot (if you did, you could still go to buffet).  I was particularly enamored with the Guinness brown bread and the Greek Yogurt with either a slice of honeycomb or the mixed berry preserves. 

 I think that for me what made the experience so special was all of my staff encounters.   EVERYONE of the Bloomsbury Hotel staff was excellent.  All were friendly, engaging, had a ready smile, and were helpful.  It is hard to single out anyone in particular because they were all top notch.  At this caliber of hotel, you would expect this from front facing staff like those in the restaurants, at the door, or reception.   But it is also true of the other staff members such as a mechanic or cleaner that you might run into who was equally as friendly and engaging....always saying hello and inquiring about your stay.  

If you stay here, you must have afternoon tea in the Coral Room and have at least one drink in each of their bars.   You won't be disappointed.  And even if you were not staying here....check those out!

For those new to London...getting here is super easy. The Elizabeth Line from Heathrow will stop at Totten Court Road tube stop which is a block from the hotel.  Very easy and convenient.   Easy walking to the theaters and just a couple of blocks from the British Museum.",5,2024,03,06
115,A brilliant overnight stay in London,"An excellent hotel experience! A warm friendly welcome when we arrived. We were directed to a warm, beautifully furnished room with everything we needed. We were sorry this was just an overnight stay.
Many thanks to Suhaina, Marta and Ivan and all the other staff involved in looking after us so well.",5,2024,03,04
115,Counting down the days until we return,"We've stayed here a few times now and every experience offers something new and different. We found this hotel 2 years ago and we won't stay anywhere else now. It's truly added to a brilliant time in London when we have stayed. 

Nayeema was amazing throughout our stay. We had such a warm greeting from her when we entered. Also a special thanks to Sebastian, who has made special arrangements for us in the past and did so again on this occasion. 
 
We love the Coral Room, it has such a buzz. My husband and I were finally able to part ways with the memory of our favourite cocktail, which sadly left the menu last year. Say hello, brandy crusta!! Wow, a small mix of a cocktail but it packs a punch! The female bartender (wish we knew her name) kindly surprised us with some 'welcome back' sweet treats whilst we sat at the bar. We also had the pleasure of meeting Tyreeq, he has a lovely manner and makes a mean cocktail!

We've stayed in every level of room and they all offer something unique. On this occasion, we stayed in a deluxe king room which was very comfy and cosy. 

Thanks again for making our stay truly special. We can't wait to stay with you again. 

",5,2024,03,04
115,Wonderful experience,This is a beautiful hotel with real class. The service is exceptional and worth the cost for a special stay or a drink in the stunning bar. Our bedroom was plush with a street view.  We were greeted by name and genuine smiles. Nothing is too much trouble.,5,2024,03,04
115,Incredible Hotel - 10/10 would recommend!!,"This is by far one of the best hotels I have stayed at. It is difficult for me to find a hotel that I feel 100% comfortable in, but The Bloomsbury did it for me. The rooms, common areas and bar were absolutely stunning. Not to mention every staff member (especially Marta at reception!) was incredibly kind and helpful. Thank you for making our trip to London so memorable!",5,2024,03,02
115,Very good with amazing staff!,"Very nice hotel and very cute design …. Staff is amazing - especially Gregory at front desk and Maria and Estelita and Yuliia at Breakfast - but everyone is kind and nice and so attentif . Thank you guys! 
My room had a window banging with the wind so last night was a white night for me!",4,2024,02,28
115,Top notch hotel,"An absolutely amazing hotel.  Wonderfully situated just yards from Tottenham Court Road tube station making travelling around London so easy.  Despite its proximity to this busy station, the hotel is very quiet indeed.
We ate out each night, but breakfast is first class in both variety and quality.  The bircher muesli is delicious and full of a wide variety of fruit, as well as a berry compote; there are fruit juices, cold meats and cheese, croissants & pastries, fresh fruit, cereals and plates of smoked salmon with poached eggs or eggs royale, etc.  Not forgetting the classic 'full English'.
The staff are friendly, efficient and helpful.  
Our room was a reasonable size with table & chair, etc., large TV (Chromecast connection) a mini-bar and all other usual facilities; the bathroom with shower has underfloor heating and a night light. Bed was comfortable and warm with good quality pillows and linen.  
What can I say - I loved this hotel and I have stayed in many hotels in London and throughout the UK & Ireland.  It is not cheap but I would stay there again any day.",5,2024,02,27

115,Excellent staff,I visited one weekend in February and was so impressed with the staff. They couldn't do enough for you! Antonio in the door was full off information and even knew the weather status offering me an umbrella while I was exploring! Peter on concierge was so pleasant and helpful in arranging a taxi and helping with luggage at the entrance. Such a lovely comfortable hotel also with a cosy homely lounge area. The only annoyance was a couple in the bar who ruined the mood and atmosphere of the place with excessive PDA but that had nothing to do with the hotel itself.,4,2024,02,26
115,Fantastic stay at The Bloomsbury!,"Fantastic stay at The Bloomsbury. The greatest warm, welcoming and helpful staff! Thank you Peter, Brian, Carmine, Dale, Cristian, Tommy, Suhaina, Nayeema. Who am I missing?! What a great team that work in unison to create such a pleasant experience. Kudos to the leadership team that brought this fantastic crew together. As for the hotel, great location, easy to walk to so many attractions and close to a tube station to easily get around London. Lovely rooms with many amenities, super comfortable beds and turn down service. Two great bars with fantastic bartenders and a really nice restaurant with delicious food. Not sure why the rating is a 4 star because it runs like a 5 star. Thank you Bloomsbury! My only place to stay now when I'm in London.",5,2024,02,25

A shoutout to Ivan, Nayeema, Sebastian, Mihai, Antonio and all the rest who made the stay incredible, greeting me by name every time I returned from an outing.  Great location near theatres, the tube, museums, etc. Comfortable, quiet room.  Cozy restaurants and bars on site.",5,2024,02,24

115,good experience in the bloombury hotel,"we spent a very amazing time with the bloombury hotel.  I will say the reason why you shouldnt miss the hotel in details.

firstly,  its very convienant,  it just take 5-10min to reach the british museum, soho, Chinatown, convent garden from the hotel. And if you go further, you can find train station just near the hotel. (the Elizabeth line also go straight to heathlow airport)

secondly, there are sweetest staffs who provide high quality service.  especially reception service. they provide 24-hour customer service hot line, and concierge team(Dale, Peter, Tony) give us lots of helpful information.
Staffs there also provide small gift and sweet cards to welcome us, everyday we can find lovely chocolate on the desk.  I have to mention that Clara and Nayeema who helped us to do check in,  Emanuel，Suhaina and yijiao yang who done check out for us, gave us useful information for our journey and living environment.  we also received lovely amenity from guest relation team (Marta,Greg and Sebastian ) .

Our suite was spectacular -- what a great bathroom. We were here to celebrate my husband's birthday and the hotel did not disappoint. Loved having evening cocktails in the atmospheric Coral room. After dinner out in Soho, we enjoyed the lower level, cozy speakeasy, which had live jazz the night we were there. The hotel staff are warm, friendly, kind, unpretentious -- and very professional.

From being met as we approached by the Concierge Team, to reception staff and all the rest of the Team, the whole time we were there, we were treated royally. Art Deco style and atmosphere, but very on point, no shappy chic here. The background music in the Coral Room to the live band in the basement, to a quiet lounge area for relaxing, all vibes required are catered for here. We ate in the bar and the restaurant, could not fault either, a fantastic chef! Breakfast had everything too, catered for all tastes, delicious. The rooms were luxurious, extremely clean and had everything you could need or want. Heated floor tiles were a nice touch.

115,Lovely hotel in a great location,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is a delightful, well located hotel with welcoming and friendly staff. I arrived early in the morning and was immensely grateful that my room was ready and that they allowed me ti check in early. 
Whilst the bathrooms were small they were beautifully decorated with premium products. 
The rooms were a fantastic size and nicely decorated. Over the course of my stay lovely treats were left and it is these little touches that really show the Bloomsbury aim to deliver exceptional service. If you are looking for a nice hotel in a fantastic central location I would recommend The Bloomsbury.",5,2024,01,26
115,Amazing Bloomsbury,"Amazing hotel with some of the best staff. The team in the dining area were fantastic, always smiling and happy to help. Thank you so much and can’t wait to visit again. Special thank you to Maria, Estelita, Andrea, Patricia, Gabriela, Mohammed and Yuliya. 🙌🙌😁",5,2024,01,26

Nice room, clean and well appointed. Nice bar and food",5,2024,01,22
115,Delightful stay,"Stayed in the hotel over the weekend 19/01-21/01. The place itself has a nice new-vintage touch. From the floral lobby that reminds you of the 60-70’s wallpaper, to the vibrant coral room bar. Everything complemented by some Lutyens designs, as the lobby’s fire pit and the spider-back or the napoleon chair. The hotel is a nice attraction himself but what really enhances it are its employees. Among the wonderful people we would like to thank Ivan, Antonio, Cristian, Bianca and Sebastian, they made sure we had everything plan ahead and helped us planning to ensure we would have fully enjoyed our time in London.
Can’t recommend enough!",5,2024,01,21
115,Wonderful stay,"We just had a wonderful weekend stay at the Bloomsbury. The front of house team was very friendly and gave us a nice first impression. The room was of a good size and modern with a beautiful bathroom.
The breakfast team was also very welcoming. There was a wide selection of items, hot dishes, and coffees.
The hotel was perfectly located to access our theatre in a short walk. We'll definitely come back!",5,2024,01,21
115,The Best doormen in London,"Unique experience thanks to the location and beauty of the hotel but it has become exceptional thanks to the continuous support of the doormen in particular Antonio, Cristian and Ivan and also thanks to the support at reception of Elvira",5,2024,01,21
115,Bloomsbury stay,"Having stayed at all 3 of Doyle hotels in london I must say the Bloomsbury is my favourite! 
On my recent stay I was not only treated professionally but also treated as an individual quest. 
If you ever need anything during your stay make sure you talk to Ivan the concierge, he is beyond helpful, knowledgeable and will always greet you with a smile! 
I will definitely be staying again without hesitation.",5,2024,01,21
115,Excellent Christmas Holiday Stay,"This was one of the best hotels we've every stayed (compared to the Mandarin Oriental in Bangkok, the Park Hyatt in Tokyo, the Kempinski Palace in Engelberg, the Nam Hai (Four Seasons) in Hoi An), Inn at Little Washington in Virginia, etc!). Not only was every interaction - from reservations to check out - perfect, but staff were at their best during one of the busiest times of the year. 

We had two rooms: a room for my husband and me and a room adjoined for our two teenagers. It was a terrific set up. The hotel is well located and we were able to walk to many of our destinations. And the Coral Room bar was a great place to relax when we returned to the rooms. 

We enjoyed our stay so much that we changed our reservations in Dublin; we moved to another Doyle hotel (Westbury) because our experience was so positive in London. They've got some new fans from Pittsburgh!",5,2024,01,17
115,Wonderful Week Long Stay,"I stayed at the Bloomsbury for a week in December, and it was absolutely wonderful.  The staff was incredibly helpful and responsive to requests, I was upgraded to a spacious room, and the hotel arranged a cab to the airport for me when I left.",5,2024,01,17
115,Both comfortable and convenient,"London has a plethora of small to medium-sized hotels at a range of (mostly high) price points. The Bloomsbury is one of the best in the upper-middle price range. It is a nice building, well-managed, with good amenities, in a great part of London. It has a good bar, live jazz on certain nights, and a nice restaurant for breakfast. It's quiet for sleeping yet close to places one wants to go. I happened across it by accident and now choose it when I can. This time it was just for a short stopover between business engagements elsewhere. I was completely happy with it.",5,2024,01,16
115,A perfect hotel!,"This was our first stay at the Bloomsbury and will certainly not be our last .
On a previous trip to London we ate in the Galloway Terrace restaurant and had drinks in the Coral Bar . Amazing ! 
The bar is one of the most stunning in London ! 
The Galloway restaurant’s decor is a unique garden experience!
Hotel staff were on all levels were superb . So very helpful with directions, suggestions as to restaurants, shopping or anything we could ask of them .
Room was lovely. Bathroom was a tad small for 2 people but beautifully appointed . 
www will definitely be back !",5,2024,01,16
115,"Great staff, always there if you need.","We were happily surprised to discovered the bloomsbury hotel while browsing around Central London. 
The doorman Miai watched our attention outside and directed us in the hotel when we asked for somewhere to drink.
At the door we've met Antonio who promptly introduced us the way to the bar. 
Then we were introduced to the receptionist (sorry I can't remember her name) who accommodated us on a high table at the bar where we could appreciate the entire decor.
We will be back before departing.",5,2024,01,15
115,A Beautiful Stay,"I stayed at The Bloomsbury for 2 nights in early January. It was truly magical. The food is amazing - and the pre-theatre set menu in The Dalloway Terrace is especially good value. Special mention must also go to the Guinness bread - genuinely out of this world! 

I’d like to say a special thank you to Suhjana, Nayeema, Clara and Sebastian on reception - as well as Tony the Doorman and Estilita at Breakfast. Every employee was so lovely, so very warm and welcoming, but these people especially stood out to me.

Thank you for the most special stay. I would 1000% recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a thoughtful stay.",5,2024,01,15
115,Warm and welcoming hotel with amazing staff!,"The hotel is lovely and the staff are incredibly kind. There are many wonderful people at this property, but standouts are especially Estelita and Maria-Patricia who serve guests in the breakfast room — they could not be more caring and sweet in how they run the restaurant. Can’t wait to come back!",5,2024,01,14
115,Highly recommend,"I highly recommend the staff were very friendly and overall i had a very pleasant experience, the rooms were kept very tidy and the breakfast was delicious.

115,Amazing ☺️,"Went in the Coral room for drinks with friends on January 8th. The place is wonderful and very welcoming. The staff is super nice and cocktails are amazing. A special thanks to Anastasia who sitted us without a reservation and to Antonio who's been super friendly in welcoming us and introduce us to their team. We will definitely come back for more.

Downside: some staff was too loud and the disable toilette's handle was broken. So one star less for improvement.",5,2024,01,09
115,Amazing ,"Just back from a break in the  Bloomsbury in London and it was amazing .From the moment we checked in Ricardo made us feel welcome and relaxed.The location is fantastic, consierge was so helpful , lots of advise on tubes and where to go and how to get around London.All the staff we had the pleasure in interacting with were so kind and made us feel so welcome .The Coral bar is super, so relaxing after a day of sightseeing ,again thanks to all the staff who are very knowledgeable 😀.

115,An outstanding and memorable stay,"The warmest of welcomes every time we stay here - and the cosiest comfiest beds, a stylish and immaculately clean design-led interior, the kindest and most engaging staff, and a really good food and drink menu too. Oh, I should mention the breakfast too - not just for the food but the personal welcome given by the ladies who seem to remember every guest by name even from years ago!",5,2024,01,07
115,IF ONLY...,5 STAR if the rooms were more soundproof. Unfortunately I could hear other quests quite easily from my room. Walls too thin. Nespresso machine very noisy but nice to have one and a teapot too. Such nice people and professional staff and a  beautiful place!! I loved London. Too bad I could hear too much.,5,2024,01,05
115,"Ticked all of the boxes, lovely stay","Stayed 3 nights with my husband and loved it.

Main things: staff were lovely, check-in was nice and easy (and our room was even available at 9am when we arrived off a long flight - bonus!), location was fab, and room was modern and comfortable. The room was a bit on the small size, but for the price paid and the central location it was absolutely fine.

Small things: lounge with mulled wine was lovely! The rooms not only had complimentary coffee machines but also biscuits and hot choclate (which you never seem to get these days!). Bath room had a night light so I didn't have to blind myself going to the toilet in the middle of the night, and towels were big and fluffy.

Overall, really liked this place, and will probably stay again next time we're in London.",5,2024,01,03
115,10/10 would recommend!,"Amazing Hotel, would definitely recommend! They have a great interior, welcoming and polite staff and great, clean rooms. Would stay there again! Also the Terrace for the afternoon tea is absolutely delightful and the Bar cozy with a great choice for drinks.",5,2024,01,03
115,Nye in The Bloomsbury,"Overall, we had a very good experience with the hotel. The location is good as is the accessibility by public transport. The rooms were not too small as this can sometimes be the case in London. The staff at reception and at the front door were extremely friendly and helpful. The only criticism is that the staff in the hotel bar were not always friendly. Waiting times there sometimes ran to more than 20 minutes without being very busy. Paying 15% service charge on top of the bill after such a service cannot be done in such a hotel. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely come back here. 

",4,2024,01,03
115,Long flight from Australia fabulous stay in London.,"Second time staying at the Bloomsbury in London. Great hotel perfect location to walk London also a few minutes walk to the underground.

Will definitely stay at the Bloomsbury again next time we are in London.",5,2024,01,02

The Bloomsbury bar is quite nice as well, I really like the theme of the bar, really special.",5,2024,01,02
115,Wonderful stay ,Back in London and back at the Bloomsbury hotel with our friends to celebrate New Year’s Eve in style at the  Coral room with their amazing show what a fantastic evening we had with great music and great atmosphere. Davide and Maria at breakfast the next morning made our stay special. We will return soon. ,5,2024,01,01
115,"Good, not great","Stayed 6 nights over Christmas time and had an okay experience.  The pros:  the lobby's parlor room is very charming.  Proximity to the Elizabeth line and the tube.  2 bottles each of still and sparkling water are provided for each guest/night (for the most part...we had a night where sparkling was not replenished).  Staff was kind enough when we had a question or request.  (Not much interaction beyond that, which may partly be a function of lobby layout.  The front desk staff is in a small alcove/room so you may not encounter them unless you step into that area.)  The bed linens were very warm and foot slippers were provided.  

The neutral:  Room size about what you'd expect for Europe (ie, small from an American pov).  Room service was okay.  Would have been nice if the food was hotter.  
I visited the Coral Room and was underwhelmed.  Thought I'd stay for a second drink, switching from cocktail to wine, but the wine list was rather limited.  

The cons:  I booked this hotel in large part because they advertise heated bathroom floors.  Ours didn't seem to work.  We called twice, were told two different things about how/why and never got them to work.  (And no one followed up on the point, to ensure we were comfortable.)  In our room, the windows were in need of serious updating.  It was very loud and drafty when the wind blew.  Our final night was a particularly windy one and I took audio of how the windows rattled all night long.  I did not get a wink of sleep.  We had hoped to use the gym, but it's one VERY cramped room and not an environment where I'd want to work out with another guest.  (And when I visited, another guest was indeed using it.)  On our final night we got a note that the gym would be closed for updates, but unless they are expanding the foot print, I'm dubious that the gym will be great for fitness enthusiasts.  If you have accessibility concerns, I'd recommend calling to discuss as it wasn't clear that the hotel entrance is accessible for someone using a wheelchair, scooter, etc.  I have to think there is an alternative entrance or something.",3,2024,01,01
115,No better place to stay in London! ,"Stay Nov 29-Dec 2 (due to cancellations of flight due to weather condition until Dec 4)

From the first minute we stepped into the Bloomsbury it felt like coming home. Not just because of the coziness of the sitting room with the fireplace but first and foremost because of the warm welcome from all staff. 

Beginning with Clara at the front desk who managed our stay so smoothly especially after we had to unexpectedly extend our stay due to weather conditions at home. 

In the Bloomsbury Club Bar we relaxed at the first night with wonderful drinks and the best service from Anoushka. 

Estelita, Maria, Andrea, Mohammed and Gabriele made every morning an enjoyable one, taking care of us with their attentive breakfast service. 

We also want to highlight the fantastic staff in the Coral room: 
Hannah, Jasmine, Shukran and Georgi who attended to us in such a lovely manner and taking their time to find the best drinks for our individual tastes. And Marie for making them behind the bar. 

Besides the people we got to meet personally we want to extend our gratitude and thanks to all the staff that cared for our rooms and cleanliness, thank you!

It will not be our last time at the Bloomsbury and we couldn‘t have chosen a better place to be stranded and feel so at home. ",5,2023,12,30
115,Lovely ,"The hotel location is great. As soon as I walked to the hotel I had this amazing feeling, made me feel so welcomed. As soon as I reached the first step of the hotel my luggage was taken by the porter. The reception stuff is so nice the girl was new but so helpful explain everything to me and make sure everything was fine. My laggage was taken to the room by Antonio the porter. He was amazing super friendly and I was curious about some things in the area because it's my first time in London. He explained to me, gave me tips. Thank you Antonio. You are awesome. I'm happy they hire you. Your costumer service skills at 11/10.  I'm definitely coming back to this place. The rooms are  very comfortable and clean. Please continue to do such an amazing job.

115,Truly Made to Feel Special!,"My wife and I were blown away by this hotel and its amazing team as soon as we walked through the door. 

Peter on the door was super friendly and always helpful. 

Sebastian at check in was also fantastic and gave us the warmest welcome. 

We were only staying one night but we managed to try most bars. We are at The Coral Room for lunch and drinks in the evening. It has a fantastic feel to it and it didn't get too busy either. The steak sandwich was a perfect way to start our stay. 

The room was very large by London standards. Super clean and every single element had been thought about. Huge bathroom too!

Breakfast was also great. A la carte and buffet but I opted for the usual eggs Benedict. The team down there was super friendly. Naming us by name and checking on us often enough. 

The team are what made this experience special for us. Cannot fault them. 

We'll be back!

I find this to be a great location (especially if you plan on seeing a lot of theatre). A little loud between hallway/outside noise, so my suggestion is to bring a sound machine!",5,2023,12,15
115,A hidden treasure in Theatreland ,"Wonderful staff from the porter to the restraurant manager. Nothing is too much trouble and they work  well together as team. This always means a hotel is well managed because a hotel depends on its staff ans this team is happy.   The room we had (210) was very comfortable with every posssible thing to make our stay pleasant. 
This was my first experience of a Doyle hotel and the Irish touch was evident evrywhere including the amanzing Clonakilty black pudding I had for breakfast. Better than a Bury Black pudding!!
We will return! ",5,2023,12,12
115,London stay at its best!,"Stay Nov 29-Dec 2 (due to cancellations of flight due to weather condition until Dec 4)

Our experience was absolute smashing (from welcome to farewell). Among all the attentive and courteous people, we like to highlight:

Clara at the reception who handled everything in a smooth and professional yet warm manner - especially, as we had to stay longer due to weather conditions at home preventing us to return as planned; great job!

Mohammed, Maria, Andrea, and Gabriele who made every breakfast a highlight of the day!

Coral Room: Hannah, Jamine, and Georgi who was attending to us in an unprecedented lovely way - thanks to you for your recommendations on the various Cocktails (Finnegan was my favorite)

Bloomsbury Club Bar: Anoushka who made the first evening upon our arrival a most relaxing one!

The rooms were very comfortable with everything you would need, the staff was very knowledgable and helpful, and the food delicious, although we only ate the breakfast and once in the Coral Room.

The staff in the restaurant were as friendly and accommodating as the rest of the team, ensuring that every meal was a memorable experience.

We were the welcomed further the staff at reception particularly Sebastian. Maria  at the breakfast service was so warm and friendly & went out of her way to make us & particularly our son, comfortable & welcome. We had spectacular meal in The Dalloway Terrace and Helena (or maybe Elena?) was an absolute star. She was so attentive & friendly. I have never had such excellent service.

The entire staff was great, the maitre d staff was always checking on things and welcoming whenever we walked in - apologies I don't recall their names (maybe John and David?). Staff in Dalloway Terrace restaurant was fantastic (Elena in particular), we chose to have dinner there multiple times rather than going out. Cleaning staff was on top of things always checking up and making sure things were good.",5,2023,11,07

The room was lovely, extremely comfortable bed and spacious. It was my wife’s birthday and it was very thoughtful of the hotel to leave a little box of macrons along with a little note and a plate with birthday wishes in chocolate. It was really appreciated.

The breakfast was excellent and great selection.

A lovely hotel and one I would strongly recommend , especially for a special celebration. We stayed for 2 nights which was perfect. Also a great location, Covent Garden is about 12-15 mins walk away, if you want shopping, Oxford Street is only 5 mins away.",5,2023,11,06
115,Superb stay at the Bloomsbury,"What a fantastic stay at the Bloomsbury this weekend. Girls weekend with friends and couldn’t have felt more special. We were greeted at reception by Nayeema who was simply wonderful. She went above and beyond to make our welcome brilliant and put a smile on our faces immediately. What a lovely lady and total credit to the hotel. The gentlemen at the door were amazing, friendly, nothing was too much and we always had a good morning, evening and the door opened for us. Our room was fab. Absolutely everything we needs and more. Comfortable, spotlessly clean, lots of lovely products, fresh water, robes and slippers. I can’t say enough about the housekeepers, the unsung hero’s who not only looked after our room but knocked on our door everyday to see if we needed anything. The coral bar was great. Best cocktails and lovely service, again faultless. The Bloomsbury club bar was a hidden gem, great atmosphere and live music, and afternoon tea in the Dalloway terrace was very special. Location is fab, we always stay in the area and love it, and have stayed in lots of hotels, the Bloomsbury is worth the little extra money and the best. My summary of our weekend was, exceptional. The staff make the hotel, you certainly have a brilliant recruitment process and have chosen very well, they are all a credit to you and made our stay. Again shout out to Nayeema who was so lovely and set our weekend up for us. The lovely gents at the door walked us to our car and carried our bags for us, above and beyond. We could have spent the whole weekend in the hotel without the need to go out quite happily. We will stay longer next time and I couldn’t recommend this Hotel more. Well done Bloomsbury. ",5,2023,11,05
115,Business visit can be wonderful too in other ways,Location is fantastic - 3min to subway and everywhere is walkable distance. Dinner at the terrace is atmospheric and well heated. The menu is fine but the green curry can be improved. Breakfast room service is outstanding particularly with the attentive service of Marya and Mohamad. Bellman Christian was most helpful in giving directions and dining suggestions. All told a memorable experience.,5,2023,10,29
115,Went the extra mile to make it a lovely stay,"The hotel is always very smart, he rooms are very clean comfortable and smart.

The Manager went out of her way to find some theatre tickets for some light relief between work - knowing the shows that were on and able to guide me to a good choice, plus the BCB for some live music after

The staff are all friendly giving a homely feel to the place.",5,2023,10,28
115,Most enjoyable stay and can't wait to come back.,"My partner and I were traveling with Goodspeed Musicals London Tour with 48 individuals. We had a wonderful room and a Full English Breakfast each morning overseen by the gracious and wonderful Maria who recognized us even after 3 years. She was ably assisted by Estella, Andrea, Patricia, Gabriela and Debora. Her welcoming presence and ready smile made us both feel as through we were the most important guests to be taken care of that morning. The staff were all incredible. The Breakfast selections are the best we have ever had. The same was true for all of our tour members. She knew who usually sat with whom; what our beverage preferences were, whether we would order off the menu or have the buffet, and all our names!!! To experience such welcoming at the beginning of each day was the best! We look forward to seeing her next year.
The other great place was the Coral Room where our group always gathered after our evening show or event. George was the server who took care of us each night and our group was about 30. He was efficient, effective and personable. Can't wait to get back to see him next year.
We also loved talking to the hotel manager at length about our stay. She wanted to hear any suggestions about the accommodations and services and is committed to providing a great experience for all guests.",5,2023,10,27
115,Stunning Stay,"What a beautiful hotel. Everything was perfect from the time we arrived until we departure.
The check-in was flawless from Sebastian, the room was spotless. The bar is amazing with lovely cocktails. The breakfast was superb, food delicious as well as very friendly service from Maria and get team
Special thank you to Marta for running this special hotel, feels like it’s got even better over the past few years 
Thank you",5,2023,10,27
115,A Delightful Hotel!,"The accommodations were delightful, our room was meticulously maintained on a daily basis.  All the staff were welcoming and friendly.  We particularly enjoyed Maria in the breakfast room.  Her cheerful greeting and recall of my name from day 1 was amazing.",5,2023,10,26
115,Stay at the Bloomsbury ,"I had a great experience during my stay at the Bloomsbury. All of the staff are so attentive and helpful and I enjoyed my time there immensely because of this. I would like to thank Nayeema and Emanuel at the reception for their help with everything, they were great and so kind. ",5,2023,10,26
115,The Bloomsbury never disappoints,"Booking at the Bloomsbury is effortless when you have Emanuel, Marta and Ricardo taking care of everything. It was a wonderful surprise to discover that we had been upgraded. In fact we would have stayed in that lovely room all evening if it had not been for the food and service in the Dalloway restaurant. Top marks to Nayeema on reception! We’ll be back.",5,2023,10,26
115,Luxurious hotel with great room rates perfectly placed for the West End of London.,"The Bloomsbury was buzzing with enthusiastic guests from many nations. 
We particularly enjoyed breakfast under the watchful eyes of Maria the manager who seems to remember all of the guests names-very impressive. Special mention for great service from Andrea and Gabriela. 
The Duty Managers Sebastian and Sidney ensured that all of our requests were taken care of instantly and effectively. 
We love The Bloomsbury hotel. It is definitely a 5 Star experience at great room rates. For the location and value nothing can touch it. We recommend room 312. Luxurious and indulgent. 
The Coral Room continues to be a fantastic cocktail bar presided over by Georgi. 
One small criticism is the loudness of the background music. We all had difficulty hearing each other both in the daytime and evening.
We will be back for Christmas. Can’t wait!",5,2023,10,24
115,A super hotel with exceptional staff!,As always a fantastic experience at this wonderful gem in Bloomsbury. Staff are exceptional and rooms delightful (we did get upgraded) but have stayed before and are always impressed.  Would not stay anywhere else in London.,5,2023,10,23
115,Perfect 1st visit to London thanks to the staff,"We had the most amazing stay at The Bloomsbury in September. We stayed for 9 days in a classic room. Location was spot on, 3 minute walk to Tottenham Court Rd tube station, buses close by and easy walk to some major attractions. The location was very quiet, no outside noise could be heard in our room. Lovely welcome note and gift in our room on arrival. Bathroom was spacious and the room was cleaned very well everyday. We loved the lobby lounge, coral room and we had a perfect dinner in the Dalloway Terrace for my 50th, special thanks to our waitress for the champagne and dessert. That’s what makes this hotel exceptional. The staff!! The staff throughout the whole hotel were amazing. From the doormen out front to the bar staff and everyone in between. Nayeema, Yijao, Marta and Sebastian at the front desk. Big thanks for helping to organise my birthday cake surprise with my husband. Special thanks goes to the lovely beautiful staff in the breakfast room, Patricia, Gabriela, Estelita, Andreea and a few gentlemen that I can’t remember their names, so sorry. Sweetest most attentive staff. Probably the best breakfasts we have had in any hotel. Have the eggs benedict and the pancakes!! Thanks so much for singing happy birthday, it was a lovely way to start my 50th birthday :) Highly recommend The Bloomsbury and would not hesitate to stay again when in London.",5,2023,10,22
115,The Bloomsbury- Great visit,We have travelled to London over the years and  like to stay in the Russell Square area.  After looking at other options I called the hotel directly and made reservations for 5 nights for the first week of  October.  Couldn't have been more pleased.  The staff was one of the friendliess of any hotel we have ever stayed.  Enjoyed the breakfast.    The concierge staff was extremely helpful in arranging theater tickets and transportation.   Very convenient to the tube and busses.  The only minor complaint was that one of the elevators was out of service.  Looking forward to staying at the Bloomsbury on our next trip.  ,5,2023,10,20
115,Another great stay at the Bloomsbury,"Another great stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel. Their breakfast team is the best, not only great food but a fantastic warm and friendly crew. Many thanks to Maria, Estelita, Andrea, Mohammad and Patricia for their great customer service!",4,2023,10,20
115,The Bloomsbury - the perfect London Hotel,"This lovely hotel is very close to the Elizabeth line from Heathrow.  If you want a clean, well-appointed room that is within walking distance or tube distance from all of the major attractions, you cannot go wrong with The Bloomsbury.  We spent 8 nights and enjoyed every one.  Additionally, you are only two stops from Paddington on the Elizabeth line for ease of travel to Windsor, Bath, Oxford and more.",5,2023,10,13
115,Bloomsbury Revisited,"I spent my birthday at the Bloomsbury Hotel and what a treat! As always the staff were superb and made me feel so special. Maria and her team at breakfast sang happy birthday and presented me with a celebratory sorbet and candle. New additions to the team were also fantastic, Emma and Courtenay in the Dalloway restaurant were so friendly and smiley.

The food was excellent, perfectly catering for my dietary requirements. I stayed at another luxury hotel in the Cotswolds last week, which was more expensive and their breakfast wasn’t a patch on the Bloomsbury’s. With fresh fruit compotes, homemade granola, speciality breads, including a delicious Guinness bread highlights of the buffet and a hot menu cooked to order - the Bloomsbury shows other hotels how it should be done.

I love the little touches - the Picasso design cushions on the bed, the carefully curated Bloomsbury themed books on the bedside table. As a writer who has just written about Virginia Woolf and her mother, I couldn’t have felt more at home!",5,2023,10,12
115,Superb ,"I stayed here on vacation and was very happy with the quality and size of the room. It was a great location, very close to the tube and walking distance to lots of restaurants. If you're going to the British museum, this hotel is in the perfect location. Of special note, Mohamed the night porter is an absolute gem. He went above and beyond to provide my boyfriend and I exceptional service, which I am incredibly thankful for. It’s safe to say I found my new favourite London Hotel.

5 Stars is an understatement.",5,2023,10,05
115,"Beds are super comfortable, room was quiet - we could actually sleep!","They have updated the hotel since we were here last; everything is clean and lovely.  Staff is very helpful.  The breakfast had a lot of buffet choices, so we didn't bother with ordering off the menu.  Only complaint is that they only have two elevators, one was out of order for quite a while, and one night *both* were not operating.  Long trudge to our room...",5,2023,10,03
115,A Gem in a great location! ,"After a difficult travel day of cancelled flights arriving at the Bloomsbury was a breath of fresh air. We weren't supposed to arrive until Monday but after having to change our travel plans due to flight cancellations, we arrived in London two days early. The Bloomsbury could not have been more accommodating.  Gregory at the front desk added on two nights at the same rate as our original booking. He even gave us complimentary drink tickets on arrival because of our flight troubles (which of course had nothing to do with the Bloomsbury).

The hotel is beautiful from the terrace to the Coral Bar to the hotel rooms. We were in a cozy, well appointed room. The bed was comfortable, the room and bathroom were spotlessly clean.  The turndown service was a nice touch as well.  

The concierge Dale gave great recommendations for dinner and activities. The location of the hotel is a short walk from a central Tube station. We could easily walk to or take a quick subway ride to all of the London attractions.

Do not miss the breakfast! For one all inclusive price you have access to menu items such as a full English breakfast as well as an impressive buffet spread. The food is fresh and delicious. You won't find a better breakfast at any of the London restaurants.  

I can't say enough good things about the hotel and their staff.  We will definitely stay there again on our next London trip!",5,2023,10,02
115,How is this not 5 stars!!!!,"Everything about this hotel gives 5 star!!! So confused as to where the 4 star rating came from. The bars were exquisite, rooms were super comfy, breakfast was incredible. However what topped off the stay was the staff. Greg the night receptionist catered our every need with efficiency, Norbert always greeted us with a beautiful smile which made us feel at home. But i have to say the star of the trip was Mohamed (Night Concierge) he really stood out i have to say! Always greeted us by our names, gave us exceptional recommendations of where to go in the Covent garden area, always had a smile on his face, and helped with our safe transport back to the airport. 

Definitely returning.",5,2023,10,01
115,Wonderful hotel in the best location for a walking tour of London,"My wife and I just returned from a 4 night stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel in London, and we still wish we were being greeted by their perpetually friendly and helpful staff as we entered and left each day. The hotel is a gem in a terrific location for walking (or Tubing) to many of London's most appealing neighborhoods and sites. We loved the cozy sitting room across from reception, enjoyed incredible breakfasts pampered by staff who couldn't be more attentive, and best of all two of the best bar experiences we had in all of London. The Coral Room is what your dream of a high-end English cocktail bar would be--beautifully lit and appointed, lively yet gracious. Our bartender David took us through every drink in the month's featured series, and the selections were so delicious it required real will power to stop at 2. The Bloomsbury Club is more, well, ""clubby"" but still very elegant and features outstanding live music on the weekend. Our room was modest in size, but comfortable, quiet, very clean and well-appointed, a perfect respite after days of walking, eating, drinking and exploring. The staff were all exceptionally helpful and kind, special thanks to Ricardo Estevez, Carmine, Antonio and Suhania who were attentive to every need. Highly recommended, we would stay there again and again.",5,2023,10,01
115,It was OK.,"The location is close to a very useful Tube stop, which is exceedingly helpful because you can easily connect to just about anywhere.  The area around the hotel, however, is a bit dirty - which maybe is what is to be expected from Soho.  We did not eat at the hotel, but the terrace restaurant is lovely and it was often filled.  I recommend Ole & Steen (around the corner) for good breakfast take away.  The rooms are small (to be expected) - very small for 2 people. Housekeeping is excellent (do NOT forget to tip them!).  There are 2 bars on premises.  The ground floor bar has very poor and sometimes rude service.  There is a speakeasy on -1 and it has great service, so that's preferable.  If you're looking for max quiet, I would suggest 612-614 (or other floors ending in 12 & 14).  The towels are quite fluffy.  
",3,2023,10,01
115,Breakfast ,"The daily breakfast was outstanding.   Ordering off the menu, just scrumptious, as well as the  delicious buffet.
Our experience with Maria, Esfulita, Andrea and Yulila was the best.  The afternoon tea did not disappoint. 
Our overall stay was more than we expected.  

Can't wait to come back!",5,2023,09,29
115,Beautiful hotel in the heart of SOHO/Westend yet perfectly tucked away.,"I cannot rave about this hotel enough! From our warm welcome from Ricardo to the very helpful concierge, Dale and everything in between, we had a 5 star stay!

The Bloomsbury is in a perfect location nestled between Soho and The Westend. EVERYTHING is a few steps away including a tube station and the new Elizabeth Line for easy, fast, nonstop access to Heathrow. 

I use the word nestled because you feel like you’re sleeping in a sensory deprivation tank. The rooms are very large, extremely well appointed and extraordinarily comfortable. 

Service in every department was exceptional. The daily breakfast was abundant, delicious and I can imagine accommodated every culture. 

Do not hesitate to stay at The Bloomsbury, splurge on a suite. We had 514 and it was pure PERFECTION!

Enjoy xx",5,2023,09,25
115,Always an Excellent Experience!,"Everything about this Hotel will make you want to return.  From the moment of registration with Nayeema and Suhaina who remember your name and make sure that everything is perfect, to Maria in the breakfast room who greets you with total enthusiasm, to the concierges who ensure that your transfer to the next leg of your trip goes smoothly.",5,2023,09,15
115,7 Stars experience!,"I just spent the best four nights at The Bloomsbury hotel. I booked this hotel after reading the reviews and talking to friends who have stayed there and I had high expectations. THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT. From the moment we checked-in Suaina and Clara made us feel at home and gave me and my friend a tour of the hotel and even provided us with an unexpected cocktail voucher as I mentioned it was my friend birthday celebration. Throughout the stay we met the wonderful and professional Ivan, who helped us get around the city and suggested the best spots for dinner. On our return the Night Manager Gregory welcome us with a warm and friendly smile, always eager to help and when we called down in reception during the night because we couldn't figure out how to switch off the TV, Norbert came right away and solved the issue promptly and wished us a pleasant night. Extremely professional and friendly too.  We also went to Dalloway terrace, the food was delicious and we were served by the lovely Madalina, who made the experience even more magical. The last day of our trip arrived (sadly) and we went to check-out. There we were greeted by Sebastian and Nayeema who helped us store the bags and asked us about our trip. We were amazed by each team member service. It was outstanding. Lastly, thank you to Marta, who helped us organize the booking and the special treats for my friend's birthday and even upgraded our room, she made sure our stay was perfect. We will definitely be coming back and tell each of the people we know to stay at the Bloomsbury. It is an experience everyone should be able to try. We loved the hotel decor, but the staff is what makes this place magical. If I could give more stars I would.",5,2023,09,14
115,Five Stars Plus!!!,The Bloomsbury is wonderful! Staff supportive and friendly. Room super comfortable and cozy.  Love the building architecture  and the fact it is perfectly maintained! My wallet with all forms of payment was stolen during last days of trip. Don't know what I would have done without the support of Dale (Concierge ) and Sidney (Guest Relations Manager). With their help it was easy to make my way comfortably back home. Staying at the Bloomsbury was the highlight of my London vacation!,5,2023,09,14
115,We loved it!!,"I can’t say enough wonderful things about our stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel!!  The staff made everything perfect and were all so kind- especially Ivan and Sebastian.  The rooms were beautiful and it was just the best home base to come and go from while exploring London.  From live music to afternoon tea- each experience was so lovely!  Thank you, thank you, thank you for making our first trip to London so special!  We will be back!!",5,2023,09,12
115,Great experience.,"The Hotel was beautiful and very clean. The room was very comfortable. The staff was very attentive and friendly from the front desk, concierge, bartenders, waiters, room service staff and especially our breakfast staff Maria, Estelita, Alex T., Mohamed, Laszlo and Gabrile. Delicious breakfast.
Thank you for a wonderful 5 nite stay. ",5,2023,09,12
115,Beautiful hotel,"The attention to detail in this hotel is what makes it stand out. The decor, the food, every part has just had that extra bit of style and luxury. The staff are superb, all go above and beyond to make all guests feel special. 
Breakfast is so good, with a menu to order from AND a buffet. 
Simply wonderful.",5,2023,09,11
115,Perfect Hotel with Lovely Staff,"For our trip to London from the US, we agonized over our hotel choices, weighing our decision between many fantastic hotels in great city locations, until we narrowed it down to this one. And we were so very thrilled that we ended up choosing The Bloomsbury. First of all, the location was perfect for us. We were steps from the tube station and busses. The main hub of Soho is a few blocks away and we spent a few evenings there. The common areas of the hotel are posh, and the staff is all amazing. We encountered a problem with our room that was out of the control of the staff, and they insisted on moving us to another room immediately. Instead of giving us a room in the same class we had booked, they put us in a beautiful suite, with a sitting area, a marble bathroom, and a free standing tub under the window. Every staff member was pleasant every time we saw them. We had drinks in the Coral Room and Afternoon Tea at the restaurant. It was a wonderful experience that I hope to repeat the next time we travel to London. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,09,11
115,A Dream Hotel!!!,"The Bloomsbury exceeded every expectation we had! We had dreamed about staying at this hotel for a long time and we will certainly be back! The hotel was exquisite and the staff was incredible! A special shout-out to the Coral Room bartenders, Alex and Mary, who were phenomenal and made our visit even more special! ",5,2023,09,08
115,Best Gem in London,"It was truly an experience from The Coral room DJ and libations, the BC club live jazz, the Dalloway tea, to our nicely appointed room. The staff are superb, excellent, skilled, kind, inviting, caring and joyous! We have considered opening a club in Nashville and we would send our staff to The Bloomsbury for training because the best way to serve is to know what it's like to be served. Well Done YOU!",5,2023,09,07
115,"Faultless service, top quality hotel, unrivalled location and wonderful ambiance.  ","We had the pleasure to stay at the Bloomsbury last weekend for my wife's 60th birthday and from the moment we stepped in to the moment we checked out the service was outstanding. It is rare to come across any establishment which maintains such excellent standards, the reception staff were friendly yet efficient and very helpful, but the same can be said about all the hotel staff. 

There is lovely relaxed ambiance about this hotel and for location just 50 metres from Oxford Street and 5 minutes from theatreland is hard to find a more convenient place to stay. In the evening there was the added bonus of a 3 piece jazz band who were brilliant. To top everything we even received a free upgrade on account of my wife's birthday and were made to feel very special and whenever we go to London again we have already decided to not waste our time looking around for hotels, it will be the Bloomsbury again and again. Highly recommended and I would like to thank the management for the faultless service we received. ",5,2023,09,01
115,"Excellent Hotel, Excellent Stay & Excellent Staff","Our stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel was for a special London trip, we got Engaged at the hotel. The hotel staff arranged an excellent display in the room for the proposal, and went above and beyond to ensure our special day, and stay was as excellent as it could be.

The hotel is brilliantly located inside Bloomsbury, hidden off the main road, absolutely hidden from the sounds of London once inside.

Confused why this hotel has an official 4* rating, because the experience inside is as 5* as it gets and does not disappoint! We will be returning to The Bloomsbury Hotel for our future anniversaries and London trips!",5,2023,09,01
115,A special stay,"My husband and I were introduced to the Bloomsbury hotel last year and we have not stayed anywhere else since. 

We have stayed a few times now and the most recent stay was to celebrate my birthday. Everything that my husband ordered as a paid add-on was executed perfectly. 

My husband booked a luxury suite. The suite is beautiful and incredibly spacious, including the bathroom, which has 'his and her' sinks and a rolltop bath. It has all the amenities you could ask for. 

We loved the turndown service. We were greeted with beautifully arranged rose petals, slippers and chocolate placed by our bedsides. 

Throughout our stay, Sebastian and Aurora coordinated everything perfectly and made our experience very special. 

A special thanks to the bartender who made our favourite cocktail, which has sadly left the menu. He took the time to recreate it and it was perfect! 

We look forward to staying again.

Recommendation for potential guests - book a table in the Bloomsbury Club and enjoy some live jazz. Guido Spanocchi and his band are brilliant. 

Also, we have stayed in a variety of rooms from classic to suite, we have had a brilliant experience every single time. ",5,2023,08,30
115,A great find in the middle of London,"What a great place to stay right bang slap in the middle of London. 
We booked a basic room on the seventh floor and we’re really pleased with it….ample space, nicely decorated with everything you need. Husband and I had a marmite experience with the peppermint shampoo that I loved!
This is a great hotel that I think is reasonably priced for central London. Decor is fun and arty, rooms quiet and the staff are all absolutely brilliant. We are going to come use this hotel again for sure!! They also have a restaurant called the dalloway which was great.",5,2023,08,30
115,Stunning London Boutique Hotel,"The Bloomsbury is a beautiful boutique hotel in the heart of London that is exceptionally well located with personal touches throughout. The staff are wonderful and attentive, the rooms have a unique design bringing together modern, international touches, with distinctly British vibes. The location is fabulous and the hotel has multiple choices for drinks and a lovely location for meals. This can be a romantic getaway, or an excellent location for business travels as well. We are most grateful to the staff and doormen we encountered during our stay which were wonderful. We are booking our next stay for September with them again and look forward to making this our base in London.",5,2023,08,27

115,Great Hotel!,"What an amazing hotel!  The service was fantastic, the staff was friendly and helpful.  The room was large and comfortable, with a huge bathroom.  Be sure to add breakfast, as the spread was wonderful, lots of breads, fruit, yogurt-all the things you'd expect from a five-star hotel.  Very convenient to the underground, and a short walk away from the British Museum.  If we ever get to go back to London, we'll surely stay here! ",5,2023,08,22
115,We will be back!,"Wonderful hotel, made to feel very welcome by a fabulous reception team. Celebrating our 45th wedding Anniversary and was made extra special by a free upgrade to a king room, sparkling wine and delicious macaroons delivered to our toom. Especially liked when we went to their Dalloway Terrace for dinner that they wished us a happy anniversary, they obviously bothered to put this in their system. Very clean and luxurious hotel, well situated to get anywhere in the city and an amazing breakfast but would say their staff make it extra special, thanks everyone ",5,2023,08,22
115,A perfect location in London,"From the time you are greeted by Carmen, who was always so pleasant, at the door, check in with the wonderful reception team and meet Ivan, the very knowledgeable, helpful and professional concierge, you know your stay at this gem of a hotel is going to be an enjoyable one. We had great breakfasts in the Terrace room where the service was fantastic and the food delicious, esp the Eggs Benedict!   We can’t thank Maria and the whole team for their impeccable service, it was a perfect way to start the day. Afternoon tea in the Coral Room was delightful, The hotel is in an excellent location and just minutes from the British Museum. Shopping and restaurants all within walking distance. It is undergoing some exterior renovations but fortunately this didn’t interfere with our stay.",5,2023,08,20

Good location for the British Museum and lots of other interesting places nearby. ",5,2023,08,14
115,Disappointed,"Staff are lovely can’t fault them. 
Hotel is certainly not what I would expect for £200 a night and 4 stars : 
Clean but very basic and in much need of updating. 
Lots of other places to stay in London for much less that are far nicer.",3,2023,08,13

Special thanks to the front office manager, Emmanuel. We loved the hotel,  it’s small and comfortable, and it lies in the middle of a lively part of London, even though the area of the hotel itsself is really quiet. The perfect mix. It’s an old hotel with renovated rooms and the rooms are really nice and cozy. Breakfast was great. Good quality and lots of choices. We are looking forward to coming back soon.",5,2023,08,12

We had previously stayed in the hotel and were left really disappointed. We were encouraged to visit again and we did over the august bank holiday.

From the time we arrived we were made feel really welcome
Nadiya on the desk was so personal and friendly and actually remembered us.
Our room was fantastic very happy with it.
Location was very central.
Everytime staff member we encountered greet us by name a really nice touch.
Ambience and smell in common areas was really welcoming a lovely aroma.

Cockails in coral room are some of the best I had in London.
We enjoyed jazz in the bar on Saturday night.
Breakfast was great.
However the staff in all aspects of the hotel are the stars of the show. They could not have been more friendly or helpful. Whoever hires and trains these amazing people deserves pat on the back.

Rest assured we will be back",5,2023,08,08
115,We will be returning it was excellent.,"We are 4 ladies on a business trip. The 4 rooms and bathrooms were well appointed and the bathrooms were wonderful lit for make up Beds were very comfortable we all slept well as it was so quiet. 
The staff were excellent and the breakfast catered for absolutely everyone - masses of choice. This has now become our go to venue for our business stays. ",5,2023,08,05
115,Faultless,"Exceptionally clean, welcoming and well positioned, I will be back! One of the few decent central hotels that offer smaller single occupancy rooms. 

The reception team were so genuinely warm and welcoming. Breakfast offered lots of choice. The service in the Coral Room Bar was wonderful and the terrace looked beautiful, although I didn’t eat there in this occasion. 

Overall, a great experience. ",5,2023,08,05
115,Tnx Maria fir a wonderful breakfast,"Breakfast hospitality like no other. 
Last time I wrote about the wonderful team at the reception, this time I want to share the wonderful experience with the team at the breakfast room- all led by Maria Villaflor. 
It’s very impressive to see how Maria remembers each and every guest, their name, their food and beverage preferences, even when 20 guests are arriving at once. Always with a smile, multitasking, making you feel welcome. 
All of the team members (Andreea, Thomas, Maciejh and Alex T) follow Maria’s lead and do their outmost to provide you with the most caring service. What a great way to start the day. Thank you Maria and team!",5,2023,08,05
115,Best service!,"If you want to have a great service in the good location, that's the hotel to stay in. Lately, you feel a bit reserved about what to expect from the hotels, The Bloomsury staff made our stay very pleasant. Special thank you to the team at Breakfast:Maria, Estelita, Andrea, Gabriela, Thomas, Layla Mohammed, Piotr and to the Dalloway Terrace - Andrey. Thank you to Sebastian who took care of our request and a maintenance person, who fixed the problem with the sink and hot water supply.",5,2023,08,02
115,Great venue for a long weekend.,"This was my first visit to Bloomsbury, and it will not be my last. This is a great London bolt hold, which is within easy walking distance to one of my favourite locations, the British Museum, as well as theatre land.

Staff: Everyone was hyper-attentive and considerate. This is easily one of the best staff I have encountered at a hotel. Maria, who ran the breakfast room, was great and seemed to remember my name every time I came down for breakfast which I had never encountered before. I wish I had that skill! The reception managers, porters and waiters were all on top of everything. 

Dining and entertainment: The breakfast was 5-star - I recommend smoked salmon and poached eggs. We also dinned at the Dalloway Terrace, a very pleasant summer venue. Our favourite location was probably the club bar, which has live music and an intimate feel. 

Price: Not bad at all for this location and London generally. There was a 20% summer deal which we took advantage of.

Location: Perfect if you like Bloomsbury, which we do. The entrance is nicely tucked away and feels like a secret venue. 

Overall: 5 stars. 

",5,2023,07,31
115,I’d stay there again,"Room was comfortable and spotless. Very pleasant and welcoming Reception staff. Convenient location since it is close to the heart of London. Only downside was the chap who is supposed to organise taxis. I asked at Reception for a cab and was swiftly whisked out of Reception down to the cab that had been ordered for someone else who was also present. Taxis came and went - I was sure I’d been forgotten and eventually I left in one, only to discover that I’d missed my train and had to pay a hefty amount to travel   on another train.  Taxi drivers know well the chaos outside the hotel which is an unpleasant contrast with the interior.",4,2023,07,29
115,A Delightful Place to Stay!,"The Bloomsbury is a wonderful hotel with exceptional customer service. Every staff member was not only courteous and kind, but extremely helpful. For example, the morning of our departure flight, my partner and I were going to take the train. We were unaware that this particular train had very long delays, but the staff at Bloomsbury alerted us and then found us an alternative route. Very helpful staff and lovely hotel with a great bar and delicious drinks for a perfect nightcap.",5,2023,07,27
115,The best boutique hotel in London,I am a returning visitor to this hotel and it is easy to see why. It is the staff that makes a good hotel great and they are impeccable in all areas especially at the breakfast room and the reception where they are so friendly and serve with a smile.I will not hesitate to recommend this fantastic hotel to anyone who would like to have a home away from home in the heart of London,5,2023,07,24
115,Amazing Stay at the Bloomsbury,"The Wife and I made a trip here in July 2023.  The only issue we had with the Hotel was the Check-In process.  We arrived early around Noon and had to wait until almost 3:00 PM to get into our room.  We requested an early check-in but was ultimately unable to get the room prior to 3:00 PM.

Room was spotless - very clean. . . the daily room service was excellent - always had clean towels, bed was made when we got to the room after a day of sightseeing.  When we did return to the room the bed was turned down with chocolate on the table and slippers by the bed.  Just top notch room service.

Restaurant was good - no complaints here. We ate here at the Coral Room which is an amazing place to stop for afternoon tea or a drink before returning to the room.  The Dalloway Terrace is a bit more formal dining area - we sat outside one night for an amazing meal.  I would suggest reservations at both especially on the weekends.

Location could not be better - is a bit secluded off the beaten path and a couple blocks from the Tottenham Court Road Underground Station.  Lots of small stores in the area to pick up bottled water, snacks, etc for a long day sightseeing.  Lot's of good Restaurants within walking distance especially in the Covent Garden area.  The Concierge here was very helpful - gave us some good recommendations for our last day in London.

Absolutely we would stay here again if we return to London which I hope we do as there is still a lot we did not see in our short 6 day's in the City.   ",5,2023,07,23
115,Fabulous hotel in the heart of the West End,"After our visit to the Dalloway Terrace and The Bloomsbury Club in March we decided to celebrate a 20 year anniversary with a one night stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel. The whole experience was great and we felt very spoilt. The room was lovely with good fixtures and fittings, luxury products in the room and white fluffy bath robes which we loved.

The Bloomsbury was a great location being the heart of the West End. We had drinks in the hotel bar before venturing out and then went to theatre, had a quick bite to eat and ended up back at the The Bloomsbury Club for first class cocktails with the live 3 piece jazz band. It doesn't get better than this!

Breakfast was the highlight, a great buffet selection with the finest vegan muffins I've ever tasted, a great a la carte menu included where you could order anything. I had smoked salmon, poached eggs, avocado, mushroom with their speciality Guinness bread. 

Highly recommend The Bloomsbury!",5,2023,07,23
115,Wonderful hotel. Hidden gem!,"Fantastic stay at this gorgeous hotel.
Loved the cosy rooms. The cool Coral Room bar and also the late night jazz bar downstairs with the best cocktails and servers! Exceptional service.
 This hotel offers something for everyone. Centrally located. We shopped ate and visited the theatre all by foot then finished our evening downstairs with the best cocktails and live Jazz.
We stayed 1 night
 Slept well and had the such a sumptuous breakfast with so much choice and wonderful service.
Shame we couldn't stay longer. Great hotel and great service 
",5,2023,07,23
115,"Charming hotel, excellent location and a wonderful staff","The Bloomsbury Hotel has everything you’d hope for from a luxury boutique hotel in London; an excellent location, walking distance to the Tottenham tube, Seven Dials, Soho, Covent Garden and the British Museum. Comfortable beds and spotless housekeeping. The Coral Room, an opulent-looking, on-site bar with skilled bartenders, frequented by posh locals. Plus a live jazz speakeasy in the basement, and a very decent terrace restaurant.

But it is the staff at the Bloomsbury that really sets it apart.

From the moment we were warmly greeted at the front door, to the front desk, the concierges, housekeepers, porters… in fact, every person we encountered at the hotel seemed genuinely interested in our well-being, kind, polite and endlessly helpful. And that is something you don’t always find these days, even at the finest hotels. For us, it made all the difference!

We stayed for five nights; then, having planned a rather precarious travel itinerary, we checked out and headed to Euston with all of our luggage, only to stand for the next few hours and watch as every single train was cancelled – including our own!

Suddenly stranded, we fled back to the hotel, and threw ourselves upon the managers’ mercy; and thankfully, although it was the height of the season in early July, both Marcela and Ricardo – and indeed, the entire front desk – created magic, and worked hard to find us not just another room – but the perfect room that somehow, met all of our preferences! 

In the end, we stayed for two more nights, then three more after that. And although we did have to switch rooms (for guests with prior reservations, did we mention high season?), the staff made the transition happen seamlessly, and each room was just as we’d requested (high floor, quiet, king bed and so on). 

In short, The Bloomsbury became a safe port for us; and for that, we are very grateful.

There are some lovely amenities in the rooms. The Malin + Goetz bath products. A quick-boil electric teakettle with complimentary tea bags and cookies was a welcome touch at the end of a long day; as were the soaking tubs in the bathrooms. And while some of the rooms are on the cozy side (it is London, after all…), the beds were always plush and comfortable, and the air conditioning excellent. We slept very well.

A few suggestions for dining in the neighborhood; The Bloomsbury Street Kitchen, a few blocks away, has inventive, delicious dishes. For Indian fare, Punjab (a small, classic, family-run restaurant) and Dishoom (excellent cocktails and a festive, convivial atmosphere) were each worth waiting for in the lines out front. Sticks ‘n’ Sushi in Covent Garden has decent pan-Asian fare. That said, there are endless options within walking distance of the hotel.

We enjoyed our stay at The Bloomsbury a great deal, and hope to return some day. Thank you again to the managers and to the wonderful staff, for making our trip so memorable.",5,2023,07,22
115,A serene oasis of calm in the centre of London,A beautiful gem in the heart of London.  Amazing customer service with very friendly helpful staff- Nayeema in particular at the front desk. The room was spotless and very comfortable. Such a serene and peaceful ambience. We will definitely be back.,5,2023,07,22
115,Best Hotel in Central LDN,"One of the best experiences I have ever had in a hotel, everyone in the hotel was so friendly and always had a smile in the face. I definitely wanna return again very soon. Also very well located near Covent Garden & Tottenham Court Road Station. Special shout to some people in the staff like: Alejandra, Antonio, Cristian, Toni, Sebastian.",5,2023,07,21
115,Very lovely hotel,"The hotel was excellent, we spent lovely 3 days in there. Nice rooms, lovely staff such as Marcela, Emanuel, Estelita from breakfast, and Vlada (I hope I remember correctly, from the bar). Very tasty financier amenity in the room. ",5,2023,07,19
115,Wonderful Stay,"First time back at the hotel since 2017 and I had a brilliant stay. 

Staff were welcoming and friendly, the room was spacious, immaculately presented with a lot of nice touches. Incredibly comfortable bed and great pillows. Breakfast was a perfect combination of buffet, hot food made to order and beverages. 

Thoroughly enjoyed my stay.",5,2023,07,17
115,such a good service,"the service and the staff are really superb.
Rooms are very well cleaned and served.
We had breakfast everyday at the hotel restaurant and we were surprised with such a good service! Maria, patricia, Yulita , Tara , Andrea and Piotr , were very kind and made their best to give a warm good start of the day.
The concierge and porters very helpful, and we the ambiance is quiet and pleasant.",5,2023,07,16
115,"Go for the Location, Service and Chic Coral Room",This was my second stay at The Bloomsbury and I just love this property. The central location just a block from Tottenham Court Road underground and the British Museum is a real plus. The chic Coral Room is a welcome spot for a cocktail or nightcap. The breakfast room in the lower level not only served up a great buffet but also lovely made-to-order options and coffee drinks. The best touch was the warm welcome we received each morning from Maria and Estelita and attentive service by Mohammed. ,5,2023,07,16
115,Three 25 yr old girls LOVED The Bloomsbury,"The hotel was a wonderful boutique with 2 restaurants that were uniquely special (a garden outdoor feel and the other, a modern light, young, fun atmosphere).  The staff was so friendly and helpful….the front desk especially.  If I needed a reservation, they got it for me.  We absolutely loved the Bloomsbury. The staff I’d like to mention are:  Maria, Andrea, Patricia, Tara, David, Mohammad, Piotr, Clara and Sunaina. Thank you!!!",5,2023,07,11
115,A great boutique hotel in the heart of London,"An excellent hotel in the heart of Londen.   THe location (at Tottemham court road), the atmosphere, the rooms, the stuff, the breakfast, the jazz bar -  GREAT. There were some technical / maintenance things that could be better but we will definitely come back. ",5,2023,07,11
115,The warmest welcome.,"Leaving aside the excellent food, the location and the striking interiors, I would go to the Bloomsbury for the welcome alone. From the charm and efficiency of Suhaina on Reception, to the cheeriness of Maria at breakfast, you feel at home at the Bloomsbury. And not forgetting Marta, who unexpectedly arranged an upgrade for me, despite my having stayed only once before. Here’s hoping I need to stay in London again -soon!",5,2023,07,10
115,Perfect. In every way.,"My wife and I stayed at this fantastic hotel in February as part of her birthday celebrations, and it was everything, and more, that we could have wished for.

From the warm greeting, to the exceptional service throughout, this hotel team went above an beyond at every turn. 

The staff were wonderful. Polite, knowledgable and attentive in every way. We were especially taken by the service of the lady who looked after us at breakfast, recalling our names as we left, and wishing us a good day. A testament to her attention to detail, considering the amount of customers she had met that morning.

The suite we were lucky enough to stay in was breathtaking. Beautifully designed, but managing to avoided the 'style over function' flaws that many other hotels suffer. It felt as comfortable and inviting as it looked. Before our stay, had we put together a wish list of luxury features for a room, this suite would have ticked every box. We didn't want to leave.

Thank you to the management and all the staff. It was a glorious stay, so much so that I have booked a surprise return visit later this summer for our anniversary. I've not even booked our show tickets yet, this was first on the list.",5,2023,07,08
115,Exceptional Experience,"Our experience staying at this hotel was outstanding!  The staff are very courteous, friendly, and helpful.  The accommodations were very comfortable and the breakfasts and food on the terrace was delicious. Big shoutout to Dale, Tara, Maria, Andreas, Yulia, and Gobiela for their amazing service.  Would definitely stay there again in the future.",5,2023,07,07
115,Relaxed and luxurious environment with Friendly staff,"Spent the afternoon working from the Coral room, excellent service, tasty light lunch and drinks. The club sandwich contunes to be a favourite. Friendly staff and comfortable seating.  The perfect environment to relax a d get things done.",5,2023,07,07
115,Good times @ The Bloomsbury ,"Visited with my sister in law and had a great time! Located in Central London, lots of walkable cages, entertainment and restaurants. Hotel is decorated tastefully, we took lots of photos. High tea was great, flowers 💐 on the terrace are great for photos & add to an enchanting experience. Tea service was impeccable! Norbert & Gregory were so helpful at the front desk. Zach & the bartender in the club bar offered great cocktail suggestions and were attentive. The Coral Room is spacious and has a timeless look. The staff, bartenders are friendly, literally EVERYONE was lovely 😊.
Concierge answered all our questions and gave us great directions too! 
Tonight there was a DJ in the Coral Room - she played great music, vinyl only. Every staff member we encountered was delightful and helpful. We danced for hours and other guests did too. Great times 🥸. A+++",5,2023,07,06
115,The Bloomsbury never disappoints!,"It's the perfect hideaway in London inmidst the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street! From the minute you arrive one really feels taken care off by the cheerfull and attentive staff... a good sign for great management!
We stayed in a room on the top floor, really cosy an the amenities of Malin+Goetz are devine! Breakfast needless to say is delicious (I recommend the eggs royal) , and Estelita will make sure you have a great start into the day!!
We hope we return very soon :)",5,2023,07,05
115,Excellence quest this place for tips,"Dined at the Dalloway terrace with a friend to try the experience. Started at the restaurant and finished at the club bar for a post dinner. Outstanding!!!! From the reception to the bar, all staff is nice and professional. Cordial, nothing can beat it. The food is delicious, great compliments to the chef Francesco.
The receptionist Marcela and Sarah were super welcoming and escorted us to our table in  no time. Once there we were approached by the FB manager Max who invited us to enjoy some bubbles before our dinner which we promptly accepted 😁. Following with the service, the waitresses Madalina and her helper Shukrah were super attentive and made us feel like we didn't miss anything. After our meal, George escorted us to the Bloomsbury Club Bar where we had a couple of note drinks in a lovely and cozy ambient which was perfect to chill and digest as we were still feeling amazed and full by the food. Once again the staff made it special. A big thank you to all, Sarah, Marcela, George, Madalina, Shukrah, Vlada, Zac, Marco and Russell.",5,2023,07,04
115,Disapointed,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel last week and was checked in by Marcela. She was very unprofessional and seemed like she couldn’t get rid of us fast enough! I asked her a few questions i had and she very quickly shut me down, i was shocked to see a manager with so much attitude! Apart from the unpleasant check-in we had, the room was lovely and the Coral Room staff were extremely friendly.",2,2023,07,03
115,Weekend Stay,"The first time we have stayed at the Bloomsbury. The hotel is great, lovely decor, the rooms were very nice and good air conditioning which was needed. Also beds and pillows really comfy Good location quite central to get to most locations. The staff are great from the moment you walk in from the concierge, to the reception staff and the restaurant staff.

The only down side. My partner and i went down to the Coral Bar on our first night for a drink. We walked in looked for a table, only to be what i can describe of being accosted by a a couple of members of staff asking if we have booked? We just wanted a drink at the bar. Didn't know you had to book, i have never come across this before in any hotel i have stayed in. This made my partner feel a little uncomfortable so put us of going back in there during our stay.

115,First stay at the Bloomsbury hotel,"Very nice hotel, I had great room with very efficient AC which was important as it was hot in London! Location is ideal 2mins walk to the Elizabeth and central line and the staff were all extremely helpful. Will be back soon. ",5,2023,06,30
115,Recommend Bloomsbury Hotel,Exceptional staff who were very accommodating and friendly. Rooms were comfortable with heated bathroom floor. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The pillows were exceptional! Never had such good pillows. Would strongly recommend it : a quiet relaxing stay.,5,2023,06,26
115,Jewel in the heart of London,"Amazing stay at the Bloomsbury! The staff is cordial, rooms are clean and well appointed, breakfast is delicious, hotel itself is beautiful and outstanding location and did I already mention the staff, they couldn’t have been more helpfull and joyfull! This will be my go to hotel in London. Do not even think any other hotel, visit the Bloomsbury and you don’t want to leave.",5,2023,06,19
115,Fantastic staff!,"We had such a wonderful experience at the Bloomsbury!  The hotel itself is lovely and in a great location, but the staff is really what stood out.  Everyone was incredibly friendly and accommodating, and really went out of their way to make sure that we had everything we needed.",5,2023,06,18
115,Solo travel made comfortable.,"Great location, lovely hotel. Room for one was perfect. The location is great. Near the Tottenham Court tube station. Very close to the the theatre district (walkable). I had room service for breakfast one morning which was really a treat. Well presented. Hot. Lovely. ",5,2023,06,16
115,Beautiful Gem in Bloomsbury....a winner! Seriously!,"When I travel to London, I opt for the Bloomsbury area of London. The area is close enough to walk to sights but very much like a local neighborhood. Access to local cafes, the University is nearby so there are students. Access to local grocers, pubs, and shops for any necessities needed...and ATM's. I usually book at a Bed and Breakfast nearby, but they were completely booked. So I found online the Bloomsbury Hotel. I was concerned that the only room I could book at the Bloomsbury as a solo business traveler was their ""Cozy Room"" #809. European standards for rooms are often much smaller and tighter compared to American hotels. The room exceeded my expectations. The bathroom is marble with black granite sink basin. The room was spacious enough for a desk, wardrobe, armchair, opening my suitcase..and a window with nice sunlight. It was perfect. The closet door had a full-length mirror, a mirror over the desk, and of course, a nice mirror in the bathroom. I would book this room again. The bed was full-size with nice bedding and pillows. A/C and nice lighting throughout. The hotel amenities include bathrobes and slippers, iron, fluffy white towels, a deep bathtub, and a shower. The bathroom counter is small but spacious enough for toiletries. Complimentary hotel toiletries= high-end brand. The room was fresh looking and nicely appointed...as is the rest of the hotel: A boutique hotel with stylish lounges and a bar. The main entrance of the hotel faces an internal street and is perpendicular to the High Street. The restaurant is lovely. The menu is great, and the service is memorable. Intimate and pretty. The second night I dined, a different waiter noted that I had an allergy which I had shared with a totally unrelated waiter the night before. That is extraordinary. I would come back again and again. Greg, the morning Hotel Manager, was incredible and ensured I was taken care of as I waited for my airport taxi at 4:30 AM. The only complaint I had....which is something I encounter at hotels everywhere, is being able to access my room upon arrival after an international flight. I was on business and really needed to sleep and shower but instead, I waited around in the lounges...even dozed off until my room was accessible at 3 PM. I sent a request prior to arrival, but it could not be accommodated. There should be some way to accommodate international business travelers. That aside, The Bloomsbury Hotel is a winner!",5,2023,06,14
115,Great Hotel!,"Amazing hotel, I was in the suite, really big one with a great bath and bed.

Alegandra from the reception was very pleasant, helpful and with great vibes and energy.

Strongly recommended, for sure I will come back this hotel",5,2023,06,13
115,Spectacular Experience at The Bloomsbury Hotel,"Our 3 day stay was the most spectacular hotel experience. The property itself is lovely - spacious rooms, dining options, the brilliant Coral Room bar, live jazz in the evening, and proximity to everything. The Bloomsbury staff made it a 5 star experience from beginning to end. Ricardo Esteves, Guest Experience Manager, is truly the best of the best. Cannot wait to return!",5,2023,06,13
115,Outstanding stay,"I regularly stay in hotels in London whilst on business and can say that this will now be my number 1 choice. I stayed here for three nights. The staff, and  in particular Nayeema were outstanding, very attentive. All of them were a credit to the hotel. Room was amazing, bar was fantastic and the food was amazing. Thanks for everything, I’ll be back shortly! ",5,2023,06,12
115,"The best, luxurious hotel in London","If I could give this review more stars I would. We had my husband's birthday here and we stayed the night. Everything, from organising the event to checking-in, to the attentive staff, the room, the Coral Bar, Dalloway Terrace, the Bloomsbury Club and the breakfast was exceptional. The GM Susanne and her staff were amazing - so attentive, friendly and they couldn't do more to help you. We had drinks in the beautiful Coral Bar - a stunning experience in itself, then a dinner for 12 friends at Dalloway Terrace - everything was delicious - especially the Guinness bread and prawns. We then went to the Bloomsbury Club for more drinks - live music, refined cocktails and a really cool and diverse crowd. When we eventually made it to the comfiest bed in the world, the staff had placed a large bottle of water on each side and a bar of chocolate. Eating chocolate in bed at 3am was so indulgent and much needed. It's those little unexpected surprises that makes The Bloomsbury, so, so special. The hotel is located in the heart of London, but on a back street, so it's lovely and quiet. It's got energy, intimacy and lashings of personality. I would recommend this place to everyone - you won't regret it! ",5,2023,06,11
115,Lovely hotel and staff but tiny bathroom ,"Very nice hotel. We stayed for 8 nights and were generally really pleased with the accommodations, staff and food. We ate breakfast each morning at the hotel and the staff members were exceptionally nice and efficient, and the food was reasonably priced. We also enjoyed drinks and bar food in the Coral Room (shout out to Hannah who was a delight). We ate dinner a few times on the Terrace which was also nice but not exceptional. Loved the goodies box in the room that was replenished each day. My only (and significant) complaint was the bathroom which was incredibly and ridiculously small, with a pedestal sink and no nearby shelving. It was very difficult to maneuver in the bathroom so I would recommend travelers avoid room 609. I feel the hotel should consider making adjustments to the size of that bathroom for the sake of guest comfort and experience. The bedroom itself was lovely and adequately sized with delightful linens on the bed. I would definitely stay there again but would ask to see the room at check-in.",4,2023,06,08
115,Love this Hotel,"We love this hotel.  The staff is first rate across the board from the moment we arrived until the time we left the front desk staff, concierge, staff in the Coral Room were gracious and professional.  Housekeeping services which are often overlooked were unobtrusive and made the room very inviting with their turn down service which was welcomed after a day exploring London.",5,2023,06,06
115,delightful experience,"If the Bloomsbury Hotel undeniably offers an experience of quality, serenity and comfort, it is first and foremost thanks to its staff. The friendliness and professionalism of the breakfast team, led by Maria, are particularly noteworthy. It's the first step of the day and the team's attention is a delight. ",5,2023,06,06
115,"Over the years, I have stayed at many hotels, from Los Angels CA to Barcelona , Spain The Bloomsbury ranks in the top  3","This was my first time in London.  I stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel and I cannot say enough good things about The Bloomsbury.  The hotel was luxurious, my room was immaculate and well appointed.  But the best part of the Bloomsbury was the staff, everyone was polite and welcoming and always willing to help.  I would be remiss not to give a shout out to Nayeema and Suhaina, the two girls working the front desk who spent an enormous amount of time with me helping to get me checked into my flight back to Arizona, both of them literally walked the extra mile to ensure I was checked in properly.  The premium lodgings, plus high-quality staff members e.g. Nayeema and Suhaina insure all of my future business when I visit London.   David  ",5,2023,06,05
115,That personal touch,"My Mam and I stay at The Bloomsbury every year when we visit London. Always brilliant customer service. Reception staff are friendly, concierge Ivan always takes an interest in you and has a good knowledge of London, places to visit etc . Breakfasts are beautiful.  Maria and her team are fab. Maria is very kind, and again that personal touch of she recognises us and goes out of her way to ensure we have everything we need. Will be looking forward to seeing Maria and Ivan next year on our annual trip.",5,2023,06,05
115,Best Hotel in London!!,"This was my second visit at the Bloomsbury, and it was nothing less than perfect.
Best customer service imaginable. The reception,  the concierge and the breakfast team go out of there way to make your stay perfect 
Outstanding location.
   ",5,2023,06,04
115,Wow!,Wow what a hotel! I have stayed in a lot of hotels and not only was the hotel beautiful the customer service was outstanding. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we felt like the only guests at the hotel. It so not matter where we were each member of staff went out their way to make sure we were happy and see if there was anything they could do. I do not have the ladies name but the lady on reception who helped us when our car got broken into was amazing a real credit to the hotel. We will definitely be returning! ,5,2023,06,03
115,Wonderful extra long weekend at The Bloomsbury,"On arrival at the hotel I was greeted by one of the front of house staff who escorted me to reception.  The reception staff were very friendly and check in was flawless (as usual).
The upgrade to a junior suite was an extra bonus.  The room was very spacious for London with plenty of space to relax in. Also there was a box of wonderful macarons sitting on my desk. Breakfast in the newly refurbished trellis room was excellent.  The staff are always friendly and welcoming but they remembered me and made me feel that little bit special.  Special thanks must go to Maria, Patricia and Tara.  

The only down side was the coral room.  Its a wonderful cocktail bar and is laid out very nicely. Unfortunately it has a tendency to be quite loud and I felt a little out of place as the patrons were a lot younger than me.  Although I must say that the staff looked after me very well.

115,Great Customer Service at Bloomsbury Hotel,"Staff at the hotel, both at reception and in the breakfast room, were excellent.  Particularly Maria. Made us feel very welcome and were extremely attentive. We also had a great checkin experience on May 24.",5,2023,05,31
115,London? No worries: The Bloombury Hotel,"We have highly  appreciated the confort and quietness of this hotel .It is very well located specially if you plan a visit to the British Museum. At the reception ,Greg,Nayeema,and Norbert have been a real help in sorting out various questions. We highly recommend this hôtel if you plan a very pleasant stay in london",5,2023,05,31
115,Already planning my next visit!,"I felt VERY spoiled from check-in to check-out - Shaina, Ivan, Sidney, and Marta and the rest of the team  took very good care of me. If you get the chance, do as I did and have weekend brunch in The Coral Room - the mac and cheese in particular is excellent. 

Good location too, especially now the Elizabeth Line goes to/from Heathrow.

In a word - luxurious!",5,2023,05,29
115,"Friendly staff, great location.","The hotel's overall atmosphere and fibe are great.  The location is very central with good transportation options nearby.  The entire staff was super friendly and accommodating, but the breakfast crew deserves a special mention and shout-out.  Andreea, Maria, Estelita, Mohamad and Gabriela provided personalized service with a smile, something that is often hard to find these days.  Only drawback, the rooms are on the small side.",5,2023,05,28
115,Love Marco! ,"Loved the cocktail bar.  Amazing jazz music and incredible cocktails based on tarot cards. Our server was Marco who was absolutely incredible. Wonderful service, food, drinks, and ambience. Will definitely be back.",5,2023,05,28
115,Wonderful experience,Wonderful hotel. The staff are excellent and the location is central but a total oasis the moment you step down the private road.

Our waiter at the end made a reservation and escorted us to the jazz bar downstairs which made it a perfect night - an extraordinary evening and stay.,5,2023,05,28
115,Wonderful,"Our fourth stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel and long may it continue!

A pleasant greeting on arrival. We were offered 2 complimentary cocktails to celebrate my husband's birthday, which we enjoyed in the Coral Room. The Fools & Horses cocktail has sadly left the menu, such a shame as it was our absolute favourite! 

We stayed in a deluxe king room this time, situated at the end of the second floor, so it was lovely and quiet. A tasty little box of macarons and birthday card was placed in the room. Yummy! 

We had breakfast in the room the following morning. A great cooked breakfast and the bircher muesli was delicious!

Thank you once again for a very pleasant stay. 

For those of you who like to drive into town, there is a car park only 5 minutes walk to the hotel, £20 for 24 hours.",5,2023,05,23
115,"Elegant hotel, tucked away on Great Russel St with very quiet rooms","What luck for us to experience the epitome of British hospitality for our first nights in the UK. Every staff member we encountered was extremely courteous and all made a note of knowing us by name. The Coral Room is a lovely art deco setting, the open air dining room is very cozy and breakfast in the trellis room has all you could want. Very close to the British Museum and plenty of restaurants",5,2023,05,20
115,Comfortable and perfect hotel,"Beautiful installations, good location, comfortable and luxury queen room. Servicial and nice attendance of Ivan, Nayeems, Shardomey, Marta and specially Alejandra.

The hotel is in a great location, very close to Tottenham Court Road station and the British Museum.

115,Fun stay at The Bloomsbury,"Had a very comfortable stay at The Bloomsbury, breakfast is fabulous & a special mention has to go to Nayeema & Suhaina the two ladies on the front desk who were so friendly & welcoming, the front door Porters were also extremely efficient. The Coral Room Bar is a must if visiting!",4,2023,05,13
115,Top notch boutique hotel,"This place is just about perfect. Traveled with my friend We had twin beds which fit nicely into a small but very acceptable room. Bathroom was a bit small.
The hotel staff is a highlight. So accommodating and willing to please. A smile on their faces and reassured us even when we blew out the electricity with a hairdryer. Clara and Nayeema at the front desk were a delight.  Full bar, amazing breakfast, good restaurant and even jazz in the evening. 
We’d go back. .",5,2023,05,12

115,Coral cocktails at the Coral Room,I met with a friend at the Coral Room and we had some delicious bar snacks and ordered cocktails. Our server was Shelina - she was lovely and got us our drinks.

115,Superb hotel in a fab location ,"The perfect base for our girls' trip to London.
Just a stone's throw from Tottenham Court Road station where we used the Elizabeth line to travel to/from Heathrow.
Right beside the theatre district - we walked everywhere!
The polite, pleasant and professional service we received from all the staff made our stay special.
Dinner in Dalloway Terrace was divine and cocktails in the Coral Room were amazing

115,A wonderful and relaxing time ,"I stayed in the Bloomsbury hotel last weekend and had a wonderful stay.  The staff were superb, very attentive and always greeted with a smile.  The room we stayed in were very spacious and comfortably. Our first night we had dinner in the Dalloway on the beautiful terrace and the food was delicious, a cocktail then sampled in the Corral Room which I loved.  The hotel is so close to many tourist attractions Soho, Convent Garden, Trafalgar Square, Oxford Street and I really liked that we could walk everywhere instead of having to use public transport or a taxi.  Looking forward to another stay as enjoyed the experience so much. Thanks again to the staff for making my trip so enjoyable.  ",5,2023,05,03
115,Super weekend at the incredible Bloomsbury Hotel London with its top class service and warm welcome plus 5star food-Kate,"Super stylish hotel with incredible interiors and relaxed ambience.

115,Beyond a 5 Star Experience,"I highly recommend that you plan a stay at The Bloomsbury when in London. I would like to thank the entire team at the Bloomsbury for making our stay such a memorable experience and especially Ricardo Esteves the Guest Experience Manager at The Bloomsbury.

Prior to our stay Ricardo sent an email asking if we were celebrating a special event. I shared with Ricardo that we were celebrating my wife's retirement from 25 years of teaching. When we arrived at The Bloomsbury we were greeted with a warm welcome from the front desk team. We were then escorted to our room by Ricardo which was upgraded the the most beautiful and well appointed suite. Ricardo had also arranged for a fabulous collection of chocolates to celebrate my wife's retirement. 

During our stay we had an excellent lunch at The Dalloway Terrace. I highly recommend experiencing The Dalloway Terrace during your stay. I also recommend making a reservation in The Coral Room which is an exceptional bar within The Bloomsbury. 

I can't say enough about The Bloomsbury and the entire team. We loved the entire experience and we will definitely say at The Bloomsbury whenever we are in London.",5,2023,05,02
115,Wonderful Experience,"Once again, enjoyed our stay immensely. Well taken care of, nothing is too much trouble, beautiful surroundings, cannot fault it. Stayed a few years ago and was so impressed The Bloomsbury was our choice of stay again. Did not disappoint, if at all possible, is better than the first visit. Thanks to Brian at the entrance who always greeted us with a welcoming smile and hep with luggage and doors and to Maria and the breakfast team who went above and beyond and to all the helpful staff. Well done!",5,2023,05,02
115,Wonderful Stay,"I had a wonderful stay at the Bloomsbury.  All hotel staff were warm, hospitable and authentic, ranging from the doormen to the housekeeping staff, making me feel at home during my stay.  Gregory and Norbert were very kind to arrange for an upgrade for my room in recognition of my GHA status, despite how well-booked the hotel was.  Together with Shardonnay and Ivan, the four of them always tended to any of my requests speedily and hospitably.  The layout of the room is also thoughtful and have the usual connections as well as features that one would expect for a modern hotel.",5,2023,05,01
115,Exceptional experience at The Bloomsbury!,"I'm just back from 10 days in London and Paris.  I stayed at The Bloomsbury Hotel just one of those nights. If I could do it over again, I would stay every night here! It's fantastic! From the moment I walked in, the friendly staff made me feel very welcomed. Shout out to Ricardo Esteves, the Guest Experience Manager for going above and beyond.  We were celebrating my sister's birthday, and they surprised her with chocolates, pastries, and complimentary cocktails. The room was beautiful, clean, and comfortable. The neighborhood was central and so convenient to many things in walking distance, but also easy access to the tube. We had afternoon tea onsite at the Dalloway Terrace and it was really great.  We also had cocktails at the beautiful Coral Room. Everything about this place is really exceptional. I highly recommend it and can't wait to stay again.",5,2023,05,01
115,One of the best hotel in London,"Absolutely perfect hotel, stuf and location. Thank you Maria, David, and Yulila  for great breakfast & service .

I advise everyone to book directly from the hotel official website - you get benefits like breakfast and free upgrade.",5,2023,05,01
115,It's about the people...,"We enjoyed everything about this hotel. Everything about our stay there was extraordinary. The location was wonderful, the accommodations lovely and clean, and the food was excellent. While all of that was topnotch, the aspect of the hotel that will bring us back were the people who work there.

From the moment we arrived everyone made us feel completely welcomed. Manager Emanuel Ortiz-Baeza, Clara, Alejandra, Dale and special thanks to Brian. Every one of them, and several I am leaving out went beyond being professional, showing genuine kindness toward us, and to other guests I observed.

After our initial stay we continued our travel in Europe, but our flight home was still out of London. We were so happy our vacation ended with one more night at the Bloomsbury. We look forward to returning and hopefully some of the same wonderful people there again. ",5,2023,04,30
115,The loveliest hotel and staff you’ll ever find.,A perfect hotel. From the minute you arrive you are made to feel welcome and special. From the concierge service who had my rumpled clothes pressed for me to the amazing housekeeping who were like invisible elves.  Special mentions go to Mohamed who brought my sumptuous breakfast on the first day to Patrice and her staff in the Trellis restaurant. Lovely Valentine in the Coral room and of course Colin on the concierge desk and all the guys on the door who were so welcoming and made me feel cared for. This is a hotel that welcomes you like a favourite family member. I never want to stay anywhere else. Thank you.,5,2023,04,29
115,Fantastic stay,"This hotel is situated so minutes away from Tottenham Court Tube station, where there are many lines taking you all over London and also within walking distance of many shopping streets. The rooms are very comfortable, the breakfast is great, includes both a Buffet and an a la carte menu. The staff are the best I have ever met in a hotel. So friendly and helpful, makes a point of addressing you by your name. And the extra turn down service in the evening, with a chocolate and slippers left by the end of the bed  adds that little extra. They also arranged car service for us from and back to the airport at a very reasonable price. ",5,2023,04,29
115,Historical beautiful hotel,"The staff and the location are outstanding. Breakfast is excellent. The history of the hotel is fascinating. I felt surrounded by the feeling of the artists and writers who had been part of the Bloomsbury Group.Our room was small and still just fine.

Special staff members :Patricia,Maria,Alexandra,Clara,Emanuel,and Dale.",5,2023,04,29
115,A night at the Bloomsbury ,The place is beautiful and the drinks in the bar downstairs are great. The tarot cards was a unique experience. Vlada tended to us well and was very friendly. The atmosphere and ambiance is great with live entertainment I recommend visiting even if not staying here.,5,2023,04,27
115,Fantastic stay during a week in London,"The Bloomsbury is an oasis in the middle of London! Great location near the underground, theaters, restaurants -- and especially the British Museum! The staff were uniformly wonderful, genuine and welcoming. The rooms were immaculate, though ours was a little oddly configured (stairs to the bathroom). The food at Dalloway Terrace was delicious, and breakfasts were great.",5,2023,04,27
115,Home away from home.,"Wonderful cozy hotel, excellent location, absolutely excellent 2 bars, and amazing staff, especially Marcela Manole- the best guest  relations manager and the most professional one. Each time I visit the Bloomsbury she makes it feel like home.",5,2023,04,24
115,Perfect solo trip!,"I stayed here as a solo getaway to do some shopping and relax.
The welcome by the staff was spot on and very helpful. The room was lovely, warm and relaxing. I felt very safe in this hotel as a female on my own. 
The bed was very comfortable and the food I had delivered to my room was amazing. 
The complimentary macaroons were a delicious bonus. 
I will definitely be returning soon!
Thank you for a perfect stay!",5,2023,04,24
115,Great stay at wonderful location,"We had a lovely time at Bloomsbury. All the staff at reception, Coral Room and Darroway Terrace were extremely helpful and nice. Extra special thanks to the breakfast team (Maria, Andrea, Tara, Patricia, David and Piotr) for making us feel really welcome every morning.

The room was excellent and the location of the hotel couldn't be better.",5,2023,04,24
115,Lovely birthday afternoon,"I went with my family and we had a lovely afternoon, The italian waitress Elena was so nice and kind since The beggining until The end. Thanks to The Bloomsbury staff as well and grazie mille per tutto Elena! 😁",5,2023,04,23
115,The most amazing boutique hotel stay.,"My husband and I decided to stay in The Bloomsbury hotel for my 50th birthday since it is a more luxurious hotel that we would normally stay in. It was definitely the right decision. We have had the most amazing stay. 

It is what I would call a ‘boutique hotel’. A hotel which has more character than a generic chain.  Each room has character and touches of luxury from the decor and fabrics to the little extra touches such as free drinks in the lovely lounge area. 

The staff are extremely welcoming and helpful and couldn’t do enough for us, such as opening doors, looking after luggage and hailing taxis.

The icing on the cake was that Clara in reception organised a free room upgrade for us from a standard room to a deluxe suite! We have never stayed in a room quite like it. It was beautiful with the most amazing bathroom, wide screen TV, robes, toiletries and coffee machine. They even came to the room with some happy birthday chocolates and vouchers for free cocktails!

The location is perfect; next to the Dominion theatre and a ten minute walk to Covent Garden.

If you are looking for a more upmarket hotel which is affordable for a special occasion then I would certainly recommend The Bloomsbury hotel. We will definitely be back again. 

Thank you so much to Clara and all the staff for the most wonderful 50th birthday. I will never forget it.",5,2023,04,22
115,Best Teams in Town ,"Shout out to the Breakfast Team (Maria, Patricia, Mohammed, David, Tara and Piotr) and to the ENTIRE Bar and Front Desk Teams: you make every stay special, every single time. Staying here is one of life’s great bonuses! ",5,2023,04,18
115,Exceptional exceptional hotel,"My family and I just completed eight days of travel, staying in three cities and three hotels.  We treated ourselves to very nice hotels - a family trip before our daughter heads off to college.  The other two hotels are highly ranked five star hotels.  Then we came to The Bloomsbury.  For reasons stated by other reviewers, it was the by far winner of the three.  It is now a home from home and a place to return to. 

Before we arrived, Ricardo was in touch with us to ensure that the hotel was prepared for whatever our plans were.  He pulled out multiple stops for us.  We wanted to attend the jazz lounge on one evening.  He ensured that our son, aged 16, would be able to join us.  We were attending a football game.  He ensured that the concierge had guidance ready for us.  Our daughter was interested in exploring vintage clothing stores, he had a list of great stores to explore.  There were treats in our rooms that were tailored and hugely appreciated.  Our kids got a nice treat box of chocolates that disappeared quickly.  Ricardo's engagement with us, even before we arrived, put us off to a great start.  Upon our arrival, we were greeted warmly.

Staff throughout the hotel were exceptional.  Arriving, Christian ensured that we did not touch bags, and organized to get them to our rooms.  I believe Anna was on the front desk.  She was warm and wonderful to chat with.  In the breakfast room, we were greeted by our names as we arrived in the morning.  I have no idea how folks pulled that off.

The decor throughout the hotel is magnificent.  Nothing is tired or faded.  The literary feel is throughout.  We did not drink at the Coral Bar.  And it was beautiful.  It matches up to photos.  We did have a fun evening in the Club Bar.  It has a tremendous speakeasy feel - and all very elegant.  We listened to pleasant jazz.  The bar has its own menu of cocktails.  We dined on the Dalloway Terrace.  We enjoyed heat lamps and blankets.  In our rooms, I enjoyed the Seamus Heaney portrait, and other thoughtful and tasteful literary / art touches.  ",5,2023,04,18
115,Give yourself the gift of The Bloomsbury!,"This is as high-level customer experience as I've ever had at a hotel.  During business travel and holiday, I've stayed in many luxury hotels, but the experience you'll have at The Bloomsbury will be unmatched.  Ask for Ricardo, who has a guest services role, and he will help you with your every need.  It was my auntie's 80th birthday celebration:  He handpicked a gardening book as a birthday gift for her because he knew she was interested in birds and gardening (he asked me in advance for her interests btw...)  I will return here again anytime I visit London because the staff (from the breakfast team, to concierge to lounge) made us feel like our comfort was their top priority.  ",5,2023,04,17
115,A lovely hotel,"I stayed here on vacation and was very happy with the quality and size of the room. It was a great location, very close to the tube and walking distance to lots of restaurants. If you're going to the British museum, this hotel is in the perfect location. Of special note, Maria, the manager of the hotel breakfast room, was pleasant beyond belief. She remembered everyone's coffee orders and worked all 6 days we were there. Clara at reception was very helpful at check-in, Dale was a friendly concierge, and Tristan was a stellar bartender.  This is the kind of hotel that holds the door open as you enter and exit. I highly recommend!",5,2023,04,17
115,All Around Wonderful Experience,"After 3 years of medical social work with no break during a deadly pandemic, I rewarded myself with a week in London, arranging to meet a friend who had moved away last year. This was, hands down, the best hotel experience I've had in London & possibly in the UK.  The physical hotel itself is beautiful & not at all worn down or tired looking.  My ""cozy"" room was predictably small - which I prefer - clean & very well appointed with everything I could want or need. The hotel's literary theme was even underscored by reading lights affixed to the bed (which I put to good use). My only frustration was the coffee cups don't properly fit the Nespresso machine (I made it work). That is a very minor glitch in my travel experience & frankly not worth a mention (I do so for comparison).  Best feature of this hotel?  My room was quiet.  If there were guests in the rooms next to mine I was barely aware of them.  And that is very important to me.

A word about staff:  every single person I encountered was calm & friendly & left me with the impression they enjoy working there.  A recommendation in itself, I think.

A word about breakfast room staff:  Maria and Patricia and the rest of the staff were lovely & attentive.  The breakfast was consistently very well done, fresh and abundant, with enormous variety offered.  

2 words about housekeeping: Impeccable & attentive.  My sparkling water & Nespresso were replenished daily, my bed turned down & a chocolate left bedside every evening.  I especially appreciated the housekeeper who turned my bottle of shower gel upside down when it started to get low :) Finally, Management, please give recognition to the housekeeper who working the 2nd floor the evening of April 9th; she unlocked the mystery of the sink plug with immediate care and humor. This interaction set the tone of my London vacation and I am grateful.

Thank you Bloomsbury Hotel for enhancing a delightful week in London.

115,lovely waitress and atmosphere,"we visited for a few drinks and were served by Vlada, who was a lovely waitress and took time to take pictures of us and desove the menu, she was super friendly and made us want to come back ! cannot recommend highly enough ! will be back again soon ..........",5,2023,04,15
115,Very good hotel all around,"Excellent service throughout including the restaurant and bar. Room was impeccable, bit on the small side but manageable for one person. The hotel and spaces feel intimate and inviting.  It’s an excellent location for my business needs and I plan on staying there several times later this year.",5,2023,04,13
115,"Simply, the best","The best hotel with the best staff ! Everyone so incredibly helpful and always with a smile!
Location is ideal for walking around London or nearby public transport, yet  very quiet ( no noise from traffic or late night passers by). Nothing is too much trouble for this hotel and it’s staff. Highly recommend as beautifully maintained and immaculately clean; and a few staff to mention that I met :

Ricardo, Marta and Suhina on Reception 
Dale , Concierge
Maria who managed her team expertly at breakfast : Andrea, Tara, David & Yulila.",5,2023,04,13

The breakfast choices were first class.
The afternoon tea was one of the best.
The room was very comfortable and spotless.",5,2023,04,12
115,The warm and luxury hotel,"A warm welcome was the start of a perfect stay - Ricardo, the guest experience manager, is absolutely fantastic! Our stay was 4 nights with the children aged 12 and 13 - the rooms were cozy with good beds. Maria together with the staff in the breakfast room made the start of the day the best. The hotel is highly recommended.",5,2023,04,11
115,Excellent stay,"This hotel made my wife and I have a lovely memory of London. Upon arriving at the reception, Suhaina & Ivan were very welcoming and friendly and helpful, they even showed us 2 different rooms to choose and Suhaina took her time to come with us to show the rooms. We loved our room.
Breakfast was delicious with a lot of varieties.
I would like to thank Andreea, Tara, Patricia, David, Lazlo and Oussama for their great services.
Location of the hotel is great and very close to the metro station. Lobby is very cozy and smell amazing. WiFi was great even in our room on the 8th floor.
The bar attached to the hotel is lovely, food, cocktails and snacks and the environment was amazing.
Check out was fast. Bathroom was great and water pressure was very good.
Ivan at the reception is an encyclopedia of good restaurants. He knows many restaurants for any budget.
Room service was great every evening they used to left us chocolates.
We will definitely come back to this hotel.",5,2023,04,10
115,A great location for a short break.,"The welcome on arriving at the hotel was very friendly and we were lucky as our room was ready. The bathroom was a little cosy, but the bed was very comfy and the room met our needs. Very good breakfast the next morning with friendly staff and an excellent spread. Both the full English and the pancakes were delicious. Particular mention to Patrice who kept our coffee regularly filled up.",4,2023,04,10
115,Do not go there,"Small and dark rooms; rude staff; you are not allowed to visit their terrace restaurant for a coffee/drinks unless you order a full dinner. Common area at the hotel looks as good as on pictures, although rooms (standard ones) are ridiculously small and dark. ",1,2023,04,10
115,Far exceeded our expectations…,"When you book a stay with such a highly rated hotel, there is always a level of expectation.  From the start, The Bloomsbury exceeded those expectations.

We had booked for Easter weekend.  Due to emergency line works we were faced with having to cancel our train booking and driving into London.  A brief moment of madness had us thinking about embarking on the almost 3 hour drive at gone 9pm.  A quick call to the hotel and they were able to accommodate our madcap adventure.

We arrived at 12.30am.  We were greeted on arrival as warmly as we would have been at 12.30pm.   We were welcomed to the hotel, asked about our journey and offered a full briefing with the essential information.  We were also upgraded to an amazing Studio Suite.  Norbert in particular was so helpful and informative.

Our room (722) was stunning.  A huge King bed, comfortable mattress, super size pillows, extra seating area, rainfall shower and bath with inbuilt TV!  Housekeeping was exemplary, even on the days we left the room late, with delicious chocolates left for our enjoyment.

Breakfast each day was freshly prepared and delicious.  Maria is honestly a credit to the hotel.  On leaving after our first breakfast she bid us farewell by name and greeted us warmly by name each day thereafter.  The continental breakfast is extensive and varied and freshly prepared customisable hot food was included in our booking.  The ingredients were obviously well sourced and prepared beautifully.  

I enjoyed the Coral Room and Dalloway Terrace and have reviewed separately, but to reiterate, the surroundings were beautiful, service exemplary and the Chablis delicious.  It was so lovely to chat with Daisy and Rui on my visit.  Daisy in particular was so attentive.

Our check out was as smooth and as warm as our check in.  The lady looking after us was being well trained and the personal touch was much appreciated.

It is always nice to get home after a trip away, but we were honestly sad to leave.  We had a wonderful stay and look forward to trying other hotels in the group and of course revisiting The Bloomsbury.",5,2023,04,09
115,Great hotel for tall people!,"We had a lovely stay at the Bloomsbury. We booked a classic room with king bed, but they very kindly upgraded us to a deluxe room with king. My husband is quite tall (6 feet 7 inches / 200 cm) so I did mention that in the booking to ensure the best possible option for him (as some rooms showed sloped ceilings). The ceiling height was great, and the room was spacious as well as impeccably clean. The room was well appointed (Malin & Goetz products, robes, slippers, excellent towels.) The bed was very comfortable. Good size bathroom, although the stall shower is a bit narrow (the bathroom also included a large tub). Our room was very quiet - it faced the interior courtyard -and we did not hear any other guests. We also had the included breakfast with our stay - it was excellent. A choice of an entrée as well as a lovely buffet area with fruit, yogurt, meats and cheeses, breads, etc. We enjoyed a cocktail one night and tea/coffee one afternoon in the Coral Room as well during our stay. The location was incredibly convenient to the tube, particularly when coming from the airport as well. Off on a quiet side street but very close to activity. Staff was lovely and very helpful with bags. We would definitely stay here again!",5,2023,04,07
115,Perfect Location.  Outstanding Accomodations,Outstanding hotel.  Meticulous service.  Comfortable beds.  Connected to the Coral Room - a charming evening gathering spot.  Particularly taken with Ricardo Esteves a Guest Services Manager who was attentive and thorough in all aspects.,5,2023,04,06
115,Best way to spend a weekend!,"We had a 2 day stay at our favourite hotel & as always were treated like a king & queen. Beautiful, quiet & luxurious room with impeccable housekeeping. The reception headed by Marta & Ricardo & the team, Ivan, Greg, Kerm, Shardonnay & Suhaina are without exception utterly professional, very welcoming & cannot help you enough no matter how small or big your request. 
The breakfast we cannot fault. Under the friendly & attentive eye of Andreea, standing in for Maria & Estelita, she did you proud ladies, she led the team superbly during a very busy service. Well done & praise to her team, Tara, Coshin, Lazlo, Mohamad & David. 
You cannot stay here & not sit, imbibe & relax in the beautiful surroundings of The Coral Room. Great atmosphere & superb service thanks to Georgi, Shakira & Hannah. And of course delicious drinks, cocktails, & nibbles thanks David (& Gio). And if you sit at the right time of day, you must try the amazing home made scones! Looking forward to a return visit, & seeing all these incredibly professional & superb people & those I’ve not mentioned.",5,2023,04,05
115,Home from Home,"The Coral Bar was buzzing all weekend for afternoon tea, pre dinner drinks and after theatre drinks. The Bloomsbury Club downstairs is one of the best places to be after a night on the town and there’s great entertainment free of charge. 
As always, Ivan the ‘all helpful’ concierge was there to procure hard to get dinner and theatre tickets assisted by Marta in Reception. 
On the way down from the 6th floor in the lift I was informed by an enthusiastic honeymoon couple that the breakfast was superb and the service was fantastic. They said ‘they couldn’t do enough for us.’
The Bloomsbury breakfast is legendary under the eagle eye of newbie Andrea. 
Special mention for Georgi the manager of the Coral Room and Shakira who is a fantastic head waitress. 
We love The Bloomsbury hotel. It’s polished, professional and it’s like home from home.",5,2023,04,05
115,Would give 6 stars if I could,"Hotels are just places you stay in. It’s the people that make it special. Here they did in spades, although that said, the building is lovely. Booked for a 50th BD. I emailed Ricardo several times and he is a total star. Probably the best hotel guest relations I have ever met. He asked for the BD persons likes. Gin, (obs) and a gin making kit was waiting in the room with some welcome macaroons. This was hilariously almost confused with Gym, which would have scored me few brownie points!  On arrival the doorman greets you. Ricardo happened to be there too. He gave us a tour explained everything and secured our bags whilst we wandered off. We sat in the front room lounge area for a bit by the open fire.  Very lovely chilling spot. Even had drinks bought to us from the coral bar as they were very full in there. Superb service. Upon return we were guided to our room which had been upgraded to a suite. Superb room. I would never pay that much for a room though! The bathroom was massive. Full roll top bath. Lots of complimentary bits and bobs. I struggled to get the champagne I had brought into the fridge though. Had to empty it. Also coffee pod machine has no plug near it and hole where kettle goes too small. Had to move it to under tv. Bed huge and so comfy. Curtains blacked out well and room was soundproofed from outside. Breakfast was superb. Service here exceptional too though they seem understaffed they were amazing. Choice of a cooked dish then cold selection. Worth every penny. Perfect poached eggs. Delicious full English. Wonderful selection.  The coral bar is a sight to see. We had our free glass of English sparkling here as we had booked direct. Very nice does not do it justice. Gets busy in evening. We were turned away as they were full even though we were guests but Ricardo got us in and then took us to the downstairs bar sorted a table and we listed to the jazz band. Absolutely amazing space and an experience in itself. We would not have got in without Ricardo though. We had the pre theatre menu at the Dolloway Terrace. Fixed price which was a bargain really.  Included glass of English fizz  which was lovely. I got persuaded to get sides but these were not necessary. Wonderful space. Amazing service. This is a quirky hotel. Not too big and quite unique, nicely located for the theatre. We would happily return. What made the whole 50th perfect though was the staff who brought the whole experience together. I could not thank them enough and would return in a heartbeat.",5,2023,04,05
115,BEST STAY IN LONDON!,The staff was welcoming & helpful & charming! I was so pleased with my room. It was beautifully decorated. the bed was comfortable and it had all the amenities you could possibly need. It was truly a positive experience and I will stay again at this hotel. ,5,2023,04,03
115,Weekend staycation ,"We had an excellent weekend stay at the Bloomsbury. The front of house staff was very welcoming during our check-in. Our bedroom was elegant,  slick, very spacious, and, importantly, quiet. We really enjoyed our breakfast in the beautiful breakfast room with a great choice of à la carte and buffet dishes. The hotel is perfectly located to access theatres (it was our case) and other West End venues and restaurants.",5,2023,04,03
115,Impeccable service and friendly staff,We have been traveling around the  Uk for 2 weeks with my husband and our trip ended really well at the Bloomsbury. Ricardo was great and met all our requests and made our trip extra special. We can’t thank him enough.  Leonid at the Coral Room is one of the best bartenders we have ever met. Very friendly and has lot of knowledge about the drinks. The manager George made sure our meal at Dalloway Terrace was perfect. Great overall experience! We were so happy with the service❤️ We will be back for sure!!! ,5,2023,04,02
115,Exceptional,Currently staying until 2nd April in room 409. Service is 1st class staff very friendly and place lovely. Will come again. Also great position for all surrounding things to do. Thank you owners and staff exceptional.,5,2023,04,01
115,Truly 5 stars,"Outstanding from the minute we arrived until the minute we left!  The staff know your name.  They are always willing to go above and beyond and meet whatever need you may have.  The facilities are top notch, with very amazing beds, and extremely quiet rooms. The location- my favorite in London.  We couldn't be more pleased, and look forward to going back.  Amazing experience!",5,2023,03,31
115,Fabulous stay!,"Amazing hotel, a special mention to the breakfast team Andreea, Patricia, Yulia, David & Lazlo for making our breakfast a fantastic experience, we felt extremely accommodated and the food was to die for. Another shoutout to Brian the head concierge, he is a fantastic man who never failed to make us smile.  

We were given a coupon for 2 free cocktails and chocolate covered strawberries were sent to our room upon our arrival. 

I cannot emphasise how great this place is. ",5,2023,03,31
115,Unbelievable Stay That Didn't Disappoint,"My daughter and I visited London at the weekend and were very lucky to stay at The Bloomsbury.

From leaving the taxi outside each member of staff looked after us and made our trip very special.

The reception staff were very helpful and knowledgeable and made check in so seamless.

The bedroom was beyond what was expected.

We had room service which was delicious and thoroughly enjoyable.

We used the restaurant for breakfast which again didn't disappoint.

I would certainly recommend staying at the Bloomsbury Hotel for a truly special experience

",5,2023,03,23
115,A little bit if paradise.,"Beautiful hotel. Clean and spacious. Large comfortable beds, a little high if you're quite short though. I'm 5'4"" and I struggled a little getting up but once I was it was fantastic. Great pillows and duvets, wonderful night's sleep. Blackout blinds meant we overslept so I recommend a wake up call!! The staff are all lovely and super helpful. Brian in particular goes above and beyond. I am disabled and he really couldn't do enough to help me and make me feel more comfortable. The food is delicious. You should definitely stay for breakfast at the very least. A continental to beat them all and a full English with the best bacon I've ever tasted. Stunning bars and restaurants too. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. Perfect location for the theatres but almost a hidden but of paradise in the centre of London. We will definitely be going back. ",5,2023,03,23
115,Great Hotel,"What a wonderful place to be!  You’re always greeted with a  smile.  Our day starts with a full and hearty breakfast.  The staff are so friendly and caring and treat us like family.    What a joy to have you guys.  A big Thank You to Estelita, David, Oussama, Mohamed, Andrea and Patricia.  We had a great time in London.  Hope to see each other again.  Also thank you to Gregory who checked us out..very courteous and friendly.",5,2023,03,22
115,Magnificent Hotel,"Excellent service received from all staff  through out our stay.  Special thanks to Estelita and her team, David , Mohamed, Andrea, Patricia and Oussama for making our morning start right by serving delicious breakfast. They were fabulous, efficient, caring and very friendly.  Will definitely return to this hotel.",5,2023,03,21
115,Fabulous Hotel With Great Staff,"I stayed here for 5 days and had a fabulous time.  The hotel is in a great location and has lovely rooms.  But what really made the stay unique was the kindness of each and everyone on the hotel staff.  From the reception to breakfast room servers, everyone I encountered went out of their way to make my stay nice.  You can really tell when a hotel treats their employees well.",5,2023,03,21
115,Great staff,"We enjoyed our daily breakfast thanks to the great staff: Estelita, David, Mohammed, Andrea, Patricia, and Oussama. They were always very pleasant, friendly, efficient, and very hospitable. Our day always started on a wondereful note after an enjoyable breakfast even if it was pouring outside!",5,2023,03,21
115,Sarah & Pete Wedding,"We stayed March 17/18 2023 for our wedding. 
I have to say from the moment we stepped out of our taxi to the moment we left it was amazing. 
The staff of whom there were many that helped us were so polite and helpful above and beyond. 
A special thanks goes to Gregory who made our stay just special but sorting the room out for our wedding night. Thank you again was amazing. 
The lady ( I am sorry I can not remember her name ) in the Coral bar who looked after our friends and family again was just amazing and so helpful. 
I just cant thank you all enough for all you help and friendly ness. 
This hotel is a must stay. 
We will be back ( with less luggage 😂 )
Thank you all again
Sarah & Pete",5,2023,03,21
115,Wonderful stay in a lovely hotel ,"Stopped overnight  to go to the Royal Opera House and had a wonderful stay .  The staff were all really attentive and professional which made for a lovely experience. The Irish cocktails selection ‘Summer Blood’ and ‘Finnigans’  recommended in the coral room were amazing . We were upgraded to a king from a queen room , the interior of the hotel was lovely and the  bed very comfortable. The food generally was lovely - only  very small feedback would be we chose the pre theatre menu and went for ‘fried fillet of  haddock’ which was actually  fish and chips ie battered haddock served with chips. This was much too heavy for a pre theatre meal for us and not as expected.  ",5,2023,03,20
115,Return visitor...lovely hotel,"Such comfortable beds, and little extras in the room to make stay more special. Staff lovely. Easy to reach Covent Garden, highlights of Bloomsbury and near to underground. Have also stayed at a sister hotel in London, and love both. ",5,2023,03,17
115,Great central London hotel,"Comfy spacious room, great bars and atmosphere. Breakfast is a highlight with friendly service from Estelita and her team. Hotel is perfectly situated in a quiet street but right by Tottenham Court Road. Thoroughly enjoyed the stay and will be back",5,2023,03,16
115,LOVE this hotel every time!,"We really LOVE this hotel! The service is outstanding and memorable - friendly, helpful and professional with nothing too much trouble. The rooms are tastefully designed with lots of thoughtful details and finishing touches, and the bed gloriously comfortable.

Inspired cocktails in the Coral Room followed by a superbly cooked dinner in Dalloway Terrace and a night cap (or two!) in The Bloomsbury Bar made for a perfect evening without the need to step outside the hotel and into the pouring rain.

This hotel really ticks all the boxes - a great location that's surprisingly peaceful, a professional front of house team who lead with warm friendliness, and a hidden genius or two in the kitchen that can really cook up a delicious plate of food.",5,2023,03,14
115,Will definitely book again 5*,"This is the second time I have stayed at The Bloomsbury Hotel, and we are already planning a third! Such a fantastic location; just off Tottenham Court Road, super easy to get to the tube lines, onto Oxford street, walkable to the theatres. Rooms are stylish and clean, food is great! Special thank you to Ricardo in Guest Experiences. ",5,2023,03,13
115,Looking for luxury found average,"An average hotel, trying hard but falling down in some areas. Some untrained staff n Coral Bar who were unable to identify a well known brand of alcohol, he came back three times before announcing that the best known brand of Pastis from France was not available and infact no Pastis was available.

If I return to this establishment will I have to bring a bottle!!

The rest of the stay was fine, but the skill of running a first class establishment is ensuring everthing is fine, on this occasion it was not..",3,2023,03,13
115,Always Brilliant,"We’ve stayed at The Bloomsbury several times and it’s consistently brilliant. Architecturally beautiful with lovely rooms etc but as ever, it’s the people that really make it. And they do. Always cheerful, helpful and above all, on it. Couldn’t recommend it enough. A special thanks to Francisco and Zack in the bar downstairs and Patricia, Estelita, Tara and Mohammed in the restaurant too!",5,2023,03,12
115,A hidden gem.,"Hotel-keeping at its best. I loved this place and particularly the staff who ensure this is an exceedingly well oiled machine. Warm welcome as a Discovery member, upgrade, complimentary champagne and cheese plate. Great comfortable room with everything I could wish for. The staff at all levels were engaging and friendly. I did not eat except for breakfast which was very good, but will definitely try the restaurant next time…….there is definitely going to be a next time!",5,2023,03,09
115,Ryan did a good job but hotel over charged,hotel was overall good however they overcharged for room service £6.70 was taken  off Ryan who works as a waiter was a good and friendly  costs are to high for food. The hotel is well placed but they need to consider doing changes to breakfast room,3,2023,03,03
115,A gorgeous gem in the heart of London,"The Bloomsbury is the best hotel I’ve ever stayed in around London, absolutely gorgeous smell as soon you walk in, friendly and attentive staff -  from the front desk, concierge, doormen, cleaners.  Rooms are clean, cosy and modern. The whole ambience of the hotel is calm & relaxing with the added touch of luxury. The added touches didn’t go unnoticed. I feel this hotel suits a quiet relaxing stay if that’s what you want or a more vibrant and lively stay with the bars and restaurants on offer or a blend of both. They’ve achieved a perfect combination. I felt at such ease and found myself saying “oh that’s good” to everything, such as the ability to cast your phone to the tv so you can watch Netflix etc… water was lovely and hot. Robes lovely and soft. Comfortable beds and pillows. Didn’t hear any noise or disturbance through the night (or anytime) and I usually find with London hotels that you usually do. The location is perfect, around the corner from Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road station. We had room service one evening and it was divine. Cocktails beautiful. After a loss in the family, this was exactly the place we needed for some much needed R&R and away from the day to day. Myself & my mum stayed for 2 nights, we could have easily stayed for longer, in fact we’ve decided to make it our annual girly treat. Don’t hesitate book it, you will not be disappointed. Thank you to all at The Bloomsbury ",5,2023,03,01
115,THANKS TO THE HOTEL... AND GREGORY!,"This is a beautiful boutique-style hotel that is right in the middle of the action in London.  An easy walk to Theaters, Covent Garden and Tottenham Court Road/Oxford Street.

I had a bit of a drama while staying in London, as my mobile phone was stolen!  I would like to particularly mention Gregory - who was on Reception for the night shift.  He spent a lot of time with me, helping me to complete the online Police report.  He even called me the next morning to check I was ok... as it was my birthday!  Gregory's customer skills are excellent and he is a huge asset to the hotel.  Thanks Gregory!! ",4,2023,03,01
115,A Posh Stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel,"Staff at The Bloomsbury makes you feel to the Manor Born -- even if you're from one of the Former Colonies. They remember your name, and are supremely attentive, from the Concierge to the waiters in The Coral Room. Housekeeping was immaculate, and they made themselves as invisible as possible. The General Manager herself popped in to the Breakfast Room to introduce herself & ask how everything was.  I am a Vintage Lady traveling alone, and could not have felt more looked after.  It was an excellent stay, and I cannot recommend The Bloomsbury highly enough.",5,2023,02,28
115,50th birthday celebration,"This was our first visit to The Bloomsbury and most certainly will NOT be our last,  I really don't know where to start  this hotel was spotless and has a wonderful , welcoming feel to it.  We were greeted by concierge who were so helpful and efficient and then headed to reception where we were welcomed by Ricardo.  Such an easy check in , and he had thought of every detail to make our stay and my husband's 50th birthday a memorable one, Ricardo and staff could not do enough for us.  The lounge, Coral Room and our suite were exceptional,  food , staff and service amazing .I could have quite happily stayed in the hotel and not left .  Please do try and visit this hotel , I can quite safely say you will find it hard to beat the service and surroundings.  Here..the customer do quite simply come first and foremost in all that they do.  Thank you to all the staff at The Bloomsbury, and especially Ricardo in making this a wonderful weekend  break , we will always remember it,  and we will see you again soon !",5,2023,02,27
115,Terrific Service - Great Location,"Yet again the Bloomsbury comes up trumps.   Fantastic location 2minutes from Oxford Street for the shops and major attractions.   It’s the service which is outstanding.   The staff cannot do enough for you and they make you feel special.   We stayed in a Double King,  very large comfortable bed.   Coral Bar is popular with a good vibe for an aperitif before your evening meal.  Breakfast offers lots of choice of first rate food.   The full English was perfect.  Special shoutout for the catering team Piotr, Maria, David, Estilita, Patricia, Alejandra and Andrea.    Marcela The Duty Manager was very helpful with a free room upgrade!   We are regular visitors to London and will be booking The Bloomsbury  next time.",5,2023,02,26
115,Return to The Bloomsbury ,"Second visit to the The Bloomsbury, this time with the family & just as wonderful as our last recent visit. 
All staff are so professional and very friendly. 
The ambience throughout the whole hotel is relaxed, grandeur & you feel very 'at home' the moment you walk through the door.
Enjoyed delicious food in the stunning Coral Room & a few too many cocktails post theatre in The Bloomsbury Club,  fabulous atmosphere with incredible live Jazz.  Breakfast served in The Trellis room is excellent quality, lovely to have a choice of fresh buffet fayre & made to order. 
Have to mention that the beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in any hotel and rooms nice & quiet.
The Bloomsbury has quickly become a favourite hotel of mine & I've stayed at many of a similar standard in London and beyond.
Please keep doing it just like this The Bloomsbury 👌",5,2023,02,26
115,Very happy repeat visitor!,"I've stayed at the Bloomsbury dozens of times over the years and it's probably my favourite hotel.  I visit London usually about every couple of weeks, for work, and it's ideally located just a few minutes from the office; but I'd prefer to stay here even if it was more out of the way.  The rooms are really comfortable, with excellent beds and facilities, but what really makes the place is the staff.  They're all friendly, helpful and professional, and do their level best to make sure guests are comfortable and happy. 
Checkin and checkout are rapid and smooth affairs.  And every time I stay, Maria in the Trellis Room greets me like an old friend at breakfast.  All the staff at breakfast are excellent - one couldn't ask for more.  Service is friendly, efficient and unobtrusive, breakfast is delicious.   I don't tend to use more than room and breakfast, as I'm usually only there for one night at a time, but I'm sure all the other facilities are just as excellent.",5,2023,02,24
115,The personal touches add that little bit extra! ,"Special treat for a birthday weekend. Greeted on entrance and then reception was amazing. King room was fantastic and very relaxing.
The hotel is well presented and the staff are fantastic, as well as being a great location for central London. Tucked away from the main roads right by British Museum. 
The Coral Bar and Terrace restaurant also had great service. 
Breakfast in the morning was absolutely spot on. 
Highly recommended! ",5,2023,02,23
115,Overnight stay for birthday,"The hotel staff are very on point and accommodating. We did have an issue with the wrong room and theatre tickets not being paid for, however the staff did rectify the issues in a very accommodating manner straight away . Must recommend George and his team in the Coral bar who were very friendly and helpful. Overall the food was very good and rooms very clean and comfortable beds. Would certainly recommend and stay again .",4,2023,02,23
115,Outstanding stay,"Wow! Superb hotel that is furnished to a high standard. Staff cannot do enough for you. Food excellent. Received a room upgrade, free cocktails and macarons. Beautiful room.

115,Recommend,"Boutique hotel  in a great location. It’s a walking distance to the heart of London nightlife & theater district. Clean rooms, good housekeeping. Friendly staff. Several dining options available but didn’t try them as there are plenty of options in the area.",5,2023,02,18
115,Amazing place!!!,"Perfect location, next to the underground. Great hotel, friendly and helpfull  Staff. Big thank you going to Leonid from the bar. The customer service witch he provide it's on the high level. I was impressed. ",5,2023,02,14

115,Best of London Hotel Quality,"Another faultless stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel! Immaculate service as usual and the beds are the most comfortable of any hotel in London.

They all go consistently over and above to make it such a warm and welcoming place to stay! Thank you all again so much! ",5,2023,02,13
115,Staying at the Bloomsbury hotel with my kids was a pleasure,"I wanted to to take my kids to London for the first time and we stayed at the The Bloomsbury Hotel for 3 nights. We felt great there from the very start of being greeted in the warmest way. The hotel and room we were staying at were spacious, clean and well furnished. We had a great time there after walking around the city all day and enjoyed a delicious breakfast + a few drinks at the bar while my kids were enjoying their non-walking time at the fireplace room. Overall great and recommend it .The people working there were professional and very welcoming. From a few of the names I remember it was: Estelita, David, Andrea, David from the Coral bar",5,2023,02,09
115,Wonderful as Ever,"This was my fourth visit to the Bloomsbury Hotel and it was as wonderful as ever. It is so stylish, the coral bar and the Bloomsbury sitting room are the perfect places to meet with friends. But as always, what makes it really special are the brilliant staff. From the minute you enter the reception they make you feel at home. Francisco on the front door and Maria at breakfast make you feel like an old friend, nothing is too much trouble, and there are new stars this time too, Patricia in the breakfast restaurant with her radiant smile looked after us so well. It felt a warm place to be on a cold February day.",5,2023,02,08
115,Wonderful hotel experience! ,"Four friends who just spent two nights in this gorgeous hotel. I don’t normally write reviews but this hotel was excellent. Great location, so close to Covent Garden. Wonderful staff who all went out of their way to be helpful (Marta & Ivan & the Coral bar manager all get an extra special mention for the excellent service). Spotless rooms. Excellent food. We had pre booked dinner out one night in a local restaurant in Covent Garden and wished we hadn’t as the food was so good in the hotel. Would highly recommend this hotel.

Date of stay: February 2023

Room tip: Ask for a room on a higher floor on the Coral Bar side of the hotel. The Granola at breakfast is fab!
",5,2023,02,07
115,My new favourite London Hotel,"A fantastic weekend stay at The Bloomsbury. I have stayed in a number of London hotels of similar price range over the last 5 years whether it be business, pleasure or both and I must say this is my new favourite. This was a couples weekend and we made use of the outstanding Dalloway Terrace and both of the Coral Room and Bloomsbury Club Bar,  both of which are very unique in their own ways.  I would recommend pre-booking as they are very popular and rightly so!
The best part about the hotel is the staff, absolutely everybody made us feel like royalty, whether we turned up in our travelling comfort hoody and trainers, or suited and dressed up evening wear we were made to feel very special indeed. Special thanks to Ricardo who arranged our bookings and added some very nice touches for our stay and also special mention for the breakfast dining staff Estelita, Xaria and Dussama, remembering names, what we had previously where we sat,  what we were staying for, such lovely touches to make guests feel that little bit extra.  I am very impressed.
We had a small issue with our room minibar which malfunctioned and would not open, and WOW did the Bloomsbury make up for it, absolutely not an issue the staff went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed.
If I HAD to force any suggestions my only slight criticism would be that the In Room Technology could do with being updated, the bathroom TV was very difficult to use, the remote worked but rarely connected with the TV,  took a while to turn on and then could not turn off, and the main TV was very slow and not many channels worked. Like I said a very small suggestions and seemingly irrelevant criticism of a fantastic hotel.
I look forward to staying again when we next visit London, thank you all for making our weekend that extra bit special :) ",5,2023,01,31
115,Birthday celebrations at The Bloomsbury ,"My mum and I booked here after previously staying at The Kensington and The Marylebone.  This is another excellent hotel in The Doyle Collection brand.  The staff were accommodating and quick to resolve the initial double bed to twin bed issue we encountered.  Our room was comfortable and it was lovely to be greeted by champagne and macaroons, arranged by my Mum.  

My only slight disappointment was that the hotel had added this cost to my bill and presented it to me on check in, thus forcing my mum not only to tell me of the surprise, but also having to make me aware of the cost she would be paying. I do think this could have been dealt with better.  The greeting card also was also sadly not clear that it was a gift from my Mum.  The hotel had signed it from their own team, perhaps a shame given my Mum had bought it for £90.

That said everything else was very good!  A special shout out to their concierge team, who were lovely at all times and David (French gentleman) on the room service/housekeeping/breakfast team.  It was lovely to speak in French with him and he kindly obliged to opening our champagne when we were having trouble opening it.  The waiters, waitresses and Maitre d’hotel were also very good in The Coral Room, obliging to my chatting in Spanish.  We had a light lunch and evening drinks in there.  The table they reserved for us in the evening was lovely and we were made to feel wanted as guests of the hotel too.

Breakfast, as with all Doyle Collection hotels we have stayed at, was superb with a vast array of good quality continental and a la carte options.  The lady in charge was very efficient.  I was rather impressed that she had remembered my name as we left and wished us a pleasant day.

All in all a very good hotel, which we would undoubtedly recommend.

Tip: Book direct with the hotel for a free cocktail in The Coral Room and early check in (if available).",4,2023,01,30
115,Stylish and elegant boutique hotel,"This is a wonderful hotel. It is faultless. Fabulous staff from the quirkily dressed doorman to the charming receptionists, the helpful, friendly (and patient!) concierge. The room was super comfortable. The decor is stunning and it is embued with a warm ambience. Our entire stay was a pleasure from beginning to end.",5,2023,01,28
115,Perfect stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel.,"Second time at this wonderful hotel. From walking through the front door everything was just perfect.
We had a lovely room with the most comfortable bed ever.
The staff here go above and beyond they are friendly kind patient and very knowledgeable.
We had both drinks and food in the Coral Room which were lovely and the atmosphere perfect.
Dinner in the restaurant on the terrace was excellent and such a lovely vibe throughout.

Fantastic location with lots to do but you will probably find yourself wanting to spend your time in the bars and Restaurant within the hotel.
Downstairs is the Bloomsbury Club with great music  and again a lovely atmosphere. Such a lovely place to end the evening.
We really cannot find a nicer hotel that we have stayed in London.
You will not be disappointed if you choose The Bloomsbury.
We cannot wait to return.",5,2023,01,26
115,Fabulous hotel,"Fabulous hotel with the loveliest staff! Maria, Andrea, and Estelita were so nice and made our breakfast every morning a pleasure! The food was also delicious and the hotel catered very well to coeliac. Will definitely be back again!",5,2023,01,21
115,"Great location, stylish hotel","Loved our stay at The Bloomsbury. From the  comfortable big bed, the location , to the amazing large breakfast, it was just spot on. The place offers very stylish bars. 

Thank you so much for the warm welcome from Marcela and Emanuel. 
Thanks to smiley Ivan who looked after us and entertained our babyboy by the reception. 

Really recommend this hotel! ",5,2023,01,19
115,"What a lovely visit, so central and a beautiful place.","I had the perfect stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel, it is in the best location you can imagine for a London visit.
Anoushka and Zac were fantastic in the Jazz bar and took care of me and my friends very well.
Breakfast was delicious with great fresh options, the staff were friendly and welcoming and didn't mind at all when our baby spilt a jug of milk over the table and floor! Thanks Maria and Estelita for looking after us, and being so lovely to our baby.",5,2023,01,19
115,Lovely hotel with great staff,"I stayed  here with my daughter for her 21st birthday.
The Bloomsbury is a mix betweem hogh spec classy and still with a casual approach. So no stiff upperlip i loved the bar at the Coral Room ( great cocktails) and the basement bar with live music. Great barstaff!
Breakfast was lovely,i was greated by my name every morning by the lovely staff.
The queen bed room was not very big but had everything you needed. The room was heated at 22 centigrade which was far to hot to my taste ( i‘m dutch we sleep in cold bedrooms) but after asking they made sure i could „cool“ my room to 16 centigrade.
Its near to Covent Garden and Soho and next to a tube starion.
You do pay a fair amount for the stay but they do live up to the expectations.
I loved it!
I felt very welcome! 
Thank you!",5,2023,01,18
115,Relaxed Comfort,"Very much enjoyed a weekend stay prior to a Monday business meeting. The international staff put the accents on an excellent weekend. I particularly enjoyed the breakfast, which offers a nice combination of buffet and a la carte items that will appeal to North American, continental and Scandinavian types. Kudos to Estlita, Maria and Andrea on that front.",5,2023,01,16
115,Great Hospitality,"My husband and i stayed here for our wedding anniversary, hospitality has been fantastic from start to finish, very attentive and welcoming. The rooms are beautifully decorated, and have a cosy feel.

115,Home away from home,"We had another fantastic stay at The Bloomsbury. With the Elizabeth Line now operating straight through to Tottenham Court Road, getting from Heathrow couldn't be easier or faster. 
The team couldn't do more for us, breakfast was great. The breakfast room has been refurbished and is so much brighter and a lovely place now to enjoy a longer breakfast. We also had some drinks in the Coral Room. The service and options on the menu too were fantastic. They've a lovely signature cocktail menu based on Irish counties and beautifully compiled in a book. 
The Bloomsbury Club Bar had live music - and we actually got a table in the outside part of the bar, cosy and warm like a proper speakeasy bar. 
The front of house and concierge teams were also phenomenal, always a welcome back and a helping hand. 
Can't wait to come back. Thanks to everyone there.",5,2023,01,14
115,Great hotel and staff,"We had a wonderful time at the Bloomsbury hotel.
The hotel is absolutely well located at the heart of London and at a walking distance of many importance tourist locations. The food was great and the facilities very comfortable, what you could expect from a hotel of this category. The best part was the staff. They were lovely and professional.

The Warmest of Welcomes and what a Service. I called to reserve a table at the Dalloway terrace, a complimentary drink on arrival was the nicest of touches and service was beyond exceptional.

Breakfast lovely ladies were also very friendly and professional.
Whole experience was fanastic.",5,2023,01,04

Thanks for a great stay and we look forward to come again!",5,2023,01,04
115,Perfect Location Comfortable Hotel,Perfect location to hit the sales...although I'm not much of a shopper.  The hotel is beautiful and relaxing whilst the Coral room is buzzing in the evening- perfect for our 20something daughters who came to visit.  George in the Coral room was outstanding not just looking after us over cocktails but even making a light camomile tea for my wife before we retired for the night. Maria and her team were excellent at breakfast as was Marcella at check in. Overall a very pleasant stay and we hope to return soonish.,5,2023,01,03

115,Top of the class yet again,"I decided to return to The Bloomsbury for another stay and I can 100% say that the staff are still second to none! A few fresh faces but all smiley and more than willing to help, Ivan the concierge was charming, helpful and incredibly knowledgeable about any and every question I had, Marcela at the front desk even remembered me from my previous stay! check in was quick and efficient and I even managed to squeeze in a quick bite before heading out on my day. On check out Emanuel went the extra mile and a taxi waiting to whisk me away, my only regret is not being able to stay longer! 
will definitely be back!",5,2022,12,31
115,The Bloomsbury is the perfect hotel ,"The hotel is beautifully appointed, central to a lot of activities, ranging from the British museum to the theater district, and attended by a very attentive staff.

We are looking forward to our next visit there soon :-)",5,2022,12,31
115,Lovely stay,"Our visit was amazing, from the door until leaving the hotel Marcela took care of us on every step and helped us with anything we needed. The drinks at the Coral Room were just delicious. Definitely worth a visit",5,2022,12,30
115,Amazing location and service,"Loved our visit there. Hotel is beautiful and has a great location. The service was wonderful, especially Marcela who took great care of us. Drinks at the Coral Room were delicious. I would definitely recommend.",5,2022,12,30
115,A brilliant stay!,"A special thanks to Marcela who pulled out all the stops to make our anniversary extra special. 

Due to rail strikes, we travelled by car and parked at The Imperial Hotel, which has a secure underground car park (£20 for 24hrs FYI). Only 10 minutes walk to the hotel, part of it walking along the gates of the British Museum. 

We had a lovely greeting on arrival from Marcela and received a complimentary upgrade to a suite for the evening. The suite is beautifully designed with a good-sized sized bathroom, separate cloakroom and all the amenities that one could need for their stay. We were situated on the 7th floor, pair this with edge to edge blackout blinds, we were able to have a very restful sleep. 

Before heading out for the evening, we enjoyed complimentary cocktails in The Coral Room. The 'Fools and Horses' being a favourite of ours! This was our second experience enjoying cocktails at the bar and it was great fun talking to the highly skilled and knowledgeable bartenders.

For when we returned, Marcela kindly booked us a table in The Bloomsbury Club to enjoy the late night jazz. We were seated in a cosy spot of the room with 2 glasses of fizz brought over, courtesy of the club. 

5* to The Bloomsbury and all the team. We thought our first stay was a brilliant one but this time it surpassed our expectations.  We look forward to staying again. Thank you so much.",5,2022,12,29
115,Great! - my go to when in London,"This was probably my forth time staying at The Bloomsbury hotel, I am a big fan and it's my go to when in London. The welcome was warm and efficient - and a lovely surprise to have been upgraded. The room was ready on time, faultlessly clean, huge very comfortable bed and lovely bathroom with great complimentary products.

It was a lovely touch to receive a little box of mini stollen as I was staying in the run up to Christmas, and a voucher for a glass of English sparkling wine in the bar. We ate in the Coral Room bar - lovely food and friendly and efficient service. We experienced the same great service and lovely food at breakfast too. There's always a nice vibe in the Coral Room, nicely designed seating areas, background music, attentive but not over fussy service.

I love the interiors generally in the hotel, the lounge is a nice nod to the what I imagine the style of the hotel would have been in the 30s, cosy with a real fire. Love the original staircase. The public areas are really well maintained - and it's great to see fresh flowers everywhere.

My only criticism is that the coffee at breakfast was a bit lukewarm....that's it!

Well done to the team from the manager down - congratulations on a wonderful hotel, and in particular great service from the team - and that can be the trickiest part to get right!

Looking forward to my next stay already.",5,2022,12,27
115,Like home,"My family and I stayed at The Bloomsbury and it was incredible! Special thanks to Emanuel and Ivan who made our stay more enjoyable, and to all the team who took care of us throughout the whole stay! We’ll come back for sure.",5,2022,12,27
115,First stay at this hotel,"My recent stay was short for business.  It personally checked all the boxes for my trip.  I also wanted to mention all the staff during my breakfast visit.

Estelita, Andrea, Omar and team were great.  Provided excellent customer service and answered my questions during my breakfast dine in.  Thank you tita!  

I would highly recommend them if you just wanted to get some fuel for your day around London.

Overall stay was good, centrally located, close to near by shopping and food options.   Other than a random decorative pillow having a blood stain upon my arrival.  But I threw the pillow to the ground none the less.

I would recommend this place for business travels. Cheers!",4,2022,12,20
115,Great breakfast,"We just had an excellent weekend stay at the Bloomsbury. The team was very friendly throughout. Special thank to the ladies running the breakfast in the beautiful Trellis room. The buffet was very diverse and the a la carte menu dishes were delicious. A good start of the day.

115,I love this hotel,"I am a regular and come for business and pleasure. I find the staff and their care is what makes this a 5* business. Alejandra, Suhaina and Shardanay cannot do enough on front desk. Always polite, attentive and kind- what you might expect from v high end hotels. Very impressive and also consistent. I love Anna at breakfast who is thoughtful, kind and remembers details about you to make you feel its tailored service. I love this hotel. It’s great for business and special occasion. Ricardo is amazing at arranging all my bookings and the fact I know their names well details the personal level of service. You aren’t a number at this hotel but care is taken to appreciate you as an individual. Everyone knows your name and care is taken to make sure you are comfortable.",5,2022,12,14
115,Wedding anniversary trip,"We had the most perfect stay at the Bloomsbury yet again, it really is the most wonderful hotel. From the moment you walk up the beautifully decorated entrance and are greeted by the divine smell, every little detail is superb. Even though we’ve been before it still feels really special and a real treat. Special thanks must go to the GM Emanuel, who looked after us all so well and treated my Parents to complimentary cocktails as a wedding anniversary present which was so thoughtful. He gave them the most beautiful room too and it was hugely appreciated by us, we felt very spoilt! All the other staff are also so friendly (especially one of the managers in the Coral Bar whose name sadly I can’t remember). It’s a joy to stay here and I can’t wait to return!",5,2022,12,14
115,"Great spot, 15 mins walk to Covent Garden.","All round great. From check in to breakfast. From bar to in room dining. Crème brûlée is on point and burger perfect.

Their terras is nice for dinner. Bar is lively.",5,2022,12,13
115,Outstanding Service,"Ive stayed here for work many times. I come back because of its location, its boutique size and feel, yet with great amenities. A gym, a lovely bar, a terrace restaurant, and a breakfast thats cooked and served to you as it should be. The service is what elevates it. They open the door. They know your name, they make sure you have everything you need. The rooms are clean, well decorated, with great views. Its the perfect little London Hotel and it beats the bigger ones hands down. Maria and the Breakfast staff are great and the management are polite and efficient with guests and their well drilled staff. None of the grab and go nonsense. Its polite and easy. love the place. I wouldn’t stay anywhere else.",5,2022,12,13
115,"Weekend in London, December '22","Me and my husband spent the weekend in London had a great time at the Bloomsbury. The check in was smooth and quick even though the hotel was busy. The room was very clean and nicely decorated, with lots of personal touches. The service from the restaurant & bar was fantastic and the food extremely good. The location is absolutely perfect as you can easily walk around London or get the tube/bus to move around. Highly recommended!",5,2022,12,12
115,Best hotel in London,"Been coming to this hotel for a decade. I can’t give it a higher rating. The hotel itself is gorgeous but what sets it apart from every hotel I’ve ever stayed at has to be the staff. Everyone - and I mean everyone - from Maria and Estrelita and the entire breakfast team; Brian, Ivan and the concierge team to George and his bar team…Marta and Suzanne run an incredible ship. It’s no exaggeration to say it’s genuinely a home away from home. Here’s to another decade.",5,2022,12,09
115,Business Meeting & evening event ,"We held our company offsite meetings in the Queen Mary Hall and George V Hall earlier this week, which were lovely in size and bright with natural light! The ambience for our day and evening event was lovely due to all the Christmas decorations and trees!

Huge appreciation to the ops staff, nothing was too much trouble and everyone was extremely courteous and professional including  George, Florin, Cosmin & Huseyin... a huge credit to the Doyle Group!",5,2022,12,08

Location - brilliant. Central Close to everything and great access to tube etc.
The Hotel - just stunning as soon as you walk in the welcoming door man greets you assists you with cases and you are hut by a gorgeous spa like smell that seems to flow around the hotel. Sitting room beautiful with a real fire very warm, snug and welcoming. Mulled wine and chocolate available while waiting to check in. Reception staff lovely and helpful. Rooms beautiful, very comfy beds and stocked with everything you need and more.
Breakfast - brilliant 
The coral room - we had a light lunch in here and then drink the following two days. It was great. It gets very busy but staff nice and helpful.
We will 100% be back.",5,2022,12,05
115,Class Hotel operated by a Class Team,"My wife and I stayed here again for a quick visit to London. The service, facilities and location never fails to impress. The welcome from Victor and the team at reception as well as the exceptional service from Maria, Estorita and the team at breakfast is the best we have experienced anywhere. This is a class hotel operated by a class team.",5,2022,12,04
115,"Great location, friendly staff and a great stay","We arrived at the hotel on foot from the tube station a short walk away and immediately a doorman came to take our bags from us and showed us to reception to check in. We were a little early but our room was ready and we were asked if we needed help with taking our bags up to the room.
The room itself was perhaps a little smaller than expected but had everything we needed for a comfortable stay and the bathroom was very nice and the bedroom and bathroom were spotlessly clean.
We had some lunch and drinks in the Coral Room which was a really bright room with a good atmosphere. All of the waiters and staff here were very welcoming and helpful and attentive. 
Every time we left or returned to the hotel all of the staff were extremely friendly and polite and went out of their way to advise of places to visit whilst we were in London.
We would definitely return to this lovely, welcoming, friendly hotel on our next visit to London.",5,2022,11,28
115,"Outstanding service, comfort, convenience, and value","Family has just returned from 5 day trip to the beautiful city of London. The Bloomsbury was our home base, and it was perfect.  Easy access to sites, food, transportation; Elegant service done with a personable, proficient, and professional manner - from the front desk and Concierge, to our daily breakfasts from Maria and her excellent staff, to the bartenders at this wonderful Coral Room.   All appointments in the room were top notch.",5,2022,11,27
115,Perfect Hideaway from the chaos of The West End.,"Superb breakfast overseen by Estelita and Maria. 
The new General Manager, Susanne has maintained a high level of luxury while improving the small, significant details which set this hotel apart from similar rivals which lack the personal touch. 
As regular visitors to London we occasionally attend functions which are too distant from The Bloomsbury for convenience and we have to use a similar hotel. This is when we realise how lucky we are to have. discovered’ it. 
The quality and attention to detail is what brings us back time and time again. 
Sadly, some of the stalwarts from the staff have moved on to pastures new but the Coral Room is still under the safe hands of Gio and Georgie. It’s easily the best cocktail bar in central London. 
Hint: If you’re peckish in the afternoon but don’t want a full Afternoon Tea order the fabulous English scones with clotted cream and jam in the Coral Room. Truly gorgeous!",5,2022,11,27
115,Magical!,We had the most amazing dinner in the Dalloway Terrace. Magical atmosphere and environment. The Black cod with miso was delicious. Elena who served our table was a joy! We will definitely be back! Truly 5 star,5,2022,11,26

115,Great choice in the theatre district!,"Delightful hotel in a very busy area of London.  I enjoyed the welcoming attitude of the staff, the delicious food and the small touches that make all of the difference for guests.

I look forward to staying again and again.",5,2022,11,25
115,Amazing dinner in the Enchanted Forest!,"My partner and I went to Dalloway for dinner for my birthday and I couldn't have been happier. From the moment we arrived, Shakira took care of us from beginning to end. We also had a little note on the table wishing me happy birthday. A lovely personal touch. Alejandro the floor manager came to introduce himself and was looking after us as well, making sure we were having a great time. He is so professional and kind. The food was great and drink outstanding. We will definitely be back. We loved it.",5,2022,11,25
115,Superb hotel!,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury in November 2022 and had a wonderful experience! This hotel is superb!

First of all, yes, the location is great (central London and access to the Tube closeby, allowing to travel the city efficiently) and the hotel is extremely charming - from the fireplace at the reception to the stylish interior of the rooms (also, and this may sound a bit weird, but the hotel even smells extremely good!)

However, what made our stay truly unforgettable is the staff! A special thanks to Emmanuel, who went over and beyond: He is extremely forthcoming and has a great sense for detail, surprising us with some Champagne to celebrate our anniversary! Thank you!

In short: I would highly recommend to stay at the Bloomsbury and we will certainly return!",5,2022,11,22
115,Usual great service...,"I have been going to this hotel for close to 20 years! There is a reason I keep going back as it has always been an enjoyable stay and in more recent times some of it has been renovated with a new bar which used to be the old entrance way. I particularly thought Alejandra and Shardonay were really helpful on reception but all the staff, some of whom have been there for a number of years are all very professional in my view. Really just good old fashioned service...thanks...Paul",5,2022,11,16

115,Birthday Cocktails Amazing!,"Went for birthday drinks as a little treat. We sat outside in a little nook, it was warm with the heaters on and felt very magical with all the fairy lights. They were playing live jazz music inside.  Zac our waiter was brilliant not only in his interaction but also at suggesting cocktails according to our preferences. He also managed to remember all our names with accurate pronunciations. We tested him at the end of the night and amazingly he got all our names right. It's a lovely venue, delicious cocktails, great atmosphere and hosted perfectly.",5,2022,11,07

The people at the Front Desk, the wait-staff at the restaurants and bar,  and the housekeeping staff all provide five-star service!   We will definately stay here again on our next trip to London!",5,2022,11,05
115,"Great service, food and wine","I love this place, the bar has a great vibe and serves fabulous drinks. But a shout out to the terrace, I had dinner here again this evening which in itself was fabulous, black cod with hazelnut beans followed by a selection of cheese, all accompanied by wonderful champagne and wines. I was very well looked after as a lone business traveller by Madelina. I would very happily recommend a visit if you find yourself in Bloomsbury.",5,2022,10,31
115,Home from Home - The Most Perfect Stay,"We have just checked out of room 528 at the wonderful Bloomsbury hotel. We stayed here for 3 glorious nights and all I can say is thank you. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for a truly magical stay. The hotel itself is breathtakingly beautiful, stylish and elegant and a real gem in the centre of London. However, I have to say it really is the fantastic staff at the Bloomsbury that make this place so special. 

From the moment we arrived we were greeted not just as guests but as friends. The concierge was more than helpful and offered to take our bags while we explored the city. I am sorry I didn’t get the names of both concierges we met while we were here, but both gentleman were absolutely fantastic. 

Big shout out to Andrea and Estella in breakfast who made every morning enjoyable. Both have exceptional service and were more than helpful. The food was delicious and there was so much to choose from. Also a massive thank you to George too in the Coral Room bar. He was just exceptional. 

Finally, our room was spacious, stylish and spotlessly clean. The espresso machine in the room was also a great amenity to have. I really wish I could write a review on every single aspect of our trip and every person we met at The Bloomsbury. But thank you to everybody. We cannot wait to return sometime really really soon ! ! !",5,2022,10,31

The hotel has a classy vibrant atmosphere and is in a great location. Thanks to Marcela for handling any queries we had also. We will definitely be back next year ,5,2022,10,31
115,AVOID TOP FLOOR ROOMS,"Had a lovely stay here 7th & 8th October. We had a room on the 7th floor where there are eves and sloppy ceilings. Sadly on the first night I banged my head on one of the sloppy corners which was on my side of the bed. Therefore I asked the hotel if they could move us or even give us a ‘put up’ bed to avoid using that side of the bed. They were unable to move us so gave us a put up bed…..and a free cocktail in one of their bars. Of course not ideal when paying over £300 a night but as it was only for one night I made do. The beds are very very small too. Breakfast is the star of the show here! Maria and Estelita are truly archetypal maitre dees…..welcoming, friendly and going the extra mile to make you feel special. Sadly this is quite rare now, especially in London where you are usually treated like a number. And Ana who served us on our first morning is brilliant……certainly she knows what service  should be!! Sadly on the second morning she was on room service and wasn’t around but the other staff members were good too. Would stay here again but not on the top floor where the ceilings are sloppy.

Bar was amazing
the way the Staff treats you makes you feel home.",5,2022,10,12
115,Fabulous in Every Way,"We just spent a week at the Bloomsbury and it exceeded our expectations for warmth, coziness, convenience, sophistication, and hospitality. Just around the corner from all the city's action, this was a welcome retreat and departure point for all explorations. What took the stay from great to memorable was Brian, our concierge. For months before my arrival to the very last cab ride, Brian was our man-on-the-spot in London, counseling us on restaurants, sights, and shopping. I don't think I will ever be a fan of British food, but I do recommend listening to Brian's dining advice. 

My sister is planning a holiday trip in a couple of months, and I am urging her to stay at the Bloomsbury for all of the above reasons and so that she and Brian can begin planning.

I'm sure we will be back.",5,2022,10,09
115,a little gem,"perfect location for our  meeting. Everything was perfect, meeting rooms were excellent, large with natural daylight, staff was great, reactive and very friendly, food was very good, location was ideal, tube station very close. service was quick at dinner.

Rooms very nice and clean.

great recommendations from the concierge for restaurants etc.

everything was absolutely perfect. A little gem and would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,10,07
115,A lovely welcoming helpful hotel,We stayed here with our son and were welcomed by wonderful helpful staff. Nothing was too much effort and the room was welcoming and cosy! A wonderful fruit bowl and biscuits selection as an added extra. Bathroom was dated but that’s my only complaint. Taxis were ordered for us and concierge were incredible here and at their sister hotel!,4,2022,10,03
115,Another perfect stay at my London pied-a-terre,"I have now lost count of the number of stays here, and each time it is wonderful.  Not just for the elegant comfort, but the superb staff - whose genuine welcome and effort to make things great, I so appreciate.   

I am slowly learning the names of those lovely people: Marcela, Marta, Emanuel and Sebastian at Reception, Maria, Plamena and Estelita in the breakfast room; Brian, Francisco and Ivan on the door, and I don't want to guess and I don't have time right now to call the hotel to check the others, but basically everyone. 

My only worry is that each time, the stay is so flawless, can it possibly be as good the next time?  So far, it has been, or even better.",5,2022,09,30
115,Good service,"We stayed at The Bloomsbury for 3 nights. We were a group of 7 women and had booked 4 rooms. 3 of the rooms were fine, but the last room was not as expected.  We made a complaint, and everything was sorted in a very pleasant manner. We got an upgrade, and we were well taken cared of. Sebastian made sure we had an excellent stay. What a nice, polite and professional person. The breakfast was also wonderful. We will come back, not only because of the central location and the lovely hotel, but because some members of the staff made sure we had a stay that was a little bit extra. Thank you!",5,2022,09,30
115,Absolutely Perfect,"I could not have had a more lovely stay. The staff was gracious enough to upgrade me to a king room upon arrival, and they continued to provide the absolute best of service. Everyone I encountered was friendly and willing to help the lost American. The bed was heaven and the room was lovely. Breakfast was a beautiful start to the day. I especially enjoyed dessert on the gorgeous  Dalloway Terrace at the end of a busy day sightseeing.",5,2022,09,30
115,Lovely stay,"The coral room has a lovely decor, and the whole cocktail experience was presented beautifully.

The whole place feels like a lovely hideaway while being so close to the main road, and definitely has a bit more character than some chain hotels.

Do go to the basement bar if you visit as well!",5,2022,09,28
115,Even the Black pudding was Great!,"Always wanted to stay at The Bloomsbury and after booking to see a theatre show locally to the hotel, the opportunity presented itself.

The concierge team were top class and after going for a FREE courtesy walk with the lovely Susie (every Saturday morning from at 11:00a.m i'm told), re the history of the local area, we had a drink in the beautiful Coral Room.

The staff were ALL friendly, helpful and keen to make our stay a memorable one. I mean this in a normal way, not pretentious or patronising. I even commented to my wife that i wonder if this is how celebrities are treated when they visit hotels!

We ate at the Dalloway Terrace after our theatre show and enjoyed a very pleasant dinner is a very beautiful setting, followed by a few drinks in the Coral Rooms.

A special shout out to Estelita, Maria and Patricia at breakfast where i couldn't believe how nice the Black Pudding was. I should get out more!

My wife and i will be back, and thanks so much for looking after us.",5,2022,09,26
115,Our last visit,"The Bloomsbury is without doubt one of the best hotels I have stayed in. All the staff there were excellent from the man who helped us when we arrived through reception, the restaurants and the Coral Room. everyone there went out of their way to ensure that guests have the best possible experience.

The Coral Room is a great place to enjoy bother dinner drinks and post dinner drinks.
Guests are placed appropriately within the room depending upon such factors as the size of the party etc. and this works very well. 

Dinner on the Dalloway Terrance has to be recommended the service is first class and the food and wines were excellent.

Breakfast in the Breakfast Room is also well worthwhile. The range of breakfast foods available is beyond compare and again the staff there cannot do enough to help their guests.

Rooms are very comfortable and quiet.

I cannot wait to make my next visit there.",5,2022,09,26
115,Fantastic Trip,I have found that all The Doyle Collection of Hotels are a wonderful experience - attention to details and a wonderful staff - always concerned for your well being and ensure you have a wonderful stay.,5,2022,09,25
115,Excellent,"A lovely hotel in a prime location with the best breakfast in London served by the best team. Estelita, Maria and the team went out of their way to look after us. Nothing was too much trouble and they made us very welcome. So friendly and personable. Thank you Estelita and Maria for looking after us so well! Looking forward to seeing you again soon hopefully!",5,2022,09,25
115,Great team!,"Started in the hotel for a meeting. The hotel is great and the rooms are super comfy. 
Hotel team is amazing, from the reception to engineering, with a special mention to Housekeeping and the legendary Ana and the breakfast team (Estelita, María, Andrea and Ana). 
Hope I can go back soon!",5,2022,09,25
115,For me it is the best hotel in London!,"I've been visiting this hotel since it was a Jury's hotel and it keeps it high standarfs since then.
It is a boutique hotel and although I've preffered the former reception and entrance, service is still top notch! Location is the best in London! Maria at breakfast is great and all other staff at reception, porter etc.
We will be back as always!",5,2022,09,24
115,Fantastic Staff,"It was my first time staying at The Bloomsbury and it exceeded my expectations. The chic Art Deco Bloomsbury circle decor was so stylish, the rooms very comfortable and quiet and the food excellent but what really made the hotel stand out for me was the fantastic staff. I was on my own but they made me feel so welcome. They were all so smiley and helpful but two people in particular deserve special mention - Anna at breakfast and Francisco who helped me with my luggage. They were so friendly and made me feel really at home. I will definitely be back.",5,2022,09,23
115,Bad service,"We decided to stay an extra night in London and wanted to move from our hotel called middle eight to the bloomsbury just to try something new - although we were very happy at middle eight. The service from the get go was nothing compared to our previous hotel. We arrived early and the receptionist told us the room is usually available at 3pm but she would be able to get us the room earlier. She would make sure our luggage would be in the room when we got the key later on. Moreover, she said she would call us when it was ready. She never called so we ended up calling them instead (around 2pm), she said the room would be ready in 20 mins so we headed back. We ended up waiting until 3pm for our room after all. The communication by the receptionists was really bad. If we knew that it would take longer we would just walk around and shop a bit more. When we asked around 2.45pm, she told us the room was ready but she would be helping us in 2 mins as she was running to get something. When she came back she actually ended up helping someone else and it took her about 10-15 more minutes before we got our key. Once we got the key we got no explanation of the hotel facilities e.g. the restaurant/breakfast/bars - although we heard other guests received this info. She just kind of shoved the key in our face and then left. Very disappointing and not professional at all. We never received any apology from the staff despite the mistakes and miscommunication from their side. When we finally arrived to the room they forgot to bring the luggage. We had to call them for it. We mentioned that we had waited for awhile and our luggage wasn’t even in the room - the lady on the phone just said ok will send them up and then just hung up. No apology. Hotels are all about the service. For the price of this hotel, we expected much better. There are so many other hotels in London to choose from. We won’t be back.",2,2022,09,22
115,Another great stay!,"I stayed at the Bloomsbury for 9 nights and the hotel was great. A very location, fantastic bars in the hotel and super friendly and helpful staff. A special shout out to the breakfast team, thanks to Patricia, Piotr, Lazlo, Estelita-Maria, Ana and Andrea-Oussama",4,2022,09,21
115,The Bloomsbury Club Bar - always one of my favourites!,"I've been enjoying the Bloomsbury Club Bar for years now and I decided to take a friend of mine for a drink. Last time I visited I had to order a classic cocktail as the signature drinks menu was unavailable, which made my experience a little less memorable as I was with a visiting friend. Although this time the menu was still not fully available, I managed to enjoy a Mad Monkey and my guest an Old Fashioned that, in his opinion, was among the best he's ever had! Service was EXCEPTIONAL and the guys were super kind with us!",5,2022,09,20
115,"Great stay, wonderful staff","We had a wonderful London visit, staying at this beautiful and well located hotel. Staff was accommodating and very hospitable. Thank you for the nice welcome at the reception by Ricardo, Roxane, and Marcela, considering that travelling with kids can never happen without trouble, they made it much easier for me.",5,2022,09,19
115,A wonderful experience,"The hotel is situated in a fantastic location; which is perfect for reaching nearby attractions, shopping, restaurants and west end shows. All of the rooms contain luxury amenities including marble bathrooms, Nespresso machines, soft bed linen and towels. I recently stayed in the king suite (pictures attached) which was stunning. The Coral room bar is a beautiful space which serves a selection of delicious cocktails. The staff at The Bloomsbury are incredibly attentive and friendly, especially Marcella on the front desk. I highly recommend staying at The Bloomsbury.",5,2022,09,18
115,Great place & really friendly service,"Went for a couple of drinks and had a lovely time. Quiet, chilled out place with really nice decor. The waiter, Zac, was really friendly, had a great sense of humour and was super attentive!

Overall pretty cool place and everyone was really nice!",5,2022,09,17
115,"Great service, great vibes!","My friends and I had such a great time at the Bloomsbury club: the ambience was great, the drinks were great and above all the staff were incredible. Shout out to Zac who made us all feel welcome and gave us a helping hand in deciding what to pick!",5,2022,09,17
115,A warm stay away from home in the very heart of London.,"Service is what I like most about this hotel. It’s warm and friendly, attentive with an attention to detail that feels genuine. For example, when  we asked for extra pods of coffee in our room, housekeeping clearly remembered it and every day we had extra pods. In the restaurant breakfast service could not be warmer. Maria and  Patricia (they’re lovely!!), Oussama and the team make you feel at home.  Greetings are personal by name with little touches of interest that feel more like a family run hotel. 
Rooms aren’t capacious but you’re in central London. You’re 5min walk from Tottenham Court underground.  Well appointed, comfy with spot on room amenities.
On the down side, breakfast ain’t cheap if it isn’t in the room package but it is delicious and well made. The air con is also annoyingly set to go off every few hours which isn’t great when you wake up sweaty and need to get out of bed to switch it back on. Concierge said they’d solve it but it clearly isn’t possible. The excuse for this is “ecological” but I think is wrongly placed. There are other places to green up.",4,2022,09,16
115,Great hotel and amazing staff!,"I was there for a work trip and the hotel is lovely, very British! The staff was great, Alejandra was a fantastic hostess and she accommodated all my requests! The hotel is charming and really well located, close to SOHO.",5,2022,09,15
115,"Exemplary service, Lovely staff, Great Experience","We hosted an event in the beautiful George V room and the service can't be faulted. Food was delicious and everything ran smoothly. My water never went empty or my needs unattended thanks to Samir, Cosmin and the rest of the team.",5,2022,09,14
115,Brilliant Bloosmbury,Brilliant hotel nothing to much trouble. The Coral Bar is excellent really nice atmosphere apparently its the third most visited cocktail bar in London! The Jazz bar is also excellent to. Breakfast was to a very good  standard. What makes this hotel stand out for sure are the staff especially IVAN the concierge he is a real asset to the hotel.  Its very central and in a super location. We stayed in room 612 and it had all the amenities you would expect. I would highly recommend a stay here and we will certainly be revisiting next time we are in London.,5,2022,09,13
115,Great hotel close to theatreland with professional welcoming staff,"Really enjoyed this hotel, booked via Mr & Mrs Smith - this came with a room upgrade (subject to availability - not available as fully booked!) and a free cocktail each in the Coral Bar. The latter was very busy when we arrived but it was a Saturday. The downstairs Bloomsbury bar was great and we sat 'outside' in a very atmospheric area. Drinks average price for London - ie expensive! Service good and staff were very welcoming - especially the door staff! The room we had was small but had every amenity you could imagine, very clean and super comfy bed. Great linen, big fluffy towels, Nespresso coffee machine, tea, coffee of many varieties and a turn down service.",5,2022,09,12
115,Exemplary,"Everything about the Bloomsbury is first class. The staff, the food, the accomodation, the facilities. There isn't a single thing you can improve. It's by far one of the best hotels in London and I can't wait to return.b",5,2022,09,09
115,"Great hotel, great people, great location - perfect stay!","﻿I stayed at ‚The Bloomsbury’ with my 5 year old daughter. We had fantastic days. The hotel is great - great location, great staff, great interior.

Our room - the Luxury Studio Suite - was big and beautiful. My daughter was over the moon. With special toys for her. :-) 

The breakfast is also highly recommended. You can choose between buffet and a la carte. There is everything your heart desires. The quality is great. And the service too - especially Maria in the breakfast room is very ‚on the ball‘! Thank you! But all other staff are extremely friendly, too.

And last but not least: dinner at the beautiful Dalloway Terrace is a must, too! Great food and atmosphere!

All in all perfect for a stay in London!",5,2022,09,09
115,An amazing weekend away,"Everything was perfect from the greeting at the door to the check out two days later. The breakfast was excellent with a varied choice, beautifully presented and a very friendly staff.
The room is not cheap but I have stayed in more expensive hotel and got a lot less. The staff is incredible, the hotel is super clean and the decor is amazing.
It is very well located so that you can walk to a lot of places but also 2 min from a tube station. As it is on a side street it is quiet.
I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel fully.",5,2022,09,08
115,Amazing hotel and exceptional service,"I have been a business customer since March. This hotel has been the most accommodating and exceptional service hotel I have had in London. Doyle collection hotels are beautifully styled. Ricardo has always dealt with my reservations seemlessly. Marta the deputy manager is both warm and has an old school welcoming approach to hospitality which is warm, kind and makes you feel at home. The other deputy managers Marcela and another Marta are also great.

The cateering team are simply the best. They accommodated every whim of my parents when I stayed with my mother. Maria, Estelita and especially Ana are wonderful, professional and warm. 

I have become a regular at this hotel and can as you can see they get to know you as a person not just a random customer. It’s great for both professional and personal stays. The food is great and I love the bars for both work and parties. The drinks are strong and well mixed. 

I couldn’t recommend the hotel enough.

Simran",5,2022,09,06
115,Fantastic experience at a magnificent hotel,"I have just returned from a weekend stay in London with my mum. Our time at the Bloomsbury was immensely enjoyable from beginning to end. All of the staff were so friendly and extremely helpful. I was made to feel like a guest of honour! The beds were very comfortable and rooms beautifully furnished. Breakfast in the morning was a true delight - everything was delicious and the service was most efficient.

I hope to return for another stay at this magnificent hotel in December.",5,2022,09,05
115,Mixed feelings,"I have mixed feelings about the hotel. In its favour it is in an excellent location, the decor is to a high standard, the staff helpful and the breakfast is of high quality.

On the other hand the bedrooms are small and over furnished . Marta the deputy manager  kindly upgraded  us to a larger room following an uncomfortable night suffering the sound of garbage trucks at 6 am.  However even in the larger room the internet was poor and sometimes cut out completely. The room was not cleaned until late afternoon following some prompting by ourselves.

Service in the lounge was not acceptable. We had guests and ordered tea and biscuits.  Ten thirsty minutes later we were advised that  there were no biscuits, nor any decaffeinated tea.  Eventually an amended order arrived.  Such an embarrassment and certainly not what one would expect in a hotel of standing.",3,2022,09,03
115,Afternoon tea,"I went with my friends for afternoon tea and our waiter was Patrick who was very helpful and passionately explain us how afternoon tea works,he explain us step by step everything with delicious glass of champagne.when the food arrived Patrick explained us every each sandwich and scones and sweets.it was our first experience with afternoon tea and we were greatful for his professionalism and we were thankful he was our waiter with big smile and very good attitude.we will definitely do it sometime again",5,2022,09,01
115,"Great hotel, great location, great staff","The Bloomsbury is an excellent hotel well located in the center of London. The rooms meet the expectation of a hotel in this category and are nice. The highlight was, however, the extremely friendly staff. From the receptionist to the service and the housekeeping: This was really unique. We will return.",5,2022,08,31
115,Birthday Suprise,"I stay at this hotel 2 or 3 times a year. I travel alone and use it as a base for my visits to the theatre.  It is well situated close to the majority of the theatres.  The staff are always polite and treat me exceptionally well.  On arrival I was greeted warmly by the reception staff and informed that I had been upgraded to a junior suite on the 6th floor.  As you can imagine the room was quite large by London standards with a wonderful roll top bath. I popped out for something to eat and on my return found a box of delicious macarons on my desk. The next day I returned from wandering the sights to find a delicious bottle of red wine waiting for me.  Two days later it was my birthday. I was greeted by the wonderful breakfast crew who served me bucks fizz and chocolate truffles.
The rest of my stay was excellent with special thanks to Maria, Gabriella, Alex T and Piotr.  They always had a smile and brightened my mornings everyday.",5,2022,08,30
115,London with the family,"We took advantage of the Bloomsbury's, London with the Family offer, as we were taking our young daughter up to see her first West End show. My husband failed to fill in the questionnaire prior to our stay, so I’m not sure whether we missed any of the special guest amenities for our daughter, but that certainly didn’t affect our stay. We were fortunate enough to have been upgraded to a suite and stayed in rooms 312 and 314 (I think). Side, by side, there was and additional door in the hallway that we could close that allowed us to keep both doors open, allowing us to walk through freely without disturbing other guests. This was perfect in the night when our daughter was asleep. My daughter slept in the comfort of her room, whilst my husband and I relaxed in the suite.
Both rooms were lovely, but the suite was something else. If you are coming to London for a special birthday, anniversary etc, then I highly recommend paying extra. The attention to detail was astounding and every part of the room was luxurious. 
We foolishly didn’t have dinner in the restaurant (our next stay will include a visit!) however, we did sample the cocktails in the Coral Room. My daughter was welcomed, but we did explain to her beforehand she needed to be on her best behaviour and kept her entertained with stickers and colouring in. I ordered ‘play the pyramid’ and it tasted sublime. Presented in a beautiful copper pear drinking vessel, I weep at the fact I did not order more! The cocktail menu is extensive, imaginative and delicious. The bar is beautiful. A must visit! 
Breakfast was included in our stay and it was delicious. I had avocado with feta on sourdough, however I couldn’t finish it as I filled myself up on the delicious offerings available. I certainly didn’t need lunch and only a very light dinner! The hot chocolate was heavenly and my husband and daughters pancakes tasted out of this world. Having eaten breakfast, I certainly regretted having not eaten dinner at the hotels restaurant the night before. On the plus side, it does mean we will have to make a return trip next year… possibly make it an annual trip! 
Thank you so much for a wonderful and memorable stay. I do fear my daughters expectations of hotels rooms have been raised significantly as a result.",5,2022,08,28
115,Second stay - terribly disappointing,"My husband and I just returned from a six-night stay at The Bloomsbury, and it’s highly unlikely that we’ll ever return to this hotel again. While the members of staff are extremely friendly, and make efforts to be helpful, that only goes so far. At a certain point, results are far more important than smiles and apologies, and sadly, The Bloomsbury just failed miserably. 

For the entire duration of our stay, our room was insufferably warm. There was a thermostat in the room, however, each time we’d try to make the room cooler, it would just revert back to a higher temperature - and whatever temperature the thermostat was showing, it was at least 15 degrees warmer. Every morning, at around 9am, the thermostat would shut off completely, and the room would get even hotter - it was like a truly miserable wake up call. We brought this to the attention of the front desk multiple times (4+), and while they were able to override the thermostat’s settings in the evening, it would once again revert back to sweltering in the morning. We’re in Europe about 4-5 times a year, and have never had this issue in any other hotel - it was awful. Had we been able to get out of our reservation, we would have gladly checked out early and gone elsewhere.

Our other main gripe was, unbelievably, the same issue we had two years prior. On one of the days, we had a late start, so, on our way out, I asked the front desk to please have housekeeping replenish the bathroom (toilet paper, towels, tissues). Later on in the evening, we returned to our room to find that the bathroom had new towels and shampoo/conditioner, but no toilet paper or tissues. I’m sorry, but how the heck can you go into a bathroom, see the clearly empty toilet paper hook, and not do anything about it!? That should be the first thing that gets replenished - it’s a basic freaking necessity! How a 4-star hotel could allow this to happen (TWICE!), is unfathomable to me.

Additionally, our room (409) was quite small (even by European standards), had extremely thin walls, and looked directly into a store/showroom. If you’re planning on a short stay, the room is fine, but for anything longer than 2 days, I’d highly recommend upgrading to a larger room. 

At the end of our already crappy stay, we realized at check out that our bill was incorrect. After multiple phone calls, and an email, the overage charge (another guest’s dining bill had been added to ours) was rectified, but it should not have happened in the first place.

While the location of The Bloomsbury is excellent, and the staff is great (thanks to Marta for honoring the complimentary brunch, that was extended to us by the former Manager, re: the toilet paper issue in 2020!), we truly expected A LOT more from a 4-star hotel, that charges what they do. Had all of these issues occurred at a lower end hotel, with a lower price tag, we wouldn’t have been bothered, but The Bloomsbury should have done far better.",2,2022,08,28
115,A+++ You need to stay here!,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at the Bloomsbury for a week in London recently and this was one of the best hotel experiences we have had.  The property is beautiful and well appointed and the staff is incredibly friendly and kind. The location is wonderfully central to most places of interest and very unique.  Special shout out to our concierge Ivan.  He was by far the best concierge I have had assistance from.  To setting up show tickets, cars, in-stay needs, everything was done brilliantly and at the highest standard.  The Bloomsbury is LUCKY to have him and we look forward to staying here again!",5,2022,08,25
115,Coral room drinks 🍸,"Me and my friends were in the coral room for a couple of drinks, last week And were an absolutely fantastic atmosphere and the drinks are just delicious, our waiter was Patrick and he is just perfect for the job, very friendly and helpful to making choices for the drinks and some snacks! I really appreciated having him as our waiter without asking he to top up for us water, smiling and answering for all questions! Definitely we come back to have more ! Patrick you are amazing 👏 thank you! Hugs from Germany",5,2022,08,23
115,A brilliant stay!,"My husband and I recently visited for my birthday. It is a beautiful hotel. A warm greeting on arrival and we were checked in quickly. We booked a Deluxe room (Room 212), it was well designed, spacious and very quiet. The bed was extremely comfy too and we slept like babies!

We had the pleasure of meeting Marcella. She organised complimentary cocktails for us to enjoy in the Coral Room. We were over the moon when she mentioned there would be live jazz playing in the Bloomsbury Club that evening and kindly booked us a table for when we would return from the theatre. Marcella made our stay extra special, thank you.

This hotel has so much to offer. We stay in London a few times a year and like to stay somewhere different each time but on our next visit, we are definitely going to stay here again. 5*

The Bloomsbury Club has such a vibe. Mood lit with cosy seating and a perfect view of the live musicians. I would highly recommend going during your stay.

The Coral Room is visually exciting and it was great fun to sit at the bar and watch the cocktails being made. The bartender kindly brought over a Happy Birthday plate with macarons for us to enjoy. It was a great place to enjoy a drink before we went to dinner and the theatre. 

One critique to make is the breakfast service. Lacked the finesse of the other areas of hospitality in the hotel. That being said the quality of the continental and cooked options were enjoyable. ",5,2022,08,23
115,20/10 Would Recommend,"My husband and I stayed at the Bloomsbury for four nights. It was honestly the most incredible experience. From the second our transportation pulled up to the time we pulled away, everything was wonderful. The staff was very nice, helpful and lovely to talk to. The Coral Room looked like something out of a movie, the breakfast that was included with our stay was over the top and the Dyson hair dryer in the room was just the sprinkles on top of the cherry on top! We want to give a special shout-out to the concierge, especially Ivan. It was like having our own personal assistant while we were there. He helped us book transportation, a bus tour, and tickets to a show. We really can't say enough about him or our experience overall. We honestly can't wait to come back!",5,2022,08,20
115,No value for money,"This hotel is classed as a 5 star quality hotel.
Our room No : 715 was very small and lacking in space 
The reception staff were very attentive but the waiters on duty in the Coral Bar last night were very slow with service and never offered any nibbles with our 4 drinks which cost £67.50 including service charge, but very poor service
Would not spend this amount on a room without expecting exceptional facilities so will not book this hotel again nor would I recommend",3,2022,08,20
115,Exquisite service and comfort at The Bloomsbury,"Perhaps the BEST service I have ever received at a hotel in 30+ years. Well appointed, albeit modestly sized room, that was terrifically comfortable.  Location was perfect — near the action and accessible to the Underground, but just off the beaten path on a quiet side street. LOVED the heated bathroom floor.  Bed was especially comfortable, too. No view from the window, but had a quiet room at the end of the hall.  The service end-to-end was exceptional — from room service, to the bell man, to reception, to housekeeping. Would absolutely look at a Doyle Collection property again on my next international adventure.",5,2022,08,19
115,Stylish stay at The Bloomsbury,"My boyfriend and I recently stayed at The Bloomsbury for a long weekend and had a fantastic time. The hotel is stylish, the rooms are very tastefully decorated with great attention to detail (current magazines in the room, bathroom amenities and turn down service were all fabulous) - it's definitely a cool hotel with a true London spirit perfect for a romantic getaway or even a fun girls weekend. The location is very convenient -   easy to walk everywhere or 1 min to the tube if you need to as well.
What really stood out to us was the service, this hotel is full of staff that go above and beyond : From Maria (breakfast service) remembering our names and coffee orders on day two to George(The Dalloway terrace) spending time with us to explain & recommend items from the dinner menu and showing us around - this hotel runs on some truly wonderful people and we will definitely be back!",5,2022,08,15
115,"Excellent hotel, great service and a pleasant stay","This was my latest stay at the hotel, having stayed here many times several years ago for work. The Bloomsbury provides what I would consider a five star service at a great price point. The hotel is high quality, the service is excellent and for me, provides a great experience for both leisure and business stays. Me and my wife thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and we are particularly grateful to Leonardo and John Dunne who worked at the bar, who accommodated my wife's food allergies with passion and empathy. They made her feel safe that what she was drinking was made with care and she loved the drinks they made. We will return to this excellent hotel on our next trip to London for sure.",5,2022,08,15
115,Fabulous stay thank you.,"Services was as good as we expected. Everyone friendly and welcoming and always willing to help. The breakfast was the best hotel breakfast I have ever had and the Guinness bread was amazing! We stayed in room 101 as we were 3 adults and if was lovely. Large, fabulous bathroom and toiletries and we didn’t feel like we had to be quiet like you do in some hotels as we had no neighbours! It is expensive but for its location and quality I think it was worth it.",5,2022,08,15
115,Perfect Honeymoon Getaway in the City,"My husband and I want to extend our sincerest thanks to the Bloomsbury Hotel team for providing such a wonderful and relaxing environment during our stay. We loved all of the thoughtful touches that made our honeymoon that much more memorable - the generous room upgrade, the fresh rose petals in our room, the macarons offering us congratulations on this milestone, and the complimentary English sparking wine are just a few of the many ways that your team made sure that we had an experience we would never forget. We also appreciated being able to return to a tidy and clean room after a day full of sightseeing activities. The friendly faces that we met during our time at The Bloomsbury, however, truly made this experience exceptional. We fully intend to stay at this hotel again during our next time in London and cannot recommend the experience enough. The Bloomsbury Hotel staff certainly have a special blend of elegance and hospitality down to an art form - thank you for such a special stay!",5,2022,08,14
115,Amazing long weekend at the Bloomsbury,I have recently stayed at The Bloomsbury for a long weekend with my girlfriend. It is a hidden gem in the middle of London. The location is superb for both shopping and also exploring London. Despite central London location the hotel is super quiet so you get a good night sleep. The staff in the hotel was very helpful and attentive and the service was impeccable. It was clear that they take pride in their work. Our room was very spacious with a free-standing bath and had a great layout. It felt like a home away from home. The breakfast has been very tasty and Maria together with her colleagues Andreea and Patricia brightened the day from the start. Highly recommend staying at the hotel and we would definitely come back.,5,2022,08,13

115,Great London vacation at the Bloomsbury,We stayed 8 days at the Bloomsbury. We visited London for the first time and from the moment we checked in with Emmanuel the service was great. The concierge Brian and the tall blond guy from Moldova unfortunately i cannot remember his name but he was so helpful and accommodating.  The team at breakfast especially Maria all A+.

The hotel were so kind and so very helpful. It made a stressful time so much easier for us. They accommodated my daughter and her 2 children in one room my husband and I just round the corner on the same floor. All the staff were thoughtful and kind . Maria and her breakfast team looked after our granddaughters beautifully. The concierge was excellent, reception staff brilliant. Food and wine great. We have stayed in many London hotels and the Bloomsbury is definitely the best . 
We wouldn’t stay anywhere else now. 
Special mention to Ricardo, thanks so much for organising the rooms .",5,2022,08,01
115,Home from Home,"We stayed for a weekend and having stayed on a number of occasions previously we received a lovely welcome back. Ivan at the front Desk and Maria at breakfast went over and above to ensure we had a memorable stay. Our experience improves each time we stay, facilities, breakfast, Coral Room all very chilled and excellent. The team effort in the Bloomsbury stands out as a unique experience compared to other hotels. Location is ideal to walk to practically all the main sites in the City which was buzzing.",5,2022,08,01
115,Best service and marvelous hotel,"Our experience at the Bloomsbury makes us wish they had hotels across the globe. Staff was experienced, helpful, courteous, and cordial.   Rooms was comfortable, clean, and had all the amenities we required.  I cannot express who wonderful our experience was at this hotel.  This rating comes with the fact that our stay was hampered by our daughter getting sick with a stomach bug during our trip.  The staff helped us get her comfortable and provided us with all their resources to keep up here energy with food outside of the menu provided by room service.  I rate this hotel the best out of any hotel we have every stayed during our numerous trips around the world.",5,2022,07,28
115,Great spot!,The Bloomsbury is a first class hotel tucked away from the crowds in central London.  All the action is just a block away!  The restaurant and bar  is excellent and the service was impeccable.  We really enjoyed our stay!,5,2022,07,26
115,Charming and welcoming hotel,"The hotel is so well placed and welcoming, a real surprise. Most enchanting is the personnel, in particular, Marcela at reception (very attentive and helpful, so pleasant personality) and Andreea, Maria, Estelita, Oussama and Patricia at breakfast (so cheerful, always available and helpful). Definitely a place to return. Out entirely family (two adults and two teenagers) was happy with the stay.",5,2022,07,25
115,"Exceptional Service, Great Location, Very Comfortable","We visited the Bloomsbury a few years ago and loved the location and the charm of the hotel. We returned this summer and were not disappointed. The staff at the hotel is exceptional, especially Marta De Santis!  She went above and beyond.  We had an issue with one of the two rooms we were initially in and Marta and her staff immediately addressed the issue and swiftly moved us to two other fabulous rooms. The rooms were a great size, very clean and were supplied with all of the amenities one needs while traveling. Maria continued to check in on us during our stay and made what could have been a frustrating experience a truly exceptional one.  Her customer service speaks volumes about the overall quality of the hotel. In addition to Maria, the concierge was very helpful booking transfers to and from the airport and even booking a blow-dry appointment for my daughter.  The restaurant at the hotel is not only beautiful and delicious, but the servers there (and in the breakfast room) are lovely and helpful as well. All in all, five stars!",5,2022,07,24
115,Exceptional Service,"We visited 10th-12th July as part of a Wimbledon weekend, gifted to us by a dear friend.
My husband was quite poorly  ( he has terminal cancer) and couldn’t come down for breakfast, Maria & Estelita  were adamant they would take him some breakfast just in case he would feel like eating a bit later.
I ordered breakfast to be delivered the following day as it was only £4 for this service and we had a late check out, I think either I got confused with my order or they were being extremely generous but it was 2 trays! 

They looked after me so well and I can’t thank them enough for being so kind.
We had an amazing stay and I will certainly be staying again in the future.

115,"Perfect Location, Comfortable Hotel","We chose the Bloomsbury for a couple of reasons....one, it was located perfectly for our agenda, and two, it has a great reputation for quality.  We love going to plays when in London, and Bloomsbury is close enough to walk to all the shows, in fact, the Dominion Theatre is right next door (we went to see Grease there)  Our room was fabulously clean, pretty good size for a London hotel room.  Had all the amenities we needed, and quick wi-fi.  Everyone was friendly and helpful, loved the eating/drinking choices in the hotel and nearby.  Located on a quiet side street, we never heard any street noise from our room.  Highly recommend staying here when in London.",5,2022,07,23
115,"Our favorite London hotel, bar, and breakfast all in one.","We have stayed at the Bloomsbury many times over the years, and we never feel compelled to look elsewhere.   The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are impeccable and clean, and the location is perfect (walk to most all of Central London, or hop on the tube with two stops just a short walk away.)

The staff of the hotel are consistently warm, welcoming, and go out of their way to ensure you have a wonderful time both in and out of the hotel.

The Coral Room is a stunning place for tea or cocktails, with some of the best bartenders we've ever seen.   The service in the Coral Room and the staff are equally amazing.

Brunch at the Dalloway Terrace is a must.   The amazing floral wall that changes throughout the seasons, the food, and the overall ambience are perfect.",5,2022,07,20
115,The Perfect Base for your London Adventure,"The Bloomsbury is fantastic! Small enough that everyone knows your names, asks about your day, tries to make your experience better. The service is incredible. Decor is upscale and fun but not pretentious. The breakfast is yummy with lots of choices. Andreea in the breakfast room is particularly sweet. One morning my daughter felt too tired to come down to breakfast and they brought it up to her room so beautifully presented that she felt like royalty. Each time we were venturing out the concierge walked us to the end of the block to ensure we were heading in the right direction. Every time we returned we were greeted by name and asked about our adventure! The location is perfect for walking around London. The Coral Room is fun for a pre-show cocktail or two. Highly recommend The Bloomsbury. ",5,2022,07,20
115,Fabulous,"Our second stay @ The Bloomsbury and we absolutely love it. The decor is fabulous - crazy wallpaper, bold colours, amazing art hanging everywhere and it works fantastically. Breakfast is excellent and I’d highly recommend the love jazz in the Bloomsbury Club.",5,2022,07,19
115,Amazing Hotel with the BEST Staff,I never ever write reviews of hotels but The Bloomsbury and their staff were too good not to tell everyone.  We head to London at least once a year and will never stay anywhere else.  The hotel itself is lovely and quiet and has two of the best bars in London.  I also would like to personally thank Sebastian (the night concierge) for assisting with the extension of our stay at sometime after midnight after there were issues with our flight home the next day.,5,2022,07,18
115,An oasis in town,"It was first time I visited this hotel. A lovely place, easily reached by public transport in particularly now the Elizabeth line has opened. The employees are very welcoming and nothing is too much to ask. Lovely room and a very nice sleep. 

The Dalloway restaurant is an oasis in town with its  beautiful decoration and lovely food. Spoiled for choice. 

The hotel is located within walking distance of Regent street, Convent garden and Charlotte street with many small restaurants. 

Will for sure be back!",5,2022,07,16

115,A reunion of university friends,"This is an extraordinary hotel.  Not only is its' location superb but the staff cannot do enough for you.  No detail is too small.

Thanks again and see you next time.",5,2022,07,13
115,Wonderful getaway,"My husband and I recently stayed for a final getaway before we expect our first child. The front desk was warm and welcoming and upon check-in offered us a temporary room to freshen up after a long journey since our room was not ready. They gifted us a sweet note and bear for our newest addition and helped us navigate the city. We used hotel suggestions for dinner reservations and all of the restaurants were excellent. We also experienced fabulous service at each bar and restaurant. They had delicious drinks, food and even mocktails. Fabulous stay overall and would highly recommend!",5,2022,07,11
115,LUX BOUTIQUE HOTEL IN THE HEART OF LONDON,"You cannot beat the location of this hotel which is right by Tottenham Court Road station and short walk to Covent Garden, theatreland and  Oxford Street. While this is a lux stay at lux prices, location was important to me for close proximity to shops and restaurants. The other major selling point of this hotel is its facilities including the Croa",5,2022,07,11
115,Gorgeous Hotel,It’s all in the details here. First class experience from top to bottom. Could not recommend this hotel more. Beautiful decor. The staff are so attentive and kind.

115,"Wonderful  hotel, great location","Our daughter visiting from Australia arrange our stay, celebrating being together after three years apart.
Great location, a short walk to The British Museum, Theatres, Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road.    Marta the Hotel Manager and her staff were all very welcoming and polite, nothing was too much trouble for them. 
For breakfast, there  was an excellent choice from the menu, also continental available.  The breakfast staff,  Pamela, Estelita and Maria were very friendly and attentive.
The Coral Bar and the Dalloway Terrace are highly recommended.  Rossela, George and all members of staff were excellent.",5,2022,07,09
115,Incredible Stay- highly recommend,My husband and I celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary at this hotel.  The place is very impressive- every detail is carefully curated.

115,The Most Special Couple of Days,"We were made to feel so welcome upon arrival and every member of staff were so polite and welcoming, it made our stay so special.  The rooms are of a fantastic standard, breakfast was absolutely delicious with a fantastic choice from the menu and additional continental choices if you wish. If you are wanting a hotel of the highest of standards, friendly and welcoming staff in a  central location.  The British Museum, Oxford Street, Tottenham Court Road and all theatres just a short walk  away then this hotel is for you.  I can’t thank the hotel manager (Martha) enough for the extra little touches she arranged for our daughter  when knowing  we were here for her graduation . We will never forget this!",5,2022,07,07
115,Great stay,A wonderful cosy warm place to stay. The hotel has a magnificent location situated very close to a tube station. the staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. The meals were wonderful as was the service. We will be back,5,2022,07,05
115,Beautiful hotel in a great location.,"This hotel is in a very busy location yet the front entrance is nicely tucked away on a side street.  There are many restaurants and things to do right outside their door.  I liked its proximity to the British museum and Soho.  
We stayed in a Deluxe Queen.  The room was nicely decorated and very clean.  Looked as though it had been refurbished in the last couple of years. The room was small but they made good use of the space.   The bathroom was bigger than I had expected.  We had a nice walk in shower.  The only thing I would mention is that the shower could use some maintenance.  There were some areas that had rust stains. The bathroom could ideally use some updating, but like I said it was a good size.   Housekeeping did a beautiful job every day and they even had turn down service at night which is so rare these days.  
The staff as a whole was lovely and always asking if you needed anything.  Our rate included the breakfast.  The breakfast is on the lower level and had a really nice atmosphere.  Service was great.  The buffet had some delicious items.  The hot items off the menu were hit or miss, but overall we enjoyed the breakfast.  We also visited the Coral Room which is cozy and beautifully decorated.  Very relaxing place to have a drink and their bartenders are top notch.  But, we found it to be way overpriced and the food was average at best. 
Overall though, I would recommend this hotel and would definitely consider staying here again if ever back in London.",4,2022,07,03
115,Amazing staff,"Had a lovely stay at The Bloomsbury for a London wedding. First time away with our 2 month old and the staff could not have been kinder helping us with everything and were so accommodating.

Thank you again.",5,2022,07,03
115,Amazing all around!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here! Right when we walked in we were greeted with smiling faces! Our rooms were absolutely perfect, spacious and comfortable!

We had breakfast every day downstairs and it was delicious! The service is outstanding! They knew us by name every morning which was fantastic!

115,Beautiful hotel,"My mother and I stayed at the Bloomsbury for 9 nights for a girls getaway. The hotel is in a great location close to the West end and Covent garden.

We like the Bloomsbury for its central location next to the theaters, British museum and Soho's restaurants. We'll go again!",5,2022,06,29
115,June 2022,"This is a fantastic hotel, we really enjoyed our stay. It was made all the more special for my wife’s 50th birthday by the wonderful Marta, who arranged balloons and a sweet treat for the room.

We received a really warm welcome and the hotel is in a brilliant location. Just a shame we could only stay one night!",5,2022,06,28
115,Avoid room 708,Avoid room 708 see attached the picture of the window just a joke for a hotel claiming to be a luxury one.

Still the room is there so be warned as price stays the same.,1,2022,06,26
115,Gorgeous boutique hotel,"We had never stayed at a Doyie Collection hotel previously but wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. The Bloomsbury is a beautiful hotel, lovely luxury touches throughout and in an excellent location just off Oxford Street. Despite its central location, it was wonderfully quiet.

We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again on our next trip to London.",5,2022,06,25
115,The gold standard for British Hospitality,"From Sebastian’s warm greeting after a long flight to the breakfast staff’s (Maria, Estelita, Anna, Andreea & Mary) extra effort to remember our breakfast order, the Bloomsbury is the perfect example of quality and kindness. The stunning interiors also are a delightful feature. Looking forward to the next time I can curl up in the sitting room next to the fire place.",5,2022,06,20
115,Excellent service at The Coral Room/Dalloway Terrace.,Expectional service by Magdalena at The Dalloway Terrace who is a real gem to the team! She made us feel welcome as if we were at home.

115,Great hotel!,"We had another excellent stay at The Bloomsbury in London! As last time, our room was comfortable, quiet and super clean and the bathroom very well equipped. The location in central London is perfect, the tube station close nearby - as is the British Museum. The  staff, same as last time, were so friendly and welcoming. The days got off to a good start with a varied breakfast. Excellent service from Estelita and Maria - we remember Estelita from last time too, some years ago, which surely speaks for the hotel!",5,2022,06,11
115,Great Service,"Room was spacious, for London standards, and clean. Hotel has a great location and is really quiet despite being in the center and only 1min to tottenham court road tube station.

Service was great, very friendly and helpful. Esielita, Maria and Ousama were absolutely wonderful and took great care of me during breakfast.  

I will come back for sure.",5,2022,06,10
115,Quiet charming germ,"Hotel is in a beautiful quiet location. Rooms are fine. Breakfast is very good, with great hospitality from Maria and Ousama. The bar has had its day and is in need of a makeover. Staff in the bar are indifferent and unmotivated. Staff at reception very welcoming and helpful.",4,2022,06,09
115,Best hotel in London hands down,"Estelita, María, Georgi, Victor, James, Ivan and absolutely everyone else make this hotel the best I have ever stayed at.

Thank you for making this feel like home, on so many levels.",5,2022,06,08
115,Royal experience at the Bloomsbury,"A night in the luxury studio suite is a royal experience, the perfect way to spend the Jubilee weekend!  We received a warm welcome by Roxane Vesin who ensured every need was met throughout our stay.  The best thing about the suite was the exquisite bathroom, floor to ceiling marble, large walk in marble shower with what is best described as a surround shower spray system.  My absolute favourite feature has to be the huge ball and claw bath with it's own remote for the bathroom TV!  
Breakfast must get a mention, delicious fresh produce. I loved the eggs royale, they make the best hollandaise sauce and great service from Maria, Ousama and Patricia.
The hotel has excellent facilities, lunch at the Dalloway Terrace was delicious and a night cap in the Bloomsbury Club with live jazz music was the perfect ending to our stay.
We will absolutely be back!",5,2022,06,05
115,"Relaxing stay, Great Staff, Perfect Location","This hotel exudes calm. The staff is friendly and the design is inspired.

115,Excellent staff,"Very helpful staff.  Bar / club room open very late for a nightcap.  Only suggestion would to have beer on tap - suggest a few local ales, after all, this is England!  Bath well appointed, bed very comfortable.",5,2022,06,03
115,"Nice, quiet hotel just off London’s shopping belt","Location is excellent! Few minutes from the start of the Oxford Road shopping belt.

Attentive Staff. 

Breakfast offering are better than most when compared to other hotels in London. Appreciated the option to order from their ala carte menu.

One of the staff, Maria Estelita, was very attentive to the requests of all guests during breakfast and made the effort to recall my breakfast preference. Great work!

Luxurious room.",5,2022,05,29
115,An unexpected suprise,"Once again I was looking forward to staying in this wonderful hotel, having stayed several times before, and I wasn't disappointed.  
On my arrival I was greeted by the door staff who escorted me to the reception taking care of my very heavy suitcase. The reception staff greeted me warmly and suprised me by saying that I had been upgraded to a junior suite.  The check in was very efficient and I was quickly on my way to my room.  The room was very spacious with a bedroom, sitting room, and separate bathroom.  The bathroom was gourgeous with separate toilet and bidet, roll top bath and a walk in shower. Luxury.
Breakfast is always good at The Bloomsbury with a staff that are always friendly, welcoming and nothing is too much trouble for them.  I must say a special thankyou to Maria, Estilita, Mary and Andrea who looked after me whilst I was there.  They make it a great way to start the day.
I use the hotel as a base to visit the west end shows and use the coral room and the bloomsbury club to have a nightcap before bed.  I must thank the staff for looking after me and especially the smart young man who ensured that I was looked after extremely well.  I didn't catch his name but he is a credit to the hotel.
I was also honoured that the general manager took time out of her busy schedule to chat with me and ensure I was having a good time.
I look forward to my next visit",5,2022,05,28

115,Excellent stay at The Bloomsbury!,"My 22 year old daughter and I stayed at the Bloomsbury after her college graduation, and could not have been more pleased with our stay. The location is EXCELLENT and a great starting point for any London exploration. There are several tube stations close by and they are easy to navigate. The hotel itself is wonderful. Our room was comfortable and extremely clean. We had two twin beds which worked perfectly for us. We had breakfast each day, which was delicious and cheerfully served by Andrea, Patricia, Maria and Estelita. We appreciated all of their help and certainly enjoyed the delicious food! The breakfast choices were very good as well.  We also enjoyed the Coral Room after the theater on several occasions. The drink selections from their wonderful “drink book” were all delicious! I will certainly make the Bloomsbury my hotel of choice in London from now on. So glad to have discovered this gem!",5,2022,05,27
115,Beautiful and friendly.,"My husband and I stayed here on a bit of a splurge. It was worth every penny. They have the friendliest and most attentive staff. The rooms are gorgeous and huge and the beds are the most luxurious I have ever experienced in any hotel. A beautiful, upscale experience that never feels stuffy or cold. The concierge was so helpful and came to our room to help us with our COVID tests (for re-entry into the US). An overall lovely experience. We'll return again and again.  Another reviewer called The Bloomsbury an oasis. Absolutely spot-on. A great place to relax after a busy day.",5,2022,05,25

115,A true oasis!,"For the money, it’s hard to imagine a better hotel in the heart of London.  Incredibly comfortable beds—our king was a true American-sized king (significantly larger than a UK king)—with superb linens, toiletries, and furnishings.  Everything in the room was in excellent condition, and the room was cleaned from top to bottom daily.  The hotel is elegant, tasteful, and well-designed.  Wonderful, friendly staff in every corner of the hotel!  And do not miss breakfast.  ",5,2022,05,25

115,Weekend in London,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury for a weekend of shopping and Theatre. The hotel  is conveniently located for the theatre district and just round the corner from the tube station.

115,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location, Great Staff","This hotel is a gem. Such a lovely staff and experience. I will stay here again when in London. In addition to a having fabulous restaurant and bar, there is a jazz club in the hotel that is world class. ",5,2022,05,22

115,Lovely visit at Bloomsbury,"I visited the Bloomsbury while in Tottenham Court Road for the day and had a great time. It was great service especially from the staff at the front desk who welcomed us and showed us the coral room: Lola, Safiya, Marta and Konrad. Would definitely visit again.",5,2022,05,22
115,Fabulous choice...,"For an early birthday trip with my sister. The food in Dalloway Terrace was delicious, (I have never eaten such succulent, tender tiger prawns) plenty of options on the menu too. 
The decadent Coral Room was perfect for pré lunch drinks and cocktails and small bites later in the evening. Loved the design detail of the cocktail menu.
We stayed in a Classic twin room, which was comfortable and a good size, the bed was really comfortable and the pillows were luxurious, like big clouds of comfort.
The breakfast was also very good, the chargrilled bacon and scrambled egg, again delicious, there were plenty of alternatives to choose from.
Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely visit again.",5,2022,05,21
115,BEAUTIFUL STAY AND AMAZING STAFF,"The hotel is very nice and the staff is simply amazing! Special mention to Mary from the breakfast room, simply amazing, and Shakira from Coral Room, incredibly sweet. Definitely we will come back next time.",5,2022,05,18
115,Outstanding,"From the moment we arrived, our brief stay at the Bloomsbury was first class!! A warm welcome and early check in as our room was ready. The receptionist- Roxane was lovely and couldn’t do enough for us, she even brought some macaroons to our room as i mentioned it was my birthday! As we booked direct with the hotel, we also received a complimentary drink in the bar. My husband and I felt very special and said to each other how this might be the best hotel we’ve stayed in in London (and there’s been a lot to compare to). 
The room was comfortable, clean and well decorated.
We were sorry to go and will hopefully return one day  
Thankyou, the Bloomsbury",5,2022,05,17
115,Ideal for Theatreland,"Thanks especially to the breakfast team inc Maria (so smiley!) and the concierge who were all great
Thanks Marta for the assistance and kind gesture that was much unexpected but appreciated
Rooms and hotel are really excellent and recommended
We will see you again",5,2022,05,16
115,A nice experience,"Nice... not outstanding, but very nice.  Reception staff were first class.  Breakfast was a little disappointing, but I think that was because I was expecting better... 
Rooms are OK, with good storage and the beds are very comfy. The bathroom was cramped and the access in and out of the bath/shower is dangerous in my opinion (awkward and very slippery) 
All told, a nice experience. ",4,2022,05,13
115,"The Bloomsbury is a fine, beautiful, friendly and excellent hotel!","Lovely beautiful hotel to stay in and with the name of Bloomsbury. We have been there many times and will be there many times! The breakfast is excellently taken care of by Estelita and Maria!
Of course all the staff is very friendly and professional! In short: The Bloomsbury is a fine, beautiful, friendly and excellent hotel in the heart of London.",5,2022,05,11
115,Spring in London,"The accommodations were lovely, and the staff was both professional and kind. They addressed our inquires with prompt attention. They made us feel we were valued customers. The Bloomsbury is a great location. Very Convenient to Parliament area, Covent Garden, Theatre and dining. ",5,2022,05,11
115,Helpful staff at the Bloomsbury,"Very cordial and accommodating staff in the breakfast room-Estrelita, Maria, Mary and Andreza were helpful throughout my stay and especially when I arrived early in the morning without my room ready. Remarkable memory for names. The eggs Florentine for breakfast were excellent. Excellent location for access to the British Museum and transportation.",4,2022,05,10
115,May visit to London with extended family,"The Bloomsbury property is outstanding! Beautiful bar, pub with jazz and outdoor restaurant. 
The location of the hotel cannot be beat. Easy to walk or take public transportation to all popular attractions.
Plenty of restaurants, pubs and shopping near the hotel.
The staff was amazing and made us feel very welcome. 
I will definitely stay here again on my next visit. ",5,2022,05,10
115,A sad ending to an otherwise enjoyable experience,"In celebration of my husband birthday I arranged a weekend stay with close friends.   The ambiance, hospitality, room, decor and location were faultless.  The reception upon arrival was excellent as were the staff in the Coral Room and Bloomsbury Club and those throughout the hotel.   Unfortunately this evaporated by the experience at departure.  A clipped tone and curt attitude, in addition to getting the bill wrong and charging my guests, when I had explained several times that the cost of the stay was to be borne by myself, left a negative impact.  Departure of guests is as important as arrival because this is the last impression they take with them.",4,2022,05,02
115,"Lovely hotel, great location.","Had a wonderful time staying at this beautiful and charming boutique hotel.  The staff was extremely helpful and the housekeeping was excellent. Ivan, the concierge, arranged for limo service from the airport to the hotel and back to the airport on our departure, which was reasonable and reliable, made things easy (arranged via email before arrival). He also helped us with travel info for a day trip to Canterbury and arranged  our Covid tests to be done at the hotel 24 hours before our departure, which was extremely smooth and easy.  We really felt the staff really worked hard to please.  Loved the cozy lobby with a warm fireplace, where we could sit with friends. The food was great, the Bloomsbury Club bar was cozy and interesting, enjoyed high tea there as well.  We usually stay at a sister hotel in Kensington, this time we chose  Bloomsbury; as it's a short walk to the British Museum, to Soho and Covent Garden and to other sights.  Tube stops are close by  and there's an abundance of food choices.  An truly enjoyable stay!",5,2022,04,30
115,My new favourite place.,"I stayed 4 nights at the Bloomsbury for work and every moment of my stay was just wonderful. Genuinely lovely staff, day and night. Thanks so much to the night manager who was happy to show me around the library, the first editions, and the deconsecrated chapel. The lovely young woman who was my waitress for dinner, it's always nice to hear a familiar accent in London and I'm delighted you've found such a wonderful place to work! Super grateful too for the camomile tea each night. My new favourite place :)",5,2022,04,29
115,Very good breakfast and concierge experience,"The overall experience was in the average for a 5 stars hotel.
Although, at the check in I was assigned a room with no view (the window was facing a grey wall less than one meter distant) which in my view is not acceptable, even more for a 5 stars hotel at the given prices. That experience was very unpleasant and spoiled the overall experience. After my complaint I was given a better room.
The best part was the breakfast service with Mary and the concierge with Ivan. They both were extremely kind and professional. 
The location is perfect for visiting the British Museum and the theatre’s area. 

",4,2022,04,27
115,Great Service,"I arrived at the hotel and my card wasn't working on the card reacher machine. I had a long overnight flight, I was dead tired and hadn't slept in almost 24 hours. I was offered tea and helped to my room to get myself situated and figure out the preauthorization. I was able to pay online after resting up a bit. I was exhausted and this type of patience and service was much needed. ",5,2022,04,24
115,Great Hotel,"What a great Hotel.  We enjoyed our stay very much and we were well looked after.  The room was well appointed, the beds comfy and the style and ambience everywhere was really lovely.  Breakfast was in a lovely basement room with a wide buffet selection as well as a menu of hot dishes.  The Hotel is especially convenient for us as we have business nearby. We will definitely visit here again.",5,2022,04,24
115,Warm and excellent hotel,"From check-in to check-out the staff could not do more. Rooms were very stylish and comfortable. Location is excellent.
The overall approach in this hotel is cleary ""guest first at all times"".

115,The Bloomsbury Experience,"This is an excellent hotel with beautiful facilities and very friendly and welcoming staff. We have stayed for weekend breaks both last year and just now and we had a great time in London. The hotel is ideally situated for site seeing trips.
The Dalloway Terrace serves superb food and drink and it's really nice to be able to sit out and eat in the evenings regardless of the weather.",5,2022,04,18
115,"Best location, gracious staff, lovely breakfast!","We just returned from a family visit to London and had a wonderful week-long stay at The Bloomsbury. The property is in a perfect location, close to the British Museum and wonderful restaurants, and walking distance to many key sites without being too close to the busy crowds. Could not be better located. 

Another high point is the staff. They were so helpful throughout our stay, From Jonathan printing out directions for us before we were even able to check in, to Brian at the concierge desk helping with our required COVID tests, no request was too much.  

A huge shout out as well to the wonderfully helpful and gracious crew at breakfast - Maria, Estelita, Hussajew, and Mary. We did not have high expectations for the complimentary breakfast that was part of our stay, but we were very pleasantly surprised. Wonderful menu - kids loved the pancakes with ice cream! and the avocado toast was delicious - plus lots of a la carte options. We were greeted warmly and by name every morning and they truly made us feel welcome at the hotel! It made it easy to get the kids up and ready for every day as they didn't want to miss breakfast.

Finally, the hotel design is beautiful. Love all of the public spaces.

We look forward to returning to London and to the Bloomsbury, hopefully soon!",5,2022,04,16
115,Very satisfied customer,"My partner and I visited to celebrate our anniversary and really enjoyed our stay. Jonathan, Ivan and the receptionist Marcella were just a few of the many staff that made our stay so memorable. The first two helped us make reservations on several occasions and Marcella was amazing when we had issues entering our room with the key card. Would definitely look to visit again!",5,2022,04,16
115,5 wonderful days in London,"This was our sixth trip to London.  Each visit has been extraordinary and this was no exception.
We stayed in the beautiful Bloomsbury Hotel near the British Museum and West End.  It is in a great location.
The staff at this hotel is knowledgeable, attentive, kind and helpful.  From our 
initial check in, to the wonderful breakfasts with greetings each morning by Maria and Mary who knew our names after the first meal, to the housekeeping staff who made our room so comfortable with their turn down service, to Brian who helped with preparing our Covid tests for our return flight, to Dale who assisted us with locating our return plane tickets and printing the boarding passes(Delta's website was a challenge that day), everyone had smiles and warm greetings.",5,2022,04,16

115,Very enjoyable stay,"We had a most enjoyable long weekend at the Bloomsbury last week. We had stayed there years ago and we were not disappointed this time. The bedroom was very well turned out, clean and the bed very comfortable. The breakfast included fresh fruit and juices, a good choice of hot dishes and very good coffee. We sought advice from the concierge on a few matters and he was most helpful.  Reception staff were helpful too. We had drinks in the Bar downstairs one night and were entertained by really good jazz trio.",5,2022,03,31
115,Simply flawless.,"We had the pleasure to stay at the Bloomsbury last weekend for one night in a luxury studio.
From the way that we where greeted at the door, the information and friendliness of the receptionist and just simply the beauty of the room…the stay was flawless.
We also had a fantastic cocktail in the Bloomsbury Club Bar and of course the Coral Room. 
Tipp: The Live Jazz music in the bar downstairs is phenomenal!

The Staff are the true stars of this hotel - so friendly, proactive and accommodating - this is the BEST quality service in London. I felt so much at home. The hotel itself is gorgeous, with a beautiful restaurant, bar - it was lovely sitting on the outdoor patio every evening for dinner. This will definitely be my first choice of hotel when I visit London again.",5,2022,03,31
115,Flawless.,"The location could not be better, walking to countless marvels in under ten minutes or access to the Tube at Tottenham Court Road just around the corner.  From the physical structure to the people who make it run, everything about this stay was a joy.  Breakfast every morning was something to look forward to, as the food and selection is divine... but again, the people - Patricia, Andrea, Estelita, and Mary, who alone would be reason enough to return for her thoughtful kindness and warm smile.  The Concierge Team, particularly Brian, took excellent care with every detail.  Then there is the room.  Bright, but the blackout curtains offered some of the best night's sleep we've had in a long while, spacious... stunning eclectic decor and great storage!  The bathroom.  Its not fair to try to capture this in word.  Stunning.  We cannot recommend Bloomsbury (and the Dalloway Terrace) with any more abundant praise!",5,2022,03,30
115,A luxury experience thanks to the amazing staff,"This was our first stay at this hotel but it will not be our last. From the moment we arrived to after we had left the property, every member of staff went above and beyond to make sure our stay was as special as it could be. The doorman, the reception staff and Sebastian, The Dalloway Terrace staff, Loucella in The Coral room, and the breakfast team all were amazing. The service we received felt very  personal, professional and very welcoming. Matched with the wonderful surroundings of the hotel, it's bars and terrace, our weekend away was very memorable and we very much look forward to returning when we are next in London.",5,2022,03,28

in addition, I had a problem in the check-in times, so I asked receptionist to try and help me. She never came back to me with that matter - I was expecting more personal care from Hotel at that level.",3,2022,03,28
115,"really nice hotel, highly recommended.","This hotel is so nice, lovely atmosphere, nice rooms, great bars, particularly the basement cocktail bar.

We also loved the Coral Bar!",5,2022,03,27
115,Great Hotel and Location in Central London,"Excellent option for business meetings. Rooms are not very big, but clean and comfortable. Large meeting rooms and excellent service and very good quality of the food. Top experience for breakfast with Mary, Estelita and Andrea serving guests and offering them a great start of the day.",5,2022,03,24
115,Disappointing,"We visited for the valentines weekend and due to the great reviews, we were really looking forward to our stay. On arrival at 4pm, our room was not ready which was a slight inconvenience as we were heading out shortly but we got a voucher for a drink at the bar so waiting there. We were taken to our room when it was ready and our bags were not there. We called and asked for them to be brought up and were given 2 bags which were not ours. We were quite concerned where our bags were and they were finally located - by this time we were late for our plans. On arrival back to the hotel we had a drink in the bar and then headed up to our room where we found our key wouldn’t work. We headed down the reception and were given a new key. Again, this didn’t work. The receptionist came up and tried the master key but found that the key lock mechanism had run out of battery. We were sat in the lounge while the maintenance team attended o the lock. By this time the bar was shut and we were offered no refreshments. At 1:30am we finally gained access to our room with no apology from the team. On our checkout we were asked if everything was good. We explained about being locked out and again we were offered no apology. We were very disappointed as the hotel was beautiful and the bar was great.",2,2022,03,22
115,Excellent stay at the Bloomsbury,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury for our wedding anniversary.  The whole experience was fantastic from the moment we entered to the moment we left.  The hotel is super stylish, with a 1920's feel.  The service was impeccable and every member of staff was warm and helpful without any stuffiness.  If you like 5* service and facilities but without any of the corporate stuffiness or snobbery that goes with many other hotels the Bloomsbury is for you.",5,2022,03,22

You feel cared for.  I love the dressing gowns and slippers.  You are waited upon at breakfast and there is also a buffet including fresh fruit and juices.
The main lounge is relaxing with a log fire which is an ideal place to take the weight off your feet after wandering around London.  It is a lovely hotel.",5,2022,03,14
115,Dreamy little stay in central London,"We’re staying at the Bloomsbury as I write this and having the loveliest stay- I’m so glad we opted for this choice among all the others we looked at in London. My boyfriend and I- mid-30s- are here with his parents- mid-60s—-and the vibe is appropriate for all of us. 

The staff has been so welcoming and have gone out of their way to help us, from the bellhops who raced down the stairs to take our luggage when we rolled up to the front door, to the brunette woman who checked us in, to  our young blonde waiter (didn’t catch his name) in the stunning hotel bar, to Estetita and Mary, who attentively took care of us at breakfast. 

Rooms are cozy and well-appointed, and housekeeping has been perfect. The decor in the common areas is quirky and classy, and the location can’t be beat- centrally located and easy to walk to all of the restaurants and shopping in Soho. We haven’t hit their tea room yet but it looks dreamy- covered in flowers! We’d gladly stay here again and recommend it to others.",5,2022,03,13

From the onset the welcome is warm & friendly.  The staff are truly first class, throughout. It feels like being part of a family. The rooms are tastefully & stylishly decorated, very comfortable & immaculate.  A Nespresso coffee maker, luxurious gowns & slippers, and great toiletries.  I cannot praise the staff enough, Sebastian, you have a fantastic team that clearly love their work and who they work for (Doyle group)!, Ivan - who always like Sebastian, go out of their way to make our stay as perfect as possible,  Marcella, all at reception are incredibly welcoming and friendly.  As soon as  the door is opened for you, you are greeted with a smile and a welcome (back in our case).  We had a fabulous suite, wish we could have stayed longer!  After our night out we went downstairs to The Bloomsbury Club, saw a really exciting and talented band and drank the perfect brandy Alexanders, thanks to Diego, who under the auspices of Tibor and his staff run a smooth operation.  Cannot mention the gorgeous Coral Room, we had freshly made scones and a glass of a great english fizz, Rathfinny Estate sparkling, found in only a few bars in London.  We were introduced to this delicious and french comparable fizz by the very efficient bar and restaurant Manager Georgi, another staff member that excels at his job.  And to miss the breakfast her would be a mistake!  Excellent choices of delicious food, served by again, friendly and efficient staff, thank you Maria, Esmelita, Maria, Hussein et al. We met the  new GM, Susanne Traudt, who is also really friendly, engaging and utterly professional.  Not sure how she can improve on an already great hotel, but look forward to making more great memories here, my oasis of calm and perfection, The Bloomsbury.",5,2022,03,02

What a pleasure it is to stay in an hotel where everybody is cheerful and happy. We stayed last weekend in a suite, totally luxurious! but have stayed before in the entry level rooms which are superb.
The manager, Sebastian was fabulous. Nothing is too much trouble for him. The reception staff are fantastic especially Marcela and Ivan who has been promoted from Doorman to a much more responsible job as a concierge. A certain sign that the management at The Bloomsbury promote from within the organisation and reward hard work and diligence. 
The Dalloway Terrace is a great place to eat in central London. It is quiet, very comfortable and refined and has a very comprehensive menu to suit all times and occasions. The manager, Georgi, is also in charge of the famous Coral Room cocktail bar. He definitely made our stay this time. Pointing out some great bubbles which are produced in England. The sparkling wine which he chose for us is Rathfinny Classic Cuvee 2018. It's an exceptional English sparkling wine produced in Sussex and has had many great reviews from wine critics and drinkers alike. 
To illustrate the quality of service, we decided to have a glass before leaving for home on Sunday. We had eaten a superb breakfast under the watchful eyes of Maria and Esmalita and weren't particularly hungry but it was 1.30 and we were peckish. Georgi suggested scones with cream and raspberry jam. It was heavenly and we a second helping to speed us on our way home.
There is a fabulous ""club"" downstairs on the lower ground floor called The Bloomsbury Club Bar. The drinks, especially for us, the Brandy Alexanders are superb. There is often live music and the 3 man band who were playing on Saturday night were brilliant. We were greatly entertained and served by Diego who was better than special in looking after us
Finally, I must mention that the hotel has a new General Manager, Susanne Traudt who we met and found to be very professional, energetic and friendly. I am sure she will bring a distinctive, creative twist to what is already near perfection.",5,2022,02,28
115,Fabulous!,"My husband and I stayed here for one night to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. From the moment we walked up the steps, until we left, the service was absolutely first class. Every single member of staff went above and beyond to be warm, friendly and interested in us, even if we just ran into them in passing. 
The hotel is gorgeous. Our room was upgraded and there was an anniversary card and some macarons in our room. We had wonderful cocktails in the Coral Room and were given a complimentary glass of champagne to celebrate, which completely took us by surprise. At breakfast, we were looked after by Mary, who was a delight! I so hope we have the opportunity to stay here again. I can’t recommend the hotel enough.",5,2022,02,27
115,Highly Recommend,"Just had a night at The Bloomsbury. Great location, fantastic cocktail bar and superb service. The staff could not have been more friendly, professional or helpful. Comfortable room and excellent breakfast. Highly recommend.",5,2022,02,27
115,Perfect London Stay,"A beautiful hotel just on the edge of Covent Garden, 
Super service, friendly and attentive.  A vibrant atmosphere but certainly not loud in any way.  The room was amongst the best we have ever stayed in.  Comfortable and welcoming. Everything was simply perfect.",5,2022,02,26
115,Great hotel that punches way above its price point,"Good quality everything, outstanding service (and great pillows and bedroom appointments) in a central but quiet location.  Elegant but not stuffy, relaxed but not slack in any way, good value.  Warm and lovely staff.",5,2022,02,26
115,"Fantastic visit, superior service","The location of the hotel is great, but what sets it apart is the service.  Maria, Estelita, and Victor were particularly helpful every morning at breakfast and made our stay that much more enjoyable for our family.  Heated floors in the bathroom were an extra nice touch as well.",5,2022,02,25
115,A Wonderful Experience,"My daughter and myself stayed for 1 night at this beautiful hotel. The staff were so friendly, kind and helpful. The room was spacious, clean and tastefully decorated. The bedlinen smelt so clean and the bed was super comfortable.  I highly recommend you stay here!",5,2022,02,23
115,A great place to stay in London,"Our recent visit for a two night stay in The Bloomsbury hotel was superb.
Without exception the staff in that hotel made our stay there a great experience.
They were helpful, provided guidance where appropriate and really went out of their way to ensure that the guests had the best possible time during their stay.
The bedroom was very comfortable and quiet and well fitted out. We went on several occasions to The Coral Bar and enjoyed comfortable drinks with excellent service.
We ate in the Dalloway Terrace restaurant and once again the service the food and drink were first class.
This was a first class experience from start to finish and I can highly recommend it to others.",5,2022,02,22
115,Family weekend,"Loved the experience.
The staff were very attentive.  Room was excellent.  Food fantastic.
It has a great location , central but quiet.  We walked into Covent Garden, Leicester Square.
We will certainly stay again.",5,2022,02,21
115,Fabulous with exceptional service,"Stayed for one night and couldn’t have been happier with the service. 
Food and drinks were a little pricey but that was to be expected and the standard of all our meals and cocktails was excellent. One small area for improvement is the non-alcoholic beer turned out to be 2.5% abv and shouldn’t really be on that section of the menu as this was misleading. 
Breakfast was truly delicious and delivered quickly to our room which was also lovely. 
Try the coral bar and the Bloomsbury bar downstairs for live music and late night cocktails",5,2022,02,20
115,A wedding anniversary stay,"It was an excellent stay - from the welcome at the front door to our departure after a delicious breakfast with friends in the Bloomsbury Club dining room.  A special mention and thank you  to Jonathan, on the front desk - about his brilliant customer service skills.  He masterminded an upgrade to a larger room on his own initiative, offered excellent customer service skills and is a credit to the hotel.  Well done and see you on our return,",5,2022,02,20
115,Anazing hotel,"Amazing hotel!!! Great service, close to Qxford and Soho, good breakfast, really nice bar  with good vibes. There was q really nice guy at the reception named Ivan that helped us a lot with everything including buying tickets to madam tusso,  harry poter studios atc. ",5,2022,02,19
115,The most wonderful hotel. A jewel in Londons crown!,"Just returned from another visit to this fabulous hotel. Cannot fault anything about it! Great location, spotless, the most best staff I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. Love The Coral Room & eating on The Dalloway Terrace.

115,"Well looked after, excellent staff, quality accomodation and facilities.","We really enjoyed our 2 day break which was so restful and enjoyable from start to finish.

Great staff, attentive and thoughtful. 

A peaceful stay so close  to the  centre of London with an excellent room, a comfortable bed and quality facilities.",5,2022,02,15
115,Mrs Harris,"Overall everything was excellent the staff, the service, the food and ambience will definitely be returning. It’s like a little gem hidden within London. The decor was warm and inviting, would highly suggest to anyone wanting to stay and explore London but also want to run away from the hustle and bustle of the city. ",5,2022,02,15
115,Top class from beginning to end,"Staff were all so welcoming.  Concierge team, led by Brian went out of their way to make it easy for us, with good suggestions on dining. Decor lovely.  Room quiet and very comfortable. And location is great for easy access to museums, theatres and the tube.  This hotel gets everything right - and knocks the socks off many other hotels in London we have visited.",5,2022,02,11
115,Wonderful birthday stay,"We enjoyed a 2-night London break in the heart of the city. Best location, best service and best design. Beautiful intimate hotel that does not disappoint. Exceptional customer service.

The coral room was a highlight with stunning cocktails. A great location for a first date if we want to impress. For a proposal, book the gorgeous garden room for afternoon tea. ",5,2022,02,09
115,The Bloomsbury,Whole experience was 10/10. All the staff were so lovely and made our stay so enjoyable. Would absolutely stay here again. It’s so central and in walking distance of all the tourist spots. A very pleasant trip,5,2022,02,06
115,"The most comfortable stay in London, UK","I stayed for a whole week for a business trip and meeting for a large group. Marcela is such a wonderful front of house person. She is just very quick with anticipating and actioning queries or requests. The F&B was always amazing with Maria, Estrelita, Mary, Patricia, Florin, Veronica and Huseyin's warm hospitality. Brian and Ivan just knew all the secret spots and ins and outs of London. Samir, Sebastian, Safiya and Francisco were so helpful with all the assistance I asked for and no task was too small or too big. Ivo, Jack, Sam just really looked after evening meals and drinks at Dalloway Terrace and Coral Room. Leo created this bespoke Mai Tai cocktail for us which was dangerously more-ish! Lia and Nikoletta of course who coordinates events were always nearby to assist.

As you can see I got to know the staff because they also made a great effort to know us. I don't think I've ever dealt with such lovely staff in any hotel. They are all just willing to go the extra mile for the guests and I must say, I will be happy to keep coming back. Very central convenient location and spotlessly clean. Such a memorable stay!",5,2022,02,04
115,Delightful hotel in a fabulous location,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury for a special birthday celebration. From the moment we arrived, the staff  anticipated our every need. Our room was wonderful. 
The Coral Room is a chic yet cosy bar for delicious cocktails, and we had supper in the Dalloway Terrace. The Dorset crab with their Guinness soda bread was superb. 
Breakfast the next morning featured my favourite, eggs Benedict , which came with a little pot of extra hollandaise-very decadent! Throughout our visit staff were so professional and helpful. Diego very ably served us in the bar, Shakira and Matt were amazing in the Dalloway; although the restaurant was fully booked, they looked after every guest as if they were the only ones there. The super service from them made a special visit unforgettable.",5,2022,01,31
115,Friendliest staff in London,"Visited this fabulous hotel during a trip to the Capital. On arrival we were greeted by the wonderful Marcela. She was so friendly and welcoming. What a great start to our holiday. During our stay the General Manager and his deputy Marta visited us and spent time talking despite their very busy schedule. The breakfast team was looked after by Maria who was assisted by Espolita, Hussein and Patricia. Food is amazing and it caters for all tastes. At night in the bar John, John and Sam were superb, continually asking if they could be of any assistance. The rooms are spacious and well looked after by the caring housekeeping staff.  All those I have mentioned are amazing ambassadors for the company. Will be back for sure.",5,2022,01,28
115,Wonderful stay,"We just had a short stay at the Bloomsbury and we loved it. We first selected it for its great location as it is a short walk from a Oxford street shops, Charlotte street restaurants, a variety of theaters, the British Museum and other landmark locations.

The building itself looks stylish. The team at the reception was very welcoming and made the check-in a swift process. Our room was beautiful and the hotel even made the effort to set a toy tent with child amenities for our little one. She loved it. The bathroom was also very stylish with marble wall and floor.

We had an early drink in the Coral bar. The cocktails presentations very creative and tasted delicious. We then moved to the Dalloway terrace for dinner. It is a covered and heated terrace near the main entrance. The menu was very varied and our dishes were all excellent. 

The morning breakfast was equally good and diverse. We finished our stay with an afternoon tea by the lovely warm fireplace of the property. We'll go again soon! ",5,2022,01,23
115,A gorgeous Art Deco hotel in the heart of historic Bloomsbury,"Having not visited the Bloomsbury for almost a year, it really felt like a fabulous homecoming, returning to see so many familiar faces from Sebastian in Front Office, to Georgi on Dalloway Terrace and of course Michael Neve, arguably the most hospitable GM I have ever encountered, and a real asset to The Doyle Collection - a luxury family owned hotel group. We stayed in a studio suite for 3 nights including my birthday and the experience was faultless, the room was so well appointed with Dyson hair dryer, big smart TV, roll-top bath and elegant design throughout, the team helped my partner set the room and it felt really special. The Coral Room was abuzz with a great vibe and energy - the whole place feels like an oasis of charm in actually a really convenient part of town. We cannot wait to return.",5,2022,01,18
115,First stay at the Bloomsbury,"On arrival Johnathon helped with my bags.Checked in by Roxane & Marcela.Very clean room.Coral room served by Diego, in the Bloomsbury room,Tibor served.Great breakfast.Checked out by Roni.Perfect stay",5,2022,01,14
115,daughters seventh birthday,"another lovely stay at the bloomsbury. a gorgeous hotel with a great location but what really makes it special is the staff. they were great with my daughter, making such a fuss for her birthday, she loved it. particular thanks to ivan the concierge, who was so helpful with directions and recommendations. thanks all.",5,2022,01,12
115,Amazing Weekend,Upon arrival we were greeted by Ivan who took out cases and sent them to our room. Marcela and Roxanne Booked us in and gave us all the information we needed for our stay. The room was amazing and had everything that we needed. In the evening we went to the Coral Room where we were very well looked after by Georgi. We then went downstairs to the Bloomsbury Bar and were treated like royalty but Diego. In the morning the breakfast was delicious. We were checked out by Roni. We had the most amazing stay and the hotel staffed really did the make the stay special and effortless,5,2022,01,12
115,Gem of a hotel,"Good locatioin for Covent Garden etc, friendly service in a smaller hotel where you feel like a guest in a country house. The rooms are opulent and the Coral Bar, particularly, is a fine location for a cocktail or two ",5,2022,01,10
115,Fantastic London hotel,"We’ve stayed at The Bloomsbury numerous times and we’ve never been disappointed. We received a genuinely warm welcome from the reception team which was matched by the dining room staff at breakfast. Our room was very clean and well appointed as is the entire hotel. Despite its central location the hotel is quiet at night with very minimal traffic noise. Ideally situated for Oxford Street, Soho and Covent Garden. Highly recommended.",5,2022,01,02
115,Disappointing second visit,"This was our second visit after a wonderful stay the first time in December 2019.
We love the location, the style of the hotel and the Coral room is a big favourite.
Unfortunately, this second visit did not live up to the last time. 
For the price we paid for our stay, we expect it all to be top class. 
However, on this occasion, the issues we had included the underfloor heating in the bathroom being too hot without any way to turn it down. 
The air con also was not working so the room became uncomfortable during the night. 
Lastly, there was a very large screen tv in the room which looked great. Unfortunately the signal/reception on it was so poor that the majority of channels were unwatchable. 
Really disappointed",2,2021,12,19
115,Excellent Hotel,"Fabulous hotel. Great location, fabulous service, comfortable rooms, and excellent bar area. My family and I truly enjoyed our stay at the Bloomsbury.  Strongly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London and who enjoy staying at what I would consider a Boutique Hotel. Everything is first class, with ought the opulence or larger crowds found at larger hotels. Special thanks to the wonderful staff, especially those in the reception area and bell captains.",5,2021,12,15
115,Excellent position,"I spent one night in London and already. I can't wait to go back. I  recommend the abergo to those are unfamiliar with the city. It is close to my favorite neighborhoods Soho and Covent Garden and the Tottenham Court Road tube station, so you can get anywhere from there. The hotel is really nice and the rooms pure even if perhaps in our ""Superior Room Queen Bed"" the bathroom was a bit small but still very clean!",5,2021,12,14
115,Sam made our day!,"Myself, my daughter, and her godmother went to the Bloomsbury for afternoon tea today.  What an absolute treat!  The tea was delicious and exquisitely served by the lovely Sam Carter, who looked after us impeccably, even to the point where he was prepared to take us round the building to look at the library and chapel.  Amazing building, amazing tea, and amazing service.  Well done Sam, and a happy Xmas to all the staff at the Bloomsbury.  We will be back.",5,2021,12,13
115,Birthday London treat,"Had a lovely stay with my two daughters for one of their birthdays. The room was lovely my only criticism would be some of the carpet was frayed in a couple of places and when you are paying top money you want it to look perfect.

The staff were exceptional. Very attentive polite and helpful. When we came back to the room from the theatre there were 2 teddy bears on the bed and a lovely note which they were thrilled with. The food was lovely and location ideal. Would highly recommend.",5,2021,12,13
115,Early Christmas Visit to London - The perfect place to stay!,"Our family stayed at The Bloomsbury for a trip in to London to do some Christmas Shopping and a Theatre Trip.  The welcome at the hotel was second to none, all the staff were extremely welcoming, friendly and helpful.  Special note to Brian the Concierge who really made a fuss of our son and made him feel very special.

The room itself was lovely, extremely comfortable beds and even though there was a communal area just down the hallway there was no noise to be heard from it even when there were people in there utilising the facility.

My only small areas of feedback would be that the bathroom sink surface has some small damage and some staining around the taps which could have been fixed and I would have liked to see more Tea/Milk provided in the room - although it was not a problem for reception when I requested some more.

During our stay the staff were extremely helpful with directions around London to the places we were going and never to busy to arrange Taxis immediately for us.

Upon departure Brian very kindly arranged for us to take our luggage to a sister hotel near the National History Museum to save us travelling back across the city to collect luggage before out train departure later that day.

Overall an excellent experience and we will 100% be using the Doyle Group again for our next trip to London.

Thank you for a great experience whilst staying with you.",5,2021,12,11
115,December trip to The Bloomsbury,"I really liked the head concierge Brian. He was friendly, helpful and really looked after us. The bed was super comfy. The bathroom wasn’t as nice as I thought it would be from the pictures online, but it was still nice. The staff there where really helpful and friendly. I really enjoyed my stay.",4,2021,12,09
115,Beautiful hotel in the perfect location,"Fabulous hotel where the attention to detail is second to none. The literary theme and reflection of the history of the location in beautifully realised in every detail from the 'do not disturb' do hanger to the decor. The perfect location for central London with amazing staff and all the comforts, you are on the doorstep of Covent Garden and Oxford Street, and about 5 minutes from the British Museum. Gloriously comfortable beds, luxurious bathrooms. Everything has been thought of right down to padded silk hangers in the wardrobe. Cannot recommend it highly enough! 
",5,2021,12,09
115,Highly reccomend.,"Stayed here at the end of november as a winter ttreat for me and my husband. This hotel did not dissapoint in every aspect, Staff very atentive, spotless everywhere, decor outstanding and food beautiful. A real luxury and super special.",5,2021,12,06
115,This hotel is the perfect London-ey type experience.,This was a wonderfully located little jewel of a hotel. Service was overall quite amazing and it has a great restaurant and little cool basement jazz lounge with truly interesting cocktails. The Coral Room is beautiful and vibe-y. Beds are super comfortable and you are treated to an amazing English breakfast each morning - and it stays open to 11 am in case you want to sleep in a little. Loved it. Would return again for sure. ,5,2021,12,06
115,"Great hotel, great location","Lovely hotel! nice clean rooms, rich breakfast, friendly and helpful staff. Location is great- right on the underground station and close to the British museum at Soho. Our room was very big and clean and overall experience was great.",5,2021,12,04
115,Great cocktail bar,We had just one night. The staff were brilliant and the Coral room cocktail bar was just a lovely place to spend a few hours. Our room was a good size and the bed was super comfortable. Great location also. ,4,2021,11,30
115,Great Staff and Breakfast,My wife and I had a great stay recently at the Bloomsbury.  The staff were excellent.  The morning breakfast is wonderful and a great value.  Estelita and Maria provide top notch service with a friendly touch.  The concierge found us a taxi in the middle of a transit strike too!  We always felt very comfortable and secure with their ready help available.,5,2021,11,29
115,Wonderful to be back in our favourite London Hotel,"Annual Mother and Daughter Christmas shopping weekend. Beautiful Hotel and extremely well placed to explore London.  Feels like a little oasis the minute you walk through the doors. Nothing too much trouble for their guest. 3rd return visit, wouldn't go anywhere else",5,2021,11,29
115,The best hotel we have ever stayed at.,"We came to London to celebrate my Fiancé’s birthday as well as got engaged on our trip and the staff at The Bloomsbury went the extra mile for both! Champagne, cocktails, macaroons, and not to mention the exceptional levels of service we received. The food was also amazing there and afternoon tea on the Terrance is 10/10 recommended. Also the area was perfect for traveling around London and seeing all of the sights. If you’re going to London and looking for an incredible hotel experience, you must stay here.",5,2021,11,25
115,disappointment,"I'd booked a deluxe room so didn't expect an attic room with 2 small velux windows and sloping ceilings, it was a treat for my partners birthday and I knew he wouldn't want me to make a fuss but it was a huge disappointment when we saw the room ",3,2021,11,25
115,Absolutely brilliant,"Absolutely everything was perfect. The location, the room, the food... Shout out to Brian, the Concierge - he was absolutely brilliant. He had amazing dinner recommendations, and booked everything for us. Maria, one of the waitresses in the Coral Bar, was a pleasure to see and chat to every day. Everyone was just so friendly. Exceeded my expectations. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2021,11,24
115,Beautiful hotel and perfect service,"A beautiful, well-located hotel with first class service. Particular mentions to the reception staff, Sebastian and Marcella, the superb bard staff George and Dennis and the extremely helpful breakfast service from Estelita and Mary.

115,Magnificent,"We recently stayed for a couple of nights at The Bloomsbury. Our experience was exceptional for all of the right reasons. The staff were professional, courteous and friendly from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. The room was beyond expectations and the quality of food was excellent. We enjoyed an afternoon cream tea and the cocktails before bedtime were amazing. The hotels location made easy access to the heart of London. A really great stay. We would totally recommend this Hotel. Well done to The Bloomsbury. We will be back. ",5,2021,11,20
115,The best breakfast in Central London!,"Lovely staff and the best tasting full English breakfast I've ever had. My colleague had a very beautiful avocado on toast. The coffee was amazing. Shout out to Mary, Maria and Estrelita (F&B) The service and food is second to none from reservations (Ricardo) and concierge (Ivan) You have to stay and eat here!!!!!",5,2021,11,19
115,Bloomsbury Stay,Warm friendly staff. Awesome breakfast - nearest off meter parking  some 10 min walk although there is a pick-up and drop off point. Clean odour free room. Comfortable bed gave a relaxing nights sleep. I would return.,4,2021,11,19
115,Beautiful but TINY,"I live in NYC and I'm used to small rooms but this was tiny -- and we were upgraded! I wanted to love this hotel as the common space interiors are gorgeous, but at the end of the day the place where I was sleeping, showering and spending most of my time while at the hotel was lacking. 

Perhaps if the rooms were better designed it would have been fine. However, if you have a room that small and guests paying over $600 a night every centimeter needs to be considered. It's an old hotel and I'm sure there are slight variations in all the rooms; if adjustments were made to each to optimize it would have helped tremendously. 

There was no dresser but plenty of room to have one and have it serve as the nightstand adjacent to the bed -- instead a tiny nightstand there (which I assume is all that fits in the room of the lesser category) with 2' of breathing room to the wall did little beside hold a lamp. Then bench for bags could have been twice the size it was ... instead I was one the floor going through my bag as I gave my husband the bench.

The bathroom was not well designed either. I love a tub, but there isn't room for one in the space and it was would have been better to have a good shower than the tub/ shower in the room that did neither well. The tub slopes so the standing room in the shower is tight. The glass partition was ridiculous .... like water world in the bathroom after every shower you take.

Staff was very nice but it would have been helpful if they reminded us of the credit that came with our room (I had to look it up) and about breakfast each morning. On day 1 we didn't go to breakfast; if I had realized it was included in our rate, I might have.  Again, no real issues with the staff they were very courteous and helpful overall.",3,2021,11,15
115,Lovely Stay,"Great hotel with Good sized rooms. Cool bar. Breakfast is 10/10 for a hotel. Maria, Mary, victor, and Estelita we’re amazing. Will be staying here again next time in London. The location is perfectly central and the staff were great.",5,2021,11,14
115,"High class hotel, high class employees.","Wow, this is a quality hotel. From when we arrived till our check out the next day, you felt valued. Really cool bar ‘The Coral Room’ for your pre dinner drinks, then to the ‘Dalloway’  restaurant for a great varied menu. Special mention to a lady called Gunilla, who made us so welcome. 

Barman David and manager Gio. also deserve a mention.

It ain’t cheap, but you pay for what you get!",5,2021,11,12
115,Its fine but there is better hotels in the area,"Staff - Can be a bit off with you sometimes, e.g. sitting you at a table and trying to order drinks... they can completely ignore you. The box rooms are quite stuffy, ring ahead to ensure don't get stuck with one. ",2,2021,11,12
115,Hotel recommendation,"Location is good. Rooms very good.

All the hotel staff was excellent and helpful and cordial.",5,2021,11,11
115,Simply the best,"I cannot recommend this hotel more highly. Everyone here - from the breakfast team, the bartenders, wait staff, front desk, concierges - they are a really special group. I’ve been coming here for years and can’t imagine staying anywhere else. Truly extraordinary service and commitment to their guests.",5,2021,11,08
115,Genuinely lovely,"Ivan the concierge right from the very beginning was so warm and helpful which was foreshadowing for all of our interactions to come. Lovely and nice bar staff at the Coral Bar, cheerful service at our complimentary breakfast, honestly it was delightful as it felt like people enjoyed working at the hotel. 

We had a suite, and I have a very soft spot for a claw-footed bathtub, I was in R&R heaven. Malin+Goetz products really took the pampering to the next level. I would absolutely recommend staying here",5,2021,11,07
115,Amazing stay,"Excellent accommodation with extremely attentive staff. Maria and Victor were superb from the moment we arrived. 
Great location for central London with everywhere within walking distance. 
Hotel was spotlessly clean and felt very safe.

115,The Fabulous Bloomsbury,"After reading so many positive reviews of this hotel we had high expectations. We were not disappointed! Upon check in we were made to feel very welcome and we were very happy with our comfortable and stylish room. The lounge by reception was lovely and cosy and the Coral Bar for evening cocktails was gorgeous. We found all the staff to be friendly and attentive and the lovely Maria and her team served us an excellent breakfast.
Overall, it was just wonderful to go back to the elegant and welcoming Bloomsbury after the hustle and bustle of London. We loved every minute of our 2 night stay there and hope to return one day.",5,2021,11,06
115,fantastic hotel,"the hotel is situated in a quiet area close to the british museum

all the staff where very friendly but i must mention two members of staff that stood out .francesco who greeted us on our way in and out of the hotel several times , he always had a smile and lola who checked us out .she was very polite and professional .highly recommend the bloomsbury",5,2021,11,03
115,Marvelous,"Courteous and inviting service, strive to respond to every request and question.
The service providers are nice and welcoming.
The stylish and elegant lobby gives a feeling of warmth, coziness and quiet to sit in. High-class design with intimate seating areas.
The room is very spacious and modern. The atmosphere is warm and gives a homely, comfortable feeling. Excellent lighting and suitable for any need.
The bathroom is spacious and pleasant to stay in.
A point to consider - there are not enough drawers or shelves in the closet to put clothes for those who come for more than two or three days.
The food and cocktails on the DALLOWAY TERRACE are of a high standard. Everything is refined, interesting, different, delicious, and served in a beautiful way.
Breakfast is expensive and does not justify the price. Pretty basic for a hotel of this level. If you are interested in the addition you must pay extra.
Location - Ideal for shows and shopping. This is a great starting point for traveling both on foot and by TUBE (Central and Northern lines).
Thank you for the amazing hospitality.",5,2021,11,03
115,Great staff,"We had a great stay during our time at the Bloomsbury hotel in London! Thank you for the great service from the excellent staff  ! Nick , Victor, Estelita and Maria ! We will definitely be back!  From the McCormack Family",5,2021,10,31
115,1st weekend break after Covid!! ,We spent 2 nights at The Bloomsbury and have had an amazing time 😍The staff have been so friendly and helpful even though they have been really busy. The room we stayed in was fantastic and we had the best sleep we have had in ages - we can't wait to come back again! ,5,2021,10,30
115,Excellent hotel and  service,"I spent a week at the hotel for work and the experience was flawless. The hotel is beautiful, food excellent and staff went to every length to make sure I had the best, most personalised experience possible. Maria and Mary in at breakfast were especially diligent and took care of my every need, greeting me with a smile every morning.",5,2021,10,28
115,The is a great hotel in a great location with a great staff.,"Hubby and I just returned from the UK, and we spent 7 nights at the Bloomsbury.  It was delightful and the location was superb.  The staff knew us by name, and genuinely seemed to care about us.  The hotel was immaculate and Covid clean, and breakfast was the best of all of the breakfasts at the 5 places we stayed on our 21-day trip.  Especially pleasant were Maria, Victor and Hussein who greeted us each morning for breakfast and helped accommodate our dietary needs and preferences.  The concierge was so pleasant and the front desk staff were fabulous in helping us with our many questions.  The rooms were well maintained, too.  The only reason that I am not giving this hotel a 5 is that the furniture in our room was large and clunky, which took up valuable space.  The desk was huge and the desk chair would not scoot under the desk.  One bedside table was large and round, and the the side chair was too big.  The closet doors opened out into the room and consumed more space.  For many people, this would not be an issue, but we like space and were there for 7 days.  It was hard for us to both move about the room simulataneously as the furniture across from our bed stuck out too far, obscuring a clear pathway.  Perhaps if we have stayed in a larger room, we would not have had this issue.  But London is pricey and The Bloomsbury is no exception.  We have no regrets staying there - it is simply a lovely hotel in so many ways - and close to the tube and the lovely Covent Garden area.",4,2021,10,27
115,Outstanding!,"We had a fantastic weekend for our 18th Wedding Anniversary. Lovely hotel. Very attentive staff. The rooms were immaculate with everything you could possible require for a weekend away should you need. Comfortable bed, and high quality linen. Breakfast was excellent, breakfast team were very attentive to all your needs, remembering your name. Nice relaxed atmosphere. Prime location, we visited Ronnie Scotts Jazz Club which was a 5-10 minute walk, lots of bistro’s, cafés & bars. Soho, Carnaby, Oxford & Regent Street. Close to West End Theatres, what more could you want! Perfect location. Thank you to all at the Bloomsbury for a magical weekend.",5,2021,10,27
115,Lovely hotel in a great location,"This was our second visit, the first being beginning March 2020. It is a very comfortable hotel with friendly and efficient staff at every level. The breakfast and lunch are high quality. We like the Coral Room and the bar has a wide range of drinks.
We stayed one night in a classic room with a very comfortable bed. The room is small but fine of you don't have much luggage or many clothes to hang up. It has all the facilities of the larger rooms (robes, tea and coffee making etc) and complimentary sanitised and hand wipes!
Great location for walking to the British Museum, Covent Garden and even Euston.

My only criticism is that guests should be able to order in a newspaper. There is a newsagent very near. The reason given was cutting down on paper and you can read for free on your phone. I could understand if the hotel was cutting back on giving out free newspapers that might not be needed but not if you order one especially.",5,2021,10,25
115,Business trip with home away from home experience,"While I stayed in the Bloomsbury for a few days on business in London, I have to say that the friendliness and welcoming of the staff made my stay feel more like a home away from home experience. The library is lovely to sit and read in too! The staff are just amazing from attentiveness at breakfast through to recommending amazing dinner dishes in both the Coral Bar and the Dalloway Terrace - thanks guys!!",5,2021,10,25
115,Lovely hotel in a great location,We stayed for one night to celebrate our 10 year anniversary and we absolutely loved this hotel. The decor was exactly to our liking and the staff were very polite and welcoming. Would 100% recommend this hotel. Thank you for making it a truly wonderful experience.,5,2021,10,24
115,Elegant hotel  and welcoming staff.,"From the moment the bellhop came down the stairs for my luggage , my experience was wonderful.  The room was comfortable and updated. A desk light had burned out and within 10 minutes of calling there was a knock on my door with a replacement.  The lighting on the bed was great. 
I had to leave early the next day, missing breakfast, so I asked if I could get some fruit and a breakfast pastry.  A lovely box was waiting the next morning. I was able to enjoy my breakfast on the way to the airport.",5,2021,10,21
115,Superb experience - highly recommend,"Bloomsbury Hotel - lovely quiet location and very nice settings.

Had a fantastic stay, very friendly staff and comfortable rooms. If you get the chance go for the breakfast - it was superb and the services was amazing.

115,Lovely stay,"Stayed at The Bloomsbury Hotel for 2 nights over the weekend with my Mam. This was our annual stay at the hotel, and they never fail to make you feel special. 2 complimentary cocktails in the coral room for my mams birthday,  macaroons and a card for returning customers.  Attentive staff at breakfast, especially Maria, who always seems to recognise us, knows what we want and greets us by name. Such a lovely lady. Fabulous food for breakfast. No vegetarian sausages but chef was happy to make a veggie breakfast. Amazing omelette. Looking forward to returning next year 😀 💕💕💕",4,2021,10,19
115,Birthday suprise,"Just leaving a 2 night stay at the bloomsbury,  what a great London hotel , great location,  smashing comfortable and quiet room , we enjoyed a meal in the delaway terrace. So pretty, drinks in the coral bar,  ....but we must say a massive thank you to the staff, on reception ....samir and   morcela, nothing was too much trouble ,polite,  friendly and super efficient,

115,Weekend birthday treat,"We went to london for my wife's birthday. An excellent hotel. Location and service top of the charts. We had a thoroughly great time. All within easy walking distance: Caught a show at the adelphi theatre, shopping, meals in Coventry garden garden soho, national museum, etc,etc.",5,2021,10,19
115,Work Drinks,We had a great evening at the Bloomsbury Club Bar! The venue was beautiful and everyone commented on how lovely it was. Cristina and Nicu were great at getting things set up for us and for making sure we had a nice time. Thank you!,4,2021,10,18
115,Theatre break at The Bloomsbury,Breakfast was lovely and service good from Maria and Victor. The building is a beautiful art deco type with fabulous decor in the public areas and bars. The location was great for the the theatre and shops. It was very quiet at night and the bed very comfortable with good linen.,4,2021,10,17
115,Fantastic hotel,"First time (although I often stay at their sister hotel, The Westbury, in Dublin). Loved everything about The Bloomsbury. Central location, lovely appointed rooms, right boutique size, terrific restaurant and outside terrace. Very good price point for London. Rare to spend 10 days in the same hotel and not be tired of it, but i wasn't. Concierge and front desk very helpful. Special shout-out to the ladies of the breakfast room - Maria Victor, Estilita and Mary, and to Mary on the housekeeping staff who went out of their way to be welcoming and helpful. Look forward to returning soon.",5,2021,10,15
115,I knew I'd be here again!!!,"I visited the Bloomsbury about two years ago and wrote this review: 
https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d209229-r668314522-The_Bloomsbury-London_England.html

I said that I couldn't wait to visit again and thankfully I was able to do so and I was of course so very happy !!  

Everything about this hotel is first class, and it goes from top down to everyone and everything involoved.

First, before arrival, I had a package shipped to the hotel and I was assured that it would wait for me and not only did it wait I also received confirmation by mail of its arrival.
From the moment we stepped into the hotel everyone greeted us with a smile and you could see that the entire staff is always there to make sure that you have the most pleasant stay.
For example, we had a problem with our room - it was immediately solved, by Ivan the wonderful concierge, making sure the rest of our stay was comfortable. He continued to make sure we are alright every morning and each time we saw him, greeting us with a smile and pleasantries.

The breakfast staff always greeted us with a smile, taking care of everything we needed, most especially, the two lovely Maria and Mary (and also the rest of the staff of course!), who really made sure we started our day with a good  breakfast and a great smile - which you could definitely see under the mask.

I should mention again the prime location of the hotel, the breakfast selection which is wonderful, the rooms which are spacious and comfortable bed, the wonderful amenities and this all just comes to show you that this is a top rated hotel with service that just makes you feel like you're number 1 at all times.

Will most definitely visit again!!",5,2021,10,12
115,An absolute gem of a hotel,"Fabulous long weekend at The Bloomsbury celebrating my husband’s 60th birthday!  Everything we could have wished for in terms of luxury, service, atmosphere, gorgeous breakfast and amazing cocktails!  Great location - within 5 mins walking distance of the hustle and bustle of Tottenham Court Road tube station, Oxford Street etc and located in the quiet but charming Fitzrovia!  Special shout-out to Maria, Mary, Estelita and Victor who looked after us every morning for a delicious breakfast to get the day started, to Ivan who was on hand all day…nothing was too much trouble and helped make my husband’s birthday a special one and of course to Dennis in The Coral Room for his absolutely awesome cocktails each evening….the best Rum Old Fashioned ever and of course, not to forget the Garden Party and Old Cuban’s.  Thank you to everyone at The Bloomsbury for a wonderful weekend!",5,2021,10,11
115,"Friendly, Professional & Boutique stay","Our time at the hotel was memorable for all the right reasons. 
Rooms were luxurious, bed very comfortable, room service above and beyond,  the staff very friendly and the coral bar had a great vibe & atmosphere. 

Estelita, Maria & Victor we’re so helpful, professional, friendly and nothing seemed too much during our delicious breakfast service. 
A real credit to the hotel!!",5,2021,10,10
115,A lovely hotel,"We have stayed many times at the Bloomsbury and would recommend it for its position, atmosphere and generally good customer service. The breakfast room staff are particularly worthy of a mention; they are so customer-focussed and helpful. The only thing that lets the hotel down is the bar. We have had previous problems with slow service and getting the wrong drinks but this time we couldn't get a drink at all as we didn't have a reservation. The person in charge of the bar was not interested in trying to resolve this and we certainly won't be going to the bar next time we stay at the hotel. Had it not been for that we would have given the hotel a five star rating for service, so don't be put off as everything else is well up to standard",4,2021,10,10
115,Not bad in the end,"We stayed here to celebrate our tenth wedding anniversary. I booked a Deluxe double at about £400 a night. When we arrived at the hotel we were both extremely disappointed with the quality of the room. Although a decent size, the decor was dated and tatty, and the bathroom of extremely poor quality. There were fake plastic flowers on the window CIL. If this had been £290, I would have been disappointed. We saw two other Deluxe double rooms, both of which were equally poor. We eventually decided that the room was so poor that we should upgrade to a Junior Suite. In all honesty, given it was our tenth anniversary I would have anticipated an upgrade anyway, but we had to pay out another £100 a night for this room. The Junior Suite was much better. It was a goods size, but again there issues that I wouldn’t expect to see at this price point. Poor masticking and finishing in the bathroom, chipped paint in walls. 
The hotel itself is ok. The check in area is small snd underwhelming, but the bar is very nice snd cocktails excellent. The service from all staff was very good indeed. All told, an enjoyable stay, but in no way outstanding.",3,2021,10,07
115,A great hotel,"The Bloomsbury is a great place to stay, very easy to get to (a 3 minute walk from Tottenham Court Rd Tube station) and a very stylish hotel with excellent friendly and helpful staff. I look forward to my next visit.",5,2021,10,07
115,Disappointed with this 5 star hotel - service poor,"Visited here with the family in September. Was a great location, not a big imposing hotel, just down a side street, easily missed. 
Staff were lovely and the actual hotel was nice….but….rooms were small and not particularly luxurious, bar service was very poor and slow. Don’t mind paying the extortionate London prices for good service but I’m afraid there are much better places to stay, eat and drink in London. Would not recommend. Memorable for the wrong reasons. We spent  £300 on each room for  1 night !!!! Plus the expensive drinks. Was very disappointed ☹️",3,2021,10,07
115,Outstanding ,"Stayed for 2 nights to celebrate our friends birthday and our anniversary, the hotel and staff were very professional and attentive at all times ,  our rooms were comfortable, very clean and the bed was the most comfortable we have ever stayed in , The Dalloway terrace is highly recommended, food was delicious and service excellent , The Coral Room bar was equally beautiful, decor and service again outstanding. 
Breakfast was plentiful and nicely cooked with a great choice on the menu.
We will definitely be returning to The Bloomsbury, thankyou to all the staff for your warm hospitality ",5,2021,10,04
115,A quality stay in London,"Enjoyed a lovely stay in king size room, central London.  Lovely bar/restaurant areas. Easy for London sights. Reviews have to be 200 characters but what more should I say as my first two sentences cover everything.",5,2021,10,03
115,Weekend Break,"Beautiful hotel in a great location. Staff are fantastic, great cocktail bar and the food was excellent. We were impressed with the quality of the breakfast and the staff had time to chat and special mention to Maria, Estelita, Victor, Nicu and Mary. This was our first time here and will definiltely return.",5,2021,10,02
115,Perfect hotel in Bloomsbury London,"Excellent location, beautiful hotel just a minute away from the British Museum and many parks.  Beautiful setting - great bar and lovely terrace.  Walking distance to Soho, Covent Garden and an easy walk to Mayfair area (Bond St)...will definitely come back again.",4,2021,09,30
115,A very special hotel.,"A lovely hotel with a really lovely room and a huge comfortable bed. Very friendly staff and easy check in and out. The cocktail bar was gorgeous and all staff were very attentive, particularly Valentina who made us feel very welcome. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2021,09,29
115,Afternoon Tea - saved by Kenni the waiter,"Thanks to the wonderful waiter Kenni for saving the day and turning what could have been a two star review into a five star one.  I had booked afternoon tea for 5 people - including two American visitors for whom afternoon tea in London was a new experience.  I booked online from the hotel website, clicked on afternoon tea and duly booked including one vegan and one vegetarian.  On arrival at the hotel, was told quite abruptly that there was no vegan option for afternoon tea and that we were actually booked into dining. Suggest the hotel looks at how the booking process works for customers if it can incorrectly be booked like this.  Secondly, for such a good hotel it seems below par that it isn’t possible for them to provide a vegan option.  We were then told to book off the a la carte - but even here there were very limited options and ended up with a tomato salad while the rest of the party had the full afternoon tea experience.  However,  Kenni’s customer service was exceptional and he did his utmost to make up for the confusion.  All credit to him and hope his efforts are recognised by his boss!",5,2021,09,28
115,A wonderful experience,"Celebrated my husband's 50th and wasn't disappointed. Drinks in The Coral Room was the highlight for us. All the staff were lovely and very happy to accommodate. We were able to check-in early as room available.
Negatives- bed very hard, minimal toiletries",5,2021,09,27
115,Great experience in London,"Came for business and with my daughter who enjoyed London for the first time. From the time we checked-in we received great service. The bed is divine and the breakfast amazing, don't miss it. The location is great, just near Oxford and Soho, and there is an underground station nearby so that you get all that you need at your fingertips.",5,2021,09,27
115,Gorgeous hotel with excellent service!,We can’t compliment the staff enough for their attentiveness. The hotel was gorgeous too and really well placed location wise for us. Pros - really clean room with comfy bed and good bathroom. The staff were great too. Cons - could’ve done with a car valet service and the food and drink was overly fussy and a bit pretentious for us. Room was also a bit small but that’s a London thing rather than specifically this hotel. ,4,2021,09,26
115,Will be returning soon !!,Came to visit family and they took me to their local and I found an Amazing pub love the garden and decor was blown away by the  great food had the skewers which were very tasty and the friendly staff made it a great place to be thanks for a wonderful evening. ,5,2021,09,25
115,A Birthday Celebration,I celebrated my birthday here during an overnighter - first time away in 2 years! It did not disappoint. Everything from the check in experience to the room and delicious meal at the Dalloway Terrace in the evening followed by cocktails in the Coral Room! The staff were exemplary and I cannot thank them enough for a memorable stay. I will be back! Highly recommend.,5,2021,09,25
115,Wonderful staff,"Bianca Dias and the whole Ops team looked after us all so well for our business event. We did not need to worry about anything as they were so polite, helpful, proactive and efficient. Would definitely recommend.",5,2021,09,24
115,Wow - what a place xx,Such a memorable place to stay. From the staff to the locat - it made our weekend from start to finish. We can’t wait to return. The staff were so friendly and nothing was too much. The room spacious and luxurious. ,5,2021,09,22
115,Home away from home,"We had a magnificent 7 day stay at the Bloomsbury - really funky and fab interior design. Home away from home. Not unlike its sister hotel - the Westbury in Dublin - so it did not disappoint. The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly but a big SHOUT OUT especially to Estelita, Maria & Nico in the Breakfast room who greeted everyone with a big smile each day. Magdalena ( chamber service) was also very efficient and polite. We look forward to a return soon again!",5,2021,09,21
115,TOP OF THE LINE SERVICES,"My wife and I decided to spend the last days of August at The Bloomsbury Hotel to somehow escape from the hustles and bustles of work life.  We're surprised to know that the hotel is actually in close proximity to all the main spots in the City like the infamous Chinatown which is actually just few mins walk. All sorts of shops, restaurants, theaters, buses and tubes are just within reach too.

Looking inside the building itself, Bloomsbury boasts a very elegant, refined and plush amenities. Their Dalloway Terrace and The Coral Room are very bold, vibrant and stylish. They also serve an array of mouthwatering breakfast menus - the continental generously serve on a weekend. The rooms are all good-sized, beautifully cleaned and comfortable to stay in! 

As wonderful as the place are their staffs, from the concierge to the receptionists (If I remember their names right, Margarita and Sebastian are just so warm and accomodating), to the housekeeping who are always ready to help and check us if we needed something, and the best of all - the kitchen crew! Special shout out to Estelita, Florin, Mary and Jair, who were always ready to greet us with their smiling faces every morning and offer us their top of the line services! We were spoiled 😂

With all these, we're still wondering why The Bloomsbury Hotel is not yet in the 5-star ranks as they have obviously exceeded way beyond our expectations for a 4-star hotel!

We'll definitely be back for more ❤️
",5,2021,09,19
115,Fabulous location and wonderful staff,"This hotel is centrally located in downtown London and an easy walk to most places.  The Dalloway Terrace, Coral Room and Breakfast each morning are fantastic and beautifully decorated.  But what stands above all else is the friendly and professional staff.  The Bellman, the front desk, the concierge and the Breakfast crew were all wonderful.  They went out of their way to make us feel welcome and to ensure we enjoyed our stay.  We would highly recommend the Bloomsbury when visiting London!",5,2021,09,13
115,Private Dinner at Dalloway Terrace Restaurant,"We booked the Coral Garden at Dalloway Terrace Restaurant for a private Dinner. The Restaurant is located at the Bloomsbury Hotel and the evening was just perfect!
Bianca from the Events Team did a great job in organizing everything down to the last dot, and Nicu and Florin did an amazing job during the evening in keeping everyone's drinks filled and providing just fantastic service. THANK YOU to the Team at the Bloomsbury for hosting such a spectacular evening, we can't wait to be back!

115,Just superb.,"Really excellent hotel. Pretty much everything was perfect. Fantastic, spacious rooms, with superb fittings and great toiletries. The staff were hugely helpful, cheerful and generous with their time. Food was great. Highly recommended. We will be back!",5,2021,09,11
115,Comfortable stay,"Convenient location, very comfortable beds and pillows, attentive and friendly staff.  Rooms were cool and very quiet despite central location  and breakfast was delicious Will definitely be staying again! ",5,2021,09,11
115,A most memorable visit,"Had the most memorable visit to this outstanding property in the centre of the capital.  The rooms are of a very high standard with amazing beds.  The staff are just the best you can meet. Their appearance, friendship and attention to detail are there for all to see.  The following people deserve a very special mention. The breakfast staff lead by Marie, along with Florin, Estelita, Alex and Victor.   In the Coral Bar the energy provided by the staff was like watching a musical. I include Kenny, Shaquiri, Alexandra and Valentina.  The Reception Team were so friendly on our arrival and departure.  A big big thanks to the Hotel Manager John Kelly for arranging our visit.  All those mentioned are wonderful ambassadors for the company.  Will be back for sure.",5,2021,09,10
115,It hardly gets better!,"From the moment one enters this hotel to the day of departure, the staff is consistently welcoming, supportive, and ever-aware of you as their guest.  In particular, Maria, Estelita, and Victor in the breakfast room.  I have never been served better in any of the hundreds of hotels and restaurants I've frequented around the globe.  Sebastian and Ivan at reception never miss a beat, are extremely professional, and always have answers to the myriad inquiries one might pose.  The room I stayed in was perfectly appointed, always remade as if the first day by the capable and careful housekeeping staff, and served as a welcome respite at the end of each work day.  The location of the Bloomsbury Hotel allows ease of movement all in a context of safety.  I can't say enough positive things about this place!",5,2021,09,10
115,Bloomsbury London,"Beautifully decorated hotel, rooms were lovely, relaxed atmosphere with pleasant helpful staff. The bar area contained some beautiful art work. The lounge was welcoming, the ambience in the hotel was calm and I will definitely return for another visit and use the collection of hotels when visiting other cities. ",5,2021,09,10
115,Fantastic stay,"We had an excellent few days in this lovely hotel. The staff were friendly and professional, the communal rooms were beautiful and the bedroom was immaculately clean and very comfortable. We went on their summer deal of 3 nights for the price of 2, including breakfast, which made it good value for such a hotel in the centre of London. 
Couldn’t fault it.",5,2021,09,09
115,2 day stay in central London,"Excellent hotel, very good value for money, great food. The hotel was perfectly positioned for all the London sights and central for London theatres. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and made our stay a memorable occasion ",5,2021,09,09
115,Fantastic hotel,"The Bloomsbury is a beautifully decorated hotel in the centre of London with extensive amenities such as the Coral Bar for drinks, outdoor terrace for dining, a gym and a gorgeous reception waiting room. The staff were so friendly and accommodating. Would love to come back! ",5,2021,09,08
115,best breakfast ever,"I usually regard expensive central London hotels as over-priced and poor value. it is often difficult to understand where the money goes. At this hotel, you can see that lots of money has gone on beautiful decor, but, fortunately, they seem also to value their staff and the customer experience that they provide. While all staff were friendly and helpful, the service from Victor, Mary and Maria-Florit at breakfast was exceptional. The breakfast menu was fantastic, and combined with outstanding service, it added up to the best hotel breakfast we have ever experienced.",5,2021,09,06
115,Class of London,"Quirky, clean, ambient Hotel. Lovely warm atmosphere. Bit of a buzz (but not a party hotel)  Absolute class. You are made to feel special. Great spots for Instagram photos. The Coral room is our favourite bar in London. 10 mins from covent garden aswell. good location.",5,2021,09,06
115,Birthday weekend for my partner,"We arrived at the hotel and were immediately greeted by friendly and welcoming staff at the door of the hotel and then another staff member checked us in. Extremely professional and friendly and when asked what our plans were I explained it was my partners birthday. The gentlemen congratulated him and said he would like to upgrade our room and also give us a drink each of our choice at the bar! We did not expect that at all but was so lovely and as I had already booked the coral room at the hotel for later that evening it was great. In fact really great that after our evening out in London we came back again. Great atmosphere and service and the cocktails are amazing. 

After checking in we went to our room and immediately feeling relaxed and a lovely sized clean room. A big comfy bed which we both slept great in. A lovely room and good measurements in place due to Covid such as sealing the access/key card to open for each new guest. 

When checking out after a lovely one night stay another gentlemen helped us with this and also very friendly. Also as we were able to leave our bags with concierge when we came to collect them later that day the same gentlemen advised us about possible train/tube issues and also searched the lines for us. 

My partner and I really are very impressed and really enjoyed our stay. I personally felt safe with the measurements in place and the whole service from start to end was perfect. This made his birthday so I would definitely recommend this hotel and would love to come back.

Thank you! ",5,2021,09,05
115,"Very well run ,friendly hotel, great location.","Really enjoyed our stay at this excellent hotel. 
All staff so good, particular mention to the breakfast team of Maria, ,Victor and Estelita, really professional and friendly.
Excellent location and very good value for money.
Lovely decor, brand new stylish bar, 
Highly recommended!,",5,2021,09,04
115,Great Hotel Option,"Excellent experience.  The hotel is in a perfect location.  Many pubs, shops and restaurants within walking distance.   The guest service staff is very welcoming and helpful.  The rooms are very clean and vary is size.  

If you heading to London this is a great hotel option.",5,2021,09,02
115,Adnan,Excellent hotel . Great location and very clean. Staff are extremely helpful. I loved the restaurants staff and how they greeted all the guests by their surnames Also the gate man is extremely helpful if you need directions. ,5,2021,09,01
115,Just stunning…,"First visit to London since lockdowns and what a find, The Bloomsbury is an amazing hotel for its decor and design - the reason I chose it for our anniversary celebration - but it’s the hotel staff that made this special for us. Nothing was too much trouble and we were thoroughly spoiled during our visit. Our classic room overlooked rooftops and was light and airy. Dalloway terrace restaurant each evening offered fabulous food in a beautiful setting, cosy too with rugs as the night chilled. Coral Lounge was glorious and we tried the cocktails from the cute menu book. The sitting room was a delight to end each evening in and read up about the hotel’s fascinating history. Cannot wait to come back.",5,2021,08,31
115,Thoroughly recommend,"Beautiful hotel, spotlessly clean rooms and very friendly staff, we’ve stayed here before and it was lovely to go back after 18 months or so and enjoy it all over again. Special mention to Maria, Florin and the team at breakfast who are just delightful.",5,2021,08,31
115,Just perfect!,"This hotel is perfect from start to finish. We were greeted by the lovely doorman and then Roxanne on reception who could not have been more welcoming  and even sent a box of macaroons to our room for our anniversary. I requested Oat milk in the room for my tea and it arrived super quick- nothing is too much trouble. We stayed in a deluxe room which was very spacious and loved having the separate bath and walk in shower. Our friend were having afternoon tea at the Dalloway Terrace the next day and we went to surprise them and say hello, the lovely Magdelena even managed to move us all to a bigger table even though we had not booked so we all enjoyed an impromptu lunch. We have stayed in many London hotels and this one is definitely up there with the best- the atmosphere and general vibe around the hotel is what is unique and we will definitely be back- thank you for a lovely stay!",5,2021,08,30
115,A different stay to previous experiences.. :(,"We booked The Bloomsbury as we have stayed there many time in the past but I doubt we would stay there again!

It was our 15th Wedding Anniversary and probably like most people the first time we have managed to get away since the whole Covid thing began, so a highly anticipated and we left disappointed.

It used to be a pretty neat hotel, in a great location for “theatreland” but it seems to have become more about being a bar and restaurant with some rooms upstairs.. the old lobby has now become the The Coral Room so you arrive at the hotel at the side and are invited to drag your bags up the steps and through the outside dining area were   everyone sat at their tables can critique your bag carrying form, once in the new lobby which is tiny compared to its previous location we checked in and got told we had been assigned the best room in our room rate bracket (so the room we paid for) to celebrate our 15th.. 

I am actually already bored of writing about what used to be our favourite place to stay in London… so I’ll just stop as we fed back to the management our thoughts on our stay. 

Thankfully outside the bar with rooms above all is well, the show was excellent, after the first nights attempt at dinner service in hotels bar come restaurant ate elsewhere and enjoyed our time out of the hotel.",3,2021,08,28
115,Superb Service all round,"We booked two rooms for one night to catch up with family. One classic and one deluxe, both very good. From the moment we arrived we had  a strong feeling of staff very happy and really wanting to make your stay exceptional.  We got an early check-in, and a great lunch at the Coral Bar which we also went into later  for a nightcap. It has an amazing vibe. The breakfast was really good. We managed a farewell drink on the Dalloway Terrace which was very busy but they found a table for us.  Hotel is well situated for Soho and Covent Garden,  The service at reception, the bar, at breakfast all amazing. We will return when next in London,",5,2021,08,27
115,A wonderful return to this lovely hotel,"I have stayed at this hotel several times but was worried about returning after the pandemic. I wasn't sure if it would be the same.  I need not have worried. From my arrival to my departure everything was excellent. As I got to my room I was followed by a young man bearing a lovely fruit bowl. He said welcome to The Bloomsbury and placed it my room and left. Wonderful start. The following day was my birthday and I had booked The Dalloway for lunch. On arrival I was greeted warmly and escorted to my table. The food was excellent, the service was very attentive and beyond reproach. All the staff made me feel very special, especially when they brought out dessert on a plate with happy birthday artfully written on the plate. The Coral Room is the only bar open at the moment and is not to my taste but service was very good.
Breakfast is always excellent here and the staff are always happy and willing to help.  Special thanks to Estelita, Maria and Mary for the way they looked after me throughout my stay.
I would also like to thank Sebastian for organising everything for my stay",5,2021,08,27
115,Brilliant hotel-will be back,"Just what the doctor ordered. Excellent staff,lovely atmosphere.Did not want to leave !
Loved the decor, but loved the staff even more. Nothing was too much trouble-even remembered I was going to the theatre and asked me if I had enjoyed it. That’s good hospitality.",5,2021,08,27
115,A-M-A-Z-I-N-G !!!,"Staff were amazing, in particular Estelita-Maria and Mary Hussein who served us breakfast. The team on reception were very helpful and welcoming too ! We loved staying at the Bloomsbury in London and will definitely be back as soon as possible",5,2021,08,26
115,Amazing Hotel,"If you're visiting the West end, London,  this is the perfect hotel; stunningly pretty,  spotless,  staff helpful and friendly.  Breakfast of champions,  really set us up for a day of shopping. Can't wait to return.",5,2021,08,26
115,Beautiful hotel with excellent staff. ,"Stunning hotel in a great, central location. Easy access to all the central tourist locations, short walk to both Tottenham Court Rd and Holborn tube stations. 

Cocktails and food are excellent quality and well portioned; Both the Dolloway Terrace and The Coral Room are equally beautiful and make a trip a real experience.

By far the hotel's finest asset is its wonderful team who were all welcoming, friendly and helpful;  A special mention to Alexandra in F&B who was incredibly welcoming and made our trip more memorable. ",5,2021,08,26
115,Gorgeous hotel,"The scene was set by a friendly, welcoming doorman. Reception then greeted us warmly too, checked us in swiftly, even allowing access to our room mid morning as it was available. The bedroom although not huge, was beautifully laid out and smartly decorated. Huge, comfy bed. Bathroom a bit small and the lighting could be better for applying make up, but a minor point as everything else during our stay was fab. A hospitality tray offered all the teas and coffees required along with bickys, replenished daily. Water available too. There is also a well stocked pay mini bar. Our room was on 6th floor at the rear of the hotel, so beautifully quiet. The residents lounge is tastefully decorated with a glowing fire. We didn't use the bar or terrace restaurant but they looked great. As it was my husbands birthday he was wished happy birthday on arrival and also given some tasty boxed macarons, which was very sweet. We were also given complimentary packs of hand gel and wipes - a nice touch. The hotel is situated near Oxford Street, so great for shopping. There are also some eateries and bars within immediate walking distance. We would most certainly stay here again. All in all a great experience, especially for a special occasion. ",5,2021,08,26
115,Fantastic stay in London,"Wow, have had a fantastic stay at the Bloomsbury which is in a great location. We were able to walk everywhere in London and come back to the fabulous Bloomsbury at the end of the day. As our trip was to celebrate a 50s birthday the we were treated to a lovely sweet gift as we arrived. We booked an early dinner as going to the theatre later and it was lovely. We were surprised again by a special dessert for my friends 50s birthday. We then enjoyed free cocktails at the coral room which is a great place to have drinks. I think it could be my new place for drinks even when not staying at The Bloomsbury. But the best part of the stay is the staff who are so welcoming, attentive and friendly. They made us feel right at home on the middle of the bustling Capital.",5,2021,08,25
115,Fabulous,"A fabulous hotel with fabulous staff.
The staff were so friendly and helpful, they made you feel that your stay was really important to them.  Breakfast was a lovely experience, with Estelita, Horin, Mary and Maria all doing an amazing job. The Coral Bar staff and Dalloway Terrace staff were equally wonderful, serving delicious food and delightful cocktails.
We loved our elegant bedroom and the bed was the most comfortable we had ever experienced in a hotel. We will be back!!",5,2021,08,24
115,Fantastic stay,"We recently stayed at The Bloomsbury Hotel for my wife's 60th Birthday. We booked 3 rooms and the hotel could not have been more helpful with all our special requests, cot in one room, flowers in another etc. The friendly helpful staff combined with this luxurious, well appointed hotel in the heart of London ensured my wife's birthday was a roaring success. We have stayed at The Bloomsbury before and will definitely be staying again, cannot recommend this hotel high enough. ",5,2021,08,24
115,Super 8 Night Stay,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel for 8 nights. In that time we got to know the hotel team very well. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel at home. It was clear everyone worked very well together and enjoyed their work. A special mention to Estralita and her team Victor, Miguel, Hussein at breakfast. Also Ivan at reception was always very helpful. The service and food were consistently excellent. This is an excellent Hotel in an ideal location for London City.",5,2021,08,23
115,Had a very nice time,"Myself and a friend was visiting London for a few days and we decided to stay at this hotel. The reception staff really made us feel welcomed and also gave us some recommendations of the attractions we could go and see. 
During the mornings, we would go and have breakfast and I have to say the breakfast staff was good, especially  Estelita who was really welcoming, friendly and always available. Looking forward to going back.",4,2021,08,21
115,Excellent stay at the Bloomsbury,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury for my Partners Birthday what a wonderful hotel located in a great area close to Oxford Street, Covent Garden and Theatreland.

115,Birthday stay with family,Great hotel. Great staff. Great location. Great beds + bedding. Every request was no trouble. Good room rates (for London) inc b/fast. Hope those rates stay! Small but very functional bathroom - just the normal for West End. Held our luggage whilst we went out after check-out. Booked taxi for our return journey to train station. Big shout out to the reception staff who gave us complimentary cocktail vouchers for The Coral Bar - to celebrate our birthday stay. We will 100% be going back. We took the Brunch at the Dalloway Terrace which was also great.  ,5,2021,08,17

Such a beautiful room and incredibly quiet for London. Both had a great night sleep and the location is great for walking to where we want to go. Ate both nights in the Coral room - lovely food ( menu very limited for my hubby who doesn't eat shell fish or cheese ). Will be back. ",5,2021,08,15
115,PERFECTION,"Weve had 3 nights of perfection staying at The Bloomsbury,. Upgraded to a luxury suite by the wonderful French receptionist, amazing cocktails served by the friendly guys in The Coral Room with their smoke bubble gun, and superb breakfast served by Victor snd Estelita every morning - really good batista americano coffee, crispy bacon and great service.
",5,2021,08,15
115,Excellent stay in London,We stayed at the Bloomsbury for 3 nights and had a wonderful time. The room was immaculately presented and all the staff were polite and helpful. The Coral Room for a brief stop at cocktail hour or for a nightcap is a must and breakfast hosted by Estelita and Victor was lovely. A thoroughly enjoyable break!,5,2021,08,15
115,Great Night In London,"Celebrating with friends for their birthday we stayed at the Bloomsbury, starting with Cocktails in the Coral Room.

Decorated, we had breakfast In the morning and the staff were once again very attentive in particular Estelita, victor and Florin, would definitely recommend this place if your staying in London as it’s also very well located",5,2021,08,14
115,Classy!,"We decided to decamp from where we live in South East London to Central London for a couple of nights and availed ourselves of the hospitality of The Bloomsbury and its consistently outstanding staff.

The hotel is in a prime location and you can strike out for Soho, Fitzrovia and even Clerkenwell and The City.

There are grander, more chi chi and more well-appointed hotels but if there are hotels that match The Bloomsbury’s consistency and class, then you must go. But if you don’t know of any, don’t look any further than The Bloomsbury. 

Special mention goes to the bartenders at The Coral room. The Coral Room doesn’t have the glamour of The Connaught, Scarfe’s ate The Rosewood or Duke’s but the room is nice enough and the counter, where you can have the more or less undivided attention of highly competent, professional and discreet staff is worth an hour or do of anyone’s time.",5,2021,08,13
115,A lovely hotel in a fantastic location,"A warm & friendly welcome and made to feel special.  A lovely small boutique hotel located within 5 minute walk to Covent Garden, Oxford Street, tube station.  Delicious breakfast.  Beautiful terrace for drinks & lunch/dinner.  2nd time to visit this hotel & would def stay again.",4,2021,08,12
115,Boutique Feel with Personal Service,"Great location, easy walking distance to Soho, Theatreland as well as less busy Bloomsbury. Outstanding personal service with engaging staff throughout. Wonderful buffet and a la Carte breakfast with hot options including full English. Very comfortable bed. Small bathroom (often case with central London hotels). Coral Room bar well worth a cocktail!",5,2021,08,11
115,"Hotel is accessible to tube lines and fantastic staff - Estelita, Victor and Florin.","We stayed as a family for 2 nights.
The excellent experience starts from check-in, the receptionist were so polite and helpful.

The room was clean and comfortable and very quiet considering it's on the centre of the city.

Let me say my utmost gratitude and thanks to the ever so helpful staff in the breakfast hall - Estelita, Victor and Florin. Their service and customer service is second to none. Their food is superb.

Our afternoon tea experience as well is splendid. We booked it for our son's birthday and when the staff heard about our son's big day, they have complimented us with birthday treats.

All in all the experience was more than excellent. Will definitely be going back again.",5,2021,08,11
115,FAB Breakfast!,"Wow! Wonderful breakfast at The Bloomsbury. Fresh fruit salad followed by superb Full English. Wonderful sausages and tomatoes bursting with flavour.

115,Beautiful hotel with excellent service,"Myself and my husband had a great stay recently at the Bloomsbury. It’s such a beautiful hotel with superb service. 

Our room was lovely with a really comfortable bed and large bathroom. Service from the reception team and concierge; especially Brian, Ivan and Sebastian was excellent. Brian even walked us to our bus stop and waited with us when we were leaving, what an absolute gent. 

The Dalloway Terrace and coral room were very impressive. Giorgi provided great service on the patio and Stefan at the bar made us some delicious cocktails.

Breakfast was great too and again the staff were so friendly and helpful, in particular Estillita and Andrei. 

We can’t wait for our next visit.",5,2021,08,09

115,Wonderful hotel in the heart of Bloomsbury,"We stayed for our wedding anniversary and it couldn't have gone better. The Coral Room bar had a bottle of the sparkling wine we had at our wedding (Nyetimber) and we had champagne in our room when we got back. The bed was so comfortable and the staff here are among the best I've ever met – friendly, attentive and very helpful. ",5,2021,08,04
115,Fantastic place to stay,"What a great find! We were a small production who needed to base ourselves at the hotel for a day and we were looked after by the great staff members who were very attentive and looked after us beautifully. This hotel is such a gem, in a prime location in London and offers a fantastic cocktail bar and restaurant perfect for brunch perfect for any business or personal retreat within the city.",5,2021,08,03
115,Beyond my expectations Fabulous Hotel,"If you are reading some reviews before you book the Bloomsbury Hotel, then you will be reassured that this is indeed a fantastic hotel.

I booked directly with the hotel there are other sites you can book with but I have always found that if you book direct things are so much simpler also they have various offers that are not available to other sites so check the Bloomsbury website for offers.

We chose the make a night of it offer which is amazing as it offers an early check-in from 10 am and much more importantly a late check out at 14:00 so if you are out late to see a show or partying then this is incredible as most hotels are 11;00 am or midday if you are lucky.

On arrival, a complimentary hand sanitiser was given and with this small gesture informed me that all relevant procedures were in place and reassured me we were in safe hands.  We were escorted to our room which was very large and well-appointed as we were booked in on a Sunday (which is generally quieter) I asked if we could be upgraded and to my surprise and great delight we were offered another room.

After 5 minutes of arriving, I was delighted with my choice of Hotel so straight away I was very happy until we went down to the Coral room where we ordered a cocktail called Garden Party and it was the best cocktail I have ever had served perfectly in a cooper Coupé it was divine, so we had another one! 

The hotel also has an outdoor restaurant which is suitable whatever the weather.
I liked the whole ambience of the hotel as it was very relaxed and a professional friendly atmosphere which was a constant throughout our stay even when the restaurant was busy so it will pay to book this in advance when you book your room.

The food and service are excellent no more needed than that.

The breakfast was perfect.

So from the moment, we arrived, to the moment we left the Bloomsbury team went out of their way to ensure that we were totally satisfied.

I would like to thank Roxane for ensuring our brief stay was exceptional 

George and Hovo in the Dalloway terrace for fantastic service.

There are of course other staff who were equally effortlessly professional whilst still remaining friendly that ensured our stay was perfect.

This will be my first choice of hotel for my next stay in London

Once you factor in the early arrival and late checkout and amazing breakfast included and £75 to spend on food or drinks then it represents very good value

There is an NCP car park 7 minutes walk away which is reasonable, book in advance online and you just drive in and drive out it's very secure and you walk right past the British Museum on the way.

I liked the way the entrance to the hotel is tucked away it feels more exclusive.

So if you are whisking your partner off for a romantic weekend or a family you will be happy with your choice.",5,2021,08,03
115,The best hotel EVER!,"I've lost count of the amount of times I've visited this wonderful hotel & I've never been disappointed! Excellent service with the most delightful staff. George on The Dalloway terrace is an absolute delight. Rooms are spotless & the hotel is in the perfect position. I've recommended to many, many people who have all enjoyed as much as I have.",5,2021,08,03
115,weekend break,"Loved staying at this hotel, the staff were so friendly and the service was amazing, nothing seemed too much trouble. The hotel itself was spotless and we loved the decor. would not hesitate to recommend a stay here.",5,2021,08,02
115,The Bloomsbury gets so many things right,"From its location in the heart of London, to its frankly stunning public spaces, to its helpful, welcoming staff, there is so much to love about this hotel. We truly enjoyed our one-night stay for a theatre visit in the West End, which was a short walk away from the hotel.

Our only disappointments were 1) the fact that the hotel’s art deco aesthetic really wasn’t reflected in the pefectly nice but rather bland Classic and Deluxe rooms our family stayed in. I’ll be honest: after walking past the lovely terrace restaurant and through the stunning public rooms, I felt let down when I saw our room. 2) The Coral Room, which seemed a bit like a victim of its own success when we visited. We’d booked a table for a pre-theatre light meal, but maybe we would have been better off just having a drink there. To start, we were seated at a ‘high’ table, which frankly makes eating less congenial. I’d have asked to be moved to one of the lower seating areas, but the bar was pretty much full when we got there. Also, I’m not sure I understand why we were given a book with the bar’s specialty cocktails, but when we asked for the food menu we were told to scan a code. Don’t get me wrong: it’s a gorgeous bar and the bartending staff were very entertaining, but I feel it’s in danger of becoming more of a photo op than a relaxed drinking and dining establishment.

Those two points aside, we loved our stay here. Maybe next time we’ll plump for one of the art deco inspired suites, and eat in the Dalloway Terrace.",4,2021,08,02
115,Faultless!,"Just returned home from a four night stay at this fabulous hotel. From arrival to departure the experience was exceptional. We've been fortunate to travel extensively, and although The Bloomsbury is listed as a four star hotel, the facilities, attention to detail and customer care would unequivocally rate as five stars in my book. 
I could mention a number of staff members by name who helped make our stay so pleasurable but truth be told, all the staff were fantastic, from reception and bar staff to our housekeeper. Probably the most comfortable bed we've slept in too!
Thanks to all concerned. You are a credit to yourselves and to the hotel. We'll be back!!",5,2021,07,31
115,A lovely 1 night getaway,"What a lovely hotel in a great location. We stayed in a classic queen bed room, the decor was stunning, especially the bathroom and the rooms were a perfect size for 1 night stay. The room had everything you could ask for. Staff were friendly and the breakfast was really nice. I especially liked how it wasn’t just a buffet breakfast (apart from the cold stuff) and you ordered what you wanted from a menu. 

Would definitely recommend this hotel and we will definitely be staying here again when we come back to London.",4,2021,07,31
115,Beautiful hotel fantastic restaurant.,"Amazing few days in London. First time stay at The Bloomsbury and I can't recommend it enough.  All the staff were lovely, the room was fantastic.
We had two meals on the Dalloway Terrace which were superb, the staff were very attentive. 
Breakfast was also amazing and the staff again were fantastic, thank you to Estelita and Victor for making our start to the day so good and looking after out 11 year old son.
Would definitely stay here again as it was so central to getting around.",5,2021,07,30

Organised by Bianca Dias and served on the day by her colleague Florin, it was a seamless experience in a private Coral Garden space. The whole process from booking, to arriving, to enjoying and leaving was easy, seamless, professionally handled and excellent. Couldn't rate it more highly!",5,2021,07,28
115,Wedding Lunch,"The Bloomsbury gave us a lovely wedding lunch in the private Coral Garden space. It was a very warm day but the space was covered and provided some shade, though there could've been more - there was a lot of sun on the backs of guests on one side of the table. The food was lovely and we were able to choose from a great menu for starters, mains, and desserts. They also provided a wedding cake for us, a beautiful Victoria sponge. My husband isn't a dessert person and he loved it. For the planning we worked with Bianca Dias who was helpful and communicative the whole way through. Planning a wedding during COVID and closures in London wasn't easy but she made it as simple as possible. I cannot recommend this venue enough.",4,2021,07,28
115,Nights on Us,"The check in and check out went very smoothly. On weekdays, they only do ala carte for breakfast and not a buffet, but everything was great. Good-sized portions and not bland.

I would highly recommend for business or pleasure.",5,2021,07,27

Bed supremely comfortable and food of highest quality. Cocktail bar luxurious with great atmosphere.

Loved the hotel as it seems to have its own individuality and did not seem too corporate. ",5,2021,07,23

115,Great stay in a lovely hotel,"Excellent stay from start to finish, We visited London for the first time in a while for our wedding anniversary and I booked a weekend deal at the Bloomsbury. 
A couple of days before our stay I received a phone call asking if there was anything they could arrange for our stay. I asked for a bunch of flowers for my wife which I’m pleased to say were lovely and well worth the money. 
The staff were friendly and attentive with Ivan and Brian being the stand out stars of our stay. Nothing was too much trouble for them and they made our whole stay effortless. 
The room was large and well appointed, our lunch in the Coral Room and our Breakfast were both excellent. 
It really was a pleasure to stay in the hotel and we will definitely visit again.",5,2021,07,18

The Dalloway Terrace is a beautiful restaurant which we thoroughly enjoyed eating in, and the Coral Room is an eclectic bar with a really nice vibe.

Breakfasts very good, with friendly staff who cannot do enough to help.  Shout out to Maria and colleagues!

Rooms comfortable and beds very nice to sleep in.  We will definitely be back.",5,2021,07,10

Cristina was incredibly helpful and clear with her communication, and helped to ensure everything was in place for the day. Florin looked after us at the venue, and helped us with anything we needed. The library and chapel are gorgeous, and we will definitely be using this venue for our annual away days! Cannot recommend enough.",5,2021,07,07
115,weekend with family,"lovely hotel, well appointed, great team of people looking after us and good food.
Sitting in the terrace for dinner was a joy.
Coral Room was exciting and fun.
Everyone was happy to help, support and I don't think we heard the NO during our stay. They went to great lengths to make us happy and comfortable. A most welcome difference from other hotels we have stayed in recently.",5,2021,07,06
115,Great hotel ,"I was supposed to be staying at The Marylebone Hotel, however due to a maintenance issue we were booked in here instead.  I was pleasantly impressed with the hotel & room. We stayed in a king suite, which was lovely. The hotel was decorated to a high standard. Great location for a shopping break. Breakfast was good, comfy bed, enjoyed my stay and would return. Friendly staff. ",4,2021,07,05
115,Family Celebration,"The Bloomsbury is a luxurious hotel hidden away in Fitzrovia.  The staff are extremely friendly and efficient.  We had drinks on the Dalloway Terrace and also in the Coral Bar great atmosphere.   Lovely room and very comfortable bed with luxurious bed linen.  Despite covid we didnt feel that the ambiance in the hotel was compromised, would definitely return for another visit.",5,2021,07,05
115,Excellent,"A beautiful hotel hidden away from the hussle & bustle but a stones throw from Oxford Road. The terrace for brunch is wonderful, very attentive staff and a good menu. Cocktails in the Coral bar are a must… !! We had a twin room which was ample, good amenities in the room. So good to see the hotel open and welcoming again. Definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2021,07,04
115,Underwhelming and cost cuts are obvious!,"Stayed for my fiancé’s birthday which was mentioned upon booking on both booking.com as well as stating direct. The staff on check in did not wish my fiancé a happy birthday which I would expect to happen. Anyway, upon checking in our room wasn’t ready at 2pm - surprising when we had made them aware we would be early from the outset, as well as low capacity stay. Anyway, not a huge issue as when we did check in we wrrr upgraded. Now the upgrade was underwhelming. It was as if they said we were upgraded but weren’t really. The room was no larger than expected, we had an internal courtyard view (just staring at a wall opposite) and was just fine.
A couple things I must mention:

1. Toilet roll is 1-ply and is appalling quality. For a 4 star establishment I expect more. This is clearly an area they are trying to save money and it is noticeable.

2. Upon check in I noticed a lot of information was lacking I.e breakfast information (location, times served etc). Also no mention of where the gym facilities are etc. A simple, brief overview would’ve been appreciated.

3. Housekeeping knocked to clean our room at 9am - extremely early and when there is a do not disturb sign on our door, I expect exactly that - to not be disturbed!!

4. Upon check out we gave our room card to reception who said “I’ll deal with it” and then went back to his personal conversation with his colleague on the front desk. I expect at least a “did you have a nice stay?” “Have a good day” “safe onward travels” etc. Nothing! Again, super underwhelming 

5. A small slither of cake was left in our room at 9pm which was very sweet although it was addressed to me and not my fiancé (I had provided his details in the preference form sent prior to our arrival as well in the notes explaining his name and his birthday) so this seemed very impersonal and perhaps only given the slice once it went unsold from the restaurant? Would’ve been nicer if it was in our room upon arrival with the correct name on the card!

6. You can hear everything in the rooms! People outside our room at all times, the lift, the housekeeping staff… the lot! Terribly loud and woken at 4am so I suggest bringing earplugs.

Overall, an underwhelming yet fine stay. Hotel is clean, excellent location, yet I think they are trying to make cost cuts post lockdown and it is noticeable. I also think it doesn’t cost to wish someone a happy birthday so that would’ve been appreciated! It’s the little things after all.",3,2021,07,02
115,Excellent!,"We recently stayed at this wonderful hotel for a weekend stay. The staff were very friendly and efficient. The room was lovely. We had a king size room. The bed was comfortable, a good sized room, lovely decor and bathroom. Very clean. We only ate in the breakfast room but food was very good. The Coral Bar was lovely. Fab location! Would definitely stay here again.",5,2021,06,30
115,A fantastic stay and a truly stunning hotel,"A wonderful experience, from the welcome greeting through to departure, nothing could be faulted. The rooms are generous in size, the facilities are first class and the Coral room cocktails are a must. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay somewhere centrally located in London.",5,2021,06,28
115,Definitely 5* Service!,"From the moment we arrived we were welcomed and received fantastic service. The staff could not have been more helpful and the facilities were amazing.

115,Stylish hotel with first class customer care,Our first trip away since February 2020 and the Bloomsbury hotel didn’t disappoint! All the staff were friendly and welcoming and our room was delightful. The Coral room was impressive and perfect for our lunch and late evening drinks. Super clean throughout,5,2021,06,24
115,Team work event was exceptional at The Bloomsbury,"I worked with Cristina to plan a drinks reception and dinner at the Coral Garden for my team. It went wonderfully and we were looked after by her and Florin so well on the night. The food was great, the venue was stunning and the event went very smoothly and was a huge success.  We would definitely book again.",5,2021,06,23
115,Birthday weekend,"A very late review, but still a very fond memory!
A lovely weekend stay for my birthday and we loved every part of it!
From the Dalloway terrace and coral room. To the giant beds and lovely helpful staff!
It was placed right in the middle of london and we went for evening strolls in oxford street. Shopping in the day time, and fine dining in the evening. 
I want to come back here for a longer stay and enjoy the spa services!",5,2021,06,20
115,A n oasis in central London.,"There are not enough superlatives to describe this hotel & its staff. It really is our home from home. From the minute you arrive you truly feel very special & well cared for. The hotel is of course beautiful. The decor throughout is excellent. Rooms immaculate, very comfortable & super quiet. The breakfast is always perfect. The Dalloway Terrace & The Coral Room are also without fault. Every hotel needs a Sebastion -Manager & the staff are all of the highest standard- friendly, professional, always happy & cannot do enough for you.

115,A Sanctuary in the Centre of London,"We had a one-night stay and wish we had stayed longer! The interior design is gorgeous, and the hotel smelt lovely. It was also spotlessly clean, so we couldn't fault it! 

On arrival we received complimentary hand sanitiser and wipes, which was a thoughtful touch. We were also able to check in early, which was a real bonus.

Breakfast was amazing — so much lovely choice. The team, Estelita and Victor, were warm, welcoming and attentive. We definitely received five-star treatment! ",5,2021,06,10
115,Top hotel,"As usual the Bloomsbury did not disappoint. Great rooms amazing breakfast and friendly helpful staff, what’s not to like? It always surprises me that this hotel is not more expensive considering its location and luxury feel",5,2021,06,10
115,Lovely mother daughter stay in London,"We used the Bloomsbury as our base- excellent location for setting out walking each day. Fab breakfast each morning and we also sined in the super stylish Dalloway Terrace and drank in the Coral room- hip, lovely food... comfortable bed, perfect base",5,2021,06,02
115,BEST IN ITS CLASS,"Despite the effects of lockdown and the industry-wide issues affecting staffing and service-provision, the Bloomsbury has emerged as strong and as splendid as ever. The Dalloway Terrace continues to provide excellent quality with unbeatable service as does the breakfast team, led by Maria and Estalita.  Despite the continuing restrictions, the hotel management and staff were able to provide excellent room and public area quality and service.",5,2021,06,01
115,"Ivan was the perfect host, had a really enjoyable stay","The hotel is located on a quiet street only minutes away from the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street. The staff are most helpful and professional and made for an unforgettable stay. Our room was clean and comfortable, there’s an outside terrace restaurant which has heaters and a canopy that can be pulled over if there’s rain. There’s a good selection of dishes which are reasonably priced for a hotel. The cocktail bar is very smart and had a great atmosphere in the evening. I’d love to stay here again!",5,2021,05,31
115,Everything was perfect,"Me and my partner checked in for my birthday, and upon checking in, Roxanne told me that the hotel prepared a simple cake for me. I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it was very nice of them. She also went up to the room to personally check that our chromecast was working properly since we had trouble operating it but she instructed us what to do and was very polite. 

Also, Ms. Maria and Ms. Estelita in the breakfast service were exceptional in their service, making sure that me and my partner were happy with our meals and even engaging with a light small talk which made our mornings warm. Overall, it was a wonderful stay in the Bloomsbury.",5,2021,05,30
115,Our first trip to London in over a year,"With three close friends I stayed at the Bloomsbury for just one night. Our first meeting since the latest lockdown. The staff were so friendly and helpful. We had very comfortable rooms. There is a beautiful bar and a cosy lounge. Lunch and breakfast both were good. 
A most enjoyable trip. 
Lesley",5,2021,05,24
115,First 2021 weekend break - lockdown ends!,Great hotel whose attention to detail and our experience meant this felt like a normal weekend away. The room was a great size and bed comfy. The doorman was fabulous in his attention to us and the waiting staff on the Dalloway terrace and in the breakfast room attentive and knew what they had on offer,5,2021,05,24
115,Excellent service and Warm Crew,"We stayed in The Bloomsbury for two days and we were warmly greeted by Michael and Ivan. Ivan was so helpful with our check-in process and was very kind to carry our luggage. He offered as sanitation kits which were useful during the stay observing infection control. The room was clean and overall pleasant. The morning crew for breakfast Maria, Estelita, Victor and Joel were very good and greeted us warmly everytime we enter the lovely breakfast hall in the lower ground floor. The toilets were extra clean and sparkling. They were very considerate and Maria offered us extra food as I was pregnant noting that maybe I have some cravings. They maintained their masks all the time and I know very well that behind the their masks are their lovely smiles that serves us all through out our stay. We will definitely be back and recommend this hotel to friends and colleagues.",5,2021,05,23
115,"Bloomsbury Hotel, London",Our group of friends had a wonderful time at the Bloomsbury Hotel on its first night of opening after lockdown. Everywhere was spotlessly clean and the staff were extremely helpful and polite. We were made to feel like honoured guests.,5,2021,05,23
115,Freedom!,"Booked the Bloomsbury with three girlfriends for birthday celebrations on the first day of opening since lockdown

Lovely historic hotel;  beautiful, comfortable surroundings with friendly and helpful staff

Lunch on the Dalloway Terrace was delightful despite the rain and the Coral Room Bar superb 

The hotel is decorated with paintings of famous poets reflecting its literary connections and the Library is worth a visit

All in all a hugely enjoyable stay",5,2021,05,23
115,"Lovely, convenient, friendly, understated hotel.","Stayed at The Bloomsbury with friends on the first night after lockdown.

Whilst the hotel was quiet the outside eating area, Dalloway Terrace was busy - it having opened a few weeks earlier. We lunched in the Dalloway Terrace, the food and service were of a high order. My Salt baked beets with spring leaves, Brightwell Ash goats cheese, smoked almonds & honey Salad was delicious. My friends had the Ancient grain salad with asparagus, broad beans, courgette, mint & lemon vinaigrette which they also enjoyed. For dessert we shared Skillet Brownie with milk ice cream & toasted hazelnuts and Baked lemon cheesecake with English strawberries.

The hotel staff could not have been more helpful. The public rooms and bedrooms were spotlessly clean and tastefully furnished. The bed was very comfortable and so were the pillows.

Breakfast the following morning was waiter service, we were well looked after and I recommend the light fluffy pancakes with bacon and maple syrup.",5,2021,05,22
115,Exceptional in all respects,"Even in ‘Covid times’ with a skeleton crew this hotel excels.
Our room was immaculate, spacious and spotlessly clean. 
The duty manager, Cyrielle, was charming, professional and super friendly.
We asked for ice on our arrival and despite being in charge of the desk,
 Cyrielle brought it to our 4th floor room,(415) within 5 minutes. Very impressive. 
The Dalaway Terrace and Patio served us great food and a special mention to Gio, the maitre d’ who found us a good spot and looked after us. 
I heartily recommend The Bloomsbury Hotel. For a short or long stay in the capital it cannot be bettered. 
Ask for Sebastiaan, the manager if you have any special requests. He is the best.",5,2021,05,09
115,Bloomsbury Hotel Re-visited,"Wonderfull to return to this understated gem.  Despite the restrictions and the professional nature of our visit, the hotel excelled in terms of service and guest experience.  The Dalloway Terrace has reopened in style, picking up where it left off; excellenet food and wine selection with exemplary table service.  It is so gratifying in these very challenging times to be welcomed as a returning guest and treated as a member of this very engaging hotel community.",5,2021,05,02
115,Excellent hotel in a fantastic location ,"We were lucky enough to visit at the start of December just before the new tier system came into effect.We stayed in a Luxury studio king which was beautiful. Don’t expect a view from your room due to the hotels location however if you want to be close to the action then the Bloomsbury can’t be beaten. It’s a ten minute walk to Oxford street, Covent Garden, China town and the theatres of the West end in fact the Dominion is right around the corner. Breakfast was served on the Dalloway Terrace I believe as part of covid prevention measures. As it was December it was a bit chilly but heaters and blankets were provided and I suppose we could have just had room service.
When normal life eventually resumes and you want to stay in a lovely convenient hotel then we highly recommend the Bloomsbury.",5,2020,12,27
115,Just the best hotel EVER!!!,"I have stayed at this hotel many times & have never been disappointed. Stunning hotel, great staff with amazing service. We had cocktails in The Coral Room & dinner on The Dalloway Terrace. Could not fault anything about the place. Will be back soon!",5,2020,12,17
115,Very nice hotel,"I had fantastic stays.  I have nothing to complain. The room was clean, bathroom was nice, a bed was comfortable, breakfast room services were fantastic and room was very quiet. The staff were courteous and present. ",5,2020,12,14
115,Weekend Break ,"This is a gorgeous hotel to stay at in the heart of London. The interiors have been designed to recall the bygone age of the Bloomsbury set complete with luxury,  coziness and a huge friendly welcome from the staff. The Dalloway Terrace was a fabulous place to enjoy a top class breakfast with the most attentive of staff. In the evening,  the Coral room is a glamorous backdrop to enjoy cocktails and great food once again with terrific staff. 
Nothing was too much trouble and the location just above Covent Garden with all its Christmas glamour and buzz was perfect. The British museum is also just a stone’s throw away. 
Thank you to Ivan? On the desk who was so cheerful and helpful. I can’t wait to return. A huge thank you to all the management and in house team who made us feel so welcome. ",5,2020,12,14
115,Saturday stay,"Anniversary celebration. Travelled up on the day. Stayed in nearby NCP. Very friendly staff. Nice room. Disappointed there was only the terrace space for breakfast. Cold and raining so very uncomfortable, ended up not having breakfast as we were too cold. Understand this was probably due to COVID. However should have been informed and offered room service.",4,2020,12,14
115,Superb as usual.,"This is a ’5 star’ establishment. The rooms are lovely. The staff are efficient and gracious. The situation is perfect for the west end and all it offers.
The cocktails in the famous Coral Room are a knockout and Gio’, the manager, is probably the best host on the London cocktail bar scene without doubt. 
The breakfast is very good and Maria the Maitre d’ always remembers us and is very attentive and professional. Nothing is too much trouble for her or Estelita her co worker. 
The Duty Manager, Sebastian always makes sure that our stay is a joy and a special mention for Ivan, formerly the likeable giant doorman, who is now learning the management business under Sebastian’s guidance. Ivan has an unshakeable positive vibe and makes us feel like ‘special’ guests. 
Once again, a memorable stay at The Bloomsbury. ",5,2020,10,18
115,Back to our 2nd home after a year away ,"Well after a year away from this fantastic boutique hotel which we call our second home so good to be back thanks to Sebastian annandale for welcoming us back with a smile even though under a face mask and the other staff in these crazy  and scary times so good to be here a lot of changes have been done but have been done very well due to covid 19 had a lovely room which has been exceptionally sanitised so very safe and clean also spent time in the coral room for drinks which was nice unfortunately due to restrictions our favourite bar the
 Bloomsbury club bar has closed for now we are keeping our fingers crossed it reopens soon as my wife and I have so many great memories of nights spent in there . The dalloway terrace is brilliant especially with current restrictions lovely food and atmosphere. Most importantly we've been able to come back as we were very worried the hotel was never going to open again .well done to all the staff our stay has been magnificent along with 5 star service back again next year 

",5,2020,10,17
115,The perfect weekend break after a tough few months,The restaurant and bars have been very pleasant for a couple of months but we decided to enjoy the recently re-opened rooms. Just wonderful! The perfect tonic for the times. All a very pleasant experience despite the need to be careful. The staff were perfect as always. A weekend to remember.,5,2020,10,06
115,"The Bloomsbury, London","The staff are truly excellent and cannot do enough to ensure your stay is comfortable. We were greeted on the street by a delightful concierge who showed us through to reception. Despite arriving way too early for our room to be ready we were checked in, luggage secured and told that we would be called as soon as our room became available. I've been promised this 'call' service before from other hotels and it doesn't happen - not the case with The Bloomsbury, a quick coffee and walk up Oxford Street and our call came the the room was ready, excellent service. This was our fourth visit to The Bloomsbury, we will be back.",5,2020,03,20
115,Event at the Library bar,"Excellent setting for a small group.  Terrific friendly service from Veronica who managed the crowd superbly all by herself.  She served with a smile and had all the answers

The hotel itself is gorgeous and chic with a fireplace, lovely warm walls",5,2020,03,16
115,Second stay at The Bloomsbury,The Bloomsbury is centrally located to so many things. Jose who greets you as you arrive is wonderful! I was disappointed that the front desk folks didn't note that it was our second visit (full-week visit in September 2019).  The hotel was not full due to Covid19 and season yet we were not offered an upgrade. Our room was very small. We didn't push it because we were only staying one night.,4,2020,03,15
115,We're becoming regulars. Just a lovely way to enjoy London at its best.,"This hotel remains wonderful. The ethos is very warm and welcoming. You feel it is sincere. And it is a very comfortable establishment as well. If you are looking for a very convenient location to make enjoying London very easy, this has got to be a great choice. This time, we had a very sociable family drink in the Coral Room. Loved it! We'll certainly do that again. Another outstanding experience and good value as well.",5,2020,03,13
115,excellent ,we visited this hotel last summer woh my family. excellent spacious family room. staff was friendly and check in was smooth. the place is around the most happening places in the heart of london. the dalloway terrace is another cozy place on the ground floor where you can spend hours drinking the best coffee.we love this place.,5,2020,03,12
115,"Fantastic hotel, super central and warm service","I chose The Bloomsbury for my birthday staycation and couldn't have picked a better spot. It is a gorgeous hotel, with beautiful colourful design and warm, friendly staff (and amazingly comfortable beds!). It is the type of place you don't even need to leave, thanks to the various restaurants and bars - all of which have their own unique style. However, many of London's cultural attractions, West End theatres and restaurants in Covent Garden, Fitzrovia and Soho are so nearby.",5,2020,03,12
115,Wonderful experience,"We decided to choose The Bloomsbury Hotel to meet with our family and friends and celebrate our special day. We could not made a better choice! The Bloomsbury Hotel and the entire Team was wonderful and we couldn't be more grateful for what we have experienced. Andrei and Kim were absolutely fantastic from the very first second in organising our party. Nicu, Toma and Samir went beyond my dreams to ensure the room looked stunning, the service was fantastic and food absolutely delicious. The service was very profesional and at the same time extremely friendly, nothing was a problem for them and I couldn't be more impressed. Breakfast was very impresive and Maria's and her team's service top quality.  The Bloomsbury Hotel bedrooms are beautiful, spacious and super comfortable. We can't wait for our next visit at The Bloomsbury :)",5,2020,03,12
115,Wonderful Hotel,"Just returned from a 4-night stay at The Bloomsbury, and my husband and I really enjoyed this hotel. The staff is wonderful - everyone at reception was helpful and friendly, and the gentlemen at the door were equally great. Our room was upgraded from a queen bed to a king due to our Orbitz Platinum status, which is always appreciated. While the bed was extremely comfortable, the room was very small (classic king room). The layout of the room and bathroom were also not ideal, but realistically you don’t go to London to spend lots of time in your hotel room. Housekeeping was very good overall, but we ran into a slight hiccup our last evening (already addressed by the hotel’s wonderful manager). My husband and I were celebrating an anniversary, and the hotel welcomed us with a lovely note and chocolate covered strawberries.
What really set The Bloomsbury apart for us was the location. We’ve stayed at a couple of other hotels in London, and the location of The Bloomsbury was far superior. Located about a block off of a main road (Tottenham Court Rd), and two blocks off of Oxford Street, you have access to shops, restaurants, supermarkets, and transportation. Regent Street is also close by, and the British Museum is literally around the corner.
We would absolutely stay at The Bloomsbury again the next time we’re in London.

Oh, and be sure to have a meal at the hotel’s restaurant - Dalloway Terrace. Excellent food, and incredible staff!",4,2020,03,11
115,Fantastic London bolt-hole,"In an excellent location, 3 mins walk from Tottenham Court Road Tube but set back far away from the hustle and bustle, The Bloomsbury is a wonderful secluded bolt-hole in London. Sophisticated but relaxed, with oh so comfy beds and pillows and very friendly staff, this is all you need from a hotel in the city. An ideal location from where to explore but also perfect for a night in watching TV and eating room service. Now we've found this, we will struggle to stay anywhere else in the capital ",5,2020,03,10
115,Great Hotel. Great Service.,"Had a fab night in the Bloomsbury at the weekend. The staff were really friendly and accommodating. I got a complimentary glass of sparkling wine on arrival for my birthday. The rooms are spacious and the decor is lovely. The bar, restaurant and breakfast area are great and had a good vibe to them. It’s in an ideal location near Tottenham Court tube and in walking distance to Oxford Street etc. Will visit again!",5,2020,03,09
115,The Bloomsbury - Seriously Underwhelming,"Stayed here for my wife's birthday. Had mailed and asked for a high floor deluxe room & a classic twin. Were given two very small internal rooms on 3rd floor 1m from the lift doors (301 & 302) - I have seen better at a Premier Inn. Went down to change. Then given slightly better room for us, worse for our sons on the 2nd Floor! (The hotel has 8 floors). Took them - had little choice - at least an outside window (view brick wall).
Asked Roxanne if it was a case of money (I “only"" paid £480 for the rooms for 1 night), but she assured me no, was nothing she could do and this was the best they had. Well to be frank it was poor. Home from home it was not. When we stayed at the Montague it was much better, As was Ampersand and Langham. The Clayton hotel in Chiswick, a bit further out I know but the rooms were seriously better for less than half the price! 
The breakfast - excellent. The staff – polite & tried hard. Appears hotel  being run on a shoestring. Pretending to be 4* top London hotel but in my experience it most certainly not. The rooms let it down. When I asked to get my cases from storage, was told the concierge gone off on a break, back in 30 mins. I queried this and was told everybody needs a break and something to eat! Now whilst this is certainly true - this should not be my problem in such a hotel. Most hotels have at least two if not three people on the concierge desk! We nearly missed our train because the Bloomsbury cannot afford to hire more than one guy.

",3,2020,03,09
115,The Bloomsbury Hotel and Bar,Chose this hotel for a birthday treat as we have spend evenings in the Bloomsbury bar before. Complimentary upgrade (queen to king) on arrival and slice of birthday cake waiting in the room were nice touches. Disappointed not to get a table in The Bloomsbury Bar as there was a party booking and seat in the Coral bar was also not available. That said a great hotel for a special stay in London  ,4,2020,03,09
115,Fab location & super-friendly staff,OK - so the rooms aren’t super cheap but the central location saves on taxis and the service is great. Everyone from reception to concierge to waiters and housekeeping was fabulously friendly and helpful.  Check out The Coral Room for drinks and very sophisticated- (and reasonably priced!!) - bar snacks.  Second stay and will definitely be going back. Well done The Bloomsbury!,5,2020,03,08
115,Corporate Conference,"We hosted a conference for UK attendees, planned from the States and the hotel took great care. Especially on-site by the Banquets team: Florin, Nicu,  Toma, Samir, Veronica  and Husein (please forgive mis-spellings)! They were attentive and proactive with our on-going changes during the meeting sessions.",5,2020,03,05
115,Lovely hotel in a superb location,"A very comfortable hotel with excellent friendly and efficient service at all levels. Great central location for the tube, theatres and Covent Garden.
The room was very well appointed with modern facilities.
Good range of hot and cold breakfast items and the best jam ever served with the scones at afternoon tea.",5,2020,03,04
115,Quality and Service - Second to None,"I booked The Bloomsbury as a treat for my daughter and me, as we were going to the Dominion Theatre for the night and it would save a late long journey home. The room was fabulous, and the bathroom even more so. Underfloor heating in the bathrooms made such a difference! The beds were exceptionally comfortable, the room was quiet, and we had everything we needed to hand. The cocktails in The Coral were well mixed and tasted divine. The hotel staff were exceptionally professional yet friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. Breakfast was freshly cooked to taste, as well as offering continental pastries, cereals, fruits, and more. The hotel is well situated, near to Tottenham Court Road tube station, and a short walk from Oxford Street. Great for the theatre, a day of shopping, or a weekend of relaxation. My new favourite place to stay :)",5,2020,03,03
115,Birthday celebration,"I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel . From the moment we arrived we were made very welcome. The receptionist who greeted us was polite, kind and helpful.
We ere given an amazing room which had plenty of space and a very calming ambience.
The lounge area with its cosy fire is a great place to relax .
The Coral room at night is a lively, fun bar to be in .

The hotel is In a  great location for theatre land , Regent Street , British Museum etc . 

We will return to this hotel in our opinion very good value .",5,2020,03,02
115,Excellent Weekend at The Bloomsbury,"Fabulous weekend trip at the Bloomsbury.  Room amazing, staff accommodating, could not fault a thing!!  Did not know how to sort heating / AC in the room so Maintenance Manager, Ken on hand & helped immediately - great service all round!! Xx ",5,2020,03,01
115,Have a good day Dase <3,"- A nice hotel with a nice stuff, lovely people! 
- The place is a little bit hard to reach, it's in a side street.
- There are some nice guys outside for help (thanks Dase!)
- The room I got was really nice, with nice coffee machine and nice coffee and tea packages.

Post Malone ;)",5,2020,02,29
115,Extremely pleasant stay!,"My visit to see my daughter studying in London for the semester was made that much better by my stay at The Bloomsbury. Every facet of the hotel just could not have been any more pleasing. Staff (Marian, Estelita, Ionut, Victor, Ysabella, to name a few) were very professional and nice. I look forward to another stay there!",5,2020,02,29
115,One of a thousand,"I travel 100 days a year on all continents and meet thousands of people in different situations. Sometimes, rarely, someone stands out with his or her passion and positive energy. Bar tender MARION at the Hotel Bloomsbury belongs to these people, she is one of a thousand! Her passion for perfecting a drink and positive energy that makes people around her simply smile is unique! I’ll come back to this hotel just because of this😊",5,2020,02,28
115,Perfect location for a week in London,"Striking boutique hotel, beautiful decor in public rooms, comfortable bedrooms, elegant marble baths, the wine and food offerings in restaurant and bars were superb, and the hotel staff offered attentive service and were extremely helpful.  ",5,2020,02,27
115,One of the best hotels I’ve stayed in!,"From the moment I stepped into the hotel I was greeted by some lovely staff members who helped with my bags and offered me a fruit juice. My whole stay was amazing. The hotel is so beautiful and the fact you get robes and slippers in your room makes it even better.

I have to say a special thank you to Sebastian on guest relations. I left a curling tong in my room and after checking out and travelling home, I contacted the hotel & Sebastian posted it out to me within an hour of me messaging!",5,2020,02,27
115,Quick trip to London,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury, as we had twice before, as we knew we would be well looked after, the hotel is in a very convenient position to visit central London, and we could make the most of a 3 day stay",5,2020,02,27
115,My wife’s 50th,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel, this being our second visit we were aware of the excellent standards of service but I have say we were blown away by the friendly and helpful staff, from the receptionist to housekeeping all couldn’t do enough. This made our visit which was already special even more memorable.

Thank you 

Richard & Rachel Smithard",5,2020,02,25
115,A real home from home ,From check in to check out we were made to feel so welcome. Our stay included the not to be missed hour long walking tour by the lovely Susie. The Coral bar is such a lovely space & the excellent breakfast served  by Ionut Estelita & Victor is the perfect start to days exploring London - buttermilk chicken in the cocktail bar is perfection- service & atmosphere down here at the end of the day so relaxing- we will revisit the Bloomsbury please God 🙏🏻,5,2020,02,25
115,Another great visit,"Really enjoyed another stay at this place. Location is superb and the hotel itself is great. There's been some changes including the bar where the old lobby used to be. We had some great cocktails late afternoon and at Beth end of the night we also had a great stay in the room. This is an upmarket venue that offers good value for what you get. The staff are great and the thing I really like is that there are simply no issues with the stay,
Also - breakfast is nice - there is a buffet but they also cook to order anything you want from the menu.",5,2020,02,23
115,Weekend in london,"We had a wonderful stay at The Bloomsbury hotel, the staff
 gave us a very warm welcome and couldn’t do enough for us. Hotel was spotless, great location, The Coral Room was great, fabulous selection of cocktails and we genuinely really enjoyed staying here.will definitely come back whether for one night or a few in the future.",5,2020,02,23
115,Week at the Bloomsbury,"Great hotel ,from arriving at reception and meeting really efficient and friendly staff, it set the tone for the week. I was delivering a training course in the hotel and can only say it was a great experience . Friendly staff throughout the hotel, always greeting you with a smile. Can’t wait to go back .",5,2020,02,22
115,"Excellent stay, Friendly staffs ","We are very happy at The Bloomsbury. We have an amazing stay, staffs have been fantastic, particular Than - the manager, Ivan - door men, Fabio - the restaurant manger and Congratulate to rest of the team, good team work in place. 

Food is amazing, location is great, closed to many attraction. One of the best things is people remembered our name from last stay and they recognised us. 

Thank you to everyone and we will definitely return, look forwards for next stay. 

Team, again teamwork is fantastic and very friendly and kind. 

Regards, 
Mr & Mrs Wallis ",5,2020,02,21
115,"Loved the bar, hated the bed","We are returning guests to the Bloomsbury and had a wonderful experience previously. So it was with some dismay that my spouse and I were given a room (214) with an extremely uncomfortable bed. We both woke through the night and had back or shoulder discomfort as a result of the mattress. We are both fit and have no history of back ailments. This was clearly a cause of a terrible bedding. In our earlier visit we had a lovely queen on the fourth floor no problems. I like the location, public spaces and especially the cocktails, food and ambiance of the Coral Bar, a truly lovely room and wonderful place to meet friends. However with such terrible nights sleep I am reluctant to ever return or recommend it to friends.",3,2020,02,18
115,Great Experience,"My stay was wonderful at the hotel, the second time i stay at the hotel and the second time I only have compliments. The location is very good, but what always surprises me is the beauty of the hotel and the kindness and hospitality of all the staff. I really want to thank all the hotel staff, and especially Helder and the reception staff, who are always very kind.",5,2020,02,17
115,Have been staying here for 9 years and still love it,"Besides the incredible location, the staff is what makes the hotel. 

Than - the front desk manager - goes out of his way to make guests feel right at home. He remembers guests by name and takes time to address needs personally. I don’t think I’ve ever met a hotel manager like him and I travel a lot! 

Estelita, Ionut and Victor who run the breakfast room every morning are the highlight of my day. They treat you like family, add personal touches to your order and make sure you are well looked after.",5,2020,02,16
115,Beautiful venue with exceptional staff,"I visited with a colleague a few weeks ago and we were hosted by the event manager Kim. This was a flawless experience from start to finish. Kim is a knowledgeable and passionate host who showed us all the wonderful places The Bloomsbury has to offer. Dinner on the stunning Dalloway terrace was uniqly hosted by Fabio and Alejandro--the type of service that's so subtle and attentive they seem to know what I wanted even before I did! Food was delicious and drinks in each bar before and after were creative and carefully designed to each have their own personality. Every beautiful room, quirky area and fine detail make The Bloomsbury a must visit. I'm already planning my next trip to watch jazz in the basement with a mystical twist! ",5,2020,02,14
115,Very Average for the Price,"Check in was a bit strange. First we were asked for our passports. Generally we don't need them to travel in England so didn't have them but they graciously accepted my driving licence instead. There was also a man behind reception watching us intently, which was slightly creepy. They asked for credit card and put a hold of £1000 on it which seemed very steep. Perhaps they had mistaken us for international criminals. Before I arrived, I filled out the preference form asking for a quiet, high room hopefully so we got some sort of view. We got a room on the first floor looking into the light well just above the annoying humming aircon machinery. The first floor is effectively the bottom of the light well so our 'view' was the wall opposite, a pot plant and the cigarette butts people had thrown whilst leaning out the windows to smoke. This made the room dark and slightly depressing. We complained at reception about the hum of the aircon and they promised to look into it but we never heard anything about it again so I suspect they didn't care. The size of the room was small, even for central London and the decoration uninspiring. There was meant to be a turn down service but we only got this on one of the three nights. We used the coral room cocktail bar.  The room is lovely, the cocktails some of the best I have had but they were quite expensive. Fine, I didn't mind that because it was my wife's birthday but was shocked when I got the bill and found they had added a service charge. I don't think I have ever had this, even in the American Bar at the Savoy. The best of this hotel was the breakfast.  Staff were attentive and the food good. I did give my feedback and they 'apologised' and said we could have free upgrade next time but I'm not interested. We visit London every year as my wife was born nearby and I used to live there but I doubt we will use this hotel again as there is better for nearly £1000 for 3 nights.",3,2020,02,12
115,Excellent Customer Service,"The Bloomsbury is a vibrant, chic hotel that I always enjoy staying here. I have stayed in The Bloomsbury many times with work and Gunilla Olausson always makes me feel so welcome and like it is a ""home away from home"". Over Christmas Gunilla gave me an up-grade and also a beautiful advent calendar as well as a Christmas greeting. This care and customer service is above and beyond and for this reason I will also book The Bloomsbury hotel in the future when working in London. Thank you to all the lovely staff and also to Than Min who looked after me while waiting for my next flight , he arranged a glass of wine as well as minding my bags while I took a phone call. I always enjoy my travels to London but mostly because I am staying with the wonderful staff in The Bloomsbury. Thank you",5,2020,02,12
115,Surprised me,"I was pleasantly surprised with this place. The staff were really friendly and helpful, the room was adequate, the bed was so soft and comfortable, the bars were both relaxing and very accommodating and the breakfast just right. Couldn’t have had a more smooth time.",5,2020,02,11
115,"Comfortable, friendly and clean","Only stayed one night but would use again.  Room overlooking courtyard area on 7th floor so very quiet, no traffic noise.  Room comfortable, well equipped and clean.  I would use again although I checked out early as there was travel disruption (storm Ciara) and didn't have breakfast.",5,2020,02,11
115,A perfect stay,"We couldn’t fault our stay at The Bloomsbury at all, it was perfect. The hotel is in a great location  and the rooms are lovely. The breakfast was also great and the team in the breakfast room were superb, very hospitable and friendly.
Even when there was a slight issue with the room (which was not the hotels fault at all), it was dealt with swiftly and professionally by Than. 
Thanks for a lovely stay, we will certainly be back!",5,2020,02,11
115,Wonderful hotel!,"I stayed here for 2 nights and it was a delight. I booked a “cozy room” for solo travelers and it was lovely with a comfy bed and marble bathroom. Service is great from bellhops to reception to bar staff. Everyone is helpful and polite. 

I booked the car service from Heathrow to the hotel and after a red-eye flight it was a godsend. 

I also enjoyed my martini down in the bar and checked out the rambunctious Coral Room on my way to bed. The breakfast is plentiful and the full English kept me going all day! 

It’s a great location for the British Museum, which was my main target. 

I’ve also stayed in the sister hotel in DC’s Dupont Circle and am now a big fan of the Doyle Collection!",5,2020,02,08
115,Back in the lovely Bloomsbury Hotel ❤️,My second or third visit in this hotel and could’t think of staying anywhere else. Had a lovely dinner for one in the hotel restaurant (delicious risotto by the way!) and enjoyed a beautiful 8th floor room. Happy again 👍,5,2020,02,04
115,"Excellent location, could be cleaner","The great: The location is hard to beat, and overall, this is a cute boutique hotel. The breakfast downstairs was excellent, just like the cocktails at the bar. 
The good: The rooms are nice, but quite small and the shower is awkward to use.
The bad: There were a couple of dirty towels in my room, and one of the breakfast plates was very dirty (covered in peanut butter at the bottom). 

I'd probably stay here again though.",4,2020,02,04
115,Great event at The Bloomsbury,"This is a lovely hotel with several areas to relax and enjoy.  

We held an event in the Seamus Heaney library and the staff were brilliant - despite several changes of timing for the food etc they remained polite and helpful and accommodated everything we asked for.  Special thanks to Nicu, Samir and Veronica for putting up with my changing requests!",5,2020,02,04
115,Great theatre stay,"Great weekend stay at The Bloomsbury whilst in London to see Harry Potter and The Cursed Child. A very warm welcome from the staff on arrival who took our bags for us before we even got to the front door. We were able to check in early (around 11am) which was great. The location is ideal, just off of Tottenham Court Road, where there are many shops and restaurants but as it is just off the road it is very quiet. Tottenham Court Road tube station is just a few minutes walk away. The room was spacious and comfortable with a mini bar, complementary water and hot drinks and biscuits. Very comfy bed. Bathroom was small but perfectly fine. We requested a quiet room and got just that. The lounge area was a nice touch with a lit fire. There was a wedding on whilst we were staying but we would never have known if it wasn't for a sign stating so. The only reason I haven't rated 5 stars is due to breakfast being very pricey at £20+ pp for continental, but I guess it is a 5* hotel and Central London...
We would definitely stay again next time we're in the area.",4,2020,01,27
115,Amazing Staff,"The entire staff was great, from front deck, to room care, to bar and breakfast staff. Special thanks to Estelita, Maria, and Victor, making it a great start each of my ten days at breakfast.
I will be back in June because of their great care.
Christian Mulkey",5,2020,01,26
115,Lovely Breakfast at Bloomsbury,"I’ve heard a lot of good reviews from my friends at Bloomsbury Hotel. So my cousins and I had our breakfast on Sunday morning at this hotel and we enjoyed it very much. The place is so different from the hotels I’ve been into. It’s like a breath of fresh air since I am staying in a barren place of Abu dhabi, which is desert. I am a fan of an old fashioned buildings which made it more exciting for me to enjoy the ambience. The place is clean as well. I was able to use their washroom, and I can tell that their service is 5star because of how clean and organized their washroom is. (I’m always an observant when it comes to loo- though I came for a food but it’s a plus factor for me)

The superb part was the staff were all accomodating and welcomed us with their warmth. If you’re a tourist that’s what you always want to get when you enter a restaurant. You don’t want to feel like a tourist and you want to feel like you’re just a local. As I observed, they treat everyone equally even if you’re Asian or Western. I personally asked their names to give them credit for their service. Thank you so much Ms. Estelita, Luminita, Simona, and Valentine. 

They have also variations of food that gives you more choices. If you order something from their menu, you will know that it is personally made with passion by the chef.
I am 100% recommending this place if you are going to visit London in the future. 😀",5,2020,01,26
115,Location and style,"Stayed here on a group tour. The location is great, with an easy walk to everything. The room was well equipped with tea and coffee, usbs by the bed and good air conditioning. Room servicing was a bit haphazard with some days it being done very well, and others not so well. Breakfast is excellent with a great choice of cooked options including not in the menu items.  Breakfast staff variable- some very attentive, others not so. Coral Room is good for a drink but can be noisy.",5,2020,01,24
115,excellent location and personel,"I stayed a few times at this property, some times all was perfect, but this last time was dissapointing...
My room had a constant mould smell and not enough place to put my things.
Bathroom , quite bad, every time I had a shower, half the floor floaded and the windows did not work ..
Do not stay in room 212
Best thing about the hotel is the great people who work there.",4,2020,01,21
115,Wonderful hotel,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Bloomsbury. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and extremely helpful.  The concierge staff was great; they kept us on time and in the right place throughout the week.  The staff at the breakfast room was delightful. Estelita and Maria were cheerful and welcoming, and the food was delicious. We’ll definitely be back to the Bloomsbury.",5,2020,01,20
115,Excellent,"Stayed here for my wife,s birthday and it was amazing from start to finish.  The location, atmosphere and ambience first class. Room was full of character in accordance with the rest of the hotel. Food was superb. The following members of staff deserve a mention due to their impressive customer service.....Alessia.... Alexandra....Paulo....Estelita.....Jonas...Victor....Luminita and John Kelly who organised the entire stay.  Take a bow all those mentioned and many many thanks for the memories.  Will be back for sure.",5,2020,01,20
115,Excellent hotel in the heart of London,"This is the second time we have stayed at the Bloomsbury, this time to celebrate my sons 21st birthday. We booked three rooms for our family and we have nothing but praise for the hotel and the staff. The rooms are beautiful, really comfortable and very quiet and nothing is too much trouble for anyone. The location is perfect, only a 10 minute walk to Covent Garden and with so much on the doorstep. I would have no hesitation in recommending the Bloomsbury and I'm already looking forward to our next stay there.",5,2020,01,20
115,Great Location But Hotel Itself Could Improve,"We stayed at this hotel twice about 6 years ago and it was great, so we came back to this hotel again for this trip. The hotel had changed a lot - they moved the reception to a much smaller area to make space for The Coral Room, which took some of the glitz off when we arrived at the hotel. Our hotel room was quite a bit smaller than the previous rooms we had last time and the shower water pressure was so weak that it wouldn't even wash the soap off us. All in all, it just wasn't the same experience as we had 6 years ago and unfortunately, it was a worse experience. The saving grace was that the hotel was centrally located, which took us to almost anywhere we wanted to go in London. The Tube station was right around the corner and Oxford Street was at our doorstep. It was within walking distance to visit Seven Dials, theatres on Charing Cross Road, etc. The location of the hotel was very convenient. Another saving grace was that the hotel made great cocktails. We spent hours in the Coral Room relaxing and enjoying each other's company. However, we might give Raddison Blu a try next time - it is on the same street as Bloomsbury. ",3,2020,01,17
115,Great to be back at the Bloomsbury!,"Excellent hotel in the heart of Bloomsbury that we have used many times.  We were in a Classic room - fairly small, but comfortable and well appointed.  The staff are exceptional, and nothing is too much trouble.",5,2020,01,16
115,Great Hotel in London,"Every experience at this hotel was positive.
I arrived early and a room was made available straight away. It may have helped that January is not their busiest month.
I booked a twin room but because I arrived early the room was a double. They quickly separated the beds and remade it as a double.
Due to my status on my hotel booking site i was allowed a late check out. The staff at reception allowed me a 6.00pm check out to work in with my evening flight.
In addition there were some extra touches such as beautiful cakes in our room on the first night and chocolate on our bed each evening of our stay.
The hotel itself is is like an English club with rich warm colours and subdued lighting. My son said a little too subdued.
Rooms are not large but this is expected in an oldish building. However the room and bed was more that comfortable.
One word to describe staff - excellent. All staff were very friendly and helpful.
There are many different places to stay in London but i think this is one of the best. Close to the Thames, Oxford Street shopping, restaurants, theaters, museums and more. In London position is so important.
We didn't eat at the restaurant in the hotel but it was always busy.
The hotel is just off the main road so is very quiet.
This hotel will not disappoint if you want to stay at a hotel with character.",5,2020,01,15
115,What a great surprise!,"Perfect location in the center,  very close to everything you want to see and do in London.
Receptionist Roxane is a delight, she did everything she could to make us feel at home! The ""top of the top"" is having a drink prepared by the sweet and ultra professional Manon in their amazing Coral Bar.
Exquisite food, very good taste in decoration, all in one, an amazing surprise!",5,2020,01,14
115,Excellent,"Great location, walking distance from the center and near the underground. Good service and staff hospitality. The room is small but nicely design. The breakfast is excellent. We'll definitely be back 🇬🇧🇮🇱",5,2020,01,11
115,"Lovely hotel, amazing hospitality","We've just returned from 4 nights stay at this execellent hotel. From the moment we checked in to the moment we left, we were treated with the most amazing respect and attentiveness. The room that we stayed in was execellent. The bed is one of the most comfortable we have ever slept in. The food that we ate was absolutley delicious. Every single member of staff that I met was very helpful and friendly. I have been blown away by just how brilliant thier attitudes were and found the whole stay very humbling. They were all fantastic, but I must give a special mention to Than & Ivan from the front desk, who were both an absolute delight. 

I would recommend this hotel to anyone,and I cannot wait to return. Thank you very much and keep up the execellent work.",5,2020,01,09
115,Bloomin’ Lovely,"We’re regulars to London but this is the first occasion we used this hotel, and we were not disappointed. In fact, the hotel, service and staff were superb. Besides the lively coral bar, Galloway bar and cocktail bar (yes we just had to try them all) there’s also a quiet, secluded and delightful sitting room. 
Will definitely go back. 

Thank you bloomsbury",5,2020,01,09
115,Amazing service,We had rented a flat from 12/27-Jan 2 that turned out to be very dirty.  We walked into this lovely hotel and asked if they had two rooms for 6 nights.  They indeed did and proceeded to take us to four different ones so that we could decide for ourselves which 2 would best be to our liking.  Then they waited for us to make a decision.  Our decision to stay was the best of all possible options and the staff as well as the lounges were amazing.  Thank you for saving our holiday. ,5,2020,01,08
115,"Lovely, historic hotel in theater district","Loved this historic boutique hotel in the heart of London's theater district. Friendly staff, well appointed rooms, good internet, lovely breakfast room, terrace restaurant and the Coral Lounge. Quiet at night, responsive staff and concierge (especially Brian and Ivan), always very helpful. The staff in the breakfast room always remembered us every morning, greeted us warmly and seemed to know what we wanted before we asked for it. Special shout out to Dimiter, Estelita and Victor for great service at breakfast. Hotel was close to theaters, museums, the Tube and shopping, all within walking distance.",5,2020,01,08
115,Mr. Steve Bourg,"Just spent 6 nights at this wonderful hotel, in a great location, the Bloomsbury district, 2 blocks fm British Museum which is free and I went 3 times, maybe the best in the world, for priceless, ancient artifacts. 
Breakfast staff for 6 mornings were terrific, I made sure to get their names—Maria, Veronica, Luminita, Valentine and Ionut. 
Very special place, we liked it immensely!",5,2020,01,08
115,Ionut Luminita,"Ion was our Server at breakfast for seven mornings at The Bloomsbury and he is an absolute delight.  He has a devilish sense of humor and he helped keep us smiling the entire visit.  Each day we enjoyed him more and more   He has energy and goes the extra mile for his customers.   My coffee cup was never empty.  We’ve had a great experience at The Bloomsbury overall and Ion reinforced the high quality reputation of the hotel.   
Sincerely,
Clarke Aburn - Room #621",5,2020,01,08
115,The most delightful hotel I’ve ever stayed in!!!,"I’ve never made a TripAdvisor review before but just have to for The Bloomsbury Hotel. My family, friends, and I all stayed here as we were in town for my brothers wedding. It’s really hard to know where to begin because this has been the most amazing stay! Here are some highlights:

-The BEST and most helpful staff ever! We absolutely LOVED breakfast each morning with Ionut, Maria, Ibrahim and many other lovely staff members who were so patient when we arrived late, were so kind and went above and beyond to make our experience sooo special!
-The Coral Room: absolutely gorgeous, cozy, beautiful ambiance, amazing drinks
-Delicious food in all restaurants at the hotel 
-Comfortable, luxurious rooms with heavenly baths!!
-Loved having the Nespresso machine in the room!
-All around beautiful decor and the most beautiful lounge area in the lobby - smelled amazing, cozy, loved the fireplace

Overall, 10/10 experience definitely made by the absolutely wonderful staff. Everyone was spectacular and so warm. Thank you to each of you!!! I will certainly be back!!

115,London visit during 3 days,"Wonderful experience at the Bloomsbury hotel, very good located, close to the centre and near the British Library, confortable and quite hotel. Staff very helpful and friendly. Amazing Coral room bar !",5,2020,01,07
115,Great Stay,"This is my fourth or fifth time staying at Bloomsbury, I come in for work and stay for leisure. The property is gorgeous and the staff are fantastic!

I find the lounge very convenient for a quick bite and drink. The included breakfast is very nice with some cold items and then made to order items such as an omelet. My two favorite things about this last stay were the concierge who selected excellent restaurants as I gave them a challenging ask to find Christmas pudding in the first week of December. Second, we had some trouble with noise on the weekend due to Christmas parties and the front desk promptly moved our room with bellhop assistance. We found the new room to be very quiet and equally suited our needs.",5,2020,01,05
115,Best stay ever,"We enjoyed the best stay that we have ever had over new year’s at the Bloomsbury and we looking forward to returning again. We often stay at the Bloomsbury, as it is good value in a central location, but this time the service and amenity came together to make a memorable and relaxing stay.  Thank you to the Bloomsbury.",5,2020,01,05
115,"Great Hotel, Luxury Boutique Style But Very Full Service","My stay at the Bloomsbury was amazing from start to finish. The hotel staff was very helpful, from check in to check out.  My favorite part of the stay had to be the Coral Room and the Bloomsbury Club bars.  The property made it so we could have a non-hotel feeling for drinks every night before going out in the city, which I love.  My wife and I stayed here on the last leg of our honeymoon and they certainly made it feel special. There was a complimentary upgrade and welcome champagne and treats in the room. Every day we had amazing staff in the breakfast room downstairs and the food was phenomenal.  The staff of Miariah, Victor, Simona, and others, we great! I will definitely be recommending this hotel to friends visiting London, and will be back this summer!",5,2020,01,04
115,Great home base in London,"Well located, affordable and superbly welcoming staff and environment. We had a great time staying at The Bloomsbury. Upon early check-in we were provided a curiosy room to relax after a long overnight flight from the US. That was much appreciated and needed. The staff in the Coral Room and Terrace were very pleasant and those were great places to relax after hours in the city. The rooms were clean, comfortable and the entire property is well maintained. I would recommend it to anyone and would stay there again.",5,2020,01,04
115,Nice,"As a regular of The Bloomsbury hotel :
_ interesting location;
_ nice amenities;
_ entertaining design bar;
_ professional yet friendly service at the terrace  restaurant.

I highly recommend the doorman José. He is simply welcoming and dedicated.",4,2020,01,03
115,Great experience,"Stayed here on new year’s eve with my boyfriend, the staff were so lovely and very eager to help with whatever we needed. We were able to leave our luggage at the hotel before checking in and after we’d checked out so we were able to look around london. After watching the fireworks we did not return back to the hotel until around 1:30am, we then ordered room service which arrived quickly. The room was lovely, with a large TV, as well as the room being well stocked with all the essentials. It was located just a short walk from the shops so was easy to find out way around. I could not recommend this hotel more.",5,2020,01,02
115,Sister Trip to London,"This is by far my absolute favourite hotel I've ever had the pleasure of staying in. I've stayed several times on business but for this trip I brought my sister and her best friend and my partner. We were allocated an interconnecting room and the team even surprised my sister with a special birthday welcome! Thank you!
We dined on the Dalloway Terrace the first evening, which was beautiful and The Coral Room do the most delicious cocktails with a great atmosphere! There was live jazz music the night we tried.
Breakfast each morning was also so so good, the pancakes are a must! Thank you Bloomsbury team, we cannot wait to come visit again!",5,2020,01,01
115,Great experience ,"We stayed for a few days and were so happy with the experience. The rooms were amazing and the employees were even better, especially Camille who was so helpful and sweet!! She gave us great recommendations for things to do around the hotel. We definitely plan on coming back and staying here again! ",5,2019,12,31
115,Cocktails!!,"Great hotel, wonderful staff.  They gave my little one a really cute teddy bear on arrival and left milk and cookies in the the room for her before she went to bed.  Magic!!

Superb cocktails at the coral room some serious bar tendering skills too!!

Top stay.  Full Jackson seal of approval!",5,2019,12,31
115,Great location,"Arrived christmas day for 2 nights. Room was very pleasant and large. The concierge were very helpful. The breakfast offered wide selection at reasonable.price. the gym was well equipped. Great location. Near theater and shopping, all in walking distance. Coral bar is nice ,not more. Unfortunately the whiskey bar (which was one of the reasons we went there in the first place)was closed for the holiday. This was not mentioned at time of reservation however, was refunded for drinks ordered in the coral room at checkout, which was nice.  
All on all ,very pleasant stay. Worth the value.",4,2019,12,31
115,Post Christmas Weekend Stay,"Had the absolute privilege of staying here the weekend following Christmas. Myself and my partner stayed in the luxury suite on the 6th floor over looking GreatRussell Street. 
We received a very warm welcome from the concierge and the staff on reception when we arrived, who were more than happy to assist in anyway possible. 
The suite itself was very comfortable and very spacious. The bath in the room was a personal favourite of mine! It was refreshing to stay in a room in London that had so much space! There was little no no noise from outside or other rooms for that matter. The suite has all the amenities that could be required (toiletries, iron, hairdryer etc)
I must note that all staff throughout the hotel were pleasant and chatty and should be praised for this. 
The location of the hotel is nothing short of perfect! It felt like it was a stones throw away from everything and had exception transport links with the nearest tube being less than 5 minute walk away. 
I would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of staying in the areas ",5,2019,12,30
115,What an amazing stay in the Bloomsbury!,"My daughter was celebrating her 13th birthday in December so we stayed in the Bloomsbury Hotel. I can say the hotel for us was a key highlight of the the trip. We arrived starved so went for a bite to eat in the Coral Bar which is divine and very atmospheric. The hostess arrived with birthday cake for my daughter, unprompted. 

Jose was a delight to meet. He was so friendly to both of us, keeping us entertained with super, interesting chats. He so kindly left a birthday teddy and cake in our room when we arrived back that night. 

The hotel is a fantastic location for shopping, Oxford is just around the corner and eating, with Convent Garden 5 minutes away. 

Everything about the hotel was fantastic and the staff went above and beyond making it such a special trip. Thank you for making it such a memorable trip!",5,2019,12,30
115,The very best service,"We have not stayed at any better hotel. The personal was professional, yet at the same time, most friendly. They went out of their way to make our stay a most pleasent experience.

It is a very charming hotel with a good proximity to many attactions.",5,2019,12,30
115,Perfectly located!,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury as it looked nice and modern on internet but this place is really much better than it looked at first. Perfectly located at the corner of Oxford Street and Charing Cross Street, just a minute walk from Tottenham Court Road Station, you can easily reach Leicester Square walking and you are close to the British Museum. The area includes a lot of different dining options. The hotel is very well refurbished, very nice hotel staff always ready to help with a smile. In one word or in thousand, it’s the place to stay in London!",5,2019,12,29
115,"Great place, great staff","We are a family of four from Denmark 
that stayed for four nights just before christmas. We really enjoyed it - nice and spacious room and the staff (Maria, Victor etc.) were all super friendly. The location is great for both shopping and for instance the British Museum nearby. ",4,2019,12,27
115,Amazing hotel with incredible staff!,"We had an unforgettable experience when we visit this hotel twice! Our first time was on my birthday on Dalloway  Terrace and second one we decided to stay for a weekend. When we arrived a very friendly and smiley doorman (Pavel)  helped us with our luggage and leaded us  to reception where we had a very enjoyable welcome check in with Than and Emanuel.The room was very cozy. The building has something special and all the staff we met were incredible. Special thank you as well for concierge Ivan who helped us a lot during our stay. I want to mention the bars that have a very unique atmosphere with amazing cocktails and food, and the birthday cake was delicious!!!!  Thank you once again, definitely we will come back!",5,2019,12,26
115,Christmas eve drink,"Each Christmas eve my husband and I choose somewhere nice to have a drink. In previous years we have visited Claridges, The Savoy, most of the top hotels in London. The Coral Room at The Bloomsbury beats them all! The decor is stunning, like stepping back into time to the Art Deco era. Pleasant smiley staff greet you and serve fabulous cocktails. The bar manager, Simone, came to chat with us, showed us the restaurant which was so pretty. He was very good at his job, making the guests feel welcomed and valued. It's because of Simone and the other bar staff that we shall be back and will spread the word of such a nice drinking establishment. The tunes playing in the background were good too. Well done The Coral Room.",5,2019,12,25
115,A stunning hotel stay,"We have stayed at the hotel many times as The Bloomsbury emanates a rare combination of style coupled with a warmth that is felt from the moment one walks through the door. The ambience of the hotel is matched by such a dedicated and attentive staff that it is difficult to choose just one aspect of the stay, or a specific individual who exceeded expectations. We would therefore especially thank Maria, Estelita, Viktor and the breakfast team plus Andre and all at The Dalloway where we were looked after so well. Such a great pleasure to be greeted by Brian and his concierge staff and meeting up again with Gunilla. An outstanding stay in an outstanding hotel. Thank you all.",5,2019,12,24
115,Best afternoon tea!,"Such a Christmassy magical experience for our London afternoon tea, every detail with every piece of food and attention from the staff was next to none. So impressed by the decor but most importantly the food and the way the food has meaning too! 

Highly recommend to anyone wanting a magical experience with friends, family and couples! 

The food was exquisite! 

Thank you so much to Chris, Sundar & Sjord",5,2019,12,23
115,Perfect stay,"My sister and I stayed here for a night recently and loved it. The room was stylish and nice and quiet. Brian looked after us as soon as we arrived and kindly showed us the hotel’s function rooms as we both work in events - George V room is beautiful! We enjoyed a relaxing gin and tonic in the cool bar downstairs before heading out and really loved the breakfast spread in the morning! Would definitely stay again and recommend to friends, for the bar on its own as well as the hotel stay.",5,2019,12,23
115,Pre theatre meal,Brilliant location for the Dominion theatre & Tottenham Court Road tube. Staff were lovely. The food was excellent. We used the Terrace which was pretty & atmospheric for Christmas. Hotel bar was beautiful. ,5,2019,12,22
115,Emanuel and Ivan were the perfect hosts,It was an amazing time. I was in summer with my family. The hotel was great. Emanuel was literally helping us with everything. He made us feel at home. Ivan gave us advice about the city. We will be back.,5,2019,12,22
115,A Wonderful Place,"I stayed in the hotel before I moved into my University housing. It was a truly lovely place with wonderful staff. Ivan, Pavel, Emmanuel, and Madalina were all so wonderful and helpful––whether it was helping me move my things or giving me advice on where to go in the city. Their kindness made the Bloomsbury Hotel and its two affiliated bars staples of my five months in London. This hotel will always be a special place for me, like a second home. I would definitely come back again.",5,2019,12,21
115,Christmas Vacation ,"This is our 2nd visit to the Bloomsbury hotel and we were very impressed with both the exceptional level of customer service and hotel amenities. The service level of your team Maria, Dmitar and Victor in the dining room was outstanding. The bars were amazing and we tried several new cocktails with your mixologists both in the Club and new Coral lounge. We look forward to visiting again on our next trip to London. ",5,2019,12,21
115,Well worth a visit,"I have lived/worked in London for many years and I know the area well.  This hotel has a fantastic location coupled with great staff and facilities.  The bars and restaurants give a lovely experience which is reasonably priced for being in the heart of London. The staff have a can do attitude and are extremely helpful.  The building and decor give a welcoming feeling. So if you don’t know London this is a great place to base your self

Grazie mille, ragazzi.😁
See you on Sunday afternoon😉",5,2019,12,20
115,One of the nicest hotel experiences I've ever had.,"I know that the title of the review seems a bit of a boat to live up to, so let me explain...

I travel quite a bit for work, and I've been blessed enough to stay in some nice hotels. After a while, most hotels tend to look alike, and the experience is more or less the same.

The Bloomsbury, however, is a different level entirely.

From the moment we arrived, to the moment our Uber had arrived to collect us, the staff at The Bloomsbury were warm, friendly, and incredibly considerate. Nothing, and I mean this genuinely, nothing was too much trouble. We were always made to feel valued, to feel special, and every member of staff that we encountered had a smile on their faces, and went out of their way to help us in any way whatsoever.

One special mention has to go to Estelita-Maria, who took good care of us during breakfast. She was amazing in the way she took care of anything we needed. She also happened to be incredibly funny (and also quite small!!!). 

The room was gorgeously furnished, with a lovely view over the London rooftops, towards the BT Tower. Heated bathroom floor, MASSIVE television, and an incredibly comfortable bed.

We had the nicest time at the Bloomsbury, despite only staying couple of days, and were a little sad to leave.

Thanks to all the staff at The Bloomsbury for making our stay a fantastic experience. We hope to stay again at some point.",5,2019,12,20
115,"Thank you, every little detail was amazing and incredible!","We came to celebrate birthday! They make sure to make it so special, every little detail was amazing and incredible! Thank you for BD decors and cake. The room, the atmosphere , all the facilities and the food was unbelievable and it was the best service ever. They take a very good care of us all the time, every corner had a smile for us! If we could rate more than 5 stars we will! :). Big shoot out to Than, Emaneul, Ivan and all the staff for making our experience unforgettable! We didn’t ever wanted to leave! We apreciatte all the details, definitely we’ll come back!",5,2019,12,20
115,Another fantastic stay,"From Check In at Reception and for our 2 night stay on 6th and 7th Dec everything was really well done.Staff were very welcoming,Room was lovely,food also very good,especially Breakfast where the staff their were ever so professional,Maria,Estelita,Ionut,Victor and Simona.Must also mention Brian,the Concierge,what he doesn't know about London isn't worth knowing,what a Star.Gunnilla,who is the Manager runs a very good ship,with a magnificent staff helping her keep the standards at a very high level.THanks to everyone,will we be back on a regular basis.",5,2019,12,20
115,Bloomsbury,Hi I just want to thank Estelina and Maria for great service at the Bloomsbury and my stay was excellent overall the place was clean they helped me with all the issues I had .and they were so understanding when I arrived earlier then expected,5,2019,12,20
115,Wow wow wow the Bloomsbury hotel is a Stunning hotel. :),"So I’ve stay a few times now I absolutely love this hotel, so warm and welcoming. Beautiful fragrance as you walk in. Staff was superb so sufficient and very helpful too. Food was amazing, Can’t wait to visit again.",5,2019,12,14
115,Lovely stay,"I had a lovely stay at the Bloomsbury and highly recommend it. Great service from Naleet and Vasko in particular, though everyone was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The room was quiet, very comfy bed, not enormous space but big enough, bathtub (yay!), and plenty of electrical outlets, which I love. The bar in particular was a standout. Great service at the bar, tasty snacks, lively scene with live music both nights I was there (I think they have it Thurs-Sat), and really fun, inventive drinks. It was upscale and well-appointed throughout but not stuffy. I usually stay at the Zetter Townhouse in Marylebone, but my colleague wanted to try the Bloomsbury so I went along. I’m so glad I did. The vibe is similar but it’s bigger so there’s more going on. And Bloomsbury isn’t far from Marylebone — Central line tube is right next to the hotel — and the price point is lower, better value for the money. Truly the service was above and beyond. Nothing was too much trouble, and they seemed genuinely happy to have me there, which is especially nice on a business trip. Loved it. ",5,2019,12,14
115,Restaurant booking in advance is essential,"Booked for it's closeness to the Dominion theatre, we arrived early but lovely staff checked us in and took care of our case.  On returning, there was a different receptionist so we explained what we had done and were handed the key, we asked how to get to our room and were told ""take the lift""
The room was large with all you would expect but while the bathroom looked great, on closer inspection it was in need of tlc - eg:something had been taken off the wall in the toilet and left marks on the tiles.  while the towels were soft - the bathrobes were rigid!
Not having to walk far to the theatre, we rang down to book an early dinner but the small restaurant was full - while the confirmation email had asked if we wanted to book, we waited to see what was nearby, apparently a week's notice is essential.  We asked for recommendations for an alternative but the suggestion was not local so we chose Room Service, a drink we ordered had been discontinued so we asked if we could have our ""Guest of the Day"" free cocktails - NO.
Dinner arrived 20 minutes before the time we had requested but better than late!  So we went down to the Coral Bar, a fuss was made over getting a table, menus left and then we were ignored for 15 minutes, my partner tried to order at the bar but was told it was table service  - we sat reading the bad reviews....by the time we got our drinks we had to down them and leave!
On returning, we went down to Bloomsbury Club bar - what a difference!  Fabulous staff and great service!  A very good jazz trio playing live, excellent range of cocktails in a great setting and what we had expected.
Breakfast was also excellent, great staff and a huge choice - we really felt nothing was too much trouble.
On checking out we mentioned our disappointments and the service charge was waived and staff were sympathetic - luckily the good out-weighed the bad but the rating only just got out of average.",4,2019,12,14
115,Bloomsbury Revisited,"Probably a year since we’ve enjoyed this jewel in London’s former heartland. Last evening’s dinner in the Dalloway restaurant was a treat in terms of both the standard and choice of dishes and wines. The service however remains the outstanding component (thank you, Krystijan). As ‘old friends’, the staff and management have throughout the establishment made us feel so welcome and a little guilty for having left it so long before revisiting. 

Similarly, breakfast this morning was more an friends’ reunion and an absolute pleasure to see Marie and Estelita again. Certainly we shall not so long before returning!",5,2019,12,14
115,Family trip to London,Had a wonderful trip to London and stayed in this beautiful hotel. It is so central. The staff were just brilliant and so helpful. From the doorman who greeted us on the street when we go out of our taxi to all the staff we met throughout our stay. They were so friendly and helpful. Breakfast was fabulous with such a great choice and wonderful food. I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely return. ,5,2019,12,12
115,What a wonderful anniversary stay,I chose the bloomsbury for my two year anniversary with my wife. I had just mentioned it was a special occasion but this hotel went all out to make it extra special.Upon arriving our check in was speedy and the staff were so helpful. upon arriving in our room we found chocolate dipped strawberries and a lovely message and later came back to find rose petals covering our bed. our room was spotless and the bed was so comfy. the bars downstairs were beaut as is the dalloway terrace which is amazingly decorated. thank you so much! v well located and just lovely,5,2019,12,11
115,"Great service, lovely food! Highly recommend.","Veronica & Caoimhe were very helpful and provided excellent service before, during and after our event. The food and drink was amazing too! I definitely recommend hosting a business meeting here for 10-20 people.",5,2019,12,11
115,Weekend stay,"Booked for a special birthday weekend treat and a birthday cake was left in the room - lovely gesture!
Was a shame and nothing to do with the hotel but the bin lorries could be heard loading outside in the early hours of the morning and woke us up with bottles crashing in the road below!",4,2019,12,10
115,Great hotel! Highly recommended.,"My daughter and I stay at The Bloomsbury for 6 nights and our room is absolutely wonderful. 
Breakfast is lovely with a good selection. Service is faultless.
We are served by Ionut, Victor and Estelita everyday. Ionut remember our preferences and he takes the initiative to order it for us without asking. Small and thoughtful gestures count and I appreciate it.Thank you!
However, housekeeping service could be better improved. We were awaken by the sound of trolleys, doors opening and closing loudly, vacuuming and people talking as early as 7.45 am. We went to bed late at nights and we tend to sleep in and wake up a bit later.",4,2019,12,10
115,Take it from me...,"I start this review with the caveat of having stayed in a slew of hotels around the world. Having worked in the entertainment industry, I've had the great fortune of staying in some of the best places, both known and unknown. The Bloomsbury hotel is hands down one of the greatest experiences I've had while on holiday...ever.

The hotel itself is that of a dream. Each custom room is as aesthetically enjoyable as the next. The linen is luxurious, the floors in the bathroom are heated, the carpet is plush, and the closet is spacious. We had tons of space to maneuver and comfortably exist without feeling crowded or cramped. Being centrally located, the amenities were endless. The gym, sitting room, multiple bars, library, etc. were all accessible and kept in the same pristine standard that is threaded throughout the make of this fine establishment. Every sense is awakened from the moment the doorman greets you; sight (the decor/design is exquisite), the scent is divine, the house-beverage is refreshing, and every surface you touch is immaculate. 

The staff is 5 star. From the moment we arrived, Tahn Min greeted us, got us checked in, and escorted us to our room. He made himself available for all that we needed and provided a level of service that only a very selfect few master; visible enough that every need was met but not overwhelming enough that we would feel smothered. He is pleasant and accommodating and worked effortlessly to make sure our expectations were exceeded. His staff were phenomenal. Special nod to Alessia for your assistance in helping us as well. Truly appreciated.

The dinning service patrons became family by the end of our stay. Living somewhere for an entire week makes one somewhat dependent on the resources around them. The staff tentatively recognized our likes/dislikes, allergies and such so quickly that they were able to make recommendations knowing what would and wouldn't work for us. A part of the joy I experienced each day came from interacting with them all each morning at the start of the day. Thank you so much Maria, Estelita, Ionut, Victor, and Simona. You all were personable in every sense and left a lasting impression. 

The bar(s) were an experience in themselves. From the Coral Room and its impressive decor/delicious cocktails to the lower level bar an it's craft, well, everything, you are sure to discover something you've never had before that will instantly make you a fan. And not to give too much away, but there's a special something in the lower bar that will assist you on ""making up your mind"" on a cocktail specially suited for you.

Without a doubt, The Bloomsbury will be home for us anytime we find ourselves across the pond again. Be it for holiday or work, I'm the best me when I abide there and that's simply due to an amazing staff that works to ensure that I have what I need to be just that. Do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in the experience of The Bloomsbury.",5,2019,12,09
115,"Stunning hotel, perfect location, amazing staff","Arrived via cab, dragging my suitcase, doorman runs to greet me and carries my small but heavy luggage, slick and quick check in, I asked advise on shops and was given directions that were easy to follow. 
Room was small - I was in 404 but beautifully decorated, and spotless. And I mean spotless. 
Perfect temps - this was December after all and the room was lovely to walk into. 
Nespresso, large tv on the wall and loads of great touches from the hotel. 
Outdoor terrace bar has table top heaters so toasty warm even in December sat outside 
This hotel is 1 minute from oxford street, theatre district, tons of restaurants, tube a minute walk, just as good as it gets. 
In short the staff fell over themselves to make me feel welcome, beautiful hotel, spotlessly clean everywhere and thanks to its triple glazing, despite the chaos outside that is London, I never heard a thing. Perfection all round",5,2019,12,07
115,Superb!,"I recently stayed at the Bloomsbury and I cannot recommend this hotel enough. Great rooms, great food and friendly and attentive staff. I must make a special emotion to Ore on reception, what a lovely soul, not to mention a consumate professional.

115,Perfectly Amazing,"We had a short weekend stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel and the experience is amazing. When arrived, the staff warmly welcomed, helped to carry our bags and take us to reception. Than at reception desk managed to find a room for us to early check-in which make our stay more pleasant. The room is quite and very clean. We had fantastic time in The Coral room, the bartender Marion is very knowledgeable about spirits and we appreciated her hospitality. Location is very close to Tube stations and many retail shops.

115,The best hotel in central London,This hotel is lovely. I use it quite a lot to have dinner with friends and clients. Also they have two bars that I really like to use and sometimes they play music. Customer service is excellent. I really recommend this place.I always feel welcome in this hotel as the staff look after me as if I am a special client.,5,2019,12,06
115,Lovely Hotel in central London,"Attended for a business meeting. Lovely hotel with very friendly and helpful staff, especially the doorman, Jose, who could not do enough for us. Difficult to rate lunch and dinner as it was catering for a corporate event, but breakfast was excellent. Room compact, but you expect that in central London, however it was very comfortable and had everything we needed./",4,2019,12,04
115,Most comfortable bed ever,"The hotel entrance is a little hard to find (it is easier to find the hotels Coral Bar one), but once you are in the staff were very welcoming and friendly / helpful at all times.
The lifts are very slow and dimly lit but once you get to your room the bed was huge and one of the most comfortable ones we have ever slept in (and i am no spring chicken).
Both bars were excellent and unique although the music in the jazz bar was a little too loud if you wanted to talk to the people you are with.
We will certainly be back next time we are in london.",5,2019,12,03
115,Amazing bar,We visited the bar couple weeks ago with my friends. We had a fabulous night with some amazing cocktails and great live music. The service and the venue are excellent we will definitely go back and I can highly recommend to visit it.,5,2019,12,02

Is a place where you are always welcomed, the staff are really friendly and always smiling and always very kind, excellent customer service which makes a difference in Extremely busy city  like London,  here you feel you are a guest and you know you can enjoy the experience.

Moreover, they have live music and it makes my day after a non stop day which is one of the reasons I keep going.

115,Beautiful comfortable boutique hotel with friendly staff ,"This was the first time I have been to this hotel and it was for drinks after an anniversary celebration. My partner and I enjoyed the different themed rooms indoor and outdoors, as well as the live Brazilian music. We found the staff attentive, polite and once we mentioned that it was our anniversary we were waited on hand and foot for most of the evening by JC. We intend to come back to The Bloomsbury again for a xmas drinks.",5,2019,12,02
115,A Touch of Class ,"Had a wonderful weekend stay at The Bloomsbury hotel. It's been refurbished since our previous visit and is now better than ever. The place just oozes class and sophistication, but in an understated way, so not in your face as it were. Lovely attentive staff. We had a studio suite which was sublime. Great breakfast, which was superbly presented. Ideally located for theatre land, Covent Garden, Oxford Street etc .",5,2019,12,02
115,Favourite place to stay in London. Friendliest restaurant staff!,"I stay at The Bloomsbury multiple times per year for a decade now and totally recommend it. The staff behind reception and in guest relations management are excellent, especially Sebastian Annandale. The breakfast team at the restaurant, namely Maria, Estelita, Luminita, Rosetta, Marina, Ionut, Maria and Dimitar, are wonderful, simply the best and deserve a particular mentioning too.

115,Perfect location,"We had a lovely stay at The Bloomsbury and will definitely be back.  When we travel to London we usually stay around Mayfair as i find it a bit quieter at night but decided to change things this time and we were delighted we did.

115,SUPERB SERVICE - BEAUTIFUL HOTEL,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury  for 5 nights in late September, 2019.  Our experience there matches the comments set out in the detailed review by Sleepchik in 10/19.  The hotel is beautiful and very comfortable.  We will never forget the friendliness and service provided by all the staff, especially those in the dining room at breakfast.  Their sincerity, professionalism and ""just right"" sense of humor made each morning most enjoyable. We want to thank and recognize Victor, Jonut, Marina, Maria and Dimitar for their efforts on our behalf.  At the end of our last breakfast at the hotel, Jonut presented us with a box of treats from the kitchen as a snack for our journey to northern England. We were overwhelmed.  These are very special people. It is our hope they are each doing well and that they will have Happy Holidays!  We look forward to visiting The Bloomsbury again in the near future..",5,2019,11,29
115,Excellent hotel ,First time at this hotel. Very pleasantly surprised. Location is of course we celebrated. I chose hotel for location in first place. Staff very pleasant and inviting. Decor is superb. Room (upgraded king) was small but was well acquainted and nice. Overall an excellent choice in London central. Great walking everywhere.  ,5,2019,11,29
115,Supercosy and fresh,Stayed with my husband for a few nights at this wonderful hotel with an interesting history (it used to be a YWCA) with a cultural and royal touch which added to the cosy atmosphere. Our room wasn’t very big but perfectly ok for two people. It was very fresh and clean. The staff was friendly and attentive. The hotel is beautifully decorated with wonderful colours and wallpapers throughout. Very inspiring! Would definitely recommend and stay again. Also the surrounding area is beautiful for walks and also close to shopping areas and sights such as the British Museum.,5,2019,11,28
115,My hotel of choice in London,"I travel to London often with work and always try and stay at The Bloomsbury. The hotel is laid out really well, great location and style. A special mention to the staff serving breakfast, where Maria Victor Dimitar always takes great care and attention of her guests, and Rosetta makes the best coffee!",5,2019,11,28
115,A fantastic weekend stay,"The people working at The Bloomsbury were very friendly and helped me celebrate a special surprise for my wife. I am very grateful to all of the staff at this elegant and relaxing hotel in particular the welcome from the reception, who made the surprise memorable and special. This is of course a quality hotel and the price of your stay does reflect this, however the personality and welcoming nature of the people working there made it a place that I would definitely recommend.",5,2019,11,26
115,Weekend stay in London,"My wife and I stayed at the Bloomsbury for a weekend away before Christmas for some shopping and to see a show. We didn't eat at the hotel, other than breakfast, as we had booked other restaurants. 
Our room wasn't big, but a typical size for central London and very comfortable with everything you need. We were only staying two nights and were out most of the day. The hotel also has some really spacious, well appointed and comfortable lounge areas to use. A nice touch in each room is a brief history of the Hotel, which is very interesting. 
The Hotel's location is hard to beat, literally a 2 minute walk to Tottenham Court Road Underground Station, but the hotel is quiet and nicely tucked away. It's about a 15 - 20 minute walk to Selfridges on Oxford Street
The Hotel breakfast is good, service is quick and friendly. Maria was in charge on the days we stayed and she and her team gave excellent service (Marina, Simona, Victor amongst others). 
The Coral Room is a very lively venue and an excellent cocktail bar. Not cheap, but good quality drinks with waiters and mixologists who know their stuff. 
Finally, the check and check out was friendly and efficient. We got good service from a trainee called Vokas, I think that's his name. ",4,2019,11,25
115,Booked for ROH,"Fantastic hotel, a short walk to Royal Opera House and the main reason for booking here. Immaculately presented hotel and perfect for a romantic night stay. The room was smaller than others we have stayed in but the facilities and cleanliness second to none. ",5,2019,11,25
115,Always a great place to stay,"The Bloomsbury is wonderfully located in central London, with comfortable, clean and classy rooms, friendly, helpful staff, and excellent facilities. The breakfast is wonderful with a great range of choices. Lovely bar, sitting room, and restaurant. Close to everything, and a lovely place to return after a day or night out. We will be back.",5,2019,11,24
115,Another Perfect Stay,"We had another fabulous stay at the Bloomsbury hotel this weekend. Always impressed by the attention to detail, the fantastic service and the quality of the food and drink.

We had a beautiful lunch on the Dalloway Terrace which had been decorated for Christmas, stunning!

Fabulous breakfast and particularly great service from Ionut who is always very attentive and has a smile on his face! Which has to be said for all the staff at the hotel.

Has to be our favourite hotel in London, just don’t tell everyone else!",5,2019,11,24
115,Poetry far from the madding crowd,"The Bloomsbury offers a very interesting combination : the building itself is full of history and one is surrounded by the memory of the great poet Seamus Heaney who donated part of his library. It is located in a large room upstairs. The contemporary touch is brought about in the comfort of the rooms . Don't miss The Coral  bar which is  beautifully decorated, offering sophisticated and fun cocktails mixed with great gusto by the bartenders . And  the Saturday morning  historical walking tour with Janice professional guide is a must if you want to learn more facts and history about the area . ",5,2019,11,23
115,Gorgeous Hotel & Great Location,"I stayed at the hotel as a solo traveler on business in November - and it was just lovely - from the gorgeous Coral Bar to the Dalloway Terrace.

Sumptuously soft bed and lovely hot shower - perfect will definitely stay again. 

Although would request change in room from near the lift as it was a little noisy in the morning.",4,2019,11,23
115,Great Service,"I would like to commend the following staff for giving exceptional service:

Sebastian, the guest relation manager
Maria, Victor, Marina, Estelita & Ionut of the breakfast restaurant. 

Keep it up guys!!",5,2019,11,23
115,Simply amazing!,"I was in London with my girlfriend for my birthday about a week ago and decided to stay in a hotel close to the city centre, The Bloomsbury came up as a second choice, but upon staying there it is now without a doubt my number one hotel to stay in in the city, maybe even the country! When we arrived the entrance was to the side through what I can only describe as a side road, but upon entering we were greeted by a gentleman (Ivan I believe?) with whom I had a wonderful conversation about his hometown. The check in process was swift and efficient. We stayed in a fantastic room on the 4th floor, not much to say about the view but the room was very nice with a quaint rustic feel to it, the shower was a walk in, with a bathtub in the middle. All well maintained and in good order. We went down for cocktails in the Club Bar which was simply amazing, a special thank you to Simone at the bar, who along with his charming manner and deep knowledge made our experience extra special and wished me a happy birthday which was a lovely little touch. 
Breakfast the next morning was great, the buffet was plentiful and all fresh. Maria was on the ball, always making sure our plates and cups were never empty 
Upon check out the lovely young Cyrielle (to which I'm sure I have misspelled like she predicted!) was an absolute gem and along with Mr Tan who I assured that I will be making the Bloomsbury my home away from home",5,2019,11,22
115,LSPN,"This is second time when I came here,I want to mention first the beauty of the George V hall,amazing ideea...

The service during our meeting was excellent and very attentive.Thank you Samir,Ibrahim,Huseyin and Florin for your service.

Choose Bloomsbury for quality meeting rooms and helpful team onsite.",5,2019,11,22
115,Conference hosted at the Bloomsbury,"My company hosted a conference at the hotel, the staff were truly amazing and went above and beyond on the day to assist us with our guests and anything we needed. A special mention to Ibrahim Hussein  and Samir Florin they were both very efficient and helpful, nothing was too much for them and they both went the extra mile to make sure our conference run smoothly and our guests were kept happy.",5,2019,11,22
115,Locations and Service! What more could you ask?,"I recently stayed at the Bloomsbury for a week with a group of friends. We were there to see places and explore the city. We chose the Bloomsbury for its location, right near the Charing Cross Station. We could get anywhere easily. We didn't, however, know what to expect from the hotel. We had great rooms, great service and the amenities of the hotel were also comfortable and varied with lots of choice. The best part was the wonderful staff in the breakfast room. They were thoughtful, attentive and even funny. Thank you Maria, Ionut, Dionitar, Victor, Estelita, Rosetta and Luminita!",5,2019,11,22
115,"Fantastic and cozy, the staff make all the difference","This is a long time coming, as I was there in June 2019. HOWEVER, from the moment of check-in the staff was the fantastic. The room was cozy but very comfortable and well appointed. Everything was very clean without being or smelling antiseptic (this is a trick, it seems, as so many hotels just smell like the cleaning agent  which is awful). 

The downstairs bar is gorgeous, and I am sad to have not tried the English bubbles. NEXT TIME!

The only issue was that the neighbors were constantly going in and out and the doors slammed all night/morning. Not sure if this was just neighbors or also the cleaning staff, but it was frequent enough to be annoying. Otherwise, I would stay here again, but request a quieter room.",4,2019,11,20
115,Exquisite,"We were treated beautifully from the mintue we arrived in the hotel until we reluctantly left. The team were warm, friendly and attentive. Our room was beautifully decorated. Breakfast was truly superb and we were looked after magnificently by Victor and his team. We will be staying here again.",5,2019,11,20
115,Weekend,"This was a business trip with my Husband. Had been before it became the Bloomsbury. Hotel now much bigger but extremely well done. Our bedroom can be described as being small but very nicely decorated. Very clean and had everything one could want but not for a long stay as space was limited. The staff were, without exception brilliant. From arrival to departure we could not fault them. Than who welcomed us with a drink was a surprise and Chris the Pastry chef who made be a bun was an equally most pleasant surprise. Well done all but especially those two who looked after us so well. 
Regretfully the evening meal, which was a function for around 65 people was a disappointment even though menu’s had been advised in advance. Service was a little slow and therefore food was not as hot as could be but generally was not up to the standard of breakfast which was excellent. However, taken as a whole it was very good.",5,2019,11,20
115,Wonderful experience,"From the moment we arrived the staff was very welcoming. The manager on duty, Naleef, organized balloons in our room knowing that we were travelling with 2 small children. Kasper and Helder met us at curbside to help us with our bags and made for an easy check in. The hotel itself was charming and spotlessly clean. The rooms were large and beds very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel. You won't be disappointed!",5,2019,11,19
115,Best Hotel ....Best DoorMan,What a wonderful time at the Bloomsbury....and every time we arrived back Jose was always there to Greet us with his beautiful smile.....and WHAT A GREAT HELP HE WAS.....Be sure to ask and look for him #Jose,5,2019,11,19
115,Amazing stay every time,"The Booomsbury is amazingly located and offers a great value for money. They got spacious rooms and all the comfort possible. The best part about this hotel is its service. The team behind it is simply amazing - all of them are extremely kind, smiling and always ready to help. Special mention - Than who is always available to sort out any of your concerns or demands. a real gem! 
this is my third stay and looking forward to more. ",5,2019,11,18
115,"Fantastic Service, great hotel, Best bar in London and the words getting out!","The hotel was excellent.  We had 4 rooms and they were all great.  Bathrooms are spacious and modern.  Rooms were nice and comfortable.  Management really took care of us with beautiful amenities.  This is our 2nd stay and will not be our last.  Love, love, love the  bartenders in the Coral Room.  Marion and Alberto were the best and everyone is so nice and are on point.  there is a reason the Coral Room is rated so high as well as the Conde' Nast designation in 2019.  Thanks for a great week!  Lisa and Brett M.",5,2019,11,18
115,Linton and Ronelle,"The overall service levels are of an exceptionally high standard. 
The food is delicious, fresh and creative. 
Rooms and bathrooms are clean. 
The staff are extremely friendly, helpful and made us feel very comfortable.",5,2019,11,17
115,Fantastic hotel,"I have stayed at The Bloomsbury for years; mainly on business trips but also personal trips for weekends away with my partner. I can't speak highly enough about this hotel. The property is gorgeous and beautifully furnished, especially the Dalloway Terrace (restaurant) and the Coral Room (bar). Service has always been impeccable but not overwhelming or stuffy. The rooms are comfortable and feel luxurious with marble bathrooms and stylish furnishings. I've had the pleasure of staying in the suites a few times and they are absolutely stunning (see pictures) with a plush bedroom and huge bathroom with marble throughout, two sinks and a generous bathtub.The location of the hotel is great too - right beside Oxford Street, near Soho and the West End shows. I can't recommend this hotel enough!",5,2019,11,17
115,Great hotel,"Beautiful hotel, well appointed, excellent foot and accomodatio. Girls weekend for my wife who came home from London raving about it. Special shout to Ionut for his undivided attention, humour and attention to detail. ",5,2019,11,17
115,The Bloomsbury Hotel,"We had been at the Bloomsbury for 4 days, mixing business and vacation. Great staying, superb room, perfect service, reasonable price, close to the British Museum and Oxford Street, 3 minutes by walk to the closest Tube Station. Excellent.",5,2019,11,17
115,Overnight Stay,I recently booked an overnight stay with my daughter as we were going to the Theatre on consecutive nights. This was our first stay at this hotel and we were very impressed. We were made to feel special from the moment we arrived through to our departure. It’s the little touches that make the difference. We were met from our taxi with a friendly greeting. We were given a free upgrade on our room without having requested it. The room had every comfort. Sky TV was appreciated! (Not provided by the majority of hotels!). The breakfast was excellent and great value if you book direct with the hotel. We have stayed in more expensive hotels and have not had the same experience. The Bloomsbury will definitely be our hotel of choice when staying in London.,5,2019,11,17
115,Wonderful hotel!,"The Bloomsbury is a beautiful hotel. I expressed a keen interest in the portraits in the beautifully decorated lounge area (including works by Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant), and was taken on a wonderful tour of the hotel by Guest Relations Manager Than, to see more of the hotel's works of art, and to learn about the history and literary/artistic connections to this wonderful hotel. The highlight was the Seamus Heaney Library. The hotel cherishes its connections with writers and artists. It is beautifully designed, warm and welcoming, and the food is lovely. I had a really special time. Thank you!",5,2019,11,16
115,The BEST front desk service,"It was my first time staying at The Bloomsbury Hotel, it's a lovely hotel, all the staffs are welcoming and helpful, my boyfriend and I had a lovely stay. 

The staffs at front desk are professional and always try their best to ensure we're happy with our stay.Our check in was quick and smooth. Tringa, the receptionist was so helpful and always with a warm and welcoming smile. Also, thanks to the guest relations manager Than and Cyrielle for making our stay feeling like home away from home.",5,2019,11,16
115,Best Lunch Ever.,I was at bloomsbury last week for lunch at dalloway terrace needed some last minute suggestions for some activities to do with my family. Naleef at concierge was very helpful. He made our day very enjoyable. Great suggestions. Thank you.,5,2019,11,15
115,Anniversary,"Myself and my partner visited The Bloomsbury hotel last weekend for our anniversary and the first impression on arrival was just WOW! The whole image and vibe was so nice and the smell in reception was so inviting! We checked in and we weren’t happy with the room we were in as it was very small( we could bearly move around it together). We called down to reception to see was there any more rooms available as we were just there for one night and explained it was for our anniversary. The Deputy manager on shift Mr. Than was so unbelievably helpful, he arrived up to our hotel door within ten mins and brought us to a much bigger room which suited all our needs it was fabulous and reassured us if we needed anything to let him know. We went out exploring for a while and when we arrived back in the evening the bed was covered in rose petals and a plate of fresh strawberry’s dipped in chocolate which read happy anniversary in chocolate syrup. There was napkins and cutlery left and was so so thoughtful! There was a card left wishing us a lovely stay and happy anniversary from Than and I really think his addition to the team in The Bloomsbury is definitely needed he is so welcoming and accommodating! He was such a lovely man. Thank you Than. It’s the little things that go along way. He made us feel very special.

115,Corporate hospitality - the perfect venue,"We often host corporate conferences at The Bloomsbury as it’s by far the best of its kind in London - it’s a stunning space, great food, excellently prepared and always set up for us exactly to our requests. 

This is largely due to the amazing Ibrahim who looks after us perfectly - nothing is too much of a problem and always makes us feel like VIPs. And such a nice guy! 

Similarly, Samir and Florin have always been utterly amazing, so prompt, met every weird request from us, and just generally been an utter delight to work with.

Kim looks after us in the run up to the event and nothing is too much of a problem, she’ll find a solution to any dilemma - she’s been faultless in every way!

The staff are what makes this hotel (and their beautiful wallpaper and furnishings, but mostly the staff! Thank you to you all. 

Thank you to all the wonderful team collectively - you are all superstars.

115,Great style & service in the heart of London,"I stayed twice in this beautiful hotel for business trips, and had 2 excellent experiences!
Great atmosphere, nice food, and fair value for money.
Employees are dedicated and nice, such as Jase whose grooming and attitude was remarkable! ",5,2019,11,13
115,"Great stay, lovely hotel","We had stay at The Bloomsbury to celebrate our anniversary and truly loved it. The Hotel location is perfect, very close to pretty much everythings,shopping, food restaurants and tube station. The staff in reception is very helpful, thanks to Than & Ivan for their friendly service.

Estamos esperando volver, de verdad disfrutamos mucho nuestra estadía.",5,2019,11,12
115,Hotel room too small,"The hotel is in a great location, staff were excellent and facilities were lovely, one downside is that our hotel room 707 was very small and pokey, very narrow bathroom even though it was beautifully decorated and the room was too small so spent as little amount of time as possible in it, but that's ok, as we loved being out and about in London.",4,2019,11,12
115,The Bloomsbury - a great boutique hotel in London,"The Bloomsbury is a great boutique hotel in London. Close to theatres, museums and other London attractions. Close to public transport. Fabulous decor. Great restaurants. Friendly staff and lovely guest rooms. It is not cheap but does offer value for money. This hotel has style and elegance. If you like hotels with character, this is a great option.",5,2019,11,09
115,Great location,"A lovely hotel in a very convenient location.  Friendly staff and great bars. The room was clean, quiet  and the bed was extremely comfortable. Would definitely return to this hotel. when visiting London again.",5,2019,11,07
115,Something special from another era of elegance,"We were given the gift of a stay at The Bloomsbury to celebrate special birthday and Silver anniversary. The hotel is a Lutyens delight and decorated in the style of the Bloomsbury set. Its glamorous yet laid back, not at all fussy or stuffy. There's a lively crowd in the Coral Room and Club bar and a buzzy atmosphere fuelled by lush cocktails. Dinner in the Dalloway terrace was relaxed and a special place to dine with friends. Well worth treating yourself to a special stay. ",5,2019,11,07
115,"Lovely hotel, excellent location","This is a well kept and well organised hotel in the heart of London within easy walking distance of theatres, shops and museums. We only stayed for one night but everything went very well, a lovely room, very friendly staff and an excellent breakfast. We enjoyed our stay and would happily return.",5,2019,11,04
115,Different experience from previous stay,"Room was great, desk was great, coral room was great, location was great. Club bar was a letdown.
Don’t want  people standing at the bar but only has three barstools and not enough decent table space. The tiny table and stools don’t really cut it ",4,2019,11,03
115,Fantastic stay ,"Wonderful stay in a lovely hotel.
Spacious room, excellent breakfast. 
The location is perfect, you can do a lot of stuff by walk. 
You even have a jazz club, where they are doing delicious cocktail.
Highly recommend this place ",5,2019,11,03
115,"Challenges, but sorted ","Arrived at the hotel around 4p well after check in time and my room wasn’t ready. Once it was it  a handicapped room a) I’m not handicapped & b) these rooms should be kept for people that are handicapped. And the room is rather shabby considering they are meant to be a 4 star, upscale hotel. 

As a result of above I was upgraded to a larger room. While the hotel is lovely, I think in general the rooms need a facelift. The staff did make up for above, by offering free drinks, and comp dinner in Dalloway (delicious). 

Left prescription glasses in the room and if I hadn’t asked about them, not sure they would have been in touch. But they are on their way to me with no charge, which is appreciated. 

Would stay here again and have recommended to others. ",4,2019,11,02
115,Perfect nights sleep,"Lovely hotel, great location and nice and peaceful, will be sure to stay again. 

Bar area and lounge area are gorgeous, roaring fire in the lounge area. 

Would be sure to stay here again in the future, cracking location for exploring central London, tube station a couple of minutes walk away.

115,Fabulous hotel with staff to match ,"This was our third stay at the Bloomsbury. It is our go to hotel when in London. We stayed for two nights on this occasion as a celebration of our birthdays. The hotel as ever was immaculate - clean, beautifully presented. Reception and door staff so helpful- going out of their way to sort out our room when we turned up hours early before check in unannounced. We ate at the Dalloway Terrace - beautiful setting and fabulous food. We took breakfast in our room which was excellent. Drinks in the Coral bar excellent as always. This is how hotels should be run. Many thanks to all staff members who made our stay so enjoyable. We’ll see you again next year ! ",5,2019,11,02

115,Fantastic Private Event,"I attended a small private family wedding event and overall the event was fantastic. We only had a small group and were reserved a specific area downstairs and then had our dinner in the library, which was a fantastic venue for a special dinner. All three courses were exceptional and service was as good as I’ve even seen. Our head waiter was Ibrahim, who catered to our every need, with no task too menial for him to solve. I’ve been to many events and I don’t remember seeing service as good as his. A thank you also to both Florin and Samir, who ensured that the event ran smoothly.",5,2019,10,30

Breakfast was included and had a nice variety to choose from outside of the regular continental buffet.  Had dinner in the terrace restaurant which was very good.  My favorite was the Coral Room - simply stunning, nice variety of snacks to choose from and drinks.  The location was great as we were pretty much in the center of London and the tube station was just a block away.  We will definitely stay there again!",5,2019,10,16
115,Amazing hotel with lovely staff,"I stayed in this hotel for a weekend with a friend the staff on reception were lovely and couldn’t do enough for us. The bar staff however were not as great service was a bit slow when getting a drink on the Friday afternoon.

Upon checkout a lovely gentleman called I believe called Than Alessia was so helpful and friendly and bought us coffee to the lounge are. Great lovely hotel would recommend highly x",5,2019,10,15
115,Wanted to like it more ,"

Yes, it is pretty central.  And yes, it has a beautiful coral bar.  The hot breakfast is very good but expensive (try to have it included in the room rate).  Coffee is good. The downside is the breakfast room has a low ceiling and is quite loud. Extremely capable staff and hostess!

Check in at 11:30 pm was flawless.  
Porters were eager and helpful!

Room rate is what appealed to me and I would say the experience was pretty good for the price with the following exceptions:

Room 207 overlooked alley housing garbage collection and faced an active office building.  Ask for another side of the hotel.

Charging my  phone took forever.  May have been specific to the room. (That said, front desk was happily and professionally willing to relocate me.)

Funny smells in stairwells (cooking food and disinfectant and worse).

Dark hallways with ugly carpet.

HVAC conference in the ballroom.

115,Bloomsbury team are the best!!,"We had a family three days in London after a whole trip by car in the UK. London is always busy but Bloomsbury is an amazing island in the middle of it all.

Than, Ivan and Roxanne are an amazing team they Simply made this stay something to remember. Thank you.",5,2019,10,14
115,Great property and location,"We had a great stay here.  Hip hotel with great restaurants and bars.  Had dinner at the Dalloway terrace, and Federico was a new server - he was excellent given we were some of the last people in the restaurant and the power went out!  Great new server.  The hotel was lovely!  Location is walkable to just about anywhere (we went to Westminister, the ferry, Kensington and a few others within a mile or so).  Would definitely recommend!",5,2019,10,14
115,Not what I was expecting,"This was my 3rd visit in less than a year. Sadly, I suspect it will be my last for quite some time.  As a solo traveler, I'm fine with the smaller layout of the typical Bloomsbury room (at least the ones I've been booked into). Still my last room convinced me it's time to book elsewhere.  This particular room (one with a low number X-03 for example) had a window that faced directly onto the airspace.  To make matters worse, that window also faced the window on the common hallway from the elevator, which meant that anyone could see into my room (and basically my bed) from the hallway if I left the curtains open.  It felt very exposed and public.  The common stairway was directly across from my door and the room itself was a basic square with the front door opening directly onto the room's sleeping area. I felt I had to keep both sets of curtains tightly closed at all time which made it even more claustrophobic.  There was barely room to set up a luggage rack for my bag.  The coverlet for the bed was shabby with numerous loose and broken threads hanging from it.  

I would have asked for a better room but a family member was arriving to check in so I asked that their room be better situated.  It was, marginally. Their room looked out on the alley way, which was a bit more private...at least until the rubbish pick-up began in the early morning hours.  

I finally managed to secure a table at the Dalloway Terrace but found the food underwhelming and arrived cold.  

Avoid rooms on the low floors and with low numbers--the latter will put you up against that air-shaft with no light or views.",3,2019,10,13
115,"Amazing stay at ""The Bloomsbury""","We had a lovely stay at ""The Bloomsbury"". The hotell is very charming with great facilities. It´s also a must to mention the amazing breakfast.

115,Wonderful stay at The Bloomsbury,Great hotel and with lovely rooms and great accommodations. Staff are very friendly and helpful.  They go out of their way to provide information and assistance.  The sitting room and the bars/restaurants are terrific. Breakfast is wonderful-not to be missed.  Very close to the British Museum-a not to be missed experience.  Highly recommend this hotel-very fancy.,5,2019,10,10
115,Luxury and comfortable staying ,"It is a big pleasure to stay in this hotel every time I am in London. 
Beautiful and spacious rooms, nice and friendly personnel. Breakfasts are delicious. 
The hotel has a very good location. 
However, wi-fi doesn’t work well all the time. 

Well-designed and comfortable hotel. 

",5,2019,10,10
115,Perfect Home Away from Home,"Every time I’ve stayed here for work (typically a week+) this hotel provides the perfect atmosphere. It’s big enough with multiple bar areas to allow for a feeling of space (one not always allotted in big cities!). The staff is as friendly as you need, they go out of their way to greet you and remember your face.  Rooms are nicely updated and relatively spacious. Only downside is I wish the rooms got more natural light.",4,2019,10,09
115,Exceptional customer service,"Very happy that The Bloomsbury lived up to, and indeed exceeded my expectations from reading the good reviews online. The staff in particular are exceptionally good and the hotel is very very nice too.
The location is very good for Theater Land, Soho, Oxford Street shopping and much more.",5,2019,10,09
115,excellent location and great staff,"stayed at the Bloomsbury for 12 days in Sept/Oct ... good facility, excellent location, but the best feature of the stay was the hotel staff ... all well trained and pleasant at all times ... breakfast was included in our room cost, and the food and staff here were superb ...Maria, Rosetta, Marina, Ionut, Luminita and Victor made each morning something to look forward to ... we would not hesitate to book here again ... Peter and Nicole Mills",5,2019,10,09
115,A fabulous hotel in a great location,"A truly lovely hotel with attentive staff to look after your every need. Our room was quiet with a very comfortable bed and contained everything you'd need during your stay including a coffee machine. The food in the Dalloway Terrace Restaurant was delicious so it's worth reserving a table prior to staying to make sure you're able to eat there. We found the breakfast catered for every need with a wide array of foods on the buffet as well as some tasty dishes on the menu. The cocktail bar was oppulent offering an impressive list of drinks. The location of the hotel is excellent and we were able to walk to Covent Garden, Oxford Street and many more local attractions. We would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2019,10,07
115,Lovely boutique hotel ,"This was my first visit to England, and London. My travel agent picked this hotel, and I’m thrilled she did! I can’t wait to go back for another stay. 

The doormen/bellmen were friendly and helpful. I think I met most of them in the 2 days we were there. Michael and Abudi were just great. Helped with bags, taxis, restaurant suggestions; anything I needed help with. Brian and Naleef were concierges I believe, and again, were just so friendly and helpful. I had great interactions with the front desk staff as well; Vasko and a young lady (I forgot to get her name). Again, friendly and helpful. Literally everyone I interacted with in this hotel was friendly, helpful and professional. I can’t say enough about the staff and the warm service they provided. 
The hotel itself is incredibly charming. Warm, comfy, but still unfussily upscale. When my dad and I got there, we wanted lunch but didn’t want to walk far. Abudi suggested the hotel restaurant, so we gave it a try. As a business traveler I generally avoid hotel restaurants, but I must say, this one was great! We both had the endive salad with blue cheese and walnuts, which was crunchy and delicious, with a nice vinaigrette accompanying it. 
Next was fish and chips, which was glorious! The fish was perfectly fried and tasted totally fresh, and the chips were amazing- I ate mine and then stole some of my dads. To accompany this was fresh mushy peas, which I had never had. A light taste of mint and some fresh butter made this a lovely accompaniment to the fish. 

Once we got in our room our bags were delivered, and then we relaxed for a bit. We decided to have dinner out, so I asked Michael for suggestions, and he gave us two, but after further discussion we landed on a proper English pub, called Jack Horner. It was a fantastic suggestion and my dad and I had a great meal with perfect beers to top it off. 
The next morning we went downstairs for a good breakfast, and we ordered a proper English breakfast. It was soooo good. Then we ordered cappuccino made with cream (keto) which they happily obliged. It was delicious. So much so we had another one. Lastly, our waiter brought us an eggs Benedict, which was truly delicious and perfectly rendered; I had it with bacon and my dad with salmon. All four servers/managers/helpful people were again, top notch in taking great care of us and our needs. We want to recognize Ionut, Victor, Maria and Marina for their excellent service. It was a perfect way to end our stay at this delightful hotel! 

The room (I should mention) is beautifully appointed, with lovely and unexpected details. The size of the room and bathroom was just right for the 2 of us.

 The detail and thought put into this hotel truly sets it apart. I can’t say enough about it. 

I really had no expectations for this hotel, but I was blown away by the location, the service, the property itself and the beautiful little details that make all the difference to a tired traveler. 

I really can’t wait to go back to London, and will be staying at The Bloomsbury when I do. Thanks again for such an unexpected experience. You guys rock ;) ",5,2019,10,07
115,Great Staff and Ambiance,I checked into the Hotel on very short notice. The staff was well awre of the special circumstances an accomodated us to the highest standards. A big thank you! There support was exceptional and went far beyond the word duty,5,2019,10,07
115,Restaurant staff,"The best thing here was the staff in the restaurant especially Marina, Marina, Ionut and Lumimta who were happy, helpful and very efficient and a great pleasure to come down to breakfast in the morning, making you feel welcome and at home.

115,Business EMAP,"Really beautifull hotel,perfect location and nice meeeting rooms.We had a meeting there with EMAP and everything went perfect from service until the last thing needed in the room.Very beautiful buffet presentation and tasty food.Special thanks to Florin and Nicu for service.",5,2019,10,06
115,I have the opportunity to stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel a few times a year. It is and has been truly lovely.,"My experience is that they have done whatever it has taken to assist with whatever my needs have been. The staff have been wonderful Thank you Ionut, Maria, Victor, Manna and Luminita and all the teams at the front desk and events. You have been great to work with.",5,2019,10,06
115,EMAP Event,"Lovely event space, I was there for an event organised by EMAP. It was for the first time when I stepped into this hotel, but I can assure you is not the last. Everything is so lovely and the standards are very high, we were located on the ground floor in George V ( what a beautiful room). Catering area it was on lower ground floor where Florin was running the show with his team. Thank you Florin for the excellent service you and your team provided. So disappointed I couldn't attend the drink reception (had to catch my train...). 
Thank you Bloomsbury",5,2019,10,05
115,Nice Little Hotel,"Not the best location. I would pay more to be closer to the attractions and the heart of London. The drivers who dropped us off and picked us up had a hard time getting there.
It is a long walk to see anything from this hotel.
The rooms were nice and the staff were nice but not our cup of tea.",3,2019,10,03
115,Lovely Hotel,"The hotel is stunning and we were given a lovely welcome. Our room was ready before check in and we got upgraded to a suite (room 703) however I think there was a reason we were put in this room! We weren't given the smith extra of the two cocktails so I had to deal with it on check out. The room had a reading light missing so hole in the head rest , the electrics were playing up so our lights were turning on and then going off . The room itself was lovely, nice size, comfy bed and great amenities. Its a stylish lovely hotel just a few tweaks need doing. Breakfast was good but I probably would go out for breakfast next time as over priced for what you got.",5,2019,10,03
115,Sharon Purvis,"We stayed for one night on Saturday, unfortunately having to cancel Friday. My daughter and son booked this as a treat and it was absolutely lovely. We were fortunate to be upgraded to a Studio Suite arranged by Cyri, Than and Alessia. The hotel and staff are fabulous. Service is excellent, beautiful surroundings and the suite was stunning. We will definitely be going back. Thank you so much everyone",5,2019,10,01
115,"Fab location, excellent atmosphere",This was our first visit to the Bloomsbury and it most definitely wont be the last.   Beautiful hotel with staff that are a credit to the hotel.   Location was just perfect for everywhere we needed to go.  Very cosy and comfortable bedrooms which included Nespresso machine which we love.,5,2019,09,30
115,"Great location, even better service","Flew in from an overnight flight as many do and was greeted by Than at the front desk. Great sincere greeting, found us a room to check in early and make the most of out quick two night layover in London. Breakfast downstairs well presented with nice local flavor allowed a seamless day to appreciate London for the day as we have before. Can'y speak well enough of the service Than provided and his attitude will certainly be a reason for our return.
",5,2019,09,30
115,The Bloomsbury comes up trumps again,"We have been staying at The Bloomsbury, Great Russell St, since 2001.  We lived in Kent for seven years before returning to Australia.  Each time we visit the UK we stay at this great hotel.  You feel you are special and not just a paying customer.  Brian, Head Concierge, is magnificent and can arrange anything you want, theatre tickets, train timetables, etc.  we had afternoon tea in The Dalloway Terrace and a number of light meals in the Coral Room.  All in all, another great stay.",5,2019,09,30
115,A gem of a hotel,"Such a lovely hotel.  Superb staff, all very friendly and attentive.  They remember  your name!!!!
The hotel is warm, and welcoming.  Original art, fresh flowers, sitting room with a fireplace.  If you enjoy small, boutique atmosphere, historical 20's, great location, this is for you.  1 minute from tube stop.

Great experience!!!",5,2019,09,29
115,An anniversary weekend to remember!,"I checked into the Bloomsbury with my partner to celebrate our 1 year anniversary & we left having had the best time imaginable. Put simply, we were treated like royalty... Than Min (the guest relations manager) is an absolute hero & a true gentleman. If everyone who worked in the service & hospitality industries were more like him, the world would be a much better place. For example, there had been a mix up in our booking (via an agent) that meant we had been allocated a room with two single beds. Than instantly resolved this, upgrading us to a lovely room with a bath. He also sent some delicious chocolate dipped strawberries to the room & wrote us a lovely anniversary letter that we could swap for free cocktails  at the bar. Later, when we had issues with our TV, Than came to the room, promptly fixed it & provided more free cocktails. He really made us feel special & I can’t thank him enough... Special mention to Alessia on the check in desk too; a friendly, welcoming & helpful presence.
The hotel itself is exceptional; stylish, elegant, comfortable & spacious. It really is 5* quality. My partner is an occasional travel writer for a national newspaper & even she (having stayed in some incredible places) was blown away by The Bloomsbury. 
Also, the breakfast was 10/10. We will be back & I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a special London getaway. Absolutely first class!",5,2019,09,29
115,Wonderful Place!,"I stayed here for six nights with three other friends.  We had two rooms next to each other.  I cannot say enough good things about this hotel.  The food is excellent and the terraces for dining are so pretty.  The staff is what made it for us, though.  Each person in their individual responsibilities were so gracious and attentive.  Dale was kind enough to walk us to a shortcut to the theatre when he saw that we had enjoyed ourselves a little too long at dinner to get to our show on time.  And we made it!  Brian steered us to a wonderful High Tea with little notice, Fabio was so engaging as our wine sommelier,
Luminestia, with her beautiful smile, brought us our room service items, and the list just goes on with our appreciation to the wait staff from those attending to breakfast to dinner.  You cannot go wrong staying here.  It's wonderful!",5,2019,09,28
115,Perfect hotel in London!,"I stayed at the hotel for five nights with my 7 year old daughter for a business and pleasure visit and he had the most amazing experience. This hotel is the best hotel I have ever stayed at for many reasons: The location is perfect near a tube station and Oxford Street but very quiet. The room was comfortable, beautiful and very clean.you have everything you can possibly need or want in the room and it was well equipped with a Nespresso coffee machine and a kettle for tea with a variety of tea bags and complementary cookies and bottled water. We had an issue with the water pressure that was fixed immediately to our satisfaction. 
The breakfast was incredibly good, fresh with many option to choose from.
The most amazing thing about this hotel is the staff. From the minute we arrived we were taken care of so well. The staff addressed any requests we had very quickly and with a smile. I have never been at a hotel that treated my daughter with such kindness and respect, she was so happy to be there.
I want to express my sincere appreciation to Tahn the manager who went above and beyond for us and also to the dinning room staff who learned my daughter's favorite dish very quickly and served it to her without her needing to ask and all that with a warm smile. Thank you so so much: Victor, Maria, Esielita and Lumimita (I hope I got all the names correctly :))
We will definitely come back again!

115,Great hotel in unbeatable location.,Perfect location for exploring London and good service. Tasteful breakfast and fine rooms. A special thank to Gunilla for a warm welcome despite technical problems at front desk upon arrival. Highly recommended.,5,2019,09,26
115,"Lovely hotel, amazing staff","We have often stayed at the Bloomsbury on trips to London. This time, when we visited in July 2019, there was a mix-up with our room reservation that we had made through  Expedia - we were one room short, and at the peak of the summer, it would have been impossible for us to find accommodation elsewhere. Than and Alessia at the front desk were very very helpful - they managed to find us a room in the hotel at the same rate that we had originally booked at, despite the hotel being nearly at full capacity. We're looking forward to being back there soon.",5,2019,09,24
115,Overnight team building event,"The hotel was comfortable good facilities in the room but it was quite small and I found the bathroom cramped. The staff were very polite. The breakfast options were excellent however the evening meal in the restaurant was expensive the quality was poor and one of our group was kept waiting for over 30 minutes for there food only to be asked to order something else, it is supposed to be a markup pier white restaurant but does not live up to the name",4,2019,09,24
115,HARRY POTTER LIVED HERE,"Spent one night here when going to a West End premiere. It's a 5-star hotel and the cost reflects this. Booked a double room at the cheaper end of the price scale and very disappointed to say the least. The room itself was tiny with just enough space around the double bed to walk round. Seems ridiculous that a 5-star hotel would provide double beds when most hotels these days supply king size. One desk in the room which was cluttered with so much stuff we couldn't put anything on it. No usable plug sockets on one side of the bed either. My partner and I felt very claustrophobic in the room, not helped by the dark decor either. The wardrobe also contained a load of clutter and when the door was opened we couldn't walk between it and the bed. We named the room ""the cupboard under the stairs""!! Lighting was also an issue. It was very dark and gloomy in the room. The bathroom was small and looked dated. A shower over the narrow bath, which did not maintain it's temperature, going hot and cold at times. The sink had a tiny surround to it, which again was cluttered. We had to put stuff on the floor to be able to put a minimum of our toiletries on the top. Had a very poor night's sleep on the small bed, which was also quite uncomfortable. That evening we had a couple of drinks in the bar. Two white wines each at £9 a glass plus a service charge of over £4. Central London prices but why are we charged to be served!! The breakfast was included in our room price and was another disappointment. We both opted for the full English which came out suspiciously fast. Parts of it were lukewarm, and most of it was low quality ingredients and quite bland. Overall this was not a good stay, especially at the price of £320 for one night.",3,2019,09,24
115,Weekend trip to see a show,The Bloomsbury hotel is located near theatre land in the heart of London close to Kings Cross. The lounge and all the bars are comfortable and easily accessible.  We booked a small double which was adequate for one night. The beds are comfortable and the bathroom had walk in shower with gowns and slippers provided. Only small complaint was a very large screened TV which blocked the mirror. Staff are welcoming helpful and very friendly.  We were booked straight in even though we arrived 3 hours before official check in time. Would recommend this hotel for romantic weekend trip to London but maybe go for the bigger room.,5,2019,09,24
115,Bloomsbury Hotel,"Loved the Bloomsbury.  Perfect location for vacation but if I had been there for business I think I would have been equally as satisfied.  Great ambience, Menu was varied and staff were helpful and friendly.  We walked to the British Museum which was basically around the corner., and easy access to anywhere we chose to go including the Underground. Highly recommend it. ",5,2019,09,23
115,Bloomsbury club breakfast,"Amazing staff, always accomodate.
Special thanks to Ionut, Victor, estelita, luminita and Rosetta!  See you again soon ..from the difficult customers .... You handle our demands so well... 😊
Banging sausages ....",5,2019,09,22

115,4 day stay,"This was my 3rd stay at the Bloomsbury. The staff were helpful, kind & courteous and went out of their way to accommodate any special requests.  The location couldn't be better with Oxford St, Covent Garden & Soho on your doorstep.   ",5,2019,09,21
115,London Fav,"Quiet, modern rooms, great restaurants and bars, and super professional staff - this is one of my favorite hotels in London. I can always count on a great experience here.  It’s always great to hear ‘welcome back’ and know that the Staff acknowledge repeat customers.  ",4,2019,09,20
115,We slept well and walked everywhere. Location hard to beat.,"4.5 So glad we stayed here! The location is hard to beat, it's around the corner from the tube and Oxford street. To it’s left are Tottenham Ct. Road and Oxford St. with lots of local restaurants and shops, and to its right, the British Museum and student neighborhoods. Too many eateries and places to buy necessities within a block or two to name. The hotel itself is a good size, with a gorgeous restaurant and bar that was a fresh menu. Our room was on the small side, but so quiet. Very comfortable bed we slept off our jet lag very well. The bathroom was good, the shower had a splash guard you need to be careful with. But that may be a European thing. Lovely and helpful staff. The a/c worked very well. The outlets need a little updating, but other than that it's perfect. I recommend this hotel to all.",4,2019,09,20
115,Absolute Gem of a Hotel in the Heart of London,"This is hotel is such a gem.  Lovely furnishings, stylish bar, and very accommodating staff.  Rooms and bathrooms were great.  We especially loved breakfast every day and always looked forward to being taken care of by Estelita and her wonderful staff.  ",5,2019,09,19
115,Guerlain event,"I could write a lot from how professional everyone acts and how clean is this hotel,But I really want to mention your events team.Events team did a great job in managing this event,nothing was to much for them .George V looks absolutely stunning and all the events space is amazing.I would like to say a big thank you to Florin and his team for making everything so easy for us.Thank you Bloomsbury team and see you all next year",5,2019,09,18
115,Guerlain event,"Amazing staff, good food, good service in a wonderful George V Hall event space.Everything went so well and nothing was to much for your staff.Special thanks to Florin and Samir for running the event so smooth for us,They made us feel that we belong there.PS:George V looks amazing.Thank you",5,2019,09,18
115,The fabulous Bloomsbury Hotel,"We loved being at this hotel as everything and everyone was amazing.  We loved its fabulous entrance and waiting room with a fireplace.  The bedrooms were just as beautiful and clean as the entrance.  We particularly loved the breakfasts as the food was excellent and the help was friendly, courteous and attentive.  This is one of my all-time favorite hotel experiences.",5,2019,09,17
115,A place to return to — business or pleasure,"We had a great stay in the hotel for a few days. it’s a beautiful hotel with great interior and stunning facilities, like the jazz bar in the basement and the Coral Room restaurant. The rooms are very clean and nicely decorated. The bed and matress is good. The breakfast is exceptional, we have hardly experienced anything like it in other hotels in London. The service staff is doing a fabulous job, they are extremely attentive, professional, yet friendly and everything runs very smoothly. Thank you Estelita, Ionut and Marina for the warm welcome at the breakfast every morning. Being in the hotel business myself I can only say that this hotel with such friendly staff is setting a benchmark.",5,2019,09,16
115,"Great experience, with stand out staff","Had a great time at the Bloomsbury and thanks to Camille for looking after us...

Staff, were top notch, friendly, efficient, helpful, just the right balance. Rooms are quirky (although 621 could do with a wall mirror in the room somewhere to dry your hair according to my wife, who is an ""expert"" on the lack of correctly placed hotel room mirrors ;)) The food in the Dalloway terrace, and the breakfasts in particular were excellent. Overall just a lovely hotel, a little bit different, with a style all of its own, making a nice change from the large ""chains"" hotels that abound these days.",5,2019,09,16
115,lovely london hotel,"we enjoyed our stay at the bloomsbury in september 2019. we appreciated the close proximity to the british museum as well as being walkable to restaurants and pubs. our room was comfortable and a decent size for a london hotel room. our only issue was the very narrow and slippery bath tub that requires you to use a glass door that only covers half the shower space. it leaves you quite cold with water spraying all over the bathroom. also, the lack of a top sheet on the bed was a bit disappointing but we have since learned this is a UK thing. (we just get a little hot without the option to throw off the duvet and still be covered by a sheet!). we had breakfast at dalloway terrace which was so picturesque and delightful. we also really enjoyed cocktails in the coral room with its vibrant decor and fun vibe. would recommend the bloomsbury to anyone looking for a comfortable place to stay with a good location in london.",4,2019,09,15
115,Lovely hotel in great location,"We spent two nights in this lovely hotel.  We chose it based on reviews and the fact that it was close to the theatre we were attending. The rooms are very comfortable and the hotel has a great ambience, although a bit dark in places (the lighting in the lifts could be better).  The staff are all really helpful and attentive.  This is a luxury hotel and the service is as you would expect. Great location.",4,2019,09,15
115,The Bloomsbury,We have just returned from a night at the Bloomsbury we had a fab visit and will definitely be back. The hotel is in the perfect location surrounded by lots of fab restaurants and bars. The hotel itself is lovely and the staff are so attentive - we were particularly impressed by Thane who went out of his way to help us several times (what a lovely man).,5,2019,09,14
115,Lovely outside drinks,Had a great experience at The Bloomsbury where we were escorted to the terras. Here we were helped by Giuseppe. He was attentive and we had a lovely conversation. Nice place to have some drinks and food.,5,2019,09,14
115,I just want to say thank you,"This hotel is absolutely incredible and it’s staff are so polite and willing to go the extra mile for their customers even when they don’t need to. I would like to personally thank Than, Jasper and Alexandra for their amazing service today. They are honestly the best and it would be my pleasure to stay at this hotel again.  They are so helpful and polite even when they are super busy, I would highly recommend staying at this hotel as you will not be disappointed. 

Thank you again for all the help today. 

Fátima",5,2019,09,14
115,Exceptionally enjoyable stay,"Wife & I stayed here for several days prior to cruise. Virtually every segment of our time here was positive. The ""trainees"" were terrific. Early check-in after early am arrival from USA was relatively smooth. Our room was very nice and room attendants were superb. The on site restaurants were a bit expensive, but food was cooked & presented perfectly and service was beyond reproach. Location is almost ideal for visitors/tourists while being in a relatively quiet (if that's possible in London) location. We wish you well!",5,2019,09,12
115,Beautiful Hotel,"The Bloomsbury is in a great location within walking distance to many pubs, restaurants and attractions. The accommodations were clean, quiet and comfortable. Definitely visit the Coral Room during your stay! ",5,2019,09,11

We had a suite with a huge bathroom and lovely walk-in shower, there was even a tv you could watch from the roll top bath. The room itself was lovely with good facilities and beautiful quality sheets. 
We enjoyed a light bite supper with cocktails in the Coral Room and then went down to the Club room for the live Jazz which was excellent.
We would like to thank the guest services team, Thaw for the strawberries, the staff in the Coral Room for looking after us so well & Madalina in particular and everyone else  who made our anniversary so special. Also a big that you to the turndown lady for the lovely romantic rose petal heart in our room 312. Thank you it’s these little touches that make you the best hotel!",5,2019,09,11
115,"Class, attention and convenience","Having visited this hotel several times in the last year  we have been pleased each time with the standards of service, cleanliness and general value.

115,Wonderful service!,"Our large family group was warmly welcomed to this delightful haven tucked amidst London's hustle and bustle, close to everything, yet a respite at the end of the day.  From the front desk, to the concierge, bellmen, and our patient and out-of-his-way-helpful daily breakfast waiter (Iohut Victor--he was great with our three, somewhat-rowdy young boys), we were well taken care of from start to finish.  Our rooms were appealing, clean, and comfortable--the bathroom's heated floors were especially delightful each morning.  Will definitely return if life brings us back to London!",5,2019,09,09
115,"Good location, excellent customer service","My wife and I spent a great weekend there. The location of the hotel is very good, the theatres and restaurants are in easy walking distance, British Museum is a stone throw away and Tottenham Court Road underground station lies just around the corner.

Our room was very nice and equipped with everything we needed. Comfortable bed and surprisingly quiet surroundings. 

The Coral Room cocktail bar is worth a visit even if you don't stay at the hotel. 

One thing that has to be mentioned was the excellent customer service. Everybody was very nice and helpful from first hello to the check out. It was our wedding anniversary and the staff did everything to make it special for us. They surprised us not once but many times :) 

Will definitely come back!",5,2019,09,09
115,Hasn't let me down yet,"Stay there when overnight for an all day  meeting the next day and it has never disappointed, esp since all the refurbing seems nowe to be finished.

115,Wonderful Stay,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay! My room was clean with thoughtful touches and the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. The decor and general ambience of the property is very welcoming. Would definitely return!,5,2019,09,08
115,Fantastic Hotel and Service,"We stayed in The Bloomsbury for my partners 50th Birthday- as part of a holiday over from Australia. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel at home, special and attended to. The Coral Bar was a beautiful place to sit and enjoy a wide array of classic quality cocktails. Wait staff are attentive knowledgeable and very personable. All the staff were like this. We stayed in a Classic Kingsize Room which was not large but quite big enough for us. It was very clean, beds very comfortable. We are a same sex couple, and we felt extremely comfortable and happy, they even put rose petals on our bed!! Wonderful wonderful people!!!
So, obviously it is not cheap to say at this beautiful hotel, but it is worth every penny!  You can see exactly what you are paying for, attentive service , beautiful surroundings, excellent food and drinks . If I had one suggestion to offer it would be that there were more vegan options in their menus, although they did accommodate us quite well in this regard, there is room for improvement. 
I would recommend this lovely hotel to anyone!!!!

115,"Centrally located, and excellent","We have just had a very pleasant stay here.  It is very central to London, 2 minutes walk to the nearest tube station, and you can easily walk to Covent Garden, Th British Museum, Oxford Street and Picadilly Circus.  If you like walking (as we do) then Rengents Park and Hyde Park are in range too.
The hotel rooms are comfortable, the bed was great, and staff are excellent.  Couldn't be faulted.",5,2019,09,06
115,Awesome!,This hotel is absolutely beautiful. It’s in a perfect location near the British museum and within walking distance to pretty much all the major boroughs and attractions. You must visit the coral room.,5,2019,09,05
115,"Incredible location, excellent staff.","My Wife & I stayed here for one night and wished it was longer. The hotel is extremely well kept, clean, grand and located in a great location just behind Tottenham Court Road tube station. All of the staff were excellent, from the cleaners to the check in staff; they couldn't have been more helpful and friendly.",5,2019,09,03
115,"Great hotel, excellent location","Great hotel in a excellent location, close to the British Museum, we walked everywhere during the weekend. We were upgraded to a suite, which was really amazing. The suite was beautiful and the staff really friendly, we really enjoyed our stay ",5,2019,09,01
115,Bloomsbury,"Great rooms and ambience in a central London setting. The hotel is very conveniently located close to West End theatres, museums, and the underground. Particularly impressed with touches such as the small pastries provided in the room on check-in and the nespresso maker available in room. Highly recommended",5,2019,08,30
115,London Love,"My home in London.
A flair of the good old times. A taste of London at it’s best.
Perfectly located just next to Tottenham Court Road, The Bloomsbury Hotel finds it self really in the middle of everything.
Super central, close to Oxford Street, Regent Street, The British Museum, but also my favourite hidden gem, Charlotte Street.

The hotel have just renovated many of it’a features, where the real crown must be The Coral Room. A vibrant, heritage-styled super chiq bar where you need to spend some time to sensitively take in London as a Londoner.

Great breakfast, friendly and professional staff.

115,Double suprise,"Arriving at the hotel on my birthday, I was greeted by the reception staff with friendliness and professionalism. The staff on duty were trainees but watched over by their supervisor, the hotel need not worry about these people they were very good.  The young man checked me in, telling me I had been upgraded and was in a deluxe room. He also pointed out that since I was a regular I could choose to have afternoon tea on the hotel.  I accepted, who wouldn't, and when i took it the staff treated me like a VIP.
This hotel always treats me extremely well.  When i turned up at the Bloomsbury Club late one evening, it was busy and standing room only. Simon found me a table and chair from somewhere and made sure i was looked after all evening.
Thank you to all the staff.",5,2019,08,29
115,Beautiful hotel in a great location!,"We stayed for only a short time at the Bloomsbury (unfortunately).  It was in a great location to the areas we have frequented in London and also looked like a very nice comfortable hotel.  To be honest, the pictures make it look older than it is.  It felt fresh and welcoming and classy, but in a slightly old-school London way (which we loved).  
The room was very clean, very nice and had plenty of amenities.  The bed was very comfortable, which is high marks especially from my wife. 
We didn't get to experience the dining options, but they looked excellent and hope to come back to enjoy the food and dining offered. 
Highly recommend the Bloomsbury and look forward to our next stay!",5,2019,08,29
115,Great as expected!,"Me and my husband stayed in this hotel from Aug 19th to 21st! I read a lot about it and the experience was exactly what we expected! GREAT location, wonderful staff. We absolutely LOVE the Coral Room bar! Our room was small but of well we are in London not Texas LOL 

Super helpful staff, they let us early check in and late check out and they hold our luggage till 8.30 pm on last night!

Location is wonderful! For sure I will recommend this hotel!",5,2019,08,28
115,A amazing London hideaway,"The Bloomsbury provides world class service, hospitality and cocktails. I was at the Bloomsbury for seven nights and enjoyed the comforts of my room and the availability of quality food at a moments notice. The cocktail bars are the treasures of the Bloomsbury if more time allowed me I would go into more depth about how I love both The Coral room and the Bloomsbury Club.  You can get lost in time and caught up in the amazing atmospheres of these places. I spent a good portion of my evenings in the Bloomsbury Club a classic cocktail lounge with occasional live music and world class cocktails and services. Eduardo the bartender on staff at the bar most evenings provided me with impressive and consistently superb drinks at a amazing value to anyone traveling. The staff here was kind understanding and professional and made my week long stay feel welcomed and appreciated. I recommend anyone to stay at the Bloomsbury for its convenient location to the sights but also its comfortable cozy environment. 

Simply put its a great London hotel with plenty of history and affordable class. It provides fine dining and a amazing cocktail experience. With most of London's key sights a short walk away.",5,2019,08,28
115,Excellent Bloomsbury,"Fantastic service in lovely surroundings!!
Staff extremely service minded. !! 
Great ambience, beutifull Coral Room and outdoor terrace restaurant.
Location is just second to none. Staff reaaly showed their worth, when we had to go to the hospital in the middle of the night !!",5,2019,08,26
115,The delightful Helen and Diego,"I must say, in all my life I would have to say that this has been the most  hospitable hotel experience I’ve ever had. I had the pleasure of being served by the lovely Helen and Diego who recommend the afternoon tea two for one deal. It was so refreshing to see young people with such  zeal for a job. Keep it up Helen and Diego 10s across the board!",5,2019,08,25
115,Wonderful,"Fantastic location, very nice rooms.  Nice little perks like cookies almost every day to the room, excellent coffee machine and teas, juice in the lobby.  We had some issues with hot water in the shower and they sent service very quickly.  Same with an A/C problem.  Lovely bar downstairs and exercise room.",5,2019,08,23
115,"Exceeded expectations, can't wait to return!","I was in London for the first time on a business trip and this hotel was recommended by a coworker who stays there each time she travels to our London office. I did some research before and was intrigued by the beautiful pictures that were on the website and on TripAdvisor and I have to say my expectations were far exceeded when I arrived. I was staying for three nights and arrived before check-in, they happily stored my bag and gave me a call when my room was ready. After a long flight + full day at work and a bit of sightseeing after I was beyond exhausted. Once in my gorgeous room, I had a bit of a tough time figuring out that my key card needed to stay in a slot by the door to keep the lights on, but other than that I was pleasantly surprised by the hospitality. Not only was my room tidy each time I returned I was always met with a welcoming greeting and smile anywhere I went. And the meals...if you can, make sure to add on the breakfast that you can include with your room reservation. I am still dreaming of my breakfast each morning. They also have a beautiful terrace restaurant that has a full wall of beautiful flowers. May be a little pricey for personal travel, but any time I travel for business I will be sure to stay here. Planning to head back to our London office in December and am planning to book here again!",5,2019,08,21
115,Fantastic hotel with amazing settings throughout,I was lucky enough to stay here for the night whilst working in London. I was impressed with everything the hotel had to offer and will be returning for business and pleasure. Ideal setting for a weekend away with your partner in particular.,5,2019,08,20
115,Excellent,I stayed here for three nights in August. Everything was excellent from the moment we arrived. The staff are very attentive and friendly. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. We also had breakfast which was a great continental selection and delicious cooked options. Finally the location is absolutely fantastic close to sites and shopping with a tube station across the road. I would 100% recommend a stay here!,5,2019,08,19
115,Very good hotel,"Not cheap,but not greedily overpriced like many in London.
Very well situated in Central London.
I have two favourite hotels,the Bloomsbury in London,and the Shangri-la in Singapore.Both always recognise me and look after us so well.Of course they have good computer memories.",5,2019,08,19
115,Great value. ,Very comfortable superbly located hotel.  Th staff were extremely helpful.  Excellent breakfast including superb vegetarian options if you go the b&b route.  The breakfast buffet was substantial if not. Rooms are smallish but on London standards that can be easily accepted. Good value for money.  ,5,2019,08,18
115,Our 40th Anniversary Stay at The Bloomsbury,"We came to London from San Francisco.  Our travel agent booked The Bloomsbury for us and it is a fabulous hotel with a great location.  When we arrived we were warmly greeted by the staff.  Our hotel room was beautiful, clean and comfortable.  Any issues we had were promptly addressed by the hotel's staff.  We had breakfast every morning downstairs and the breakfast service was the best.

115,Stylish hotel.,"Friendly helpful staff. Very nice clean comfortable room. Great value. Great location. We were delighted to be given an upgrade which was lovely but a little disappointed the receptionist didn’t explain it included 2 complimentary cocktails in the coral bar. We didn’t find the note mentioning that in our room until the following morning just before we checked out 🥴. Other than that we loved the hotel, very convenient and we’d definitely book it again.",5,2019,08,15

Not far distance, we will definitely revisit The Bloomsbury and highly recommend to others who loved luxurious.",5,2019,08,13
115,"Great hotel, great service and great staff!","Great staff makes every stay at the Bloomsbury memorable. Whether is at reception (Alessia specially), breakfast (Ionut, Maria, Marina), or conference support staff (Ibrahim, the other gentleman with beard whom I cannot remember his name), bar staff, terrace staff (Fabio). The hotel is great and well located but the people is what makes it special. Thank you very much for a great service! I’ll be coming back for either business or pleasure stays again in the future!",5,2019,08,13
115,Bloomsbury Hotel ,"An absolutely wonderful place to stay.

Food and wine out of this world. 
Location is so central to everything, theatre's, Covent Garden and Euston Train Station.
I would highly recommend this hotel and it's staff. ",5,2019,08,11
115,The most exquisite hotel in London!,"We stayed here for two nights after our wedding, and to say the Bloomsbury is phenomenal is an understatement.

The room was the epitome of luxury and the food was absolutely delicious. We ordered the full English and it was the best we've had! The bar downstairs is the perfect place to relax with a vast range of cocktails, beers and wine in a stunning setting. The staff were an absolute delight and tailored to our every need, nothing was too much. 

I would recommend the Bloomsbury to absolutely everybody, it really is the most wonderful hotel in London.",5,2019,08,10
115,Fabulous Stay,"We stayed at The Bloomsbury for the evening of my wife's special birthday.
The staff were excellent,particularly Emanuel.Our room was very comfortable,the Coral Bar impressive and the cooked full English breakfast was one of the best I have ever eaten.! We will be back.",5,2019,08,09
115,Maravillosa estadía,"My mother and I arrived exhausted from a long trip and the first thing we received was the warm reception of his manager Emanuel, who made our stay fantastic. And then, at breakfast Estelita received us, taking care that our breakfasts were more delicious. It is no use a beautiful hotel, without the warmth of its people. The Bloomsbury gathers everything.",5,2019,08,08
115,Nice room and spot,Even thoughthere was some Reno work underway had a nice very quiet room with good amenities. Pleasant staff.   Pretty outdoor bar.best of all great location..easy walk to museum row.restaurants and tube.  A new favourite.,4,2019,08,08
115,Fabulous hotel,I stayed in this hotel with my son. The staff were amazing and so friendly. Each night a glass of milk and cookies were left for my son which was a lovely touch. Beds were very comfy. Coffee machine included in room with plenty of pods and biscuits. Location is great just around corner from Tottenham Court Road tube station. Breakfast was gorgeous and they catered for every taste. Will definitely be back.,5,2019,08,08
115,Excellent Service! Highly Recommend,We stopped at The Bloomsbury as part of a Theatre package deal and cannot speak highly enough of the Staff. A special thanks to Ivan and Than (Guest Relations Manager). We had a few issues due to Superbreak going into administration and the hotel resolved everything really quickly and had total compassion for our situation. Hopefully we will return again soon-Thanks again,5,2019,08,07
115,One night stay before Disneyland Paris trip,We had such an amazing time at this hotel and all the staff made our time so special. Emmanuel in particular was fantastic with the greeting he gave us and the lovely Disney theme gift for my daughter left in our room was a magical touch for her. The dinner we had and the breakfast was also brilliant. Thank you everyone st The Bloomsbury!,5,2019,08,06
115,"Bad start, but overall good","When I arrived I was assigned to room 211 (King Deluxe).  The room was above a construction project.  Also, there was construction outside of the room across the alley with views of garbage piles outside of the windows.  I got hardly any sleep.  

Why even use this room?  Shows poor consideration for guests.  I paid full price for this room, which was completely inadequate.  My room was moved, upon request, however I feel a high quality hotel would never attempt to use this room to begin with.  Especially not at full price.  

Our new room (622) was really great.  They placed us as far away from the construction as possible.  The bed was comfortable and we were able to rest each night.  The concierge was very competent and helped us get transportation to the airport.  The bar downstairs (Coral Room) had fantastic cocktails.  If you plan on visiting the British Museum you can't beat the location.  Literally a 5 minute walk.",4,2019,08,05
115,London hotel Fitzrovia area,"Chose this hotel for it's great location with train station, restaurants, supermarkets, and British Museum. Hotel staff were professional, warm, and friendly, hotel setting was intimate and comfortable amidst the hustle and bustle outside, I liked it had a gym too. Only downside, my room had a small bathroom, but an overflowing shower stall did not add to the experience, despite changing rooms, other shower stall also has a tendency to clog up, hence the average rating specific to my stay.",3,2019,08,04
115,Great Staff and Service,"We recently stayed at the Bloomsbury for a week while visiting London.  Would definitely return - the rooms were lovely - comfy beds and a large bathroom with a heated floor.  The staff was extremely helpful and responsive, especially in helping me locate lost sunglasses.  The Coral Room was gorgeous and a wonderful place to go for a late night drink.  But what was most memorable were the breakfasts each morning - Victor and Ionut took great care of us every day, pampering and entertaining us and then sending us off for a day of touring with go cups of coffee!  Maria and Rosetta were also welcoming and nice to see each day.  Best of luck to them all and hope to return soon!",5,2019,08,02
115,A hidden gem in the heart of London,We had a short stay here due to a night at the theatre in the west end and I wish we had stayed longer. Happy and helpful staff and totally exceeded my expectations. Make sure to have a cocktail in the Coral room and afternoon tea on Dalloway terrace. I would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2019,08,01
115,Fantastic location,"
What a fantastic hotel with great staff. Every need is catered for and they all take pride in there work. Always a smile on their faces and nothing was a problem. 

A great hotel in a fantastic location, amazing breakfast rounded of with homemade cookies at night.

Many thanks to Sebastian for ensuring our trip was enjoyed to the max!

",5,2019,07,31
115,Nice hotel but very basic,"Paying for location for a 4 star hotel. Nice friendly staff and good location, probably need modernising for the price you’re paying to stay overnight.

It’s a short walk from Euston and London St Pancras station, central to everything you need to get to.",3,2019,07,30
115,Wonderful,"What a beautiful hotel, friendly helpful staff, the lounges and The Coral cocktail bar are stunning and the service is excellent.The bedrooms are very comfortable and tastefully furnished.We ate at the Dallaway restaurant the food and service again were excellent.
Although the hotel is tucked away in a peaceful location, it is minutes on foot from the west end shopping and the theatres. We will definitely stay again on our next trip to London.",5,2019,07,30
115,Room was a little small but well appointed and clean. Staff friendly and helpful. Good location near the British Museum,Room was a ittle small but the hotel -- set in a cul de sac -- was lovely although not much of a view from the room window. Breakfast available onsite was good although a bit pricey. Hotel restaurant and bar very nice. Outstanding staff and service.  A very nice place.,5,2019,07,28
115,Great!,"The manager, mr Than helped us a lot. He made us feel like we are still at home even if we are in another country. Mr. Than helped us booking tickets, taking us to the station, and when I get hurt, he was caring us a lot. Even when we are going to another hotel, he also helped us booking the room which has three beds. So me and my family really want to say thank you to Mr.Than.",5,2019,07,28
115,Amazing,"What a lovely gem!! Stunning entrance, very friendly staff, amazing rooms, great cocktail bars and fab location. Would defo go again and again:)
Live music at the club last night was just lush - they were absolutely amazing! Could sit all night just listening to them.",5,2019,07,28
115,HKK73,"A very charming and hospital boutique hotel just slightly off the beaten path.  The staff could not have been friendlier. Breakfast daily was a highlight, and a special thank you to Maria, Victor, Ionut, Estelita & Rosetta who were all attentive and warm.  When my mother fell ill, they insisted on preparing food to take to her.  Everyone was thoughtful and considerate from beginning to end.  We really enjoyed our stay, it was a delight.  Thank you everyone at The Bloomsbury for a wonderful visit to London!",5,2019,07,28
115,Impeccable service as always,"I have stayed here a few times and the service is consistently high. The restaurant team: Maria, Marina, Victor, Estelita, Ionut & Rosetta (and all the wonderful chefs!) make breakfast such a pleasure. It’s like being greeted by your friends, they are all so friendly and make sure you feel looked after and cared for. 

The Check in process is also superb. We were greeted by a charming gentleman as we came out the taxi. He took our suitcase and lead us to reception, where we were also warmly greeted.

The team at the Bloomsbury are incredible. They work extremely hard and do all they can to make every guest feel special and valued. The management team should be very proud for what they have created.",5,2019,07,28
115,Amazing place,"I have been visiting the Bloomsbury for the last 5 years and the people here are AMAZING! Massive thank you to Victor, Maria, Estelita, Ionut, Rosetta and Joel! The team is an amazing family and they even remember my breakfast order! Thank you all!",5,2019,07,28
115,"Ionut, marina and Maria - Bloomsburry club breakfast ❤️",You all look after us so well but all our crew agree you guys go above and beyond. The breakfasts are amazing! .... compliments to the chef! We love the service you provide and all feel looked after so thank you so much.  Can’t wait to visit again!,5,2019,07,28
115,Stunning hotel,"What a pleasure it was to stay at this hotel, the room and facilities were excellent.  The staff were extremely helpful and very friendly the management of the hotel should be very proud of them.  My only regret is that I didn’t book the restaurant as The terrace and food looked so lovely a lesson to be learned when we stay at this fabulous hotel again and which we will certainly recommend to our friends.",5,2019,07,27
115,Storybook Wedding,"From beginning to end, The Bloomsbury was exceptional.The staff, decor, quality, and location were all perfect.  We had an intimate wedding in the Seamus Heaney library and stayed in the hotel with family.  The entire staff went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of for our entire stay,  particularly the wedding.  We had a medical emergency (everything turned out alright) and to a person the hotel staff were incredible.  They made us feel like royalty.  Perfection from beginning to end.",5,2019,07,24
115,Superb family stay at The Bloomsbury,"We took our 10 and 12-year old children to London last week and stayed at The Bloomsbury for four nights. The bottom line is we highly recommend the hotel.  A couple days before we arrived, the hotel concierge was able to obtain tickets to the Harry Potter/Warner Bros. studios for us.  Since it's a popular venue, no tickets were available through normal channels.  This saved dear old procrastinating dad from disappointing the kids. The hotel followed this up by having Harry Potter items waiting for the kids in our room along with milk and cookies on the bedside table.  How is that for a nice welcome?  The room was perfect for us.  The bathroom had two sinks, a shower and separate bathtub, and heated floors. The beds were as good as they get with nearby individual reading lights and several USB ports.  We did a lot of site seeing all day and with the hotel located near the Tottenham tube station, we were able to either walk or subway very easily to the main London attractions (and find suitable dinner spots).  Afterwards, it was always nice to return to our air-conditioned room each evening to find a sweets waiting for us.  Although we slept till 9am each morning, the hotel room was quiet.  We rarely ever heard other guests or employees roaming about.  Each morning we attended the breakfast buffet (included with our reservation) where you could also order hot breakfast items a la carte. The servers were super-attentive and were amazing with the kids.  The pancakes were a real hit.  We wish had more time to experience other aspects of the hotel, including the outside cafe, which was busy each evening, and the first-floor/restaurant. What we did experience, was a very nice luxury hotel with a top-notch staff.",5,2019,07,23
115,Fabulous,"My partner and I had a magnificent stay here. It was our last night in London before flying home and we splurged on this hotel. Pleased to say our money was not wasted! 
We were given a room upgrade and were awarded guest of the day. Bed was so comfortable, decent sized bath, robes, slippers and beautiful touches in the room. Loved the wallpaper! Ivan the concierge booked us a reservation at Patara in SoHo and it was a great meal. Cocktails at the bar downstairs is also a must. 
Thanks for a perfect night.",5,2019,07,23
115,Excellent hotel and stay!,"From the moment we checked in, the staff at The Bloomsbury was exceedingly friendly, helpful, and welcoming.  The hotel is beautifully decorated and in a central location in London.  The rooms are well-equipped with complimentary bottled water, Nespresso machines, delicious cookies, and bathroom amenities.  The hotel also does a turn down service in the evening, where they place water and chocolates by the bed.  This elevated our experience even more.  We stayed at the hotel for five nights  on our honeymoon and on our last night, Than Min, the guest relations manager, went above and beyond to make our stay extremely special.  We highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2019,07,20
115,Bloomsbury - Great For Families Too!,"We booked two rooms here for 5 nights. It was fantastic! Loved the rooms, hotel was clean and the breakfast was great. No complaints!

115,Tip-top stay for long weekend,"Excellent location, a relaxing haven at the heart of the bustling city. Room was very smart, a good size and nice and quiet, while breakfast was top notch, with a wide variety to choose from over a three-night stay. Coral Room bar is swanky too and mixed up a mean whisky sour.
Pricey, but that's London. Would definitely return.",5,2019,07,18
115,Just magnificent ,"From the moment we arrived we were looked after by Mr Neve the general manager, who was kind enough to carry our bags to our room , which was a fantastic suite  on the fourth floor. We will then treated to a succulent and beautifully presented meal in the evening, and very reasonable cost, which would be hard to be bettered. Hotel position is ideal for shopping, recreation, sightseeing, and if you’re visiting a sporting event. Don’t look too much further, you will be hard pressed to find better",5,2019,07,17
115,Lovely boutique hotel,"Lovely boutique hotel centrally located a few blocks from the British Museum and West End theaters. It’s expensive, but it’s also London. We had a family room with two beds. No view but very well appointed. High end bathroom. Nice touches like scones or cookies in our room each day, along with small welcome gifts for our kids. Excellent breakfasts. Attentive service. ",5,2019,07,17
115,Beautiful hotel and attentive service,"My partner booked this hotel for our stay a few weeks ago and it is beautiful but the highlight was there service.

Highly reccomend this hotel.",5,2019,07,13
115,A perfect spot in London,"I travel to London a couple of times of year for work, The Bloomsbury will not be my go to hotel. The rooms are lovely and staff is friendly and attentive. The food is delicious and decently priced for London and the patio is perfect for brunch and/or cocktails.",5,2019,07,08
115,Great ,"We only stayed one night when seeing Harry Potter and The Cursed Child’. We throughly enjoyed it. We were upgraded and allowed into our room at 11.15! The room was small but perfect for one night. Well laid out bathroom with white fluffy towels. A most comfortable bed with crisp white bedding. 
We didn’t spend a lot of time downstairs however, it seemed full of inviting places to sit and, of course, the Coral room.
Will be staying again! ",5,2019,07,07
115,Excellent hotel and ideal location,"We recently stayed at The Bloomsbury hotel during a visit to London to see the Gloria Estafan musical.
The hotel was in a ideal location for the theatre, Oxford Street and the British Museum all within walking distance. The hotel rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel  provides a relaxed atmosphere in comfortable surroundings and I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good hotel in this location.",5,2019,07,04
115,Very Posh!!,"Awesome hotel!!  The bar, the rooms, the food and mainly the staff, just awesome.  Had a great stay.  Every morning breakfast with Vicior and Ionut, they got our morning started just right.  In the evening Gabriel at the Coral Room took care of us like we were royalty!!

I would come back here in a heart beat!!",5,2019,07,04
115,Great theater and museum location,"We had a great 10-day stay at this lovely hotel. The manager and staff were attentive and helpful with all of our needs. The room was clean and comfortable. Meals at the Dalloway Terrace were excellent as well as convenient. The Coral Room is a beautiful bar and the drink selection is wild -- try the Apple & Pear. The hotel is conveniently located to theaters, the National Gallery, the British Museum, and multiple tube stations.",5,2019,07,03
115,Second home,"I spend almost half of my time in London and always stay at the Bloomsbury.  The team are fun, friendly and professional.  The rooms are beautiful and equipped with everything you need.  I especially love the breakfast and the team downstairs (big thanks to Marina and Victor for my surprise birthday cake and bottle of wine!).  Honestly, a very special place.",5,2019,07,01
115,Excellent Hotel perfectly located,"The Bloomsbury provided what every business person needs when in London; perfectly located it has an easy access to the tube station and is a walk away from Holborn and Oxford Street. The staff has been helpful and the rooms are clean, tidy and provide perfect bedding for a good night sleep especially after a long day of work. The Dalloway Terrace provided the perfect spot for breakfast, lunch and dinner as it is cosily situated adjacent to the hotel. The price for a room is on the high side and this is something that you need to bear in mind when deciding on booking at this hotel. ",5,2019,07,01
115,false charges on my bill,"They charged me for a room service breakfast that I neither ordered or received. When i brought this to their attention at checkout when I reviewed the bill, they assured me it would be taken off. They have never refunded my card. This was weeks ago.",3,2019,06,28
115,"Beautiful hotel, amazing service and attentive staff","We loved The Bloomsbury, the hotel is stunning and in a great location.  The staff were attentive and nothing was too much trouble.  The breakfast was fantastic and great value for money.  Special extra touches for our anniversary was a great touch.  We did have a couple of minor issues with our particular room but the excellent customer service once this was pointed out was fantastic.  Thank you Bloomsbury team we will be back.",5,2019,06,28
115,Wonderful hotel and attentive staff,"The hotel is situated in a wonderful location and is beautifully decorated throughout. The staff were so attentive and made us feel very welcome, even ensuring my partner had a wonderful birthday! The bars are the best around serving amazing cocktails in a beautiful setting. Would highly recommend!",5,2019,06,28
115,Great location,"This is a lovely hotel in a central location. Good service. I actually love a hotel in London where you can open a window which was a big plus for me. The only negative was we were at the back of the hotel above the kitchen so sometimes it did smell of cooking. 
The bar was amazing but quite expensive. There is a bar in all one just round the back so if you’re on a bit more of a budget just op in there. 
All in all great hotel",4,2019,06,28
115,FANTASTIC HOTEL,"Ms Melinda in The Coral Room was very kind, very helpful, and a credit to the hotel.
All the staff were amazing - but Melinda was very special

I am in a wheelchair  - so people being kind to me is important",5,2019,06,27
115,"Welcoming Staff, Beautiful Hotel, would 100% recommend","Amazing experience. Hotel staff went above and beyond to accommodate us. We were able to check in at 10, despite check in being at 3PM, after a long flight. And, they even upgraded us from 
a small ""cozy"" room to a suite! They were friendly, knowledgeable, and welcoming.The rooms were nice as well, some parts could use some new paint and updates, but the bathroom was spotless, and the bed was so comfortable. The tea, espresso and biscuits were a really nice touch.  The Dalloway Terrace was perfect for tea, and they were able to accommodate my gluten allergy. We loved visiting the Bloomsbury Club bar for light snacks and drinks. Great music, friendly staff. The interior and exterior decor of the hotel is second to none, and very ""instagrammable."" Overall, would definitely recommend The Bloomsbury if you are looking for a hotel with great amenities, a great location in central London, and extra special staff. 

We will definitely be back!",5,2019,06,25
115,"Great Ambiance, Location and Service A+ London Experience","I try to stay in a different section of London each time I visit to get a good feel of the city. My Bloomsbury experience has been one of the best thus far. I highly recomend it as a hotel, restaurant, and location. I walked to the majority of my sights. Service was top notch. Would stay again in a heartbeat. Note, I am a female and traveled solo. This area was exceptionally comfortable and safe. ",5,2019,06,24
115,Memorable anniversary weekend,"We celebrated our wedding anniversary at The Bloomsbury and we will definitely be back again.  The Guest Relations Manager, Than Min, ensured we had all that we needed from check in to departure.  We stayed in the Luxury Studio Suite and were very impressed with the tastefully decorated spacious corner suite that had all the luxuries a traveller could need (including a Dyson hairdryer).  The bathroom was the main highlight, generously spacious with a stunning freestanding roll top bath.  Without a doubt, this has been the nicest bathroom out of all the hotel suites we've stayed in!  We tried all the hotel bars / restaurants and the service was excellent at each one.  The coral room salon bar is worth a visit, we couldn't help feeling this is what London in the 1020's must have been like.  Than suggested we pop into the Bloomsbury Club Bar after our show and it was the perfect way to end a wonderful weekend.  With live music playing, amazing cocktails (I'll be back for another Dora Carrington) and attentive bar staff.",5,2019,06,24
115,SImply perfect,From arrival to departure the experience in the Bloomsbury Hotel is wonderful. Attentive staff and the hotel's location makes this property a must stay location when in London. I look forward to my next stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel.,5,2019,06,24
115,Perfect,"We always stay here. It's in a central location, around the corner from Oxford St Shopping, a short walk to Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square and many more. The staff are friendly, professional and welcoming. It's lovely when you're welcomed back by the doorman. The rooms are clean and the decor is calming. The windows open so you don't need the heating on all the time. You will sink in to the dreamy beds. The Dalloway Terrace restaurant is a must, the food is delicious and it feels like you're sitting in and English conservatory. TIP: Request an outside room otherwise you overlook an internal atrium which can be a little dark.",5,2019,06,24
115,"Excellent Hotel, staff were brilliant!!","Stayed at The Bloomsbury for an evening whilst in London for a concert. The staff are a real credit to this hotel nothing is too much trouble.  
Great end to the evening in The Coral Bar for cocktails, with brilliant staff on hand.  The dining area for breakfast was great also with very attentive staff and high quality food.
The hotel also in a great location for Covent Garden, Soho and the Theaters, very short walk (less than 5 minutes) from Tottenham Court Road station for easy travelling connections.
Highly recommended, looking forward to a return!!",5,2019,06,24
115,In love with this hotel. Definitely will recommend it,"It was amazing time staying with Bloomsbury hotel The staff was amazing. Special thanks we would like to say to Emanuel ( desc supervisor) and Than , they’ve been so professional and nice. Definitely well come back again",5,2019,06,23
115,Lovely stay and lovely staff,"The stay was smooth and comfortable, The concierge team was great with pointing us to the nicest spots in London.
Special thanks to all the staff members for their assistance and specially Than who was attentive and made sure our stay was extra special.",5,2019,06,22
115,"Perfect Location, Perfect Stay",Had a lovely long weekend in London with the husband and this was the perfect spot. Many shops and eateries nearby. Easy access to the Tottenham Rd Tube station. On site restaurant and bar were wonderful. Staff was very accommodating.  Room was just right and QUIET. Would stay again in a heartbeat.,5,2019,06,21
115,Stay Here,"I cannot say enough about the entire Bloomsbury experience! We stayed in the family room and it was perfect. Plenty of room and all of the amenities you would need. The Dalloway Restaurant and the bar were both the type of place you would visit even if you are not staying at the hotel. In fact, it seemed like a good mix of travelers and locals. The entire staff was very nice and helpful. You know how you can tell when people enjoy where they work? Plus, we thought it was the perfect location. It's about a 10-15 minute walk to SoHo and Mayfair and only a 30 minute walk from the Westminster Abbey/London Eye/Buckingham Palace/10 Downing area and about the same to Kensington/Harrods. But the hotel is kind of tucked away, so it's really quiet. 100% if would stay here again!",5,2019,06,20
115,Vibrant Oasis in a busy city!,"Stayed here for 6 nights.  Attentive staff and very nice.  Lovely room on the 5th floor.  Nicely updated room and bathroom.  Bathroom a bit small but not unusual for the city.  They have several bars on the property so you can change it up every night to relax and end the day.  Very close to a tube station as we took that everyday to get around and see the city.  Plenty of other restaurants, coffee, etc. nearby.  Walked to the British Museum close by.  The Dalloway Terrace restaurant on site was very good and great atmosphere.  Will definitely stay here again as the location is in a nice area, with easy access to tube.",5,2019,06,18
115,Great location and helpful staff,"I stayed with a friend for two nights and I couldn't fault the hotel. The staff were accomodating and always had a smile on their face. When it was raining, the staff would offer umbrellas as we were leaving the hotel, a very nice touch. The room was adequate in size although the bed was quite small. We couldn't hear any noise from our room considering we were just off Tottenham Court Road. I would love to visit again.",5,2019,06,18
115,Lovely hotel in a fantastic location,"This was our first time staying at The Bloomsbury, and we picked it primarily because of the location. As the name implies, it's tucked in Bloomsbury - just down the street from the British Museum. It's a manageable walk or quick tube ride to most of the major sights in Central London. While we chose the hotel for its location, we ultimately ended up loving everything about it. The service was fantastic, rooms were clean, air conditioning was top notch (a big plus in the summer), and the restaurant in-house was solid. Bedding was very comfortable, for those who are light sleepers. The Bloomsbury will definitely be at the top of our list if and when we return to London.",5,2019,06,17
115,"Excellent Hotel, Wonderful & Friendly Staff, Best Breakfast!","Our family of 4 was welcomed warmly off of the overnight flight from the U.S.  The rooms were well appointed, quiet, great showers and awesome Espresso machines.  

Perhaps the best part of the hotel was the English Breakfast.  We stayed in London, Florence and Rome on this trip and The Bloomsbury Hotel breakfast was hands down the best.  Food was perfect and the service by Marina and Estelita was a perfect 10.  

For those who have allergies - the staff is extremely accommodating.",5,2019,06,15
115,A gem in the West End,"A truly lovely hotel in a very central location. Excellent staff and two pretty good bars as well.
We had tickets for the opening night of Bitter Wheat and even though we live in Brighton we thought we'd treat ourselves to a night in town and The Bloomsbury was a fantastic treat.",5,2019,06,14
115,An outstanding hotel,We stayed at The Bloomsbury as a weekend break coupled with attending a close friend’s birthday. From our arrival through to departure we were looked after so well by all whom we met. Outstanding  food and accommodation.,5,2019,06,13
115,"Excellent Place, Vibe, and Service","I stayed at the Bloomsbury with my family only for a short period of time but the general vibe and the location of the hotel really becomes the major contributing factor for wishing to stay for more. Gorgeous decoration, great facilities, very helpful and warm staff members! Specifically, Than Min, the guest relations manager, was very kind, helpful, and patient to make sure that we have a very pleasant experience overall. This was quiet exceptional for me especially when I personally experienced that managers give more attention to the guests staying for a longer time. True professional. 
Great luxury experience for a relatively sensible value!
Highly recommend!",5,2019,06,13
115,Great Breakfast thanks to Estelita & Marina,Estelita & Marina were the perfect hosts every morning during my two week stay. They were warm and inviting and lovely. By far they made my stay at the hotel worthwhile. The variety of breakfast food was delicious.,5,2019,06,13
115,A luxury home away from home,"Having stayed in a bunch of hotels around central London, I always end up coming back to the Blooms. Cosy, chic, comfortable and glam - having a cuppa with a biccie in a sumptuous Bloomsbury robe, propped up on the best squishy 1000-thread-count pillows is the best way to end an intense London day!",5,2019,06,12
115,Gorgeous hotel,"Stayed for 2 weekend nights as a group of  four friends, we all said it was a beautiful hotel , it’s welcoming from the outside and once inside it’s a hotel full of colour and fabulous rooms, all the different areas are a delight to be in. It’s a really great sized boutique hotel and would definitely stay again!",5,2019,06,11
115,Perfect service ,"We had a bottle of wine and a few nibbles. Eduardo was taking care of us, thank you so much for a great vibe and he was very knowledge. Keep it up guys. For sure we will come back. Highly recommended place to visit.",5,2019,06,10
115,Disgrace to be let down by customer service,"In this class of hotel you expect a high level of customer service, however, we did not experience this. Some staff members were just rude, others just couldn't understand English. The bar service was so slow, it took over half an hour to get my first drink. The front desk tried to make up for our experience by cancelling our bar bill, which was very generous, but then they tried to charge us on our credit card a few days later after we left! 

It's such a shame to be let down by customer service especially when the ambience, decor, cleanliness, room service are all exceptionally good. 
",3,2019,06,10
115,Bloomin’ marvellous with staff to match,"I called into book afternoon tea & to ask about disababled access at the beautiful Dalloway Terrace. The staff were very helpful and confirmed there would be no problem & explained where we could sit with ease & showed me the disabled lift too.
We then went for a drink in the the Coral Room a manager came straight over and spoke to us, he checked we were being served and brought us some nuts & olives to go with our drinks. We are planning a short stay in the hotel in the future & spoke to the reception staff who were helpful. The customer relations manager overheard & went to the trouble to explain the different levels of rooms & which ones had walk in showers. Whilst there we also popped down to see the Club Bar where we were welcomed by the hotel manager who chatted with us and showed us were the band would be playing later that night.  I cannot think of a more helpful & friendy team. I very much look forward to afternoon tea this month & our stay later this year.",5,2019,06,09
115,Pleasure,"This is the second time we have stayed here,  just a brilliant hotel in a great location with fantastic service.  The rooms are tastefully decorated and the restaurant and bar are excellent..,
Can’t fault it,  this time we were made guest of the day so had a free upgrade and a cocktail in the coral bar....
Can’t say enough good things about it...",5,2019,06,08
115,Excellent hotel!,"The Bloomsbury is a fantastic hotel! The staff was incredibly helpful. The room was nicely furnished with nice amenities. Best of all, the hotel's location put us within walking distance to much of central London. Easy access to the Underground, Oxford street, and so much more!",5,2019,06,07
115,Great spot!,"We spent the first few days of our honeymoon at the hotel.  Very friendly staff, helpful concierge, close to hop on hop off bus routes and many quality restaurants.  Delicious breakfast every morning, more than generous. We loved it!",5,2019,06,06
115,Always exceeds expectations,"I stay at the Bloomsbury several times per year for more than a week each time for business, so have a lot of breadth on which to base my review. It is the same every time- I am very happy when I stay at the hotel, and grateful for how much it adds to the quality of my life! It is aesthetically  lovely and constantly upgraded. The staff are kind people, and top notch hospitality professionals. I am able to use the hotel efficiently for work, entertaining clients and friends, and relaxing.  ",5,2019,06,05
115,Minimooners ,My wife and I stayed here for two nights and we loved it! The hotel is exceptionally clean and modern. A lovely friendly and welcoming bar and restaurant with a lovely menu. We caught a show and the hotel is perfect for this. The staff are very helpful and professional. We would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone. Only let down and to be expected in the city is the car parking.... the nearest one is a fair walk.,5,2019,06,05
115,London Hotel,"My wife and I were very pleased with the Bloomsbury Hotel for our stay in London. Its location was excellent, the service was outstanding and the facility was marvelous. It more than met our expectations and I would highly recommend the Bloomsbury.",5,2019,06,04
115,very nice hotel,"we stayed at this hotel for a long weekend on may 2019
this is a very nice hotel great location in the center but quiet 
the rooma are very confortable the brackfast is excellent and all the staff is great",5,2019,06,03
115,Amazing experience at The Bloomsbury hotel.,"I had an amazing experience at The Bloomsbury hotel.
This is a beautiful boutique hotel with a great location in London's best area!
We received the highest level of service.
The small and thoughtful details made our stay unique and pleasant.
The hotel has a really good restaurant and bar with good atmosphere and delicious food!
I’d like to compliment the hotel staff personally : Naomi, Renske, Sebastian and Eliasa

No doubt I’ll be back here for my next vacation in London",5,2019,06,02
115,Frequent Guest,"I have stayed at the Bloomsbury several times over the last few years and have to say the experience gets better and better. 

Over the many stays i have experienced all the hotel offers - the cleanliness of the entire place, the welcoming and nothing is too much service from staff, the sophisticated and elegant bars and restaurants, the quality of the food in the restaurants or room service.  It all hangs together perfectly and everything just works. 

The place oozes sophistication and a classy ambience and is without a doubt one of the best hotels in London.",5,2019,05,31
115,My hotel of choice for both business and pleasure!,"I have stayed at the Bloomsbury several times and keep coming back because...
- the location is ideal for me (well connected to/from Heathrow and the City, excellent tube/bus connections everywhere, wonderful book and guitar shops and the West End theatres just around the corner);
- the rooms I’ve stayed at have always been clean and peaceful;
- the reception has always been warm and welcoming. 

Obviously, I can only speak for myself but if it’s up to me the Bloomsbury will be my choice for my next visit to London, as well.",5,2019,05,31
115,A memorable stay for my birthday ,"My husband and I had the chance to spend 3 nights at The Bloomsbury hotel for a special occasion. As soon as we arrived we felt instantly at home thanks to a warm welcome from the team. They had prepared some very special amenities in our beautiful Suite, all personalized like if they knew us already. 
You can see that every detail matters to them! 
We also visited their bar and restaurant one of the evening which was an amazing experience.
A special thanks to Camille who really made our stay so special ! 
We’ll be back, for sure !",5,2019,05,30
115,Highlight of our London Trip!,"Amazing stay at the Bloomsbury!  Beautiful hotel, walking distance to most London's great attractions.  Great bars and restaurants with amazing service.  Booked a deluxe room for our anniversary (we were assigned a corner room, bright and airy as I requested).  The room was a good size and beautifully decorated.  Bathroom was a little small compared to other hotels we stayed during our trip, but it was functional.   Great value for $$.  Nothing to envy the other very ""exclusive"" hotels in the area.  I will definitely stay again and recommend to all my friends!!",5,2019,05,29
115,Impeccably beautiful hotel in a great location,"I come to London every few months for work and always stay at the Bloomsbury.  The hotel is beautiful inside and out, the staff are amazing, the bars and restaurants are top notch.   Be sure to have breakfast on the Dalloway Terrace at least once during your stay, and a cocktail in the Coral Room.",5,2019,05,29
115,Great property with fantastic public areas,"Great stay!  The public areas--especially the Coral Room are wonderful and varied and provide a space for any guest to enjoy the property and the area. The rooms are fairly straight forward but have comfortable beds and high quality linens, which is the most important in my book. We had a bit of an issue with our room when we first checked in--despite booking a Deluxe size room with the beds split, the room was still pretty small and not a lot of space between the beds.  Than (shift manager) and his team were very helpful in getting my friend and I into two separate rooms. 

Regardless, you'll spend more time in the bars/sitting areas than in your room if you do this hotel right!",5,2019,05,29
115,Bloomsbury Hotel is out of this world,"Now i have stayed in some pretty swanky hotel rooms but this one takes the cake. The suites ( worth while being upgraded for free  ) or pay the extra . My suite was huge and although it didnt have a great view , it was nicely appointed with all the mod cons and amenities you would expect from a 5 star hotel . The location is also a bonus , short walk to some of the best shopping around. The Coral Room ( Bar ) was a great spot for a drink or a bite to eat . Would certainly stay here again !!!",5,2019,05,29
115,Perfect in every way! ,"We travelled with two young children for a long weekend and stayed in this gem of a place in central London. The building itself is beautiful from outside and in. The decor is inviting, on the terrace, the fabulous bars or the living room.  We had connecting rooms which worked perfectly with the two little ones, who were well cared for one of the nights by the Hotels babysitter Eileen. Big shout out to Brian, head concierge who entertained the kids and gave us great guidance around the city. 
Breakfast was very good with a wide variety to choose from, lunch on the terrace was delicious. The rooms were serviced well, especially when the kids toys all over the place. The kids especially loved the cookies and milk. 
I couldn’t fault this place, perfect for a family visit, a business trip, a girls weekend away, it suits all types. Thanks for being so welcoming and we look forward to our next trip. ",5,2019,05,28
115,Wedding anniversary at the Bloomsbury,"This year I surprised my wife with a return to The Bloomsbury (where we stayed on our wedding night) for a few days in London to visit a few sights and catch a show. The Bloomsbury is a great hotel and delivers a top notch service. Rooms are a good size, very well presented and clean. The eggs benedict at breakfast are the best ever!",4,2019,05,28
115,Great first time stay,"What a great hotel. From the moment we walked up and we’re greeted by someone who promptly took our bag and led us to reception we weren’t disappointed with our choice. 
We were given a room upgrade and also 2 free cocktails which was much appreciated. 
We took advantage of the 24 hour room service and after returning from seeing a show and having a few drinks, felt a bit peckish. The burger went down very well!
Breakfast was also excellent, although the eggs could be better quality - a bit tasteless, but can not grumble about anything else really. ",5,2019,05,27
115,Make Your London Stay Colored by Bloomsbury!,"My husband and I stayed at the Bloomsbury for 3 nights and it was an amazing experience. It is a historic building with a stunning interior with rich colors and pretty furniture, artworks and design. Their cocktails are signature and so tasty and the food is amazing British cuisine. The rooms have so much character and they're clean. It is located steps away from the Totenham Court underground station, British Museum, and Oxford Street. It is a super lively place, so happening at nights, and has great live music from Thursday to Sunday every night. Their staff are very helpful, professional and so accommodating. You'll have an unforgettable experience  at the iconic Bloomsbury Hotel!",5,2019,05,27
115,Easy Transition,I was recommended to stay at this hotel in London for a business trip. I had not been in London for 25 years. The hotel had AMERICAN plug options and a super nice restaurant and bar area with lots of character. It was conveniently located to walk to the office as well as London sites and the theater district. The staff was helpful and friendly. The rooms were very nice and updated but still had London character.  The area around the hotel felt safe. ,5,2019,05,27
115,Great service!,"This hotel has better service than 95 star hotels I’ve stayed at. My sister and I were here celebrating her birthday and we found the staff to be amazingly helpful and accommodating. They truly bent over backwards to be of service. Del, one concierge, Walk to my sister and I to a restaurant for dinner so we wouldn’t get lost. Maggie one of the waitresses in the downstairs bar area provided us with omelettes and grilled cheese sandwiches, even though they were not on the menu, because we were too tired to go out after a long day of touring. The rooms are not large but spec and span always with with clean towels and linens by the time we come back from our day.  I cannot begin to tell you how impressed I have been with the staff. Service is A plus and I would recommend this cute boutique hotel to anyone!",4,2019,05,26
115,Just wonderful in every way!,"Actually booked this hotel due to the funky decor, but it is so much more. Room was small but had everything and a beautiful marble bathroom. Bed v comfortable with white cotton sheets with feather duvet. Staff are all attentive and really make sure you are happy. The singer in the bar was amazing. Just walking up to the hotel gave a sense of class with plants either side of the steps.
Oh yes good to see a real plant in the bathroom 😉.
We will be back. ",5,2019,05,26
115,Fantastic Service ,"First time at this hotel fabulous service! From the front desk to the restaurants to room service! Dell the concierge was wonderful to my sister and I! Maggie and the manager in  the café bar were fantastic and made us food that was not on the menu! It was my birthday and I was greeted with a bottle of champagne on ice which was quite lovely!  Whatever I asked for from room service was delivered quickly and with a smile on the person’s face! The breakfast staff was extremely friendly and also catered  to whatever we needed!
It is A boutique hotel and I would stay at again if I ever returned to London! Recommended very highly !",5,2019,05,26

115,Top notch service in a prime location ,"Well it’s only the third night we’re here but the prior recommendations didn’t fail to reflect the truth as usual. Indeed it Is located on an area which is in my thoughts and opinion the most central for visiting London.
This means your steps away from Oxford Street the West End Seven dials call Tottenham Court tube station Covent Garden British museum  and many others like SoHo
Rooms are very nice decorated in  a classic way . I won’t say it’s premium on DeCora but the service is for a certain premium at the bar at the dining room during the perfect breakfast tables housekeeping Concierge and front desk all areSuper helpful & will do their best to make your life easier while staying with them and more enjoyable what a lovely choice while in London ",5,2019,05,25
115,Superb as usual.,"This is a ’5 star’ establishment. The rooms are lovely. The staff are efficient and gracious. The situation is perfect for the west end and all it offers.
Cocktails are knockout and the downstairs, after hours bar/club is awesome.",5,2019,05,22
115,Surprisingly good hotel,"Despite 45 years working/living/staying im London, I'd never heard of this place. Very glad I now have.  In an unfashionable backwater but, to be fair, very convenient location for all of the city centre, this place has not long been totally refurbished. They've done it well. Welcoming staff, nice redesigns, good public spaces....it's not cheap - but it's good value. ",4,2019,05,19
115,Comfortably perfect .,"I could have time very comfortably.
I was impressed by the amenity goods of  excellent aromatherapy associates . Also in the evening , the staff came to ask me whether I had  any problem and  was something else I need.
I'd like to say  thank all of gentle staffs.",5,2019,05,18
115,Wonderful Bloomsbury ,"Brian Murphy was my first initial point of contact and assisted me via email with dinner reservations, and what to do in the neighborhood. He took a lot of stress out of my travel. Estelita and Marina were simply a delight! Such a warm welcome in the restaurant for breakfast. When i didn’t come down one day, they kindly sent breakfast treats to my room and sent an wedding anniversary dessert. Marina and Estelita made me feel at home. The entire staff is an extended family. We had drinks in Bloomsbury Club and the live jazz band was a hit. It was so refreshing to be in a dim, engaging atmosphere. We can’t wait to go back.",5,2019,05,17
115,2 night stay in London,"The Bloomsbury is a very comfortable Hotel to stay, very quiet and the Hotel staff attentive.
We only had 1 breakfast, the buffet was amazing with lots of choice. The Hotel was really a base for our weekend as we had other plans for eating and drinking.",4,2019,05,16
115,Perfectly perfect,"My stay in the Bloomsbury was amazing, the central location, the very cozy atmosphere but specially the staff who goes above and beyond to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. A special thank you to Cyrielle and Than for their help and attention!",5,2019,05,14
115,Chic and Comfortable,"Stayed for a business event so I cannot claim to have made the choice, but that notwithstanding this is a very good hotel with excellent facilities. The meeting room was OK if a bit cramped for 22 of us and the lunchtime food was fine, but once again the choice was a bit small for a coeliac sufferer. One day I will stay here on leisure and really experience the hotel.",4,2019,05,13
115,Lovely :),"We picked this hotel by recommendation and it was a great choice. The location is perfect if you want to visit the main tourist areas in London, but as it is not in a main Street, the hotel is quiet and well isolated from noise.
The decoration is delightful both in common areas and rooms, full of details and of course, very comfy.
The best: staff service and breakfast (probably the best breakfast I ever had in a hotel).
The worst (to say something bad): too many corridors (I got lost a couple of times when getting back to my room 😅)",5,2019,05,12
115,Another excellent visit,"This hotel is becoming a firm favourite when we visit London.  It is excellently situated for the West End and Oxford Street etc.  The rooms are well appointed, although, a few more three pin sockets wouldn't go amiss.

The breakfast is made to order with pastries etc available buffet style. 

Staff are helpful and reasonable room prices is an added bonus.",5,2019,05,12
115,Lovely hotel,"From walking in to leaving it was lovely, friendly staff, clean hotel, superb rooms with a large comfy bed. The food was superb . The best we’ve stayed in so far. We stayed one night as we were going to the theatre which we went to in a taxi but walked back, it was close to Covent Garden too, in fact we walked everywhere, British museum was around the next street.",5,2019,05,12
115,Great Choice of Hotel,"Just waking up on a sunny Sunday morning in The Bloomsbury Hotel.  This is a great place to stay when visiting our Capital city.  Hannah in Reception was exceptionally helpful when our booking agent, Amoma had not completed the booking or passed on our pre-payment. My only note of caution for this excellent hotel, is that the drinks prices are unnecessarily expensive.  A walk to a nearby pub will get you the same G & T for half the price.",5,2019,05,12
115,The best 4-star experience in central London,"We stayed in other very good hotels in this area, including 5-star, but this hotel exceeded our expectations. It provides an experience rather than just a room. It has a beautiful décor in the rooms, the restaurant and bar, and in the sitting room with a live fireplace on the ground floor. Our room was very quiet, had beautiful furniture, a nice Nespresso machine, a very comfortable bed, and it was very clean. On arrival we received delicious desserts from the restaurant as a welcome gesture. The staff was very efficient. When we ran out of coffee capsules, and let the reception know, they were delivered to our room in less than 5 minutes. Overall, a great experience, home away from home with a touch of luxury.",5,2019,05,11
115,Wonderful Hotel,"If you want live very comfortably with a touch of luxury and a great location to all the is great about London please come stay at this hotel. The staff are attentive and helpful, the rooms are smartly designed clean and stylish, and the bars, the dining areas are wonderfully put together.  The best stay in London thus far. An absolute must for a return in the future!",5,2019,05,11
115,Gem of a hotel,"Lovely friendly hotel in walking distance of many places of interest. Staff were professional without being snooty. Room a bit on the small side but that's normal for London. The room had plenty of drawers and clothes space something often missing in small rooms. 
",5,2019,05,11
115,Staff excellence at its best,From the minute we stepped out of the taxi at The Bloomsbury our every need was anticipated and catered for.  The staff were all excellent everywhere in the hotel.  We received a great welcome and shown to our room which was immaculate and had everything we needed and more.  The food looked and tasted beautiful and would definitely recommend using the restaurant.  I am looking forward to staying here again. ,5,2019,05,08
115,"Excellent room, location and service","Excellent hotel. Brilliant location--very near the British Museum, many restaurants within walking distance, very close to Tottenham Court and Leicester Square tube stations. Luxurious room and bath, clean and comfortable. Sitting room is like relaxing in your own living room (but with much fancier furnishings.) The restaurant and bar in the hotel are lovely and the service throughout is extraordinary--always friendly and accomodating. Can't wait to go back!",5,2019,05,08
115,Stay in Central London,"Excellent Location, very convenient, Fresh and Modern. Ideal for a short stay in London, close to Oxford Street and right next to the metro station. Breakfast offers a good selection of healthy items. Highly recommended. ",5,2019,05,08
115,"Excellent hotel, excellent staff, excellent location","My trip to London was a joyful experience thanks to my stay at this hotel. The hotel is in the centre of London and meant it was easy for us to get around and experience the buzz of the city, but still felt like we were in a different world once we walked back through the doors of the hotel. It is so beautifully designed with an open fire waiting for you once you walk in off the busy streets of London.  

From arriving at the hotel, the service could not have been better. The staff were very welcoming, helpful and went above and beyond. The bedroom & bathroom were spacious and clean. The beds were very comfy and there were good facilities in the room, including a nespresso machine. 

There was an extensive breakfast menu to choose from every morning and a continental buffet. We were a group of 5 (in 2 rooms) and they were always able to sit us together without issue. The food was delicious and even when we were being ""awkward"" asking for variations to the menu the staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble. I would also recommend the Dolloway Terrace for brunch, it was divine. It is a beautiful space and such a unique setting. The coral room is perfect for cocktails before hitting the town. 

Overall it was the perfect location for a long overdue catch-up with the girls. I'll definitely be back again to visit.",5,2019,05,07
115,Wonderful hotel and staff!,"We stayed here before continuing onto our cruise. We received exceptional service from the moment we drove up the driveway.
Shout out to Ruby and Marieke our excellent dining staff, Abudi for all his care in getting out suitcases to our rooms and meeting our check-in needs and to Riccardo making sure we found our misplaced credit card.
Check in staff, when they found out we needed a room more accessible for handicap, was right on it.
Highly recommend this hotel. It is a little bit more expensive but well worth it.",5,2019,05,06
115,Beautiful interior with super friendly staff and a cosy lit fire to welcome us.,"Our trip to London was a very relaxing one thanks to the chilled vibe and lovely staff  we were met with in  The Bloomsbury. I think its a signature of the Irish Doyle Collection hotels, their friendly smiling and helpful staff and it stands out. Lets face it thats what you need after a hard days shopping in nearby Oxford street when your feet are ready to give up!
There is a beautifully designed front room just in off the entrance that lures you with its beautiful peackock blue and green Arts and crafts wallpaper and the velvet couches and open fire which is permanently on say curl up here now and have an Irish coffee ( which I did). They have an English wine menu too which looks very interesting next time maybe! There was a jar of macaroons perfectly positioned to entice us into sampling some.
The room was spacious enough and the bathroom too and I must confess that their shower samples and body cream were heaven to smell.
Breakfast had very attentive staff looking after our every need and a good menu with all types of eggs available and of course healthy Irish porridge with a twist( cacoa nibs and crushed berries) A plentiful buffet of salads fruits and pastries and all the healthy stuff nuts berries etc were there too.
The bar is beautifully designed and definitely a cool to be seen place to meet friends for cocktails, but we had packed so much in on our quick visit we were happy to chill at the fire
Overall we found it very restful with a happy positive vibe.",5,2019,05,06
115,"From now on, my go-to hotel in London","I have been travelling London for two decades, usually staying as central as possible, within walking distance of the city heart. Usually the hotels that match my criteria are nice, but offer tiny rooms. Not with the Bloomsbury. Spacious rooms (we were 3 parties during this trip), all very nice looking, comfortable, and very quite. We couldn't hear any of the usual city noise in the morning, which was nice. And, I would like to commend the incredible hotel staff. Welcoming, friendly, competent, everyone went out of their way to make sure we experience a world class customer service. This is why the Bloomsbury is going to be out go-to hotel from now on, whenever we visit London.",5,2019,05,06
115,A hotel with outstanding services,"The staff is very helpful and very kind, the room I stayed was spacious and comfortable. The room service was excellent! On the top of that the breakfast is amazing. I stayed for a very short period: 2 nights, but i would highly recommend The Bloomsbury to anybody.",5,2019,05,05
115,"Great stay, nice location!!!","Such a luxurious place to stay, the moment I walked in, the helpful door men Abudi & the green terrace is very welcoming. The check-in process was efficient and professional, then we asked about some suggestions for the tube transportation & an oriental cuisine restaurant to dine, the desk manager - Than was very kind and helpful, provided to us with many recommendations. 

Inside the hotel, the décor and artwork are so beautiful, the bar on the ground floor look amazing. The room is very clean with the comfy bed, I loved it! We had the brunch on Dalloway terrace and the atmosphere is so relaxing, delicious food, and the service is good. We definitely recommended this place and can't wait to stay again.",5,2019,05,05
115,Nice hotel in great area!,My wife and I stayed at The Bloomsbury for 3 nights.  Room was pretty and clean.  Staff is super-nice.  Hotel has a great bar and a decent breakfast.  Neighborhood is great for tourists (around the corner from British Museum) and a block from the tube.  We would definitely stay here again!,4,2019,05,04
115,Amazing,"I stayed in the Bloomsbury hotel with my family. We choose this place because of its location. We were surprised by the good atmosphere of the hotel. Also, the staff was really helpful, kind and professional specially Emanuel who helped us moving around the area, amazing advise.
Thank you.",5,2019,05,04
115,Beautiful hotel,"The Bloomsbury is a beautiful hotel! It is close to many shops and restaurants. The British Museum and the underground are a mere 5 minutes walk. 
We arrived in the morning, but the hotel was able to accommodate us and let us check in after we took our Afternoon Tea(delicious!)in the Dalloway Terrace. The Concierge inquired about what our son likes(we said Liverpool), and the next day when we returned at the end of the day, there was a special gift waiting for him(Liverpool mug, and a stationary set). What a nice gesture! 
Special shoutout to Helder, he was super friendly and nice. He took care to remember our names. He even gifted our son with a Fortnite toy. Our son was absolutely thrilled!
Our room was comfortable, and even with an extra rollaway bed, we did not feel cramped. Housekeeping was very good, our room was cleaned very well. 
Everyone we encountered in the hotel was welcoming and courteous. It was really lovely, and we hope to return soon.",5,2019,05,03
115,Amazing services,"I want to Thanks to Than - Duty Manager which made my visit remarkable, he was kind and very responsive to my queries. All staff was very welcoming. The door man Ivan was very helpful too. The location is lovely and the cocktail bar is outstanding.",5,2019,05,03
115,Still a go to place but again under partial construction,"Use this hotel for an overnight before a board meeting. It is convenient enough to Covent Garden, quiet (key in London), the staff are very friendly and helpful. My room this time was a bit small compared to prior stays (7th floor) but nice and quiet and they have everything in the room you should need incl tea and coffee facilities. Second time I've been there and they've been through some form of reconstruction. Not a big issue but disruptive, especially if you want to go to the toilet when in the bar, quite a circuitous trek and a lack of signs.",4,2019,05,03
115,Another wonderful stay,"This hotel deserves all the praise in the world. From the moment you enter the hotel to the time you leave you are treated wonderfully.  My room was on the fifth floor and was just as I expected.  The room is spacious and very comfortable.  I especially liked the underfloor heating in the bathroom.
Everyday I started with my breakfast in the breakfast room as usual the staff are very friendly and go out of their way to ensure you have everything you need. Special thanks to Maria, Victor,Marina and all the other staff I can't remember. (Sorry)
After a busy day its nice to come back and relax in your room or in the Library to prepare for a night in the theatres. On return from my nights in the theatre I always go to the Bloomsbury Club to have a relaxing drink in this wonderful bar.  Thanks especially to Simon who looked after me whilst I was there, its very nice for someone to take time to talk to you when you are on your own.
I am already trying to book my next visit to London theatreland and will stay here if I can get a reservation.
Highly recommend this beautiful hotel.",5,2019,05,03
115,Excellent all round,"Stayed for a theatre trip as conveniently located close to The Palace theatre. Arrived at 1pm to find room was already available. Staff were very friendly throughout the stay. Rooms are a reasonable size (for London!) and in good condition. Recommend a cocktail in the Coral Room, they are pretty pricey but the number and variety of drinks on offer is exceptional. Will be coming back next time we are going to the theatre!",5,2019,05,02
115,birthday weekend in london,"the first impression of the hotel is that it is difficult to find with the change of name at the front   myself and another couple walked up and down grt Russell street   it needs better signage and can be confused with the Bloomsbury street hotel   the reception is difficult to see as well   I met a couple who walked straight past it and I helped them find their way in
Abudi is amazing   he rushed out and helped me climb the steps with my suitcase  he smiled and was very friendly   he also helped me to the room with the bag although I said I would be ok he insisted on helping me   When we went into the room he found the aircon and explained how it worked and it was a very warm welcome 
Sebastian on reception also was interested what I was going to do in London this weekend and offered a treat as it was my birthday on sunday   Again very very friendly and welcoming   I always travel alone and to get this sort of welcome is very precious
The room was very clean 3 books on poetry the history of the hotel and places to shop a good supply of tea and coffee and coffee machine.   The attention to detail with the do not disturb signs and other signs with quotes of famous authors was the first time I had ever seen this   Full English breakfast lovely and when it was known it was my birthday I received a glass of mimosa and freshly made chocolates from the lady in the dining room 
The room was quite small however but the shower and bathroom area was amazing with marble. 
I would stay at the hotel again as it is in a perfect location for the British Museum and a direct northern line back to waterloo   However these two members of staff made my weekend special.",5,2019,05,02
115,Felt so at home,"We had a wonderful 2-night stay at the Bloomsbury as part of birthday celebrations.  The room was very comfortable and so was the bed! All the staff, without exception, were very friendly and helpful - we felt so relaxed and at home. The staff at breakfast were welcoming and genuine - a great start to the day. The afternoon tea at the Dalloway Terrace was absolutely exquisite and it's a lovely touch that the chef comes out to explain all the different breads/sandwiches and cakes.  The attention to detail is second to none. All in all, an unforgettable weekend. Thank you.",5,2019,05,01
115,Outstanding,"This is was my fourth stay at the Bloomsbury and the best yet, I was offered an upgrade to a junior suite which was beautiful and a complimentary cocktail, always appreciated.
 I ate in the Dalloway restaurant, the fish was very good and the service exemplary, the breakfasts are superb. Overall I would thoroughly recommend, all the staff are so friendly and helpful I’m looking forward to my next stay 
",5,2019,05,01
115,Lovely stay,"Love the breakfast service staff Maria, Marina, Ionut and Victor. Maria was really attentive and caring to the kids during our 5 nights stay there. When she knew my husband were bringing my kids to London Tower, she packed sandwiches for them.",4,2019,04,30
115,Best Price / Quality in London,"Having tried few hotels in London, this hotel is exceptional, especially when you look at the price. Usually, to get a similar quality in London, you'd need to pay much more.
The rooms are super clean, the staff is very professional, obviously well trained. 
There are two bars, both really cosy and ideal to have a drink after work and mingle with people.
The only (-) : 
- The gym is small and does not have enough equipments. 
",5,2019,04,28
115,Should I retire and move permanently to the Bloomsbury?,"Someone could say that my review is biased by my love for London but I guarantee it is not so. The Bloomsbury is the ideal place o stay while in London. Services is great, everybody is smiling at you and it really feels you are surrounded by friends. Breakfast is ideal; imagine that for the 4 days I stayed I ordered Bircher Muesli and omelette and only at the end of the fourth breakfast I was told that I was supposed to order only one item rather than two and of course no charge!
The room I had was very comfortable and by London standard quite large. I was pleasantly surprised to find a Nespresso machine in the room and when I asked for my favourite type of pods immediately they delivered quite a number of them.
I invited my Boss and his wife for a drink and we went to the Coral room. It has been a very pleasant meeting, service perfect and the music volume was ideal and it allowed us to have a normal conversation. The Dalloway Terrace is extremely popular and rightly so: lovely food and ambience. Bravi to the GM and to all the staff !!
One last thing: when you stay there make sure you visit the art shop right in front of the Hotel. It is right out of a Harry Potter's movie, do not miss it.",5,2019,04,26
115,When can I stay here again?,"Location is wonderful (though I had trouble finding the front door when I arrived at night), service is amazing, decor is beautiful, and the room comfortable. I'll start recommending this hotel to all London travelers.",5,2019,04,23
115,EXCEPTIONAL BOUTIQUE HOTEL,"I've been here two nights and can't say enough wonderful things about this lovely hotel. The location is perfect, down a quiet alley yet two blocks from SoHo. My room is extraordinary, large and cozy at once. The service staff are all courteous, wise, gracious, and just absolutely great people. In particular, Than, the shift supervisor, has been one of the most helpful and engaged people I've met, and ditto for Paolo, the concierge, who helped me with something for my daughter that literally saved my trip from being a disaster. I have stayed in five star hotels across the world, and I don't know that I've had too many comparable experiences to The Bloomsbury. And the bar and the terrace and the lounges are just gorgeously-appointed (the wallpaper is fabulous), clean, disarming, excellent all-around. Simply, WOW.",5,2019,04,23
115,Terrific Stay,Recently stayed 5 days in this terrific property. It is elegant and well maintained in a convenient yet quiet location. Most importantly the hotel staff makes you feel right at home and they are genuinely very friendly and committed to excellent customer service.,5,2019,04,22
115,I can't wait to be there again!!!!,"I can't wait to go to this hotel again. First of all, it's a beautiful place and the room was spacious and comfortable. Second, it has a great location! Literally two minutes away from Oxford St. and from the Totenham Court Rd tube station. Last but not least at all - the Coral Room Bar! Oh my goodness, that was the best of them all. The bar is beautiful and the drinks, although a bit pricy, are heaven. 
Breakfast downstairs was amazingly good, with a choice of eggs, cheese, whatever you like. The breakfast staff were extremely nice, especially the nice lady that greeted us every morning with such a great smile.
There is also a restaurant at the hotel which we had dinner on our last night, the food was very good and service delightful.
All in all, I think I finally found my favorite place to stay in London, will most definitely return, no doubts about it.",5,2019,04,22
115,Luxury London.,"Tucked away hotel which we were able to walk from London Euston very easily. Very friendly greeting on arrival & free upgrade to a luxury suite.
Whole hotel was very clean & tidy with attention to detail observed. 
Room was very large with bath & shower. All the usual tea, coffee & mini bar etc.
Breakfast in the morning was excellent, great choice & served at a good pace. There is a buffet choice but also the ability to choose from a menu of hot choices.
I would recommend having a drink in the Coral room, great decor with very friendly staff, no cocktail was a problem, and free nibbles!
Great location in London, the only reason we scored a four was at 7am Sunday morning we were woken by the sound of recycling bottles going on, not impressed!",4,2019,04,22
115,Outstanding 10+++,"All Staffs are very friendly , helpful and good service mind . Especially “Than and Renske” !! The hotel have a very good atmosphere and good location . The room is very clean and comfortable . Good value for money . Highly recommended !!!! ",5,2019,04,21
115,Excellent stay in Central London,"First and foremost, you can't ask for a more convenient location in central London and Covent Garden-area. The Tottenham Court Station is right around the corner but the hotel is tucked away enough that there isn't street noise. The Bloomsbury is also a 10-minute walk to great shopping and endless shopping in Soho. Truly a great area and location!

The hotel staff were amazing and friendly. A special kudos to the staff that helped with luggage and at the doors. They were always ready with a smile and greeted us every time we came and left the hotel. Check out was also really fast and easy with Than and Medelina. Even the staff at Dalloway Terrace, the charming on-site restaurant, was great and super friendly. Speaking of, we had a wonderful afternoon tea there!

We booked a standard room with a queen size bed. The room was a little small, but to be expected for central London. I especially liked that there were two robes in the room and the tea maker had 8 tea bags, plenty of sugar, hot chocolate, and shortbread cookies. The bathroom amenities were just ok...I noticed that there was no conditioner in the shower, and none was dropped off even after room service came by, so it just might not come standard at the Bloomsbury. 

Overall, a wonderful stay and I would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting London!",5,2019,04,19
115,Excellent Service,"The service team at the hotel was excellent. Everyone from the door man, reservation desk and dining room was super helpful. Given I was there for 5 days, I had the opportunity to meet many of the staff. The breakfast team in dining room was just great. Meeting me with a smile each morning, remembering where I sat the days before and the conversation we had the previous morning. This made business travel a bit more enjoyable knowing there were friendly faces that would greet me each morning.",5,2019,04,18
115,Weekend away,"Surprise weekend away for my birthday, hotel met all our expectations and more, room was perfect for our stay and very clean, lovely fresh smell. 
Bar and breakfast staff were very attentive, excellent service.
We will definitely stay here again.",5,2019,04,16
115,Superb overnight stay,"What a wonderful hotel, incredibly friendly and professional staff, made us feel very welcome. The hotel itself is gorgeous, easy to find and a 2minute walk from Tottenham court tube station. Slightly off the beaten track which is good as our room was quiet on the 5th floor. 

Try out the coral room bar for a cheeky cocktail, lovely ambience and again the bar staff were incredibly attentive.

Room itself was perfect, clean and comfortable. We didnt have breakfast as seemed expensive at £18 per head so opted instead for a nice little cafe round the corner, called Salt and Pepper. We will definitely stay here again, wish we were staying longer than 1 night. Double room cost around £210 and for a sat night in London that's really not bad. The service certainly made it value for money. Thank you very much for your hospitality!",5,2019,04,14
115,Very cool location,"Such a lovely hotel. Colorful and eclectic. 
My daughter and I shared a lovely room and were just down the hall from our friends but even though our rooms cost the same our room was definitly bigger. Howvwr both has incredibly comfortable beds and felt cozy. 
The restaurant just off the side  on the hotel was always busy and looked like a nice way to spend an afternoon or evening. The lounge was so full of color and beautiful. However remind yourself that you are on vacation ( if you are) because service is very slow. Delicious food though. 
There is a wonderful club in the  “basement” with live music and great ($$) drinks, wonderful atmosphere. 
You are minutes away from theatres and shopping and a mixture of neighbourhood and businesses. 
Very easy to get around and still not a long walk to the underground.",4,2019,04,13
115,Best hotel experience ever,"I treated my mum for her 60th to tickets to Motown the musical & an overnight stay in a nice hotel. We were expecting a lovely room at £350 a night but were pleasantly welcomed to the Bloomsbury with an upgrade to a suite, as we were picked to be “guest of the day” by the staff. This kickstarted what was to be a wonderful weekend for my mum & I.

The room was gorgeous with all amenities, including a Dyson hairdryer, robes, slippers & much more. We were entitled to a delicious plate of little macaroons, fruit and a complimentary cocktail downstairs in the main bar.

The bathroom was large with underfloor heating and an inviting walk-in shower, which just topped off the room.

We enjoyed some live jazz music in the evening in the lower ground bar with delicious cocktails and tasty free nibbles of olives and nuts, which were replenished; tap water was put instantly on the table as soon as bums were on seats.

Breakfast the next morning was delicious, hot food to order and every other breakfast item you could think of was served in buffet style.

The service in all areas of the hotel was incredible, all extremely friendly, helpful and knew exactly what was wanted when it was wanted. Excellent hotel, WILL definitely book to stay again. Thanks Bloomsbury!",5,2019,04,13
115,Luxury Spark Joy,I loved the moment I saw the hotel. The Bloommsbury personnell is very helpful. they help you with a smile and they are always willing to help you. The bed sleeps very well. The bathroom is luxury with a bath and a separate shower cabin. Breakfast is so nice and there is so much to choose of and the staff is so willing to help you.,5,2019,04,13
115,Holiday visit,"When we visited london last december with my family we had a great time and a relaxing holiday at this hotel, the staff are friendly and Mr. Than is very helpful and the hotel location is a plus because it is located in central london easy access to tourist spots, tube etc.",5,2019,04,11
115,Britain at its best. A magic place that truly sparks joy.,"You can't tell from the outside what a great experience you'll have here. Amazing staff - friendly, helpful, smiling, charming. Beautiful rooms. But best of all is all of the bars and hidden spaces to sit down & relax or enjoy something delicious. Lowed the Gentlemen & Thyme cocktail in the red bar. The music, the people, the excellent service. I really want to come back to this place and show it to my beloved ones. It's a treat. And you are worth it. It's because of places like this in Europe - I feel home in UK. Please remain.",5,2019,04,11
115,Quick business trip - wish it was longer,"This is a lovely hotel with great staff. Rooms are all different in size, but extremely clean, comfortable and nicely appointed. Highly recommend the Dalloway Terrace and Coral Room. Staff was excellent from start to finish.",5,2019,04,10
115,Professional service and feel-good atmosphere,"Fantastic hotel: the perfect location, the beautiful design and the incredible friendliness of the staff enabled me to enjoy my stay immensely. A special thanks to Marina, Maria, Ionut, Dimitar, Victor and Beatriz from the breakfast team! They treated me like family and made me feel precious and welcome every single day. This human atmosphere is a great asset for any hotel and is very rarely found in a city hotel. ",5,2019,04,09
115,Simply amazing!,"We were exhausted from traveling all night, and the staff made sure we were given a room immediately.  Our room was pleasant, clean and had everything we needed.The history of the Bloomsbury is fascinating, and we were excited to be a part of that. The Coral Room is the best bar, and the bartenders are mixologists, so you will enjoy wonderful creations.",5,2019,04,09
115,Weekend away,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury for a Saturday night. We arrived very early and stored our cases so we were free to do our sightseeing.  The rooms were wonderful and the staff so helpful and friendly.  You felt completely at ease.  After and great night at the theatre a drink in the Dalloway terrace bar listening to live Jazz was the perfect end to the day.  The amazing breakfast was the perfect start to the next.  On checking out we left our cases so we could enjoy the day and collected them before leaving for home.
Cant wait for the next visit",5,2019,04,09
115,Great service,"I stayed for a week at the Bloomsbury hotel
It was clean , the finishes of the hotel are great the staff were awesome a special mention to Maria Marina Victor for make me feel at home and giving me excellent service",5,2019,04,05
115,"Great stay, great location","We stayed twice at Bloomsbury hotel, in August 2017 y November 2018 and we were lucky to have twice the same room, but with different furniture since the room had been renovated in the meantime! The second time we could enjoy a bathtub in the room, a delight...! 
The last time we noticed that breakfast had been much improved. Service was very welcoming !
The location is great, near Soho and all its great restaurants, and also near Coven Garden.
We will definitely come back!",5,2019,04,04
115,New Home For London Business Trips,"Comfortable, warm, inviting, lively, casual chic, great service, friendly staff from checkin to checkout....How has it taken me 20+ years to find this place?  After horrible stays at other high-end West-end hotels, this is the new spot for me and deserves your careful consideration especially if you are used to other more well known luxe-luxury brands.  Quiet rooms handsomely appointed with comfortable beds, pillows, and decor hands down won me over.  Centrally located for work in the city and clients in the west, there is nothing shabby about this place which frankly beats several of its more expensive West-end competitors.  A million times better than the Scarfes Bar, The Coral Room has excellent bartenders serving perhaps the best cocktails in all of London.  They love their craft and it shows in the incredible diverse menu.  The restaurant does a fantastic job at delivering a quality product and was on point two out of four nights I ate there. Rib eye and duck were great and wine list was spot on for pairing.  All in all, as a very picky global traveler, I have finally had an amazing London hotel experience and can not wait to come back with family.  Kudos Bloomsbury! ",5,2019,04,03
115,The Bloomsbury hotel,We stayed at the Bloomsbury hotel fir eight nights and we enjoyed it very much. The rooms are very comfortable and the staff is very kind. The lobby is very nice and cozy and the bar is rich and the service is excellent.,5,2019,04,03
115,"Lovely hotel, tucked into convenient location for business or pleasure","First time visit after staying at several London hotels over the years. Well-appointed public spaces, excellent, super helpful staff. The location is near the Tottenham tube stop which is central to almost anywhere you would likely go in London for business or pleasure. Walking distance to plays if you have the evening off. We hosted a customer dinner for 20 in one of the dining rooms and the staff and food were perfect. A hotel certainly worth consideration.",5,2019,04,02
115,Lovely warm welcome and relaxing stay,What a great little find that is well located and on the one hand has a great buzz in the Coral Room while also having a real homely and cosy feel. The staff made great efforts to personally greet you daily. The rooms are well appointed and spotless. Tasty breakfast and the terrace is a perfect spot to grab 15mins outside for a coffee in calm environs. Definitely worth a visit!,5,2019,04,01
115,Exceptional,"This is the second time we have stayed at the Bloomsbury. The hotel is presented very well and the bars well run. Our rooms have always been very clean and comfortable. Location is excellent.
I would like to extend particular thanks to the reception and breakfast staff that couldn’t have been more attentive. We have already booked another stay for later this year. ",5,2019,04,01
115,"The Bloomsbury, a fantastic place to stay","With The Bloomsbury you get not only a fabulous building but friendly,efficient staff who immediately make you feel at home.  Our room was beautifully clean,cosy and comfortable. A little oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. Breakfast was wonderful.
The Bloomsbury doesn't feel like an hotel but a gentle, relaxed and elegant country house. ",5,2019,04,01
115,Consistently Best in Class,I have been staying at the Bloomsbury many times each year and for almost 7 years. The quality ever increases and the staff are absolutely lovely. You cannot go wrong here. It is located on a quiet street just minutes away from excellent transportation and the Heart of the Theater District in SOHO and Covent Garden.,5,2019,04,01
115,Exceptional hotel experience ,"Me and my wife visited friends in London for 3 nights and stayed at this lovely hotel. It’s perfect location (soho,regent st & tube all a short walk) and the wonderful staff, who created a cosy home away from home in such a bustling city, made the Bloomsbury the perfect option for us. ",5,2019,04,01
115,Excellent As Always ,"I’m a regular at The Bloomsbury, it’s centrally located with easy access to all London offers for business and leisure 

Staff are friendly, helpful and do a great job

Highly recommended, the Coral bar has blossomed into a great space with a nice vibe and great selection of crafted cocktails ",5,2019,04,01
115,Birthday Celebration Treat,"We enjoyed a special 70th Birthday celebration meal with our family and friends in the Seamus Heaney Library at the Bloomsbury and stayed in the hotel overnight.  The quality of food, service and decor were all excellent.  No wonder Seamus Heaney and friends liked it so much.
Christopher and Janet.",5,2019,03,30
115,fantastic and elegant hotel perfectly located,"i have been to The Bloomsbury Hotel on several occasions for work and have always enjoyed the elegant and personalized attention from the staff.   If it were a restaurant i would give it Michelin stars, particularly for the friendly and attentive staff.  In particular, Maria, Marina, Dimitar, Victor in the restaurant, and all of the wonderful and engaging barmen at the Coral Bar.  between the lovely and comfortable rooms, the bar, in house jazz club, living room with fireplace, and al fresco dining room, you almost dont need to leave the hotel.  Plus it is one block from the British Museum",5,2019,03,29
115,Perfect weekend break,"My partner and I decided that is time to have a weekend break just for the two of us and we choose London and this beautiful hotel. Our check in was smooth and professional done by Than, duty manager , which was amazingly polite and very helpful when dealing with our requests. The room was bright and cozy as we expected. Can’t wait to go back !",5,2019,03,26
115,Weekend away,"Stayed here for second time, the room was a lot smaller than our previous visit. We stayed two nights, after our first morning the shower gel etc wasn’t renewed so had to contact housekeeping to bring replacements. Small towels not replaced only large towels given. Could only plug hairdryer in bedroom but no mirror within reach of where we could plug in. Small hiccups but not what you expect when paying £240 a night.",4,2019,03,26
115,Lovely Stay in London,"A fantastic hotel just steps away from the Oxford Circle High Street.  I was in town for business and the hotel had everything I needed, from an exceptionally comfortable bed to any amenities I may have forgotten. ",5,2019,03,26
115,Full Satisfaction,"Excellent hotel, service and location. Very good breakfast. My stay was short, as with all business trips, which made the quality of the service even more important. Very efficient, polite and friendly staff. I also used the hotel car service for going to the airport - and was very satisfied. All in all, highly recommended!",5,2019,03,23
115,Wonderful service,Kudos to Maria and Victor who delighted every morning with their wonderful smiles and excellent service at breakfast. What a charming well appointed little hotel in a great central location. Nice little gym to start the day as well.,5,2019,03,23
115,An amazing hotel experience,"What an incredible experience. From the moment we arrived to The Bloomsbury we were welcomed by a friendly, genuine and professional staff group. The guest relations manager (Than) took us to our amazing upgraded room (421) which was beautiful and so spacious. The food was excellent and all of the little extras made for a very comfortable and lovely weekend break. Thank The Bloomsbury, Mark & Hannah",5,2019,03,23
115,Cannot fault The Bloomsbury!,"We stayed at The Bloomsbury in February for three nights as a treat for our anniversary - and let me tell you I cannot fault a single second of our stay. Tringa on reception checked us in, and from the moment we arrived she made every effort to ensure the comfort of our stay. Polite and professional, she provided information about the local amenities and tourist attractions, remembering our names and asking about our day once we returned of an evening. Excellent service. 
Our room was exceptionally clean and comfortable - we did not ever want to leave! The rooms are of an excellent standard, as are all of the reception and guest areas. The service truly makes this hotel what it is, I have never encountered such kind and professional hotel staff who go above and beyond to make guests' experience special. 
I cannot recommend this hotel enough and hope to come back for our next anniversary!!",5,2019,03,22
115,My experience in the bloomsbury hotel,"I stayed for five nights in the bloomsbury hotel. We had a very bad experience where they did not provide us with our pre requisites that we requested prior to the visit and they agreed on. The house keeping took my towels and lost it “they got me new ones” but still. Very bad costumer service, some rude staff. Very bad concierge service he’s not knowledgable of the area. The only three people that made the stay smooth and compensated for the other awful experience were Abudi, Micheal and Khaled. I would not recommend anyone to stay in this hotel. ",1,2019,03,20
115,The best stay in a long time!,The Bloomsbury Hotel has everything under one roof. It very much of a five star service when I recently found out it only four star property and I was quite surprise to see how splendid it is. I will be back again soon.,5,2019,03,20
115,Nice hotel,"I stayed at Bloomsbury for 1 night only, so I have experience regarding the basic hotel services. The hotel is nice, very clean and the staff is very friendly. The breakfast is basic - nothing special, but good quality. ",5,2019,03,18
115,Rita and Alex Fagan,"We stayed for 2 nights 4th to 6th march. We had a wonderful time, hotel is beautiful, our room was fab,  best of all, the staff are so helpful and friendly,  they couldn't do enough for us. Breakfast is FAB U LOUS , i would go back just for the breakfast. 
Thank you so much for making our stay so wonderful.",5,2019,03,13
115,Simply excellent,"Very nice hotel in a beautiful London area.  The staff is highly qualified, very professional and last but not least kind and friendly.  My room was a good size, beautifully furnished and very clean.  I enjoyed a drink in the Coral Room and breakfast the following morning.
I recommend The Bloomsbury to everybody, both for professional and leisure travel.",5,2019,03,13
115,Nice but bar service charges disappointing,"This is a nice comfortable hotel, with a good standard of furnishings, reasonable room size, and very good bar facilities. On the negative side, there was a view of a brick wall, coffee and tea facilities that were gave us two cups and saucers for 3 people, and only enough tea, coffee and milk for one drink for two people. In the bar we were charged a 12.50% service charge, despite being served at the bar, and in view of the high cost of drinks, that felt like a rip-off. Reception staff were not very helpful, and it took them 10 minutes to check me out, despite me telling them that I had a taxi waiting. There was no effort to apologise. Nice hotel, but it lets itself down in a few areas.",4,2019,03,12
115,A very nice hotel ,"Stayed in February for 3 nights and I really liked the hotel. Spacious rooms, all the facilities, good location  about 5 mins walk to Tottenham Court tube station so all in one a very nice hotel. Their little lobby area is very nice, reminding you of an era long gone where you can have a fost reading by the fireplace. Would return anytime. ",5,2019,03,09
115,A hub for literary and cerebral explorations,"The Jazz venue in the basement made some great drinks, but you have to get there early.  Small rooms of course, it's London after all, but they were comfortable. The rooms although small were situated as to make you feel like they were twice as large. Our view of the street below gave us a larger feel.  Try not to get a room facing a brick wall. The atmosphere is inviting and you have to eat outside on patio.  Even in the winter.  They give you a fur wrap and the heaters make dining there a special treat.  Think Doctor Zihvago meeting Virginia Wolf.  The front desk staffers are hip and can direct you to anywhere you want to be.  Walking around the area is full of pubs and shopping and transportation (the Tube). ",5,2019,03,01
115,Amazing stay!,"I stayed here for couple of nights with my friend and we had an amazing time.
The place is lovely, the bedroom nice with a really comfortable bed. The best thing is the service, that is what really makes the difference: we were welcomed by a really nice guy ( Argentinian) I think Emanuel is his name: professional and friendly and happy to help us with any query we had. Also Ivan at concierge gave us good tips about the area 
I would truly recommend this place",5,2019,02,27
115,Perfection Personified!,"We have stayed at The Bloomsbury many, many times on both business and pleasure trips, and they have never failed to delight us in all areas.  The staff is most attentive to every request and adds value at every turn.  The Head Concierge, Brain Murphy, provides world-class customer service in addressing every need, whether it's restaurant or theatre bookings, or suggestions of current must-sees, or finding that special, hard-to-find item that makes your stay so memorable.  Kudos to a great team!",5,2019,02,26
115,Fantastic stay at The Bloomsbury,My wife and I stayed in London this weekend to celebrate her birthday. We chose this hotel because of its locality but also the style of hotel we enjoy. We were certainly not disappointed. The staff were very courteous and had no hesitation in trying to please us during our stay. The Coral Room was a fantastic place to meet our daughters before we went out for dinner that evening and breakfast in the morning was lovely. Everything and more you would expect from a top quality hotel. Probably our only disappointment would be the size of the room and the shower but this is undoubtedly down to the age and not being able to change the room floor space/size etc. Although we will definitely return in the near future. ,5,2019,02,26
115,Lovely weekend,"£209 for a twin room, one night with breakfast was worth every penny. Tea/ coffee facilities in the room. 
We went down for breakfast at 8:30 am. Full buffet, fried eggs were made to order. It was very tasty. 
Carlos on reception was very helpful as my husband discovered  5 hrs after we checked out that he left a jacket in the room. Because of their good practices in place it was found. 
I did notice that the Queue to be seated for breakfast around  10:30 was a little large. Still, well worth the wait. We will definitely book here again.",5,2019,02,24
115,Amazing night's sleep,"I was in London for business and booked the Bloomsbury as it was in a convenient location. I felt welcomed from the minute I arrived. My room was spotless. The bed was extremely comfortable. It was the best night's sleep I had in a long time. So good in fact, that I slept through the alarm I'd set on my phone! Next time I'll accept the morning wake up call that I was offered at reception.

Breakfast had a selection of a buffet or the ability to order off the menu. I had fruit salad from the buffet and some hot food and coffee. The staff were very accommodating to the change I made to my breakfast.

I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again in the future.",5,2019,02,22
115,Pleasent,"In one word it's ""perfect"". Everyone smiling, clean rooms, fresh air in rooms. Actually I don't have time for this and I'm trying to fill up this box, so it let me continue to other page, it still want some letter and im getting bored right now, oh it's done already, by.",5,2019,02,20
115,A hotel in London that hits all the right spots!,"Great location? Yes,
Great service ? Yes
Comfy beds? Yes, 
Very clean? Yes, 
Good breakfast ? Wonderful!

 I have stayed at The Bloomsbury 3 times in the last couple of years and have ALWAYS had a wonderful stay. The staff are super friendly and helpful and the hotel has that personal touch which is missing from so many others. 

Its a 4 star hotel but feels closer to a 5 star. By far the best 4 star hotel I have ever stayed in that's for sure!

The location is close to everything - less than 5 minute walk to major underground station (Tottenham Court Road) and less than 10 mins walk to Theatreland, 3 minutes to Oxford Street shopping!

There's a Sainsbury's supermarket around the corner for the essentials and next to it Amazon lockers to pick up all your on-line purchases (inside the Barclays Bank). 

I could go on and on - it really is my ""go to"" hotel in London",5,2019,02,19
115,Wonderful service and so welcoming,We stayed here for a single night and were treated impeccably the whole time. The room was magnificent. The Coral room  was a great spot for a night cap. No issues asking for gluten free toast with breakfast. However the overwhelming experience was made by the staff particularly the young man who helped with our bags.,5,2019,02,18
115,Excellent hotel - with a great location.,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is near Tottenham Court Road tube, so very central but not in the most selective part of the West End.  However, with purely a five minute walk to Oxford Street and ten minute walk to the theatre district, it offers five star luxury at reasonable prices.  We stayed on a Friday night, having been to the theatre on Shaftsbury Avenue, and finished the evening on the amazing terrace with food and a beautiful glass of wine.  The service was friendly, professional and informative.  We will definitely be returning.  ",5,2019,02,18
115,Excellent Hotel,"Amazing stylish hotel. The staff are so friendly, especially at breakfast and in the Coral Bar.  I loved the attention to detail from the moment we booked in until the moment we left.  One of the best hotels I have stayed in when visiting London.",5,2019,02,17
115,"Fantastic Hotel, average room.","I haved stayed at the Bloomsbury previously and love the sub level cocktail bar, and outdoor seating area. The new renovated reception turned bar, is also a great addition. The location is great for tube and Euston station and the British museum. You may wonder why only 3 stars, and that is all down to our room. We booked a Classic, which has been adequately stocked for our needs in the past, however this one was lacking somewhat. There was some maintenance needed on the toilet flush, I thought it was going to come off in my hand. (This was reported) The other issue was the air con, which was woefully inadequate. We tried to set the temperature at its lowest setting of 16 degrees, and it would default to 18. Fair enough, its not the middle of summer, and so 18 should be fine, that is, if the fan can blow better than a 1 year old child attempting to blow out their candles on their birthday. Needless to say, it was a very uncomfortable nights sleep and we decided to leave early in the morning. 

We we stay again, yes, absolutely but I would insist on a better room next time. ",3,2019,02,17
115,Valentines stay ,"Another wonderful stay at our favourite boutique hotel arrived on valentines day to stay in a fantastic room on the 6th floor thanks to Sebastian Annandale who always welcomes us with a smile along with all his staff been coming here for 9 years now and hopefully for the next 9 years. 5 star service from all the staff here from the coral lounge including Brian and the bloomsbury bar staff including Charlotte also live music in the downstairs bar which has a great atmosphere and vibe  a must visit when staying here.Breakfast is a nice way to start your day here always been fabulous food and always freshly cooked from the menu along with the cereals fresh bread,rolls,and juices,very friendly breakfast staff with ionut ,victor, Maria always welcome you with a smile back again this year. THIS IS A FABULOUS BOUTIQUE HOTEL TO STAY IN FOR A WEEKEND BREAK OR A LONGER STAY 5STAR SERVICE ALL ROUND ",5,2019,02,16
115,An Oasis just of one of the busiest parts of London,"This was a truly pleasurable stay. I stay in many more hotels than I review. Either reviewing the really good or the truly awful, not commenting on the mediocre.

Thankfully this was the former and a fantastic experience, from booking until leaving. I found their very human booking system and staff to be excellent arranging a complimentary small birthday cake for wife on our day of arrival.. just one of things they enquire about.

The door staff and reception staff extremely curious and friendly, as were all staff. The bar area is very stylish yet comfortable and breakfast is great.

Our room was quiet luxurious and very well appointed. Clean and quiet.

All in all, we could have not asked for more and the staff made our two night  stay very special for my wife's Birthday.

Highly recommended.",5,2019,02,15
115,30th Wedding Anniversary ,"This is our 4th visit to The Bloomsbury since our daughter moved to work in London in 2017. This visit was a very special visit as we were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary. 
My husband had mentioned that when booking and on our arrival at reception you can imagine my delight when the lady told us that we had been upgraded ...... room 521 which was the room we stayed in when we visited for my birthday last September. 
Everything is just amazing in this hotel.... the staff are so helpful and have an amazing ‘can do’ attitude where nothing is a problem. 
Our daughter joined us for breakfast each morning and thoroughly enjoyed the wide variety of vegetarian options and the fantastic welcome we got from Maria and her team. They couldn’t have been more hospitable. 

But the most AMAZING THING HAPPENED....... we went out to see a westend show and when we returned our bedroom had been decorated with balloons, heart shaped confetti, champagne, chocolate strawberries and a lovely Anniversary gift from The Bloomsbury team!  How does this happen I ask?  I went down to reception and met with a lovely guy called Than we was aware of it all and was so happy with my delight at the fabulous surprise. He was so sweet and charming. 
We were walking in romantic haze as a result and went online a have already booked a return trip for my birthday in September....... can’t wait. 
Thank you everyone in The Bloomsbury..... you are fantastic and a wonderful place to stay for a bit of luxury and spoiling xx

",5,2019,02,13
115,Ms. M. Cristina Lagnado,"Perfect location.
Very nice rooms, good bathroom, nice amenities.
Service improved so much, I’m so glad about that.
Restaurants are excellent.
I have to mention amazing work by two maintenance men: Adam and Roy.
Will be back many times, had a wonderful time!",5,2019,02,13
115,A fantastic stay!,"Rarely do I find hotels so genuine and inviting - The Bloomsbury truly blew me away! I was traveling from Los Angeles (in London for the first time!) and I must say that I felt incredibly spoiled by the staff and amenities that the Bloomsbury had to offer. It was a dream stay, and I cannot wait to stay again. Breakfast was especially special, having so many vegan options!! I experienced the best breakfast of my life here, no kidding. I loved visiting the lounge in the evening with a live jazz band. Everything about this place is enchanting and I can't recommend it enough. ",5,2019,02,12
115,Excellent return visit,"Last time we stayed here, we didn't have a good experience, however, the hotel did everything possible to make this visit perfect.  The room was spacious, staff helpful and polite, and breakfast was to order, rather than a hot buffet, which went down very well.  Will stay again.",5,2019,02,10
115,My New Favourite London Hotel,"It's the little things that make you fall in love with a hotel.  Any place can do luxury, but when you feel that the designers/staff have actually put thought and care into your experience, you know you're on to a winner.

This glorious hotel is in the heart of London, yet once inside it felt like I could have been staying in a tiny country hotel.  It felt intimate, yet spacious.  The decor is  tasteful and sumptuous.  I was unfortunately staying just one night for business; I wish I could have stayed for a week.

My bedroom felt airy, with a huge bed, two large comfy chairs and lots of drawers and wardrobe space.  The bathroom was luxurious and contained a big bath and a proper heavy door, which is so important to me; any guest could be happy knowing the bathroom was totally private from any other guest in the bedroom.  The big bathroom  mirror did not steam up.

There was a large desk and chair with a huge mirror behind it, plus a freestanding mirror that I could easily pick up and move, and a variety of lighting that I could use at this desk - this is essential for a woman who wants to actually sit down to do her make-up in the morning!  

The wide array of complimentary tea and coffee, plus Nespresso machine, was welcome.  The bed linen and bathrobe was very high quality.  The breakfast was varied with first-rate ingredients and the dining room felt spacious.  All the hotel staff that I met could not have been more helpful.  

This hotel is a gem.",5,2019,02,10
115,Great location and wonderful staff.,"First stay at The Bloomsbury, when in London for work. Lovely hotel, and the staff are an absolute credit to the place. Very warm welcome upon check-in, and excellent service from all bar staff in the Coral Bar.
The room was good-sized with a very comfortable bed. No noise from the road. Large bathroom, with underfloor heating a welcome surprise given that the weather was very cold!
I didn't eat at the hotel, so can't comment on the food experience.
Great location for sightseeing or work. Very close to Tottenham Court Road tube station. British Museum 5 minute walk away. 
I would definitely stay here again. It's not cheap, but it is worth the expense.",5,2019,02,10
115,Another lovely stay,This was our second stay at the Bloomsbury and we were blown away once again! We absolutely love how attentive the staff is and how gorgeous the hotel is. No detail is left undone! We opted to have breakfast on the Dalloway Terrace once we arrived and the scenery was out of this world! We returned that night for drinks at the Coral Room and every staff member made sure we had a table and were taken care of. We love the Bloomsbury! We look forward to staying again- maybe I can convince my husband to come for my 30th birthday?! ,5,2019,02,09
115,We didn't want to leave the hotel,"It was one of the best stays in London. The Room was cozy and comfortable and the staffs were very friendly and helpful specially Mr. Tahn!! He really made us feel like home!! 
The hotel itself has a very elegant look and feel to it. overall I highly recommend this hotell!!",5,2019,02,09
115,"Great service, great bar and great sleep!",This was my third visit and it did not disappoint. Staff are so friendly and helpful especially at breakfast - which is also delicious with lots of tasty healthy options. Rooms are not large however they have everything you need including luxe toiletries and a coffee maker. The coral room is my favourite bar in London - try the Margaritas. My room service favourite is the harissa prawns.,5,2019,02,08
115,Exceptionally pleasant stay,"I stayed 3 night at the Bloomsbury with my daughter. We had the most wonderful experience, from the friendly staff and super comfortable room to the wonderful refreshing smell :-)! The location is fantastic as well. We had no complaints whatsoever. I would highly recommend!",5,2019,02,06
115,Soooo good,"This hotel is the best I’ve experienced on London. Perfect location and the friendliest staff ever! Having a nasty flue, the nice waiter in the bar sent me a cup of ginger tea and honey as a surprise. How nice can that be? A strong recimmendation and a warm thank you! ❤️ ",5,2019,02,05
115,Business Event,"There were many aspects of this trip that were great and the crew really excelled in their service.  The majority of the crew were welcoming, very friendly and keen to help.  A few names to mention here - Marina and Estelita in the restaurant, Ivan at concierge and Samir in M&E.

It was unfortunate that we also experienced some rather bad service which was disappointing to say the least and tainted our stay.",3,2019,02,05
115,Gem in a great location,"Lovely hotel/ Staff very welcoming and helpful, and an ideal location for all needs in London. Room was nice with a very comfortable bed. Bathroom with under-floor heating was perfect considering the cold weather! Didn't eat at the hotel, but the Coral Bar is very good. Had great service and a cracking selection of gins, in particular.As far as London hotels go, The Bloomsbury is very high up on my list of the best. ",5,2019,02,04
115,Stay at The Bloomsbury hotel,"Well located hotel, quite comfortable, the rooms are quiet. We just regret that our bathroom was not provided with a flexible shower, just a highpositionned one. Kind of a shame for an hotel of this category and price. We booked this hotel with a package in which the breakfast was included, but it was charged on the invoice : we had to insist in order to get it corrected?",4,2019,02,02
115,London like it should be,"Such a COZY hotel in the midst of a chilly, soggy London winter! Had to tear ourselves away from our comfortable room, away from the warming fire in the lobby, away from the majestic palms in the restaurant to go out to explore. Fortunately The Bloomsbury has a fantastic central location so there is a plethora of things to do right at your doorstep, starting with the British Museum just down the street and ending with the Soho theaters. So pleasant just to walk a few blocks back after a Saturday night play and dinner. Staff was agreeable and helpful throughout with taxis there is seconds. Made a short stay seem way too short.",5,2019,02,02
115,Lovely. ,"Excellent high class hotel with lovely bars staff and food. Was there for work so business facilities were also very good.

Nice place to be if you want to have a lovely relaxing stay in central London.

Great location comfortable rooms spotlessly clean, funky bars - I loved it.

Stayed 6 years ago and it’s still lovely. I would definitely go back.",5,2019,02,02
115,Second home in London,"Stayed at the Bloomsbury a full week for a business trip. Felt like home by the time I left. Hotel was immaculate, cozy and uniquely British. Staff was exceptional (esp my boys at the Coral Room Mattia and Gabriele). Looking forward to my next trip to London to come back!",5,2019,01,31
115,Poor Service,"When The Bloomsbury works, it's great: unfortunately, that doesn't happen all the time, nor is it consistent. It seems to depend who's on duty, who the staff are and who's answering the front desk. From early check-ins that don't happen to infrequent room cleaning, the impression is one of great glam and razzmatazz but little substance. It's a shame: it's a beautiful building, wonderful location and generally very friendly staff but if you're charging 5-star prices, you really ought to provide at least 4-star service.",3,2019,01,30
115,Amazing stay!,"Me and my boyfriend had such a lovely time, and the service is excellent. The room was perfect, and the overall environment is modern and luxurious! Would recommend staying at the Bloomsbury hotel to anyone!",5,2019,01,29
115,Special Weekend,"This is my second stay at this hotel.  I am still a very fussy guest and they still exceed my expectations.  You are made to feel very special from the moment you are greeted.  Lovely staff, high quality service and a great location!  I never regret booking here and will be back again as the opportunity shows itself.",5,2019,01,28
115,Wounderful Stay,"Initimate hotel with great acessability. Friendly, serviceminded personel. The atmosphere of the hotel with cosy interior and veranda is fabulous. The feeling we tangeld with was to leave the hotel and see the rest of London. Very good value for money. Definitely coming back here. ",5,2019,01,28
115,Luxury and location at a reasonable price,"Fantastic location, beautifully appointed hotel with amazing attention to detail. Staff were incredibly friendly and there were many touches that made for a memorable stay. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a classy (but reasonable) stay in central London.",5,2019,01,28
115,Three Nights,"The staff at this hotel are very nice.   The hotel is nice and clean.  It's in a decent location with food within walking distance.  My issue was our room was right, and I mean right off the elevator.  Found it to be noisy.   The rooms are VERY dark as the windows for our room looked into a courtyard that was surrounded by four walls.  
The shower, albeit newly done was SMALL and the door didn't seal allowing water on the floor.   Not sure what they can do about the size of the showers now and maybe all rooms were not like this, but ours was SMALL.  The lighting in the bathroom was hard to put on makeup.   I wouldn't return to this hotel.  Many other options in London.",4,2019,01,27
115,"Beautiful hotel, exceptional service, great location ","Stayed for one night on a Saturday in January. The hotel is beautiful. We had lunch in the dalloway terrace which was wonderful. Our room was upgraded (thanks!) and really lovely. Enjoyed a night out followed by breakfast brought to our room in the morning. Late checkout as standard which is also brilliant. The service and staff are just wonderful. Loved it and would definitely stay here again.  
",5,2019,01,27
115,Great to be back at the Bloomsbury!,"We have stayed at the Bloomsbury on a number of occasions and always enjoy being there.  The location is excellent, the staff are welcoming and efficient (and obviously enjoy working there).  And the rooms are very comfortable.  ",4,2019,01,24
115,Lovely Hotel  Great Location,"A lovely hotel near Dickens House, British Museum, British Library, tube and LOTS of eateries. I prefer places I can walk from and this was ideal for my interests.  Also nice to walk late at night in a well lit , well traveled area.",5,2019,01,23
115,"Great stay, friendly staff","Stayed for 2 nights with my mum for her birthday.  Great hotel, helpful and friendly staff.  Clean, spacious and comfortable twin room.  Would have liked the lights to be a little brighter, purely for make up purposes!  Loved the Coral bar, small plates of food were excellent pre-theatre.  Good jazz on Friday night.  Overall a super stay, would definitely book again.",5,2019,01,23
115,The Bloomsbury,"We had truly memorable stay at The Bloomsbury hotel. There was nothing to fault our stay from the warm welcome we received when we arrived, clean room, delicious food to flawless check out. The staff was amazing, made us feel welcomed and nothing was a trouble for them. Special thanks to the guest relations manager Than, who  made our stay extra special. We are certainly looking forward to returning to The Bloomsbury again.",5,2019,01,23
115,"Friendly staff, beautiful facility","There was smiling, friendly, welcoming staff at every station: from the first greetings to the front desk to the room service and restaurants, everyone was very accommodating.  I was sick and asked for a late checkout which was kindly obliged--and I was asked if I needed anything extra like waters, etc.  So considerate.  I added breakfast which was excellent with lots of options--and the juice bar had a great menu as well.  Room was spacious and clean with everything I needed.  Will be returning again for sure.",5,2019,01,19
115,"Fabulous service, fabulous location, fabulous hotel!!","This hotel is just the best. I have returned many many times over the years & recommend it to everybody! The location is perfect & within walking distance of Oxford Street, the rooms are lovely & spotless, the service first class & the breakfast just amazing! I can't wait to return!",5,2019,01,17
115,Amazing service and excellent staff!!,"Had a fantastic stay at The Bloomsbury. Every moment was exceptional. The hotel is beautiful and well appointed, the staff professional and courteous, and the dining was delicious. The following staff made our stay extra special as they went above and beyond; Dimitar and Victor, Georgia, and the concierge, Ivan. We will definitely stay again when we return!",5,2019,01,17
115,Warm and cozy! ,"The Bloomsbury is quite stunning on the outside, with a gorgeous terrace wrapped around the front. It’s in a great location and a bit pushed back so you feel some privacy. The service is fantastic and there is much to explore right in the hotel and the streets surrounding. The rooms are a bit small and can get warm but a perfect spot if you’re looking for something in the heart of the city. ",4,2019,01,16
115,Amazing relaxing business trip,"I’m over in London frequently for work but this was my first time staying at the Bloomsbury. It exceeded all expectations, and their attention to detail for the traveling business person is incredible. My bathroom was stocked with all things that I want but hotels normally don’t have, and the mini bar and snack bar had thoughtful luxury choices. My deluxe studio room was gorgeous, the bed is massive and comfortable. The guest services manager Than knew me by name and greeted me each day. Both of the bars in the hotel are wonderful, offering friendly staff and delicious cocktails. Absolutely recommend this hotel for a peaceful relaxing stay amidst busy work weeks. ",5,2019,01,16
115,Great service and beautiful hotel,"The Bloomsbury is a gorgeous, well situated, compact hotel. There were a few hiccups in our stay, beyond the control of the hotel, and the professional and personal way in which they handled things showed that this hotel takes service and its guests very seriously. For this reason and more, an enthusiastic 5 star review. 

I will start with the many positives of this hotel.
The beautiful design and warm inviting spaces makes the hotel truly special- a real retreat amidst the bustle of the city.  Loved the Coral Room, where the drinks and service were superb.
Breakfast: Fabulous. Great buffet as well as a la carte choices. Terrific service. Example: a server helped me put together a carefully arranged tray of food for my son who was sleeping late and going to miss breakfast. Even on a busy morning, she made time for this special effort. Much appreciated. Sorry I didn't get her name. 
Concierge: What can I say, Naleef and team managed to get us much sought after Arsenal tickets!  They made it seem like no trouble at all, but I later found out this was a real challenge for them. The game was a highlight of the trip and a big thank you is in order. 
Room: Compact but very comfortable. Very good beds and surprisingly quiet room. Happy we had a nice deep tub as well as shower. Could have used a little more storage space for two people.
 
Now a little background on the hiccups and how things were handled so well.
First: My son and I were assigned a beautiful, two bedded room at first.  Unpacked everything for a four day stay and got settled. It soon became clear that there was going to be a real noise issue with the neighbours. Instead of only warning them about the noise (which they did), and waiting to see if things would get better, the hotel agreed to move us. This was not so easy over a full New Year's period, and took some time. The new room was smaller and not quite as nice as the first, but we accepted and appreciated their effort. Without our asking, the manager checked in with us to see if we were settled comfortably, and offered to comp us part of our stay.  A very nice gesture. 
Second hiccup: We were planning to use the gym daily during our stay. The day we arrived, water damage had closed the gym area and it remained closed for our whole stay.  When the hotel heard we were asking about the gym, the gym manager searched us out to apologise in person. A small but appreciated and professional gesture.

In summary: during a very busy period, the Bloomsbury managed to make us feel like appreciated guests, and deftly dealt with small issues with excellent service. The hotel was comfortable and lovely. Thank you and we will be back!",5,2019,01,16
115,Definitely recommend,"This is a superb hotel with outstanding service from all the staff. We felt very welcome from the moment we arrived. Our original room was next to the noisy elevator. When we requested a room change, the only one available was a slightly inferior room. We were still very happy with the room and they gave myself and my wife free breakfast to compensate us. The interior is stylish with great decor. The room we had was still a good size and very comfortable. Would strongly recommend eating in the dellaway restaurant and enjoying a cocktail in the Coral room. We will definitely be coming back.
A word of warning however, book directly with the hotel. We did it through Expedia and it was an additional £50 to cover their fees. No fault by the hotel but still felt we had been ripped off by the greedy travel company.",5,2019,01,12
115,Just about as good as a hotel can get,"The stay at the hotel was a birthday present.  This hotel has really got everything going for it and that includes great staff and brilliant service.  The location is exactly where it should be allowing you to enjoy everything London has to offer, in real life the  hotel is better than it photographs and the facilities are accessible and enjoyable.  Easily one of the best hotels we have stayed at.  The English breakfast was freshly cooked to perfection -  definitely one to stay at: if you get the chance go for it.",5,2019,01,09
115,The must-see hotel to stay in London," Ideally located in London, The Bloomsburry Hotel is very comfortable and affordable. The staff is always at your disposal with a smile and a great professionalism. The particularly cosy rooms make you feel at home with all the necessary comfort and room service. I highly recommend this hotel ",5,2019,01,09
115,"Excellent hotel, very welcoming staff and overall quality. Met every expectation and move","Excellent hotel, very welcoming staff and overall quality. Met every expectation and more. We had a beautiful, clean suite. When we returned from the theater, we had a table reservation at the coral room, where the staff already knew that we were celebrating our engagement and were very friendly. All the matradees came over to wish us well and we had a surprise cake brought to our table. Truly felt that everything was taken car of and we could just relax. Will definitely be revisiting in the future. ",5,2019,01,09
115,Bloomsbury Hotel,We absolutely LOVED our stay at the Bloomsbury! The staff was so friendly and went over and above to make our stay excellent.  The food was delicious-we loves the breakfast! The Coral Room Bar was so much fun and the drinks were fabulous.  We will definitely stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel again.  Its location is so convenient.,5,2019,01,08
115,Relaxing time at the Bloomsbury,"Had a nice one night stay here whilst visiting friends. Lovely,well appointed room on the sixth floor. All clean, spacious and elegant. Enjoyed the Coral bar before going out and on return. Its  a lovely bar, just a tad expensive. All the staff were pleasant and welcoming. If you are looking for a hotel in this area, I'd put this one on your short list.",5,2019,01,08
115,A really good hotel in a great location.,"Check in was courteous and efficient. Room service was fast and accurate.  The bathroom was clean and well appointed,  and the linen was of high quality. A comfortable nights sleep in a quiet room - perfect.",4,2019,01,08
115,Lovely stay,"Fab location, lovely comfy room, amazing cocktails in the coral room. Everything looked beautiful, hope to revisit so we can try the restaurant and other facilities as the only bad point was that the stay was too short!",5,2019,01,08
115,Excellent,"Me and my other half stayed here for NYE and we were very impressed. The staff were lovely and whilst it was quite ""fancy"" I never felt like anyone was looking down at us. The room was very comfortable and the building was stunning. Highly recommended",5,2019,01,07
115,Charming...Relaxing...Intimate,"I stayed at The Bloomsbury back in September 2018 on a business trip.  When I decided to return for the holidays, there was no other place that I wanted to inquire about.  The hotel is conveniently located to many tourist attractions.  I love to walk, and found this to be a great base to start from.  All of the staff were extremely friendly and ready to assist with any specific need(s). There are some that like the feel of a larger hotel with a lot of fancy amenities, but I found The Bloomsbury to be charming, relaxing and intimate.  I'm looking forward to staying there again.",5,2019,01,07
115,Great Stay,This is a lovely boutique hotel. Staff were very friendly and the bars were lovely.  Rooms nice and spacious. I found it a little bit further away from covent garden etc than I thought and this was its only downfall for me.,4,2019,01,07
115,Fabulous Property and Fantastic Location!,"Elegantly designed hotel throughout. Small enough to receive personal attention but large enough to include a variety of dining options and common rooms .  Our guest room was attractive, clean, comfortable, quiet and the in room amenities were king! The Bloomsbury Hotel supplied us with a generous amount of designer toiletries, endless Nespresso coffees, biscuits, bottled water, hot chocolate, etc.  It was such a pleasure to wake up and come home to this. 
Location can't be beat - subway around the corner, walking distance to Covent Garden and dining, Oxford street within a 5 min walk and British Museum 1/2 block away. The Bloomsbury Hotel staff were wonderful and they went above and beyond, in particular our Guest Experience and Quality Manager. We had communicated with her a number of times regarding our upcoming stay and she helped make our visit SUPER special during Christmas. Will gladly return on a future visit!",5,2019,01,06
115,Design hotel with wonderful staff - a perfect combination for a centrally located hotel,"We spent five nights at the Bloomsbury Hotel over Christmas and can only recommend this hotel. It has a very stylish, modern design und exceeds expectations with regard to the friendliness of the staff. 

Why we rate this hotel with five stars:

1. The breakfast is fantastic. There is not just a buffet as in many hotels, but you can order freshly made meals for breakfast. We tried the full English breakfast, the pancakes with lemon curd, the acai fruit bowl, the eggs Benedict and Florentine and the omelette - everything was very delicious. Really a perfect way to start the day.

2. The staff is amazing and extremely friendly and helpful. Especially the team in the breakfast room is fantastatic. We very much appreciated the service of Ionut, Estelita und their colleagues. We also appreciated the service in the beautiful Coral Room Bar und the reception team did a great job as well.

3. The hotel has a very classy, modern design. The rooms are modern and cosy, the Coral Room Bar ist extremely cool and also the Sitting room has a lot of flair. Dalloway Terrace is unique and very popular.

Things to consider:

1. The hotel is very centrally located. Many rooms do not offer  a lot of a view, but we certainly didn't miss that.

2. During the night, the rooms were perfectly quiet and we slept very well. The boxspring beds are extremely cosy. In the evenings and in the mornings we could hear music from the bar or sounds from other rooms, but this was not disturbing and may be different in other rooms.

3. The breakfast room is on the lower ground and therefore offers no daylight. 

What could be improved:

As a family of four, we had to book two rooms at full price. It would be great if this hotel, as other family friendly hotels do, offered families the second room with a discount.",5,2019,01,06
115,You won't regret it...,"This hotel made our vacation stay a success 2018/2019. Starting from the front desk, hotel bar, breakfast buffet, and the maintenance staff deserve great praise for their courteous and professional manner.

Our room was so cozy, it was hard to leave and venture out. 

So much to say about this place...

Highly recommend!",5,2019,01,06
115,Cheerful time at Christmas at the Bloomsbury,"My husband and I stayed at the Bloomsbury right before Christmas.  What a beautiful, boutique hotel to relax in!  After getting off a plane from San Francisco, we are just exhausted.  Abudi greeted us with a great big smile and quickly grabbed our bags, leaving us to check in at the front desk.  From there, we grabbed cocktails and nibbles at the Coral Room, which Stefan, one of the nicest bartenders, helped us with.  He even gave us a hand in running them up to our room, I think he noticed we were a little worn out, ha. 

The hotel itself is so pretty, very unique and personal.  If you're looking for a bland, chain hotel, like everywhere else, this is NOT the place.  This hotel has character, charm, each design element is so well thought out.  The rooms are spacious and the beds are very comfortable.  It's perfectly located in London so you can pop in and out, exploring what the city has to offer. 

The food at breakfast was so yummy.  On the weekends, they have a full English breakfast station, with other delcious foods laid out if a fry up isn't your style.  Maria and Ionut were quick to get us anything we needed.  You can also order fresh juices from the menu at breakfast, in case you need a little boost of health in between sightseeing.  The Dalloway Terrace is also another spot in the hotel which you can enjoy a drink or a plated breakfast. The last time we were in town, we ate there with my MIL one morning and it was so lovely on a nice day.

I can't say enough nice things about this place.  There are so many hotels in London, it's hard to find a good one, but with the Bloomsbury, our search is over.  We are looking forward to coming back on our next trip!",5,2019,01,03
115,Bloomsbury Stay,"Amazing hotel with amazingly attentive staff. Really enjoyed our brief vacation here. Hotel location is very central and rooms are very comfortable, perfect for unwinding after a 12 hour flight. Hit the fancy Coral Room bar when you’re ready.

We had great service from Stefan at the bar and a warm welcome at breakfast every morning from Maria and Lonut.

Highly recommend, we will be back for sure.",5,2019,01,03
115,Simply Remarkabe,"It was indeed one of the best hotels that I have stayed in recent times.  I booked the studio king suite and was blown away with the size of the room.  The hotel itself is totally charming with it's bold design and use of oriental colours.  For instance, the coral room is modelled after the Chinese red coral which gives a twist to the whole bar.  What differentiates this hotel from the others that I have stayed is truly it's team of staff members.  Previously I stayed at the sister hotel, The Marylebone which I love it as well but nothing comes close to The Bloomsbury in terms of personal service.  When I was pickpocketed, Dale, Concierge, went the extra mile to assist me out of the difficult situation.  This is a testament of what empathy means, Than Min, Guest Relations Manager gave us an extremely warm welcome and I absolutely love the choice of words which he use to give guests a huge peace of mind.  The housekeeper Esta seriously took very good care of us.  When I asked for more water and toiletries, she really gave us a lot in ensuring that we stay hydrated.  At the breakfast room, Marinara, Estelita, Maria and their team of servers made good effort in remembering our preferences immediately after our first day of stay.  Dalloway Terrace reminds me of NYC famed restaurant Park Avenue Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter where the theme of the restaurant will fit according to the season.  In this case, Dalloway Terrace put up a stunning display of Winter.  Although it was just a five day stay, it was absolutely memorable and there are just too many good reviews that I can rattle about.  ",5,2019,01,02
115,Bloomsbury Hotel In London,"Had a lovely stay at the Bloomsbury with my family during the Christmas holiday. Great location: short walk to theatre district, 25 minute walk to Buckingham Palace, 2 blocks from the British Museum, 3 minute walk to nearest tube station (Tottenham Court Road), etc. Purchased breakfast for two of the four mornings we were there . . . well worth it. We ordered from the a la carte menu and could still indulge in the buffet items. It was a very good way to start our days. Enjoyed meals in the Coral Room and Dalloway Terrace also. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2019,01,01
115,Exceptional Service,"Had a great stay here in this lovely hotel, I particularly loved the sitting room and The Coral Room where we had brilliant cocktails. The concierge was extremely helpful especially Brian at the door and recommended a nice restaurant before we went to the theatre. I thoroughly recommend it!",5,2018,12,31
115,"Hats off to the staff, yet again !!","Right time for the final stretch, drive to newcastle, credit also needs to be given to the staff at The Bloomsbury Hotel, who again have made my stay more than comfortable, treat like a king, they really do go the extra mile for there guests, a lot of people take things like this for granted and expect this, this is a different level from these guys, thank you again Bloomsbury staff, and Merry Christmas, i will see yous guys when I return in the new year.
Now home to see my children!!",5,2018,12,31
115,Lovely hotel not 100% ,"We staying here for a night as a treat while off to the opera and have to say you won’t be disappointed with the decor of the hotel or how grand it is, very 1920’s feel. The rooms are a very good size for London which we couldn’t fault however the reason we couldn’t give this 5 stars was due to the poor choice for gluten free. The burger wasn’t gluten free which means it wasn’t 100% beef which at £17 you would expect also the breakfast was very poor, the sausages were marked gluten free when they wasn’t (very dangerous) and the bacon was rolled in flour (why???) so that was out. We would love to return but only if the food choices improved. ",4,2018,12,31
115,Nice Hotel - great location,"I have stayed here with a friend for one night in November. 
We were in a twin room on the third floor. Room was really nice, warm and cozy and very clean. Even though our room was really close to the lift, I couldn't hear any noise whatsoever - and was really impressed with that. 
Staff were nice and helpful throughout whole hotel. 
Also, this hotel has an absolute brilliant location in London. I would highly recommend and would definitely stay again.",5,2018,12,31
115,Another faultless stay with my family,"Our annual visit to London with the children and my Mum and as usual The Bloomsbury has given us an amazing stay. It is definitely our favourite place in terms of the staff, location and everything it offers.",5,2018,12,30
115,romantic night in london,as always a lovely stay at this beautiful hotel. the new bar is fantastic with great cocktails and Brian the concierge was as helpful with advice and arrangements as could be wished for. I thoroughly recommend it.,5,2018,12,30

115,Christmas time,"I had a very nice Christmas with my family from the check in with Emmanuel, the walking tour with Janice to the check out with Than. Madalina was making sure our room was always clean and tidy every day. I really loved the atmosphere, the sitting room with the fireplace was very peaceful and relaxing. The location is just perfect near to Covent Garden, Oxford street, Soho and Leicester Square. I will definitely recommend this beautiful hotel to all my friends!

A big thank you to the staff for this enchantment.
I hope to see you soon..",5,2018,12,28
115,World class hotel and amazing service,We stayed at The Bloomsbury for 1 night celebrating my sister's graduation.  We stay at many 5 star hotels around the world and this has to be one of the best.  The hotel staff are all so friendly and welcoming and any request is dealt with so professionally.  The new Coral Room bar is absolutely stunning!  Such a luxe feel with an amazing cocktail list!  Dalloway Terrace is so cosy and again serving fantastic cocktails as well as amazing food.  The location is also a major plus - tucked away just behind Oxford Street.  I will never stay anywhere else when I am in London.  if I could give 6 stars I would!,5,2018,12,27
115,Great stay before flight the following dsy,"Amazing hotel in a really great location. Stayed before catching a flight from Stansted the next day and had a great time exploring London. The hotel was newly decorated and had lots of character and style, especially in the new bar area which had a great atmosphere for a few cocktails in the evening. The room was huge, well equipped and very nicely decorated. Great size en suite and extremely comfortable bed. Would highly recommend, the breakfast was great and the service brilliant throughout. Highly recommended",5,2018,12,27
115,Great friendly stay,"Great location, I barely used transports as everything is walking distance.

115,A very satisfying experience!,"My girlfriend and I spent a weekend in London to celebrate our 2nd anniversary together, and what A great choice I must say.

",5,2018,12,24
115,Small but perfectly formed ,We stayed in the Bloomsbury hotel just for one night to catch a Christmas show in London. From the moment we arrived the staff could not of been more helpful. Constantly checking if we needed anything and wishing us happy Christmas. Our room was on the seventh floor and although relatively small it had everything you could possibly need It was spotlessly clean and organised. The hotel has a really nice bar called the Coral room and we did dined in the Dalloway Terrace which was equally lovely. ,5,2018,12,24
115,An expreaince.,"I stayed here for one night during the busy Christmas season. Finding a good hotel in London can be difficult. I therefore booked this hotel thinking that I would have a comfortable stay. The room I booked was clean and spacious. The staff at the hotel were very nice. The man at the front desk who checked me in was very helpful and even made arrangements for me to take a taxi to the airport the next morning for my flight. Unfortunately, because it was the holiday season, there was a very loud and ruckus party going on just down the hall from my room. This made sleeping impossible and given that I had an early morning flight the next day I asked to be moved to another room. The night manager fully understood the issue and moved me to another room. I was very grateful that she accommodated me so that I could get a good night’s sleep.",4,2018,12,22
115,We have enjoyed the stay and will be returning again,"Stayed here with my wife for a short travel to London and did not regret the choice for the hotel. There was nothing more I could have wanted, contrary I was pleasantly surprised at how me and my wife were received and looked after during our stay. We both feel that this is the place to return again once we are in town.",5,2018,12,22
115,Stay was absolutely lovely ,"Fantastic interior design, professional staff, during the stay felt totally at ease with anything I needed. Loved the bar and live music at the Bar, has brought great vibe on our last day. Totally recommend!",5,2018,12,22

115,Favorite hotel in London,My husband and I stay at the Bloomsbury frequently when we are in London. Our last visit did not disappoint. The staff are friendly and always helpful. The hotel is beautifully decorated for the holidays. The rooms are always spotless and very comfortable. The afternoon tea is a treat and definitely worth making time for. I couldn’t recommend the Bloomsbury more!,5,2018,12,21
115,Amazing service and Beautiful rooms,The Staff here cannot do enough to help you. They truly made my trip to London Special and the hotel itself is second to none. From delicious meals to their amazing coral room offering an amazing drinking and dining experience. I would recommend to anyone to visit. You will not be disappointed.,5,2018,12,21
115,Good hotel,"Staid for two nights at a weekend. Excellent quality service. The rooms were a little on the small side, however that is reflected in the price. The place has been renovated recently and looks nice. Even spotted David Beckham in here! Would definitely go back... but would maybe try and find a bigger room next time.",5,2018,12,21
115,"Great stay, very helpful staff !","During our check-in we had the opportunity to meet Than who was very welcoming and filled us in on various topics like the local shopping, transport, entertainment.

115,BREAKFAST AT THE BLOOMSBURY,"Another hugely enjoyable stay at this jewel of a hotel; across the board, service is exemplary; rarely do West End hotels show the time and respect to speak with guests to this extent.  There is no better indication than the breakfast experience at the Bloomsbury.  Special thanks to manager Maria and her team: Estelita, Ionut, Victor and Dimitar who excel in customer service and friendliness.  So rewarding to witness that fine balance between high standards of technical efficiency and warmth of welcome.  Preparing fresh fruit for our journey home was especially considerate.  We wish all of the staff and management a very happy Christmas and prosperous New Year",5,2018,12,19
115,The Coral Room - Most beautiful bar/place for brunch in London,My favorite London hotel hands down. We stayed for my Mum's birthday and had a wonderful time. The Coral Room is BEAUTIFUL and perfect for a birthday brunch or cocktails. I couldn't stop taking photos of the beautiful decor. The Dalloway Terrace cocktail bar is also gorgeous and super romantic with all the fairy lights. As always they have the friendliest hotel staff always warm and welcoming. Highly recommend The Bloomsbury!,5,2018,12,18
115,Best hotel in London!,"From the first beginning we knew that it was a fantastic hotel. We met there a guy who is still working there called Emanuel, who is from Spain. He was very friendly and very kind to us. He told us many different to do during the weekend since me and my girlfriend didn´t plan anything to do. All the different restaurants that he mentioned were great and the tour he advised us was not the typical one. 

The hotel is perfectly located as you can go walking to the main spots. The room was very comfortable and the hotel has such a nice restaurant that we even had dinner the first time there (Emanuel recommended us and we don´t regret it at all!). You can go for some drinks since they have a wide range of options like margaritas, cocktails and good beer.

We recommend this hotel without hesitation.",5,2018,12,18
115,Wonderful stay,We had 3 nights stay with great time in Bloomsbury. Lobby is beautifully decorated with Asian Style and the room is clean and cozy.

The two new bar areas are lovely, with different atmospheres to appeal to all, the breakfast was excellent and to top it off, each and every member of staff was friendly and helpful. With the hotel being in a great location in central London, the stay ticked every box, exceeded expectations and I'd recommend without hesitation. 10/10.",5,2018,12,18
115,Drinks at this amazing hotel ,"I’d like to recommend this hotel. If you go for drinks or an afternoon tea, everyone will make you feel a star. I had the pleasure to meet the manager Sebastian who helped with my booking request and gave me lots of tips of places I should visit in Europe. The staff are very friendly and experienced in this hotel. ",5,2018,12,18
115,Bloomsbury hotel,"I have been at the Bloomsbury Hotel to visit my friend, for a couple of time.
We had some dinner ans tea and it was such a lovely experience.
The lobby is so beautiful, with this Asian decor, and the bar on rhe corner.
I also loved the Dalloway Terrace.
Would definitely recommend this hotel for my family and friends.",5,2018,12,18
115,Amazing Bloomsbury,"I have visited the Bloomsbury Hotel with my wife, for some tea.
Our experience was wonderful.
Everyone from the hotel team have made us feel very welcome, and it has been an unforgettable experience for us.
We had our tea (and a cocktail) by the fireplace, in the Sitting Room. This room is beautifully decorated, and very cozy and charming.
We look forward to coming back.",5,2018,12,18

115,Super Hotel and Location,Stayed last weekend for 2 nights to take in a show and some sight seeing. Hotel is excellent. Service is excellent especially Suzanna in reception and Zsa Zsa in the Terrace. Room was luxurious and comfortable. Bar at night has lovely atmosphere to chill and chat. ,5,2018,12,17

115,"Great hotel, average review because of a few key things","Staff are excellent, venue is nice. Bar claims to have lots of beverages, but only 2 types of beer - i think they are siloed into London beer company or something.Walls between rooms are paper thin, I kept getting woken up by various people on my floor walking quietly around their room. EVERY telephone conversation can be heard clearly through the walls!Shower in the room was terrible, flow of water was direct due to the small shower head and the temperature goes from freezing to scalding. Not a nice way to have a morning shower.Hotel was very clean.The elevator is really slow. Try not to get a room on the 8th floor, you'll spend most of your visit stood waiting for the elevator.Venue has good access to oxford street/regent street",3,2018,12,17
115,Great hotel -- but check your floor for active nights,"Very well maintained hotel, nice large rooms, well appointed.  The service and staff excellent, great food on premises, and centrally located.  What more could you want?  Be warned, however, that this place does seem to be a bit of a scene, there was several weddings or very loud celebrations during my stay.  I was unfortunately on a lower floor (second) and it the noise was quite loud, as were the cleanup noises early the following day.  I was quite tired from the previous day's activities and am a NYer, so the noise didn't bother me too much, but I could see it being disturbing for others.  The revelers ended up reveling in the hallway outside my door on a few occasions.  So if there's a party, make sure you're on a higher floor.  :-)",4,2018,12,17
115,Great Staff!,Stayed here for the weekend and it was a great stay. Especially the staff who made my anniversary a special one. Thanks guys!!. Definately worth the stay. Definately coming back here when in London again!,5,2018,12,16
115,"Excellent hotel, well located, fantastic service and friendly staff","I stayed with my fiance on Friday evening for one night to celebrate his PHD graduation. We were greeted by Than - Than was extremely helpful and friendly: he upgraded our room and treated us to a glass of sparkling wine each. We had cocktails in the Coral Room - highly recommend, great atmosphere and service. The next morning we had breakfast delivered to the room - excellent coffee, eggs royale and full english breakfast. Five stars - we will definitely be staying again and hope the hotel recognise Than's excellent customer service :)",5,2018,12,16
115,Wonderful experience,"Stayed here for a weekend. It was a beautiful hotel with extremely friendly and accommodating staff. Absolutely loved my stay here. Only marked down one because the breakfast was quite expensive, but it didn't seem like there was much of a selection. ",4,2018,12,16
115,Great location for a business trip,"I was in London for a work trip and stayed at the Bloomsbury, the location was perfect as its centrally located to so many things in the city and easy to get around. Staff was great and the hotel had a great restaurant and bar.",5,2018,12,14
115,London Christmas lights,"I will start by saying that this is a 5 star hotel. Awesome location, beautiful rooms, great bars and lounges - the restaurant is so popular you can’t get in. 
Unfortunately we had a bad experience with the front desk staff on arrival after a long haul overseas flight and it kind of left a bruise on our entire stay. 
That kind of thing is pretty inexcusable at this level of property. I let it go because we had many more hotels and cities waiting for us on this trip, but I kept getting emails from Doyle hotels to rate my experience, so I finally did. 
The immediate response from both the hotel mangers and Doyle hotels was impressive. Our last stay on this trip was at the Kensington (another Doyle property and our must stay whenever in London) and they were expecting us in the lobby and more than made up for our previous troubles at the Bloomsbury. Really incredible service with upgrades and treats. This company takes service seriously and I’m sure the issues we had have been addressed. 
I would recommend the Bloomsbury to anyone (as well as the Marylebone and the Kensington). 
Top tip - always get breakfast included at Doyle London hotels as it is a great value and perfect start to the day. You’ll not find a better meal and service in the morning. ",4,2018,12,14
115,Bloomsbury hotel London,"A perfect little gem hidden in a little side streets of London. A perfect venue to launch yourself into either the bustling shopping area or if you fancy Soho or Mayfair just a stones throw away. The hotel itself is a haven of small places to eat and drink both inside & out and all very tastefully done, a perfect place for friends to meet and greet or that ideal getaway with your partner and an amazing bar to boot. Be careful there are several hotels in the area. 16-22 Great russell Str.",5,2018,12,14
115,Fantastic Hotel and Great Bar to celebrate a 40th Birthday,"Chose the Bloomsbury Hotel due to convenience of a Central London location to meet a group of friends from around the the Greater London area. The hotel itself was spotless. We had a Deluxe King Room with some amazing touches for my wife's 40th celebration. The breakfast the next morning was a delight and lovely to see the charming team who took time out to have a conversation and ask about stay. Maria & Estelita are the best ever!

On the Saturday afternoon we had a few drinks in the Coral Room. There was a great buzz around and just a fantastic bar to unwind in and soak up the atmosphere.

We had reserved a space in the outdoor area of the Bloomsbury Club Bar which accommodated around 20 of us. Service here was amazing and Brian is a fantastic asset to the hotel. He ensured the team looked after us and the feedback from the party was exceptional and they will all now look to use the various bars in the future.

Check in/out was smooth and efficient with the usual helpful service from the concierge Paolo and Nalif.

Well done to all who helped to make the weekend so special and look forward to returning soon.",5,2018,12,14
115,Perfect birthday stay,"We spent a night at The Bloomsbury during a recent visit to London to celebrate our daughter's 10th birthday and had a fantastic experience. From the rooms, to the breakfast, the location and all the attentive staff, this is a wonderful hotel. The birthday welcome in our room was especially appreciated. A special thank you to Michael, Carlotta, Maria and all the team there for making our stay so special.

115,Dan Rodbourne,Great location and a great hotel. Full of staff that are helpful and provide a great service with a smile. The breakfast staff as always provided service with a smile. Jack in the Coral bar was brilliant in getting a table quickly and again provided a great service. ,5,2018,12,13
115,Perfect for us,"Our stay was for the purpose of a Theatre trip. We found the Bloomsbury through Mr and Mrs Smith. Reception was friendly and quick. We had a snack and drinks in the bar, before leaving to see the Tina musical. We booked a classic room which was very comfortable, clean and well equipped, with no view, which was not a problem as we we’re not tourists. ",5,2018,12,12
115,well situated,"Another nice weekend at The Bloomsbury in the heart of London.We stayed 2 nights and had a wonderful time.Check in went smoothly,while waiting for our room we had a light lunch in the bar area which was very nice.The room itself was OK.We didn't spend that much time in the room so everything was good enough,a nice bath,toiletries,towels etc,double bed,tv.
The Breakfast and the Breakfast staff were excellent[5 stars for them].Brian,the concierge is a different class,very knowledgable and informative.

Great location,handy for ALL needs,shopping,theatres,restaurants etc.",4,2018,12,12
115,Great family visit ,"Love this hotel. Stayed for business 12 Mts ago returned with family as location is excellent. We had two adjoining room which were great. They were spotless with super bathrooms. Breakfast was included and it is a must ... allow  at least an hour 😂 the hotel is walking distance from everything 30 mins at most ... 
The staff especially at breakfast are a credit to the hotel 
We will return ... thanks ",5,2018,12,11
115,Weekend Visit,"This hotel is a little gem, positioned for easy access to Oxford Street shops and Charlotte Street restaurants.
The recent refurbishment makes it feel fresh and inviting. Our room was not top of the range but comfortable enough for a two night stay. One downside was the bath/shower combination. All the water controls were at shower level so if you are having a bath you need to stand up to operate the water temperature etc. Rising from a sitting position was not easy for an old duffer like me because the only grab rail was at shower height and the bath had been let into the wall, thus giving no ledge to haul yourself up. My recommendation would be for one of the managers to try taking a bath to realise the problem and also issue a rubber anti-slip map to prevent slipping under water as I did.
The Coral Bar was excellent and all the staff were very friendly and efficient. We only had breakfast in the hotel which was of good quality and had varied self service selections.",4,2018,12,08
115,Welcoming reception and stay,"The hotel is perfect for a stay in London,  business , family or romantic .  Emanuel greeted us at reception and ensured a memorable stay for us at the hotel. The location suits shopping , dining and visits to local museums.  Breakfast is excellent.",5,2018,12,07
115,Perfectly accommodating Staff,"We visit this hotel regularly with work to do our events.  My favourite destination
Would like to give special mentions to Ionut and Maria and their wonderful team in the Bloomsburry Club - never keep us hanging around and so pleasant.  My special order of food was amazing!!! (Thank you)
James the hidden gem security guy who I’ve not met before ..... (hello) and thank you for helping us unload our equipment and organising everyone

Joel - that smile!!!! 
Love u all - thanks for an amazing year

115,"Nice clean , good location, small room & expensive - won't come again","Booked through lastminutehotels.com who had a 'smash hit' of a room for 'only' £355.
This turned out to be a very small room facing an alley behind the hotel full of dumpsters. Rather un-chique. 
The staff was friendly - at check in - and the room clean and well functioning enough.
The breakfast very nice but also not included in the rate and very expensive.
Check out took forever - much tapping of the key board ( I asked for two invoices - one for breakfast and one for the room which apparently was a  request warranting 7-8 minutes of uninterrupted tapping of the keyboard ) No eye contact - no ' How was your stay?' Just 'here you are!' at the end of the tapping. The trainee standing next to the 'experienced' agent checking me out looked surprised - as I was- at the lack of customer interaction exhibited.

I don't think I will go back to this hotel - all in all much better hotels with much better service at much lower rates all over London.",4,2018,12,06
115,Among the whispering and the Champagne and the stars...,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is a luxurious oasis, located mere steps from the melee of Oxford Street.  A place where nothing is too much trouble and it’s all too very easy to while away the hours, drinking expertly mixed cocktails in its superbly tended bars.  The Bloomsbury Club Bar in particular, evokes notions of a 1920’s Speakeasy, fused with a thoroughly modern, hipster jazz club.  Think The Great Gatsby meets Shoreditch.  Marvellous.",5,2018,12,05
115,Gorgeous boutique hotel in the heart of London with the most fantastic helpful and attentive staff,"Just got back from an overnight stay here with my husband. We were upgraded on arrival and our room was ready early for us. The room was beautiful with all amenities required. We had a gorgeous lunch in the Dalloway and can highly recommend it and the waiting staff, the restaurant is a little homage to Virginia Woolf and the historic Bloomsbury literary set, and little touches like the bill arriving inside a copy of Mrs Dalloway was quite lovely. All the staff throughout the hotel are incredibly friendly, helpful and amazingly attentive...little things like remembering our names and details of what we are doing, is such a lovely touch. This little gem of a hotel is located in the heart of the Bloomsbury district, just around the corner from the Tottenham Court Road tube station and is ideally located for the theatre district, Soho, Covent Garden etc! We will definitely return...Thank you to all at The Bloomsbury for making our stay a most fabulous one! ",5,2018,12,05
115,Fantastic Hotel,"We had a one night stay in December 2018 for my wife’s 50th birthday in order to see a West End show. It’s a very modern, classy hotel. Room and dining room all excellent with stunning bar areas.  Perfect location for the West End and all other popular tourist attractions and very close to the Tube. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend and we will definitely be going back.

115,Exceptionally well run hotel,"We stayed for 5 days and had a lovely time.  The rooms are comfortable and elegant, the Coral bar is beautiful, and the location for museums and theater couldn't be better.  But most of all, the staff were exceptional.  Pleasant, efficient, and they went the extra mile for us.  We will be back!",5,2018,12,01
115,Fabulous! Could not be better,"This hotel is amazing. Fantastic central location-ideal for shopping and theatre. Staff could not be more helpful. Comfortable well maintained rooms. Superb bar and cocktails. Breakfast great as well

115,Best hotel,Love this hotel! The cosy lounge with fire place is so relaxing. The room has everything you need and is spotlessly clean. Under floor heating in bathroom is lovely. Breakfast plentiful and good. Great location for the best of London. 5 stars for this place!,5,2018,11,29
115,Amazing hotel ,"Hotel is on great spot for visiting British museum and central London as everything is on walking distance. Very modern and clean rooms with beautiful design. Beautiful bar and good food in the restaurant but little bit pricey. Breakfast was very good with beautiful continental buffet and hot breakfast on order from menu. Top class ingredients. Very recommended hotel for visiting Soho,Oxford street and ect, all about 5 min walking ",5,2018,11,28
115,"Small rooms, no closet space, extremely loud noises preventing sleep.","I stayed on the 4th floor, room 410, and every single night starting at about 11pm and continuing until 7am workers across the street would be loading glass bottles into large metal bins. Yes, it's as loud as it sounds.

Other than the noise I actually really like this hotel. Rooms are very clean, staff very friendly, housekeeping does a great job keeping the rooms clean. My only criticism, other than the extremely loud glass breaking sounds every single night, is that there is no closet space or even wall hangers to hang your coat or store your luggage.",3,2018,11,28
115,Long weekend in London,"Stayed the weekend at The Bloomsbury and enjoyed every second.  The place has genuine high class.  Reception, bedroom, bar - all terrific as you would expect.  The best breakfasts we ever had - on the Dalloway Terrace, and in the breakfast room - particular big thanks to Dimitar, Victor, Marina, Maria and Beatrice who manage to combine cool efficiency with warm and genuine care.  What a grand way to start the day in London.  Needs to be on everyone's London Bucket List",5,2018,11,27
115,Long weekend with friends,"Six of us visited The Bloomsbury for a long weekend, to take in the England-Australia game.  The hotel is in a great location, is very clean and the majority of staff were very good.  We must say, all the staff in the Coral Room, we found excellent!!  The front of house, could have greeted us a little more “friendly”, although they were efficient.  Our main issue was that everywhere in the hotel, both bedrooms and public ares, were a little hot for our tastes, even having to drop the secondary glazing.  We would stay at this hotel when next in London, simply due to the location.",4,2018,11,27
115,Pleasantly surprised!,"We chose to stay at The Bloomsbury based on the recommendation from a friend who stays here whenever she travels to London for work. We’re glad we did!

The front of house staff were so accommodating with our requests. Ivan even had ginger tea sent to our room for my partner who was under the weather, while I went to the pharmacy to get some cold medicine.

The rooms were nicely appointed and included complimentary water that can be replenished upon request. Our room didn’t have a great view, but we didn’t stay there for the view. It was also steps away from the Tube, a Starbucks and a quaint little cafe that had inexpensive breakfast sandwiches. 

As someone who works in hotels, I was very impressed with the staff at The Bloomsbury. 

We look forward to returning!",5,2018,11,25
115,Awesome!!!,"Firstly, the hotel is in a fantastic location!

The property is clean and immaculately presented, and the staff are an absolute credit to their employers - nothing is too much trouble, and they are attentive without being over-bearing.

We only ate breakfast, however, if the rest of the culinary offerings are up to the same level then you're in for a treat. The bar is stunning and the cocktails are superb!

Highly recommended! :)",5,2018,11,25
115,24 hours is enough to fall for this place,"I stayed in the hotel for only one night, but it was enough for me to fall for it. You will have an excellent time. I would recommend the coral room cocktails and the second bar(on level -1 I think it was). Drinks were amazing and definitely worth it. Also, really helpful and friendly if you forget something in the room. It is very nicely decorated on the inside with all tables at the restaurant done so you can get your privacy with the other half.",5,2018,11,20
115,Chic boutique hotel with great bar,"As a New Yorker who appreciates a great hotel that simply gets it right, The Bloomsbury is now my London go-to hotel. It has everything a great hotel should: Instagram worthy breakfast patio, gorgeous hotel bar that draws an attractive local crowd but still feels comfortable for a solo drink, and nice enough albeit smallish hotel rooms. 

I also appreciated that the Coral Room was open during the day. It was a great spot to grab a couch and host an informal business meeting over coffee, which I took advantage of. 

Across the board the staff was on point and service is elegant. 

Location is amazing and walkable to soho in a few minutes. 

Open spaces are adorned with great art and unexpected combinations of antique mixed with modern furniture against daring wall treatments. Very much reminds me of The Crosby Hotel in Manhattan. 

Word of advice: If you are particular about a view or natural light, or need a large room, call the hotel to confirm which room types don’t face the interior courtyard (mine did, and it wasn’t great) and have extra space. I was solo and didn’t mind the small layout but with two people it would have felt cramped. ",5,2018,11,14
115,Fantastic Hotel,I stayed here with friends. Fantastic location close to all the amenities. We received a warm friendly reception from all the staff and nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were spotlessly clean and modern. We enjoyed cocktails in the newly refurbished bar which had a great vibe and buzz and it was nice to see a bar with some atmosphere. I will definitely be visiting again and thank you to all the stafff,5,2018,11,12
115,Management's clumsy redecoration destroyed this once grand hotel,"From the instance we arrived, I knew that this was a bad error to stay here.

1. The former grand entrance had been blocked off and turned into a yuppie bar, with pink walls and dubious paintings. Destroyed the formerly grand Georgian feel of the entrance.
2. We were directed to the tiny side entrance and at 2.25pm told that our room wasn't ready and to go into the parlour and tea/coffee would be served. After 2o mins wait and three conversations later, no drinks were forthcoming and had to trail back to reception to ask for a fourth time, at which point tea arrived, 30 mins after our arrival.
3. The decor, especially the pictures are dreadful. Whoever was in charge of the decor should be fired. Gauche, trendy and tasteless.
4. Beds tiny. When we booked, our booking said that we had booked a 'large double'. In my naivety, I had taken this to be a large double bed. It turned out to be a tiny queen bed, meaning we had a most uncomfortable night of fitful sleep.
5. Breakfast good
6. Staff all helpful and kind, but badly let down by a management who have ruined the design of a once charming hotel.
AVOID!",2,2018,11,12
115,The most Exceptional Service I have ever witnessed,"Upon leaving the taxi and service began. One of the friendly staff members saw me come out the taxi and immediately came and helped me with my bags. He was very friendly and polite (I never got his name but he was very lovely).Check-in I thought I was living in a fairytale. All the staff were so friendly, polite and had a solution-orientated, customer focused approach to everything. I've been to the hotel a few times and I think there's something on the system which notes this so they can track loyal customers. Anyway, Emanual made me feel very special upon check in and asked if I would like a complimentary bottle of wine and cheese platter to be sent to the room (Of course I said yes please) What a lovely surprise!  Breakfasts in the morning are always great. Maria is my fav <3. She has a wicked sense of humour, she always makes me smile and is great at remembering faces. The whole breakfast team, Maria, Estelita, Ionut, Victor and Dimitar work really hard, looking after the customers. I went to breakfast with a large group of colleagues where most of us order off the menu but them ask for some items to be removed and replaced with something else. We must be a nightmare to deal with (especially as one or two members of the group can be a little demanding). Luckily, the breakfast team are true professionals. No matter how the customer acts, they stay polite, attentive and helpful. I really admire that as it takes a lot of resilience.Thank you to the whole Bloomsbury team for another fantastic stay. ",5,2018,11,12
115,"lovely hotel, brilliant bar and service, but small rooms and expensive food!","I treated my boyfriend to a weekend away at this hotel for his 30th birthday in October!  The hotel itself is in a fantastic location which is one of the main reasons why I decided to book this hotel. 

When we arrived, we were greeted warmly at reception, and as I had mentioned it was my boyfriends 30th birthday when booking they told me they had given us a free upgrade which we weren't expecting at all and were really excited about! However our room wasn't ready when we arrived at the hotel, this wasn't a problem as we did arrive early and we wanted to go out for the day in London anyway so we left our bags and then decided to head to The Coral Room for a couple of drinks and a bit of brunch! The bar has such a buzzing atmosphere and we really did love it there we visited a couple of times during our stay. We sat at the bar and within minutes we were approached by an extremely friendly waiter who asked if we were being seen to, he then showed us to a lovely table and gave us some menus! A couple of minutes later he returned and took our order, we ordered two mimosas and two omelettes with truffle fries, our drinks came within a couple of minutes and our food arrived shortly after! Everything was delicious, we ordered another two mimosas then asked for the bill.... The bill was over £100 for two omelettes and four drinks, I know it's London prices, but that really was a shock! The next time we went to The Coral Bar we stuck to just having drinks haha! 

When we got back to the hotel after our day out we went straight to our room. I wasn't expecting a master suite or anything like that, but they had said at reception that they had upgraded us, I'm not sure what they'd upgraded us from but the room was very small and basic.. It was perfectly adequate with simple and modern decor, with a huge, extremely comfortable bed, a fully stocked mini bar (which obviously you'd have to pay for if you had anything from it), and a well lit small bathroom with a shower. As the room was so small I did think what would the room we had booked of been like if this was our upgrade? They had left a chocolate cake on the dressing table with happy birthday written on the plate which I thought was extremely thoughtful of them and we really appreciated it. 

We returned to The Coral Room again on the Sunday afternoon before catching our train home, and ordered a few G&T's which were delicious, they were around £12 each, you were also given complimentary olives and nuts whilst enjoying your drinks which were delicious and kept being replenished.. making me fat haha.

We didn't have dinner at this hotel or go to any of the other bars apart from The Coral Room so I cannot comment on these areas.

On the whole a brilliant weekend and stay at a hotel in a excellent location with such lovely staff! However the room was on the small side. I probably wouldn't stay again as I like to try new places anyway, but I will definitely be returning for some more drinks at The Coral Room at some point.. just not for an omelette haha.",4,2018,11,11
115,Really good hotel to stay,"I am regular at this hotel and its a really well run family hotel where you are made to feel most welcome. The new restaurant on the side of the building is done very well and is lovely to sit outside in the summer months. Inside the fireside room opposite reception is welcome haven for all those who love peace and quiet and a home from home experience.

For breakfast, I am impressed who the staff, Maria in particular, remembers your name despite the 1000's she must see and always makes you feel most welcome and nothing is too much trouble. The sausages served each morning are perfect too.

Our comments I would add to make it even better is that more power sockets are included in the bedrooms and there is a choice of shower gels and shampoo other than just lavender...its not to everyones liking. But these are minor things and easily rectified and didnt put off from my stay.",4,2018,11,11
115,"Small rooms, yet an exceptional experience","I really enjoyed my visit to London recently. While I generally just get a hotel to rest when traveling, The Bloomsbury Hotel stood out as one of the highlights of my trip. The room, while small, was impeccable and the service was exceptional. I particularly enjoyed my chat with Susanna in the hotel and with Jack in the bar. I have to admit that I also looked forward to the different treats that were left in my room every day :)",5,2018,11,11
115,This is a lovely hotel,Since our last visit just over a year ago the downstairs has been completely changed with the bar where reception used to be. We had a room that has been recently renovated but was right by the lift so kept us awake both nights unfortunately. Should have installed new lifts when renovations were carried out they are extremely slow and any one and get in them without a key to reach any floor and therefore the bedrooms. Service is excellent and we do like this hotel so will use again.  ,4,2018,11,11
115,Yet another fabulous stay in this fantastic  boutique hotel ,"Our second trip this year to this fabulous boutique hotel and yet again the fantastic staff along with Sebastian Annandale pulled out all the stops THIS IS A MUST VISIT HOTEL such a great base in London not far from Tottenham court road tube station so well in walking distance of the main attractions also while you visit here the coral lounge along with the down stairs bar which both bars have live music such a nice atmosphere we have been coming here  for over 7 years now and gets better and better every time we visit just want to say thank you again for a fabulous,stay and to mention some of the staff here Sebastian the barman ionut and Mariana the breakfast staff also the food at breakfast is lovely all freshly cooked a must visit hotel that is in a great location .Thanks again to Sebastian Annandale and his fabulous staff back again in 2019😁😁

115,A First Class Hotel,"I visited the Bloomsbury hotel expecting the condition, rooms, food etc to be excellent and indeed the hotel met my high expectations. However what exceeded my expectations was the level of service and friendliness from the staff which really was first class. Not only were all the staff efficient and professional, but they used my name, especially during breakfast. This level of attention to detail is unusual by todays standards and is certainly a credit to the hotel and management. Thank you, I will definitely return.",5,2018,11,09

115,A fabulous hotel in an excellent location,"The hotel is beautiful and caters for all with it's restaurants and cocktail bar. The staff are very helpful and courteous and the rooms have everything you need including a very comfortable bed.

It's in a great location so we were able to walk everywhere.",5,2018,11,06
115,beyond expectation,"We loved our stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel.
Specially the Dalloway restaurant... Food was delicious, and the decoration is very pretty, with all those flowers hanging from the wall.
It's very cosy.
Fabio's service was spotless. He went through the menu with us, and recommended a great wine.
Our check-in was with Chringa (not sure the correct spelling), and Sebastian.
They've made us feel welcome, and offered assistance with the luggage, wake up call, etc. A very warm welcome.
Our room was very cozy, just a bit noisy in morning.
Breakfast was delicious.
Maria and Luminita were great, and remembered our preferences of coffee and hot food.
We are planning to celebrate our anniversary there too.",5,2018,11,05
115,"A warm, friendly hotel ","My husband and I had a wonderful, overnight stay at this welcoming hotel, ideally situated near to Oxford Street. The bedroom was nicely decorated with a well stocked mini bar and all those little extras like home-made biscuits and chocolates. Breakfast was served to us by the delightful waiter, Ionut and we were made welcome by Miss Maria. All in all a most delightful stay and I would recommend it for the fuss all the staff make of you. ",5,2018,11,04
115,Warm place conveniently located,"From outside, this hotel looks like a cold cube, slightly off of the main roads.  However, already on the stairs to the reception you feel this is not going to be yet another hotel!  From the entrance on, you are treated like a VIP and everything is done to make you stay enjoyable.  The room is very comfortable, in particular the heat from the floor in the bathroom. The breakfast is also great.",5,2018,11,03
115,Lovely hotel with lovely people and at lovely location ,"This place is situated in a place so easily accessible and close to oxford street . When you take a big bus do make it a point to ask them so they drop you near the street as you can walk back to hotel 

About Bloomsbury words can’t describe they have such a lovely staff who are so courteous. Right from the gate to reception and the restaurant and the breakfast place . 

Special mention on THAN MIN who greeted us and made it so comfortable and touching was when we were going out he saw us walking and offered a umbrella which was so helpful or we would have got wet at London tower . It’s so thoughtful 

At the breakfast when you start your day the staff Maria , estilica and mariana and all the other staff take so much care of asking is all fine on this table and they make your day by remembering you by name . So sweet of them . 

The bar serves lovely cocktails don’t miss them 

I would love to come back to stay with you all 

Happy business and happy Christmas 

",5,2018,11,02
115,"Impeccably lovely, a great place to stay","This is absoltuely a semi-hidden gem. The room I stayed in was large, beautiful, and had everything I could possibly dream of wanting in a hotel, right down to tiny details that made me wonder if you had read my mind. The housekeeping was utterly impeccable. 

In terms of surroundings, the entire hotel is gorgeously designed and utterly welcoming. In particular, the Coral Room is gorgeous and buzzing in the evenings. Staff could not be more friendly and helpful all around.

I had business nearby, but I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again wherever I needed to be. It’s an added plus that it’s a stone’s throw from the British Museum and other points of interest, not the least of which is Cornelissen across the street — an extra bonus for artists!

On a very personal note, my room was upgraded the moment I walked in from a long journey and I never ceased to be grateful — the beauty and comfort it offered made me smile every day I stayed. Thank you very much for this — I appreciated it as much as a traveler could!",5,2018,11,02
115,We never left home!,"My wife and I stayed on this hotel last Oct. 14 and came back two weeks later, Oct. 27-29. What an experience we had ... as if we never left home! At the breakfast room, we were greeted each morning with friendly smiles from staff lead by Maria, who treat us like family. Special thanks to Estelita, Ionut, Victor, Luminita and Dimitar, who would often come at our table to ask if we needed anything more. We were amazed as they greeted each visitors with our names... a great way to start the day. Their concierge - Ivan, Dale, Brian  Naleef, were all very helpful and friendly. Same can be said to Emmanuel at the Reception, JC and Zain (GRM) and Than & Sebastian... I have to personally asked for their names because this is the only way I could thank all of them for taking good care of us while we where there... Great location, too. Watched the ""Bat out of Hell"" at Dominion Theatre which is a few steps away. We have shared our experience with our friends and will book there, too.  For us, we will surely be back, because we found a new home and a new family at Bloomsbury!",5,2018,11,01
115,Awesome Experience,"Great staff, great location and just an overall great hotel/experience - highly recommended!  The Living Room is one of my favorite parts of the hotel plus the coral room has some of the best cocktails/uniquely designed for your stay - great relaxing atmosphere too!",5,2018,10,31
115,Most friendly staff!,"We visit the Bloomsbury two to three times a year. By now we know the staff and they know us. They make us welcome every time. Joe in the bar and Maria in the breakfast room are two of the very friendly staff who treat us in the most kindly way.
The rooms are spaces and very comfortable and the bar is worth to visit even you do not stay in the hotel. Overall we certainly come back.",5,2018,10,31
115,Perfect!,"We have just returned from our 5th visit to the Bloomsbury.  Beautiful hotel in a perfect location and with the most amazing staff.  Special thanks to Victor, Ionut , Estelita and Luminita who looked after us so well at breakfast and also all the staff in the fabulous Coral Room.  We will be back.",5,2018,10,29
115,An excellent visit.,"We have just returned from our 4th visit to The Bloomsbury.  On arrival we were delighted to be given an upgrade to a very spacious and stylish suite.  The staff were, as always friendly and efficient and I would particularly like to thank the charming Than and the helpful and hardworking Ivan.  We also enjoyed our cocktails in the Coral Room. We look forward to returning.",5,2018,10,29
115,Amazing gem,"Spent weekend for anniversary. Staff were incredible, so helpful and polite. Room was very nicely decorated. Restaurant was amazing as was staff and food.  We enjoyed the Coral Bar which had live jazz trio - a real treat all around. It’s an unexpected find in central London",5,2018,10,29
115,Nice mix of old grandeur and new hotel for a really good price,"I was really in a bind as I needed a room on short notice and the Bloomsbury seemed to be the only one available. My stay was very short, so I didn't have the time to use some of the hotel's amenities or eat in the restaurants. But I enjoyed the stay all the same.

It feels like an old hotel, and all the good and the bad that comes with it. The carpet was worn, and in some places torn, and you sort of felt like you were staying over at Grandma's house. On the other hand, it felt comfy and familiar... as if you were staying over at Grandma's house.

Even with the classic feeling, there was enough modern and up to date to make the stay productive for a business traveler. The bed was a highlight, the bathroom fully functional (although I prefer a stall shower, not showering in a tub... Grandma's House). There were plenty of electrical outlets with built in adapters for other countries' plugs and usb plugs. 

The staff at the desk was up to standard, and the breakfast quite nice. A serious army of staff ready to help.

I would visit again.",4,2018,10,29
115,Not quite five star,"Awww I struggled with my feedback on the Bloomsbury. We always travel to London for our anniversary and like to stay somewhere a bit quirky - loved Hazlitts last year.

The Bloomsbury seemed to tick all the boxes. Its an awesome location- right in the West End but in a quiet side street. The decor and ambiance is glorious. It feels special and welcoming. Open fires, arty bohemian style. Lovely staff.  

However there were just a couple of cock-ups that tarnished our stay. We want things to be perfect when we only have a couple of days for that special celebration. 

Firstly we checked in early and as expected the room wasn't ready. Came back at 4.30 and were told the room was gorgeous and the luggage was there. We were,t shown to the room though which I thought was unusual but no matter. Anyway the room had a third child's bed made up. A big box of macaroons on the bed and a lovely card addressed to someone else. Rang down and then were in limbo for several minutes not knowing if we should stay in the room or return to reception. We got to our room later - and the hotel had placed a lovely anniversary cake and a couple of cocktail vouchers i the room- so well recovered and a nice touch. 

Second day we got back to hotel at 4-tired from shopping and keen for a quick pre theatre cat nap. And the room wasn't made up.

Again nicely handled. We were offered drinks whilst we waited for housekeeping. But actually we just wanted the room.

 I'm sorry to sound a little negative about such a charming place that works hard to offer customer service but it just needs to sharpen up at busy periods",4,2018,10,29
115,Good service and friendly staff,"We came to London for shopping and Premier League football with my son. We needed good hotel and excellent location near everything. Bloomsbury hotel was our choice. It was so easy to walk along Oxford st., short distance to Soho butiques, less than ten minutes walk to Charollette St restsurants etc,. Coral Room cocktail bar was excellent for a drink before and after dinner. Trendy good looking people and superior bar tenders. Thanx for the show and best for the guy who makes over thousand drinks per day. Overall hotel is nice, clean, warm, well decorated and worked out well for our purpose. Breakfast was tasty and was served by friendly staff. Soecial thx to: Estelita&Maria, Marina, Luminita, Fonut, Victor and Dnaitar. Only minus on our hotel visit was dinner teracce chill feeling. It was only +5c outdoor temperature and those plastic curtain doors and infrared heaters does not make this place warm indoor feeling dinner experience. Food was ok but dont taste that well if you feel little bit cold after walking whole day in chilly London weather. Just visit this hotel  and make your own excellent London weekend.",5,2018,10,28
115,WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY HOTEL,"We recently stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel in London and I must say we were very impressed.  Upon arrival, we were a little skeptical because we realized that our travel agent  booked us in a boutique hotel,  We are  accostumed  to staying at  high-end hotel chains so at first we were a little disappointed,  Boy did our opinion change fast.  Not only was the location excellent, the hotel was lovely and the staff was exceptional.  Ivan, the concierge was absolutely the best.  He went above and beyond during our whole stay.  He did everything he could to make our stay a fabulous one.  Not only was Ivan extraordinary, but every employee we encountered at the Bloomsbury was exceptional, especially the following:
Dale-concierge-he was vey helpful with all our tour planning needs when Ivan was off duty.
Sebastian-Senior Guest Relationship Manager was very helpful
Brian Murphy- Head Concierge-made sure we were always taken care of.
The breakfast staff which included Maria who always had a smile on her face and never forgot anyone’s name.  Ionut-our waiter who went above and beyond serving us a delicious breakfast every morning. Victor,Estelita, and Dimitar made sure we had everything we needed.
The Coral Room staff was also unbelievable.  The restaurant Manager, David Andrews was always there to help us.  Giovanni couldn’t do enough for us,  Rowfin was a great attentive waiter. Gabrielle was the best.  All the staff we encountered made us feel at home and this is the reason why, when we return to London, we will definitely stay at The Bloomsbury.  Why stay anywhere else when you can stay at the best!!!  Thank you to all the staff for an exceptional experience.",5,2018,10,27
115,Warmth and Hospitality ,"The Bloomsbury hits it out of the park if you care about the warmth of the staff and lovely surroundings. I just stayed almost three weeks here for business and every single person made me feel like they were glad I was there and did their utmost to make us comfortable. The hotel is over a hundred years old and the owners keep making it prettier, contemporary with class, and more fun with major upgrades. Sébastien the hotel manager is the epitome of hospitality professionalism. The housekeeping staff are meticulous. The dining room staff (worth calling out individually) Maria, Eskalita, Manna, Víctor, Luminita & Dimita thank you for making me feel like I was just stumbling downstairs to my own breakfast table!  The often instagrammed Dalloway Terrace was perfect for client lunches. The two hotel bars and the sitting room gave us plenty of spots for cocktails or a quiet conversation. Thank you Paul in the Coral Room for your drinks suggestions. We photographed part of the cocktail menu to try to recreate our favorites at home. Loved the Cuban theme pop up bar from NYC in the Club Bar. Honestly everything you need or want is here! As this place never rests on its laurels I’m sure a spa and pool will be in its future :)",5,2018,10,27
115,1 night stop,Wanted a convenient West End hotel for theatre visit. Bloomsbury works well. It's location sort of nestled behind the through roads is ideal. The room was clean and a reasonable size. Ate on the Dalloway Terrace (excellent - reviewed elsewhere) and late cocktails in The Coral Room adter theatre. What stuck out was the friendliness and efficiency of the staff. Will now be my first choice for future theatre jollies.,5,2018,10,25
115,Better than BEST!,"When we arrived in August for a one week stay at the hotel, Ivan saw that our Queen bed room was not satisfactory for 7 nights. With his help & that of the front desk, we ended up with a marvelous King bed in a superior room, worth every additional charge. 

The amenities, decor and location of the Bloomsbury were fantastic. It seemed that every employee was determined to make our visit to London a comfortable success. The efficient service provided by Maria, who welcomed us by name each morning, and her breakfast room staff always started our day with warmth. Ivan was the most conscientious and caring doorman. His smile definitely brightened the hotel lobby! 

There are many fine hotels in London but The Bloomsbury Hotel is the one we'll return to!",5,2018,10,24
115,Lovely Hotel in great position,"We had a number of events in London last Saturday and decided to stay at the Bloomsbury for the convenience. It was our fist time at this hotel and definitely will use it again.
While we found the Superior Room smaller than we had expected the comfort and room amenities were good.
The breakfast was superb and so was the service here. We must acknowledge the attentiveness of Estelita and my wife compliments Chef Robert for the perfect poached eggs.
We did have time on Sunday to enjoy a coffee in the art deco bar which we found charming.",4,2018,10,24
115,Corral wedding anniversary,"I pushed the boat out for a special occasion, our coral wedding anniversary. The Bloomsbury Hotel has a Coral room where you can get cocktails and we both like visiting London. We had welcoming chocolates and the staff laid on something special.the cocktail waiter was very friendly and gave us some tasters which were very good. The food was very good a well. I have to say all the staff were very professional and couldn't be faultedfaulted, they all seemed to enjoy doing there best for you and always with a smile.",5,2018,10,24
115,Outstanding services,"I have been for drinks at the Bloomsbury Club Bar, with some friends.
The atmosphere is amazing, they have live music, a great space outside and a very romantic and classic ambient inside.
We tried their signature cocktail and some international classics.
Service was great.
We also saw the hotel reception and the Coral Bar, and we are planning to try it soon.
George and Sebastian (barmen) were great!!",5,2018,10,23
115,Calm oasis...,"This is a really characterful hotel with a fascinating history...

They provide a full booklet in the room.

It is blissfully quiet and yet complete central...

Good dinning rooms and bars...

Very friendly welcoming staff...

Immaculately clean and well run.

Good value too...

Highly recommended ",5,2018,10,23
115,Character hotel that can't be beat!,"My sister highly recommended this hotel and I was not disappointed!!  The décor is unbelievable--fashionable, cool, unique, the service is excellent --thank you Ivan and Paolo, and the location superb--away from crazy crowds yet close enough to walk to most sites.  If you are staying there, don't miss the Seamus Heaney Library on 1st floor.  The hotel bar/restaurant, The Coral Room, is lovely!!",5,2018,10,22
115,Birthday Getaway,"We booked into the Bloomsbury for an early birthday treat from my Husband. We arrived early due to having tickets for Aladdin which started at 2:30pm, we knew early check in wasn't guaranteed, our room wasn't ready so they checked in our bags & we enjoyed a drink in the bar.

The hotel decor is stunning, so many little touches, with multiple bars to drink in, they are all so different it was wonderful to explore.

When we came back, we went to our room to find our bags & a Happy Birthday message & a slice of cake, which was a lovely thoughtful touch.

Our room was wonderful, it was a lovely size, bed was very comfortable. Breakfast offered a wide range of options. All staff were kind & very helpful, they all made you feel very special. I feel like we have found a wonderful gem of a hotel & we will definitely be booking again & would recommend to anyone in a heart beat.",5,2018,10,22
115,Brilliant long weekend away,"We were upgraded on our arrival to a suite which was an amazing room, highly impressed and a really nice touch by the hotel. The rooms and service are outstanding, and the bar near the reception (not the one downstairs as we didn't visit) was amazing, the cocktails were to die for! One of the bar staff remembered what a guy drank who last visited a month ago, pretty impressive attention to detail by them all. We won't be staying anywhere else next time we visit London",5,2018,10,21
115,What an amazing stay! Made feel so very special!,"We stayed for few days, totally blown away by the service, ambience and wonderful hosts. We were greeted by amazing Than Min who showed us around, made us feel like at home, so comfortable!  A stay to remember! The bar was totally charming, great life music, fantastic choice of wine and food. Totally amazing stay! Thank you so much, definitely will be coming back! ",5,2018,10,21
115,Five days in London,"we stayed five days at the Bloomsbury in September 2018, which is well located easily access the underground.  The staff is very welcoming, engerentic and very polite.
there are three areas where one can get an adult beverage and a meal, very convenient.
the rooms are very comfortable and clean.  the included breakfast in the mornings  were great wholesome and adequate.
we highly recommend the Bloomsbury",5,2018,10,21
115,Perfect location and ambiance for my stay,"As always we were very comfortable at The Bloomsbury. The renovations, especially the Coral Room were exceptional. We had a wonderful, relaxing time very much due to the excellent individuals in the Breakfast area who greeted us warmly each morning and remembered us from our previous stays. Maria-Esdita Luminata was, as always, welcoming and solicitous of us; Victor, Ionut, Bella and Simon took care of us each day as if we were special. We can;t wait to go back next year.",5,2018,10,20
115,Still my home away from home in London,"This is my favourite hotel in London. Wonderful staff, who truly do make me feel at home, many who also remember my name. I’ve stayed in various ‘classes’ of rooms there. All are extremely comfortable with quality furnishings and bathrooms accessories and toiletries. Having a coffee pod machine in all rooms almost saves my life, as I’m a very early riser! It has a number of restaurants and bars, and I suggest booking in advance as they are all popular. This time I held a business meeting over afternoon tea, in the Coral room. Excellent quality and presentation with a handsome take away box for my colleague to take home the sweet treats we didn’t eat! Thanks as always to all staff.",5,2018,10,20
115,Disappointing renovation,"I’ve been going to this incredible hotel for years  , excellent service , good rooms , well sized.Wonderful breakfast, but SOMEBODY managing the Doyle Hotels thought a bar for drinks at the entrance of a Palace like THE BLOOMSBURY would give us , guests ,the reception we should have as welcome to a 4 star!Instead round the corner by a side Street we have a dump entrance with a couple of gentle clerks with the presentación of an old bed and breakfast ! Very unfortunate taste!",3,2018,10,19
115,Hotel was perfect,"I recently stayed at The Bloomsbury when on a holiday with my mum. The hotel was amazing, offering a range of services. Special thanks to Maria and the team during breakfast service. The choice of bars to have an evening drink was great, especially the complimentary platter and drink invite that was given. The location can’t be faulted and we were able to walk into Soho, Covent Garden, shop on Oxford Street and many more. We will definitely be back when returning to London. Staying at a small hotel in the heart of London made the trip memorable.",5,2018,10,18
115,Lovely hotel and great location!,"We visited The Bloomsbury for 1 night in October and it is a lovely hotel in a great location. We first had a queen deluxe room which was a little on the small side. Unfortunately our shower was broken which we only realised an hour before we were due to watch a show and the staff were unable to do anything about it until we had got back later that evening; they then upgraded us to a much bigger room which I think was the king deluxe. We had a two course lunch in Dalloway terrace which was beautiful. The coral room is also a stunning place to drink a cocktail or two, however there is a mandatory service charge so just be aware. Breakfast in the morning was also lovely, we had a cooked breakfast and pancakes which were cooked beautifully. Overall a lovely stay, we would return! ",4,2018,10,16
115,"Amazing Hotel, Amazing Staff!","This hotel is an absolute Gem! The Service here is amazing and the staff are so friendly and accomadating. I've always love to stay here and always come back because there is no other Hotel in town that offer the same level of service. The location is central and easy to get around with the station literally a minute away. The breakfast team here are also amazing they will always go the extra mile to make sure I am confortable and the breakfast is freshly cooked and delicious! Special thanks to Maria,Victor, Marina and the rest of the breakfast team. I would reccomend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a comfortable stay with exceptional service! :)",5,2018,10,16
115,THE BLOOMSBURY - SPECTACULAR  - A MUST STAY !!!!,"Aside from being a beautiful establishment, having comfortable accommodations, delicious food, and brilliant cocktails ... THE STAFF WAS NOTHING SHORT OF EXCEPTIONAL . 

Let’s start with the manager, Sebastian - i came to London with my mother for my birthday, upon arriving we were given our room, and noticed we didn’t not have a King bed as promised by our travel agent. We contacted the front desk (Alma who was also so kind and helpful) who then contacted the manager and BAM - just like that we were upgraded and the issue at hand was fixed. They also gave us 6 free drinks for the Coral room due to the confusion ! How kind! They also sent up a BEAUTIFUL bouquet of flowers and cake for my Birthday !!! A pleasant surprise for sure ! 

Pavel (spelling?!) the concierge was so attentive and thoughtful!! My mom left her phone in the transfer from LHR to the hotel. He did everything he could to get her phone back including assuring us the drivers in London wouldn’t think to steal something like that, which put my moms heart and mind at ease for a few moments. He checked in frequently wth us to make sure all was alright ... The phone ended up being returned! 

Gabriele, Stephan, Samir, Diego, Paul, and Jack- (clearly i spent a lot of time at the bar) the staff at the coral room honestly so attentive! Each and every one of them take such care and pride in their work. They were definitely carefully selected .. i normally NEVER hang out in the hotel i am staying at (much to convienent for my liking) but the staff and atmosphere at this lounge were so inviting that i found my self there 4 times during my trip ! Each time I had an positive experience, conversed with the staff on a PERSONAL level, and stayed until they had to kick me out lol i really can’t express how appreciative i am of how special they made me feel while i was there ! 

Room Service - unfortunately i do not know the names of those who help behind the scenes - but let’s just say my mother and i can be quite difficult when it comes to ordering food :) they took their time in taking our orders, never with attitude, and the food always came in a timely manor, and of course delicious ! Thank you ! 

So yes, my stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel was PERFECT . Thank you for making my trip spectacular!!",5,2018,10,15
115,The best hotel in London by a century mile!,The service I get here is awesome and super attentive. I have never had a bad experience here due to the extra care they have given me over the many times I have visited. The added little touches which they do shows why this is an amazing place to stay for tourists and business people. The location is super and the breakfast team are dedicated to giving the best quality I have ever seen! Thoroughly enjoy this hotel every time I stay here and will always recommend to anyone that wants luxuary and the extra mil3e of care.,5,2018,10,12
115,thank you for the most wonderful weekend,"Myself and my wife have visited The Bloomsbury three times now and after each visit we mean to write a review but always forget.  However, I really want to share this hotel with everyone and also thank the wonderful hotel for our fantastic weekend.   It was my wife's birthday and when I booked I mentioned this.  We checked in and were told we were upgraded because it was a special occasion.   Our room was really beautiful.  Big super king bed with beautiful bed linen and fab pillows.  
Our bathroom was marble from floor to ceiling with a massive bathtub.
They have a stunning cocktail bar where we went to start off our celebrations.   it was amazing with super friendly staff. 
Breakfast is amazing, such an array of gorgeous food with a great choice and options for everyone including our vegetarian daughter who joined us.  Maria,I think was the name of the lady in charge who welcomed us each morning by name and with a lovely warm smile .
I couldn't recommend this hotel any higher, I would give it 10 stars if that was possible.
Thank you so much for a wonderful weekend.  we will be back soon  ",5,2018,10,10
115,Excellent vacation,"We were at The Bloomsbury Hotel at 18-23 July 2018
The location is excellent, you can shop all day at Oxford str and the hotel locate near by.
The service was great, I want to mention Marina, Kingo, Estelita, Ioneet from the dining room. They were give great service and were polite.
The rooms are in high level' have all the facilites you need.
Staying in The Bloomsbury Hotel ypu fell like you at home",5,2018,10,10
115,Adding to an earlier review,"In an earlier review I failed to mention 4 particular employees who hands down provided the best service all around of anywhere I have traveled.  All of the staff was wonderful and commends kudos but we would like to say a sincere thank you from my daughter who is studying abroad there and her mom (me) back in the States.  To Joel, who promised to keep a fathers protective watchful eye while she is away and a wonderful place for her to have morning coffee, your sincerity, attentive service and kindness was much appreciated.  To Ivan whose first radiant smile greeted us at the entrance and made sure we were comfortable and happy for our stay,  your gentle demeanor and incredible competence should take you far with the Doyle group.  You were charming, always a gentleman and always there to assist. To Emmanuel and Naomi, you went out of your way to make this a special week for us.   I’ll be back for a couple of days again the end of the month and sincerely look forward to not only enjoying the fabulous accommodations, but to see the staff again.  It is my favorite hotel ever  and favorite Doyle property and the staff is the reason.  Kudos! ",5,2018,10,04
115,Cocktails in the Coral Room ,Husband and I had a very enjoyable stay at The Bloomsbury which is in a great location.  Spent the majority of a rainy Sunday afternoon in The Coral Room - delicious food and cocktails!  Our room was cosy and comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful.  Will definitely stay again.  ,5,2018,10,04
115,Vocation,"Very good hotel. Big and beautiful room. All you need is there.  Excellent breakfast.   Sweet pub at the hotel for night pleasure.  Very welcome service     Great location close to every thing and the tube.  Lots of restaurants and shopping at the 
area 
Hope to be back",5,2018,10,03
115,Amazing People!,"Staff are very nice especially Estelita, Maria, Victor , Diego, Simon and Ivan. Nice service . Good food, nice location. Staff are very attentive. Breakfast food so good! Love the bacon! I will recommend the steak for food room service ,",5,2018,10,02
115,good location,"Beautiful hotel, nice room, comfortable beds, lovely toiletries.  Good location.
Some younger front desk employees could have been more courteous and professional. 
It seems the hotel wants to attract Instagram selfie-taker types. It felt like one front desk employee was more welcoming to a young couple in their 30s, than they were to this very jetlagged middle- aged traveller, at check in.

I found the music in the Coral Room and the bar too loud in the evening. The food in the Bar is quite good, but the server was very slow.",4,2018,10,02
115,Wonderful stay,"Enjoyed a great weekend stay,everything is first class including the location.
The breakfast is great,as is the breakfast team especially Maria.
Just don't leave without tasting a midtown swizzle cocktail in the Coral Room.",5,2018,09,30
115,Five days in London,the staff at the Bloomsbury are the best....we could choose to stay in and eat at one of three venues in the hotel or walk a short distance to numerous dinning locationsthe hotel is centrally located easy access to the Metro and bus line.,5,2018,09,29
115,great hotel and location,"from the first moment we entered the hotel through the check in and the all stay.. every one is so polite, so much smilimg and helpfull.. it is our second visit here this year..... the room is very clean (twice a day cleaning..) the bed was very comfortable. even though rooms are not too big (it is LONDON don't forget..) it is very good value for the money. and the location on the Oxxford street is superb !!",5,2018,09,28
115,Excellent hotel,"Had a lovely weekend staying at the Bloomsbury. Service and staff were exceptional. Nothing was too much trouble. Would rate it 5 star. Little attention to details including very large fluffy white towels and proper pots of tea and coffee at breakfast, instead of stupid push button machines.  Room was large and very clean. Breakfast excellent with plenty of choice. Location excellent close to Oxford Street and Covent Garden. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to family and friends and hope to return in the future.",5,2018,09,26
115,Stylish and Elegant Hotel with a great neighborhood feel,"Very professional service from the minute we arrived until the time we left. Concierge was very helpful securing theater tickets, maps etc.  Rooms were immaculate, beds comfortable, proper bar set-up, and plentiful breakfast to start your day.  Easy walk to the Underground, Museums, Theaters, Restaurants, Convent Market, etc.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,09,25
115,Very Professional,"I was working there last Saturday on an event. Very polite staff and obviously in a league of its own. I was very impressed both by the standard of the rooms and exceedingly helpful staff.
My only concern is that if you are working on an event within the George V suite the ‘get in’ is not friendly. No lift for kit only a few stairs situated on a narrow street which is only found by driving around a one way system.  NOT VAN friendly.
If you want parking the carpark opposite which is not hotel parking is very very very tight be warned the under ground car park is not for big cars and was £45 for 24 hrs. Forget parking a van here.

Do not let this detract that the Bloomsbury hotel is a great Hotel with a great vibe and great staff!!!!!",5,2018,09,25
115,Fabulous Hotel,"We booked a one night stay at the Bloomsbury as we were going to be in the city overnight. We had stayed at the sister hotel, the Marylebone Hotel before. We loved the Bloomsbury, the hotel has a fab elegant feel about it...staff were great always friendly and polite. Our room on the 6th floor was small (Classic) but very comfy, bathroom was excellent too. We did have to have air con during the night as the room was very warm as was the rest of the hotel. The Coral bar was fabulous and we loved it. But later in the evening we took our drinks to a sitting room where we sat in front of the fire and relaxed in peace and quiet. There was a live band in the bar which we thought was a bit loud. Breakfast the following morning was super...in fact the continental breakfast was the best we have ever seen. If we went back I would stick with that option instead of the cooked breakfast.

Getting in and out of the hotel by car (we parked nearby) was a challenge even with satnav but having said that most people would not drive into the city. We loved the hotela and would highly recommend it.",5,2018,09,25
115,Brilliant Bloomsbury!,"A truly exceptional hotel in a great location. In the heart of London but peacefully quiet at night. Third occasion staying and a home from home experience, but much grander! All staff welcoming and highly efficient, they should all be proud of the work they do. Special thankyou to Sebastian and Camille for enriching a wonderful time.",5,2018,09,25
115,Outstanding Accommodation with Exceptional Service,"The Bloomsbury London was exceptional! Having stayed there twice in the last month, I was very pleasantly surprised by the facilities of the hotel coupled with the exceptional service. David Andrews, Restaurant Manager provided exceptional service, the menu's were fantastic and service was outstanding. Highly recommended and will return again!",5,2018,09,25
115,Customer service at his best,"Having stayed at many top class hotels, I had felt that customer service wasn't always of prime importance. The Bloomsbury has restored my faith & I will only stay here when in London.
I asked to change room as this trip was a birthday gift to myself, Sebastian Annandale went out of his way to put me into the best room they had. Diego in the Coral Room asked his manager (unbeknownst to me) if he coukd write off the bill for my cream tea. Everything was done to be kind & not for praise.",5,2018,09,24
115,Lovely hotel in perfect location,"My daughter and I just came from a week-long stay at the Bloomsbury and couldn't have been happier. The hotel is on a quiet street away from heavy traffic and street noise, but is only a short dog-leg away from the amenities and eateries of Oxford Street and the beautiful Tottenham Court Road tube stations (not all tube stations are beautiful, but this one is!) Best of all for us, it was just a couple of streets away from the heart of the theatre district and only a 15 minute walk to Piccadilly; since we went to London to see some shows, this proximity was ideal.  Then to have the British Museum just a block away in the other direction, and a short walk to the Dickens House or to Kings Cross, was icing on the cake.  The Bloomsbury was an anchor to all our activities, and we came home at the end of each day to a quiet, clean room, excellent wi-fi coverage, and plenty of space to spread out. The bathroom was huge, with excellent water pressure and consistent hot water. My only complaints were personal in nature: (1) the bed is foam, so it's very comfortable but gets very warm at night - in winter, this is probably ideal, but not so much in balmy September; (2) the bathroom has radiant heat in the floor - again, probably fabulous in winter but overly warm this month, especially after a shower (I ended up by putting my make-up on in the bedroom where it was cooler); and (3) there is no dresser in the room. For my petite daughter and me, we were able to make do with the 1 drawer in the coffer bar area and the shallow drawers in the desk, but 2 normal-size adults would probably have been living out of the suitcase for the week. It's possible that rooms with 2 beds have more drawer space, but my daughter and I were sharing a bed so the 1 drawer was all we had.  My only other comment is an observation rather than a complaint - the towel bar was placed so high on the wall that I couldn't reach it. At 5'2"" I'm short but not abnormally so; who would ever place a towel bar more than 6' off the ground? Fortunately, there was a hook on the wall by the shower which worked just fine.

The morning breakfast deserves special mention.  The Bloomsbury offers up a full English breakfast buffet which we did not have, but also offers up a cold buffet for less money which was more than enough for me - cold cereals, cold meats, fresh fruit, croissants and scones, and freshly hard-boiled eggs.  They also offer an even lesser version of just coffee and croissant/scone, and fruit or juice, which sufficed for my daughter.  Every morning we were greeted by name by the hostess (Estrelita?).  We weren't around enough to eat other meals at the hotel, although they have a nice restaurant on the premises as well as a lively cocktail bar which fronts on the street.  But we did come in late one night to order room service for dessert - a beautiful lemon tart which my daughter said tasted like home and a dish of ice cream for me; the order arrived more quickly than I was expecting and the servings were more generous than I was expecting as well.  The breakfasts were pricey relative to a street cafe, but the convenience, ambiance and the quality were worth it to me.

The staff were all excellent - friendly and helpful. The bedside light blew out the first night and was repaired by our return the next night.  There is nightly turn-down service which we declined when we were there but was provided when we were not.  And despite the presence of a large theater right next door, the hotel was always quiet and comfortable.  It's definitely at the top of my list for any future visit to London.",5,2018,09,24
115,Comfortable,I recently stayed here on business and was very satisfied with the room. The staff were lovely and couldn’t do enough for a wary traveller! A real treat and somewhere I would definitely look to stay again,5,2018,09,20
115,2 days in London,"We had a lovely two days at the Bloomsbury.  The room was a good size for a city hotel.  The breakfast was great.  We had drinks in both bars which had very different personalities but enjoyed both.  Each staff member we came in contact was not only polite and helpful but friendly.  Location was good for the British Museum, theater and tube to other parts of London.  Would recommend to friends and definitely stay again.",5,2018,09,18
115,Amazing second visit for our 1st anniversary ,"I can’t rate this hotel and it’s staff enough. We came here for our first wedding anniversary and we were upgraded (again) and they made such a lovely effort putting heart balloons, a card and a gorgeous candle in our room. 
You just are made to feel so special by the staff, and the hotel is in the perfect place for everything you want to do in London. 
",5,2018,09,18
115,"Wonderful hotel, friendly staff, accommodating to our family","We stayed at the Bloomsbury for 6 nights. We brought out 1.5 year old and the entire staff was accommodating to us.

Check-in: despite arriving at 9am, they still let us stay in a room until ours was ready. Not something we expected but we were very happy about it! 

The hotel is located in a great area near a tube stop and lots of dining and shopping.

Room itself: Very clean, up to date and had everything we needed. They had a baby crib and baby essentials for us in the room. Even a mini fridge was provided to keep her milk cold. The only drawback was the Air Conditioning couldn't keep up so the room was humid and warm despite being turned on. 

Breakfast: Maria and her staff were great - every morning they set up a table for us with a high chair and made us feel welcome. 

Traveling with a toddler is not easy but the Bloomsbury made it pleasant and fun. 

Our room was positioned above the entrance street so it was a bit noisy at times.",5,2018,09,17
115,Perfect hotel in perfect spot,"Stayed here for one night for our wedding anniversary as we were going to the theatre round the corner.Staff couldn't have been nicer, we arrived at 1pm and although check-in was not this 3pm they had our room ready and had upgraded us to a suite. The suite was massive, with a huge bathroom, walk-in wardrobe/dressing room and comfy chairs. While we were unpacking one of the staff brought us some chocolate-dipped strawberries on a plate with ""Happy Anniversary"" in chocolate, which was a lovely touch. We didn't dine in the hotel, but did have a drink in the bar before going out - prices for wine and bear were reasonable, other drinks a little pricey but what you'd expect. Plenty of waiters in quite a small bar meant it was almost too cosy! when we returned from the theatre there was a big heart shape on the bed made of silk rose petals, with more tastefully scattered on the floor. (I thought it was tasteful but hubby is a Virgo and said ""look at the mess!. Some men are just not romantic I suppose!) Breakfast was lovely, with a full continental and English buffet with the option to choose a plated dish - I had the best eggs royale I've had for a long time.

Just a couple of very minor downs: the bathroom had a few problems - shower door didn't close properly causing a flood, hole in one of the twin basins, grab rail too loose to be reliable (luckily I didn't need it), no sound on the bathroom TV (1st world problem, but whatever is fitted in a room I expect to work, whether its a necessary item or not!) While at breakfast my husband wanted a second coffee, but the waiting staff all seemed to have disappeared, and my plates were piling up, but this was sorted after a slightly long wait.

I would definitely stay there again, perfectly placed for what we were doing and so close to the British Museum we easily wandered round for an hour after breakfast, leaving our case with the concierge. The staff went out of their way to make our special event extra special and romantic (sorry my husband is just not romantic in that way, but I appreciated it!)",5,2018,09,17
115,Excellent location and service.  Charming.,"Amazing find near the British Museum, and the theater district.  High quality restaurant with a superb Sunday brunch, extensive breakfast and the best bar. Visually a delight.  The real gem of this hotel is the quality of the staff who were always providing excellent service and real commitment to make your stay memorable.",5,2018,09,16
115,Luxery away from home with a comfortable tranqual aesthetic,Thank you all for such a fabulous safe stay with wonderful amenities.  Your attention to detail and staff and food was outstanding!  The close proximity to all the areas was exactly what I needed to be able to have a home base for all the city entertainment. I will be back!!!!,5,2018,09,15
115,Wonderful Hotel!!,"We recently stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel and found it to be an excellent decision.  Our room was fantastic, the staff friendly and extremely helpful with any requests/questions.  We enjoyed our evening nightcaps at the bar which had a wide assortment of drinks . . . from cocktails to wine to you name it!!  We especially enjoyed the breakfast each morning before we set out exploring the city.  The location was perfect to catch the Tube and we also liked having small family restaurants within walking distance at dinner time.",5,2018,09,14
115,Probably the best hotel experience in central London!,"Seriously one of the best hotels I have stayed in - and I have travelled the world and stayed in plenty five star properties.  So what makes the Bloomsbury stand out.  First of all it is a classy, chic, beautifully decorated hotel off the beaten track in central London (but just a few steps from the hustle and bustle of shopping streets, classy Mayfair and Marylebone, Hyde Park and Regents Park),  Secondly the amazing, friendly and serviceminded staff (they have indeed recruited and trained well :-))  And lastly, we had a complimentary private guided walk around Bloomsbury/Fitzrovia that was off the beaten track which I can heartily recommend as we really enjoyed learning about this areas interesting history och historical figures. Oh and even the restaurants at the Bloomsbury are really good. Staying here is a guarantee for a good start for a holiday or a business trip.  I will definitely stay here on my next trip to London.",5,2018,09,14
115,Fabulous,Great place to stay with friendly staff. Fabulous location for visiting London and theatre land. Nothing too much trouble and really comfortable rooms and beautifully set out hotel.  With so much choice in London very few are of this standard. ,5,2018,09,13
115,Superb location and hotel!,"I stayed here for 2 nights recently and think the hotel is an excellent choice. The location is 5 mins from Tottenham Court Rd tube station. The staff are very welcoming and provided an upgrade as a Discovery member. The rooms, 806 and 425, were very comfortable. I checked out and had to check in again, hence the different rooms. The breakfast has plenty of choice, everything is fresh and hot. Eggs benedict was superb. Highly recommended.",5,2018,09,11
115,Amazing room & great high quality hotel ,"I really enjoyed my time & specially the room was gorgeous, the food was excellent; Paul our waiter from Zambia was an excellent host & Kevin our barman created amazing tasty rums old fashioned cockatils. Felt great and they really look after us. Thank you ",5,2018,09,11
115,"Comfortable Stay, Friendly Staff, But...","This is a pretty nice hotel in London and its location is amazing. 3 mins walk to Oxford Street and Tube station. The staff is very friendly and never hesitate to help you in any way. Though small, my room is clean and cosy, definitely a home away from home. Bed is comfortable and has everything you need to have a comfortable stay.

I would have given a 5 star rating, but I encountered an issue during my stay. The hot water supply at my shower room was intermittent. It turned from very COLD to very HOT and then very COLD again. It keeps on without turning the tap. That affects my overall experience of my stay. I got the staff to come to my room to look at it, but it seems fine and hours later, the problem came back.

But overall, the hotel is pretty decent and definitely world class in terms of service and location.",3,2018,09,10
115,A gem!,"I haven't been writing many reviews lately, but our trip to the Bloomsbury was so exceptional that I thought it time to start again.

This is a terrific hotel.  The property is beautifully designed.  Great location.  The rooms are comfortable.  And the service was exceptional.  A special thanks to Than, who helped us out when my wife wasn't feeling well.

We will definitely be back!",5,2018,09,10
115,Luxury,"I stayed here as the second part of a business trip and it was truly amazing. Pure comfort. The staff could not do enough for you. I was unfortunately unable to explore the restaurant and bar but look forward to exploring this on my next visit.

Would highly recommend a stay here for either business or leisure. I will definitely be back here but for a leisure visit.",5,2018,09,09
115,Exceptional!,"We booked a last minute room at The Bloomsbury for a 2 night stay - having previously stayed numerous times at the wonderful Firmdale groups Covent Garden and Soho Hotel (which didn't have any rooms available) - and were somewhat apprehensive as didn't know what to expect.  We were blown away with the room, the staff, and the fantastic bar!  So much so that we are planning to return in December for another 2 night stay.  I can't recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2018,09,08
115,Perfect for the West End,We stayed on a Friday night in order to go to a West End play. It was perfect. Just on the edge of the really busy areas so a short walk to the fun and a good night's sleep.  The room was very comfortable and the breakfast excellent. All the staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Thanks!,5,2018,09,08
115,Weekend in London,"Excellent experience, nice hotel and very helpful and friendly staff. Everything was perfect from check in to check out. Walking distance to many attractions and conveniently close to tube.  
We would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2018,09,06
115,"Almost excellent, grown in my estimation","Have been here a number of times. the Refurb a year or so ago has improved the hotel in some ways (bar now on ground level (as well as the nice, quieter one in basement still), entrance from both Great Russell St and just off Oxford St and not in others (the reception area especially is very small and room only for two reception staff plus one concierge in a tight space, which can make checknig in or out a bit of an unnecessarily long process). Room has everything you need incl tea and coffee facilities. Service is very good to excellent. Very helpful and pleasant team all round. Overall it is a great location, right by the tube and New Oxford st, is a reasonable price for London and service is excellent.",4,2018,09,06
115,Lovely boutique style hotel with friendly staff in great location,"Stayed here for 5 nights with my family.  It is a well run hotel with welcoming and friendly staff.  Our rooms were a good size (for London) and beds very comfy.  Nice bathroom and toiletries.  Breakfast was included in our room rate and was excellent.  There was a buffet (breads, cheeses, cereals, meats, jams, fruit) and there was also a menu to order from which included full English breakfast, benedicts, oatmeal and some other things I don't remember.  Service was very friendly.  
The location is perfect for walking to many tourist sites and good shopping.  There is a tube station (Tottenham Court Road) 2 minutes walk from hotel.  Gym was small but well equipped.  We had drinks at the Coral Bar every night.  A beautifully decorated bar with friendly bartenders.  We also ate dinner there a few nights.  There is a nice restaurant that is on a patio where they serve high tea.  Did not have the tea but did have lunch and dinner there once which was very good.  
The Concierge helped us a lot with advise on restaurants, making reservations for us and one who tried to get us into pubs to watch the World Cup (England vs. Croatia).  He made so many calls for us to try to get us a table.  And another one who gave us the best advise on our last day to take a taxi to Paddington Station and take the fast train to Heathrow, rather than taking a taxi from the hotel to Heathrow.  We wouldn't have made our flight if we would have taken taxi all the way to Heathrow, as we left it too late. 
I look forward to staying here again on my next trip to London.",5,2018,09,05
115,A wonderful stay,"We had a great time at The Bloomsbury, all the staff are so friendly and helpful.  The food and cocktails were devine.  Everything was very comfortable and relaxing.  We were made to feel so welcome.  Thank you.",5,2018,09,05
115,2nd visit to this lovely hotel,"I have just returned from my 5 night stay at The Bloomsbury in London.
The hotel is very well situated for all the major Theatres and transport links.
On arrival the reception staff were very polite and checked me in with great efficiency.
The room was comfortable and provided me with enough storage space for my belongings.
I greatly recommend taking breakfast at this wonderful hotel. The variety of dishes available is excellent, ranging from cereal to a full English breakfast even making eggs benedict. The staff are all very friendly with a warm and welcoming smile each day, they really go the extra mile to help start your day well.
After a hard day doing the typical tourist things, it was really nice to come back and have a quiet drink in the Bloomsbury Club before retiring to bed.  The bar staff again were very friendly even remembering which wine I was drinking each day. Please pass on my many thanks to all your staff.",5,2018,09,03
115,25th wedding anniversary weekend,"A little treat for my wife as it was our 25th wedding anniversary . we have stayed at the  Bloomsbury a few times before and we can not fault it .My wife had booked the room. I phoned a few days later to explain it was our anniversary and would it be possible to upgrade the room and have some flowers, chocolates and a bottle of bubbly put in the room , i spoke to Michola? Machala ?
 (sorry if i have spelt this wrong )...and she was most helpful and nothing was to much bother for her.
  When we arrived the room was beautiful, with rose petals , strawberry's, chocolates , Balloons and a bottle of fizz soaking away in a bucket of ice ,( that must have been put in the room the moment we arrived in reception,excellent planning, thank you so much)
 with a lovely note congratulating us on our anniversary.
The room, the staff. the food, the service, the price .....all excellent , first class ,. we love this hotel and the staff and we will definitely be returning when we come down to london again.
To the owners of this company/Hotel, thank you so much and you should be very proud of your beautiful hotel and fantastic staff.
sorry about my writing and spelling im not very good at it.",5,2018,09,02
115,A cozy stay,"I travelled at a family with a toddler. The property is located right smack on a quiet street off Oxford street and a stone’s throw away from Tottenham tube station, couldn’t have asked for a better location. 

Service is impeccable from the bell boy to the turn down service. 

The Room was on the small side but extremely well kept and really cozy. The walls are thick and well insulated so the room was quiet and we weren’t afraid that we might be disturbing our neighbour when our toddler cried in the middle of the night. They provided a crib for us too. 

The coffee machine and complimentary water was a nice touch. 

Only things I would have to complain about if I nitpicked:

The fridge - it was this high tech fridge so we weren’t able to store items in the fridge, you had to call the reception to store these items which was a hassle. Breast milk in my case. 

Bedroom slippers - we couldn’t find any, it would be nice if they provided them. 

All in all a great stay! Definitely above and beyond a typical 4 star hotel!",5,2018,09,02
115,Extraordinary,"I used to stay here years ago for business - it was always exceptional but very quiet. I always found it odd that it wasn't more popular given its location.  Now Doyles have taken it over exclusively and refurbished it its is just stunning.  And significantly more popular. Everything is beautifully done and the staff are all faultlessly attentive.  Its serene, luxurious and calm - and so beautifully decorated.",5,2018,09,01
115,Great stay in Holburn,"The best thing about this spot is the Coral room! So lush and inviting. The rooms are decent, and the bathroom was massive (I think perhaps because I had a handicap room...?) Staff were pleasant, and overall it was an easy stay. Great if you're looking to be walking distance from central London and the British Museum.",4,2018,08,31
115,Beautiful Design Hotel in Soho 5*,"My Fiance and I travelled to London in July of this year to visit family.  We wanted a hotel in Soho but not at crazy prices!  Our family were staying at a well known hotel on Neal Street and I know the area well I searched online for hotels in the same area.  After much online checking we settled for The Bloomsbury Hotel just behind Tottenham Court Road Tube station.  We absolutley made the right choice! The staff are all lovely the interior design is amazing and the rooms/bathrooms spacious for a central london hotel.  The location is perfect to walk out and about to Oxford Street, Covent Garden, Leicester Square etc.  Inside the hotel the design is out of this world - the bar is beautifully designed as is the outdoor terrace! Just a super stay and we would 100% recommend staying at this hotel if on business or pleasure its a gem!",5,2018,08,29
115,Most Brilliant Staff/Location,"This was our first stay at The Bloomsbury and I will never stay anywhere else but here in London. The location of the hotel is a 5 minute walk from Tottenham Court Road Station and 10 minutes from both Oxford Street and Covent Garden. It is kept from all of the street noise and tucked away in its own little retreat. The staff has been nothing, but accommodating, kind, and invested in what they do. They truly care about the guests’ well-being while staying at the Bloomsbury. They even went out of the way to send a notebook and pen set to my daughter as they knew she was going away for school. If you don’t stay at the Bloomsbury, you’re missing out on an incredible experience. I would recommend this place for anybody wanting to have a great London experience.",5,2018,08,26
115,Luxury place to stay in Lodon,Well placed for tubes for easy access  to most parts of London. Close to shopping in Oxford Street. Excellent service from staff. Music in bar in the evening. Close to Dominion Theatre so a little noisy at night.,5,2018,08,26
115,Ticks all the boxes,"We needed to be in the Bloomsbury area for a couple of nights, and this hotel has all we needed at a reasonable rate for London. The main thing that stood out was how helpful and efficient all the staff were, from the porters to the check in staff, and the breakfast and Coral Lounge waiting staff. The breakfast is very good too! Add to this the interesting history of the hotel, and the Lutyens architecture, it was just right for us. We hope they manage to restore the original swimming pool, could be quite special and different, definitely worth doing! Keep up the good work!",5,2018,08,25
115,Perfect Combination,"What a fabulous combination, ultra stylish & great location and to cap it all a pretty good price for London (c£220 via Amoma).  On a completely separate but related note it's the first time I have booked a hotel through Amoma and had a couple of reasons to contact them and change the booking slightly, not having heard of them before I was skeptical about the level of service I would receive but both times they were incredible prompt and my issues were resolved within 24 hours - would recommend them.

We stayed for our wedding anniversary and checked in separately, the concierge were ultra welcoming when I walked in as was the receptionist - they had upgraded us from a cosy to classic room, which was a pretty standard size for a London room, but beautifully decorated.  

However, you don't really spend much time in your hotel room when you are in London and what impressed us more was the beautiful settings of the various bars and restaurants.  We had a couple of drinks in the Coral Room, which is a great setting very art deco bar and live music on a Friday night despite being busy on the on the terrace service sat at the bar was great.  

The hotel is within walking distance of Soho making it so convenient and we rounded our evening off at The Bloomsbury Club bar with Reversed Old Fashioned's (thoroughly recommended) brilliant bar staff and amazing late night venue.  It is our first stay at a Doyle Collection hotel and would absolutely stay here again and look at other properties of theirs in the future.",5,2018,08,25
115,Average Stay in London,"Our small room was a pleasant size, though check-in could have been a much smoother process. After a red eye flight and 7:45 am arrival, my boyfriend and I requested an early check-in time. The front desk greeted us warmly and we were told our room would likely be ready before our scheduled 3 pm check-in time as requested. Unfortunately we were not able to get into our room until 3:40 pm and the bed was a bit uncomfortable so we did not get quality rest. The bar in the Coral Room was a great place to have a drink. All in all, we had an average stay.",3,2018,08,24
115,Our little oasis,Staying at The Bloomsbury made our London trip extra special. We loved relaxing in the Coral Room lounge after a day of fun sightseeing. The location is terrific and the hotel staff were exceptional. Staying at this hotel is a memorable part of our trip to London.,5,2018,08,22
115,Old Fashioned Friendly Service,"I stayed at The Bloomsbury for the first time with my daughter. We were celebrating her 10th birthday with a trip to the theatre. From start to finish we were treated with the greatest of care and friendliness. Once the birthday was discovered the staff ALL seemed to know about it and  made our stay a complete pleasure for us both, even bringing up a birthday card and gift which had been especially sought. Made my job very easy. Plan to visit again alone or with friends to spend longer relaxing with you and a good book. Sarah WoodrowCambridge & Singapore",5,2018,08,21
115,Love this hotel.,"Staff were very helpful and polite.

The room was large and comfortable.

There were two demerits:

Just one = Unless we went really early, we always had to queue for breakfast. Now either there is inadequate seating for the hotel guests or there are too many people from outside coming to the hotel to eat breakfast. Either way, I do not expect to queue in a hotel of this standard.",5,2018,08,21
115,Superb as always in London.,"This is our favorite hotel in London by far and our last stay did improve the already good impression. A great welcome by Gunilla and her team made the experience as memorable as it should be when arriving to The Bloomsbury. Since our last visit the reception has been moved and replaced by a wonderful bar, The Corral Room, which serves tasteful food and lovely drinks. The new reception area is smaller, but has given space for a waiting lounge which works well. We had the joy of having a whiskey tasting in Bloomsbury Club with the talented Brian, a recommendable experience! This stay we were also lucky to stay in one of the corner studio suites, room 521, and what a room! A beautifully decorated room, painted dark blue with wooden floors and a cozy atmosphere made the perfect frame for a grand finale of our holiday to England. Our best recommendations and congratulations to the management for an awesome total experience. ",5,2018,08,21
115,Must Stay!,We rarely visit London but when we do the Bloomsbury is a must. The location is perfect and most things are within easy walking distance. We arrived to a polite and professional reception and throughout our stay we commented on how upbeat and friendly all staff were.. always going the extra mile to help you. We stayed in a luxurious room that made it tempting not to leave the hotel. The Coral Room bar had an exotic vibe and the cocktails were to die for. We were extremely impressed with the restaurant which had a relaxed but sophisticated atmosphere. Breakfast was served with a smile and the selection was good. The Bloomsbury clearly have happy staff and forward thinking management. Look forward to staying again soon.,5,2018,08,19
115,"Service, Location, and Beauty","My family stayed in The Bloomsbury for a week.  We loved starting our morning with Iohut, Victor, and Maria in the breakfast room.  All three of them were warm, funny, and delightful making us feel welcome and sending us out in good humor on a full stomach. We made full use the concierge who helped us get familiar with the underground, the buses, and the taxis.  They made restaurant reservations and got us into places we were told were booked a month in advance.  So, we had lunch at 2.  It was perfect.  The rooms were nicely done.  We were put in a tiny room to begin with an moved to a larger room when we requested more space. Hotel is close to theaters, Covent Gardens, Chinatown, the River, buses and underground.",5,2018,08,19
115,Best hotel in London,"The hotel is beautiful,a dream for design lovers, the team is perfect- IVAN from the reception is so helpful and nice, the breakfast is super! Great food and versatility of choices, the team service in the breakfast is 5 star, we to thank to this wonderful and nice team- Maria,Victor,Ionut,Dimitar and Kinga. We truly recommend to get this hotel,we will come back. The all services and experience is just wow",5,2018,08,19
115,Luxury while working,We use this hotel for training events so I am working when staying here but it's not like work when you are staying in such a lovely hotel.  The staff are always so welcoming and I feel relaxed and secure when here.,5,2018,08,17
115,Highly recommended ,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 7 nights with our grandson.  The hotel stay was perfect. The staff made us feel welcome and could not do enough for us.  The room was large and very clean. The facilities were excellent.  Staff brought a class of milk and biscuits for my grandson each night of our stay.  He thought this was fantastic. Staff took the time to ask how our day was and seemed very interest3d in what we had done.  This hotel, the staff, the location, and the facilities provided were fantastic and will definitely be staying there again when we return to London",5,2018,08,15
115,Hotel Fabulous,"We've stayed here several times and since last year the hotel has had some refurbishments, an amazing new bar and a sitting room area which is beautiful. Most of the staff were more than helpful and friendly, a special word for Samir in the bar on the Friday night, he was a gent. On check in the girl was far from friendly, had hardly a word to say. Saturday night we spent quite a while in the bar spending over 100 pounds. When we were leaving the girl that came with the bill and whom we paid was so rude. I'm not actually sure if she said a word. This is very bad business. Rooms are fab, spacious and supplied with coffee, biscuits and water daily.  One of the mornings it was quite noisy, not sure where it was coming from. Location is perfect, few minutes walk from the busy oxford street and also from the tube station going to and coming from the airport. 
One more issue that bothered us was in the bar at night there was a bad drain smell and the barman told us that the previous week there had been problems with drains. This was quite off putting.
Overall love this hotel but we had issues last year and again this year so we're not sure if we'll be returning to stay here.",4,2018,08,14
115,Great hotel in a great location,"The hotel is situated in the busy area near oxford street and covent garden but the atmosphere takes you from that into a peaceful experience. The staff are attentive the rooms are very well decorated and it we had a fantastic nights sleep for the 3 nights we stayed. 
thank you for making our stay so enjoyable",5,2018,08,14
115,Pinnacle of graciousness,"We had a lovely stay at The Bloomsbury on a brief holiday with our grandchildren.  The staff was very accommodating, the beds, pillows, bathrooms perfect.  What makes the hotel special is the gracious staff.  To a person, they are kind, considerate, very pleasant and friendly.   

The hotel also has great restaurants as well.  I can't say enough about the wait staff.  We had dinner, afternoon tea, and twice we had breakfast.  The food was elegantly prepared and delicious.  I want especially to compliment Ionut in the breakfast room who was our waiter twice. What a lovely, considerate man.  Also serving us were Victor and Maria who  were efficient, prompt, and all three did everything to please us.",5,2018,08,14
115,Oasis of perfection,"We arrived at the Bloomsbury to be greeted by the Concierge who chatted to us about our plans for our stay. We were ridiculously early and did not expect our room to be ready so relocated to the terrace for healthy smoothies, before heading out on the town. When we returned later our room was ready and our bags brought up. Our room was just as we had asked for, quiet, extremely comfortable and delightfully cool!
We were surprised and delighted by the notes and gifts that appeared in the room during our stay. Where else would you find a book of poetry in the room? 
We had booked dinner in Dalloway Terrace and made our way down via the spectacular Coral Room where we stopped for a drink and were greeted by a lively buzz and live cool jazz. Definitely the place to be, but dinner called! 
The Terrace provided an excellent range of dishes which catered to all tastes, vegetarians included. 
When it came to check out we, once again, were met by the concierge who greeted us by name and enquired about our stay, remembering the details of our original conversation! This was such a PR triumph for the hotel!
All the staff were extremely polite, welcoming and efficient. ",5,2018,08,13
115,Dalloway Terrace,"We where going to have the pre theater 3 course set menu at £35 each, but felt it was too limited in what was on offer and if i want fish 'n chips....i live in Southend on Sea where there are 100's of chippies ! So we had the normal menu which worked out with a cocktail and wine £148 meal for 2 . Wendy had Belly Pork and Black Pudding and a mustard sauce.I had Devon crab on toast then the Wrack of Lamb for two to share, with a slightly salty sauce, Green Beans and New Potatoes, then she had Lemon Tart and I had a coffee, spilling £1.50's worth into the saucer .I thought it all bit expensive, though Wendy, who eats out in London more than I do said it was average price for London... but it was well worth it ! (Plus,  as I was in hospital on my birthday so like the queen I'm having 2) The staff where attentive but not over bearing, very helpful waiter Georgieo, who seemed to be having hes picture taken with lots of other dinners really wowed the evening along. I'm saving up to go again !",5,2018,08,13
115,Wonderful experience ,"Went there for my boyfriend’s birthday, the hotel room was beautiful and as I told them it was his birthday prior to our visit, they really went the extra mile and left a little birthday message, a little cake and when we came back after seeing our west end show they’d put rose petals everywhere (picture attached).

Breakfast was really nice and the hotel bar is beautiful and very classy. 

Location was also great if you’re looking to see a show, 2 minutes walk from the tube station. 

Will 100% recommend to friends and family and we’re already planning our return.",5,2018,08,13
115,A very fine establishment.,"My husband and I have just celebrated our 28th wedding anniversary at The Bloomsbury Hotel , which was top class . All the staff were exceptional pulling out all the stops to make our weekend very special. Thanks to David Andrrews , the restaurant manger of The Dalloway Terrace and all of the staff for a great evening. Everything was just perfect . We will definitely be returning 😊",5,2018,08,12
115,City Break and Cricket,First time I have stayed here and the service was special and we had a great night in the bar and restaurant rather then venturing out as we felt so comfortable.  The room was larger than I expected and filled with some very nice touches which always make you feel like the hotel has gone just a bit further than you expected.  All in all I'm a difficult person to really please but they managed it.  Thank you!,5,2018,08,12
115,2 days at the Bloomsbury ,"Very nice hotel. Loved the outdoor terrace restaurant seating on both sides of the entrance.  Bloomsbury has all the amenities you would expect in this caliber of hotel. One big surprise was the Coral Bar, which is very attractive, and probably the busiest “hotel bar” I have seen anywhere in Europe/UK. 

When I travel with my wife I normally book a “nicer” hotel than when I travel on business. I would put the Bloomsbury on this list, which includes hotels like Dukes, The Stafford and The St James. Very impressive. 

Thanks for a great stay

115,"Beautifully decorated, nice staff and gorgeous rooms","We arrived late on a Friday, and walked into a stunning bar(we took the wrong entrance). With some guidance, we found our way to reception, they seemed to have computer troubles, but the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming. 
During check-in, due to capacity, we got upgraded to the suite. This is the most incredible hotel room I've ever had the privilege of staying in. It was decorated beautifully, much like all the other rooms. 

The breakfast was a combination of a large buffet and food made upon request.  The buffet had nice ingredients, and lots to choose from. From what I could tell from other guests, you could request most things to be cooked within reason. Once again, really lovely staff. 

The hotel is in a great location.

I'll be staying here again, even without the upgrade I think this has to be my favourite hotel going forward. ",5,2018,08,08
115,Terrific property,"My family stayed at this property the week on July 22nd and thoroughly enjoyed it!  The property is lovely and located in the perfect spot near Soho and the West End area with plenty of restaurants and shopping locations.  The rooms are comfortable with air conditioning and Wi-Fi.  We enjoyed having cocktails in the Coral Room bar on two separate occasions and they have wonderful service. I would suggest the afternoon tea or dinner reservations at the Dalloway Terrace, which is just beautiful and the food is amazing.  We used their concierge services for recommendations and both gentleman working the desk were top notch!  The property is affiliated with the Doyle Collection of hotels- which is closely tied to the Omni hotel properties in the United States.  If I find myself in London again, I will definitely try to make a return to The Bloomsbury!",5,2018,08,08
115,Great location and beautiful stylish hotel,"Stayed for 6 days in June, recovering from two weeks in India! Enjoyed the decor and service, the restaurants were excellent for breakfast plus two dinners apres theatre. Concierge was challenged, did not answer emails prior to arrival so some requests went unheeded. Overall a great place to stay if you are handling your own travel planning.",4,2018,08,08
115,NEVER fails to disappoint. A hidden true hidden gem,"The Bloomsbury is a home from home....It really is a hidden gem & truly never, ever fails to disappoint. The team here are always so welcoming, warm & genuine. The rooms are immaculate & always beautifully presented. The menus & ambience of both the Dalloway & Coral bar are both second to none.....an amazing vibe, coupled with great staff. 

Thank you to all at the Bloomsbury; you are all just fantastic, in particular Mr Healey...an asset to this wonderful establishment. We can’t wait to return & as always will continue to recommend. 

",5,2018,08,06
115,Top drawer,"This is a terrific hotel. This is the 4th time we’ve stayed and each time has got better. 
All of the rooms we’ve stayed in have been tasteful, airy, spacious and quiet. We’ve never had to endure the noise of other guests banging their doors or talking loudly in the corridors.
The room facilities are excellent with a Nespresso machine with complimentary capsules and a well stocked minibar. The beds are very comfortable with good quality bedsheets.
We had plenty of interesting reading matter and there were nice glasses to drink our champagne out of.
Going downstairs, there is the vibrant and popular bar named The Coral Room. The waiters and barristas are all knowledgeable and so attentive. Nothing is too much trouble, which is precisely how it should be in a top flight establishment.
May I heartily praise the 6 feet nine inches tall Doorman, Big James who had assisted us on several occasions to find cabs, clubs, hidden pearl eateries and so on. He fulfills perfectly the archetypal role of ‘concierge’ and is a gold mine of information ‘ delivered with a friendly smile.
He’s a great asset to the hotel.
We enjoyed breakfast downstairs and were amazed that the Maitre d’ Maria not only remembers us from a few months ago but recalled that I’d changed tables twice before I found the perfect one for us. Very impressive. This goes for all the staff. We had a similar experience on the Dalloway Terrace at lunch on our second day. The food was good and plentiful. 
We learned there was to be a complimentary guided walk around Bloomsbury at 11 am for 2 hours. It was run by Janet, an accredited London guide. It went too quickly and Janet did a good job.
After visiting a show in the evening we returned to The Bloomsbury to hear the second set from Kitty LaRoar. An extraordinarily talented jazz songstress who could easily pass for Ella F if you close your eyes. It was a quality and accomplished act and definitely not a lacklustre,cheap fill in band.
After a good nights undisturbed sleep we had lunch on The Dalloway Terrace. It’s scrumptious. reasonably priced and good value.
In summary, a great hotel which deserves its star rating. 
We’re back next weekend to go to Ronnie’s.

115,Fabulous hotel,"Stayed here for the first time in June 18, great hotel and great service. Wonderful accommodation, definitely a step above the rest. Would highly recommend for anyone looking to stay in this part of London. Price dictates service and this place certainly delivers on that.",5,2018,08,06
115,Another great stat,"I usually spend 1 week a year in London and my band stays at the Bloomsbury. I've always liked it, and now with the renovations it's even nicer.
 The staff is awesome.
 Thank you Maria, Marina, Victor, Donata and the rest of the staff! ",5,2018,08,06
115,Proposal,"I was staying at the hotel and eating in the restaurant as part of the evening I was going to propose. I popped the question in the room and the night was incredible... made entirely by the effort the hotel team put in.

They really did everything to make it the most incredible experience.

Could not recommend highly enough.",5,2018,08,06
115,A Family weekend in London,"Firstly the location is ideal for quick easy access to most theatres and the West End.
The hotel is beautifully decorated and the welcome at reception is warm and friendly.
The rooms are very well appointed - and the various bars are all worth exploring.
I believe that the staff are hugely important in making the hotel special - and help to make you feel relaxed and that the quality of your stay is important to them.",5,2018,08,06
115,Great Hotel and fantastic AC!,"The Bloomsbury is a great hotel and a great location of the city. Well appointed rooms, great restaurants and the hub of shopping in London - what more could you want................ hang on........ it also a stones throw from Soho, Chinatown and more.......... its always about location, location, location ............",5,2018,08,06
115,Amazing is the only way to describe this hotel,"Stayed with friends for a 50th birthday celebration. 
Amazing from start to finish. 
Great room, amazing food and staff. 
A memorable stay and we will go back for sure. Thank you to all the staff and the manager. 

",5,2018,08,05
115,Poor customer service,"The hotel was very pleasant and the room was spacious and well appointed.  However, the customer service from the reception and concierge was dreadful.  We had an issue with our stay, and the reception's solution was to waive the charge that shouldn't have been on our bill in the first place.  This smacks of adding things on just to take them off again, and thus not dealing with the issue we had.  The concierge was slow and was more interested in trying to sell things to a group of American tourists rather than dealing with the matter he was supposed to be dealing with.

In respect of breakfast, coffee refills were hard to get, and hash browns were soggy, otherwise nothing out of the ordinary.",2,2018,08,04
115,Five star stay @one of Londons top hotels,"Just returned home from a fantastic stay at The Bloomsbury , 5 Star 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟experience from start to finish , decor fabulous, staff very professional and friendly especially Maria and Marina from the breakfast room , eggs benedict was amazing , plenty of choice for breakfast , they couldn't do enough for us , service was second to none, food from the Dalloway terrace , food was of very high standard , a lovely outdoor area to enjoy brunch, lunch and afternoon tea, great buzz around this hotel and lovely ambience , delicious cocktails made in The Coral Room , very relaxed environment to unwind and enjoy a drink after a busy day sight seeing around London , hotel is very central to main shopping streets oxford street , tube and bus travel within 2 min walk , Dominion Theatre next door to enjoy any show , currently showing Bat out of Hell musical which I would highly recommend to any music/theatre lover , cannot say enough about this Hotel , it is a Gem !

115,The Bloomsbury is Best,"This was my first trip to London and The Bloomsbury exceeded our expectations in every way.
Location 5 stars if you love theatre as much as we do you can’t miss 10-15 min walk to most shows and even quicker if you take Tottenham station tube
The room was perfect for the three of us and noise was never issue. Nice and heavy drapes keeps the light out in the morning 
The highlight of this place is the Concierge named Ivan. Took the time to explain everything in the room when we arrived. And was also happy to see us Ivan went above and beyond the call every time the 10 days we stayed. 
My favorite story of Ivan was the time a corner store a couple blocks  down tried to scam me out of 50 dollars when I went to exchange it for pounds. They said I only gave them 50 when I knew I gave them 100. I told Ivan about it and he left the hotel and went down to the corner store and got me my money back.
He made every aspect of our trip better 
He even gave my daughter a teddy bear when we left. I would highly recommend The Bloomsbury to anyone traveling to London 
Make sure you ask for Ivan!
Be prepared to be pampered however they are the best!",5,2018,08,02
115,Oasis,"Stayed here for two night when on business in London. It is so close to Tottenham Court road and central London, yet feels like an oasis of calm. There is a buzz about the bar and restaurant, so I am not saying it is sleepy … just tranquil and unrushed. Nice décor and good sized rooms, not big but adequate. A good place to stay right in the centre of things.",4,2018,08,01
115,Accommodating Staff - Great location,"Stayed here for 5 nights.  My wife and I with three kids. We had two rooms. Rooms were comfortable. The location was close to theaters and great restaurants, and only 1 block away from the British Museum. 
The staff could not have been more accommodating and helpful.  ",4,2018,08,01
115,Favorite London hotel.,I stay here every time I am in London and I rarely want to leave. I stay here for business and pleasure trips and it never lets me down. You could stay on the terrace dining all day. The staff are also as cool and helpful as you will find in any hotel in London. Highly recommend this spot.,5,2018,07,27
115,Blooming Marvellous!,"From the moment we arrived for our two night stay, we received attentive, professional and efficient service. Beautiful surroundings, great food and a wonderful cocktail bar. We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. The staff are to be praised for their 5* customer care. ",5,2018,07,27
115,Classy on every level,"Have not stayed so this is a review on the bar and food areas only.

I have been at the Bloomsbury Hotel a handful of times over the last year for drinks and food with colleagues and clients, as well as with friends. I work near Goodge Street so I would previously choose occasionally the Charlotte St Hotel and The Gymnasium Bar at King's X (the latter being my go-to place).

The food at the BH is great and the Dalloway Terrace is an oasis just off Tottenham Ct Road, as well as the softly lit downstairs area and the Club Bar.
But what is truly superb about the Bloomsbury is their cocktails, their stunning Coral room (not even the photo on their website does it justice) and the service. Professional, courteous and discreet.

And here is what makes service in an establishment stand out: Very recently, while drinking at the Dalloway Terrace, my white shirt was stained from dried red wine under a table, unfortunately missed following a spillage being cleaned.

Within 5 minutes, the smiling Floor Manager Rowan had given me a fresh white shirt and taken mine for dry cleaning. At no charge and with two delicious cocktail shots as an apology. 

I picked it up the other day, whiter than white. And Rowan wanted me to keep the other shirt. With a smile.

That is what makes the Bloomsbury a classy place to be.

Hats off to you Rowan, as well as to your colleagues who mix as well as they do at Claridges.

Fair to say, the BH is my new haunt.",5,2018,07,26
115,Wonderful hotel and location,"My daughter and I, stayed 5 nights at the Bloomsbury hotel. The location is Great - near the theater district/covent garden and oxford st. Subway is 200 m away.
Friendly and  helpful staff, good food and clean room.  Primark store is  also very close.",5,2018,07,25
115,"Clean, quiet upscale hotel near Theatre district.","Very clean rooms, easy access to the Theatre District. Very friendly staff. Cool bar on the main floor and even cooler, hip hidden bar in the basement. Good wifi. Bed was very comfortable and room was quiet. Would stay again.",5,2018,07,25
115,Very recommendable Hotel in Central London,"We stayed four nights at The Bloomsbury for vacation. The hotel has a beautiful and modern design. The rooms are quiet and very comfortable, with Nespresso machine, tea & coffee. The location is very central, with nearby access to the Tube at Tottenham Court Road and walking distance to Oxford Street. We really enjoyed the breakfast at Dalloway Terrace, too. Due to illness I unfortunately was not able to try the wonderful Afternoon Tea and Dinner there. The Coral Room looks nice, too for having a cocktail or food. Staff was very friendly and helpful. We can´t wait to come back again!",5,2018,07,25
115,Exceeded expectations in every way...,"What a wonderful hotel. Friendly and helpful staff, modern and well appointed room, and really good food. It was also great that the hotel was within short walking distance of restaurants, coffee shops, and souvenir shopping. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone. ",5,2018,07,24
115,Very Happy,"Bloomsbury is top notch, Food was really good it is not cheap but excellent quality, Drinks also on the pricey but the service was 1st class, real place if you looking for a bit of pampering. Great location near Oxford street and 15 minutes to Covent Garden",5,2018,07,24
115,"Gorgeous, comfortable, quiet hotel","I stayed four nights at The Bloomsbury, and wouldn't hesitate to stay again! The hotel itself is gorgeous - from the gracious sitting room on the ground floor to the very comfortable bedrooms. Everything feels luxurious and beautifully designed. The Coral Room is a glamorous spot for a cocktail at the end of the day, with great drinks and attentive staff. The rooms are quiet and very comfortable, with Nespresso machine, tea & coffee, outlets for several different regions. And the location is very central, with nearby access to the Tube at Tottenham Court Road. A lot of the guests seemed to be there on vacation, but this was a perfect place to stay for my business trip. Already looking forward to scheduling a return trip!",5,2018,07,24
115,"Great hotel, less then great front desk.","Great location in the Theatre District - walking distance to lots of great restaurants, etc. Room size would have been fine if it had not been crammed with furniture. The terrace restaurant is lovely, service was great and we had a great meal. Hotel front desk was less then helpful and a bit rude.",3,2018,07,23
115,Great hotel!,"We just returned from a stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel. It is in the Theatre District in London, and walking distance from the British Museum. The hotel is beautiful and they take great care to make sure you are well cared for when you are their guest. The staff is excellent...each person we encountered was kind, helpful, and caring. Our room was a great size, especially for Europe with all the amenities we needed. The bathroom was cozy, but it was well decorated and functional. The breakfast each day was excellent!! I ordered fresh eggs and would get fruit and cheese or yogurt from the buffet. It was really well done. The Coral Room Bar does an excellent job of giving you a nice place to relax before dinner, and the patio for dinner is a wonderful experience. It is located near the Tottenham Court Underground station which made it very easy to get around the city. I would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2018,07,22
115,A top-notch hotel in every way,"A centrally-located hotel in a beautiful classic building, with large well-appointed rooms.  A fabulous breakfast to begin the day, excellent restaurants and two outstanding bars to end it.  The service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was always welcoming and elegant.",5,2018,07,21
115,Exquisite stay,"I booked a room at this hotel as a birthday treat for my partner. At the time of booking I mentioned this. On arrival  we were told our signature suit (i think we may have been upgraded!) wasn't quite ready, but this didn't matter as we were off to see the matinee showing of A Bat Out Of Hell at the dominion theatre just next door. On arriving back from the show our room was ready and waiting for us was a happy birthday balloon, a nice smelling candle as a gift and a slice of carrot cake with a card signed by Sebastian ( the nice concierge is spoke to when booking). 
As you can see from the pictures our room was fabulous and had a lovely roll to bath and giant bathroom with waterfall shower too. 
We had drinks in the Coral Bar, which had a lovely atmosphere, and the breakfast was also very nice! 
It was a real shame that we were only there for one night as a birthday treat as I would have loved to have been able to afford to stay longer!! 
Both me and my partner really enjoyed our stay in the lap of luxury and would definitely recommend this hotel!!",5,2018,07,21
115,We found a new headquarters in London!,"Had a fabulous four-night stay at the Bloomsbury.  From now on, when we come to London, this is where we will stay.  Everything was exceptional.  Great staff, superior room and food.  If there are any knocks, it would be more television selections, and the front desk should b e able to make change.  I wanted to break a 20-pound bill, but all they had was 20, 1-pound coins.  A bit heavy to carry in one's pocket.  These are minor details, however.  We will stay again.",5,2018,07,21
115,Best Staff in London,"My wife and I just spent a week here with 2 kids (ages 6 & 8) in the Family Room. Beautiful hotel, charming, great location, amazing bar - and the staff were quite simply the best in London. By week’s end it truly felt like saying goodbye to long-lost family. 

Ionut, Marina, and Victor were superb - going out of their way every day to make sure everything was perfect for the entire family. And every single member of the staff was equally exceptional. 

Most hotels are designed solely as a place to stay. The Bloomsbury is one that will stay with you. We can’t wait to return.",5,2018,07,21
115,Beautiful Hotel ,"What a find this place was, from the moment we stepped out of the cab we were treated to a real luxury experience. The hotel is beautiful and on entering through the Coral Bar we felt compelled to stop and try the cocktails. The waiter service was exceptional and really attentive. Our room was a deluxe double and more than adequate for the two of us. The decor was lovely and everywhere was spotlessly clean.
Loved the toiletries, they smelt amazing. 
The location is also ideal, especially for theatre goers. Everything is within a reasonable walking distance with some theatres right on the doorstep. Lots of great places to eat nearby and although I would recommend the hotel terrace for breakfast I would also give the Caf across the road a try.
The whole experience was great, beautiful hotel with fantastic customer service. We’ll be back next year.",5,2018,07,21
115,A classy London gem,"Thiis recently redecorated hotel caught my eye with its stunning online photos of its bar, restaurant, terrace and lounge areas.  I love a hotel that offers smart and stylish areas like this. The decor in the Coral Room is so fabulous! The staff was top notch and friendly. The hotel's location is right near the British museum and quite central to many other key London destinations.  We dined  and drank in all the hotel bars and restaurants and give them all high marks.  We were there for 6 nights and requested a room change to a room with a better view and the hotel handled this very efficiently for us. ",5,2018,07,20
115,Charming Upscale Hotel,"The Bloomsbury exceeded our expectations.  The staff were wonderful and made our stay memorable.  Our room was clean and comfortable and large for a London accommodation.  The Dalloway Terrace restaurant is so pretty and the food was wonderful.  We ate there only one evening, but wish we ate there more!  However, there were other wonderful restaurants within walking distance of the hotel as well.  We did have breakfast there every morning which was included in our package and was wonderful as well.  The Coral Room Bar and Bloomsbury Club Bar were both great. The hotel is also a minute away from the Tube but yet tucked away on a relatively quiet street.  I would highly recommend The Bloomsbury!",5,2018,07,20
115,The Bloomsbury  -parsons,"This was the best hotel we have stayed in London the service was exceptional and was all you should expect from a fine hotel we  would highly recommend this. 
The owners have obviously spent a lot of money refurbishing this hotel and it was very tastefully done",5,2018,07,18
115,Lovely night in London,"Just returned home after an overnight stay at The Bloomsbury for my birthday. The hotel was fabulous! Check in wasn't until 2pm but we arrived at 9am after taking an early train from Newcastle as we wanted to spend the day in London. We were hoping to drop our bags off but our room was ready so they allowed us to check in early, not only that but we were given a free upgrade to a suite! 
The room itself was gorgeous, done to an impeccably high standard & spotlessly clean. 
All of the staff were lovely, could not have done anymore for us - so impressed by the level of customer service! 
We had drinks in The Coral Room on the night, yummy cocktails & fantastic service yet again! 
Breakfast was included with our rate & I couldn't fault it!
Thank you so much to all of the lovely staff who made our stay so special - I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone! So luxurious yet welcoming at the same time... Just fabulous! 
",5,2018,07,15
115,Great Location with Great Style,"The Bloomsbury is a great hotel in central London.

The location is superb. Close to the Tottenham metro station and Charlotte Street, which has a ton of restaurants to choose from.

As soon as you walk in you feel welcomed. The reception area is small and very cozy.

The stairs at the entrance aren't very nice if you have a lot of heavy luggage like we did (I did not look / find a lift/elevator).

The ""living room"" of the reception is cozy with a fireplace going almost all the time, it made it for a great atmosphere, like being home but away from home.

We stayed at a junior suite and got upgraded to a luxury suite. The suite was big and the bathroom amazing! The only complaint is that the shower does not have a door so for kids, with the ar conditioning, it gets a little cold.

The staff was amazing. I have to give a big big thanks to Brian Murphy (Head Concierge). He was very helpful prior to our arrival. We exchanged quite a few emails and he was always quick to reply and very helpful. As a matter of fact, every one at the concierge desk were great. Every day they helped me with attractions tips and were very patient explaining everything. Murat always greeted us with a smile and was very helpful.
I do have to mention ""JC"". When we were checking out, he made sure we were going to miss this place. He was very kind providing us with some coffee and a snack ""for the road"". To me the staff did a great job making us feel comfortable during our stay.

One area that I think it can improve is the breakfast buffet. It is very limited for 19 pounds. That was a downer because staying at such a nice place, everything needs to be at the same level.

Overall I do recommend this hotel. Great location and amazing staff.

If this helped ...... give it a vote.",4,2018,07,14
115,English-style experience in the right style,"There’s something genuinely British in the accomodation experience I’ve had at The Bloomsbury London during a recent business trip in which I chose it for a 2 night stay. Here is why I loved it so much:

Location wise, the hotel is classically placed a minute away from Tottenham court road station, turning it into highly accessible and even though the intersection of Oxford/Tottenham is quite a hectic spot, the hotel’s location is kind of behind so it maintains the the quiet and calm of a small hood rather than a loud city center. 

The design of the hotel is chic and contemporary, with a set of beautifully set spaces like the sitting room & the bar - all with vibrant wallpapers and speciala pieces of furniture. I loved it.

No doubt the hotel puts high emphasis on high levels of service and the cleaning service of the room is exceptionally done twice a day. The concierge and breakfast team are extremely kind and efficient. However, I do have to note that the reception team and the ordering team (on the phone/email) were a bit harder to communicate with: waiting times for email replies took long several days and issues that were agreed upon during order placement were not communicated to the front desk; it seems as though within the hotel itself, the service is really good - but something in its connection to the reservation center decreases the overall experience.

I really loved the option to have breakfast at the room as opposed to going down to the dining room, as well as the hotel’s sensitivity to its digital guests with mindful sets of USB ports everywhere in the room. The Nespresso machine also makes morning wake ups and evening times so much more pleasant.

The Bloomsbury is the kind of hotel you want to return to, and I will. Thank you!",5,2018,07,13
115,Best hotel ever!,"I cannot express how wonderful the Bloomsbury Hotel is. The rooms are lovely, the location is perfect and close to the tube and theater. But more importantly, the staff is kind and attentive. We stayed for a week and they always acknowledged us, addressed us by name and made sure we were well taken care of. The art deco bar and artisan drinks were the perfect place to relax at the end of the day. Comfy beds! I can't wait to go back!",5,2018,07,12
115,An Extremely Special London Hotel,"It is impossible to praise The Bloomsbury highly enough. The perfect location for visiting central London,this hotel is stylish and sophisticated with thoughtful attention to detail in every way. Without exception, every member of staff treated us with the utmost help, consideration and charm - nothing was too much trouble. The building has a fascinating history which is cleverly and tastefully woven into the ambience of the hotel. Cocktails in the stunning Coral bar were spectacular and breakfast in the restaurant offered a wide range which was freshly prepared and delicious. A hotel not to be missed if you want a first class stay.

115,Weekend visit,"Smallish rooms, but that's the capital - otherwise, well appointed, clean and tastefully decorated.  We didn't stay for drinks or breakfast, but the building seemed nicely fitted out and the staff were all very friendly.  Couldn't fault it.",4,2018,07,10
115,Excellent customer service,"Our week long stay was booked and prepaid through a third party (Tablet Hotels) and it somehow became confused such that we wound up with two rooms (instead of one) and were pre-charged for BOTH these rooms prior to arrival.  The issue was discovered upon check-in, so most likely the hotel lost revenue for one or more nights due to the extra room reserved for us.  Tablet wanted to pin the blame on us, and aggressively pursued us to pay for both rooms, finally settling on a “credit” for six nights stay that they would allow us to use in the next 12 months.  Fortunately, management personnel at the Hotel (in particular Camille Bourit) saw the injustice in this, and promptly refunded us the $2000+ charge on their own accord.  Not sure how they settled with Tablet, but most likely it was a big hassle for them.  I feel that we were treated with the utmost respect and thoughtfulness by the Hotel, and plan to stay there again...which by the way IS NO BURDEN as it is a lovely hotel, well located, with super friendly staff all around!",5,2018,07,10
115,A pleasant one night stay,Hotel is nicely appointed.  The room was very clean with a well-appointed bathroom although small.  Perfectly adequate for a short stay. Very convenient for the British Museum and there's lots to explore in the area.,5,2018,07,09
115,Excellent hotel,"Stayed in Room 514 which was excellent, spacious room with large bathroom all filled with natural light.  

Only queries were we wanted an early check-in as we arrived at 6am after a 22 hour flight.  Reception confirmed via email they could not guarantee same, this gave us some hope it might be available.  However, upon arrival we were promptly advised the Hotel was full which is typical for this time of year - it would have enabled us to plan our journey if this advice was provided prior to our arrival.

There was also a difference between the high service delivery of the Hotel staff compared with the hotels restaurant The Dalloway, for example, guests have no priority, even for a seating area where no reservations are possible.

Concierge seemed to give rehearsed recommendations irrespective of context, for example, a Pub full of ‘lads’ drinking pints on a Friday night cheering England in the World Cup was the recommendation for a family dinner.

The above observations are all I could fault the Bloomsbury- all else was efficient, professional and friendly and we will definitely return !",4,2018,07,07
115,Great hotel in a great location,Very charming hotel located just blocks from Soho and Coven Garden. Close to most of the theaters in London. The bar was also a lot of fun with great drinks (try the gin lane). can't wait to stay there next time we are in London. I would highly recommend.,5,2018,07,06
115,I’ll definitely stay here again,"What a cool vibe.  Yes, arriving at midnight I had a few minutes of trouble finding the side-street entrance, but as soon as I did and entered the hotel I knew it was going to be a cool place to stay.

It’s in a perfect location - lots of dining options nearby, although the food at the hotel is really good.  Room service was very quick and delicious upon my late-night arrival, and the breakfast each morning was quite a spread.  Definitely have drinks at the bar too - it’s a hip scene and lively space.

The staff all around was really nice.

If you care about room size this may not be the place for you, but if you’re not high maintenance about the space where you sleep then the small area won’t bother you.  It was clean and modern with a fine size bathroom as well.

I hope business brings me back to London soon so I can stay at The Bloomsbury again.",4,2018,07,06
115,Excellent Location near the Theatre!,"My husband and I stayed at The Bloomsbury for 1 night as we had a special evening planned to see a show at the nearby Dominion theatre. We checked in on time at 3pm and they showed us to our room where I was pleasantly surprised by the birthday sweets they left on the table along with a kind birthday message! (My husband did notify them in advance that we would be celebrating a birthday). 
The room was clean, had all of the up-to-date amenities and the bed was incredibly comfortable. The location was also perfect for us as we managed to go out for a very nice dinner nearby before heading to our evening show.  All within very short walking distance.  Room service was also quick when we called down to order more pillows.  Overall I had the most enjoyable stay at this hotel and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind spending a bit more on their accommodation for a clean, decent room.",4,2018,07,04
115,Nice Hotel - Pity About The Room Size.,"We stayed here for 5 nights starting 30 May. Arrival is complicated but the fact that the entry is at the side of the street with no vehicle access. Staff are very enthusiastic and friendly. Breakfast is excellent but, oh dear, the rooms are just too small. 
My daughter and her partner joined us a couple of days later and their room was simply tiny and very uncomfortable. The excuse, of course, is that all hotel rooms in London are small, but this issue really lets the Bloomsbury down.
That said, it is very well-located for the British Museum.",3,2018,07,03
115,Wonderful hotel the second time around!,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury for 6 nights in June 2018 - four years after our first visit. Happy to say that the room (this time 623) was again spacious and very comfortable. There were many changes though that were equally fine - a new restaurant (Dalloway Terrace) where we enjoyed afternoon tea. And an outstanding bar called the Bloomsbury Club, with a 1920s vibe and inventive cocktails. The hotel also offered a free guided tour of the Bloomsbury neighborhood on Saturday which was  great fun. The hotel staff was friendly and responsive. And the location is excellent for theatre, transportation, and the British Museum. Will stay there next time we are in London.",5,2018,07,02
115,Disappointing,The hotel is amazing. But for £254 for the room I can’t help but say I was disappointed and angry with the ‘shoebox’ room hardly the luxury advertised and nothing compared to somewhere like the Hoxton. So yeah hotel was great but the room itself was tiny and had marks on the wall and I just felt I would rather have spent my money elsewhere,3,2018,07,01
115,"Great location, friendly staff","We stayed here for one night to give our Australian friend the opportunity to see a bit of London. It is well placed for theatreland which is one reason why we chose this hotel. The reception staff were very helpful as our room was ready early so we could do a quick change, get in a taxi for ‘afternoon tea at the Ritz’. The concierge, the doormen were all very helpful in acquiring taxis for us. Unfortunately the traffic was gridlocked due to road closures & construction work so we had to allow extra time to get around. Rooms were ok but a fire alarm call at 6.20 was not funny. After, we sat in the breakfast room in our dressing gowns having tea until the lifts were working again. Our rooms were on the 7th floor! Overall it is a great hotel, friendly service from all staff. Would stay there again if we were in London.",5,2018,07,01
115,EVENT ORGANISER,"We organised an event for 85 people here recently and from the moment we made the initial enquiry 6 months ago right up to the night of the event the whole process went smoothly.  The reservations team led by Georgia  Lewis-Smith were professional to deal with and communicated clearly with us of our next steps to help with decision making.  All of the chargers were outlined clearly and booking and cancellations dates were broken down simply on a chart.   At no time were there any grey areas regarding our event and everything was covered with no stone left unturned.  Our meetings at the hotel were a joy, just to sit in the Coral Bar is a treat!  We were always offered complimentary tea/coffee at our meetings, small gesture but a grateful one.  The location is ideal for anyone working in London to get to our event as it is only a couple of minutes walk from Tottenham Court Road tube.

On the evening of the event our manager for the night looked after us beautifully making sure he was always available and in sight (but not intrusive) so any issues could be smoothed over promptly.  The waiting staff for the evening were very professional and well trained. The food was excellent and we received many compliments from our guests there as it appeared to be a surprise that you can go to a London Event and receive nice food too!.  

Overall a fantastic experience and we would highly recommend this hotel for an event of this size.  We have already booked the lovely Queen Mary room again for next year. 

Well done The Bloomsbury!",5,2018,06,28
115,Microcosiom of Britian,"The atmosphere is dignified but warm and cordial.  The staff shows themselves to be anxious to assist and make you comfortable.  Illustration: Mr. Jero Pineiro, Guest Relations Manager, escorted us to the street to show us exactly where the British Museum is. (It is close to the hotel.} The hotel room was attractive, large enough for two people and spotless.  Breakfast  buffet was extraordinary in variety and quality.  Further, we could order anything we did not see.  I ordered oatmeal which came promptly and was delicious. The hotel is centrally located and a 3 minute walk from the Tottenheim Court Road station. When you find a hotel that goes beyond your need, why look for another?  This is THE place.",5,2018,06,27
115,Great stay - highly recommended!,"Thank you Bloomsbury Hotel for a most enjoyable stay! We loved the room, the courtyard restaurant and of course the Coral Room Bar. Special mention goes to Ivan and Gabriele for being very thoughtful, friendly and accommodating!",5,2018,06,27
115,Wedding anniversary,Another superb stay at this fantastic hotel yet again it was a pleasure to be back thanks to Sebastian Annandale and has fabulous staff had a lovely room on the 6th floor for our anniversary with several visits to the new coral lounge a must visit and it has a great atmosphere with live jazz music also the down stairs bar were we were welcomed by our favorite bar man Sebastian still makeing us great cocktails afyer all these years of visiting this lovely boutique hotel also like to mention ionut and Mariana in the breakfast resturant always welcome guests with a smile and the breakfast is awesome lots to chose from and a buffet at weekends again thanks to Sebastian Annandale  and all  the great staff here back again in November for what will be another  fabulous stay 5 star service from everyone to the bar staff resturant staff and the front desk staff  👍😀,5,2018,06,27
115,Exceptional hotel,"This is the 5th time I have chosen to stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel. As an international visitor (from Australia) I continue to choose to stay at this hotel because of the quality of the facilities, the outstanding service, the ideal location and the friendliness of staff. The rooms are beautiful. Wonderful bedding. Free internet. Quiet. The hotel bar and restaurants are exceptional, with a sophisticated yet welcoming and relaxing ambience. I particularly appreciate the hotel's curation of its history - through the library, chapel and the little books in our room - one on the history of the hotel and the other an anthology of poetry associated with the hotel. ",5,2018,06,26
115,Lovely hotel with nice rooms and must-see Coral Room Bar,"Stayed for one night whilst we visited the Dominion Theatre which is next door.
The hotel looks impressive with a nice double-staircase up to the front of the building which is actually the bar area.  A separate stair case at the side is the closest entrance to reception, it is decorated with bushes and trees in pots: rather nice.
Our room wasn't huge, but it was comfortable and nicely appointed, we got a voucher for a complementary cocktail: so we made our way to the Coral Room bar at the front of the hotel.  The bar has 1920's inspired decorations is a lovely location and served excellent cocktail, so good we called back later for a second round. 
Overall lovely hotel and a fantastic bar - well worth a visit.",5,2018,06,25
115,"Nice room, international staff","We stayed here because it was in walking distance to Covent Garden and Soho... and 2 minutes from the tube. It was perfect hideaway after the craziness of a day wandering through  London. The bar is warm and inviting (serves some good bar food too). Rooms are spacious. All in all a great time (Thanks Ivan) with helpful staff.
Ask for a high floor room facing Great Russell St. And don't pass by the excellent Indian restaurant just outside the hotel.

115,Outstanding Service From Alexia Moros and her events team,"I am the London Director for the British Irish Chamber Of Commerce and used this venue recently for a prestigious summer reception with 70-80 VIP guests. Alexia Moros and her colleagues were outstanding from start to finish and helped me to plan and execute my event and ensure all of my guests were happy with great dedication and superb attention to detail, I was super happy with the experience and cannot praise her and the rest of the team at The Bloomsbury highly enough. David O'Reilly",5,2018,06,22
115,Great Location ,"My wife and I stayed here for two nights during the royal wedding weekend. The hotel is in an excellent location, 30 seconds from Tottenham Court Road tube station and a 5 min walk from the British museum. The room was a good size and furnished nicely. The staff were very friendly. We would recommend staying here.  ",5,2018,06,21
115,Beautiful property superb customer service,Such a beautiful hotel in a great location and full of history. The staff at all levels authentically cared about making our stay memorable - special mention to Estelita and Ionut. Food was excellent.,5,2018,06,20
115,Great location but very small,"The hotel is in a great location for exploring London. Lovely cosy rooms with all the amenities you need. We were especially happy to see there was an iron in the room as it’s rare in hotels, despite being a necessity for travellers. Only thing is the rooms and bathrooms are very small, even the bed is tiny, my husbands feet were hanging off the edge. Highly recommend the Coral Room for cocktails and Dalloway Terrace for breakfast ",4,2018,06,19
115,Amazing Hotel and staff,"We only stayed one night in this wonderful hotel , and didn't really make full use of all the facilities on offer , as we had an action packed schedule , but from first setting foot on the stairs up to the entrance to leaving we were treated like Royalty .
All the staff were extremely helpful polite and nothing was too much trouble. The room was lovely with excellent facilities spotlessly clean and very comfortable bed.
We had breakfast in bed as it was our anniversary , and champagne flowers and chocolate strawberries were delivered with a personal card from Camille .Wish we could have stayed longer , would thoroughly recommend to anyone looking for a London hotel .We will definitely be back next time we visit London .",5,2018,06,19
115,Love this hotel.,"Stylish, centrally located, new reno of lobby areas very nice. Attentive staff. Sent up tea service immediately,  once when I arrived with a terrible flu and a talk to give the next day.  lovely  bar and restaurant. Many hotels in Bloomsbury but this is the one. ",5,2018,06,18
115,"Consistently high standard, a pleasure to stay at the Bloomsbury.","Third stay here. The rooms are clean and well maintained, the food at the Dalloway Terrace is very nice, service is attentive in all parts of the hotel. The new Coral room was lovely, but could do with some more seating.

Best of all is the bar downstairs... consummate professional service, fantastic cocktails prepared with a passion by a friendly team.

The reason we keep coming back is the price, quality and location, which makes getting anywhere in central London a breeze.",5,2018,06,16
115,"Excellent Staff, location, service","Very welcoming and friendly staff who always try to find a solution to any problem. Comfortable rooms and great location. Very nice terrace for dinner.
The only minus was the shower that did not provide a hand shower.",5,2018,06,16
115,Five star hotel with four star price in the heart of London ,"I do stay in quite a few reasonable hotels, and in this price range they are normally rated 4 stars, the Bloomsbury is different though. It’s a great value largeish boutique Art Deco style hotel very convenient for the Dominion theatre and Oxford st. The door staff are smart and attentive, and check in was quick and efficient. We were in room 707, fairly small but perfectly formed. Some lovely decor such as the large mirror, also a fully tiled bathroom (with good quality provisions). The air con was easy to use and efficient (not often you can say that!) The safe was also easy to use and there was a flat screen wall mounted smart tv. Slippers and robes were provided. Not only was there a nespresso machine, but also an excellently stocked beverage tray too, which would please the most catholic tastes. There was also a turn down service, chocolates and bottled water as you would expect in a pricey five star establishment. The bed was comfy as was the bedding. 
You don’t get many hotels with books about their history and also poetry written about them in your room! 
The public rooms were also a cut above the usual. The Art Deco bar was a fantastic place to enjoy a post show G & T. Smart friendly and knowledgeable bar staff, and plenty of delicious snacks. Prices no higher than bog standard hotel bars in the capital too. The sitting room and the Dalloway Terrace were also most pleasing. I’ll definitely be staying here again if I’m in this part of town. 

",5,2018,06,15
115,Boutique hotel,"Stayed here a couple weeks ago with my partner and we both thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the hotel and London!
Their bar was decorated very well with a cool vibrant yet vintage style. As well as the flower restaurant which was really good and the chicken was great!

Their were a couple minor issues with the room such as the the drainage but it’s expected with an old building, but whenever I spoke to either receptionist, Alma and Tringa they were very helpful. 

Overall great stay. Will retun in future.",5,2018,06,15
115,Highly recommended,My wife and I stayed at the Bloomsbury for just one night as a birthday treat. We were upgraded to a larger room which was a lovely surprise. Friendly staff and even when small things were forgotten they were put right quickly and with a smile. We had a great time and will be returning. A comfortable bolthole in the hurly burly of London.,5,2018,06,15
115,Would have been 5 stars if not for a bad first impression,"The room and location are lovely, but we had an awkward experience at check-in. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived, so the host offered us some coffee while we waited. The timing worked out that our room was ready before the coffee arrived, so she said she'll just have the coffee sent up to our room. It arrived 5 minutes later, along with a bill of 10 pounds! I was caught off guard and signed off, but that's just wrong. You don't offer coffee as a courtesy without any indication that there will be a charge for it. The coffee was clearly offered as a courtesy while we waited for our room impression. It wasn't ever a request on our part. Not a good first impression. We definitely felt duped.",3,2018,06,14
115,Loved every minute.,"Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Bloomsbury and could not have enjoyed ourselves more. The hotel was centrally located, but still peaceful and quiet. The room was great, but what really made the stay was the staff. 

Kevin and Rusty from the Coral Room are our absolute FAVORITES and kept us entertained throughout our trip. Kevin went above and beyond by showing us to the Bloomsbury Club and the amazing Jazz music it had, helping us make a reservation for tea and he even made a reservation for us at a restaurant he recommended. Rusty was wonderful and served great drinks and went above and beyond with service. 

My friend and I went for a getaway to celebrate 5 years in business and we came back so in love with this hotel that we can't wait to bring our friends and families back. This was my 7th trip to London and I've never taken the time to review my accommodations until now. Loved this hotel and can't wait to visit again.",5,2018,06,13
115,Well located,Very located right in the heart of London. but still very quiet. Stayed here for the first time on a business trip and didn't regret it. Excellent attention from the staff made everything perfect. Hope to come again !,5,2018,06,13
115,Incredible experience,"I recently had my entire team stay at the Bloomsbury for business in London. It was our first time at the hotel and we took over 8 rooms across a week and our experience was fantastic. Friendly staff that took an effort to know us and service and attention that was a reminder of why independent hotels are sometimes the best experience you can have while traveling.
Cocktails in the Coral Room were amazing and breakfast was lovely. While we have typically preferred the Rosewood, I think we found our new home in London.",5,2018,06,12
115,Recommend. Would Visit Again.,"Centrally located to a lot of the sites to see in London, but still far enough away from the hustle and bustle, The Bloomsbury offers first rate service to its guests. We enjoyed our stay. Don't miss the breakfasts or the bars within the hotel.",5,2018,06,11
115,Still an excellent hotel,"Been a few years since last here, and the has been a face lift for the property.
This is an excellent location, close to most things with 2 tube stations nearby.
Rooms are variable but comfortable. Beds were very good.
Bathroom in our room was OK but, like some older buildings, drainage was not great.
Good A/C. Fast solid wifi.
Excellent staff at all levels.

I met very helpful staff, especially Kinga  and Estelita. Stunning food, worth its price. Lovely place, tasty food and great service.",5,2018,06,10
115,A great hotel,"This is a great hotel, excellent location, fantastic staff, friendly atmosphere. Our room a little bit small and dark, however, on our request was changed without problem. The  fashionabel coral bar an unforgettable experience and breakfast not to top. Hotel staff competent, always attentive, friendly. For all staff members to mention the breakfast team: Estelita, Maria, Victor, Ionut. Thank you so much, like to meet you next time.",5,2018,06,10
115,Great location,"Fantastic location, the staff are brilliant , rooms ok at the cheaper end we paid £200 for one night , got a small room, shower pressure not great. Comfortable but very hot .There was a cupboard that went behind the shower , should have been locked but I pulled it open and it had no floor and gave access to pipes , glad we had no kids or this would be an issue . 
Wouldn’t rave about the room but location was good very close to the top of Tottenham Court Road",3,2018,06,10

115,Short break,Excellent hotel. Lovely caring helpful staff Spotless spacious comfortable room Fantastic choice of food for breakfast to suit all tastes Ideal location to visit shows and all the usual sights of the city ,5,2018,06,09
115,Great location good staff ,"Stayed here for long weekend in London.  Location is great you can easily walk to oxford street, the national art gallery, Covent garden and theatre district.   Rooms : Small but well equipped - request  a room with Windows facing the street you will gain light and it’s not a particularly noisy area. Hotel facilities old architecture brought to life with lots of colour and little spaces to sit and enjoy.  Restaurant was a bit pricey but lovely only trouble is it’s popular with the trendy London crowd so best to book ahead if you want to dine and be prepared for being surrounded by tables of young people taking lots of selfies to get the right shot against the flower wall.  I like people watching so it’s a bit of fun.   Parts of the hotel need better ventilation but air conditioning in rooms work well.  $$ it’s a bit pricey for what you get but it’s London and staff are very helpful and that make a difference. would we stay again - most likely for position and Service
Thanks Bloomsbury Team",4,2018,06,05
115,Fabulous Stay,"We’ve had a fabulous stay. Arrived early, but were shown to our room immediately (even though we hadn’t specifically requested an early check in). We’d been upgraded and there was a Happy Birthday card and complimentary chocolate cake awaiting us (it was my husband’s 70th Birthday the day we arrived).  Lovely touch! 
We didn’t have dinner at the hotel, but were told by others it was delicious. I’m sure it was because breakfast and lunch, which we did sample, were both very good. Breakfast buffet was outstanding with freshly cooked eggs to order. 
Service was impeccable- attentive, yet discreet. Can’t fault this hotel. Very good value for money, considering it’s central location. 
Room was extremely comfortable with all the facilities one would expect, and more. Tea and coffee facilities replenished whenever we were out. Room serviced and bed turned down in the evening. Lovely comfortable bed too!  
Made my husband’s birthday celebrations perfect!

115,The Bloomsbury Hotel,We stayed at three hotels in the area and this by far was the best. The scale of the hotel feels very comfortable and the staffing was perfect. We dined outside at the Mrs. Dalloway and the food was delicious. We were part of a larger group and participated in a group evening in The Library. Drinks and food were excellent. A definite place to stay if you are headed to the Bloomsbury neighborhood. ,5,2018,05,30
115,Fabulous service and great drinks!,"Had a wonderful experience at the coral rooms, our bartender Stefan made us drinks based on our preferences and was very attentive - thank you! Also had dinner at Dalloway Terrace, the setting was lovely and the food was perfect!",5,2018,05,29
115,very nice hotel at excellent location,"Rooms not too small, excellent service in general, incredibly good location, nice terrace to relax in spring/summer and I especially appreciated the variety of electrical outlets in the room to charge all the different devices. It is a fair price for a hotel in London - I've stayed in more expensive and far less confortable hotels in London.",5,2018,05,29
115,Tiny Jewel,"We stayed here as we wanted to be close to the British Museum, which is only about a block or two up the street.  It turned out to be a perfect location, as we could easily walk all around the Bloomsbury, Russell Square, Soho and theater district areas.  There are many great pubs and other restaurants within easy walking distance.  The hotel staff were terrific in all respects - friendly and helpful at all times.  The rooms are comfortable and quiet, but small, and the bathrooms are tiny.  We joked that the restroom on the airplane flying over had more room, but we really didn't mind.  All in all, a very positive experience and we would stay here again.",5,2018,05,29
115,Lovely Weekend,"We have just returned from 2 nights at The Bloomsbury and had a very good stay.  We booked a Junior Suite (703) which was nicely refurbished with good quality bed linens and china for the tea/coffee making facilities.  Our only negative comment is that the bathroom door needs to be not quite so see-through to save any embarassment to yourself or your partner!

Staff as always went above and beyond to make our stay special.

Names of particular note are - Joel in the Coral Bar.  He and my husband always get onto the subject of  football when we stay so there is a little bit of banter going on.

-Maria and the other Lovely Lady at breakfast who remember us every time by name which is appreciated. (Sorry I don't remember your full names as I mislaid the card you gave us).

This was our first visit since the refurbishment and I must admit I'm not too sure about the bright coral paint over the lovely wood panelling in what used to be the reception area.  The new reception is beautifully decorated, if a little smaller than the original reception.

We are looking forward to another visit hopefully soon.",5,2018,05,29
115,"Good hotel, great Location","Nice rooms but on the small side, generous supply of Nespresso and cookies in each room, service is top (the „breakfast-crew“ Victor, Estelita, Kinga, Ionut and Marina were really remarkably friendly and attentive), breakfast is top (unexpected wide range of choice, very tasty).

115,Location,"Tottenham Court Road underground station is very close by making travel about London very convenient from this hotel. It is in walking distance of much of central London ( the shops of Oxford St, many theatres, the British Museum, major parts of the University of London, Soho with its restaurants and nightcubls, the restaurants and shops of Covent Garden, and much more). The hotel is comfortable with nice rooms and amenities, although the lobby and corridors are rather cramped and shut-in feeling. It has a trendy new bar which is very attractive and a nice older bar with an outside area in the basement. The food in the restaurant is very good, although a bit pricey, and the buffet breakfast is good but nothing special. The Dalloway restaurant looks great, but it is housed in an outside terrace which has been ""winterized"" : but beware of sitting near the ""windows"" if the weather is at all chilly. We found it unbearably cold one evening in early May and had to suffer thru it until another spot became available to move to. One curious feature of the placement of this hotel is that its main entrance faces an ugly nearby wall (as do many of the rooms) so that what should be quite a gracious entrance suffers from a very peculiar location. No matter : overall this is a pleasant and comfortable hotel, with helpful and welcoming staff, and a great location.",4,2018,05,23
115,"Super lounge renovation, but small rooms & terrible front desk staff","The Bloomsbury is in an excellent, central area of London and close to a tube station. The bar, restaurant and lounge have been renovated & are fantastic. The corridors are narrow, as they usually are in old hotels, and the rooms are small. Staff at the front desk are untrained, rude and unhelpful. When I asked a question I was referred to the concierge with a dismissive wave of the hand. I ran around looking for the concierge's desk. Later I found that the concierge's desk was located right next to the front desk. At 6PM our room was not made up. When I told the person  at the front desk, she looked at me disdainfully & said, ""Do you mean your room has not been CLEANED?"" After waiting an hour for the maid, I called housekeeping & they sent a maid a few minutes later. We left the hotel at 4AM to catch an early flight. The person at the front desk glanced up & didn't say a word (we had paid the night before) - didn't ask how our stay was, or whether we had transportation. Suggest you go to the Bloomsbury for a drink so you can admire the bar area and see the lounge, then check in to another hotel.",3,2018,05,23
115,Great place to stay in London,"My wife and I recently stayed here and it was a wonderful expierence. The hotel is a great mix of classic design with a modern twist. If you are someone who loves thoughtful design and delicious food, this is the place for you. 

The staff was super friendly and helpful. Everyone there is willing to help you with any need, such as Ivan, who offered us places to visit, eat, and even how to get there.

We will be back!",5,2018,05,22
115,Third time and counting - the only place I'll stay in London,"Everything about this hotel is great - the location, the drinks, the rooms and especially the staff. The staff makes all the difference in the world - we had especially great service again this time - thanks to Laura, Brian and Attila for all the help and extra attention! A mark of a great hotel is how they treat their guests, especially the younger ones. My three year old son had a great time and has now asked me twice to go back to his ""hotel home."" 

Thanks again for a great visit - we hope to be back again soon!",5,2018,05,22
115,My third stay in a year and it did not disappoint,"This was my third stay at the Bloomsbury in a year and once again it did not disappoint. The location is great, the staff always goes above and beyond to make sure your stay is perfect and the bars/dining on site can't be beat. ",5,2018,05,21
115,Amazing stay  ,"Would give a 6 if I could.
A cozy, beautiful boutique hotel, very well located (10-15 minutes walk from Covent Garden/the Soho/Piccadilly), with Tottenham tube stop just around the corner.  
Rooms are small but not too much (we had the regular room and it was perfectly fine for me and my daughter). 
They also have a very good restaurant, with tasty contemporary food and relaxing atmosphere.
Besides the beauty of the hotel itself, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Maria, Marina and Victor from the breakfast staff actually remembered our names and preferences, which made us feel  at home. 
Ivan the concierge was adorable, the kindest we ever ran into. Helped us with any question or problem we encountered, always with a smile and readiness to assist. 
Will be happy to stay here again next time in London!!!",5,2018,05,21
115,Felt Like Home,"My wife and I just spent a week are The Bloomsbury Hotel in London. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. The room was very nice and large by European standards. The Dallowau Terrace is an excellent restaurant. But to us the defining factor is the staff. Everyone we encountered was so passionate about hospitality and went out of their way to ensure that our visit would be great and that our needs were met. The location can't be neat. A short walk to the tube, the British Museum, Oxford  Street, the theatre district. When I titled this review, I have it that name because when we returned each evening, we did feel like we were going home. Am planning another visit next year.",5,2018,05,21
115,Our favorite!,"This is our 3rd stay at The Bloomsbury.  It never fails to disappoint.  Walking distance to shopping, theather, transportation and dining.  Love the new Coral Bar.  Very accomodating wait staff and the food, as always is impeccable.",5,2018,05,20
115,50th birthday celebration,"Our stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel was wonderful in every way! 
The service, food and room were superb. The staff went out of their way to accommodate us. We drank cockatails in the bar and ate in the restaurant. All of this making a very memorable 50th birthday. 
We will definitely return in the future.",5,2018,05,16
115,Family Trip made special,"Just back from an amazing weekend in The Bloomsbury Hotel. What a gorgeous hotel. Firstly the location is just spot on, so close to the tube. Within a stones throw to Oxford Street but located on a very quiet street and set in off the road. The staff couldn’t have been more friendly and helpful. A big thumbs up from the kids on all the little things that made their stay extra special. Milk & cookies at bedtime was a big hit! The lobby was so welcoming and on arrival to our interconnecting rooms we were so happy with the space we had. The rooms were beautifully decorated without being overly fussy, just right. We took in a show while in the city and also we could walk to our restaurant in Covent Garden. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel, for sure on my next trip to London I will be back. A big thumbs up from myself and the kids ",5,2018,05,14
115,Westend trip with Family,"We had an unbelievably pleasant stay at The Bloomsbury this weekend. The hotel is a little gem about 500m from Tottenham Court Rd Station. We booked two rooms with interconnecting doors. The rooms were well appointed, with nespresso machines and welcome treats for the kids. The decor is contemporary luxury with a high comfort factor. Our package included breakfast which was excellent.... But it was not the beautiful hotel surroundings that made the trip it was the staff. This is a hotel where everyone from the doormen, to reception staff, to concierge and the brilliant breakfast room staff who spoiled the kids rotten with positive attention. Big shout out to Maria and her Romanian colleague in the breakfast room who indulged my youngests desire for a feast of eggs! They ensured the mornings kicked off on the right positive note. Another big shout out to the staff who tracked down a lost sleep blanket our 10yo has had since birth... The staff at the hotel are simply awesome, they deserve credit from top to bottom. Can't wait to go back. Thank you Camille in particular for locating ""bear bear"" you made one little girl cry tears of joy! ",5,2018,05,13
115,My 2 Week Stay for Business,"I recently completed my two week stay at the Bloomsbury on business. Overall, it was fine, but I wasn’t particularly impressed with the room or service. I’ve stayed at the Radison Blu in previous years and wanted to try something different and alittle more upscale. I paid about $25 USD more per night and can’t say it’s definitely better. 

The room was a little small, but inline with other comparable rooms at this price point. I was on the sixth floor.  The room was reasonably quiet during my stay. The TV channels offered don’t offer that much variety and some of the channels don’t come in consistently - likely a satellite issue. 

Service was mixed. Check-in was relatively smooth, although there was a little mixup with my prepaid breakfast add-on that caused a double-bill the first day. I ended up cancelling the breakfast after the first day partly because of this and the fact that the breakfast wasn’t particularly anything special for the 25 USD charge. 

Servicing of my room was tidy and consistent. They offer daily turn down service which Is a nice touch. They missed one night, but no big deal. 

Front desk was ok, but not particularly friendly or especially helpful. Nothing terrible, just nothing welcoming for a new, long term guest. I had to follow up to have my invoice sent to me which should have been automatic. 

The do have a decently equipped gym, although the room is small. Fortunately, I was the only person there most of the time. 

The bar area is pretty cool, but I didn’t really take advantage of that space. 

I saw mostly tourists there during my stay. It does have a great location within walking distance to many attractions. It’s also no necessary in the heart of the action which I would consider a positive. 

The Doyle rewards program seems a little lacking so not a lot of incentive to stay with them. 

Bottom-line:  it’s Ok, but I likely won’t be staying here next year and will take my company’s business elsewhere.",3,2018,05,13
115,A real gem,This is one of the very best hotels we have stayed in as we have traveled extensively . The hotel staff is welcoming and attentive . The building and grounds are well kept and extraordinarily clean . The rooms are comfortable and well appointed . It doesn’t really get much better . It is a little more money but you get what you pay for - maybe in this case more than you pay for .,5,2018,05,13
115,Lovely hotel,"The Bloomsbury is a lovely hotel. We love relaxing in the gorgeous Coral Bar. We did wonder where the doormen were this weekend. There was always someone at the door when we stayed in January. Our room was modern and comfortable, and we loved the heated floors!",5,2018,05,13
115,The Bloomsbury Hotel,"Once again our stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel was excellent. The staff were attentive but discrete and warm without any over familiarity. The hotel was in perfect order and the special arrangements made for our stay were perfect!
Thank you all so much for making our special weekend perfect! We look forward to seeing you soon.",5,2018,05,12
115,Charming hotel,A charming hotel in a good location.  This hotel is situated in a beautiful old London building.  Lovely decor. The Bedroom was modern and clean.  Two fantastic cocktail bars which are deifintely worth a visit.  Wonderful breakfast.  Staff were very friendly and efficient.,5,2018,05,10
115,Hotel stay and drinks in the bar,"As a so traveller, I was made mist welcome at the bar by Kevin and Stefan.  They explained cocktails they were making and assisted with my choice of drink.  Both were friendly, professional and talented. ",5,2018,05,08
115,Nice Refurbishment - a few tweaks to get to WOW!,"Wonderful to return to The Bloomsbury to experience the renovation.   Allot has changed and I would say that its for the better but needs some refinement.
New reception and library are tucked away however the warm welcome continues to come through.  Rooms (mine was a corner room on level 3) have had a freshen up and feel a little more bright and warm in their decor. Wifi is fast and good supply of goodies in the mini-bar.
The Coral Room bar is busy - very busy - clearly a hit with guests and locals - can be a tad noisy but there is more than enough staff to receive good service.
Was surprised to find the old restaurant in the basement has closed to be replaced by the Dalloway Terrance - the only glitch here is that they don't hold any tables for hotel guests (so book one) and I was unable to enjoy  a meal. The staff did go out of there way to give me the snack menu in the library which was ok but not a full meal.
My biggest annoyance was the racks of laundry/linen stored in the hallways over night which in a 5 star hotel is unsightly. I'm sure with some effort they can be stored out of sight.
Yes i would return - hoping that a few tweaks had been given to really deliver on the 5 star experience it deserves.",4,2018,05,07
115,Very Special Indeed,"What a little hidden gem this place turned out to  be.
Fantastic location for the theatre we were visiting (the Dominion), very close to the tube station too.
Gorgeous hotel, friendly / helpful staff - and lots of them too.
Stunning rooms, gorgeous bedding and comfortable beds, lovely toiletries and coffee machine plus fluffy white robes.
Fabulous bar in the evening with amazing cocktails.
Breakfast outstanding with great attention to dietary needs.
Will definitely return",5,2018,05,06
115,Mediocre ,"The room we were sold was a superior double room...it was drab and stuffy with no natural light as windows faced concrete buildings. The actual lighting was so poor in the room I couldn’t apply make up, I did this in the hallway. Although the mini bar was well stocked, it wasn’t switched on and despite us asking several times for access this issues was not resolved. 

The concierge was really friendly and helpful and the bed was comfortable. However, hotel and room did not live up to expectations and certainly was not worth the price we paid. Lots of other hotels nearby nicer, cheaper with breakfast include! 

",2,2018,05,06
115,Tiny bedroom.,"Upon checking in I was told we had been upgraded...Yeah that old chestnut. The bedroom is tiny! Just enough room to get around the bed. The welcome note was addressed to someone else, so being naturally suspicious, I enquired if indeed this was our room? And if we've been upgraded, what have we been upgraded from? A portacabin in the car park?
No view from the dim window, just a service vent, no daylight.
Shower poor...low flow, low temperature. 
Overall disappointing.",1,2018,05,06
115,Staff in the club dining restaurant ❤️,"What brilliant staff, thankyou for hospitality Maria, Ionut and Peter 
I always order out of the box and Ernesto and Robert the chefs did a top job for us all 👌🏼 Beautiful food! Can’t wait to return,
Helen, Yvonne, Jordan and Steve",5,2018,05,05
115,Quaint Boutique Hotel,"We were so pleased with our choice of hotels in Bloomsbury. We were given an upgrade to the executive suite upon arrival which was nicely appointed. The hotel was very quiet at night and allowed us to sleep in both mornings. The hotel was around the corner from the British Museum which is a must see and close to a lot of good restaurants. The staff was always very nice and always greeted us with a kind word or a smile. The room was not large, but quite clean and adequate for the two of us and had everything we needed. We would definitely stay there next time we visit and are very appreciative to the staff.",5,2018,05,03
115,great interior,"we went with our granddaughter to London and needed 2 rooms with connecting door. We did book directly and when we arrived at time of check-in I asked about the possibility of larger rooms. The lady responded, you have 2 large rooms, superior and deluxe. She missed the opportunity to sell me more expansive rooms, not a good start.
Our rooms where on the 2. floor opposite the lift, unfortunately on the same floor are the meeting rooms and it got noisy when the participants arrived in the morning. Also the 2 rooms where above the entrance and terrace restaurant, if the window was closed it was fine otherwise again noisy.
Now why am I giving 4 points ? Despite those ""problems"", the Hotel has an atmosphere, extraordinary wallaper, wall painting, in general friendly and helpful staff.
Good location to get around on foot to Covent Garden, Chinatown and SOHO.
If my bedcover would have been not just a blanket but a duvet ( I understand duvets come only for kingsize beds) and the room on a higher floor, it would be great.",4,2018,05,03
115,Great hotel!,"We stayed at The Bloomsburry for 3 nights and had a wonderful time. The location is just perfect - close to the Soho area and 3 minutes walk to the underground station. The room was very spacious and comfortable and the bed was excellent. We didn't book breakfast but there are many coffee shops around. The staff was very helpful with explanations and assisted with booking dinner reservation. 
We really enjoyed during our stay and would definitely come back again.  ",5,2018,05,03
115,a fine art gallery with an excellent hotel attached,"The Bloomsbury is a Grade-II listed, Lutyens-designed building. It is a delight, standing apart from the somewhat tawdry collection of buildings close-by. It was designed and built for another time and place, as a YWCA, a safe place for women visiting from other parts of the world. I hope that it continues to be a safe place for women but, equally important, it means that The Bloomsbury contains spaces that would not feature in a modern hotel where every square metre has to be justified in terms of its cash-generating abilities. The chapel and the bar and other circulation spaces are beautifully decorated with a wealth of pictures yet not obviously revenue-generating and that must be to the despair of the accountants. We have stayed there previously, prior to the development of the Coral Room.

I believe that The Bloomsbury is, in all important matters, an excellent hotel so all that follows should be read in that light - and they did suggest that I might write a review so they must like (mild) criticism. We booked a superior room (I think that was what it was called), which turned out to be on the seventh floor, along a narrow corridor. The room was fine except for the unfortunate carpet stain near the door. It was clean, the bed comfortable, the bathroom well-equipped but lacked any real storage space. You had to navigate round the furniture. When the air-conditioning gave up, we were moved to a de-luxe room (I think that was what it was called) on the fifth floor and it was obvious how much more space you got for a modest increase in room rates.

The rate included breakfast which, over the weekend, involved large silver dishes. That is at least one Chinese import that hotels should forget. Bacon and scrambled egg were not intended for silver dishes but perhaps that was an accountant's decision. It was a much better breakfast on Monday. We had supper in the Coral Room with small plates of very good food.

The Bloomsbury has some secret about human resource management for, without exception, the staff members we met for breakfast, in the Coral Room and when the air-conditioning packed up were truly welcoming, attentive, hospitable and sorted out the problems . We were pleased to be back there again and will return, once we've saved the cash.",5,2018,04,30
115,Superb location. Good Sleep. Fabulous bar,"I recommend this hotel and plan to return.  Positives: The location is superb, a very short walk to the British Museum, Tottenham Court tube station (which serves multiple lines), Soho and West End Theatres. The room was clean, modern, and the bed was comfortable. There are reading lights over the bed, which is handy and there are socket options on the desk for whatever type of plugs you use might at home, which is a serious benefit.  I requested and got a room on the inner “courtyard' which is a large light and air shaft really, so no view but was very quiet, with no street noise which is exactly what I wanted.  Hall noise was minimal and I slept well. However, be warned that some rooms are being refurbished (April 2018), meaning that some construction noise goes on during the day.  It did not start too early, but if you were out late and wanting to sleep- in past noon, it could be a problem.  It did not bother me. I found that the service everywhere was very good. The restaurants's staff were friendly and attentive, without being intrusive and breakfast had plenty of healthy options. The Coral Room Bar is recommended, even if you don’t stay here. It has a lovely 1920s atmosphere and the bartenders are knowledgeable professionals; a bit showy but not pretentious and the cocktails were excellent. I love that the hotel as a pleasant library. I did not use it, but I am glad that it even exists.

Negatives: Like many London hotels rooms, it is quite small relative to the price, with room for maybe one garment bag’s worth of hanging items in the closet and not much room for two people. That did not bother me, as I did not spend much time in the room.(you are in London, why hang out in the room?) The rate can be high but seems a good value, comparatively. One other potential negative: the combination bath and shower is high to step into and may be difficult for those with mobility or height issues. 

The combination of location, service, quiet, a pretty terrace restaurant, and an excellent bar right in the Hotel, ensures that, If rates are good, I will be staying here again.",5,2018,04,28
115,"Slipping a bit, need to your game for a 4 star hotel","£250+for 1 night for B&B in central London. 
This is a buzzy hotel, whose bars and restaurants were busy on the Friday night we stayed.
BUT  a few minor issues that I would not expect to find in a hotel of such standard.
Check in reception has a new home off the side entrance. The space is small and cannot cope with volume. Better to move it across the corridor to a waiting area.
The bedroom was fine, reasonable size with all the facilities expected.
Breakfast, very few choices of cereals, otherwise food choice good, BUT a full English on cold plates ! WRONG get a plate warmer.
Lunch was to be a snack Superfood salad of Quinoa, Beetroot, Feta, Edamame Beans, Broccoli, Sunflower Seeds, Mint, Coriander, Pomegranate Dressing, but the kitchen had run out of the ingredients. It then took an hour for the replacement salads to arrear. 
At the end of the day it was nice to watch my cocktail being constructed at the Bloomsbury Club Bar.",4,2018,04,28
115,Exquisit stay in the great Bloomsbury hotel!,"This is a jewlery in the heart of central London. Next to Oxford Street it is perfectly placed to reach every sight and a subway in less than 5 min walking distance. I felt very welcomed at the entrance. They took my luggage and the room was ready even though I arrived early. The room itself impressed with it‘s modern retro fusion style with a fabulous all body mirror on the wall. Breakfast was served as a buffet and offered more than I expected. From cheese to ham, oats and fruits (tipp: get some orange juice). The room was cleaned twice. Once in the morning as well as around 6 pm. I can also recommend the dinnerst Bloomsbury. They have a terrace or you visit the restaurant/bar in the bottom floor!
Overall very happy with my 5 nights stay in the Bloomsbury hotel!",5,2018,04,26
115,The Bloomsbury is just Perfect!,"A celebratory occasion brought us to the Bloomsbury , for three nights. It was perfect! 
All of the staff were the friendliest and most accommodating we have ever encountered.
The location was ideal for walking to any of the historical sights , especially to the theatre district and restaurants , although, once you enter the Bloomsbury, you may never want to leave. The Coral Room is the happiest, most beautiful place you have ever seen ( if you like the color Coral) the rounded velvet settees and upholstered chairs are so inviting, and the Collection of paintings by a new young artist, Luke Edward Hall, are modern and fun. We started each day here for breakfast, returned for lunch, and once again for cocktail hour , before heading out for the evening.
I would also recommend high tea in the Mrs. Dalloway Terrace with its fantastical flowered walls complete with hand crafted bees and butterflies nestled throughout. 
The beautiful Reading Room across from the Concierge desk is another cozy, quiet place to sit before the fire and sip a glass of their English Sparkling wine curled up with one of their beautiful coffee table books. The Bloomsbury was a hard place to leave.",5,2018,04,25
115,Great location + breakfast,"Our favorite part was actually the breakfast at the hotel. They had plenty of delicious, fresh options (including vegan and gluten free foods). The serving team were the highlight. Ionut and Marina were delightful and went above and beyond our expectations. Ionut was our server twice and actually remembered all our preferences and dietary restrictions. He was very warm, funny, and helpful.

As a hotel, the Bloomsbury is the ideal location - right near the tube and within walking distance of theaters, stores, and restaurants. The room was very comfortable and clean. Only down side was the window rattled from the wind and woke us up from time to time. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,04,24
115,Such a wonderfull experience!!,"I´m constantly traveling for work around Europe. Sometimes I feel far away from home and there is just a few hotels where I can feel like home. 
I know my english isnt good so Im sorry. I just wanted to show to the hotel that I lived a lovely experience.
I work in a important enterprise in Spain and Im the first guest you should have from our company. I will say to my superiors that in our nexts trips to London must book in this hotel. 
Thank u so much for your welcoming and I will see u in June again  :)",5,2018,04,23
115,An Exceptional Memorable Experience,"Our 34th Wedding Anniversary was spent at the Bloomsbury. Not only did it exceed our high expectations, but we were greeted by polite, courteous staff who were attentive and showed a real interest in us as a couple.  The room was decorated to the highest quality and our stay was made particularly memorable by the beautiful heart shaped flower petals on our bed which welcomed us back to our room after a lovely night at the theatre.
Breakfast was a delight each morning served by welcoming staff .
The hotel is well positioned in a quiet location in the centre of London , ideally placed for all major attractions.
A big thank you to all staff who made this wedding anniversary an unforgettable experience.",5,2018,04,16
115,Great stay at the Bloomsbury!,"The location of the hotel is perfect, the staff was attentive and helpful, and the decoration of the place is lovely. The rooms are a little small, but the bed is really comfortable. My boyfriend and I also had dinner at the restaurant downstairs the hotel, Dellaway, which we really nice, despite the fact it is a little pricey.",5,2018,04,16
115,"Really nice service, great location, very well maintained","Great things:

This hotel has a boutique feel to it and is in a great spot-- both in the middle of everything, but in a very quiet and charming location. The hotel is tastefully decorated, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom is modern. The housekeeping staff is very good-- everything felt super super clean and fresh, and I notice everything. Staff was super accommodating getting me into my room early when I was right off a redeye flight.

Less great things: 
The room was small, but that's London, and I don't fault the hotel for that. It faced an interior space, which was a bit of a drag, but didn't matter that much as I was there on business and only needed the room to sleep. The worst thing for me, was that the rooms are clustered together, and I could hear everything in the hallway, and woke up anyone else came home. This made my first day a bit tough, as it was impossible to sleep during the day and early the first night. BUT I am a really really light sleeper, and even for me, it worked out okay. This might not bother other people, and other than other people entering and leaving, the hotel was quiet. I was really upset about the noise, and the staff was very nice and tried to help me-- again, I am unusual in my sensitivity to noise/vibration.

Because I think other than my sensitivity it was a really nice hotel, and because the staff really tried to make it right for me, I am giving them 5. Thanks for the friendly service.",5,2018,04,13
115,Really small but cosy Room in Downtown London!,"Stayed here for a night over the Easter Bank holiday, I must say I was surprised when we realized that the Room is really small, and made partially better only due to the fact of the coziness, location and the decor of the Room which is classy.

Will only recommend if you are staying put for a short stay of a day or two, but if anything more may wanna look elsewhere for space and comfort.",3,2018,04,12
115,Fantastic Hotel,"I stayed here for 2 nights with my partner and we absolutely loved our stay. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and our bedroom was spotless. The location is ideal for exploring the City of London, and we rarely had to use the underground due to being within walking distance of many attractions, including Oxford Street and China Town.",5,2018,04,12
115,Gorgeous stay,"Had an absolutely wonderful stay at the Bloomsbury, a couple of months ago now. The location is excellent, the hotel itself is beautiful and the staff were wonderful, especially Maria and Dimitar at breakfast, George in the Dalloway Terrace and Jane in the ground floor bar. Extremely helpful and friendly.",5,2018,04,12
115,Perfect choice,"We were so happy we stayed at The Bloomsbury.  Great location just around corner from Tottenham Court underground station.  Walking to great restaurants, The British Museum, Soho, Covent Garden, some West end theaters, Leicester square and china town.  The hotel itself is quite nice and updated.  Very comfortable beds, linens and rooms though not overly spacious.  We had a lovely configuration connecting our large bed room to a twin bed room for our children.  We did not eat at the hotel though the restaurants and bars looked really nice.  We opted out of the pricey hotel breakfast and never had trouble finding local (cheaper) breakfasts nearby.  We found the staff very nice and informative.  My only complaint was we had to correct them twice on having the wrong room rate (so keep your confirmations handy) and it held up our checking out (almost missed our train to Paris!).  We would definitely stay again as the Pros WAY outweighed the one con!!!  Luxurious.",5,2018,04,09
115,"Wonderful staff, wonderful hotel!","Have stayed twice at The Bloomsbury and it is now my hotel of choice in London. Good sized and well appointed rooms, central location down the street from the British Museum and the Tottenham Court tube station, and a fabulous choice of dining and wining spots within the hotel ( with recent additions such as the Coral Room and Mrs. Dalloway’s). The refurbished ground floor also offers cozy sitting rooms with fireplaces. Bes of all, however, is the staff. They are all incredibly helpful (especially the porters) and will go out of their way to anticipate your needs. A special shout-out to Ionut, Maria and Marina in the breakfast room who make your morning meal such a pleasure, with lots of laughs. Cannot wait for my return visit!",5,2018,04,09
115,Cosy and quiet,"Birthday treat for my wife. Best location for West End theatres. 2mins walk from all the action but the hotel is tucked away and very elegant and peaceful. Our room was small but modern and bed was perfect. One negative, the male staff in the Coral room bar were more interested in the female staff than doing their job, service was inattentive. Have attached a picture of a Long Island iced tea to show the cocktail bar staff as by the one I was served they haven’t seen one before!! Yes we would return but find another bar nearby.",3,2018,04,03
115,Outstanding service ,"Stayed for a two night break perfect location for Dominion Theatre.  The staff in all departments are wonderful breakfast service is the most professional I have seen in quite sometime. 

Highly recommended. ",5,2018,04,03
115,"Very nice stay, ideal location.","My wife booked The Bloomsbury as we were watching Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Fantastic location and within throwing distance of Tottenham Court Underground station. 

The staff were very welcoming on arrival and we were quick to check in. 

The room was as expected...clean, comfy bed, modern bathroom and plenty of options for hot drinks. 

As the room was just a place to sleep after all our tourist commitments we didn’t use the tv too much. But for those of you interested it does have sky sports. 

We had breakfast as part of our package and it was perfect every morning. Again the staff were excellent and very polite! 

The maid service were brilliant. Tea and coffee supplies topped up every time and same with the bathroom supplies. 

I would happily stay here again and would certainly recommend it.

115,Easy and elegant!,"I often go to London for performances at Covent Garden. The Bloomsbury is in a great location, easily walkable, yet far enough away to be quiet. Access to public transportation is also so easy. The lounges make meetings friends easy. The Coral Room and restaurants are also visited by locals, so it doesn't feel hotel/tourist/business only, The rooms are not grand, but comfortable and clean. The breakfast included in the room rate is taken downstairs, away from the main restaurants. The selection and quality of the food is actually quite good and the staff very professional and attentive,. I actually quickly grew quite fond of the staff (Ionut, Victor, Kal, Marina, Estelita and others); they are warm and it was nice to recognized daily when travelling and seeing a sea of strangers.",5,2018,04,02
115,Lovely stay at the Bloomsbuy,"We had a great long weekend at the Bloomsbury, and I think even better than when we last visited. Firstly, the Coral room/bar area is really great; buzzing with a good atmosphere and manages to combine style and comfort.  I felt also that the service and attention had improved, staff were more friendly and we were well looked after, overseen by Sebastian. One of the best places to stay in London and  within walking distance many attractions.",5,2018,04,02
115,Highly recommended,"The Bloomsbury Hotel's main strength is its excellent staff. During our stay they were, without exception, friendly, helpful and attentive, from front of house to the breakfast team, who were a delight to be with. Our room was spacious, well-equipped and spotlessly clean. The bed was amazingly comfortable. The Bloomsbury enjoys a superb location - close to the West End and all amenities and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Have used other hotels previously but this was by far the best. Highly recommended.",5,2018,04,02
115,Very relaxing time,"My wife and I stayed at the Bloomsbury from Thursday 15th to Tuesday 20th April. The service was excellent and the relaxed atmosphere throughout the hotel was superb. Every member of staff made you feel welcome with a “good morning”, “good afternoon” or “good evening”. We used most of the facilities during our stay. 

The rooms are a good size and fully met our requirements. The turndown service is a nice touch. 

We had tea, lunch and evening drinks in the Coral Room. The atmosphere is very relaxing during the day where you can take time to read a paper while having a good pot of tea or a light lunch. In the evening it changes into a vibrant bar. They serve large measures which is my type of bar as you can taste the gin or vodka in your drink.

Had an evening meal in the Dalloway Terrace on Sunday. The food was very good and a nice bottle of Viognier hit the spot. Service was attentive when required.

We had breakfast each day which was consistently very good. The breakfast team look after you very well. Nice to be asked how I wanted my poached eggs cooked as I like them soft.   

We will stay here when we next visit London.",5,2018,04,02
115,"Great Hotel, Great staff and a Great stay","I travel a huge amount of work and this was the first time in a long time I actually enjoyed staying in the hotel. 

I have stayed in lots of hotels in London over the years and some queen sized rooms were no larger than what I assume a prison cell would be :) The rooms are small in relative terms to hotels in the states but more than adequate. 

Genuinely was one of the most enjoyable stays I have had in London and given that I was there for over a week I actually enjoyed my stay. The room was more than adequate and the bars and shared spaces made a huge difference along with the extremely helpful staff. I think I drank around 4 pots of tea each day in the coral bar !!

My company has our UK office quite close to the hotel and 4 of us stayed there last time and everyone enjoyed their stay. 

The open spaces are great the staff and really helpful and the rooms very comfortable. 

Im staying again in 2 weeks and looking forward to it",5,2018,04,02
115,Amazing!,"Myself and my daughter spent 4 nights here - what a fabulous hotel. The service was excellent and the atmosphere throughout the hotel was fantastic. We had an evening meal and afternoon tea at Dalloway Terrace which were both lovely. We also had drinks in the Coral Bar and Bloomsbury Club bar - both had very different feels, but both equally good. We also had breakfast one morning of our stay which was good. The lounge room had a lovely open fire where coffee could be ordered, which was great as the weather was cold and wet outside, so a lovely cosy room to warm up in after a day of sightseeing. The staff were all great. Our room wasn't huge but was of a high quality and perfect for a few days in the capital. My daughter and I visit London at least once a year to go shopping and see a show, and we always choose a different hotel on each visit. However, having now stayed at The Bloomsbury, I will certainly be booking to stay at the hotel again on our next visit. What a little gem right in the centre of the city!",5,2018,04,01
115,Only place to stay in London - Perfect location!,It’s so wonderful to get good service and one feels that the staff is genuine and are always so friendly and accommodating. Special thanks to Barry and Dale from the concierge desk for extra services.,5,2018,03,31
115,Visit in London with friends,"We stayed in the Bloomsbery hotel for 4 nights in end of March. The stay was great.
The best thing about this hotel is the location : it is few minutes walk from Oxford street, Soho and Covent garden, so we were able to reach all the main attraction by walking.
The room was very comfortable and clean, but quite small.
The bar is great, beutifuly designed and serves nice cocktails.
The staff was overall friendly, but not perfect, reception people were not as polite as can be expected.
Overall it is a great hotel and I highly recommand it.",5,2018,03,29
115,Very good hotel - excellent location,"I have stayed at many hotels in the Soho/Bloombury location, and this is the best hotel I have been to. Great location, good room, excellent service and a very good breakfast. Can you ask for more?  I will be back!",5,2018,03,26
115,Quality Hotel!,"Perfect stay! Stayed on a Saturday 2 weeks ok. Great accommodation, bar areas very smart and evening food in the hotel restaurant was very good. Breakfast was great in a separate part of the hotel. All the general lounge areas were great quality. The trip was for a special birthday treat. It will be remembered for all the right reasons! Would return without hesitation!",5,2018,03,24
115,EXCELLENT HOTEL IN EVERY WAY,"Service with a smile best describes The Bloomsbury hotel we stayed at for 8 nights with our two young kids. My husband and I have traveled extensively internationally. We did a lot of research to ensure we chose the best hotel for our kids’ first experience visiting Europe. We were blown away with how amazing this hotel was. From the moment Brian Murphy (amazing concierge) greeted my kids with teddy Bears to the gifts that Marina and Ionut (Breakfast room staff) gave my kids when we left, it was a 5+star experience. Marina and Ionut helped us every day at breakfast and they were so kind and patient with my kids. I’ve never met such INCREDIBLE staff, thank you Marina and Ionut!  The rooms were extremely clean, elegant, incredible service staff and the hotel is in a great location. This made our stay perfect in every way. A special thanks AGAIN to Brian, Paolo, Marina, Ionut, Victor, Kal, and Estelita. The Bloomsbury is a true example of excellent hospitality!",5,2018,03,22
115,Mixed experience,I recently attended this location for a business meeting. The decor  around the hotel is lovely and also I think the bedrooms are well decorated and are user friendly. However beware the location of your meeting room as some have no natural daylight and worse no mobile phone signal in the room we had. The buffet lunch was full of carbs with no healthy options which was a shame. My biggest challenge was service levels for example only 1 person on reception at busy check in time but more  importantly the staff that support our event in terms of evening dinner were not that solutions oriented which was not helpful as a paying customer.,3,2018,03,21
115,"Staff excelent, food good, if a little expensive.","Room great, quiet even at front of hotel, although could hear voices in next room until the early hours.Fabulous bar in Coral Room. Very comfortable and cosy with roaring fires. Plenty of room to relax, read a book etc.",5,2018,03,20
115,Lovely hotel and staff amazing ,"I recently stayed at the Bloomsbury to go to a musical with my daughter who was celebrating her 21st birthday . From arrival to us leaving we had an amazing time . The level of service from all the staff was outstanding , nothing was too much trouble . Our room was kindly upgraded by Camille who had helped ensure our stay was perfect . We had a fabulous meal in Dalloway terrace , and cocktails in the coral room and in the Bloomsbury club after the theatre . Again staff were amazing . Thank you for your warm welcome and we look forward to staying with you again 😬",5,2018,03,20
115,Great London Hotek,"Stayed here for a birthday celebration with dinner at the Hakkasan which is 2mins walk away. Very friendly, smart hotel with great facilities and good rooms. Service was excellent and everyone in the hotel seemed to work as a team. Spent a few years working in hotels so I’m not always easy to please! Worth paying for the best room you can afford as some rooms are small (it is central London), however really comfy beds and decor not your average contract hotel, more boutique style. Doormen particularly attentive, helpful and remembered our names. Will definitely return. ",5,2018,03,18
115,Another superb stay at this fabulous  boutique hotel ,What can we say but another fantastic stay at this wonderful boutique hotel thanks to Sebastian Annandale and his fabulous staff as always was greeted with a smile when we arrived Friday 16th March and from there really enjoyed the hotel and the new choral lounge which is a must visit it really is a lovely new  cocktail bar lounge not to forget the downstairs bar which also has a great atmosphere also like to mention Sebastian the barman  in there he still rembers my cocktail I like  after all these years of visiting there with my wife  also the staff in there very friendly along with the staff who serve breakfast and not to mention the food at breakfast time very well cooked and prepared we visit here twice a year  and never disappoints a must visit  boutique hotel also the dalaway terrace is very cosy for a meal as well thanks again to Sebastian Annandale and his great staff for makeing our weekend stay more enjoyable 5 star service as always *****,5,2018,03,18
115,Beautiful Hotel,"Spent a couple of nights here with my husband and 2 teenage daughters. We had adjoining  rooms and this worked perfectly. The hotel is stunning the bars are great and breakfast was very nice.
Location was perfect.",5,2018,03,17
115,Wonderful Stay at the Bloomsbury!!,"My husband and I spent 5 nights at the Bloomsbury hotel and could not have been happier! We arrived early and not only were we able to check in to our room, but we were upgraded as well. The staff could not have been more friendly and welcoming - everything from recommendations, to directions - they truly went above and beyond. We also had daily breakfast in the Bloomsbury Club Dining room - the staff there was extremely attentive and the food was excellent!! We had drinks at the Bloomsbury Club and the Coral Room (shout out to Diego!!) - loved the variety of drinks and ambience of both. The rooms were very clean and well kept - serviced 2x a day, once being turn down service. Additionally, the hotel was walking distance to many central points of interest, and there was a tube station one block away. Would absolutely recommend The Bloomsbury and we hope to be back soon!!!",5,2018,03,16
115,Excellent Location,"Just got back from a thoroughly enjoyable 3 night stay at the Bloomsbury.  The staff could not be more helpful and attentive.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and exceptionally clean.  The location is perfect to explore Convent Garden, Oxford Street and Trafalgar Square.  Nothing is too far away and the black cabs are very reasonable if you do need to taxi anywhere.  I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone due to stay in London, we were made to feel very special whilst there.",5,2018,03,16
115,Charming,"For a special occasion with my daughter, we spent a long weekend to celebrate her 23rd birthday.
At the reception of The Coral Room, he received us with a warm smile from Gabby, who accompanied us to the main reception to check-in.
Beautiful hotel, in an excellent location. Good service. The room was a little smaller than I expected, although very comfortable. Lovely stay!",5,2018,03,12
115,Fantastic ,"Stayed at this lovely hotel with my Husband. The room was great, excellent location and amazing helpful staff.
We got a lovely surprise when we entered our room as the staff had decorated it for my Husband’s Birthday (not for another week but was an early treat)
The breakfast was lovely and top quality.
Would definitely recommend this Hotel and would stay here again on any future trips to London.",5,2018,03,12
115,Excellent hotel,"We had a great time here we loved this hotel everything about it, the décor is beautiful especially the bar and restaurant - are room was very comfortable clean and spacious we would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,03,12
115,Weekend Trip to London,"Very well located hotel in the center of London, a few walk from the tube station. Very high standard accommodations and services. Public areas of the hotel are outstanding, room (double room standard) is very nice but the decoration tends to be a little bit less spectacular than in the other parts of the hotel. 
Will definitely come back !",4,2018,03,11
115,Beautiful weekend break ,"My husband and I had a Fabulous weekend break in London at The Bloomsbury.

Stunning room, amazing service , perfect location

With so much choice in London , I would have to say value for money this is well Worth a visit 

Highly recommended ! ",5,2018,03,08
115,Great place amazing location...,"Enjoyed staying at the Bloomsbury in London, beside the hotels facilities and great location right by Tottenham court road the level of service was outstanding which helps make a business trip to a bit of a holiday.",5,2018,03,08
115,Oh dear what has happed to The Bloomsbury,"Since expanding your lounge facilities and adding the Coral Room I have to say that the quality of service and ambiance of the Coral Room and Club Bar have suffered. In the evening, the music in the Coral Room is so loud that one cannot hear one's colleagues talk. It is impossible to have a conversation without shouting. When I asked the bar staff to please turn the volume down I was told that every evening at 7PM the music was to be played at a prescribed volume.  Needless to say we left (there were 6 of us and all were guests in the Hotel). Further - twice now I have been treated with complete contempt by the staff in the Club Bar.  The Club Bar has always been a warm respite after a busy day at work. However one isn't even allowed into the bar without a reservation.  This is totally unacceptable.  Last October I was seated in the hall and promptly ignored causing us to leave after 20 minutes.  

I have been staying at the Bloomsbury for a number of years and I always bring along at least 4 of my team and stay for a week.  Now that you seem to be focusing more on attracting patrons into your bars I am seriously considering looking for alternative accommodation for our London stays.   

The Hotel continues to deliver impeccable service however service in the Club Bar and Coral Lounge have fallen below what I expect from The Bloomsbury.",3,2018,03,07
115,Amazing hotel in a great location,"The hotel is really nice and is in a great location if you want to visit central London. The nearest tube station is only a couple of minutes walk. 
The staff are really friendly, and make you feel very welcome. 
Would definitely stay there again. ",5,2018,03,07
115,Return Visit ,"Stayed four nights at The Bloomsbury Hotel on Great Russel Street 

Our room was quiet comfortable. Availed ourselves of drinks in the Coral Room and dinner at the Dalloway Terrace...both drinks and dinner were solid

The concierge was able to get us mid field tickets to see the Tottenham Hotspurs football match...what a great stay",5,2018,03,06
115,Beautiful hotel and great customer service ,"Stayed here for 1 night as we were going to the theatre. We had a complimentary upgrade which was a lovely surprise as this was actually our birthday treat (my husbands is in jan and mine is Feb) and although we didn’t mention this, it was a great treat! 
The room was lovely and big which a huge bed and neutral colours which I loved. The bathroom had a bath which isn’t too usual is many rooms in London so that was an added bonus. 
Go to the 1920’s styled bar. The cocktails are amazing and the atmosphere was perfect. It was cold out but there was outside heating and we had a blanket as well. Finished off our perfect weekend.

My only wish, that we had booked for dinner! We went elsewhere and it was awful.

Already said to my husband I would like to come back here to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary in August. ",5,2018,03,06
115,A Special Hotel for a Special Occasion ,A fabulous place to stay with attentive staff who are prepared to go the extra mile for their guests. My wife's 60th Birthday couldn't have gone better... Special cakes and a fantastic decorated room made her day. I would recommend this Hotel without hesitation to anybody who wants a touch of affordable luxury in the heart of the Capital...... Big thank you to everyone at The Bloomsbury ,5,2018,03,05
115,Stylish,"The Bar is an absolute MUST - the decor is tasteful, elegant, stylish and offers great service. A wonderful meeting place for family and friends. Loved the seating arrangements and the feeling of being pampered.",5,2018,03,04
115,Exceptional staff,"Spent one night here as going to the theatre .....beautiful building and exceptional staff.
Used the Coral bar here and found drinks were quite expensive ...and nibbles were too.
Just wish the background music was quieter ......found it irritating to have to raise our voices to conduct a conversation.The room was quite small by our standards .....and one particular gripe is that there wasn't shower mat to put inside the bath.....as I have a problem with my knees and was so frightened of slipping ...I was unable to shower with out help......very slippy!!!!!",4,2018,03,04
115,Loved it so much went back 2 days later,"I have stayed in the Doyle's other hotel in London and like them both, however this is my new favourite. I arrived when snow was falling and the doorman was straight out to collect my bag and cover me with an umbrella. Drinks in the stunning bar are a must - loved the margarita! Room service food excellent - try the harissa prawns.Re visited when weather delayed my flight and I had broken a tooth. Concierge found me a dentist on a sat! Love this place and can't wait to stay for pleasure.",5,2018,03,04
115,Best Bar in London now. Taken top spot from the Rosewood.,"Haven't stayed here yet but looks fantastic if the rooms are as good as the public areas then it'll be a treat as everything looks stunning. The bar and outside areas are wonderful. Great staff, really friendly and fantastic service and cocktails. All the smaller rooms downstairs have a great feel with great atmosphere.",5,2018,03,03
115,Lovely hotel,"I stayed in the Bloomsbury for the weekend, and it was a lovely experience. The hotel is neat, clean and the location is just perfect. However, sometimes it is a bit hard to navigate in the hotel itself, but this can easily be solved by putting up some signs. The restaurant is decorated really nicely, and the food was delicious. However, there was only one vegetarian option (apart from salads). Overall a really nice place to stay, and a special thanks to the lovely staff (George from the restaurant, Jane from the bar, Dimitar and Maria from breakfast and Tringa from reception) who were extremely hospitable and made the experience really unforgettable!",4,2018,02,28
115,"Well located, modern and elegant hotel",We stayed there with my husband for a day while we did our Christmas shopping and we had a great time. The hotel stuff are very kind. We had a beautiful room which was very quite. I loved the modern bathroom. Was watching tv from the bathroom! The restaurant is fantastic. Great seafood and a great variety of all other options!,5,2018,02,28
115,The Bloomsbury ,"Fantastic hotel, lots of friendly, attentive staff, amazing Coral bar with a great choice of different cocktails, great decor, beautiful cosy bedroom, great shower and toiletries  and delicious bar snacks and breakfast. Thank you. Such a treat. ",5,2018,02,27
115,Hiccups,"Stayed for two nights for business. Hotel is nicely decorated and in a good location with the closest metro station less than 5 min walk and major shopping districts within walking distance. However there were some things that I thought could be improved.

Check-in: I had requested an early check-in but, of course, was told that this cannot be guaranteed, which is perfectly okay as this is not completely at the disposal & situation of the hotel. So I went to the hotel a bit past 4pm expecting to be checked in right away. There was only one person at the reception  and after some wait, she told me that my room wasn't ready and that it might need another 10 minutes to finish the inspection. I wasn't expecting an early check-in but a late check-in? This has never happened to me before.

Bill: The bill was under the door in the morning of the check-out and it had breakfast charge listed. I didn't have it and expllocitly declined when I was asked at the time of check in. The hotel has an option for express check-out but it wasn't for me as I needed to sort this out.

Check-out: Wasn't asked a second question when I pointed out the issue, which I appreciate. However, I was told that the updated invoice will be sent to my email address right away and I even confirmed my email address is correct. However, I never received the invoice even after two days and I had to send a request via email to finally receive it after a day. Also even though I changed my credit card at time of check-in, it wasn't registered in the system.

Hotel itself isn't bad, but given this experience, I wouldn't want to stay here when I am on a tight schedule / in a business trip.",3,2018,02,27
115,Fantastic Bloomsbury ,"Recently returned from an overnight stay at the Bloomsbury for our anniversary in London and we had a wonderful time, from the moment we arrived at the hotel the staff were there to make sure everything ran smoothly and we felt very well looked after, the staff ranging from door staff, restaurant, room, front desk, bar areas anywhere were exceptional in being polite, friendly and professional, making you actually felt like they cared, something not all hotels offer.
The hotel itself is spotless clean, very well decorated and good size room with very comfortable bed and pillows, I actually slept better than I do in my own bed, our room 508 was also quiet.
Location of the hotel is perfect for walking into theatre land, Covent Garden, Leicester Square, Soho, Piccadilly Circus, regents street etc.
We would definitely return and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend to anyone.",5,2018,02,26
115,Lovely weekend stay,"This Hotel is a fabulous base for theatres.  We chose a queen room (711) which was lovely and clean with robes and slippers tea and Nespresso machine.  Very comfortable bed and bathroom with all amenities and nice products.  The staff were all very helpful and courteous,opening doors and checking we were happy. Only gripe was that cooked breakfast was tepid and had to ask for a coffee 3 times before it was forthcoming.  Maybe I would suggest doing room only and going out for breakfast.",5,2018,02,23
115,Fabulous Hotel!,"Have stayed at this hotel many times & it never disappoints! Perfect location, spotless, great staff & The Coral Room a wonderful addition to an already fabulous hotel. Would highly recommend. Just wished we had stayed longer!",5,2018,02,22
115,"It was nice, but didn't quite hit the mark all round.","So we stayed at The Bloomsbury last week for my partner’s birthday. I booked this in advance and had left a couple of comments about our stay prior. Being my partner’s birthday in our room they had placed a birthday plate, on the dresser, which my partner really appreciated, Thank You!

So as time past we thought to go have a cocktail in the bar prior to going out for dinner and then a show that we were going to see. So we went on down to the Coral Room, now the decoration and ambience really is impressive. We seated ourselves in the lounge area. But having worked in hospitality I know the service did not meet the hotel in how it presents itself. We sat for around 10-15 minutes, having multiple members of staff rushing past and not even acknowledging us. It wasn't as if it was extremely busy in there.  

I did get fairly frustrated, there wasn’t a menu to read, which I would presume would be given to you by a member of staff. Which is fine, when this is the service you would expect to be paying for. But nothing. One thing I did witness was staff chatting about and one had even hung off the end of the bar preoccupied, checking her payslip. So we thought to go see in the other bar downstairs, and whether it would be better. This bar was shut, curtain pulled, which I found quite odd, as it seemed to be the hotels actual original bar.

So we went back up to the Coral Room, though I didn’t particularly want to at this point. We sat down in same table as before and a girl finally came to serve us. She was okay, but not particularly charismatic and the service was slow. I had to ask for water more than once. The cocktails were okay but expensive for what they were and not majorly exciting. And then service included… Questionable. 

Another thing that I was quite unimpressed by was the how our shower unit hose wasn’t attached to the wall properly. Outside our room door directly upon the carpet I noticed it almost seem to disintegrating, fluffy bits around a large patch that went right through to the weave below. And upon closer inspection you could clearly see moths crawling across it. Gross. 

I have pondered whether to write something but for me this experience really tainted my stay and it brings me great regret to say that. But I honestly feel you should address the service in the Coral Room, as it doesn’t meet what you would expect. 

However, The breakfast on the other hand was tremendous. The food was really great! A nice variety on offer. Our cooked English breakfast was perfect. The members of staff who work in there are really good. The supervisor was very polite, very attentive and a real asset, in fact if you were to way up the staff who work in their than in comparison to your Coral Lounge they would run rings around them it seems. The receptionist was also very nice I might just add.

Don’t get me wrong the stay on the whole was nice, amazing location, but not quite what I was hoping, I’m sorry to say.

Thanks Jack",3,2018,02,21
115,A calm delight,"This is my second stay at The Bloomsbury and it just gets better!  The hotel is simply divine.  The staff are its greatest assets, they are all exceptional at their jobs.  Nothing is too much trouble.  On each visit we have received top notch service way and beyond.  Thank you.  ",5,2018,02,19
115,The most beautiful hotel !,"We had a wonderful weekend break away . Upon arrival we were treated like royalty. The staff at the reception upgraded our hotel room  and they couldn't have been any friendlier if they tried . The rooms were impeccable and every amenity was catered for inside.(The mattresses are heavenly to sleep on )The decor throughout the hotel is truly beautiful . A mix of Arts and crafts interior design and Deco within The coral room .The staff made our trip even more special  and we were so appreciative of how attentive every service was.

The Sunday breakfast was varied between continental and English  . I have truly never eaten scrambled eggs that taste so delicious. ( please give me your recipe)The whole cooked breakfast  was also on a par with especially brilliant sausages. I just wish I had , had enough room to try more of the continental offerings as they looked equally scrumptious. 

I would like to give a particular mention to Iohut . As a surprise he brought me out some fresh berries .He was positively lovely throughout our breakfast sitting .He truly made me feel very special.

Next time we stay in London we would love to stay again . 

",5,2018,02,18
115,Just the place to stay,"The room was v comfortable, the staff extremely helpful and friendly - the concierge, at the desk, in the restaurants
Breakfast is excellent and the staff (Kal, Maria, Ionut and Estelita) very attentive
I like the bars (decor outstanding) and the food in the Terrace was great",5,2018,02,18
115,The best,"This hotel is fantastic. Is it the food? Well the foods brilliant. Is it the bedrooms? Well they’re great too. The best thing about this hotel is the staff. I have stayed there on a couple of occasions now and the staff are second to none. See you soon, once again! ",5,2018,02,17
115,A haven of comfort,"A beautifully  and well appointed hotel. Good jazz in the bar, light and comfort in the Coral Room, and we appreciate the Dalloway terrace for its coziness, its meals and of course its people. Its location is perfect : British Museum, Soho, Chinatown, all very close.",5,2018,02,14
115,A nice surprise!,"I have passed this hotel many times, because it seemed most expensive in the neighborhood. Actually, it's likely the greatest deal there: nearly five-star service  like twice a day housekeeping, chic decor and attentive, kind staff etc. for this price in central London. And the restaurant crowded with local people is sign of a good hotel, though I unfortunately couldn't visit it. I love to try it next time.",5,2018,02,14
115,Lovely hotel but service needs to be improved,"The property is beautiful but I think the staff need to be invested in a little more. 

Staff in The Coral Room made little attempt to keep an eye out for customers and to offer them service. It was literally like they were trying to avoid eye contact with guests. The 12.5% service charge (discretionary of course) felt like a bit of a slap in the face when we had to approach them for service on a number of occasions.

Breakfast on Saturday, albeit a buffet not the advertised a la carte, was good. Sunday however was an absolute shambles with the hot buffet being totally empty with no staff apparently responsible for making sure it was stocked. It was a good 15 minutes before it was fully restocked. We had to ask for every cup of coffee, not a single one was proactively offered. The reason I was given for the poor service was because they were busy. But as the hotel knows the occupancy level, and the fact it has switched from a la carte to buffet breakfast suggests they already knew they were going to be busy. 

The room (a deluxe) was a good size, reasonably well maintained with effective air conditioning. We had two issues in the room, both of which were promptly fixed by cheerful maintenance staff. 

Apologies for the shortcomings and a discount at check out were welcome, but I would rather our stay had fewer disappointing moments, all of which were entirely avoidable.",4,2018,02,12
115,Superb hotel,The hotel is well situated for visiting theatres and for shopping. It is located in a quiet street close to Tottenham Court tube station.  The staff are delightful and keen to help.  Service is friendly and efficient.  We received a great welcome on arrival for breakfast from Maria who was extremely helpful.  It was good to have quality pillows (not foam rubber!) and the bed was extremely comfortable.  I would definitely return.,5,2018,02,12
115,A great place in London,"I must apologize if I only write my review now. I was three time in this hotel and I will tell you about my last experience, which confirmed the previous two. The hotel is strategically located between Tottenham Court Road tube station and the British Museum. All the staff members are extremely kind and professional. I want to mention Maria in the breakfast restaurant.
I am Italian and each time I was there I did not have problems to find an Italian staff member at the reception desk. The rooms are clean and quite (noisy people exist everywhere and there is no wall able to stop them). The restaurant, called Dalloway Terrace from Virginia Woolf's Mrs.Dalloway, serves excellent food. Breakfast is very good too.",5,2018,02,11
115,Keeps getting better and better,"I have been coming for over twenty Years and the hotel gets better and better. The most recent changes are tremendous but I am pleased that they have retained the bar in the lower ground floor to compliment the spectacular Coral Room. 

The Dalloway Terrace is, IMHO, a go-to bistro in London regardless if you are a hotel resident. The staff there on Wednesday night went out of their way to accommodate my party of 5 ; after initially having to reluctantly turn us away (no reservation and were full), they managed to do some jiggery pokery, and came looking for me in the hotel bar to say they could sit us after all. Terrific service and food. 

I also would point out that every single member of staff I encountered walking around the hotel made a point of smiling and saying hello. Every single one. Well done. 

Looking forward to next year.",5,2018,02,11
115,A Wonderful Break,"The hotel is in a wonderful location for shopping, theatre land and public transport links for places further away, but is quiet and peaceful. The staff are polite, friendly and helpful, remarkably so compared to a lot of the staff in other London establishments. We paid for a suite as this was a special occasion so I cannot comment on the standard rooms, but we were very pleased with the size, layout and facilities of our room. Overall cleanliness was excellent. One day when we returned to our room at 3pm they had forgotten to service it, but when I phoned housekeeping someone came very quickly and I have never seen a hotel room cleaned so thoroughly. We will certainly use the hotel again.",5,2018,02,11
115,"Brilliant, Loved it.","We stayed in the hotel last night. Loved it slept really well, even though the champagne might do had something to do with that, and reading the bar bill at 7.00am this morning was a shock to the system.

The curtains block out all the light, beds were really comfortable.

Staff were very happy and friendly, even when I disputed the bill, they changed it to what I had pointed out without questioning.

Lovely looking place, all staff from reception to the bar staff and on the doors of the hotel were very good.

Highly recommended and I think we will be back maybe as soon as 3 weeks time.

Don't get to carried away at the bar like we did, loved it.",5,2018,02,10
115,The most bizarre experience ,"I booked two rooms through Booking.com a month before the trip. Our friends arrived first and checked into their room (receptionist Alma). They were told they have been upgraded to a superior room. We’ve we arrived they had no record of my reservation (Suzanna) and it took 30 mins to check in even though I gave them the reservation number. Turned out that they had booked our friends into our room and had their room for us. No problem just change the names. Our friend mentioned they had a bit of confusion but checked in under their name. We were also told we had been upgraded to a superior room which was like a cupboard! 
The bar and breakfast eggs Benedict was exceptional but £18.50 is a joke.
When we checked out they called me by my fiends name and said you’ll find us in their room and there was laundry on the bill! We checked out and asked if the room was a superior and was told but the receptionist who told our friends they were upgraded that no they are both standard rooms?? 
Our friends checked out and someone else’s laundry had been put on their room! What a farce!! I stayed at the Conrad St James last week in Westminster which is 10 times better and much bigger rooms . The shower was a terrible dribble too.
Avoid is my recommendation ",2,2018,02,10
115,Good location and great price for the room,The bar was very cool as the décor made it look like an old pub. Very close to Tottenham Tube station which is very convenient. The outdoor patio seating look great and looking forward to staying there in the warmer months where I can enjoy a meal outside.,4,2018,02,07
115,Perfect for a weekend away,"Nice hotel for a weekend away, good location and not as expensive in comparison to other hotels. Staff were very friendly!! Very cool bar and a very good breakfast. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,02,07
115,An exceptionally good West End hotel,"The Bloomsbury is by any standards a fine hotel. It is exceptionally comfortable. It is notably well-located being just a few moments walk from the British Museum and an even shorter walk from Tottenham Court Road tube station and from the many bus routes that pass by it;and it is handy for theatreland and for the legion of restaurants to be found in Covent Garden, Soho, and Fitzrovia. The hotel's staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful (Ionut, Marina, Kal, and Kihga at breakfast deserve a special mention). Considering all this it's also good value.",5,2018,02,05
115,Private Dinner venue,"We held a private dinner in the Seamus Heaney Library, at The Bloomsbury Hotel, for 16 people last week,  which was a huge success.  The setting is a little different to a normal private room in a restaurant (you could be forgiven for believing you are dining in the library of a stately home) and was very well-received for it's authenticity and atmosphere.  The food was wonderful and service second-to-none - Silvio and his team were superb.  Highly recommended!",5,2018,02,05
115,Great experience,"We stayed here for two days and were really surprised at the high level of standards here in the hotel - plus the various bars and restaurants on site are really stylish and have a great atmosphere. We were given a lovely room which was very comfortable and quiet but yet still you have a great central location, very easy to walk to covent garden, soho etc. We had drinks in the Coral Room which is a stunning art deco style bar and lounge and would highly recommend it just for drinks with friends if you are not staying in the hotel. The breakfast was very good and the staff are all very professional and friendly. ",5,2018,02,05
115,A birthday treat,"My husband and I live in London but decided to book a night here as a birthday treat. I found the hotel via googling and thought it was a reasonable price and well reviewed. We stayed in a Superior room which was a good size and the bathroom was lovely. We slept very well. I had requested a quiet room not overlooking a road so our view was of an inner courtyard - not overly aesthetically pleasing but very quiet so it was perfect for us for a one-night stay. We had drinks with friends in the newly refurbished Coral Room - cocktails were rather expensive as you'd expect from a London hotel bar but the wine was more moderately priced. The atmosphere and service was great and we were lucky enough to be seated next to the fireplace which was very cosy. Breakfast was on the lower ground floor and consisted of both a buffet and also an a la carte option. The buffet spread was extensive and so we opted for this - plenty of pastries, hams, cheese, baguette, yogurts etc and also a selection of hot food (scrambled egg, bacon, amazing hash browns and sausages) all very nice. Would certainly recommend this hotel to friends and family and should we decide to treat ourselves to a hotel stay in our home city again in the future then we would certainly return. ",5,2018,02,05
115,A new  London Bolt hole,"This was my first time at The Bloomsbury- and it was fantastic. It was the perfect location to meet collegues, and have some serious grown up meetings, while being a few steps away from all distractions of Soho and the west end. The rooms are a reasonable size (for a London Hotel) and beds are comfortable with quality linnen. A generous warm marble bathrooms and great plumbing are very welcome. The rest of the hotel has been finished with an attention to detail, excellent staff, well designed spaces (the Coral Room was a particular favourite) great lighting full of fresh flowers and was very clean.  As a regular London visitor, i think i may have found my new London home.",5,2018,02,04
115,Great hidden gem for a London mini break,"We stayed at The Bloomsbury for a couple of nights for a short break to London, taking advantage of their weekend B&B offer.  It was a lovely hotel and (for Central London) we had a decent sized room.  A particular highlight were the delicious cocktails in the recently refurbished Coral Room bar which we took advantage of on both nights.  The hotel really is a hidden gem in a great location - we were within easy walking distance of a number of sights including Trafalgar Square, Oxford Street, Covent Garden and Leicester Square.",5,2018,02,04
115,Week end trip,"Charming Art Deco style hotel, nice greeting at the entrance with somebody taking are bags into reception. Got checked in early so good start. Came back to the hotel about 8.30 expecting to get a drink at the lovely bar you see on the web site. Met a chap at the entrance who told us we needed to book to go in??? I mentioned the other bar upstairs thinking we could just go in and we were escorted very formally to the other bar and sat down feeling very awkward. We then had a look at drinks menu saw the prices and decided to give it a miss £12 for a shot of gin is a bit excessive, with me having a double and my wife a single would have come to around the £40 mark with tonics. A nice place but certainly not the ritz. Another awkward situation was the night porter knocking on the door around 10.30 asking if we wanted are bed covers turning back, we were already settled in for the night she could see we were. 10 minutes later knocked again explaining she had forgotten that she had already called. Ritz style without the finesse.  However rooms were very nice and decorated to a high standard with nice fixtures and fittings. Just almost seems like they punching out of their weight here.",4,2018,02,04
115,Great hotel in a very good location,"A good sized hotel conveniently situated just a couple of minutes stroll from Tottenham Court Road tube station as well as Oxford Street, the British Museum and many other nearby attractions. We had a good sized room on the top floor which was very quiet with no noise either from other residents or traffic, although the downside of that was that the only widows were skylights, so there was no view. As often seems to be the case with hotel rooms, it was really far too hot without having the air conditioning running, which is both noisy and wasteful. The bed was very big and very comfy, and the bathroom too was a decent enough size although personally I’d prefer a separate shower cubicle to an over bath one, especially when there is a large gap at the bottom of the shower screen meaning as much water ended up on the floor as anywhere else. The bathroom floor was also heated which was a nice touch, especially when walking in there barefoot.

There was a safe provided in the room as well as tea/coffee making facilities and complimentary biscuits. The room was all clean and tidy, but housekeeping was perhaps a bit hit and miss in some ways – the first day we had a facecloth supplied, but that mysteriously disappeared on the second day; the turn down service on the first night left a robe on the bed and complimentary chocolates – on the second night we had neither; our friends only had one set of Nespresso capsules rather than two, and so on. We didn’t eat breakfast here as it seemed rather expensive and there are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby. We did try the cocktail bar though, and this was a pleasant and relaxed spot with a good range of drinks. Although we only really spoke to the staff at check-in and check-out, they all seemed pleasant and friendly, and we were given a complimentary bottle of water on leaving which was a nice touch. Overall I thought this was a very nice hotel in a good location, and quite reasonably priced for central London. I would happily return.",4,2018,02,02
115,Lovely Terrace - A few Service Suggestions,"This is my fourth stay at Bloomsbury - employer has a corporate discount. Stayed a full week. Front Desk service is always phenomenal and the new renovation is stunning, including a gorgeous new terrace. 

Suggestions to management: upon check-in, would be helpful to be advised that the new restaurants now fill quickly and are nearly impossible to dine without a reservation on the weekend and some week nights. 

Unfortunately a few negatives worth mentioning, the fire alarm went off 3 times between 10pm and 8am during our week stay. Strange. We ordered a juice from the menu at breakfast for take-away and it took nearly 25 minutes then the credit card machine wasn't working and we were late for work. Tried to get a drink at the lounge downstairs which used to be an open bar but it now a reservation only space and were asked to leave. 

Best part of the stay - the concierge on Friday and Saturday made some really nice reservations for dinner and drinks. One of the restaurants gave us free cava for our booking!

I will stay again but request a quiet room and make a reservation for the terrace in advance",3,2018,01,29
115,Hidden gem in perfect location,"Just had a lovely 2 night break at the Bloomsbury which was a surprise from our daughter and son in law for our Anniversary.Our daughter and famiy are regular visitors to the hotel and can see why - it is in a perfect location,very classy and comfortable where the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Great choice at breakfast and a lovely touch to receive choc strawberries in room and scattered rose petals when we arrived back in the evening.Must mention a special thanks to Sebastian and Brian for making our stay so memorable.Would highly recommend and hope to visit again in the future.",5,2018,01,28
115,A very good hotel.Near Oxford street and the British Museum.,"We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights just before Christmas with my granddaughter.
We got a big enough room for three.
The breakfast was very good.The hotel staff was very polite and helpful.
I want to particularly note: Marina Estlita and Dount Maria for their courtesy.",4,2018,01,28
115,Great hotel in the heart of SOHO,"This hotel is worth it's nightly price. SoHo is super central and easy to get most tourist areas of downtown by walking, and anywhere in London via underground from Totem Court station. 

The hotel staff were the nicest I have ever encountered anywhere. Seriously helpful. They seemed like the really cared!!

The room was a very nice size (hard to find in European cities), modernly decorated and immaculate. 

The hotel bar was pretty cool. It had that classic but modern vibe and at night reminded me of the bar from the Shining, but in a cool way. Drinks were pricey (to be expected) but not insane. Bar staff was absolutely lovely. Very attentive and funny.

They have a beautiful outdoor cafe area with heaters where you can sit surrounded by greenery. 

Definitely will make this our go-to hotel for London.",5,2018,01,27
115,Fabulous hotel,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury for three nights. The only way to describe our stay, in a word: amazing!
Our room had everything we needed. The place was immaculate and very attractive. 

Turn down service with chocolates✔️
Great shower with excellent toiletries ✔️
Nespresso machine✔️
Pillow selection✔️
Extremely friendly, helpful staff ✔️
Wonderful breakfast included✔️
Great location ✔️

In short: very highly recommended. ",5,2018,01,26
115,Impeccable,"Our stay at the Bloomsbury hotel was impeccable! We were greeted with a warm welcome as soon as we arrived and the attentiveness of the staff was consistent throughout the duration of our trip. The interiors are stunning, especially the wonderfully decorated sitting room with an open fire. We loved the Coral Bar and Dalloway Terrace just outside.  The rooms were very modern and clean and the hotel is in a fantastic location. Perfect for a special occasion! 5*",5,2018,01,25
115,Perfect location for a theatre trip,"We selected this hotel due to its location for a recent theatre trip.  It was perfect in so much as it was just a twenty minute walk from Euston Station, Covent Garden and very close to theatres.  Hotel was lovely, very clean and modern, room was quiet.  Breakfast was very nice, good selection of everything.  Staff very quick, well mannered and helpful, would definitely return.",5,2018,01,23
115,Work trip accommodation,"Another amazing stay at The Bloomsbury and I LOVED the recent addition of The Coral Bar! Great new layout and the lunch we had in the bar was delicious! Breakfast was also great - such a selection and brilliant service! 
Will be back AGAIN, I'm sure!",5,2018,01,23
115,"Great stay, easy place, strong standards","I chose the hotel for the convenience of the location and was very happy with my stay. It is a small Irish-owned chain with a visible strong emphasis on standards. It's one of those fantastic hotels that are efficient yet effortless. The breakfast is great and the supervisor of the breakfast room (Kinga) deserves a special mention for her outstanding hospitality professionalism. Coral Room's and Dollaway Terrace's staff are also exemplary. The weakest point of the hotel is a somewhat unwelcoming reception welcome, so to speak, whose clean-cut efficiency stands in contrast with the warmth of other offering by the hotel, but overall it is a great place to stay. ",5,2018,01,23
115,Beautiful hotel,"I stopped here for just one night and it was a lovely experience, hotel is very nice and clean, all the staff we had contact with where very polite and friendly. The coral room is great for drinks and sitting at the bar gives you a great view of the master cocktail makers doing there thing! ",5,2018,01,23
115,"Beautiful, classy hotel","We just returned from a stay for four nights at the Bloomsbury and loved it. The room was spacious by London standards and has nice touches like robes, great shower amenities, etc. Location is quiet but walkable easily to major bar and restaurant areas. Recommend cocktails elsewhere than the lobby bar, it’s beautiful for one but lots of other options a few blocks south near Seven Dials. ",5,2018,01,21
115,Pure Class,"A wonderful place to stay in the West End if you're seeking quality!
Food, drinks, accommodation and stunning bars. Whether you wish to sit back and enjoy a quiet relaxing drink or enjoy sumptuous food and drink with first class service the Bloomsbury Hotel has it all!!
Thank you to all the staff who provide first class service in this classy hotel.",5,2018,01,21
115,Perfect Weekend Getaway!,"My husband and I stayed here last weekend and were blown away... by everything! The hotel itself is gorgeous, the staff was amazing, and the location can’t be beat!

Although we only stayed for 3 nights, we are making it a point to come back for our next London visit. 

Our favorite part of the stay was the downstairs bar. The bartenders were A+! We asked them to make us drinks with certain things and they creativity came up with amazing concoctions! 

Thank you for an amazing visit! We can’t wait to come back!💕",5,2018,01,20
115,Not a great price/value ratio,"I felt the hotel was expensive for what it provided. Despite 300 pound room with included breakfast, one is told that scrambled eggs will be charged extra. The waiters at breakfast seemed rather confused, bringing orders to wrong tables. Location is great, rooms are fine, but I don't think I'll be staying again, certainly not at this price.",3,2018,01,20
115,"Great stay, excellent staff and trendy bars/resturants","Me and my partner had a great stay at the Bloomsbury just before Christmas. The hotel was beautiful and had very trendy bars / restaurants. Added extra was seeing some of the Hollyoaks cast around the hotel. 

The staff were great, very friendly and happy to have a chat, letting us know where to head the next day for some shopping and how to get around town. 

Location of the hotel is perfect. Just a short walk to Oxford street and many great restaurants a stones throw away. 

We addded breakfast on arrival and did not regret this! Choice of continental or cooked, with fresh smoothies and juices as an added extra.",5,2018,01,17
115,"Shsssshh, don’t tell anyone","Right, I’m going to let you into a little secret. 

In about six months you won’t be able to get a room in this place! It, along with the rest of the bars in this hotel and the rest of this hotel rest of this hotel for that matter are going to be the hottest places to be in London. 

Mark my words!

At the moment you can use one of their sumptuous, eclectic, fun rooms for a price that is half of what it should be. The service is ridiculously good as is the food wine and atmosphere.

So in short, please don’t go, I don’t want anyone else to discover this amazing oasis in the heart of the mad place that London is!

I’m now Instagramming the places I review, so if you want to follow, I’m at MelM01.  

Shout if you have any questions.    

Cheers   

Mel ",4,2018,01,16
115,Excellent hotel,"Stayed for business meeting. The room was very good and had all the facilities you'd expect in a hotel of this standard.
The lack of space in the two lifts was a little surprising and meant there was a wait at times to find one with some space.
However, the thing which I'll take from this stay was the experience and service. The bar was stunning and the staff could not have done more to be of assistance.",5,2018,01,15
115,Surprise Christmas at The Bloomsbury!,"Arriving at Heathrow on December 24 my husband learned that his passport wasn't good to continue our onward travel to the Alps and we were stranded in London until the Embassy opened three days later.  No knowing what to do I called The Bloomsbury where we were scheduled to stay on our return a week later. On hearing of our plight the manager Sebastian told us to come right over and he would settle us into a room.  Not only did he honor the special rate for our future reservation (much lower than what the rooms were selling for that night) he added Christmas Breakfast  then followed up with an upgrade to a larger room.  As we unpacked on Christmas Eve there was a knock at our door and we opened it to Sebastian who was holding two glasses of champagne and a sincere offer to help us out in any way during our stay.  He is a truly a marvelous and caring person.

A few days later we finally made it to the Alps but not before our surprise trip to London ended with a Christmas Miracle. Same Day tickets to HAMILTON for e100!!

The Bloomsbury is a gracious and comfortable hotel nestled in the theatre district. It's the quietest hotel I've ever stayed at in London. The rooms are newly renovated and sparkling clean, the bed was perfect. Lunch or Dinner at Dalloway Terrace is delicious and the setting is so romantic! The Coral Room is great for a drink or light bite. The entire staff is as warm and wonderful as Sebastian.  The building has an interesting history and the ballroom is magnificent. There is a cozy library to read in or chat with other guests.  Needless to say The Bloomsbury is now our London go-to hotel.  Thank you again to Sebastian and the Bloomsbury for saving Christmas!!",5,2018,01,14
115,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel, great location, very charming and clean. The one con is that rooms aren’t well-soundproofed (I am a light sleeper) and it’s certainly not cheap, but you pay for the excellent location and finishes and great service ",5,2018,01,14
115,£45 for a cognac,"Very expensive. Room small but bed very comfy. Well stocked mini bar. Bar was beautiful and staff very attentive. Cocktails were superb. Breakfast was absolute rubbish. Watery eggs, flaccid bacon and the sausages looked raw!! Great shame.",3,2018,01,14
115,"Very good location, service and room","Very like to stay in this hotel. 
very polite staff, always ready to help.
Clean and comfortable rooms with all amenities. In the room there are also an iron, an umbrella, a coffee machine nespresso. Very Reccomend.",5,2018,01,13
115,Lock up your valuables!!!,"I loved everything about this hotel, EXCEPT.  One evening I got back to my room and noticed my shoes were in a different place and someone had gone through my backpack.  Sure enough, after I checked by belongings, someone stole a very sentimental ring that my mother gave me (it was not valuable hence why it was not in the safe).  I immediately notified the guest relations manager.  She was very attentive and said she would interview everyone who entered my rooms that day.  It just happened that I was checking out the next day.  I checked out and the manager said she would let me know once the room was examined if the ring was found in the room.  It wasn't until I got back in the states (1 week later) that she told me the ring was not found in the room and she suggested I file police report.  It would have been nice if she had told me that while I was still in the UK.  The way in which this was handled was not what I expected.  There are a million hotels in London and someone else will get my business.  I caution anyone staying at the Bloomsbury,  LOCK UP YOUR BELONGS, or better yet stay somewhere else.",1,2018,01,11
115,Beautiful hotel in good location,"Overall we had a great two night stay at the Bloomsbury. The hotel and rooms are beautifully decorated and appointed. We were with our young son and loved that there were milk and cookies at turndown service. The location is great for walking around Mayfair, Covent Garden, visiting the museums, shopping on Oxford street and near lots of food and drink options. Of course the buses and trains are also nearby. If you do arrive by car/taxi it can be quite difficult - there isn't really anywhere to park and unload your luggage, and luggage has to be taken up a flight of stairs to get to reception. They do have a button at the bottom of the stairs to request assistance. We had a small issue with our booking - I had clicked on a 'breakfast included' deal and booked, but somehow my booking finalized without the breakfast (I must have navigated out of it.) I immediately contacted the hotel via email with my booking to try to fix this, and included the details - however I received a reply by someone who must have had english as a second language as the issue didn't get resolved, and the reply was quite confusing. After another email and then once we got to the hotel a discussion with staff it still wasn't entirely resolved but they did comp me a free breakfast. It was a little frustrating though - it would have been nice to have the issue resolved straight away without me having to spend time during my holiday following up.",4,2018,01,11
115,The best breakfest ever! ,"I stayed for just one day, but it was  perfect because everything I need to do was in a walking distance.. Jero and Sebastian assisted me with my check in, and throughout my stay, by showing me around, explained me how to use the 24hs gym, helped me with my wake up call and breakfast arrangements. There was cold water in The gym and I liked that!! 
At breakfest I ate The best Benedict egg I have ever eaten!! It was REALLY GOOD! 
 Maria and Kinga were very welcoming and friendly, looked after me really well, always asking if I wanted something else.. The cappuccino was also Good! Ah.. And there was expresso in The room!! I surely recommend it!! ",5,2018,01,11
115,Best hotel i have ever stayed in!,"This is a must for all visiting London. We can't get over how lovely all the staff were and special word of thanks to Sebastian who not only helped with our accommodation but also arranged a Birthday treat very sweet and kind. The breakfast crew were amazing and interacted with all their guests in a very approachable and professional way an extra special thanks to Esta, Maria and Ivonat (male)  (sorry mispell) absolutely out of this world couldn't have asked for more from you all just simply incredible top notch service and beautifully presented meals.
You made my Birthday treat a real pleasure and beautiful rooms with ambiance and everything in its place. 
Many Thanks and best of wishes for 2018 Lauretta and Alex Jones",5,2018,01,10
115,Cramped room good location hotel,"The Bloomsbury has a chapel meeting room that has the distinction of the first YWCA. Also a a renovated entry area which looks very nice and quaint. The adjoining dining and bar (coral bar) are also very nice. So that's it for outside of your room. My room (7th floor of 8) had a very small window overlooking a gravel stretch and walls at window level. The bathroom had a shower only (Shower-head only adjustable for tall people), with absolutely no way to turn around with a towel in hand  or surface areas to store anything but a toothbrush. Luckily, I only had one luggage bag along, because I would not know where to put an additional bag anywhere but to squeeze it on the one side of the bed along with my first bag on top of all the decorative bedding. There is a table/desk, but it is occupied by a small TV, a coffee maker, $4 water bottles and a big box which has nothing in it but an outdated guide to the hotel. So, put it in the closet, right? Well, there are 2 bathrobes, an ironing board, a safe and a full set of wine glasses, teacups etc. So If I want my stuff somewhat out of sight, or hang it, I would have to get rid of all that. But where? There is a minibar, but it is very stocked with pricey usual stuff, so you cannot store anything of yours in there. Literally all  surfaces (of which there are little) are occupied by some useless thing or another. Or no surfaces at all.
Location, lobby, bar is almost exceptional, but when you are in your room, you will feel disappointed.
I know it's London and I am used to small rooms, but this has been one of the worst uses of space that I have seen here. Colleagues that were here at the same time confirm the same misgivings and plusses.",3,2018,01,08
115,Our favourite place to stay in London,Yet again another stay at the Bloomsbury with my children. It is like coming home staying here as we are always made to feel so welcome. We love the new Coral Room perfect for a drink before going out or for lunch. The hotel is in a great location with Oxford Street  very close and a short walk to Covent Garden. We can't wait to come again...you never let us down.,5,2018,01,08
115,excellent location with friendly staff,"We stayed in London, visiting our son. This hotel is in an excellent location, very close to all major attractions and theatres. we walked everywhere. The hotel bar is fantastic, cocktails were amazing and the service was great. Breakfast was excellent with choices from the continental buffet and hot a la carte menu. The staff in the hotel were exceptional. Rooms are small but very clean and well maintained. We will definitely be staying again.",5,2018,01,07
115,Relaxing overnight stay in a beautiful hotel,"We chose The Bloomsbury hotel due to its easy access to the west end theatres. The hotel turned out to be the highlight of our short stay in London.
From the moment we arrived, smart, friendly staff were there to greet us and show us to reception. Every member of staff we met either in reception along the corridors or in the restaurants were always friendly, and had a smile on their faces. The room we had a queen superior room was beautiful, clean and welcoming. The shower was fab and the complimentary toiletries were of a good standard. Loved the fact it had even provided a mist free mirror in the bathroom. The breakfast was of a high quality with plenty of choice both from the self service continental to the al a carte menu which offered a good selection of breakfasts from a good full English, to eggs benedict. We had forgotten to print off out return journey train tickets and the staff kindly printed this off for us at no extra charge. A fabulous hotel, whose fabulousness is largely down to its fabulous staff. Will definitely be back in the summer with my two daughters for a girlie shopping/theatre weekend. On my favs list.",5,2018,01,06
115,Lovely Decor,The Bloomsbury is very well located in this district. It is initially difficult to recognize the building because it does not face the street (you see the Concierge stand and then walk along side to get to the front entrance). The check-in clerk was a bit curt when she saw that I was a loyalty member but chose to book through Expedia. Otherwise all of the staff was so friendly and competent in their work (watching the bar tenders in the Coral Room was a delight). The rooms were well appointed and very clean. The food was very good and drinks in the Coral Room are not to be missed. We were disappointed that the Bar downstairs was closed during our 3 night stay.,4,2018,01,05
115,Wonderful and comfortable stay....,We finally end up to this hotel with a wonderful and comfortable stay in the middle celebration of Christmas Eve with my family and we really impressed in the early morning of our breakfast because all of the staff were really polite and very helpful when it comes of taking and serving the food. That is why we really recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to spend their getaway holiday this year and thank you so much again for all the staff who look after us during our stay.,5,2018,01,03
115,Great Service and Amazing Attention To detail!,We cannot say enough great things about this hotel! First off the location is perfect walking distance to the Underground and near by shopping on Oxford Street. The check-in staff were great and very attentive. Its was very busy when we checked in but they made us feel welcomed and took care of the process quickly and efficiently. Our room was cozy yet well laid out. They even had a welcome fruit basket waiting for us. The Coral Bar is a must see! Its absolutely beautiful inside and the staff was lovely. We will be back for sure. Great spot! Cheers!,5,2018,01,02
115,"Lovely, central hotel","Visited for my husbands special birthday. The hotel was great, they treated us both well and we even had a helium balloon and birthday cake when we arrived! Would definitely recommend! 

The hotel had recently been refurbished and we had no complaints. Breakfast was okay, little light on staffing. 

The Coral Bar was a lovely hotel bar, to relax and enjoy a cocktail or two! ",5,2018,01,02
115,"Perfect Location, Perfect Experience","From the moment we walked into The Bloomsbury, we felt that we had a little ""home away from home"".  The welcome staff made us feel wanted and valued from the time we walked in the door. The location was almost walkable to most of what we wanted to see and had on our agenda.   Our rooms were tidy and well-appointed, and our rooms were made up every day even though we were there over Christmas and left after 1:00 PM on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.  The concierge was exceptionally helpful with directions and securing soccer tickets for us.  The breakfast was exactly what we could want every morning.  The Coral Room was the perfect place to relax and unwind at the end of the day, and Dalloway Terrace was delicious.  This is a 4-star hotel with 5-star service.  I would absolutely stay again.",5,2018,01,02
115,NICE SURPRISE,"If you are looking for a place in central London close to all the shopping areas, theaters and restaurants this is it! A very nice, boutique-style hotel that is well-priced and it is beautifully decorated. It is a big hotel but you get a real sense of warmth and coziness when you are inside. I stayed in suite 414 and my only complaint is that the view outside my three windows wasn't perhaps the best view. Apart from that it was a very spacious and comfortable room with an even more spacious bathroom which was superbly designed. Both the room and the bathroom were also incredibly clean!",4,2018,01,01
115,Bloomin' good Hotel,"Nestled in a quiet corner of Bloomsbury just off Tottenham Court road lies this fantastic hotel which surpasses its reputation.

From the welcome we always received from the small army of front desk staff to the décor throughout to the roaring fire of the lounge, the main theme of this hotel is warmth. We have wanted to stay here for a number of years but it lies quite far above our usual budget, finally as a special birthday treat we arrived at the new entrance and immediately appreciated what we had been missing.

Our standard room was a good size with lush furnishings in a style all of its own, lovely bathroom with quality toiletries. Not a modern room by any means, except for air con and electric safe, but everything was clean and obviously well maintained. Comfort is key here, which we loved.

Unfortunately, during our relatively short stay, they hotel was celebrating the end of a refurbishment with a private function so we weren't able to experience its lauded restaurant. But if the food tastes half as good as the restaurant looked, I'm sure you wouldn't be disappointed.

Bloomsbury is a location we often pick to base our trips to London as its perfectly situated between Euston station and the city, plus its generally quieter and a little bit cheaper than other central areas. The Bloomsbury is definitely the jewel in the crown and would be happy to return whenever the budget allows.",5,2017,12,29
115,The bloomsbury hotel - excellent ,"I visited london with my two sons at Christmas, the hotel is excellent by all factors, service, location, fine staff, food, clean, looking out for the small details, nice and friendly.
Most recommended! ",5,2017,12,28
115,Great location & Comfortable,"I was really looking forward to our six night stay at the hotel, especially after reading the reviews on here. True, the location is excellent and you can walk just about everywhere in central London. True,  staff are friendly especially in the bar,  however there lacked something that would have improved my review, there was a personal touch missing that I would have expected, such as being greeted at the door as you come and go. It felt quite anonymous. 

The bar is spacious and comfortable, our room was fine, very little natural light & no external view...made for a quiet night’s sleep but was a bit gloomy. We did not use the restaurant for breakfast as £26 per head is a little outrageous. Several places close by serve a great breakfast for about £6! 

Lovely to have a little cake left for my birthday, that was much appreciated. 

All in all left feeling that it was a good place to stay but has room for improvement in some areas but would stay again.",4,2017,12,27
115,great hotel,I traveled from Australia to London for a conference. The staff in Bloomsbury are so friendly and the room is very comfortable and clean. The location is close to many attractive resorts. This is my second time staying in Bloomsbury.,5,2017,12,24
115,"This a great hotel with art deco styled rooms, great location as no need for taxis","This is a lovely hotel that has apparently been refurbished quite recently, so all new and fresh. The hotel has an art deco style with a great main bar on ground floor. We stayed at the hotel when we went to see Motown at Shaftesbury theatre, which is a short walk from the hotel.
We also when to Chinatown for a meal so nice to be able to just walk.
Lower ground floor bar is really good, highly recommended as it takes you back to an old styled jazz type of bar, very good indeed.
Only negative was the breakfast order to the room, but nothing serious.",5,2017,12,18
115,Celebrate our 35th Wedding Anniversary ,"Stopped 2 nights 15th & 16th Dec 2017 at The Bloomsbury, had a fantastic stay everyone was so friendly and when we came back to our room on the Friday night the young Lady on reception had put us some balloons and wrote a lovely message on the mirror wishing us a happy Anniversary, thank you it was lovely. The Hotel was great nice and clean everywhere. We only had breakfast on the Saturday which was really good. The room and bathroom was very nice, a little small but you expect this in London there was still plenty of room for us. I would recommend this hotel it is in a fantastic position for theatres and shopping etc. No taxi ‘s to pay for all in walking distance. It only took us 25 mins to stroll to Euston station.",5,2017,12,17
115,Beautiful gem in an excellent location.,"Stayed here a couple of times now, once in a larger suite, the other time in a small but perfectly comfortable and nicely designed room.

The suite was stunning with contrasting wallpapers, stunning bathrooms and an extremely comfortable bed.

We ordered room service and I was stunned by the ""superfood salad"". We just meant to have something healthy, but we ended up loving this dish so much that we had the same the second time I stayed.

Not to forget about the staff: Very helpful and friendly in beautiful uniforms.

Needless to say, I will be back to stay, but this time around also to try the restaurants and the bar. Overall the hotel well worth the money.",5,2017,12,13
115,Christmas in London,"Lovely hotel, room not huge for the price but very comfortable. Breakfast amazing. Great location for the tube and walkable to lots of things. Would definitely recommend , beautiful seating area and bar and outside area lovely.",5,2017,12,11
115,Poor,"The hotel is in great location and has been decorated beautifully however I was utterly disappointed! I stayed in a superior deluxe room at £311 per night. 

The bathroom was covered in a layer of dust so had clearly not been cleaned recently. My friend and I woke up with allergic reactions to the dust which on inspection was also covering the wooden bedstead. 

The Dalloway restaurant was also poor. We asked for sparkling water and got given tap water, we asked for sparkling wine, which took a couple of requests before getting it, half an hour later. They ran out of kale as a side order for my friend but I had it in my salad, so the food was clearly not freshly prepared. We saw lots of food sent back. Our food was adequate but nothing to write home about. The restaurant was terribly cold and the blankets offered did little to help against the flapping cold plastic doors. 

The reason I’m writing this review, is that for a 4* hotel, the staff didn’t even politely listen when I tried to tell them about the cleaning on checking out. I was telling them in the hope they would make sure the room was adequate for the next residents. 

It was the second time I have stayed here, the first time was in a large suite. I won’t be back again as I am just too disappointed! ",1,2017,12,11
115,Fantastic service ,The staff in bloomsbury are awesome. I’ll stay there again. The service is excellent. It made our trip memorable. I’ll will definitely recommend this to my friends and family. The location is very central. The bar and food is fabulous great ambience. ,5,2017,12,10
115,A lovely hotel,"This hotel gives you personal service. The staff are excellent and very helpful, the bar area is chic and very pleasant . The rooms are quiet and comfortable. The restaurant area feels more like a Swiss city break than central London and I can thoroughly recommend the lounge area by the fire. ",4,2017,12,09
115,My first visit to the Coral Room ,"I Went to the Coral Room for a morning coffee, as It was recommended to me by my colleagues. Whilst I was sat at the bar, I was welcomed by a lovely bartender called Stefan ; He was very attentive and made sure that I was well looked after. I'm looking forward to coming back and experiencing the evening atmosphere! ",5,2017,12,06
115,"Great central location, good service","Stayed here due to a company seminar, and wanted to see the Christmas lights in oxford street, excellent location, friendly staff, lovely rooms, they even upgraded me, comfortable bed, big bath, just perfect,, try a cocktail in the coral bar,, lovely",5,2017,12,06
115,Service did not go with price,"The water in bath tub can not go out properly. Talked to reception every day however it was fixed until the third day. In breakfast, you need to remind them many times for tea. No concerige around. Need to hand carry the luggage through the ladder. ... too many details to show that the service was bad",1,2017,12,06
115,Exceptional Customer Service,I stayed at the Bloomsbury for a business trip in November 2017. The staff is exceptionally friendly and attentive. The room was comfortable and clean and the breakfast was delicious. Only complaint is that it was a bit difficult to get dinner aside from room service. It may be helpful if the in room documents provided a bit more detail about where you can get food since the two bars don't actually serve anything other than appetizers. ,5,2017,12,05
115,Outstanding Service,"A short stay at this hotel whilst unfortunately working and therefore did not get the true benefit of what it could offer - so will definitely be back on a leisure break to take full advantage !
However, we had a late check-in on the day of arrival and were exhausted, but the hotel staff were absolutely fabulous and made us feel totally welcome and at ease, and we were even given an upgrade on our room which was brilliant and totally unexpected.  Also despite it being very late and us having an early departure on our last day - the staff ensured that we had room service, even before the kitchen opened.
A beautiful hotel, situated in an excellent spot for access to the centre of London and its surrounding area.
Looking forward to our return.",5,2017,12,04
115,Bloomsbury for London,"I have stayed at the Bloomsbury primarily because I was attending a seminar that would take place at the same hotel so it was convenient.  However, it proved to be an excellent choice in all aspects: service, breakfast, dining, etc. as well as location which is very central and close to anywhere you might wish to go for in Central London.  The room was not big but sufficiently sized and clean and so the bathroom was.  Taking into account the location, I would also say it is not expensive either.",5,2017,12,04
115,"The Bloomsbury, great experience","Loved this hotel, would go back again.  I was there with my daughter and we enjoyed a fabulous high tea in the lounge!  Staff was gracious, rooms were clean and well furnished , hotel was near many attractions and Oxford Street.  I have not stayed elsewhere in London as this was my first visit, but this hotel had all I hoped for and was reasonably priced.  Our dinner in the patio restaurant was excellent and the breakfasts offered a good variety of selections.  The staff were just great! We were sad to leave!",5,2017,12,03
115," My Favourite Hotel in London","I often stay in London on business. This means I normally stay in large chain hotels as you know what you get. However I did have the pleasure of staying at The Bloomsbury. I picked it out because of the location which is great because it is so central. It has a great ambiance. The rooms, whilst small, are perfectly appointed. So when there is availability I would pick this over any other central London hotel I know I will never be disappointed!!",5,2017,12,02
115,Fantastic stay,"The service was top notch, with an upscale bar and restaurant. Walking distance to most of London’s top attractions. The only part that wasn’t great was the room size - relatively small, but had everything you need. We would definitely stay again.",5,2017,12,01
115,November visit,"My first visit here will not be the last.This is a very elegant and sophisticated hotel, fully deserving its 4 stars, with a cool and classy bar, elegant furnishings and well appointed rooms with extremely comfortable beds. The location, very close to Oxford Street and the British museum, will suit the tastes of very different client groups.",4,2017,12,01
115,Delightful,"We stayed one night at the Bloomsbury on our way back to New Zealand. We checked our bags in early and were told our room was ready at 10.00am which was fantastic.  The receptionist was lovely and gave us a map of London and pointed us the way to the underground. Breakfast was excellent. Unfortunately I had developed a cold and had lost my voice. The waitress was very concerned and brought me a hot lemon drink with ginger and honey and also asked after breakfast if it had helped, such a personal service. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Bloomsbury, the staff are so caring and attentive. It's in a great position close to the theatres and Tottenham Court Station and the bed was very comfortable. ",5,2017,11,30
115,Back again..,We returned to the Bloomsbury recently for a belated honeymoon weekend.  Our previous visit was in August 2016.  Both stays the staff and service were fantastic.  We would recommend The Bloomsbury for a relaxing romantic weekend.,5,2017,11,30
115,Conference ,"Beautiful venue. Kind, friendly and helpful staff. Fantastic service. Excellent food and great facilities. Really loved the little break out areas where people could relax or work. I can recommend the venue and hotel without any reservation. ",5,2017,11,29
115,The Coral Room at the Bloomsbury Hotel,"Had a fantastic experience at the new Coral Room in the bloomsbury, lovely art deco feel about it. 
Amazing service from the doorman James upon entering, and was met by kind smiling faces happy to seat us comfortably. Exceptional waiting uniform worn by all staff, and impeccable customer service particularly from Kevin and Giovanni. 
Will definitely be back for more cote du rhone and lobster mac n' cheese!",5,2017,11,28
115,Birthday treat,This was a special event for us as it was my birthday and we  had left 4 children at home so we needed a complete rest.  We certainly got that at The Bloomsbury.  So much so that we didn't want to leave after just one night.  We even came back early from the theatre in order to enjoy a nightcap on the terrace and then to sit by the fire in the beautiful sitting room.  We loved this hotel so much we actually don't want to share it with anyone - in fact we felt that we were in a small boutique hotel rather than a 150 bedroom one.  Everything was exceptional from the warm welcome to the attitude of the staff and the beautiful decor.  We could not find a fault with anything and nothing was too much trouble.  We wish we had booked for more than one night but we will definitely be back for much longer next time.  Thank you so much to the wonderful team at The Bloomsbury - a very special gem in the heart of London.  ,5,2017,11,27
115,Feeling part of the family!,"If you want to be ""looked after"" with a smile then this is the place to come. Staff are the best, clearly passionate about making your stay a wonderful experience. Rooms incredible, comfortable and ""homely"". Breakfast staff ""warmed"" my heart..... MARINA, MARIA, IONUT and ESTELITA ...... they helped set my day up to be a great one, THANKS SO MUCH!",5,2017,11,26
115,Charming from start to finish,"You could stay at The Ritz, but why? The Bloomsbury has everything. The art of true customer service has been lost on many hotels of late, but The Bloomsbury has revived it exponentially. I'm so glad that I heeded the Tripadvisor reviews of this lovely hotel and took a chance staying here. As numerous reviewers have said, they greet you like a special friend and treat you as such for your entire stay. From the front desk to the concierge, wait staff, and housekeeping, they went that extra mile to make me feel welcome and to anticipate any and all needs I might have.

The rooms themselves are cozy and comfortable. I had a superior queen room. It was not luxurious, but it was thoughtfully furnished with lots of storage and small touches like plenty of electrical outlets (that fit U.S. plugs as well as other international types), cookies when I arrived and a hand-written note offering complimentary bar bites. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've had in any hotel. The general atmosphere of the hotel is elegant and eclectic without pretense. References to the eponymous artistic circle are scattered throughout, and there are many comfortable places to drink, dine, chat, or sit and read. The atmosphere encourages relaxation and lingering.

In short (and long), The Bloomsbury takes customer service seriously. It's like home, but better--and at a great value. There's no reason to look any further, so book a stay. You won't be disappointed!",5,2017,11,25
115,40th weekend in London,"The Bloomsbury is one of those places in London where you just know you are going to be well looked after. This trip was no different, all the staff were very helpful and go above and beyond to ensure you have a relaxing stay.
We arrived in town early on the 10th September @9am, phoned the hotel to check our reservation, we were way to early for the room, but were invited to drop our luggage in early. We did this and all the paperwork, meaning we just arrived back later in the day and were able to go straight up to our room. After a long day walking the streets of London, we arrived in our room which was immaculate and very generous in size. We almost didn't go out in the evening!
After a good nights sleep and an excellent breakfast we headed for Waterloo and the train home.
I cannot recommend this hotel enough, we are already looking forward to returning again in the future.",5,2017,11,23
115,Bloomsbury,"Excellent hotel, very close to theatre land, service with a smile, the staff cold not be more helpful. Very clean rooms, facilities outstanding, we will use this hotel every time we come to the theatre!",5,2017,11,20
115,Excellent Style and Service,Excellent hotel close to West End and Oxford street with a high level of service. Rooms are rather small but very well styled and equipped. The hotel has a relaxed atmosphere supported by surprising style and design. Highly recommend!,5,2017,11,20
115,Small rooms but not too bad for London standards,"Coming from Asia, I'm spoilt with huge well appointed rooms. So the room and service at the Bloomsbury are good by London standard, but fair by international business boutique hotel standards. We had a conference in the hotel and the rooms were quite stuff. The guest rooms were snug but quite comfortable. ",3,2017,11,19
115,Friendly and very accommodating Staff,"I needed to give a review and a special shout out to Maria and her team at breakfast.  They are all super friendly especially Ionut who is always one step ahead and really make's you feel special - hope you see this Ionut!  I visit often and have never had such a wonderful breakfast experience in any other hotel I have visited.
Thank you all and see you again soon!
Helen",5,2017,11,19
115,Delightful stay,"Arrived much earlier than expected and was delighted to find my room was ready and that i could check in early. The staff were extremely accommodating, professional and courteous. The room was lovely, well equipped and spotless. The bed very comfy. I chose this hotel for location and ambiance and was not disappointed in the least! My stay of two nights included breakfast which was also very well done and the staff tremendous, a special shout out to Maria who greeted every morning personally and with a smile. I spent a little time in other areas of the hotel and found the same. Hard to be beat I would guess. The only mini minor hiccup was that the room across the hall was having a carpet replaced at a time when I wanted to rest up for the evening and it was very noisy i would have appreciated a heads up from the front desk or maybe a cup of tea!",5,2017,11,18
115,100% awesome ,"Exactly what is expected from a 5 star hotel.

115,Very Comfortable Stay,"We stayed here our last two nights of an 11-day tour of the UK. It was certainly one of the cleanest places we stayed, furnishings fresh and modern. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, and our two dinners there were excellent. Breakfast was just as good; unfortunately, we had to leave so early on the last day that we were able to enjoy the breakfast only once. The only problem we encountered was with the design of the shower door -- it wasn't possible to close it properly, so the floor got wet with every use. Luckily, we had plenty of towels. Based on our report, hopefully management will be able to correct the problem.",5,2017,11,14
115,"Fabulous Hotel, Lovely Staff, Great Location","I booked this hotel as we were in London meeting family to celebrate my wife's 60th birthday.
From making the initial booking till our departure the service from the Bloomsbury team was absolutely first class! There were also some nice personal touches as it was a special occasion and we both really appreciated this. The central location was ideal for us and limited the need for taxis, the underground at Tottenham Court Road is only a short walk away. Istvan (from Budapest) was on the front entrance and we found him to be a particularly friendly, helpful and courteous young man.",5,2017,11,14
115,A delight,"I found myself smiling all the time at this hotel. I was looked after by a lovely beardy Portuguese man and a black guy from Africa and they were so helpful and charming and professional. 

I admit that there was a chair in front of my bed when I got into the room so my bed was quite inaccessible. The restaurant was also quite cold despite the heating and blankets, but I didn’t care because the staff were adorable. 

Thanks so much. Splendid. 

🏅🏅🏅",5,2017,11,13
115,Charming hotel in perfect location,"This is a delightful hotel - clean, quaint, and well staffed.  The Dalloway Terrace is a very good restaurant.  Location-wise, you cannot do better.  Steps from the tube, and near the British Museum, Russell Square, various academic institutions.  Far better, and not much more expensive, than the touristy places near the Russell Square tube stop.",5,2017,11,12
115,A wonderful gem in the city of London!,I was amazed by the supreme quality of service and atmosphere this hotel has to offer. Stayed there for 2 nights and even tried the hotel's bars. The rooms are extremely tidy and comfortable. The several bars have unique atmospheres and wonderful food and drink selection. Make sure to try some of their cocktails! Unforgettable experience. Thanks again!,5,2017,11,11
115,Wonderful hotel and wonderful staff,"Stayed here for 2 nights as I had a conference to attend at GOSH. Firstly, was very well located for getting to GOSH, which was a very leisurely short walk away. And in the other direction you have easy access to the West End, Oxford Street and Leicester Square. The room was comfortable although a bit on the small side, especially the bathroom. But it still served its purpose. Was delighted to be greeted also by a lovely card and fruit platter. These extra touches add to the overall experience. One final thing I would like to mention is the very helpful and super friendly staff from arrival to departure. A special mention goes to the very handsome male concierge staff in their elegant beige coats ;)
Overall I enjoyed my stay and would recommend it to friends/family",5,2017,11,09
115,"My first time in London, an excellent experience","Well located (just a few meters from Tottenham Court, a couple of hundred meters from the British Museum), very comfortable, excellent rooms and service room and a wonderfull breakfast!!!! I stayed 10 wonderfull days in London and in this hotel.",5,2017,11,08
115,Worderful,"We had a great stay, the room was very nice comfortable and spacious, modern facilities, very clean and cozy.
The restaurant staff was great, they explained all the menu to us, and were flexible to our requirements.
At the bar we had a great experience. We've tried two amazing cocktails (one been a mocktail), and some finger food from the menu, that was delicious.
The night manager JC was very welcoming and helped us with our requests.
Everything went smooth and we had an amazing time in London, also thanks to the Bloomsbury staff!",5,2017,11,08
115,"Utterly Charming, Super Staff","For my first trip to London, the Bloomsbury was a wonderful experience.  Well-located, cozy but not cramped rooms, fantastic breakfast, and great bar/lounge areas and terrace restaurant. If you have a literary bent, I can't recommend this place more highly and where else can you find a cocktail menu based on the members of the Bloomsbury Circle?   

But what really set this place apart was the superb staff.  They could not have been more friendly and helpful - a special shout out to Sebastian who rescued me from an electrical-conversion nightmare.

Only down side was the w.c. -- bathtub has a high ridge and can be difficult to get in and out of if you have mobility issues -- and the shower controls were a bit baffling.  

Would happily return here.",5,2017,11,07
115,Another excellent stay ,Yet again another excellent stay at this lovely hotel and was made even better by seeing the new coral lounge bar area which opens this week it really puts the hotel on the map the new coral lounge was amazing to see the new reception is now at the side of the hotel which is nice we had a lovely room and the breakfast was very nice as always love going for cocktails in the bar will be giving the outside bar a visit next time as well this hotel is well worth a stay we stay here twice a year and it never disappoints along with the great service from the staff back in March 18 for another great stay and to have drinks in the new coral lounge 😁,5,2017,11,07
115,So Comfortable!,"Off the beaten track, but so close to Tottenham Court Road, it feels right on it! Great position in Central London with a really decent price a for really comfortable room. Good basement bar and a very nice breakfast. Perfect. My only gripe would be the noisy plumbing in room 401..... but thats a first world problem isn't it?",4,2017,11,06
115,worst bed (mattress) i ever slept on,"the most uncomfortable mattress i ever slept on. 
both me and my wife couldn't sleep well, and when you fly 5 hours and spend so much money for a weekend, you want it to be the most indulging and comfortable as possible.
and even when i couldn't sleep well and tried watching TV, it was a problem, since the TV at room 615 is at the same high as the bed, so your legs are blocking half of the screen...
and there are some other things, that i could live with, if it was just them alone, like some HD channels that are not really HD, and no option to put your water at the refrigerator, unless you ask for one.....
we finished our wedding 10th anniversary holiday very dissapointed! ",1,2017,11,06
115,Love this hotel!,"I've travel to London every six weeks for the past two years, and have tried a variety of hotels in proximity to City of London where my office is located. The Bloomsbury Hotel consistently stands out a a first-rate experience in its price range. Not only a great place on business I would certainly pick the Bloomsbury over anything else when coming to London on vacation.

First - the area is really top rate. Near Tottenham Court Rd Tube Station, it's an easy walk into the best of Soho while being pleasantly apart from the crowds. Also next to the British Museum, across the street from London's original YMCA (if you are looking for a full service gym) and probably the perfect jumping off point for anything in London.

But the hotel itself is what makes it special. The hotel caters to the senses with gentle incense in the lobby, great bath soaps, and tastefully done rooms and bathrooms. The morning buffet in the restaurant is a bit pricey - there are great quick alternatives in little marts all near the hotel - but can be a nice treat when wanting something convenient and a bit more extravagant. A well stocked gym and attractive lobby with high tea hour round out all the amenities one needs. Across the street is a very nice Indian restaurant with Turkish and many other alternatives nearby.

Now that they've moved the front entrance they've solved my one complaint which was having to carry your bag up the front stairs without a ramp. Coming in the side seems a bit awkward but it does mean that no detail has been overlooked.

While there are better hotels there is nothing that comes close in downtown London for this price - don't even try.",5,2017,11,05
115,"Amazing hotel, excellent service","Wonderful stay in this place, it was our wedding night and the extra touches the staff did for us were lovely. 
Our room was so comfortable, there were black out blinds which meant that we had a very solid sleep. Sadly we were only staying for one night but hope to return for a stay in the future on an anniversary for example. Thank you Bloomsbury Hotel. ",5,2017,11,05
115,Fantastic staff,"This hotel is well located and offers easy access to shops and tourist attractions. Our room (505) was well appointed but very compact as you could not swing the proverbial cat but had all you could need. The staff were very attentive and proactive without being over baring and a great breakfast was offered in a lovely setting.
A hotel well worth considering and we would use it again.",4,2017,11,01
115,"Great central location. An interesting Lutyens building, refitted with style for the 21st century.","Good value for money, given its perfect location for central London. 2 minutes from the Dominion theatre. Very good standard of room. Extremely friendly helpful staff. Excellent breakfast with plenty of choice.",5,2017,10,29
115,4.5 really.  Really pleasant stay.  Great service and breakfast,"All the employees were nice and helpful - that is the main point.
The room was pleasant - smaller than in U.S., of course.
One negative in the bathroom - for taking a shower, the standing service of the tub was too sloped, too narrow, and needed those stick-on things to reduce slipperyness.
Oh, maybe the rooms were not insulated as well as they might have been against noise - not really a problem...
We signed up for the ""a la carte breakfast"" (the most expensive option, about $34 per person per day).  But it was delicious, lots of fresh fruit and other options, the service was fast, the a la carte choices (like omelette, French toast, ...) arrived quickly.
The entrance was nice - greenery, and terrace cafe on both sides of the steps.  (The main entrance was being worked on - maybe they will make the side entrance the new main entrance...).
You can have a paper delivered to your door - it costs a little bit.
No microwave, no room in the fridge because is filled with items that you can purchase (expensive of course).",5,2017,10,29
115,Brilliant hotel!,"We loved our 3 night stay at the Bloomsbury.   We splurged and got the suite, which was beautiful.  The room was spacious, with a comfy bed and big bathroom.  The hotel and room are exactly as described/pictured.

The hotel location was perfect - in that it's close to the major sights but in a really lovely quiet street. It's 2 mins away from oxford street, a 5-10 min walk to covenant garden and close to the tube station. 

The service was great, as the people at the front desk and concierge were helpful and friendly at all times.

I loved our stay here and would highly recommend.  Can't wait to return!",5,2017,10,29
115,"The location is great, but it's the staff that makes The Bloomsbury special","This was the 4th year our group stayed at The Bloomsbury and the service just keeps getting better and better.  The staff here is excellent and will make you feel right at home.  The location is wonderful - close to everything, including the Tube, but on a quiet side street.  The bar and restaurant are wonderful - the food and drinks are excellent and the service is even better. The guest rooms are large, especially for central London standards and the amenities are superior.  The luxurious linens and marble baths are so welcome at the end of a long day. I highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2017,10,27
115,A haven of hospitality in busy London,"We have stayed here before and are fans. We stayed again and felt very welcome. It is just a very comfortable hotel. This is rather a good location in London whatever you are interested in. The refurbishments caused us no problem at all. We're just keen to see what that wonderful front hall will look like when they are finished. We'll be back. 
Our suggestion: try the basement bar in the front. We rather liked it!",5,2017,10,26
115,Perfect (with one minor gripe),"Stayed here at the end of a four week European holiday.  We have visited London many times, at first staying with friends and then moving on to hotels.  This was our first time at The Bloomsbury and provided we can afford it, it won't be the last.  Brilliant location within walking distance to Soho and the West End which was perfect as we rarely leave this part of the city.  

Didn't eat or drink at the hotel but that was more because we simply ran out of time.  The terrace looked very inviting though.

We were lucky enough to get a deal were we had a suite for three nights but only paid for two.  Still very expensive when spending Australian dollars but it's London and we know what to expect.  I actually think what we got for what we paid was very good value.  I've not had as big a room in London ever.

When we stayed there was construction still occurring but really this didn't worry us too much.  It just blends in with the general noise of a large city.

Our only gripe was on our final morning.  Housekeeping knocked on the door very early (maybe 8ish).  This seemed to be very early for us but in a way we could have prevented this by playing the Do Not Disturb sign on the door.  Apart from that, the stay was perfect.

As mentioned - would definitely return next time we're in London, funds permitting.",5,2017,10,26
115,Long Weekend in London,"The hotel is located in a very strategic location' you can walk almost to any place in the city.
The people are very friendly.
We stayed in the Deluxe room which are very nice.
The only drawback is that there is no room to put your clothes as the cabinet does have only one drawer.",4,2017,10,26
115,A great stay at The Bloomsbury,Although a refurbishment is in progress my wife and I had a wonderful stay and an excellent nights sleep. We also had a lovely snack on the terrace at lunchtime and I thoroughly recommend a late night club sandwich!,5,2017,10,24
115,Lovely room awful view,Stayed here 1 night and upgraded to a superior room the room was spotless and had plenty of storage. When we entered the room the blinds were drawn and by the time we opened them the staff had gone and I could see why the outlook was onto a half empty office building and 16 yes 16 overflowing industrial size rubbish bins my wife rang reception to see if any other room was available and was told they would speak to the manager. We heard nothing and called at reception as we went to dinner again no news they eventually contacted us at 10.45 to say we could move to another room but as we were only there for the night my wife refused. If we had had the option when originally asked we would have moved but by 11pm what was the point.  We had payed for a superior room and expected something a bit above the norm this was not what we got. Great location but not worth the price if this is generally the standard they provide.,3,2017,10,23
115,Ecellent Stay in a Great Location,"We have just finished an exceptional week in London, thanks in great measure to The Bloomsbury hotel’s location and to an excellent stay at The Bloomsbury's outstanding team led by Duty Manager Sebastian Allendale.  It got off to a bumpy start which Sebastian solved with great aplomb. The receptionists were always polite and the concierge staff The with a capital: The!inside and outside the hotel offered their help with kind attention,  The breakfast crew led by Estelita were always swift to help as were her other colleagues.  The Dalloway under Daff’s leadership were similarly excellent.
The hotel is undergoing changes, and has lost its delightful garden area and lovely lobby to  the trendier London of today: the old lobby is now a bar - but after all I am an old fogey…..
It is our hotel in London.  We returned this time, and hope to be back again,
PS Do not confuse with other hotels with “Bloomsbury” in its name. ( And make sure the superior room you book is not one of the newer less attractive ones.)  This hotel is called The Bloomsbury.",5,2017,10,23
115,Quiet oasis amongst all the hubbub,"The hotel is located in a cracking spot for Theatreland, Soho or just about every other West End experience. We had one of the rooms which faces into the central courtyard area, and as a result it was nearly silent! Although the room was quite small is was very well appointed and extremely comfortable. We perhaps didn't see the hotel in its full grandeur as there were building works going on during our stay (although these did not compromise our stay in any way at all). The staff were all extremely cheerful & we have no hesitation in awarding 5 out of 5.",5,2017,10,22
115,Amazing ,"Booked hotel as a surprise birthday present for parents and staff were absolutely amazing, room was beautiful, great location. Amazing hotel. Breakfast in bed was delicious. Will book again. Thank you Bloomsbury team ",5,2017,10,21
115,traditional stay,"Thanks to all the staffs for their hospitality.  My room was not so big but well decorated. Enjoyed the bar in basement. In some areas I found it bit costly. They are charging for unusual things. But they could have to minimize those.. 
hope to visit again.",4,2017,10,17
115,What an experience!,"Having stayed in many hotels in London over the years this was unexpected pleasant - in absolutely every way! For the first time ever I was really considering NOT to review a hotel on TA, and keep the secret to myself.

But that would have been unfair, so here I go:
STAFF - wonderful service and extremely helpful. The concierge even helped us to make a reservation at Hakkasan (that was fully booked that night). Superb express check out.
ROOMS - Bigger than most centrally located hotels usually has. Wonderful bed, nice air, minbar, complimentary water, in-room safe and great bathrooms. Perfect for the two of us. Also completely silent during the night - in the middle of London.
LOCATION - Perfect. Oxford Street next door for the girls, Soho and Covent Garden a short walk away.
BREAKFAST - Wonderful breakfast and attentive staff. You walk into a breakfast restaurant in every way, not just a place to have breakfast. Great cold buffet and possibility to order what ever hot breakfast you wanted. Also aboundance of healthy options! Kudos.
MOST IMPRESSIVE - the restaurants and bar of the hotel. Unlike any we've ever seen before. Cosy and romantic beyond imagination. The biggest surprise of our stay!
DALLOWAY TERRACE - partly sheltered by see-through walls for the winter. Super place for afternoon tea - very british!
BLOOMSBURY CLUB BAR - our favourite bar in London from now on! Superb service and great cocktails and an ambiance that we really enjoyed. Unformal, but still with a lot of style. We liked the ""outside"" seating the most - being the most romatic bar we have ever visited.

Looking forward to our next London-visit!",5,2017,10,16
115,Nearly flawless,"Great location, amazing and helpful staff in every department, lovely outside space, very atmospheric bar in the basement, and all in all a very good experience.
However, there were a few niggles that they need to sort out in my opinion; on arrival, and prior to me going off to a business meeting, we sat outside and had two very acceptable glasses of Provencal Rose wine, we were offered some nuts and/or olives too...we opted for the nuts. Now in every hotel we have ever stayed in all over the world whenever you order drinks/cocktails, you are always given some type of nibbles to enjoy with the said drink... imagine my surprise when on the bill we were charged £2.50 for the nuts! I was shocked, if they want to charge for it, why not add £1 on the cost of the drink and just give the nuts as complimentary. The second thing was, as this was a business stay, I had booked two rooms, a superior double for me and my wife, and a twin room for the other two guests. We paid the same price for each room, our's was tiny to say the least, with no bath tub simply a shower, our guests had a huge twin room with a bath tub as well as a shower. Now, given that I had paid the same rate for both, I would have thought the rooms should have been comparable in size and facilities. In saying that, there was nothing wrong with our room overall, just very small and no bath tub.
I would return to this hotel however, but would be very careful on the room type I booked.",4,2017,10,14
115,Awesome stay. Great location,"The hotel is located close to the British Museum - a walking distance from main attraction and shopping areas. An underground station and many bus stations are nearby. Excellent location when visiting London. 
The rooms were clean, comfortable and well equipped. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Breakfast in the hotel is good but expensive. There are so many good places nearby for breakfast.
We stayed for a week and loved this place.",5,2017,10,13
115,GOOD LOCATION FOR THEATRE,"Twin room was clean,  spacious, and with comfy chair and table.  Bathroom good size, clean and towels good quality and size.
.

Turn down service good and robes and slippers left out on beds plus chocolates and milk and cookies for my young granddaughter.

All in all a great stay and the staff with whom we had contact were extremely good and knowledgeable.

Whilst I have stated that the hotel is  not mid-range price-wise (under 'Hotel Style & Amenities' - it is mid-range for London.  A good place to stay",4,2017,10,11
115,A Blooming Jolly Place to Stay to Enjoy London,"The Bloomsbury Hotel, part of the Doyle Collection of boutique hotels, turned out to be a very enjoyable choice. This boutique hotel in the Bloombury District made the perfect headquarters. We were welcomed warmly and shown to a cozy and well appointed room. The bed was comfortable, the room quiets and surrounding quite pleasant. The location is near major Tube stations and surrounded by shopping, dining and entertainment. We felt the value was spot on.",4,2017,10,11
115,A hotel at the heart of theatre land,"Don't expect the palatial reception area, what you get is a well staffed desk with people who care a great deal about your stay. They looked after luggage while we wandered. Went out in the rain to get a black cab. The rooms are a good size for London and our shower room was massive. We didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening but the breakfast and the service where first class. We will be back.",5,2017,10,11
115,Fantastic Service,"Excellent stay. Minor issue with a package that was not mine in room on arrival - solved quickly and professionally by the staff. For such a minor issue I did not expect any upgrade but was given one without asking - thank you! 
Very attentive in the restaurant. Staff in restaurant and hotel took the effort to remember my name. Overall one of the most best hotels I have stayed in. Would definitely recommend. ",5,2017,10,11
115,Great Stay! Amazing Accommodations & Staff,"We absolutely loved the Bloomsbury and would stay there again in a heartbeat. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. The accommodations were clean, thoughtful and very comfortable. The location is great (quiet but close to major sites). The decor is fun but not too posh that it is alienating. We would highly recommend staying at the Bloomsbury and plan to stay there again next time we are in London.",5,2017,10,10
115,Underwhelming & disappointing,"I'm a frequent international business traveler so I tend to know my hotels. I stayed here a few times while in London, and my previous stays were good. And front desk service has been consistently good. However my last visit here was sad & disappointing. 

First bad experience: They ran out of hot water in the morning while I was soaping up. I was rushing to catch an important meeting so I had to suck it up and take a cold (and  I don't mean luke warm, I mean tap cold) shower that morning, I notified the front desk, and they send someone up supposedly to address it, but by then I was running out to work, so it was too late. This shouldn't have happened, period. Also weird was that they made no offer of apology and an effort to make it right (for instance, a note on my desk from the hotel manager apologizing that day would be nice). 

Second bad experience was with housekeeping: On my first day I spilled some food and drink on my bathrobe so I left it on the bathroom floor to be replaced. I was shocked to find that robe hung back up when I came back to my room! This is such a basic thing, so I thought Ok maybe they accidentally missed it. So the same dance next day - I left it on the bathroom floor, under other dirty towels to make it very clear this is dirty. And what do I find when I come back? It was just hung back up again, as dirty and stained, at the end of the day! 

All in all this is not what i expect from a luxury hotel. My experience was more like a 3-star hotel pretending to be a luxury one.",2,2017,10,10
115,Very nice!,"My husband and I stayed here at the end of a tour through the UK. The room was clean and comfortably appointed. Actually larger than we expected it to be! Modern appliances in the bathroom. Robe and slippers provided. We took full advantage of the Nespresso machine. They provide a great power bar for international travellers, including space for a grounded American plug with voltage conversion. Our laptop survived! 

There was some construction going on at the time, but we were placed well away from any noise. 

Sampled some tasty concoctions at the Bloomsbury Club Bar. I suggest other visitors do the same! 

Enjoyed our stay!",5,2017,10,09
115,The Bloomsbury,"Excellent hotel with exceptional service! Great location within walking distance of all the London attractions. The staff are very friendly and nothing is too much to ask.
The decor is beautiful throughout the hotel.",5,2017,10,09
115,It was ok,"Very good location good
Service was poor and very slow
Shower was poor it did not refresh us
Lighting in the room was odd as it was difficult to do my makeup 💄 
It was disorganised 
And no tv signal 
Altogether to a 5* it was poor 
I very rarely give a poor review ",3,2017,10,07
115,Brilliant service at every turn,"We have just stayed for 7 nights at The Bloomsbury and cannot commend them more highly for the outstanding service we received. On arrival we were greeted very warmly and upgraded from a Superior Queen to a Superior King room. It was very comfortable, well equipped, quiet and had a lovely heated floor in the bathroom. Soon after our arrival we were presented with chocolate covered strawberries and a card wishing us a happy anniversary. We had a lovely dinner in the Dalloway Terrace and, as were getting ready to leave, were treated to a lovely chocolate dessert with a “ Happy Anniversary” message. We were feeling very spoilt by the lovely girls there and it was only day one ! The breakfast offered so many delicious options and the service was exceptional - both extremely efficient and very good natured. Our room was always well and unobtrusively  maintained. The position is easy for train travel or walking to Covent Garden, Soho, Oxford St. We absolutely loved the Bloomsbury and would stay here again. ",5,2017,10,07
115,BLOOMSBURY RECAP,"We loved the location, friendly staff,comfy beds and rooms AND the fabulous breakfasts. Just a little 
sad that the main lobby was still under renovation and we didn't get to experience it....Next time!",5,2017,10,07
115,London for the holidays,"We loved our room, the lobby and the hotel restaurant.  It's got a handy location to the tube and walking distance to the British Museum.  And the decorations for the holidays were just lovely.  I've stayed at many London hotels for business.  This time it was on my dime and I could not have been happier with my choice.",5,2017,10,04
115,"Centrally Located, Top Notch Hotel","I had a wonderful stay at the Bloomsbury this summer. As a female traveling alone for business, I wanted a quiet, safe hotel, walking distance from my office, which is exactly what I found here. Furthermore, the room was pristine, comfortable and allowed me to recuperate after some long days of travel. I can't say enough good things about the staff here - among the best service I have experienced across other hotels in Europe and the US. They gave me a warm welcome, and made sure everything was taken care of during my stay. The bell hops and concierges were especially helpful any time I had a question, whether it be how to walk somewhere else in the city, or how to arrange transportation back to the airport. Also, the restaurant, bar and room service was a very good option for nights I did not want to travel far for dinner or a drink. I will absolutely stay here again, whether returning for business or pleasure.",4,2017,10,04
115,Good Location,"We spent a week here recently and our feelings are very mixed.  The best thing going for this hotel is the location.  It is just around the corner from the underground and one block down from the British Museum.  The hotel is undergoing quite a bit of construction right now, which made it somewhat awkward to get around, but that will resolve itself.  The facility is quite beautiful and there is a nice sitting room off the lobby where you can sit when waiting for groups to gather or for a cab to arrive.  The rooms are quite small and the bathrooms even smaller.  Our bath was wide enough to accommodate a sink on one end and a toilet on the other, with a shower in an alcove which was difficult to get into because the sink was in the way.  There was no place to hang towels or store cosmetics.  There was no place to store our suitcases, which we piled behind a chair in the corner.  The bed was very comfortable and the linens were of high quality. Housekeeping was very good during the week, but weekends got a bit dicey.  Both couples had to ask for service at the end of the day. Breakfast is excellent, with both a full buffet and menu service as well, but I cannot recommend the restaurant.  We had dinner here our first night and all four of us were disappointed.  Two of us had steak, both medium rare, except one came well done and both were so tough we couldn't chew them.  The macaroni with lobster was too salty to eat, and the scallops with risotto turned out to be shrimp with some kind of rice - definitely not risotto.  To be fair, they comped us the price of the macaroni and lobster, but we stayed a week and never ate there again.  The best place to eat in the neighborhood is the Indian restaurant just across the street, the Malabar Junction.  There aren't many other good restaurants in the immediate area, but the tube is closeby and London is easy to get around in.  All in all, a very mixed stay.  Clean, comfortable beds - small rooms - good breakfast - don't eat dinner here!",4,2017,10,04
115,The Bloomsbury hotel,Great location for the west end of London. Really close to So Ho and the theatre district. The hotel is very clean and well run. The reception staff we're first rate and gave us a late complementary check out. Breakfast was very good with lots of options.,5,2017,10,03
115,Great location & staff,"First time visit to London and we were extremely happy with our hotel choice.  Lovely room, which I would think to be nice size for London.  Great bathroom with ample room.  We slept with the window open and felt the neighborhood was very quiet.  Walking distance to nice restaurants for breakfast & dinner.  Easy walk, tube (2-3 blocks) or bus ride to all attractions.  Great neighborhoods to explore.
Just a few blocks from British Museum, which is free and has suggested self tours depending on how long you would like to stay.  Staff was always ready to give recommendations.
Thank you!",5,2017,10,02
115,Tiny rooms at exhorbitant prices,"Don't take your cat as you will never have room to swing it , well not in the room my wife and I shared any way. This was the second room offered as the previous one was a converted cupboard !!!!!!
Shockingly overpriced even for London. We used the Hamyards for comestibles as this was a PROPER top rated hotel.",2,2017,10,02
115,Great Location,"The hotel is excellently located close to tube and was very easy to find. We arrived early and left bags with concierge and reception rang and let us know when rooms were ready. Rooms are nice but are on the small side. We had some large pieces of furniture which really aren't needed.  The other room our friends had was more spacious due to less clunky furniture. Overall rooms are nicely decorated and very comfy beds. The breakfast was excellent.  Only small downside was only one tiny pat of butter on table for 4 people so kept having to ask for more on both mornings. Concierge were very helpful and friendly and we booked a show and open top bus trip with them. On our first night we went downstairs to have a drink at the bar but couldn't access from inside hotel and had to go out front door and down stairs to hotel.  We were asked if we had a booking by the hostess with clipboard but we didn't.  She gave us a counter spot at bottom of stairs and  drinks menu.  We waited but there was no sign of service (even thought it really wasn't that busy) so we popped to bar near hotel instead. Doesn't seem to be suitable for popping in for quick drink, small disappointment, but loads of other places nearby.  We were able to walk to the show we booked and approx. 10 min walk to covent garden also which was lovely. The good points far outweigh any niggles and I would definitely recommend staying here and also will return when next in London",5,2017,10,02
115,Disappointing Stay & poor service,"I would just like to express the huge disappointment with our stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel last weekend on Saturday 30 September. I booked a 1 night stay for my partner and I to celebrate our anniversary with you however we both left feeling deflated, mis-sold and disappointed. 

On my confirmation email it states that check-in is at 15:00. We arrived at 15:20 expecting to be shown straight to our room however while Marion was taking our details at the reception desk we were advised that the cleaner was still in the room and would be another 10 minutes. They apologised and we were offered a drink in the lounge while we waited. We sat down and could see that the concierge had just left our suitcase out in the hallway with guests walking past and no one watching our bags. We waited in the lounge until 15:50 meaning that our check-in was almost an hour late. When our room was ready Marion came in to the lounge handed us the room key and said ‘your room is ready now’ not telling us what room we were in, where the lifts were, what they had done with our bags, in fact no service at all as I had to walk after her to retrieve our bags that they had just left!!

We also did not receive the coffee we were promised until we had got to the room and someone had to ask us if we received it or not! Obviously we were not particular happy considering we had arrived at what was meant to be a 5 star hotel in the middle of London and not received any service in the slightest! 

Once we had finally got to our room and had a look around it was nothing we had expected or indeed paid for!! I had booked the ‘Deluxe Room 1 Queen Bed’ which states on your website as the ‘Room Details’ which are as follows: Room size: 302 sq. ft / 28 sq. m (average), Free Wi-Fi (room & common areas), Marble bathrooms with heated floors, walk-in showers & separate baths, Nespresso coffee machine, Aromatherapy Associates bathroom amenities, 40"" flat screen TV, Sky Sports Channels 1-5, BT Sports Channels 1-4.

In our room (520) there were not heated floors in the bathroom, there was not a 40” TV (this was 28” instead) and the 1 and only reason I booked this room is because of the separate bath and walk-in shower which we definitely did not get!! In fact that was not the only problem with this room as the bathroom mirror lights were not working, the seal on the shower screen was broken which meant water leaked everywhere when having a shower, the large lamp in the corner did not work, there was noise throughout the night which meant we had barely any sleep, bins were being emptied at 6am on Sunday morning along with building works right up until we checked out by your hotel so to sum up for £351.00 for 1 night it was massively upsetting and disappointing and had in turn spoilt our initial feelings on arrival for something we had saved for our special getaway!!! I called reception from the room to question the fact that the bath was not separate to which Marion just said ‘well some rooms have separate bath and some don’t’! I was disgusted that that was it and no further discussion or service to make it better even though I had clearly expressed my disappointment.

I was also like to mention that the service throughout our stay was below average and very slow. The bar is beautiful and we very much enjoyed our time there for drinks however we had to wait at our table for 20 minutes before even getting a menu for a drink and then when we wanted another one we had to find a waiter to serve us! This is poor and for such a lovely place you need more staff that are there to help or offer drinks when needed. We were there for almost 2 hours and had 2 drinks just from waiting so long.

We then went up for our dinner reservation which was booked for 19:30. There was no one there to greet us and I had to go to reception to ask where to go. We were directed through the restaurant walking past everyone who was eating to get to the service desk. We were shown to our table and given menus. The place is lovely although tables quite close together made it not very private but we were fine and ready to order our food. We both decided to have the angel hair pasta (pesto & vegetables) when the food arrived what we got served was pasta that was luke warm, oily and flavourless with a few practically raw bits of broccoli and beans!! 

We took the wine we had purchased at dinner back to our room and ended up making the most of our night anyway.

All in all we have been left hugely disappointed enough to want to write this to you and express our experience and we feel for something that is far from cheap we have been ripped off!!

I hope that you take the time to read this experience and think about how we as a customer have been made left feeling. 

Thank you for your time

115,Another satisfied customer,"I will add another positive review to the many already posted. We stayed at the Bloomsbury last week whilst dropping off our daughter off for her semester abroad. The location is wonderful, but its the quality of the hotel that impressed us. The staff is  friendly and super helpful. The restaurant is excellent. Our room was small but ultra clean and up to date. The bed is wonderful. Recommend a late drink at the bar downstairs. You can tell their bartenders are pros. ",5,2017,09,27

We remember David, Marina, Nour, Anatolie, and Victor.  Thank you - thank you! ",5,2017,09,24
115,Lovely hotel but service needs improving ,"I read all the reviews for this hotel and the only reason I'm giving this hotel 5 stars is the location! I didn't experience what others have written on here! Firstly, bon arrival I walked up the steps and straight down the corridor missing the very small reception area. No-one was there to greet me or take my bags! When I did find the reception I did not find warm and friendly check in staff. The only one who smiled was the concierge who did an exceptional job in booking 3 lots of theatre tickets for me. As I could not check in at 2pm I went to the terrace cafe for lunch. Despite several empty tables inside(apparently reserved)  I was told I had to sit outside. The service was slow and I felt I had been left outside and forgotten. I asked for still water and was brought a litre bottle of water. I was not asked what size I wanted in the beginning One person only needs a small bottle! Why was I not asked what size bottle did I want to order I felt I had taken advantage of when I received the bill.... £5 for this bottle! So I had finished my meal.... 20min later a girl came to clear my plate...I asked for the bill and she brought it back... after 20 mins waiting for her to come back so I could pay I went to the counter myself to pay. Not good service again! To my dismay I saw both inside tables available when I arrived still not occupied at 3pm. I was left to freeze outside when I could have been sitting inside! 
",5,2017,09,24
115,Wonderful Stay!,"My brother, his family and I stayed at The Bloomsbury for seven nights and were very happy with our stay there. We stayed in one suit and one deluxe room and both were very adequate. The staff were all excellent, from the porters, to the concierge to the reception staff, to the breakfast room staff to the chambermaids!
There is work going on in the hotel, so it can be a bit noisy but it did not really bother us.
The location is fabulous if you want to be in the thick of things. Its extremely accessible by all means of transport.
On the whole we had a very good stay and I would definitely recommend it.
I want to say a big Thank You to all the staff who were very helpful and friendly.",4,2017,09,24

Room rather small and not inexpensive, but nicely appointed with comfortable bedding and attractive bath.",4,2017,09,21

115,Excellent cuisine,Joined family for a lovely evening meal on the terrace.  The food was exceptional as was the service.  The only downside was the time it took to get to the toilets.  It was down in the basement so my advise is to plan your trips to the loo :) ,5,2017,09,18
115,best breakfast I ever had,"We stay for 6 nights in the hotel.We are really enjoy our stay as a whole.Espesially we are stisfied with the breakfast and kindness ,helpfulness and politness of Marina,Maria,
Anatoli,Victor,Ionut.It is really a great pleasure to start your day in such bussy town as London with so nice people.We check out in 5.30a.m and we received packed breakfast and coffee at the reception desk .It was really very kind.",4,2017,09,17
115,Lovely Hotel,"The Bloomsbury is a beautiful, well appointed hotel. The decor, bar, restaurant and rooms are all luxurious feeling with a welcoming atmosphere. The rooms are a reasonable size however the large furniture makes it feel small. The tv needs to be on the wall, large lamps removed and the chair needs to sit under the desk so there is a little more room to move. The bathroom was a great size and the housekeeping service brilliant. Thank you Bloomsbury for our wonderful stay. ",4,2017,09,15
115,Everything about this hotel is great! Food! Location! The rooms! And especially the service!,"The food was excellent. The room could not be nicer. The location was perfect. But the best part was the service. Those working at the Bloomsbury truly act as a team. The care they have for those who stay shines through. I'd like to thank Iohut, Victor, Marina and Maria and all of the others that helped make our stay memorable!",5,2017,09,13
115,Finally - understanding true value of service in center of London,"Great place to stay with excellent service, truely friendly staff and nice rooms with enough space. Good breakfast too.

On top of that, got served by three Dutch interns, already doing excellent while making their way up to top level of hospitality. Thanks for giving my stay just that little extra via being friendly, helpful and enthusiastic!

So, finally found myself a hotel in London I can truly and warmly recommend!",5,2017,09,12
115,Excellent lunch for my best friend's birthday ,"I visited for lunch and had a brilliant time.

The service was fabulous and I especially enjoyed the quality and care that went into the preparation of our cocktails and club sandwiches.

We sat outside on the terrace, which was beautifully presented yet extremely comfortable.

The staff were extremely pleasant and welcoming; to a point that we ended up staying all afternoon.

I am hugely looking forward to returning to this hotel in the future. ",5,2017,09,11
115,Lovely hotel - so kid-friendly!,"We stayed in The Bloomsbury over the summer with our 15-month-old daughter as I was in London on business. The staff couldn't have been kinder to her, especially at breakfast! Nour, Maria, David and Victor spoiled her rotten - chatting and playing with her  and bringing her special little breakfasts and small toys to distract her. We really appreciated their help and the wonderful service. And breakfast was delicious, which was also a plus!

The porters/bellhops were also really helpful, as were any other staff we dealt with. Our room was spotless and comfortable. Didn't get to the bar or restaurant this time, but will definitely try them on the next visit, which is already booked.",5,2017,09,10
115,Excellent hotel!,"Stayed 2 nights as a couple. Highly recommend staying here. Excellent hotel, staff and amenities. Buffet breakfast was great, and they even remember your coffee/tea preferences. They is a little bit of construction going on next door, but this did not affect our stay",5,2017,09,08
115,A wonderful stay - again!,"My wife and I stayed at The Bloomsbury earlier this year, and we were so impressed I decided to rebook when we visited London to celebrate her birthday. We had another wonderful stay, and I reckon it's now become our first choice of accomdation when we visit London.
The staff are all very polite and helpful, and I'd like to give special mentions to Sebastian who excelled with his help in arranging some personal touches, Maria, who managed the breakfasts very efficiently and remembered us from from our previous visit, and Susana on the desk, who was very helpful when we were leaving. Hope to be back soon!",5,2017,09,08
115,Lovely stay,"I had another excellent stay in this hotel. Room was in a quiet area. 
Staff were very helpful. Waiters in dining room were nice, friendly and courteous! 
Hotel location is very central; close to Oxford street, soho and lots of other attractions. Tottenham Court Road tube station is just around the corner. 
I highly recommend this hotel. Will definitely stay there again",5,2017,09,08
115,Wonderful first experience,"I stayed in this Hotel three weeks. Great, Great location. I had standard single room but very spacious. Superb breakfast with wonderful and very professional support by two waiters (Victor and Ionut) well coordinated by the room manager, Maria, very nice and cheerful.",5,2017,09,07
115,Very friendly and helpful,"Thank you so much for being really nice and awake when I arrived at 1.30 in the morning and changing from a great room to a greater for extra people. You missed nothing. It is also one of the few hotels which has properly functioning blow dryers and you don't have to call for an ironing board, which is already there.",5,2017,09,07
115,Wedding night ,"We stayed here on 2nd Sept after our wedding night. The staff were lovely and kindly upgraded our room to a suite and decorated it with flower petals and a chocolate cake. The room was spacious, 2 tv's and a walk in shower!! The hotel itself looks and smells gorgeous and the breakfast was lovely!! Wish we could have stayed longer. Thank you for making our evening that bit more special.",5,2017,09,07
115,Excellent hotel... Except,"We have two stays in this hotel during our trip to UK. 

Just about everything with this hotel is excellent, the location, decor, services, staff especially, beddings, breakfast. 

The first thing need to be looked at is the shower. The shower mixer is fixed too high on the wall, persons below 170 will have a hard time or not be able to reach and adjust it. It is the same with a shower tray or a bath tub. The bath tub is too narrow and even a small size person like myself found it very uneasy and unenjoyable taking a shower. With all the space in the bathroom, it's a choice not carefully thought of. To me, this is an important aspect of a hotel of this class.

In my second stay, we were given a room on 5th floor and every morning at 6ish, we can hear the garbage truck working literally right outside our room as there seems to be a garbage storage or facility right next to hotel, it's a real nuisance and have kept us awake until 7ish. We consider the guests should be informed during reservation and have an option to select perhaps a different room class, even at a higher rate.

The hotel is 5 star at every other aspect, we will highly recommend this hotel, as some may not mind so much the shower part, and if rooms away from the garbage facility can be avoided.",3,2017,09,07
115,Great Staff,"Stayed here as I was on a course, I had a standard single room, although small it had everything you needed and was very clean.
The staff here are fantastic, always smiling, especially Rafael and the breakfast/dinner lot, thank you, after a long day it was so nice to come back to",4,2017,09,06
115,Best hotel in London,"We stayed 3 nights, the hotel is superb, it was under construction, but the attention was amazing. Great location.
Wonderful holiday.
Special thanks. to the director of the night, which I think is called J.C.",5,2017,09,06
115,"Stay at the stunning Bloomsbury Hotel, 16-22 Great Russell st., London","The hotel is beautiful. The staff are courteous and pleasant. The food is delicious and tastefully served. We had a really good time. Thanks to all of the hotel's amazing staff, Who were attentive and sensitive to all our needs above and beyond expectations.",5,2017,09,05
115,Great Location,"We enjoyed a recent 3 night stay at the Bloomsbury planning a weekend around a visit to see The Cursed Child. 

We had a pleasant stay at this hotel and would certainly consider it for a future trip but there were a few points that meant this review didn't quite hit the 5 star rating for us.

The positives:

- Fantastic location, other than taking the tube from Kings Cross the rest of the weekend was spent on foot.
- Staff were very friendly and welcoming
- Beautiful building, some construction work ongoing at present but this didn't impact our stay
- The Dalloway Terrace is a great addition especially for breakfast (see separate review for the restaurant) better than the price quoted by the hotel of their breakfast. 

The negatives
- One Lift out of action for part of the stay which was frustrating and meant a longer than normal wait each time
- Room Cleaning was sporadic examples included: only one clean towel left, meaning we needed to get a additional one late in the evening when we returned. Dirty Glasses left and no replacement.
- The room layout felt cluttered, I fully appreciate the small room size of London hotels. Kettle / Tea Tray was not located near a socket, table blocking door to wardrobe

I know the negatives seem fussy but these are the kind of things that have to be right in boutique chains.

As a whole, I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone based on location alone. I just think a couple of areas need a little attention to push it to the next level.",4,2017,09,04
115,Best hotel in London ,"Having wanting to stay here for many years I finally got to and wasn't disappointed! By far the best hotel I have stayed in within London. The staff are so helpful and friendly. A rarity feeling like every single person who worked there was making the extra effort. From the bags being collected from us and carried before we had got near the front door to the extremely helpful receptionists helping us find our way around the tube. We stayed in a suite so have zero complaints about the room. Spacious, very clean. Everything we possibly needed was in the room for our stay. The cocktail bar is excellent also. After a trip out for food we returned for a few drinks and sitting outside on the little benches with pillows was wonderful. Breakfast was also excellent. Wide choice of hot and cold food, great service. 
There was not one part of our stay here that I can fault. Everything was perfect and we both can't wait to return again in the future. ",5,2017,09,04
115,Lovely hotel!,"This is a lovely 5* hotel, ideally located close to Oxford street. Although I happened to arrive and stay during some soft renovation works, I wasn't bothered at all. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Reasonable prices, very clean rooms, extremely comfortable mattress and good quality amenities. Look forward to my next visit there.",5,2017,09,01
115,"A lovely, welcoming hotel in the heart of London","After staying in numerous hotels over the previous three months, The Bloomsbury really stood out for the warm welcome offered by the friendly efficient staff, and for the elegance and comfort of the room - such as the good quality hot chocolate provided on the tea tray. But it really won my approval for the wonderful staff at breakfast. Not only was breakfast delicious, but Maria, Marina and Ionut, ably supported by Anatoli, Nour, Victor and David, made mornings something to look forward to. It also helps that theatres, restaurants and shopping are within walking distance. The Bloomsbury is now my preferred place to stay whenever I'm in London.",5,2017,08,31
115,My go-to stay in London,"I travel to London twice a year for work and I always stay at the Bloomsbury.  The hotel is gorgeous, that staff is incredible and location is great!  Close to Covent Garden and some of the most amazing restaurants!  If I ever get the chance to come back just for fun, I will still be staying at the Bloomsbury!",5,2017,08,30
115,Near perfect hotel,"Great location, wonderful service, extremely comfortable rooms, and a fantastic bar downstairs for a cocktail.  We stayed 3 nights and didn't want to leave.  It's a beautiful, classic hotel in an ideal location with easy access to Theatreland, Soho, British Museum and tons of public transport.",5,2017,08,29
115,Not just the little things,"The team at the Bloomsbury are great.  Attention to customer service and a real feeling that they cared about us as guests.  It's not just the little things they did which were delightful surprises that made our stay there so impressively good, it's everything!",5,2017,08,29
115,Must Stay...!,"Now one of my favorite hotels, the room was great the hotel was quite. 

The bar downstairs was great and Charlotte the bartender gave the best advise of what to see and do.

Can't wait to stay here again.",5,2017,08,28
115,Excellent base from which to explore London,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel on 2 separate occasions in early August (attending World Athletics Championships). It is ideally placed for the underground - 2 minutes walk - on the Central Line, which makes for easy travel around London. The rooms are not huge, but are spotlessly clean and the beds are very comfortable. The staff were excellent, friendly and helpful, from the porters and the staff on the check-in desk (sorry, didn't get your names), to those who served us a marvellous breakfast every day of our stay. A big thank you to Maria and the team, Ionut, Nour and Marina, for the prompt attentive service we received, it was much appreciated. I have no hesitation in recommending The Bloomsbury. Now we have discovered it we will undoubtedly return.",5,2017,08,28
115,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed 1 night at the Bloomsbury at the beginning of August and we loved it. The staff are ever so helpful and welcoming. The hotel is beautiful. It is also very well located, only a few minutes walk from the British Museum, the Tube station or lovely eateries...
The bar at the basement is exquisite: do not miss it! We spent a relaxing evening there.
Breakfast is great: a lot of variety and plentiful.
The room was well equipped, the bed was extremely comfortable, and there was no issue setting up an extra bed for our 10 year old son.

All in all a really relaxing and agreeable stay in London.
We are travelling back to London during the next school break and will go back to the  Bloomsbury without any hesitation.",5,2017,08,27
115,2ND TIME AT THE GREAT HOTEL-NOT DISAPPOINTED,A return trip to this central London hotel and the whole experience was even better than I remembered.  Can not praise all the staff enough - they all go out of their way to make you feel welcome and comfortable.  Beautiful comfortable surroundings and an excellent breakfast.  Hard to beat.,5,2017,08,25
115,brilliant stay,"Rooms amazing, the staff made you feel very welcome and  went out of their way to make sure you'd want for nothing making my stay that extra special - not something you'd get in many hotels through out the UK.",5,2017,08,24
115,Lovely well located hotel with wonderful staff,"Located in Bloomsbury, near Tottenham Court Road, the Bloomsbury is close to many London attractions. We had two stays, one of five nights and one of three. For the longer we had a larger room, but both times our room was a lovely, quiet haven to return to after a day's outing at galleries and museums, meeting friends, or a night at the theatre or a concert. The concierge staff were very helpful both prior to our arrival and during our visit, helping us obtain tickets and transport. While there was a lot of renovation work going on in the public areas of the hotel, the staff endeavoured to minimise the impact. The breakfasts are delicious and really set you up for the day. A special shoutout to Nour, Ionut, Victor and Maria. Also a big thank you to the check in staff who, on our arrival after a 24 hour flight from Australia enabled an early check in, and a late check out prior to a late flight out of Heathrow. These things really make a difference. We hope we shall be able to stay again in the near future.",5,2017,08,23
115,THOROUGHLY AMAZING,"I have had the most amazing stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel, Part of the Doyle collection.  The staff were friendly and greeted us like old friends which I thought  really set the scene for our whole break. our room was lovely and the addition of the personalised fruit basket made us feel really special.  We ate in the Dalloway Terrace Restaurant.  The staff were more than knowledgeable about the menu and which wine would be best suited to our meal, it was so romantic sat amongst the flowering trees and the added touch of the blankets if it turned cold, just goes to prove how thoughtful hotel this is.  The food was superb.   Thank you again the staff at the Bloomsbury.",5,2017,08,23
115,Tea with mums,"Bloombury hotel has lovely friendly staff that make your afternoon tea a very pleasant experience.
I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere of sitting on the floral sofa and having teas served, it felt like home. 
The tea was a treat to our moms, my friend and I both there with our mothers. As my friend and her mom very very late getting there we had some drinks before hand. It was a memorable tea, the cakes and sandwiches were all very light, delicate and delicious, but also filling, the three tiers of cake, scone and sandwiches brought to you on in a long stand was a good idea, the tables are small so it helps having the stand on the side. Also there is a good array of teas.",4,2017,08,22
115,Anniversary night away,"Unfortunately, there was building work going on at the Bloomsbury that we were unaware of.
We went to our room to be greeted by a Sainsburys trolley full of paint tins and paint trays!
Could not get through to reception so went back down five floors and reception were very apologetic and quick to change our room and able to give us a slight upgrade. We also received a complimentary bottle of champagne which was a nice touch.
Breakfast was lovely.",3,2017,08,21
115,London,"Just off Tottenham Court Road but in a quiet side road. Handy for Theatres, British Museum, CharlesDickens areas, Inns of Court and Covent Garden. Comfy quiet room. The breakfast was excellent. Dalloway Terrace for evening meal very nice but booking essential. ",4,2017,08,20
115,Wonderful hotel!,"This hotel is beautiful and makes quite an impression from the moment you walk in.  The staff makes you a priority and I loved the chic décor throughout, especially the rooms and the gorgeous terrace. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were spacious and well equipped with robes, hair dryer (not attached to the wall), laundry, mini bar, coffee maker and an excellent Wi-Fi connection. A nice added touch to my stay was finding an exotic fruit bouquet and card at my night stand when I arrived back for the evening. The location of this hotel can’t be beat, just steps away from the British Museum, Covent Garden, Theater District, shopping, restaurants and much more! A few restaurants I found close by are Dishroom, Randall & Aubin, Rock & Sole Plaice and Homeslice, all excellent.  I’ll definitely return on my next visit to London!",5,2017,08,20
115,Perfect Hotel,"What a fantastic hotel. Perfect location, great staff and wonderful food.

Every member of staff that we encountered during our two night stay were fab. They were exceptionally polite and a credit to the hotel. Service beyond expectations.

Our room was small but perfectly formed and exactly as described on the booking site. Can't fault it.

Breakfast was again served with a smile. Freshly squeezed orange juice, tea and coffee in abundance. The cooked offering perfectly presented and equally as delicious.

Well recommended, excellent value and we will return. 

",5,2017,08,20
115,Yet again another super stay,We went back as a family group to celebrate my Mums birthday and yet again have had a super time. A great location for shopping for the girls and to go sightseeing for my Dad and the grandchildren! Very easy from the tube and we always love walking to Covent Garden. The staff are always friendly and very helpful. We are now looking forward to returning soon with the new entrance. Thank you for another super stay.,5,2017,08,19
115,Lovely stay,"Spent 4 nights here and had a wonderful time.
Location was excellent: just a few minutes from the tube station and Oxford street for some serious shopping.
Dined at the Dalloway terrace which was pretty decent.
Room was a bit on the smaller side but understandable as this was in London.
Room facilities were modern and more than adequate. 
But I found the service the best of all. Very personalised and we were greeted by our names.
A special shoutout to Bryan for making our stay more memorable by getting our tickets to watch Arsenal played.",4,2017,08,18
115,Favourite London Hotel,"I travel extensively around the world and come to London often. The Bloomsbury easily rates as my favourite London hotel. From the rooms to the little underground bar it has real character and uniqueness. The breakfasts are superb and Maria is fantastic - she always remembers my order. Her team of Ionut, Marina, Victor and Nour are always efficient, friendly and greet with a smile. Highly recommended whether on business or pleasure as links to Oxford Street and West End outstanding ",5,2017,08,17
115,Simply the Best!,"If you are looking for a top hotel then the Bloomsbury is it. Yes it is in the higher end of the budget, but well worth the expense as a treat or for a special occasion/getaway.
The minute you enter the lovely new Reception you are the staffs' no 1 priority, and are treated with great professionalism as well as a good sense of humour!
We had booked a Queen room with breakfast and were given a free upgrade to a King room, which was very peaceful looking out onto the inner courtyard of the hotel. Spacious, comfortable, well ventilated in the London Summer heat, with a well stocked mini bar, robes & slippers, and decent sized bathroom with separate walk in shower and bath, we totally relaxed the moment we arrived!
In our opinion every member of staff deserves a mention but particularly the breakfast room staff - 
Maria-Manna, Nour-Inout-Victor, nothing was too much trouble each morning and they also had time for a friendly chat even though they were always very busy. Thank you all.
A must do while you are staying at the Bloomsbury is to visit the BC bar/outdoors bar for a few drinks and snacks or just for a nightcap, inside is like travelling back in time and outside is like stepping into fairyland, I won't give any more details, you have to see it for yourself 😊 Also, the Dalloway Terrace is a must for breakfast al fresco and afternoon tea.
There is construction work going on upstairs to convert the old lobby/reception into a grand bar, we will definitely be making a return visit when this is complete!
The location of the hotel in the Bloomsbury area of London is perfect for safety, access to shopping, public transport, Shaftesbury Avenue for theatre land, Soho for great restaurants & nightlife, and also closeness to the British Museum too.
We would highly recommend a stay at the Bloomsbury, which is in our opinion, the only hotel for us when we return again to visit London in the future.
",5,2017,08,16

",5,2017,08,13
115,Wonderful week at the Bloomsbury,"Excellent location, very convenient to eat, shop and sightseeing. Very good service. Bathroom was a little small, amenities were fine. Hotel was under renovations during stay, no bother. The tv reception was not vey good. Would stay here again because of location and service, but maybe look for a less expensive hotel around that same area. Asked for them to make some room in mini bar to store personal items, they provided me an entire new one. Also, got a complimentary anniversary desert and wine bottle.",5,2017,08,12
115,"Great location, good amenities, nice staff","Really liked being hosted at this hotel, totally would indicate it. Thanks in special to the night manager Joao Carlos whom made us fell like home and helped us on choose the niceties tourism points. =D",5,2017,08,11
115,Birthday treat,"Stayed overnight for my partner's birthday. Staff extremely helpful, always available and provided birthday card and cake in the room. Terrace was lovely for a drink. Excellent hotel and will definitely return.",5,2017,08,11
115,Very Good,"Great Location,easy access to transport and very comfortable hotel. The staff are extremely helpful and very polite. The standards room are small but quite adequate.Breakfast was great with everything you could want, would definitely stay again.",4,2017,08,10
115,"Wonderful, Personable Staff and a Great Setting","A great setting and atmosphere, love the new lay-out and excited to see the end result. All staff are attentive and go the extra mile to make it a second home. Joel and Eljesa were super in the bar/restaurant and make our stay a great experience",5,2017,08,10
115,Beautiful hotel with wonderful staff,"Would highly recommend this hotel.  Excellent standards throughout, all staff were very friendly and attentive - nothing was too much trouble.  They went out of their way to ensure that I had the best birthday ever! Hotel is just beautiful and in a good location.  We will definitely be returning.  Thank you.",5,2017,08,09
115,Lovely hotel,"Second stay here and planning a third for our next stay in a few weeks time. Think that says a lot. It's in a super central location yet still quiet and peaceful. Room spotless and very comfortable. Staff are a credit, very helpful. Excellent breakfast with good choice from the buffet plus freshly prepared if you wish and really lovely staff on duty the morning we were there with endless good hot coffee. Very impressed.",5,2017,08,08
115,Lovely night away,"As we were arriving in London early morning I had contacted the hotel before to ask if they would store my luggage.  Quick response back and no problem at all.
On our arrival early in the morning they sorted out our luggage and said that we could check in early if we wished to.
Lovely staff, friendly, happy and polite.  
Our room was on the fourth floor facing the theatre next door and overlooking the hotel restaurant.  However double glazing and both blinds and blackout curtains were provided if we needed it.  
The room had air con which kept the room a perfect chilly temperature for us.  Easy to use if you don't like a cooler room.
Nespresso coffee machine for fresh coffee, kettle, selection of teas, coffee & hot chocolate.  Robes and slippers, umbrella (English weather) drawers and plenty of hangers.  Also a mini bar and safe. 
Bathroom was big enough with a dual shower, bath etc.  All the toiletries you might need and plenty of hot water.
Husband and I both agreed that the bed was incredibly comfortable.
Having worked in hotels and knowing what to look for this was one of the best I've stayed in.",5,2017,08,07
115,A must to go hotel when in London,"I had an amazing stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel. The hotel is beautiful, has a conveniente location and I had the greatest pleasure to have met JC Vergueiro that helped me with all the great tips in the city. 
It's definitely a must to go back for me.",5,2017,08,07
115,"outstanding cleanliness,great location","the manger MR.ZAIN and the concierge employee were very helpful in my stay ,they have kept for me the luggage in storage until I com back from Edinburgh,
they are ready to help without hesitation and with smile.",4,2017,08,06
115,Loved the hotel,"Extremely helpful staff, beautiful room.  I have balance issues so the hotel upgraded my room to handicap at no charge to make sure I was safe using the bath.   Beautiful neighborhood only 1 block from British Museum and Hop-off-hop on bus location.  Very safe.  Many restaurants very close by.",5,2017,08,05
115,"Great staff, convenient location, well maintained","We had a very enjoyable stay for a reasonable price (for London in July). The hotel has impressive and beautiful public spaces beginning with the entrance. Our room was equally nice - small (of course) but clean, with a well-appointed bathroom. Every staff member we interacted with was pleasant and helpful but I have to give special praise to the staff of the downstairs bar. (Go downstairs and have them make you a complicated cocktail: you won't be disappointed.) I personally don't like the neighborhood - being close to the British Museum is nice if you're going there, and there is a Tube stop just around the corner, but the crowds and filth of Oxford St are equally close. But if you like this location you cannot do better than to stay at the Bloomsbury.",5,2017,08,04
115,What an amazing hotel in the centre of London ,"This hotel is beautiful with beautiful staff. All staff are attentive from the moment you arrive. The hotel is based very central so easy to get from the tube on the central line and easy walking distance to Oxford Street. The rooms have everything you could possibly need. The breakfast was absolutely amazing so I suggest you book with breakfast. 
We will definitely return here when ever we stay in London on our visits from Australia and will recommend to anyone to stay at. 
Big thank you to all the staff who made our stay amazing. ",5,2017,08,04
115,Lovely Breakfast,"I called in to the Bloomsbury for a la carte breakfast, after travelling in from Wales to visit the British Museum. 
The horel is a little confusing initially, since breakfast is downstairs and in a smallish dark room, with no windows. They are refurbishing at the moment so drilling, banging and sanding were part of the entertainment. 
This was all lost in the warm smiles and kind helpful ehaviour of the staff, from the moment I walked through the door, until I left. 
The seating was very comfortable, and I was able to order breakfast at my pace. 
Breakfast was lovely. Delicious freshly baked homemade bread. Yogurts, compot, honey and fresh orange juice to start with, followed by full cooked English breakfast, with the tastiest bacon I have ever had, and perfect fried eggs. Absolutely lovely. Tea with the meal, and coffee to finish. Plus a complementary newspaper. Wonderful. 
The waiter who mainly helped me was Nour. He was great. Really listened to my wish to take time noting the meal, didn't hurry me, and gave me a warm personal welcome, despite my not being a hotel guest. All the other staff were also helpful. 
Well done The Bloomsbury.",5,2017,08,04
115,perfect,"a wonderful hotel, very near the British Museum and only two steps away from Oxford Street, Covent Garden, ... Nice decorated rooms with good bedding and bathroom with bath and showers and all amenities. We had quiet rooms on the 3rd floor. Breakfast is buffet style but you can order eggs, pancakes, full britsh breakfast, smoothies, ... Beautiful lobby where we had perfect Afternoon tea. Friendly helpful staff. A place to go back to.",5,2017,08,01
115,Amazing hotel,"Visited for the weekend, the hotel was amazing once again, staff - exceptional service, great ""can-do"" attitude. There have been a number of changes since our last visit, all improving further the experience. The great location will never change, it's so convenient for all our needs. This was our first time visiting with children and they were blown away with the quality and level of service. We will definitely return and couldn't recommend it more highly to anyone looking at staying in central London.",5,2017,08,01
115,Always excellent - thank you!,"I stay at this hotel when in London and am always very pleased - the rooms are top quality, the staff are simply excellent and breakfast is also always a pleasure. Location is excellent - very central but still in a quiet and calm area.",5,2017,08,01
115,Phenomenal all the time!,"Ive stayed at many London hotels on business but the Bloomsbury is head and shoulder above the the rest and always delivers. 
The staff always ensure a stay that ecompasses luxury, relaxation and a feeling of home from home. The breakfasts are alway top class and I must make special mention of Maria who always remembers my name, my order and my preferred table.
Recommendation without hesitation!",5,2017,07,31
115,Charming well-equipped Hotel with variable service but shame about the noisy refurbishment outside main conference room,"I attended a business conference at this hotel for 3 consecutive days (Friday to Sunday) mid July 2017 and at first glance, was pleasantly surprised. I initially went to a hotel around the corner Hotel Mercure London Bloomsbury by error and The Bloomsbury Hotel is much nicer.
I did get great help at reception when the printer in their business centre made available for customers kept jamming and once I emailed them my reservation and tickets, they kindly print them up for me free of charge.
Nevertheless I ordered one of their healthy smoothy early morning for a quick breakfast prior the start of the second day of conference and it still was not ready 20 minutes later when I had to do without.
Also the Hotel was doing some renovation on the ground floor straight outside the Main Conference room where we were located and we had to suffer long and very noisy episodes of grinding and drilling which made it hard to hear and listen to the presenters on the first two days.
I chose to stay at a local friend's home so only saw the Ladies powder room which was clean and well-stocked with toiletries, toilet paper and towels.
I hope future conferences won't have the nuisance of the handy men's tool background noise to deal with and that the bar will be offering the smoothies shortly after they have been ordered.",4,2017,07,31
115,Another fantastic stay ,Yet again another fantastic stay at this great boutique hotel my sister and brother in law were over from Australia so treated them to stay here they loved it we also took them to the bar and had a night of cocktails feels like our second home all the staff are very helpful and freindly the breakfast was also lovely lots to choose from as well our stay was even more relaxed thanks to Sebastian Annandale we are back in November for the weekend and looking forward to seeing the finished building work as well which will make this boutique hotel even nicer 😊,5,2017,07,30
115,Terrible showers!,"I have stayed at this hotel a lot. It's location is good for the West End and as I tend to stay in town on my own, it's ideal. 

However, there is a distinct air of complacency about the place.  I don't find the staff particularly friendly, especially those on the Dalloway Terrace where, despite being a resident and giving as much notice as feasible, is almost impossible to get a table, even just for a drink. I have stood surrounded by empty tables and been told no, sorry, not a chance. It is possible to have a drink in the lobby area but that's a bit soulless and the bar downstair is so dark, and the service not particularly good. I've sat in there before for nearly 15 minutes before being asked if I needed anything. 

But my main bug bear about this place is the showers.  The rooms are very nice, the beds very comfortable, but the showers are ridiculous.  Weak with zero water pressure, it got to the point on my most recent visit where I didn't bother.

I did mention it to the receptionist on checking out but it was greeted with the usual disinterest.  

Doubt I'll stay again.",3,2017,07,30
115,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"Fantastic boutique hotel. Updated rooms, bathrooms and amenities including a workout facility along with plenty of historical charm. Appreciated the helpful staff. Quiet retreat from the city. Try the afternoon tea there! Wonderful stay.",5,2017,07,29
115,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff","My husband and I really enjoyed our stay here at the start of our honeymoon. The Bloomsbury is a beautiful, historic-looking brick building (although it doesn't have your typical driveway, and you do have to go up a couple of stairs to go in) — and it's only a couple of blocks from an Underground station, so you can easily get anywhere in town from here. It's also walkable to all the great little bars and restaurants in SoHo. We walked in with out backpacking backpacks and in our travel clothes, straight from the airport, and they were incredibly friendly. We even got a little welcome plate of fruit and 2 glasses of sparkling since it was our honeymoon. The staff brought up our bags and explained anything we need to know about the room, which was small, but otherwise really nice. The only thing is that there's not much of views and there was a lot of construction in the area starting around 8 or 9am that would force us to get up. I know it's not their fault, but it was somewhat unpleasant.",5,2017,07,26
115,Recommended Hotel both for business or pleasure,"Wonderful location,clean rooms ,friendly staff
the hotel is located 3 minutes walk from oxford street and tottenham tube station.
offers good breakfast and an amazing service
i would sure go back to the hotel in my next visit.
",4,2017,07,26
115,"Great location, comfortable, luxurious, but beware construction!","This review would be raving if not for the ear splitting construction and drilling of concrete  going on starting at 8am every day of our stay. It vibrated everything in the room and lasted over 8 hours. Every day. It really detracted from our stay and prevented us from catching up on sleep from jetlag which in turn greatly impacted our entire European trip. I know construction has to happen at times but the level of noise and long hours of it and inability of any part of the hotel to escape the noise (we were several floors above it and still vibrated things in our room and was deafening) made this a less than desirable experience for us. 

The hotel staff, rooms, food, gym, and overall quality was luxurious and amazing. Comfortable, good water pressure and nice bathroom, really enjoyed the gym and restaurant and front desk staff were very helpful and polite. If not for the construction this would have been an absolute delight. We hope to be back to London soon but I would be afraid to book here again without definite reassurance of no construction.",5,2017,07,23
115,inconsistent experience,"i was attending a conference this week, arrived with luggage and carried it up the stairs
i was greeted with a lovely smile from a lady who asked if she could help with my bag, yes that is great.  when i asked if i could leave the bag with the concierge she was told that i would have to take my bag with me and as the lift was broken i would have to carry it down the stairs - no help here !!!!  Not impressed......
the room and chairs were comfortable and there was a nice bar area - inside and out
I was meeting a friend for a drink, so headed to the bar, only to be told it would not be service till 6pm (45 minutes away) I did not mind waiting as I did not want to lug my bag around any more, but 'computer said no' and i had to walk up the stairs again and wait in the lobby
would seem there is a bit of work to be done around taking care of their customers!!!",3,2017,07,23
115,Wonderful,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Bloomsbury.  It was central to everything I wanted to see and so enjoyed spending time just relaxing on the terrace with a newspaper and wonderful breakfast.  The staff were so accommodating and made me feel relaxed and enjoy my time spent in London.,5,2017,07,21
115,Nice Hotel!!,"My husband and I stayed at the Bloomsbury hotel for eight nights in the end of May. 
It was our first visit to London.
 The hotel's location is great and very convenient, it's easy to get Tube station, British Museum, Soho and central London form there. We love this hotel, our room was very small but clean, quiet and the bed was very comfortable.
 The hotel’s employees were very kind, friendly and helpful. We are very Thankful to Estelita, Justin and the whole team in the club's dining room. we could order green salad every day (it's our habit to eat it every day).  So, during our stay we could maintain eating a healthy and delicious breakfast which we enjoyed a lot.
 We very much enjoyed our stay, and appreciate the Hotel's employees for their great help.
Thank you!
we will come back again!  
",4,2017,07,20
115,Afternoon tea delight,"Really enjoyed afternoon tea in The Bloomsbury. There was no problem in moving our pre-booked table away from the air conditioning. Service was friendly with the right amount of attention. There were tasty sandwiches, excellent scones with the right amount of jam and cream and too many delicious cakes to eat! (These were boxed up for us to take away). Happy to recommend this hotel.",4,2017,07,20
115,anniversary,"great location for the opera and national gallery, 
bar was a lovely setting great atmosphere 
room air conditioning was brilliant 
very comfortable beds did not want to get up
had a wonderful anniversary",4,2017,07,17
115,Weekend stay,"We recently stayed at The Bloomsbury for the weekend,  the staff were very friendly and made us feel welcome. This is our second stay here and would highly recommend it to anyone.  Location is good for theatres and tube stations.   If you require a nice English breakfast away from the hotel, try Eve's sandwich bar opposite, excellent service and food",5,2017,07,17
115,Elegant and Charming,"My wife and I visited The Bloomsbury on a recent trip the London's west end for a theatre show. The hotel is in an excellent location near to Tottenham Court Road for west end theatres, restaurants and shopping. The elegant dark wood interior is charming and the staff are courteous and attentive. The seated area in the lobby provides a small bar for drinks and afternoon teas to guests and visitors alike. Delightful, worth a visit.",4,2017,07,17
115,A lovely hotel in a very handy area for the West End and Hyde Park,"We visited London last weekend for the theatre and the Tom Petty concert so wanted a hotel we could walk to for both. The room was small but well appointed. The furniture was dark but well maintained and tidy. The bed was also very comfortable. The bathroom was a bit small and the shower door hit the basin when you opened it. Biggest criticism was they only had one lift working for the whole hotel. This caused lengthy waits in the morning, which as we were on the 6th floor we had to use.",4,2017,07,15
115,Visiting London,You can't go wrong with the Bloomsbury. Excellent location and excellent facilities. Friendly staff make the hotel a great place to stay and the general atmosphere is fantastic. A great experience !!!,5,2017,07,13
115,"The Bloomsbury - a little gem, quiet yet centrally located","We recently spent 4 nights at this charming hotel that is near the action, the British Museum, theaters etc., and yet offers the weary traveler an escape from the noise and London's hustle and bustle. 
I would describe the hotel as possessing understated charm. Nice lobby where picture perfect afternoon tea is served. We enjoyed the inside + outside restaurant and the very adequate breakfast which was included with our room.
We asked for a very quiet room, knowing that London streets can be very noisy. Our 4th floor room faced a small courtyard so there was no view but not a sound from outside. The room itself was nicely appointed but requires a word of caution - the room is small with hardly a drawer but there was an adequate cupboard to hang your clothes. We travel with hand-luggage so we managed but someone with several suitcases would have nowhere to unpack his/her things.
Finally the bathroom: It was in good condition but small and surely no room for 2.
Conclusion: we liked the hotel and would go back but we would pay extra for a larger room and bathroom if available.",4,2017,07,10
115,Returned to the Bloomsbury and again very well located and helpful.,"Very good location for theatre, dining and shopping. Staff are always obliging and helpful. Rooms a little on the small side especially bathrooms but not untypical of the area in this. Good breakfasts though choice on Sundays not matched by rest of week. Quick and efficient laundry service. Steps at front need negotiating but notice bell to call for help. Not a great street for hailing taxis - better to walk to Tottenham Court Road.",5,2017,07,10
115,Great location & comfortable stay,"I had a two night stay in The Bloomsbury for a business trip. The hotel is located very central which makes it easily accessible from tube stations. It is quite modern and very well kept in all public areas. The staff were extremely friendly, both reception, breakfast and conference staff made sure that I had everything I needed. The rooms however were very small, which was fine for me as I was travelling alone and only stayed for two nights, however I would imagine if you had a longer stay it may start to feel claustrophobic. The conference rooms are great and different to all the standard meeting rooms you see around London. The food was excellent, very tasty and well presented. Would definitely return for short stay in London.",4,2017,07,10
115,Clean and comfortable but beware the promotional bedroom pics,"Lovely building in a great central location and some beautiful architectural features. Reception staff very helpful. We booked a superior double room about six months ago but our room, while clean and comfortable, was more a standard room size with a standard width bed with one easy chair shoehorned into a corner. Nothing like the photo on the website. There was a very large wedding at the hotel during our stay last night, so maybe the wedding party had bagged all the best rooms. We were on the inside of the building above the function room too, so the music from the party was quite loud until the party was over. However, the bed was comfy and the air conditioning works well, so sleeping wasn't too badly affected. One pack of badly broken biscuits provided for the morning cuppa. So, I can only give it three stars given the niggles about room spec for the cost, having been drawn in by the prospect of more space to move around.",3,2017,07,09
115,Lovely hotel though our room was not the best,"We were give a room on the top floor overlooking an inner courtyard so room was pretty dark, small with low ceilings. We asked for another room but nothing else was available, location great with good access to theatres, museum etc. would have a been a better review if the room allocated was better.",4,2017,07,06
115,"4 Words: Elegant, Classic, Clean, and Modern","I spent 8 nights staying at The Bloomsbury Hotel.  Aside from the excellent location in London, the hotel was beautifully appointed and the service was outstanding.  The beds were first class and comfortable, the air conditioning was perfect.  If you are looking for a hotel that has classic style and service with a modern sensibility, stay here.  The hotel was undergoing some construction (forgivable and temporary) so there was too much noise to enjoy a brunch in the Dalloway Terrace, but restaurant offered an outstanding breakfast (order the Avocado Toast for a light and healthy).  Also, the price seemed very reasonable for the level of comfort and service the hotel offers.  I will absolutely stay here again when I return to London.   Thank you Bloomsbury, may stay was wonderful.  ",5,2017,07,04
115,Great Location and Excellent Stay,"We spent 3 nights at The Bloomsbury and it was the perfect place to end our trip to the UK.  When we arrived at our room we were greeted with chocolate covered strawberries and a hand written note wishing us a happy anniversary!  Later in the evening when we returned from dinner we found rose petals and and candles throughout our room/bathroom!  Many thanks to Camille for the thoughtful and personal touch.  Our large corner king suite was clean, comfortable, well appointed and had more than enough room for us to spread out/relax after our days of sightseeing.  The location cannot get any better - close enough to walk to all attractions in London or you can use the tube stations that are close by.  We found the location to be very quiet for such a busy area.   All staff we encountered were very friendly and professional.  We had breakfast each morning and there was a variety of offerings to choose from.  The first morning the service was excellent.  Unfortunately the second morning was a different story.  The wrong coffee was brought to our table and we had to hunt someone down to take our cooked breakfast order.  When you're paying a premium for breakfast this should not happen.  Overall this is an excellent hotel and would definitely return if I am fortunate enough to visit London again.",5,2017,07,04
115,Great start bad ending,"Visited for a two night stay, great location. Rooms were very nice and breakfast was outstanding. It's quite a small hotel. Only negative for me personally is that we wanted to use the bar on our last night and were refused entry due to a private function. I feel as a paying customer you should have access to all amenities specified and some prior notification about the bar being closed to paying hotel customers should have been given. ",4,2017,07,02
115,Great location in the heart of London,"The Bloomsbury is exactly what you'd expect in a proper London hotel. The rooms are comfortable and modern, yet the place still has an Edwardian elegance about it.  Everyone we encountered was friendly and extremely helpful. 

If you're in the bar when Sebastian is on duty you're in for a real treat, he is a true artist when mixing cocktails.  The Colonial G&T was one of my favorites, but we were also blown away by his rendition of a Long Island Iced Tea, one of our family favorites.  We had a lot of fun with the staff while we were there, they definitely made our stay a memorable experience.  Caroline gave us some great sightseeing tips, and my sons and I had quite a few laughs with everyone working in the bar over the course of our stay. 

In the morning we had breakfast with Maria running the show.  After our first day she had our preferences down cold and greeted us each morning as if we were regulars that had been coming there for years.  

I have been to many hotels over the years, but this is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review.  The Bloomsbury really added a fantastic dimension to our stay in London and my only regret is that I didn't book a few more days there.",5,2017,07,02
115,Couldn't fault anything ,"My family and I have just enjoyed 4 nights at this establishment. We could not even start to say a negative word about any part of our stay. The entire staff were most friendly, polite, courteous, remembered who we were and simply could not have made our stay any better. In fact they serviced our needs better than any other one time I can ever recall. Well done team, you made our 4 day stay in London, straight from Melbourne, Australia with 3 young kids most pleasurable. Can't recommend this more highly and would come back here in a heart beat. Top marks and thank you ",5,2017,07,01
115,Good and solid Hotel,"The location is absolutely great and all-in-all a good place with good service. The rooms or at least the one I had was a little small and windows to the interior court. It was very adequate and good enough for one night.
",4,2017,06,30
115,Upscale but dark rooms,"Located near to the British Museum, and easy to get to anywhere in central London from this hotel. 

This is an upscale hotel.  The lobby is hugely impressive.  The staff are very friendly.  

The rooms are a reasonable size though not large and the beds are particularly comfortable with toppers etc...but the decor is modern but dark/dim/a little on the depressing side.  I didn't want vibrant colours or anything wacky but the choices of greys/browns/beiges was a little gloomy.  

Breakfast was fine but expensive and there are good cheap options within 100 yards of the hotel.  

Would I stay again?  if there was a deal on yes.  If you are wealthy and money is no object this would be a good choice of hotel.  But for most this would represent an expensive option.   Good for a treat for a special occasion.  ",4,2017,06,29
115,Superb!,"This hotel is an absolute gem! Perfectly located for exploring central London, with easy access to tube stations and buses, too. 

My partner and I spent three night here, and it was the perfect stay. Our room was beautifully appointed, very comfortable and exceptionally clean. The small details made it all the better; the lovely bath products, daily newspapers delivered to our door, the turndown service and nespresso machine were touches that clearly demonstrate a hotel of quality.

The hotel staff members were so friendly and approachable - sometimes in hotels such as these staff can be aloof and inaccessible, yet here we were welcomed warmly.

We'll be back to London again soon, and The Bloomsbury will once more be our hotel of choice!",5,2017,06,27
115,Great location and friendly staff,"Bloomsbury is between Tottenham Court Rd and the British Museum--you can walk to all the central places. Breakfast is generous and pleasantly served. The concierge staff, Ivan and Pavel, are helpful, and Ioton a friendly face at breakfast. Calloway terrace pleasant, too, but some renovations going on at ground level.",5,2017,06,27
115,Very comfortable,"I was very pleased with my stay. Friendly welcome, attentive service. Very comfortable bed. Nothing too ambitious in terms of decor. My main piece of advice is to avoid breakfast in the subterranean, noisy breakfast room. Good buffet but the space is unattractive and the piped music annoying.",4,2017,06,26
115,Beautiful Hotel with Tremendous Service,"My husband, mother and I share a studio suite for 5 nights and had a wonderful time.  The primary and roll away beds were comfortable.  The service provided by Brian and Ivan-concierge, Justin-reception and Estelita and her team in the Club Dining room for breakfast were all top notch.  We all felt very comfortable and were were made to feel comfortable by the entire staff. ",5,2017,06,25
115,Their assistance for a guest in a wheelchair was appalling,"The hotel has a flight of steps at the front so we followed the signs for the disabled entrance.  This was a door at the side with a bell to ring to summon a lift. The access to the door was firstly blocked by 2 parked cars and then by decorative bicycles which are used to advertise the hotel's bar.  Having managed to manoeuvre the wheelchair through to the door with great difficulty, we rang the bell but there was no response.  Eventually one of the party had to walk to the front entrance and go to reception.  The staff said they couldn't hear the door bell from there.  This sequence of events occurred throughout the stay - even though they knew there was someone needing to use this access door.  This is very poor customer service and we would not ever use this hotel again.",2,2017,06,25
115,Fabulous hotel! We will return ,"We recently stayed at The Bloomsbury hotel for 2 nights in May to visit the Chelsea Flower Show. We really wanted a luxury hotel in London that wasn't going to completely break the bank but didn't know where to stay. We loved staying at The Westbury in Dublin last year - also a Doyle Collection hotel - so decided to have a look at their London hotels. Doing our homework we soon found out that The Bloomsbury hotel was the new 'it' place to stay; the Dalloway Terrace restaurant and The Bloomsbury Club bar both feature heavily on all of the online 'it' spots in London. It did not disappoint! 

We have a lovely visit to the hotel - arriving at 10am expecting to leave our bags for the day, we were delighted to hear our room was ready...especially as we arrived on one of the hottest days of the year. We really appreciated being able to get into our room to freshen up before heading to the Chelsea Flower Show. 

The hotel location is fantastic - right round the corner from Tottenham Road Station so easy to jump on the tube and go anywhere in London. Walking distance to Soho which was fantastic for evening cocktails after dinner. 

On our first night we had cocktails in The Bloomsbury Club bar which was magical; fairly lights, relaxed seating, live music - there was a great atmosphere. We followed this with dinner in Dalloway Terrace sitting outside; again a lovely romantic relaxed atmosphere with great food- not to be missed. 

Our room was very well appointed with a muted cream interior - very cozy. Breakfast was also very good with lots to offer in the continental buffet and really good menu of hot food to order. 

We will definitely be back! ",5,2017,06,25
115,Lovely hotel but let down by the attention to detail,"I booked a twin room for myself and my mother but on arrival we had been allocated a standard double. I had to produce my confirmation slip to prove what i'd booked. The member of staff assured us she would rectify the problem but on arrival back at the hotel at 10.30pm we were given our room key only to go and find the room provided was a standard double. After going back down to reception, a maid was sent and it took half an hour to split the beds and remake them. A lovely hotel but shame the left hand isn't talking to the right.",3,2017,06,25
115,My favorite hotel in London!,"You could spend a lot more in London for a lot less.  I love this hotel and its friendly, helpful staff!  Gary and Brian can sort tickets for nearly anything!  If you want to go to any sporting event or theatrical show, they can get you tickets!  The rooms are not huge but very well appointed.  They put so much thought into every bit of your experience!  From a steaming pot of coffee or tea with your wake up call, to the cookies & milk that greet my daughter in our room after check in.  The location is also fantastic!",5,2017,06,23
115,MIxed Feelings,"We stayed at The Bloomsbury for 5 nights early June in a ""Deluxe"" Room. 
While the hotel is located in an excellent location, I was disappointed overall.  
Although we arrived after 2 p.m., the hotel's stated check-in time, we were forced to wait an hour and a half for our room.  We were told that the previous guests were allowed a late check-out and the room needed to be cleaned.  How fortunate for the previous guests!  How unfortunate for us.  We expected our room to be ready on arrival as promised after a long transatlantic flight.  After waiting almost 90 minutes, we were advised that our room, 211 was now ready. We had planned to refresh ourselves with a nice nap, but found this impossible due to loud construction sounds that persisted throughout our entire stay.  
In addition, we arrived back at our room one of the days at 3 p.m. and the housekeeping staff had not serviced the room yet.  
As a travel advisor, I have stayed at many hotels throughout the world.  I found The Bloomsbury not up to the great reputation, I had heard about.  
On a positive note, the breakfast selection and service was excellent.  ",3,2017,06,22
115,GREAT LOCATION!,"Nice, clean, friendly hotel in a perfect location.  Walk to British Museum, Soho, West End, Chinatown, Underground, etc. etc. etc.  All the staff was courteous and efficient.  Good size room with all the modern amenities.  ",5,2017,06,20
115,Great location,"Stayed here recently for four nights and was very happy with the accommodation. All staff are professional, polite and very helpful however a special mention should go to Adlen who works at the Darroway Terrace who came to our rescue by locating and lending us a cake stand at very short notice after we received a panicked call from our daughter who was getting married in Clerkenwell and had forgotten to get one. 

When we checked into the room I was initially disappointed to find that our room faced an inner courtyard which meant the room was very overlooked and dark. The receptionist did try to find us another room however as the hotel was busy however the only one a available was an assisted room which had a wet room which I didn't fancy so decided to stay put as we weren't planning to spend a lot of time there. The room itself was quite small (not unusual for London) but beautifully appointed, spotless and quiet.  Over the few days of our stay a couple of light bulbs went out but these were always fixed by the time we came back. 

The hotel is only a short walk from Tottenham Court Road tube station and only 10 minutes from Leicester Square. Excellent location. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel but lots of places for breakfast, lunch and dinner nearby. 

Would stay here again.",5,2017,06,20
115,Fantastic Visit,"We went to a second showing of Les Miserables after having seen it at The Queens Theater the year before.  Decided this time to stay within walking distance.  The Bloomsbury was a perfect choice.  Everyone there could not have been more gracious or helpful with anything we may have needed.  Big plus, because it's in the Theater District getting anywhere by foot was easy and an adventure in itself.  Don't hesitate to stay here.  I know w will the next time we're in London.  Thanks for a wonderful stay!",5,2017,06,19
115,Superior accommodations in a great location,"My adult daughter and I stayed at the Bloomsbury - it was very comfortable for us; the room was spacious, classy and comfortable; the hotel is ideal for couples. The hotel is very near transportation and main thoroughfares yet quiet and reserved.  The hotel is just a short walking distance to a number of theaters.  I would definitely stay at the Bloomsbury again when visiting London.",5,2017,06,18
115,"Quality, hospitality and location","Stayed here for a weekend in May. Cannot fault this hotel. Warm welcome, professional reception and front desk service. Room beautifully appointed and everything you needed. Prompt room service. Breakfast was delicious and well presented. Staff very attentive, hospitable and generous. Gorgeous coffee. Location excellent - everything was walkable for us. I would not hesitate to stay here again. Very happy indeed.",5,2017,06,16
115,Fabulously Comfortable with Five Star Service,"The location of The Bloomsbury is exactly what I needed for a business trip, but I will return with my husband for a pleasure visit when in London.  The rooms are perfect for after any long day of working or sightseeing.  The neighborhood, down the street from the British Museum and some of very tasty Indian, Thai and Korean eating joints.

But, if you do not need to run the neighborhood, you have the option, especially if you only have 1-2 nights in London, to stay in at Bloomsbury.  First, breakfast is below ground level, in an elegant setting, either cold buffet or order from the cooked menu along with the buffet. After work, cocktail on the Dallaway Terrace at The Bloomsbury, with a cool breeze, on a warm afternoon and a cocktail, was so relaxing.  When you are ready for dinner, Dallaway Terrace an elegant dinner with real comfort food items on the menu.  I can go on and on, I enjoyed every moment in The Bloomsbury.  It is also the best place for women who travel alone either on business or pleasure.  Very safe and welcoming. Fabulous experience.  This is my place to be in London.",5,2017,06,16
115,Characters make the Hotel,I was constantly impressed with the kindness and genuine hospitality of the staff at the front door and in the breakfast area. Each was gregarious and attentive upon each encounter. They provided a pleasant diverse experience. The hotel was clean and comfortable. I greatly enjoyed our stay. ,5,2017,06,15
115,Great service and location,"I've stayed at the Bloomsbury twice.  The first time I got a luxurious room, the second time an average one. But both times I enjoyed my stay. The hotel itself is beautiful and captures the feeling of a British mansion.   Appreciated the coffee and tea selection in my room and the lovely bathtub. Loved the breakfast selection.",4,2017,06,14
115,Quiet and clean,"A lovely hotel in a quiet block. The house breakfast is plentiful and well prepared, but the service is overly doting. The afternoon tea was pleasant in an outdoor dining room. Few sandwiches, mostly sweets, but excellent. Good selection of brewed tea. Service here was excellent and gracious. Our room was a junior suite. Bed fabulous, quiet halls, elegant bathroom. Only down side was there's no dressers and few hangars. We spent a week and would definitely stay again. Close to many attractions, so we walked everywhere. ",4,2017,06,14
115,Disappointing,"I have been staying in this hotel for 5 years and this time I am disappointed by the room I got. I am staying for 3 nights and have got a very small room and window is going to the window of another room. Next time I would probably choose any other hotel in this area. 

However breakfast is still tasty and luckily for me Estelita is still here. ",3,2017,06,14
115,"Great stay, as always","This is about the third time we've stayed at the Bloomsbury and it continues to shine.  Great location near British Museum and Tottenham Court tube station.  Lovely, comfortable rooms.  We particularly like the night light in the bathroom.  Only complaint is not enough shelf/towel rail space.",5,2017,06,13
115,great hotel,A real surprise. Been past it a thousand times but never bothered using it. Will do now though. Very nice. The rooms were clean (but they should be) and the furniture and decor was of a very high quality. ,5,2017,06,13
115,A little bit of luxury.,"Really lovely hotel if you don't mind paying a little extra. We only stayed one night. It is very handy location, no view and a little dim but it has a lot of character and the staff are all foreign but excellent. The breakfast was included in our stay and I think you want to include this in your booking if possible. Make sure you press the buzzer at the bottom of the stairs so a porter will help you carry your luggage up - we didn't see the buzzer till in the foyer. The staff were extremely helpful at sorting out a bigger room for my daughter and I as we did not have  twin beds, there was no extra cost. ",5,2017,06,12
115,Breakfast at the Bloomsbury,Staying at the lovely Bloomsbury for 7 days with family. The staff has been excellent! The best part of our day is Breakfast thanks to the people who work there- Maria greeted us by name and was so friendly and helpful.  Ionut our waiter was So very attentive and had a great sense of humor. We  shared pictures and joked every breakfast. Their warmth started off every day with a smile!,5,2017,06,12
115,Amazing service and cozy rooms,"The style of this hotel was really nice - our bedding was cozy and the room was furnished in a sleek but inviting style.  I loved the location - minutes from Soho dining and near the tube to easily reach further tourist sites.  Little touches, like warm hand towels at check in, were especially nice. 

Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2017,06,11
115,Beautiful hotel,"Went with another couple and had a great time. The hotel is beautiful inside and very central for most things. Room was nice and clean , bed a little on small side. Room was warm did take us a while to work out we hadn't turned the air conditioning on! All staff were really helpful and friendly checking in and out was really easy and quick. We had several cocktails in the lounge which were nicely served. I would definitely stay here again. ",5,2017,06,11
115,More than a hotel,"When we checked into our room at the Bloomsbury, I knew our stay was going to be special. A small book of poetry and a history of the hotel from its early days to the present lay by the bed.  Let others mention comfortable rooms, nice setting etc, but those two little books spoke volumes about the pride the staff took in the hotel and its its literary roots.  Unfortunately, we were about to find out how dedicated to service the staff was:  my husband took ill, required ambulance service (outstanding, by the way). A crisis, but everyone we spoke with was anxious to help - and were totally efficient.  For the next four days, we felt cared for and treated well.... even though we were probably two of the most difficult guests they had ever had.  I guess what I want to say to TripAdvisor readers is, when making hotel choices, look for service.  At the Bloomsbury, you will never have to worry.  Thanks again, gang, for greeting us every day with a smile and extra-special service. We will never forget your kindness.",5,2017,06,09
115,fantastic London hotel in the best area,"This place is fantastic! First of all, the location can't be beat. You can walk anywhere and everywhere; close to the tube and obviously easy to get a taxi/uber. The staff was super helpful in making the experience so enjoyable! The rooms are perfect and luxurious. The amenities are also great for a London stay. The restaurant was delightful and reasonably priced for such a nice hotel.",5,2017,06,09
115,Excellent Hotel in a great location,We stayed for 4 nights in early June 2017 and thoroughly enjoyed it.  With two adults and two kids we had a Studio Suite interconnected with a Deluxe Queen.  Both rooms are top notch and the suite is spacious. Breakfast was included in our rate and we had lots of choice each of which was of a high standard all well overseen by Maria. We also availed a couple of times of room service after long days and that was as expected to a high standard.  Unfortunately we couldn't get onto the Dalloway Terrace as it was consistently booked.  Hopefully next time.,5,2017,06,08
115,Overnight stay in London,"Return visit with friends for a dinner in the City.  Delighted that the already high standards have, if anything, got even better.  The welcome and checkin, bar / restaurant staff, comfort, cleanliness etc of the room were all excellent.  Very helpful concierge - getting cars organised.

It's always a bit concerning recommending a hotel to friends but they were delighted with it all as well.  Even though it's so close to the centre, it's a very calm and quiet hotel.  And the breakfast is very good.",5,2017,06,08
115,Luxury Stay,"Went to the Bloomsbury in early June 2017, and i have to say we were not disappointed. Central location, easy to find form London Euston train station.
The whole hotel was clean and tidy with rooms well laid out and having all you would need all in all an excellent hotel and we would visit again..... first class.",5,2017,06,07
115,Amable and enviable position,"Very friendly staff. Excellent and delicious restaurant Terrace inside. Room a little small but confortable. 
Too small space for preserve luggage and clothes. There are nice moments to enjoy in the room coffee or other hot drink. Even cinema, not partake now, is visible outside from Terrace.",5,2017,06,07
115,"Great hotel, great location","Stayed here for 3 nights after having visited last year also. Problem with check in on arrival, took an hour between phone calls and discussions and JC kindly resolved the issue which was on the hotel side. Disappointing start after travelling all day but JC was most apologetic, offering us drinks in the bar. Unfortunately then on Saturday morning we were woken to building works, drills/hammers going at 8.30am. Left our room at 10.00am and this was still going on. Camille contacted us and was very apologetic and offered us an upgrade which we kindly accepted. Despite these issues the hotel staff couldn't do enough for us during our stay, being so professional, friendly and helpful. Bars, terrace, food, drinks all excellent. Location is perfect, central and walking distance to Oxford Street & Tube station. Definitely will consider visiting again and will look forward to it.",5,2017,06,06
115,Great location wonderful staff,On a pretty quiet side street but just a block form Oxford st. Staff is incredibly helpful and rooms are comfortable.  Restaurants are open late and the food is very good. Would definitely stay there again ,5,2017,06,05
115,Great Hotel and staff,".                                                    My family stayed for four night at this lovely hotel

115,Lovely stay,Stayed here for a theatre break and thought it was very nice. Lobby was elegant and plush and the same goes for the room but on the small side. Breakfast was fantastic. The Dalloway Terrace bar was great as it had a nice relaxing vibe to the place. My wife wants to go back for afternoon tea with friends ,4,2017,06,05
115,Great time in The Bloomsbury,"Great time in The Bloomsbury. Everything was amazing. We enjoyed afternoon tea.
Thanks Manager JC for showing us around and giving access to the library, we will return!

115,Excellent hotel,"The Bloomsbury is a beautiful hotel in all aspects.  It is located in a prime spot - easy walking distance to multiple Tube stops, many restaurants/bars, all the shopping you could want, as well as several tourist attractions. The hotel has all the amenities you need - a very nice restaurant and bar, gym facilities, wifi, use of computers/printers for reservations and flight check in etc, and a quiet and luxurious atmosphere.  Our room and bathroom were not large by any means, but it was more than adequate for our purpose.  (We didn't travel across the ocean to spend excess time in a hotel room!) The bed and linens were extremely comfortable, and there was no noise to be heard from neighboring rooms.  We had restful sleep each night following our fun days of exploring the sites around London.  Finally, the staff of the hotel (everyone from concierge and checking in to housekeeping and restaurant staff) were friendly and cheerful.  Everyone we encountered was ready to assist us with any of our needs. Should we return to London, we'd definitely consider a return to the Bloomsbury.",5,2017,06,04
115,EXCELLENT,"We stayed here as part of my 40th birthday celebrations for three nights over a bank holiday weekend.  The room was adequate for our needs and very clean, however the mini bar was locked shut and I wanted to store some chocolates in there.  We eventually ended up changing rooms to a larger room which was equally as nice as the first.  The morning of my birthday we were served by Ionut who very kindly and unexpectedly gave me and my partner a glass of bucks fizz to celebrate.  This made my day and was a very kind gesture.  On the last morning of breakfast we were told that breakfast wanst included, however my partner thought it was.  Estelita ensured that the breakfast wasnt charged for and for that we thank her for her efforts.  Also like to say thank you to Maria and David for their service during breakfast. In all the stay was wonderful and I would recommend anyone wishing to stay in London stay at this hotel.",5,2017,06,02
115,One night only,"My wife and I stayed at The Bloomsbury for I night only we have stayed in London before at many hotels, This was picked because it was close to a show we went to see The Motown Story, from the moment that we got to the hotel we were treated with a great deal of courtesy nothing but helpful staff, you should all be congratulated for your outstanding professionalism. We have often said we will go back here or there but never did, this may be the first time that we will take up the opportunity to go back. Excellent keep up the brilliant work all you staff do.",5,2017,06,01
115,A wonderful stay,"We booked The Bloomsbury for a special occasion and we was looked after as soon as we stepped through the door.
All the staff were so helpful from reception to the restaurant staff.
We were made to fill so special and it made a wonderful time for us.",5,2017,06,01
115,Amazing ,"Stayed here with my family whilst in London, I can not recommend this hotel enough! It is all that you would expect from a five star hotel and more. Staff bent over backwards to make sure we had a wonderful stay,  even putting a tippee tent in the room for my children ( my youngest slept in it all night).  We had a beautiful dinner on the terrace,  they were very accommodating to ensure my daughters simplistic tastes were catered for.  Arriving back at the room fresh milk and cookies were supplied as a bedtime treat for the girls.  Breakfast was delicious,  staff very attentive yet unobtrusive.
Wonderful stay, will definitely be making it a return visit soon!  Special thanks to Sebastian, hotel manager,  nothing less than amazing!",5,2017,06,01
115,Great Hotel!!!,This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. They treat you like royalty!!! I had a wonderful time staying there. I would recommend it to any one.  I Loved it!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope I can stay there again some day.,5,2017,05,31
115,"Beautiful hotel, central location and very attentive staff!","This hotel does not scream for any attention. It simply receives the attention deserved by being a top hotel, with staff that care, ask if you are okay and if you want anything more, and of course has beautiful dining areas like 'The Dalloway Terrace.'

I chose to stay one night at The Bloomsbury and to dine at The Dalloway Terrace for my birthday - I opted for the brunch menu for myself and my family. The dining area was beautiful, kitted out with blossom and other pretty flowers and twinkling lights, lovely decor and furniture, all away from the hustle and bustle of London, a perfectly charming little place. The food was great (loads of gluten free alternatives for myself), hot drinks were lovely too, the crockery so pretty, and our waitress Maria ensured that my niece was a happy little girl, by giving her a lovely princess colouring book, pencils and activities to keep her amused (which she was so chuffed with!) so thank you... 

My hotel room was gorgeous, and on arrival into it there was a lovely borwnie cake and the words 'Happy Birthday' with a postcard and personal message, such lovely finishing touches to ensure a memorable stay! Room was a nice size, nice modern bathroom...The coffee machine in the room was great for a quick drink before heading out to nearby shops along Oxford Street; we wanted Hamleys for my niece, which was just 15 minutes walk, perfect location and pit-stop! 

Sebastian, the Senior Guest Relations Manager was so polite and helped us with different restaurants we could eat in when we were out and about in London, and also greeted us upon arrival at the hotel with hot towels for our hands so we felt refreshed after travelling! 

The Bloomsbury is a gorgeous hotel, and those little touches that they do make all the difference! We will come back for sure, and apparently some parts of the hotel are being done up, so there will be some new bits to see when we return, which is exciting!",5,2017,05,31
115,IMPRESSIVE IN ALL RESPECTS!,"The Bloomsbury is a shining example of how to run a hotel; it excels in all areas: location, comfort, food, ambience, value for money and the most friendly complement of staff that I've ever encountered in an hotel. And it's in that last category that I would like to single-out the following employees for the care and attention they extended to us during our stay: Ionut, Estelita, Maria, David and Sebastian. Their conduct was exemplary. I have stayed at The Bloomsbury before, and each time my expectations have been met and exceeded. Well done!
",5,2017,05,31
115,Fantastic Bloomsbury Hotel Stay,"My family had a five day stay at this lovely hotel.  We had three rooms.  All were very lovely, clean, well kept.  Loved that we were close to British Museum. We could walk to all kinds of interesting places;restaurants, stores and just beautiful walks. Buses, cabs or underground to further afar.  
The staff we met were all wonderful.  Breakfasts were delicious, always wonderful.choices.  They set the bar high for any other hotel stay.  It was wonderful to stay at a hotel that had a welcoming local feel .
Highly recommend for a stay in London.     ",5,2017,05,30
115,Great experience,"The Bloomsbury is a lovely hotel in central London, a 2 minute walk from the Tottenham Court Road station.  We were greeted upon arrival, the staff made us feel very welcome and check-in was very easy.  Our room was lovely and the amenities provided were very nice.  The breakfast in the morning was incredibly impressive with a huge variety of breads, cheeses, fruit, cereals, full English breakfast, morning drinks and more.  Exceeded my expectations.  Check-out was very simple and I was on my way.  All my encounters with staff were lovely.  Overall, great experience, I would highly recommend to anyone.",5,2017,05,29
115,Great hotel in central London. Very close to the underground station and spacious rooms!,"It was located in a really nice area and the underground station was really close by.

The room was very spacious and the bed was really comfortable. They did have a nespresso machine in the room, which was a huge plus for me as i'm a coffee lover.

The staff were all really kind and helpful, they even offer hot towels during check-in and also offered us small bottled waters when we checked-out. 

The only thing that I think they could have done better was the bathroom's layout. We stayed in 2 different rooms and they were both similar - designed lengthwise. This made it a bit awkward for me to move inside and because of the layout the floor mat is always in the way when opening the door.",5,2017,05,29
115,Excellent hotel ,"Very very good hotel. We had a wonderful stay.
It is very well located, 2 min walk to the British museum and near almost all the London touristic sights. We never took the subway or the bus.
The service in this hotel is perfect.",5,2017,05,27
115,Location and service is Excellent,"We spent four nights at the Bloomsbury and really enjoyed our time.

The location is perfect especially if you are interested in the theatre.  It is also very convenient to the British Museum.  

The Tottenham station is close by for train service. We purchased a very economically and convenient seven day Oyster Pass for access to the trains and buses.

For those who are members of YMCA, there is the first YMCA in the world just down the block. All you need is proof of membership and you get five free visits to the gym.

I would highly recommend this hotel for the service, staff and location. ",5,2017,05,27
115,Hottest Location in London ,"Love this area. It's become a mecca of trendy restaurants and bars and the hotels location couldn't be beat. Walking distance to anything you need.

The rooms - I love the wall paper in these rooms. Strange maybe it the details in this hotel are superb. The room was very clean and large. I expected a typical small London room and was pleasantly shocked with the large size of my room and bathroom. 

Also ask the hotel staff if you can see the library. It's a meeting room but has a beautiful collection of books. 

The restaurants are top notch. Dalloway Terrace is really something special. I ate there twice and the food and service was five star.

I recommend trying the scallops and the crab and crayfish ravioli. My friends had the salmon and steak which they said were both delicious. Oh and the burrata.... how could I forget. It was so fresh and melted onto the toast. 

Don't miss drinks in the famous Bloomsbury Club. I loved the effort and the story that the club has. You feel like you're in a piece of literary history having a drink there. Plus you might get a sneak peak of The Who's Who in London. 

5 stars. 
",5,2017,05,26
115,Weekend break,The hotel is in a great central location. The staff very friendly and efficient and nothing was too much trouble. The bar had a great atmosphere and the breakfast was very good with plenty of choice. Will definitely be back,5,2017,05,25
115,Excellent vist. Very classy and comfy hotel,"I stayed here just for one night but was very pleased.

The hotel is in a ideal location for access to the underground. It is very well presented and as soon as you walk in you feel more relaxed and chilled out compared to the hustle and bustle of London.

Staff were very pleasant, the bar tender in the club bar downstairs was excellent and really caught our eye.

The room is very clean and well presented. It is a bit small, but, it is an old building in central London. The quality and comfort more than made up for this.

Being a Northerner I would've loved a proper cup of simple pg tips style tea, not the fancy London ones in the room, but thats more a criticism of me not the hotel.

Lovely big bathroom and complimentary toiletries were very nice.

Highly recommended and definitely will stay again.",4,2017,05,24
115,Fantastic hotel in a great location,"Really nice hotel in a perfect location.  Close enough to walk to everything, but on a quiet street where it is easy to sleep. The staff is among the friendliest, most helpful, hotel staffs that I've ever come across.  The walls must be thick because even though the hotel was full, and I know the rooms next to me were occupied, I never heard anything from another room (and I am *very* sensitive to noise).  We had breakfast on the Dalloway terrace on our last day and I just wish we had tried it earlier. The food was much better than your typical hotel breakfast.  My husband had the French Toast and I ended up stealing most of of it.  I also ate all of my breakfast.  They also have a juicer with all kinds of interesting and yummy juices.  We're already booked to go back in October.  great place!",5,2017,05,24
115,Fantastic first trip to London,The Bloomsbury exceeded my expectations for my first trip to London. Every staff member we encountered was so helpful with recommendations for places to visit or eat. Any time we needed assistance we were promptly taken care of and made to feel at home. I have no complaints about the hotel and hope to visit again in the future. ,5,2017,05,24
115,The Bloomsbury Hotel great Russell Street London,"This is the third time I've stayed here,and apart from a long wait to check in this time, I cannot fault this hotel, I,love it.  Fab huge comfy bed, lovely clean room, nice and quiet at night.  Lovely breakfast and the atmosphere here is calm and relaxing.  Have had afternoon tea here once, disappointing, and have had nicer.  But over all a fab. Hotel, highly recommended.

115,Very pleased,"We really enjoyed our 5 day stay at the Bloomsbury.  The location was perfect for us, within walking distance to British Museum, theatres, and University.  The room was nicely appointed-large towels, robe and slippers, good coffee, turn down service with chocolates, etc.   Hotel staff were all very helpful and friendly, and we loved the hotel restaurant.    As a matter of fact we actually ate 4 meals here, and I never do that when traveling.  But the berry martini was a great start, the warm chocolate mousse was a great finish, and everything in between was delicious.  The pricing for room and restaurant was very reasonable for such high quality.  I have no complaints at all, and would definitely stay here again.  ",5,2017,05,23
115,Anniversery,"We spent our 25th anniversary here and loved it. We were here over Christmas and they even made made a goody bag for he guests! The staff was very friendly and helped us make arrangements for travel and  tours as well as helping us with converting money. The room was wonderful with a large comfortable bed. There was a small issue with the TV and I asked the front desk if they could send someone to take a look. The manager came and determined that it couldn't be fixed quickly, so he upgraded us to an even nicer room with a huge bathroom! This hotel is within walking distance to the British Museum and Tube. I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2017,05,22
115,The best central London hotel !!,"We stayed for 4 wonderful nights at The Bloomsbury. Everything was superb, a special thanks to Maria at breakfast who was so welcoming each morning and always remembered our names. The hotel is fantastic location, you can walk just about anywhere including regent street, Covent Garden, soho, Piccadilly and many more. The new bar area downstairs is beautifully decorated and makes you feel like your sat in a secret garden. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about all the cocktails on offer. If staying over a weekend you must book a table here so you aren't disappointed. Gunilla at reception was also really polite and made us feel at home. Our bedroom was a deluxe on the 6th floor and was beautifully decorated, with a lot of room and probably the quietest sleep we have had in London. We can't wait to return soon, thank you to all the staff !! ",5,2017,05,22
115,Beautiful hotel,"Just got back from this hotel, beautiful, our room was perfect ( I'm a Exec Housekeeper) the teams deserve a well done. Everything you need in the room, turn down service with choc on side. The service and pleasantness is everywhere, could not fault this hotel, great location. I will be booking with you next time I'm in London.Thank you to you all for making both mine and my husbands weekend away perfect.
Loved the touch of umbrella in my room, as it was raining Saturday, I was tempted to take it home ha ha ha..... I didn't I left it where I found it in the wardrobe lol.

Dalloway Terrace a very nice place with good food and great service. 
Would stay here again.",5,2017,05,19
115,So disappointed after such a lovely stay last year :(,"We stayed on Saturday 6th May, I waited before doing review as it saddens me to have to be negative, we stayed here in May 2016 and had wonderful time (gave it 5 stars and couldn't wait to return) May this year, a different story!
On arrival everything was fine, not quite the red carpet we had before, but after a mix up with room allocations, all was ok. Room good, the housekeeping here is impeccable and I was delighted to see a make up mirror, they had taken on board a suggestion I made and at this point, I couldn't rate this hotel highly enough, fabulous.
However things went downhill in the evening when we returned from the theatre, we went to the bar, we was looking forward to sitting, relaxing over a bottle of wine, we got to a table, was about to sit down, I was just looking for my glasses to see the wine list and a female staff said to me abruptly 'can I help you' I said oh thank you we just wanted to order a bottle of wine please, she said very rude 'we cant have you in here' I said I'm sorry, she said ' we are fully booked, no room, we cant have you in here', I was so shocked, I thought fine, I'l get a bottle of wine and take it to the terrace if they don't want the likes of us inside (we are all dressed up, not scruffy!) I asked the Barman for a bottle of red I showed him on the wine list, he said rudely 'I can't serve you' I asked again, he said 'no I wont serve you' and a waiter came up as if to escort us out of the bar, he told us we could use the terrace bar, he said follow me, people in the bar looked at us, I was mortified, we were escorted to the terrace, I again asked for a bottle of red and 2 glasses, she said to the waiter 'I cant serve them here, it needs to be in the bar downstairs' I was getting angry and upset being treated in this disgusting manner, I said 'for goodness sake, they refuse to serve us down there, now you wont serve us, all we want is a bottle of red wine, we will sit out here as we are not allowed inside, she said to waiter ' fine I'll get it, you have to do the bill downstairs' she told us to sit outside, we did, they brought a bottle of wine (not the one I wanted) and she asked for the money, I said we normally put it on our room, she said yes and took room number for the bill, she brought us a blanket, so when their guests are told they are not allowed inside, at least they give you a blanket to keep you warm! so there we were like a pair of homeless tramps, hotel guests, not allowed to use the hotel bar?! total humiliation, then to top it off the waiter from the downstairs bar, came to us after about half hour and said ' are you going to pay your bill' I said we put the wine on our room number, he asked our room number, he came back and said you did not sign for it, (they didn't ask me to sign) as I signed it, I had to smile with disbelief, they had the cheek to put £3.00 service charge on the bill! I actually paid to be treated like this!
Our stay was ruined, I didn't sleep from the upset and I still can't believe what happened. Last time breakfast was fabulous, this time they have changed to buffet for everything else, but you have to order your egg, so we ordered 2 fried eggs, sat there waiting, after about 20 minutes I asked again and eventually 2 fried eggs appeared, on the positive, the buffet stuff was hot, so well done for that, buffet breakfast is usually cool, but this was piping hot, so after a long wait, it was good, but the staff was nowhere near as nice as last time.
For some reason, our face did not fit this time, we dress smart, are clean and tidy and do not smell, so why we were treated like this, we have no idea, but we got the message loud and clear.
When I checked out the receptionist asked if we had a nice stay, I could not tell her as there was too many people there and I was afraid I might cry if I spoke about it, so I just said nothing.
I've waited a while before reviewing, as I didn't want to speak in anger, but I'm still angry and justifiably so.
What a shame, we thought we found our paradise in London (we visit London quite a lot) I love everything else about this hotel, but the bar staff has let their colleagues down on a grand scale, so shame on them, but thanks to any other staff that served us. I felt like giving it one star because of the bar/hospitality staff, but other staff do not deserve to be put in the same bracket as them.",3,2017,05,19
115,Excellent Location,"+Very close to underground, just around the corner. Buffy breakfast was good, choice's were very wide with fresh fruit, yogurt, full English, continental. Friendly staff ready to help with any questions when asked. Room was clean, and nice big comfy bed. Complimentary tea, coffee & bathroom supplies. When needed emergency conditioner it was sent up asap. Late check out a bonus and able to leave luggage to collect later. Wi-Fi good. Bottled water left in room each day.
-We found the room smaller than it looked when booking, we paid more for the Superior suit as it looked bigger. Had choc bar left each day but only 1 left and two of us staying in room! Had to ask for second dressing gown & slippers but no slippers arrived. Room was very warm, difficult to get good nights sleep with heat.",4,2017,05,18
115,Upscale Hotel in a Convenient Location,"Great, upscale London hotel located a few blocks from the British Museum and walking distance to lots of local pubs, shops, and restaurants. The room was very modern, but quite small, which is typical of most European cities. Would stay here again.",4,2017,05,17
115,Excellent hotel in London,"For the third time we stayed at the Bloomsberry and were very satisfied. A spacious studio and bathroom well appointed. 
We just regret not to be able to have just tea or coffee, orange juice and toast for a simpler breakfast.",5,2017,05,17
115,One of the greatest hotel experiences,"This hotel is perfect. A beautiful, classic building, comfortable rooms with very comfy beds and everything you could possibly need including a large umbrella. We had impeccable and friendly service from every member of staff. The lobby lounge is lovely, with comfortable furniture and a great place to have a coffee and a rest after beating the streets of London. The location is prime, just steps away from Oxford Street, 2 blocks from the British Museum and close to Soho, Fitzrovia and other great spots in London. Do not miss out on a drink in the stunning bar on the lower ground floor - The Bloomsbury Club Bar. Great cocktails, wonderful atmosphere and the friendliest staff imaginable.  Nothing was lacking at The Bloomsbury. I have no doubt that on our next trip to London we will stay there again.",5,2017,05,17
115,History and Location,"The Bloomsbury, part of the Doyle Collection chain, sits on the western edge of the Bloomsbury district, just a block off Tottenham Court Road. The hotel is a 1920s-era former women's social club and takes full marketing advantage of the area's literary heritage (the outdoor dining area, for example, is The Dalloway Terrace). The British Museum is just a five-minute walk away, although the immediate area around the hotel is commercial and a little tawdry. My room was a ""deluxe""-sized room on the top floor, right under the eaves, with skylight-style windows looking out toward the offices of the Trades Union Building next door. The room was large by London hotel standards, quiet and clean, but nothing special. Bathroom rather narrow, with black-and-white marble and one of those treacherously narrow British bath tubs with a detachable shower head. Staff, including restaurant staff in the rather dark and gloomy restaurant in the basement, were efficient but distant and seemed preoccupied. Nearest Tube, Tottenham, Court Road, is just round the corner, or you can walk to Shaftesbury Avenue and the theater district in fifteen minutes. All in all, perfectly OK if unmemorable and if you don't mind all the hubbub from Tottenham Court Road just out the door. ",3,2017,05,16
115,Good Choice,"We enjoyed our stay at this hotel.  Well-located to theaters, the British Museum and most attractions of Central London.  We had reserved a standard double room which was small and dark.  Due to a maintenance issue with the bathroom plumbing we had to move to another room which was larger and far nicer.  The staff handled the inconvenience of the room switch very professionally. The only issues we experienced were controlling the room's air conditioning system -- the room was always either too cold or too hot and stuffy., and the shower stall was small and the shower nozzle couldn't be adjusted. Also, the bath towels were not very soft. We would certainly recommend this hotel, but advise those booking to make certain they book a nicer room as the standard rooms are small, dark and not nearly as nice as others in the hotel.  ",4,2017,05,15
115,Fantastic Hotel,"We were here for my wife's birthday and it just really made everything so special for her by choosing this hotel, it just made the whole weekend perfect. If you have not been here I highly recommend that you do stay.",5,2017,05,15
115,Superb hotel in a great location,"Only have good things to say about our stay at The Bloomsbury. From a phone call in response to an email query after making the booking, through check-in and the length of our stay. The staff is extremely friendly and seem genuinely happy with their job. The public areas are luxurious, the room was a good size, the bed was extremely comfortable and the water pressure is good. The location can't be beat, 2 blocks from the British Museum, 2 minutes from Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road station, walking distance to the West End. Very good value for money at this price range in comparison to other hotels in this area. Looking forward to returning.",5,2017,05,15
115,Incredible Service,"Guests at this hotel are treated like royalty. From the second you approach the hotel you are made to feel welcome. The staff are all very friendly and professional, and the food is excellent - would highly recommend.",5,2017,05,15
115,Faultless!,"Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, we stayed here for 1 night during a weekend away in London and absolutely loved it.  The hotel itself is beautiful and our room was perfect!  Very large room with King size bed and the bathroom had 2 showers.  The room was located on the 6th floor so we could not hear any outside noise and slept perfectly.  Birthday message and chocolate also left in the room for us which was a lovely touch. The breakfast was also very good and staff are so friendly and helpful.  Thank you to Camille and one of the porters (sorry I cannot remember your name!) nothing is too much trouble and they are always happy to help.  Will definitely be returning to The Bloomsbury on our next weekend away in London!",5,2017,05,15
115,Long weekend trip,Stayed here with my wife for a long weekend. Very nice atmosphere and great location close to Oxford St. shopping area and British Museum but still in a quiet corner so the trafic is no bother. Great facilty and service and the club & terrace are extremely nice.,5,2017,05,15
115,High Standard Hotel,Am a fairly regular visitor to this hotel staying on business. Would recommend to business travellers who want a good quality experience. Staff seem well trained and there are porters on hand to help at the entrance. Rooms are of a good standard and comfortable. Obviously comes with a high price tag being central London but worth the extra. Nice atmospheric bar downstairs with great choice of beers and spirits.,4,2017,05,13
115,Fantastic hotel,"Cannot fault this hotel the service is excellent. Wherever you turn there is a friendly member of staff discretely waiting to help you.Hot towels on arrival at reception. The Dalloway terrace is lovely for a sunny lunch- they do a great small plates menu.  The Bloomsbury bar is cosy and romantic with a good drinks selection. It's a perfect location for a theatre trip not far from Euston but far enough. The rooms are spacious for London and quiet and beds are comfy, nespresso machine. Turndown service. The only thing missing was a chocolate on the pillow. We had breakfast at a lovely cafe (salt and pepper) round the corner as the hotel breakfast is pricey. However I'm sure it's lovely because everything else was and we got a good room rate online. Will definitely return with husband (this was a girls trip) it was such a good experience. ",5,2017,05,12
115,Beautiful hotel in great location,"A beautiful hotel with a charming history (it was the first YWCA in London).  It has been renovated beautifully.  It's very close to both Tottenham Court Road tube, Covent Garden and Holborn tubes so it easy to get to most places.  The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom, although very compact was clean with good amenities. (the moisturiser also works!). Staff were amenable to a slightly later check out and were always friendly.",5,2017,05,11
115,A Brilliant Classy and Friendly Hotel,"We are checking out this morning, but we do not want to leave! 

The location is perfect. Just a 5 minute walk to the tube station, theatres surrounding them and restaurants everywhere! 

The service within this place is nothing short of great. All the staff are friendly. Greeting you as you pass them, checking we are comfortable and enjoying ourselves. Incredibly informative and creative to meet solutions. 

My partner and I stayed in a standard double room and it was lovely and cosy.

I highly recommend their Dalloway restaurant and bar. Brilliant gourmet food and amazing cocktails, accompanied by snacks with friendly and efficient service. (I will review these two separately).",5,2017,05,11
115,Family friendly in the theatre district.,"My 9 year old daughter and I stayed at the Bloomsbury on a quick trip to London to see a performance of the London Shakespeare Company's Matilda.  The hotel is in a great theatre district location, quiet, comfortable, and the staff very friendly.  The concierge greeted my daughter with a book!  The doorman, was extremely helpful with walking directions and restaurant recommendations.  On our return from the theatre a package had been left behind for us by the same helpful staff member- a paperback copy of Roald Dahl's Matilda book!  Very touching! I wanted to share this snapshot of how hospitable and family friendly the staff of this gorgeous hotel are.",5,2017,05,10
115,"We had a great visit, thank you!","We spent 10 nights at the Bloomsbury in early April. From our first contact with Sebastian at our arrival, it was an overall great experience. It’s just down the street from the British Museum, and a short 2 blocks to the Tottenham Court Rd tube stop. Within a ½ mile there are numerous restaurants, shops etc…..and who says it always rains in London. We were there for 10 days and never once did we pull out our rain jackets or umbrellas, go figure…
We had a Full English Breakfast included in our reservation and it was excellent, and there is nothing like fresh squeezed OJ!! Special thanks to Sebastian, Giorgi, Nina, Ivan, Maria and Thel. I also wanted to mention the Manager at Breakfast who was out for most of our stay, but did leave a lasting impression.",5,2017,05,08
115,Excellent hotel in great location,"A great boutique hotel located in central location just 1 minute walk from Oxford street.
The room (supirior double) was clean and comfortable with qween size double bed.
Coffee machine and tea / coffee was awailable.
Great English breakfast is served in the pleasant dining room.
The crew was very welcoming and did everything to make our stay as pleasant as possible.
The hotel also has a nice bar club and a great porch.
Bottom line the hotel is very recommended for couples vacation.",5,2017,05,08
115,Excelelnt hotel!,"Very friendly and extremly clean and staff very polite and helpful! But also breakfast was great, overall we had a agreat time and our stay could not have been any better. Look forward to visit again!!",5,2017,05,08
115,Hotel with a story,"If you want to stay in a hotel where the hotel is part of the reason for your trip then stay here! Short break for my wife's birthday was greatly enhanced by the staff, the atmosphere, just the simple pleasure of being there. Clearly the owners, management team  and staff love the place and it shows in their attitude to customers. Will return just to enjoy the Bloomsbury again.",5,2017,05,08
115,Great location and the best staff I have experienced,"We chose the hotel for its location and traditional style. The amenities and rooms were great but the real differentiator was the staff.  There seemed to be more customer facing staff than I have experienced and they were so ""on it"" without being intrusive.  Both individually and as a team, the staff were efficient, interested, watchful - I simply cannot enthuse enough and I have stayed in great hotels all over the world.  Well done to The Bloomsbury",5,2017,05,05
115,Excellent Quiet Location,This is a gem of a hotel especially if you are on a leisure trip as we were. The location close to Tottenham Court Road underground station and within easy walking distance of Covent Garden and adjacent to the British Museum makes this a brilliant place to be based. Our room was of modest size but very adequate and very comfortable and fully equipped. The partially open terrace bar offers very good late night light dining that is just right after a full lunch. Staff were very friendly too. This hotel is a wonderful option to the large and less personal hotels. ,4,2017,05,03
115,Amazing Hotel Experience,I couldn't have asked for anything more.  Have used this hotel several times and have always been impressed with the level of service and the staff.  Nothing is too much trouble and the warm welcome from the front door through to the general staff always impresses me.,5,2017,05,03
115,Perfect Location for a weekend in London,"My partner and I returned to the Bloomsbury after a break of almost 15 years. Since our last visit the hotel has been relaunched in the Doyle Collection and is better than ever. Everything just works without any fuss and drama. Every member of staff with whom we had dealings, without exception, was clearly well trained, did a very good job and gave the impression of enjoying what they do. They were engaging without being intrusive and were very responsive when needed. Worthy of special mention is the wonderful Maria in the restaurant who immediately recognized us after a 15-year break.
Very comfortable large bed with sensational pillows.  
We would recommend the Bloomsbury without hesitation and plan to return again during the summer.",5,2017,05,02
115,Breakfast,"I didn't stay at The Bloomsbury but found it by chance when the hotel St Giles was so 2 Star all round.   I breakfasted at The Bloomsbury and it was delightful from the Concierges to the professional smiling service in the Dalloway Terrace breakfast space.   
Each morning greeted by name (even though I was not a guest),  my breakfast choices were remembered and I was made very welcome.   Food and coffee lovely.   Last morning was my Birthday and I was greeted with Birthday wishes.  When paying,  I was told there was no charge for my birthday breakfast!   My thanks again to everyone there and special mention to Alaeddine, David, Maria, Marina.   The Bloomsbury management are very fortunate to have such professional warm staff.  Until we meet again..... thank you from ""Miss Gilmour"". Dorothy",5,2017,05,02
115,"Perfect, couldn't have asked for more ","A friend and I stayed at The Bloomsbury for the weekend to conveniently enjoy the best of the West End. The hotel was absolutely wonderful, and everything from the incredibly warm welcome to the fantastic room and lovely bar completely surpassed our expectations. We had a deluxe room which was luxurious and spacious, featuring all the facilities you would need for a weekend away. We loved the hotel bar which was very smart and stylish and got to enjoy an enjoy a late tipple in the very cool and beautiful Dalloway Terrace which served delicious margaritas!  In terms of location, if you want to be in the heart of the west end you would be hard pressed to find a better hotel. Oxford Street shopping, the restaurants on Charlotte Street and bars of Soho are all within a short stroll and choice of tube stations are nearby to get around the rest of London. 

Thank you for making our bank holiday weekend such a memorable one! ",5,2017,05,02
115,Bloomsbury one night stay,"Nice hotel in good location, staff very friendly. The only drawback was the size of the room, very small, in fact if I had been staying more than one night I would of asked to be moved, it was quite difficult to move around the room with two people in it.",4,2017,05,01
115,Comfortable and elegant,"We stayed for 2 nights in a superior room.  The location was important to us.  We were within a few minutes walk of Tottenham Court Road tube station and buses to all parts of London.  The staff at the hotel were knowledgeable and helpful about providing bus information.  We made use of our bus passes and experienced no problems doing so.  The room was comfortable and well fitted with plenty of wardrobe and drawer space.  The bathroom was on the small side and the shower was over the bath.  It was, however, well equipped.  The hotel has an interesting history and information is provided in the room.  Take time to look at the poet portraits while they are still on the premises.  We only had breakfast in the hotel.  This was excellent with plenty of choice and attentive service.  Our check out was extended by an hour to enable us to experience more of London.  The ambience and atmosphere of the hotel are pleasing and make for a relaxing stay.  All the staff we encountered were polite, helpful and friendly.  If I have one reservation it is the notice outside that says permission has been applied for to extend the bar opening hours until 2.00 a.m. and to have a music licence.",5,2017,04,30
115,Super little bistro hotel in the heart of London,"Wish I had found this place years ago. We needed somewhere central to stay over between a show and lunch. The hotel is clean, crisp and efficiently run. The room are neat with all the facilities you require (although I would ponder how you are supposed to get your hotel supplied mug to successfully mate with the complementary Nexpresso machine - answer deconstruct said machine - I do need an expresso to start my day).
Had a very good nights sleep, possibly aided by the post show nightcap or two in the cocktail bar. The room was inward facing so we had no noise at all. Such a joy in the centre of London. Breakfast was good, with some of the best coffee I can remember.
Will return, well done.",5,2017,04,29
115,Still very good if you like the location,"I'd say it's 4 star quality. Friendly helpful service, nice entrance,decor etc but not overly fancy, good bar scene. Nice comfortable bed. Quiet room on 4th floor. .Minuses are: it's getting a little bit tired, shower not great, kettle was broken.",4,2017,04,28
115,Terrible experience,"I've received (without any notice) a room that is reserved for handicapped.
In the middle of the night there was a fire alarm, there was no response in the phone, I needed to go down (like many other guests) to find out, it was a problem in the kitchen and that they cannot fix it.
The entire floor where I stayed was noisy all the time by employers changing furnitures to one of the rooms. ",2,2017,04,27
115,Lovely overnight stay,"We stayed for our wedding anniversary, lovely hotel, friendly, helpful staff throughout our stay. Lovely touch of rose petals in our room to celebrate and a great breakfast to finish off our stay. Definitely would stay here again, great central location without feeling as though your in central London.",5,2017,04,26
115,A nice boutique hotel with a story and character ,"We immediately fell in love with this hotel the moment we were welcomed at the lobby. Elegantly decorated, fresh and new ambience, friendly staff. The room and the bed were very comfortable and I particularly loved the fluffy slippers provided in the room. 

It wasn't until I looked up the little book of The Bloomsbury history at the room did I know the hotel was established hundred years ago. It is amazing to see how well the building and , most importantly, the spirit of hospitality was preserved in a such perfect way. 

The location is great too which is just a few minute walk from the underground. Covent Garden and Oxford Street are also within walking distance. 

Will definitely consider staying with The Bloomsbury again in my next visit in London. ",4,2017,04,25
115,A classic hotel. ,"My wife and I spent London marathon weekend at this exceptional hotel. From the moment elegantly dressed gentleman opened the doors until we said our goodbyes to Sebastian and his colleagues this was a truly wonderful experience of old time charm and class.
The atmosphere created by all staff makes this hotel a 5 star experience. What came across is people who actually like and take pride in their jobs. If it is restaurant recommendations or directions the concierge and front of house staff will cater for your request. The cleaning staff are warm and friendly and the atmosphere in the bar is more relaxing than any spa! 
My only concern is that The Bloomsbury may become to popular and make reservations more tricky! A wonderful stay thanks to you all. ",5,2017,04,24
115,Weekend break in London,Excellent location with restaurants and theatres close at hand. Very comfortable and quiet room. Friendly and helpful staff. This was our second stay at this hotel and we look forward to paying a return visit in the future.,5,2017,04,24
115,A Wonderful Spot in London,"The Bloomsbury is my home base in London and it never disappoints.   Very helpful staff, comfortable room and perfect location for me.   Near the bustle of Oxford Street and Soho, this place is a classy oasis of charm and comfort. And, i think it's an excellent deal. 
Highly recomend.",5,2017,04,23
115,A Great London Hotel Experience,"We had a 3 night stay at The Bloomsbury as part of London stopover during a 2 month trip around Europe & UAE. During this trip we've stayed in many hotels that have not meet the level of comfort nor provided the features promoted on their Websites, The Bloomsbury is not one of them, form the moment we stepped into the Hotel we knew this was going to be a great 3 day stay.
The ambience of the reception and lounge area has a regal but comfortable feel. When we first entered our suite our eyes lite up, it was spacious and beautifully decorated. Everything worked the way it should have, The bed was massive and inviting, the furnishings were well chosen to make the room as comfortable as posible. The bathroom was large the walk in shower was large and worked perfectly! The bathtub was enormous and according to my wife there was excellent lighting. We used room service during and again were not let down, the food was excellent.
The found the location of the hotel was very convenient, with a huge number of restaurant and cafe choices at our doorstep. 
We have stayed at eleven different hotels over this holiday, all rated 4 or 5 star, none came close to matching ""The Bloomsbury Hotel"" this was the only hotel that exceeded our expectations.    ",5,2017,04,22
115,"Perfect location, great staff and service","Perfectly located near Oxford street and the tube station.
Lovely staff, very friendly especially with my kid!! Lest her milk and cookies in the room every afternoon and Easter eggs for the Holiday.
Would love to come back and stay there.",5,2017,04,22
115,An amazing find in our Capital,"This was amazing from start to finish from the initial welcome, attention to detail,friendly helpful staff, the beautiful room, fabulous breakfast selection and much more.
We were blown away by the attention we had and how special the staff managed to make us feel. We had mentioned we were celebrating our 19th wedding anniversary on the preliminary booking and they really did acknowledge us in so many ways, we were really touched.
Everything was magical and we cant fault it in any way. 
We highly recommend this wonderful hotel and will definitely return",5,2017,04,20
115,Afternoon tea,"I did not stay at this hotel, but chose to have afternoon tea for my daughters birthday there. It's a very lovely place, a very short walking distance from the British Museum. 
We had champagne to start our experience! Everything was servered very proper, my daughter just loved it! The food was wonderful, more than enough for two. Tanveer, who served us that day, was exceptional, made sure we had everything we needed, and asked if there was anything more we would like. 
When I made the reservation, I indicated it was a birthday celebration, not really expecting anything. Boy was I wrong, they presented my daughter with a simple, but beautiful cake on a plate decorated with ""happy birthday"". And best of all, which my daughter repeated over and over, He even sang to me"". 
Thank you Tanveer for making my daughters birthday so special!",5,2017,04,20
115,Family London Break ,"We booked two double rooms at the Bloomsbury for a family trip to London. This hotel is beautiful inside & out. The rooms are luxurious & have everything you could need. Which includes, bath robes, slippers, umbrella, iron, iron board to mention just a few. There is a tv on the walls which includes sky sports and BT sports which my Husband was grateful for. However, although all of the above is lovely. What really makes The Bloomsbury stand out from the rest, is the customer service & the attitude of all their staff. They couldn't do enough for you, from opening doors to offering to help with luggage. They're all so friendly and make you feel so welcome & special. We travelled with our 6 year old Son and they even left treats out for him & brought him milk and cookies at night! The location is brilliant and only a two minute walk to the tube station & around the corner around a 15 min walk to Piccadilly Circus and the main sights of London. We also ate here at the restaurant and the food was absolutely wonderful!! We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again on our next London visit as everything was faultless here at The Bloomsbury. Thank you very much for a perfect stay.  ",5,2017,04,20
115,Excellent Service and Location,"If you are looking for a hotel with excellent service and a convenient location, then I highly recommend The Bloomsbury. Every staff member I encountered was friendly, efficient, and accommodating, beginning with Sabastian, who processed my check-in. The elegant, but comfortable lobby immediately provided a warm and inviting introduction to a hotel that delivers a high level of service. I agree with other reviewers that the location on Great Russell Street is relatively quiet. Although it's around the corner from Tottenham Court Road and its convenient Tube stop, it seems a world away. I specifically chose this hotel because of its proximity to theatres and museums. In fact, the British Museum is a short walk away, while most theatres are easily accessed on foot. Regardless of how you decide to get around London, you should chose The Bloomsbury if you value good service in charming, centrally located accommodations.",5,2017,04,19
115,Weekend break,"Had a nice first time stay recommended by a friend, definitely will be back. Good food, nice bar & restaurant. Did not have breakfast as we left early both mornings but offerings seemed plentiful. Rooms were comfortable & very clean. 
Concierge & receptionist very helpful with directions & assisting with luggage.
Will be back. 
",4,2017,04,18
115,Great place to stay!,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury for 6 nights, and everything was great. Especially the concierge did an amazing job to make us feel at home. The restaurants they recommended, and the places to visit were great. Overall the hotel is very comfortable, and excellent to rest after a long day touring the city.",5,2017,04,17
115,2nd visit ,"The Bloomsbury certainly didn't disappoint . This being our 2nd stay there. We love the location short walk from Oxford street. The standard room is very comfortable and super clean. Great room facilities, bathrobe, slippers, good quality toiletries and perfect for coffee drinkers having a coffee machine in the room, as well tea making facilities. This time we indulged in the afternoon tea, we opted for the sparking one which included a glass of bubbly each for £35pp . It was lovely you get a lot and the cakes were amazing 😋. The feel to the hotel is lovely, very serene and relaxing. The club bar is also great for a few nightcaps. As it was my birthday they left a lovely cake in the room, which was a lovely touch. I'm sure we will be making a 3rd visit in the near future. ",5,2017,04,17
115,Wonderful London visit,"We recently spent a week in London and had the pleasure of staying at The Bloomsbury. The hotel ambience made us feel as if we were staying in a lovely home. The taff was friendly and helpful. The best part of our stay was breakfast. When we walked in the door every morning we were greeted by Maria, by name. It was lovely. George was our waiter and he did a wonderful job helping us to choose items that agreed with our allergies. We also had dinner there a few nights and Camila was friendly and knowledgeable. It was a wonderful experience. We can't wait to go back!",5,2017,04,16
115,Fabulous!  The people and great service make it so.,"While this hotel is very nice, what made it outstanding was the people and customer service focus.  Especially the guest relations folks (Sebastian, Bryan, Camille) and also Ivan and the young lady who checked me in (sorry, I'm forgetting her name).  I was with a business group but on my own for the last day, and these folks went out of their way to make me feel like a treasured guest and a friend.  Would definitely recommend and stay there again when in London.",5,2017,04,14
115,Another enjoyable stay,"Having stayed at The Bloomsbury on previous occasions, our latest visit proved equally enjoyable. Our superior double room was spacious and immaculate and we found the hotel staff extremely efficient.
Breakfast in large hotels can often be hit or miss but on this occasion we were pleasantly surprised. The service was excellent and the food of a very good standard. ",5,2017,04,12
115,Afternoon tea at The Bloomsbury,"I visited here on Saturday for afternoon tea with a group of friends as part of my hen do. Even though I arrived rather late (bride's prerogative!) the staff were so lovely and welcoming.

Nothing was too much trouble for them and they played along with some activities my bridesmaids had organised with good humour. The tea itself was delicious, with far too much food to finish but luckily they were more than happy to box up our leftovers! They were also very attentive at refilling our drinks and offering alternatives if required.

It was the perfect start to our day.",5,2017,04,10
115,"Great building, quiet, good location.","Very disappointed to find we had booked here, after enjoying it 4 years ago, knowing we could have a drink on the terrace and the terrace was closed! No one mentioned that. 2 of our rooms were ready for us but the third was not and although the friend who had booked for us had signed her name we all had her down as Mr on our paperwork. A few niggles but it was a couple of days for a special occasion ..... The staff were very friendly and very pleasant. The rooms were fine, although I had trouble with my keys at first. My room was a bit dark but for the time we were there it didn't matter too much. One of my friends wasn't warned that there were workmen right outside her window on the 7th floor which was a bit of a shock.",4,2017,04,08
115,"Delightful, convenient hotel","Second time I've stayed here. Perfect location, lovely place. It is spotless, elegant, and a pleasure to come ""home"" to after a busy time in London. The room is a bit small, but comfortable and has all the amenities. ",5,2017,04,08
115,Very sumptious and excellent service,"Hotel was excellent, very sumptious and lovely in a great location for going to theatre. Whilst checking in receptionist asked about our plans and I advised we were there for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child theatre show - we went up to our room and the general manager came to the door with two complimentary programmes for the show which was a lovely touch. I do have one comment regarding breakfast; when we checked in we were asked if we wanted breakfast, we said yes and were given price of £18.50. Next morning we went for breakfast and were told we hadn't paid for it and server explained £18.50 for continental and more for full which we agreed to. Then even though we hadn't checked out yet, a bill was presented with 12.5% service charge which I did not really agree with. If breakfast had been added to room bill as expected that wouldn't have had the service charge. Also breakfast is self service albeit a cup of coffee was poured which does not warrant applying service charge. I think this should be explained better at check in and also added to room bill without the 12.5%. Small point and does not take away from the rating and the quality of the hotel.",5,2017,04,07
115,Elegance at The Bloomsbury,"We had a two night weekend break at The Bloomsbury and we couldn't praise the hotel highly enough. After a very hectic week we arrived in London exhausted, but the staff were so welcoming that all that happened during the week was forgotten. We had a siesta on arrival, the pillows and bed linen were so luxurious we over slept. The breakfast was fabulous, the fresh fruit exactly what we needed. Can't wait to go back",5,2017,04,07
115,Very disappointing afternoon tea,"We arrived to find that that tea venue was closed.  We were crammed into a small table in the lobby surrounded by  business people in meetings who were loud and rude.  The service was good,but were charged for a second glass of champagne which is unlimited at most places.  The food and tea was excellent, but the ambience and limited champagne were not.  It was a special treat for a friend and I was disappointed and embarrassed....",3,2017,04,05
115,Great for families,"Stayed in the Bloomsbury for a long weekend with our 4 year old. The hotel is absolutely fantastic for families...from the tepee bed, teddy and milk & cookies at bed time...our 4 year old was VERY happy. All of the staff were very friendly...but a special mention to Sebastian & Brian on concierge. Breakfast was lovely, food in restaurant also very nice & room very comfortable & of good size. Would definitely stay again. ",5,2017,04,04
115,OMG! The BEST Customer Service in a very long time!!!,"There are far too many compliments I could give this hotel...... I could type all day.
Expectations in the hotel industry is generally high, we all want great service and to live as good - if not better - than we do at home. This EXCEEDED our expectations by a mile.
When we were ""damsels in distress"" everything about this hotel was superb. 
From the candle-lit, beautiful aroma of a welcoming reception hallway, great concierge, and then a lovely cosy restaurant with service like nothing before. 
I have to highly commend Camila, Eljesa & Barber - the girls were exceptional. We were very stressed and upset from a previous hotel booking (Opposite this one!) and the girls took control of our situation. Went to their reception, worked out a rate and accomodation, gave us a complimentary wine to help us feel welcome and made everything soooooo much of a pleasure. 
Not just as we were so upset, but just because you could tell it was 'their role' to help us and go beyond regular customer service.
The senior guest relations manager continued this excellent service; Sebastian. We saw him several times during our 1 night stay and always continued the excellent service set. We will continue to use The Bloomsbury as our London base each time we are in the city.
For discreet, superior customer service, aside from beautiful Aromatherapy Associates ameneties in the rooms and the custom made candles, the whole experience was perfect. We are global travellers for business, this was a perfect stay. 
Looking forward to the next London trip to have dinner, lunch or an overnight stay - whichever comes first!

The staff are an asset to a beautiful, discreet hotel.

Thank you so much!",5,2017,04,04
115,better room last time,"Great hotel, perfect location.  My only disappointment was that although I was supposedly upgraded I had a better room last time. Although on a higher floor there was another building very close to my window, more amenities in room last year.  And the Dalloway Terrace was closed.

On the other hand the concierge team, Dale, Ivan, Pavel could not have been more helpful.",4,2017,04,03
115,Bloomsbury is Excellent- 5 Stars ++,"A fantastic hotel to stay at for location, luxury rooms, service, food, and friendly professional staff. 5 stars and more on all accounts.
We will be staying here again and highly recommend it. We had a very pleasant stay right from check in, all staff were friendly and greeted us with smiles and were given hotels to refresh our hands at reception. nice touch. The rooms are very well decorated with top quality furniture and fittings and the bed was amazing! Thanks you Bloomsbury Hotel and Staff! ",5,2017,04,03
115,Perfect birthday surprise,"My boyfriend surprised me by booking a nights stay at the Bloomsbury for my 30th birthday after a visit to the Queen's Theatre to see Les Misérables at the matinee showing. We arrived early but as our room was ready we were allowed to check-in and drop off our bags. Check-in included a hot towel. The room was lovely, a good size, very clean and had all the facilities we needed for our stay including a Nespresso machine for morning coffee. As we unpacked there was a knock on the door. As my boyfriend had told them it was a surprise and my 30th birthday a member of staff was at the door with a bottle of champagne, a chocolate birthday cake and a card from the hotel wishing me a happy birthday. It was such a surprise and a lovely touch. We popped open the champagne and enjoyed it before heading out for the afternoon. The Club Bar on the lower ground floor was truly something special and very relaxing to enjoy cocktails and glasses of wine after an afternoon out in London before heading back to the room. It wasn't too busy on a Saturday night either. When we entered our room there were chocolates on our bed and dressing gowns and slippers had been placed on the bed. We were on the third floor and heard no noises during the night and slept very well. The staff at the Bloomsbury were very efficient and friendly which really made our stay. We also thought the rates were very reasonable given the location and quality of the room and hotel facilities. I would highly recommend and look forward to returning when the Dalloway Terrace is reopened.",5,2017,04,02
115,Another superb stay,"This is our third stay at The Bloomsbury .. why would we stay anywhere else? From the easy check in on Friday to our effortless check out this afternoon our stay was brilliant. We stayed on the sixth floor. A lovely understated superior double it was really quiet with a very comfortable bed .
Breakfast was excellent . Staff were smiling and helpful. They clearly wanted visitors to enjoy their stay.
The location is fantastic within walking distance of the West End and numerous restaurants . 
We had a brilliant break and won't hesitate to book our next London break at ... yes you've guessed it The Bloomsbury ! Thank you .. we had a fantastic stay at your  hotel and thoroughly recommend it to others. Stay here, you won't be disappointed.",5,2017,04,02
115,Good value,"Good value when compared to similar hotels in central London. Good location for shops and theatres. Hotel is of period character. Room small but perfectly formed with all the necessary facilities inc tea making iron air con etc. Clean and well serviced.
Would recommend without hesitation.",4,2017,03,31
115,Perfect Theatre Break Venue,"The hotel is ideally located for a number of the big theatres as well as being a 5 minute walk from the British Museum. A very nicely appointed Hotel with lovely rooms and a nice atmosphere. The thing that set it apart from other hotels we have visited in London was  the Staff. A superb team from Sebastian on the front desk to the doorman, everyone was so helpful and friendly. We really cant imagine staying anywhere else in the area after experiencing the Bloomsbury.",5,2017,03,31
115,5 Star Experience,"The Bloomsbury is an historic hotel very well located in the West End of London. This is truly a 5 Star experience. The rooms are very well appointed and the staff are friendly, efficient and helpful. The bar in the lower ground floor level is a great venue for drinks, cocktails and food. Afternoon tea is served on the ground floor and all forms of service are superb.",5,2017,03,30
115,"Nice room, dodgy wine bottle, confusing breakfast","Booked the Bloomsbury very late as the room I was given in the over booked Radisson Blu Kenilworth just along the road was the smallest room I have ever had...that's for another review.

The Bloomsbury is a different league to the two Radisson's just along the road. Very nice room though when I took the wine out of the mini bar it had obviously already been opened as the seal was broken. Strange in an auto charge mini bar, I phoned reception and eventually, about 30 minutes later, they sent a replacement free of charge.
Bed really comfy, good nights sleep.
Breakfast - after coffee and juice no one ever came to take my order so I just had some food from the buffet which was fine, would have liked to have ordered a cooked breakfast but no one seemed to be taking orders. 

Nice place, will stay again.",4,2017,03,28
115,Afternoon Tea,"I went to The Bloomsbury with my friends last week for an afternoon tea. The place was very cozy; perfect for relaxing and doing some catching up with friends. But it wouldn't have been a great experience if we didn't have Joel, who warmly attended us during our stay.  ",5,2017,03,27
115,Weekend Stay,Hotel overall was great. We were there from Friday through Sunday. Only disappointment was that the Dalloway Terrace was closed (we knew this when we booked) and the ambience of the alternative which was the dinning room was very poor (but food and service still good). ,5,2017,03,27
115,Superb Hotel,"Great Hotel in a great location - we have been here before and the high standards have been maintained - the staff are friendly and very efficient and the quality of the food served is superb - the Hotel is a short walk from several theatres, Chinatown and the shopping area - well done The Bloomsbury!",5,2017,03,27
115,Afternoon Tea,"Enjoyed a lovely afternoon tea in the ""Dalloway Lounge"" yesterday. We were shown to our table immediately on arrival and within minutes had been offered our first pot of tea. There was an impressive selection of black, white and green teas on the menu. The food was of a high standard and well presented. We were asked if we would like our sandwich plate refilled, to which we said yes as they tasted so good. I would definitely go again as it contributed to a lovely day in our capital city.",5,2017,03,26
115,"Fantastic location, great service!","Fairly spacious room for a London hotel! Steps away from the British Museum. Steps away from the nearest tube station.  Location location location.  It is definitely well worth the money.  The hotel staff are friendly and courteous.  Lots of plug in outlets thank goodness.  Nespresso machine in room!  Best in room coffee! 
First time in England, so this is something I did not know.  There is no ice machine.  They do not exist. This is a North American thing.  So... every night I would call room service for ice, which would take a few hours... it comes from the restaurant.  They were fairly good, but the one night I had to call again because they forgot.  
But it's okay, because they were super accommodating by bringing me a huge bucket of ice.  Sorry, I prefer my drinks to be cold.",5,2017,03,26
115,"Beautiful hotel, good service","Loved the hotel. It's close to Tottenham Ct. and Oxford Circus stations. It's also really close to major shopping outlets. I like to workout - they have a tiny gym, but there's an excellent YMCA right opposite them. Rooms are comfortable, good WiFi as well. I'd recommend this to business travelers. I do think my room was a tad bit small for people traveling with kids. The service staff are excellent...and very polite.",4,2017,03,25
115,Third time lucky!,The third time I've stayed at The Bloomsbury. Reason for staying was because of our great stays before. We stayed with our kids this time. The kids were royally treated with a teepee tent over a bed and bathroom accessories. Really lovely touch. Again the staff were polite and nothing was a problem. Cannot fault the Dalloway Terrace. Really good addition. The food was beautiful too in a really nice setting.,5,2017,03,24
115,Beautiful Hotel!,"We had a wonderful experience at The Bloomsbury from start to finish. I had previously called to see if we could have an early check in as we had a big day ahead and they said they could not guarantee but would see what they could do. Upon arrival at 10.30am not only were we greeted with a friendly smile and a warm towel to refresh, our room was ready! The staff were helpful, efficient and friendly from start to finish, the hotel itself is beautiful and quite grand without being pretentious and the room was spacious and clean. When we arrived back from our big day out there was even a birthday cake and message waiting for my husband as I had mentioned it had recently been his 40th, which was wonderful! The bar was splendid and the service was excellent. The location was perfect, close to tube, theatres, restaurant, bars and shopping. All in all it is a wonderful hotel with excellent staff and we will definitely be back!",5,2017,03,24
115,Outstanding ,"The hotel is well appointed, extremely clean and welcoming. It is set in the heart of Bloomsbury within easy walking distance to many of central london's attractions. I'd had a long and arduous journey and upon my arrival the concierge recognised this and provided me with hot damp towels to freshen up. My room was spacious with a delightful bathroom. The bed was superb and extremely comfortable (so much so that I overslept). Sound proofing from the 24 hour London background noise was excellent. The food is out of this world, from breakfast through to evening meal. Although the a la carte breakfast sounds expensive, it is definitely worth it.  All staff were extremely attentive, from management right through to housekeeping. Nothing was too much trouble. I even had an unsolicited meeting with the hotel customer relations manager, Eljesa, who was extremely helpful and polite, enquiring as to how my stay could be improved. She is certainly an asset to the organisation.  I have stayed at numerous London hotels, and have decided that this will be my hotel of choice for the future. Highly recommended. ",5,2017,03,22
115,great hotel,"very nice hotel with very friendly staff and a good breakfast would defiantly  recommend. good location and very well kept will be staying again as soon as we can, there is also a carpark across the road.",5,2017,03,21
115,Above and Beyond!,"My colleague and I had an amazing experience at The Bloomsbury London.  The staff went above and beyond. Everyone went out of their way to make us feel welcomed after we had 2 horrible experiences at neighboring hotels that the same day.  The Bloomsbury not only was able to provide us with last minute rooms, they also gave us wine on the house during our amazing meal in their restaurant and free breakfast the next day.  All we were looking for was a place to lay our heads that wasn’t in the midst of construction or so dodgy that we didn’t feel safe, and The Bloomsbury went above and beyond.  I will never stay anywhere else in London.  The absolute best!  Thank you.",5,2017,03,17
115,Excellent stay in a lovely neighborhood,"Hotel was beautiful and in a great neighborhood--close to the tube and lots of great pubs and shops nearby. Staff were all very friendly and accommodating. Nightly turn down service was a lovely touch. Also, appreciated the hotel bar, which was not only beautifully decorated but served delightful drinks as well. Just a few minor points that keep the Bloomsbury from a full five-star review: the bed had some sort of gap/lump between the two sides. It was a king-size bed, so more than enough room to sleep around the gap, but mentioning it as it was slightly odd. Also, one of two treadmills in the gym was very wobbly (preventing you from running much about 6 mph for fear the machine would collapse!) That said, the overall experience was certainly a positive one, and I would absolutely return.",4,2017,03,16
115,1th time,"I visited this nice friendly and good situated hotel at Monday staying only 1night and spending all day at Training at Academy-but it is nice hotel with good breakfast. Maybe just need more dusting and refreshing curtains at room. But price was unbelievable good.will not expect that at London.
Thank you for nice service. Staff is bilingual ( I manage to speak polish with few ladies what is great as I do not used polish often!)
will recommended and back.
",4,2017,03,15
115,Exceptionsl hotel and service,"We booked this hotel for a 50th birthday celebration and the hotel did everything they could to make the stay so memorable and special.  On checkin we were allowed to check in early and upgraded our room due to my birthday celebrations.  the hotel even left a personalised birthday card and cake in our room as a surprise.  I asked if a late check out was available and this was also available on request.  Hotel staff are exceptional friendly courteous and polite, the ambience was decadent and overall customer experience second to none.  I would rate this hotel 5 star and would definitely revisit and recommend it to my friends and family.  My only disappointment was that I was not staying longer but most definitely will be back.",5,2017,03,15
115,Absolutely Fantastic,"From the second we arrived to the time we had to sadly say goodbye, the staff treated us like royalty. It is a truly fantastic hotel in a great location for exploring London. Breakfast was amazing and made all the more special when the staff came out with a surprise birthday cake for my husband and sang to him. Sometimes it's the small gestures that mean the most and I can't thank them enough for their kindness and attention to detail. We will most certainly be using this hotel again on our next visit and can highly recommend it to anyone. Thank you for a thoroughly enjoyable and relaxing weekend.",5,2017,03,14
115,Stunning,"Beautiful hotel, the staff were second to none- incredibly helpful and obliging and it was a superb location. The breakfast was also fantastic and we could not fault it. We stayed in the deluxe suite which was spacious and clean. We will definitely return! ",5,2017,03,13
115,Our second stay and not our last,We knew right away to book at The Bloomsbury when we returned to London again for three nights. The only thing I can add to my previous review was the excellent service from Camille and the general sense of warmth and comfort we felt when we strolled back to the hotel from a night out in Soho or Covent Garden. It's very centrally located and just feels like our home in London.,5,2017,03,13
115,Theatre stay,Stayed here on Saturday 11th March . Really nice welcoming hotel with very friendly approachable staff. Rooms are generous and by the looks of it slowly being decorated. Paid for breakfast in the morning  which was an excellent buffet style breakfast. Booked it as we were going to the Adelphi theatre to see kinky boots. Booking site said .4 of a mile away but reckon it's more like .75 miles away. Would definitely stay there again though,4,2017,03,13
115,"Beautiful Hotel, ideal location",Loved this hotel for a weekend stay with friends.  Very close to bars and restaurants so no need for taxis or public transport when heading out in the evening.  We were pleasantly surprised with the size of the room.  Would definitely return.,5,2017,03,12
115,"Great hotel, fantastic staff!","We stayed at the hotel for 1 night over the weekend and were not disappointed at all. We expected the hotel to be lovely and be of a 5 star standard but what sets it above the competition is the service provided by every staff member you come in contact with. This starts at check in and continues throughout the stay from housekeeping, restaurant/bar and concierge staff. We were always greeted with a smile and a genuine desire to ensure that we were enjoying our stay. The hard product of a hotel is often comparable with other establishments but it's the customer service that will raise it above the competition....well done The Bloomsbury, you achieved it! Will be back and will thoroughly recommend it to friends and colleagues! ",5,2017,03,12
115,Dissapointing,"The hotel is situated in a very good location. We opted to upgrade our room, which was quite nice - a decent sized bathroom and very comfortable bed. However, we were unaware when booking that the hotel is undergoing some refurbishment works which meant that we had no natural light entering the room due to scaffolding along the side of the building. I expected more for £220 per night. Then again, it is London, right?

The Bloomsbury club bar is nice, however nowhere near enough staff. There was one guy running around taking orders, and another making drinks. I think it took around 20 minutes to get a drink, at which point - I was pretty fed up. 

I ordered a pizza through the 24 hour room service, which took around an hour to arrive and was honestly putrid. 

Now for the real stinker, my partner unfortunately left her hair straighteners behind. Yes, understood it is our fault. However, I contacted them around 4 hours after check out to tell them. Obviously they would still be in the room at this point. They told me that they would investigate with the girl that cleaned our room. Following day, I get a call from Sebastian (The hotel manager) - ""It's likely that the girl who cleaned your room threw them away"" Sorry!? Thrown away a pair of £200 hair straighteners. OK...

Harry Potter at the Palace was good at least!",2,2017,03,10
115,A Hygge experience,"We stayed here for three nights bed and breakfast last week , three of us in two rooms on the seventh floor, one room upgraded to a slightly larger one.

We like this area of central London for its convenience and this hotel is in the perfect place, near Tottenham Court Road tube, five minutes walk to Oxford Street and ten minutes to Covent Garden...perfect.  What a great choice this hotel proved to be, it was just so lovely to return after a long day out to find all the public areas drenched in candle light.  It was such a relaxing place to stay, definitely a hygge experience.

The rooms were really clean and well decorated with lovely comfortable beds, crisp bedding and lovely pillows.  Tea/coffee/biscuits and a coffee making machine and a mini bar were included.  

We had breakfast included and this was in the ground floor restaurant.  A cold buffet where you helped yourself and hot food could be ordered at the table and was freshly cooked and delicious.  Hot drinks and fruit juices were served at the table.  All ingredients were top quality.

There was a very interesting little book left in our room for us to read about the history of the building which we thoroughly enjoyed reading.  It was once the YWCA and was built on the land of an old fairground.  Over the years it has been altered but many of the original features remain such as the iron work balustrades on the staircases, doors ,windows ans some furniture. There is also a poet in residence!

I would certainly recommend this hotel for its location, comfort , architecture and history.  The staff were always available and we never had to queue or wait for anything all the time we were there. Certainly hope to visit again sometime.",5,2017,03,08
115,"great hotel, great location","this is a very good hotel very near to totnam court road sub (100 m') and very near to oxford street.
the hotel is beautiful but the room are bit small.
the room is very clean and the bathroom  is very good ",5,2017,03,08
115,Definitely worth it,A very conveniently situated hotel for central London. But there's more to it than that. Either the staff are excellently trained or they are well selected - perhaps both! Their welcome and care was excellent. Room was not large but very clean.  Only slight improvement would have been a walk in shower rather than a bath to climb into for a shower. Would definitely go again.,5,2017,03,07
115,Brilliant,"We stayed here for my partners birthday and had the superior queen room on the top floor. The room itself wasn't massive but the bed was really comfortable and we both slept well, the bathroom was very small and could only fit one at a time. The service here is amazing and breakfast was delicious ! We were made to feel like royalty, amazing services in the room as well. ",4,2017,03,06
115,Our little London Gem,"We had a lovely night at The Bloomsbury whilst visiting friends in the city. Beautiful well maintained hotel with excellent customer service. We arrived around 10ish not expecting to be able to check in but just to leave our bags but the receptionist was able to check us in early and also offered an upgrade! When we said we had twin four year olds at home they bought up two teddy bears and the cutest 'do not disturb - super mum sleeping' door sign! Service was excellent, great location near to Oxford Street, Soho and the West End. Still a fairly quiet area set back from the main street. We went out in the Goodge street area in the evening and was only a 5 minute walk away. We also tried the bar in the hotel which was a treat, very art-deco/retro feel. We can't comment on the breakfast as we ate out but menu looked decent. 
We would definitely recommend the hotel for a central London break and will be sure to stay here again if we can get another child free weekend!",5,2017,03,06
115,Not good enough,"The hotel is going through some building work resulting in a £170 per night room with no natural light and no view except for scaffolding and ladders.And I was told this was an upgrade!
Breakfast was of a poor quality with cold food/plates, lumpy eggs and a oil/water phase covering the bacon",2,2017,03,06
115,High Quality near the tube,"Spent two nights at this splendid hotel where the staff was friendly and helpful, the room was cosy and the bed excellent. The Tottenham Court Road Tube Station is easily reachable. I can highly recommend The Bloomsbury.",5,2017,03,01
115,EXCEPTIONAL STAFF & CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Stayed for two nights.  Loved the hotel and the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful - all remembering your name, which is a nice touch.  They made our stay extremely comfortable and enjoyable.  Would definitely stay here again but next time would pay a little extra for a superior room as our only criticism is that the standard rooms and beds were a little on the small side!",5,2017,02,28
115,Lovely hotel in great location,"Lovely historic hotel for our family visit, we stayed at the the Bloomsbury 3 nights in 2 double rooms.  Location close to Tottenham Court Road underground made our travelling within London very easy and it was a delight coming back to the hotel in the evening!  Very clean and wonderful service by all the staff. Breakfasts served by Estelita and her friendly and efficient colleagues was fantastic and we were even served full breakfast by room service at 06.40 am our last morning so we could be all set for our taxi at 7 am in as relaxed manner as possible!  We plan and hope to stay at the Bloomsbury again next time we return to London.",5,2017,02,27
115,"Great hotel, location and experience","The location is superb, based one street north of Oxford Street just off the junction with Tottenham Court Road. For a night out in town or for shopping, this is simply perfect.

On arrival you get a warm welcome within the art decor styled reception area. The hotel itself is smart, chic and unpretentious. The interior of the hotel is to a high standard. The concierge was very helpful as were the check-in team. The hotel staff really were delightful.

The room was located near the end of the corridor on the top floor. It was well laid out, decorated nicely and was very well presented. There were two velox style windows that provided a roof top view towards the BT tower. The bathroom was smart but pretty basic with a shower positioned above the bath. The air conditioning worked well in the room keeping it at quite a comfortable temperature. We were not disturbed by any noise during our stay. 

The basement bar was nice but service was very slow at 7pm. Maybe we just caught them at a bad time as other reviews praise the bar highly. 

Breakfast was really very good. A buffet including continental and cooked breakfast with eggs cooked to order. 

We booked the stay in advance online and received a modest price reduction as a result. Checkout was quick and simple.

All in,  this was a great hotel for a night out in London. By London prices , it was good value for money given the high standard of the overall experience. 

We'll happily stay at this hotel again.",5,2017,02,26
115,Attention to detail,"The Bloomsbury is part of the Doyle Collection which includes lovely hotels like The Kensington in South Kensington, where I have had the pleasure of having the best risotto primaverain a while. But back to the Bloomsbury, lovely property, a combination of old world charm and modern efficiency, couple of blocks away from the Plunder, I mean the British Museum and SOHO with it's restaurants and bars. It is also walking distance to the Tottenham Court tube station. The Rooms are quite spacious (for Europe), bathrooms are modern with a bathtub and separate shower. Staff are helpful and friendly. Gabriella at the front desk and Miguel at the door were great. The food, that is where I have mixed feelings, the full English Breakfast at 18 GBP per person was a disaster, not only was it expensive, the eggs were overdone and no baked beans were included. The breakfast buffet was good, our server Georgi was very accommodating. Now interestingly, room service food was pretty decent. Our last night I had the super food salad and my daughter had a lovely vegetarian pizza. Overall, I would recommend this hotel if you were needed to stay around the area, but on my next trip I will try the Kensington Hotel.",4,2017,02,25
115,I contacted the concierge by email and got answers!,"I contacted Brian Murphy and his staff (the concierge two years ago) by email and arranged trips to Wimbledon, Highcleare Castle (for Downton Abbey on public television) and Bath!  He and his staff were extremely helpful.  I emailed him because I was in the United States.  The food at The Bloomsbury was the best!!!  The room was great and we couldn't have asked for anything better.",5,2017,02,25
115,nearly like home,"very friendly and stylish hotel. you feel nearly like home. excellent breakfast with nice staff. extremely good bar downstairs. rooms can be little small, but high standard of comfort. rooms always perfect cleaned. consierge service very helpful",5,2017,02,25
115,Excellent location for London break,"Just around the corner from tube station, walking distance from Theatre, Covent Garden and British Museum, this was the perfect location for a weeknd in London. Excellent facilities at the hotel. Would definitely stay there again.  ",5,2017,02,23
115,Excellent Hotel,We felt that The Bloomsbury was very reasonably priced considering how luxurious and well positioned it is. The staff we very friendly and our room was spacious and spotlessly clean. The services in the room were good and we had a very comfortable night. ,5,2017,02,22
115,I wish I could live at this hotel!!,Beautiful hotel and lovely room. They made my daughters (10 & 12) feel very welcome with a thoughtful note to them on arrival to our room!  The breakfast was amazing too. Great location. We will be back!! ,5,2017,02,22
115,Above and beyond,"I proposed to my girlfriend on that trip to London and the Bloomsbury really helped make it the best day of our lives. Julia Falz was the one that helped organize the special extra, but everything was great. We only used the hotel room so I can't speak for the other facilities, but there was a lot of them.",5,2017,02,21
115,Swanky,The hotel staff are lovely and attentive . Very welcoming and had hot towels on arrival . The 1920s Art Deco bar is a must see . Room was nice -view of nothing but a wall although we were kindly offered a upgrade but as didn't have a bath we opted against . Loved our stay however we had hairs in our bath on arrival -when we rang the cleaner re cleaned  the bath but there were still hairs so this bugged us both,3,2017,02,21
115,"Great hotel, very tasteful and in a lovely location","We spent two days at the hotel, the room was tastefully decorated with a really nice bathroom, nice toiletries!

The food was excellent.

The Bloomsbury Club bar is really nice with a lot of different drinks on offer and friendly staff.  Very busy though.

The Dalloway Terrace is under refurbishment and should be really nice when finished.

The hotel looks lovely in the evening with candles everywhere - lovely atmosphere.

The staff were really professional and friendly.

Great location, the British Museum is a short walk.

Highly recommend a visit!",5,2017,02,20
115,Wonderful visit,"I like to keep reviews simple and relatable so I'll keep it short: Staff was most helpful (they switched out room to accommodate my pregnant wife without hesitation) and, most importantly, the bath towels are amazing. Every bath towel should be so big :)  It's the little things that matter.  ",5,2017,02,20
115,Bloomsburry experience,"I have been a guest at the fashion show by jasper gavida in Bloomsburry hotel, after the show was finish I decided to have a drink at the bar because sacred place where the Bloomsburry group, including Virginia Wolf, used to reunite influencing arts and literature of the 20th century. Astonish atmosphere with great customer service, waiters always professional and helpful with recommendation. Many thanks to the bar tender that made for me a wonderful rum old fashioned, my friends try some delicious fancy cocktails. The bills was not expensive as I was expecting, I strongly recommend to have a look at the bar for historic reason and have a drink at the same time for the large and original selection of cocktails provide.",5,2017,02,20
115,Amazing Place.,"I did a last minute booking , when I arrived there was a little bit of trouble finding my booking as it was slow to process, because of the short delay with reception finding it, they decided to upgraded me to a junior suite. It was amazing! , heated floors in the luxurious bathroom ,(that had a television at the end of the bath!) large bed , good pillows crisp clean sheets , squidgy chairs to relax in . Dressing room stocked bar/coffee machine /white fluffy dressing gowns and slippers. Very clean . the whole hotel was a very high standard in decor and cleanliness.   Quiet at night and a really good night sleep. . The room was 801. Breakfast was out of this world with plenty of choice and as checkout was not till 12 I was able to return to the room and relax for a bit longer  . The staff were so polite and helpful and nothing was too much trouble  . I can totally recommend this hotel . it was a dream . I will always go back here .",5,2017,02,19
115,wonderful place,"Wonderful place. One of the nicest hotels ever.

Room so nice, breakfast so nice, wonderful location what else can I say.

Staff were friendly and so helpful would love to come back our stay was perfect.",5,2017,02,19
115,Finally: a good hotel in London,"Having visited London countless times and tried various hotels (most of which turned out to be pretty mediocre despite their prices), I was pleasantly surprised by the standards at The Bloomsbury. Customer service is top-notch and amenities are excellent. Password-free WiFi access with good reception was a big plus for me. The breakfast manager (I believe her name was Maria) was outstanding, the choice was extensive and the food was excellent. Finally, a London hotel I'd be very happy to stay at again!",5,2017,02,19
115,Valentine's visit,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights over Valentine's day. Hotel is beautiful, every member of staff we had contact with were polite, courteous and nothing was too much trouble. Room was upgraded which was very nice, clean and comfortable. Breakfast was delicious and plenty of variety. The two roses left in our room on Valentine's day was a lovely touch. We took in Motown the musical and sleeping beauty ballet at royal opera house during our stay and the location of hotel was perfect for both theatres. We had drinks in the bar before retiring for the evening and were well looked after by Demis who was chatty without being intrusive. All in all a fabulous stay and can't wait for the opportunity to return :)",5,2017,02,16
115,Lovely stay,"We had a lovely 3 night stay and really enjoyed the hotel, there is a really comfortable vibe to the hotel and the staff are excellent.  We had afternoon tea one day and would recomend any one trying this as it was really enjoyable.  The only slightly negatives we found were that the standard room was a little smaller than we are used to but was still comfortable, and there was little natural light in the room we had, however this would not put us off staying again and we look forward to booking in again soon.",4,2017,02,16
115,First trip to London,"Right from getting out of the taxi the service was second to none.

All the staff are very polite and friendly and couldnt do more to help you.

A special mention must go to Demis in the bar for his friendliness and service.

A happy birthday song and little cakes with breakfast and a glass of fizz with breakfast on valentines day. 

A birthday cake and card was left in the room as well.

Valentines rose delivered to each room as well was a nice touch.

Only downside was on leaving we asked for a taxi and had to wait nearly 20 minutes (the conciege was walking up and down the road looking for one !  not a good impression)
",5,2017,02,16
115,Another fantastic stay ,Yet again another fantastic stay at this wonderful hotel stay here twice a year as such nice rooms and freindly staff this time went to the Bar for cocktails the barmen Sebastian knows his cocktails made them I'm front of us you can have afternoon tea here also which we might have on next visit in all this is a must visit and stay and as it's in great Russell Street great location as 2min walk to top of Oxford Street Tottenham Court Road tube station also here so easy to get around back again in November also would like to thank Sebastian Annandale for all his help while here last time ,5,2017,02,15
115,A lovely experience. A good place to stay.,"The Bloomsbury is a great find. It is a beautiful building, very comfortable and a feeling of being hospitable. The staff are just lovely without trying too hard. I think we will make this our first port of call in future. A good compromise between Premier Inn and  paying a lot more. A winner.",4,2017,02,14
115,Impeccable service and great hotle ,"My husband took me away for valentines weekend . All thought out by him we arrived at the Bloomsbury and was impressed straight away with the look the smell the polite staff . Nothing was to much everyone was really happy to help . We stayed for 1 night the room was well stocked with refreshments and sundries. We ate in the restaurant the waiter and food was smashing. They new everything about the menue , they kept your glass top up    And was on the ball all the time . Breakfast was jut as good experience . The staff greeted you with a friendly smile and always used your name Throughout the dining . They didn't serve beans at breakfast I asked for some and this wasn't a problem a hot bowl of beans was brought to the table within 5 mins . Would I stay her again yes yes yes ",5,2017,02,13
115,Lovely stay,"Our first impression at check in was very good.easy and quick check in and friendly member of staff.
We were upgraded which is always a plus.our room was very clean and perfectly adequate in size.
The room was very quiet so much so we overslept which has never happened before.
The only drawback was when we got back from show and meal the bar was closed for a private function.This was a shame as the bar looked lovely and we were looking forward to a couple of cocktails before turning in.we had our drinks in the foyer area which was still a relaxing experience.
All in all a very pleasant stay.",4,2017,02,13
115,Afternoon Tea - Amazing food and amazing staff again,"Booked an afternoon tea here for me and my partner, at the last minute our babysitter let us down! :-( so we took our 2 yr daughter with us, the hotel was amazing, all the staff were amazing to her/ very friendly the reception lady even gave her a santa teddy with the Bloomsbury hotel written on it, which she loves. The afternoon tea was lush too. Definitely recommend this hotel for any type of visit, the Staff here make it all the more special. I will be back again and again and again.....",5,2017,02,13
115,"Great hotel, cozy rooms","I started using this hotel as a back up to sister hotel The Marylebone. Today, I prefer it to the Marylebone, rooms are more spacious, more personal service, better breakfast, and chinese Michelin star restaurant Hakkasan is just 5' walking.",4,2017,02,10
115,Excellent!,"I stayed at the Bloomsbury recently for a conference and was very impressed with my time there. Everything about the hotel was delivered and presented at a very high standard, and they put a lot of effort into finer details that other hotels ignore (eg. a personal, signed welcome letter from the manager dated for my check-in date). The facilities are very well kept and the staff was extremely helpful, delivering my printed boarding pass along with a cup of coffee to my door at the exact time of my wake-up call. I'd definitely recommend staying here!",5,2017,02,10
115,Great place to stay in London,"We enjoyed our stay at Bloomsbury. Comfortable, clean, and quiet. Staff is service oriented. Nice extras such as turndown service, Nespresso coffee maker, complimentary morning newspaper. Excellent location very near Tottenham Court Road Tube stop. ",5,2017,02,09
115,Slow Internet Speed and old gym machines,"I wish the room wifi speed is as good as other American chain hotels as they were very slow (I checked the speed with my phone apps multiple times) and the gym machines need to be maintained as they were not functioning some.   Other than these two issues, restaurant and rooms were good except I wish they have better lighting system on desk as it was too dark",3,2017,02,09
115,Perfect hotel and location,"We stayed here as part of a birthday celebration for my partner. The hotel is situated close  to the theatre for a show we planned to see and is a perfect location for shopping very close to oxford circus tube station.

Check in was quick and simple with luggage automatically taken to our room. The service overall was excellent with staff very accomodating. The hotel is beautifully decorated and palatial  The room we stayed in was on the small side but was adequate with nice furnishings and all amenities you would expect Inc mini bar, trouser press, tv, air con etc. There is a good restaurant on site with a lovely bar area for afternoon tea or pre-dinner drinks.

We had room service for breakfast which was excellent quality and ample in quantity and well worth staying for the breakfast alone.

There are much cheaper alternatives but if you are looking for a touch of luxury without breaking the bank and a good location for your visit to London this is the place to stay. I will certainly be planning to return!",5,2017,02,08
115,A wonderful stay as always,"Perfect hotel in a great location with friendly and attentive staff.  Rooms clean and comfortable as always. Lovely cocktails and fabulous breakfasts. 
Candle-lit everywhere at night creating a wonderful atmosphere.
Our favourite place to stay.",5,2017,02,07
115,Am having a bad experience...,"Very nice lobby indeed, but I don't sleep in the lobby...
Very noisy rooms, you can hear the people next door sniffing!, no ventilation in the bathroom (or it doesn't work, which is the same), very small rooms, and I must stay here till friday... only 4 more nights to go... Wish me luck!",3,2017,02,06
115,Great London break,"Second time at the Bloomsbury and it did not disappoint. From our arrival,check in to leaving Friday to Monday could not fault anything. Our superior double room was immaculate,the food service and care at breakfast was excellent. The location suits us too being near to oxford street and Tottenham court tube.already planning a return trip in the autumn.",5,2017,02,06
115,Centrally situated theater break package,"By accident my wife found this hotel including breakfast and a theater break. We could not have wished for a better hotel. Ideally located for all of central London, easy to find from the underground and first class service from the moment we arrived. The standard was easily 4 star, the staff were friendly and welcoming and our room was extremely comfortable and warm. The towels were very soft unlike some locations where the lack of fabric conditioner makes them feel like sandpaper. One very minor criticism was the cup was not washed properly and traces of lipstick were visible, but I am not helpless and washed it myself. The breakfast which was included was very nice, with the staff catering for our needs. Plenty of choice and we both now wish we had dined at the hotel instead of venturing out into the manic restaurants of central London on the Saturday evening prior to the show. At check out on the Sunday the reception was busy, but what a surprise when instead of having to wait, a young lady stopped working on a PC to accept our checkout. We will definitely look to book with this hotel again on our next visit to London. Don't be put off by perception of an over the top, expensive hotel as the price we paid for a theater package with breakfast made this a very competitive option.",5,2017,02,06
115,"Thoughtful, Friendly, Posh Hotel","First, it has A LIBRARY. Hundreds of books in a 1930's comfortable room with chairs and lamps. Heaven. The original swimming pool may someday be restored, as well ,making it the perfect hotel in my world.

Easy walk to all West End theatres, great food, friendly staff, very professional, GREAT BREAKFAST that you should definitely pay to have come with the room. HEALTHY pressed juice bar, SEXY terrace dining.",5,2017,02,06
115,Special hotel!,"We have visited London many times but have never experienced such a welcoming, comfortable hotel in a fab location.  The staff went above and beyond to make sure everything was good for us.  The hotel is luxurious but not over the top.  Cant rate the customer service high enough, will definitely book there again.",5,2017,02,06
115,Very special,"As a special birthday treat we stayed at The Bloomsbury Hotel and had a wonderful time. We stayed in a beautiful spacious room, it was so well designed with many stylish special touches, and excellent service.
This is a fascinating historic building, with many interesting features - the entrance lobby is very impressive and the Cocktail Bar is great - we probably spent a bit too much time there! 
It is in the heart of stylish Bloomsbury, close to The British Museum and Oxford Street. The only issue would be if you drive, as the one-way streets are a nightmare to negotiate",5,2017,02,06
115,Theatre Trip,"Second stay at The Bloomsbury for a theatre trip - did not disappoint.  Everything about this hotel was great from the location, staff, comfort and cleanliness. Will hopefully get the chance to return again.",5,2017,02,06
115,Theatre Trip,Picked this hotel for a one night stay for it's convenient location to the Phoenix Theatre and were not disappointed. We had a double room superior which was not huge but everything was clean and in good order. We came back from the Theatre to a tuck down service which was lovely. Fab breakfast in the morning with lovely attentive staff.,5,2017,02,04
115,1 Night Stay,"Beautiful Hotel. Busy area of London but it's located off the main track & was quiet & very comfortable. Staff are really attentive, I only had breakfast which was delicious. Lovely Bar / Terrace area. ",5,2017,02,03
115,A lovely birthday treat,"It was the first birthday my boyfriend had had since we got together and I thought we deserved a treat.  It was his birthday the following Monday and we also had tickets for the theatre on the Saturday so decided to make a weekend of it, and what a treat we had!

My boyfriend had been a little apprehensive when we left Tottenham Court Road Tube and all around was busyness, people, cars, hustle and bustle, but when we turned the corner into Great Russell Street he had a wonderful surprise when I pointed out 
The Bloomsbury just down the road in its own little oasis.
On arrival, at reception, we were offered hot damp towels for our hands to freshen up which set the tone of how were treated for the rest of our stay.

We had booked into a king room, that didn't disappoint, the decor was luxurious and felt very comfortable.  There was a huge mirror on one wall, the full size of the wall, which made it feel even more spacious. 

Before we left reception we were offered a discount on breakfast in the restaurant, the offer that day was full English Breakfast for the price of a continental.  We left reception and mulled it over since we'd booked into another restaurant but with the offer given to us it didn't take much to cancel our booking and book into The Bloomsbury for breakfast, we could spend more time lazing and enjoying the hotel the following morning.

I was everso impressed when I called reception and my call was answered by name - it's the little things isn't it...

I had mentioned in the booking information it was my boyfriend's birthday and could they do something in the room, not too much fuss, to mark it.  When we walked in we found a lovely cake on a plate in lovely cellophane wrapping with ""Happy Birthday"" iced in chocolate on the plate and a card hand written too.  What a lovely touch.
We had tickets for the Theatre Royal at the Haymarket so set off there, being wished a good evening en route by the staff.

After the performance and a brief stop in Soho for noodles en route to the hotel we headed down to the cocktail bar in The Bloomsbury.  It's a sumptuously wood clad bar area, in the basement, where you take a seat after ordering and your cocktails are brought to you.

We had a couple of cocktails, my boyfriend's favourite, Espresso Martini really hit the spot.  They cocktails were accompanied by fresh olives and a glass of water each.  We were very well looked after, the staff are very attentive but not intrusive.  There was a mistake on the bill but they quickly resolved it and were very apologetic.
We had received another offer too - we had discount on the cocktails too.  I can't remember the exact discount but it was sizeable and rounded the night off nicely!

The bed was very comfy to sleep in and the room was very quiet, allowing us to sleep in (although the walls are thin so early morning exploits could be heard from next door quite clearly, still they were obviously indulging in a treat too!) It didn't disturb us though.

After a lovely lie-in, a rarity!, we headed down to the restaurant for breakfast.  There was a buffet of cold food (meats, cheese, yoghurts, fruit juice, pastries etc) where you could help yourself and the staff take your order for hot food.  There is quite a choice of hot foods cooked to order and the bacon was to die for, it melted in your mouth.  Of course the rest of the hot food was delicious too but I can still taste the bacon when I think back now.

We weren't rushed through our meal and finished around 11:30, heading back to our room to pack.  We had express check out which we took advantage of.

We used the stairs going up and down to our room on the fifth floor to take in the architectural features of the floors and also enjoyed taking in the details as we moved around the hotel.  There is plenty to take in, one of the reasons I booked us in there since one of my boyfriend's passions is architecture and he wasn't disappointed.

We were sorry to leave the hotel when we checked out since it had been such a lovely experience but we have promised ourselves we will return - it's definitely a special hotel for treats and celebrations!

The surrounding area is rich in architecture and history and worth walking through rather than heading for to the tube.

We will most definitely return, we would also like to try other hotels in the Doyle Collection - they look rather good too!

Thanks to the staff in The Bloomsbury for making it such a special stay",5,2017,02,01
115,Superb Hotel,"A two night stay in late December to catch up with friends and see a show. Excellent location for Theatreland, Oxford Street etc.
1.Service.
From the moment you arrive the first thing you realise is that you are actually going to get superb service - something that's increasingly rare these days. You really can't fault the staff here who go ""above and beyond' to make you feel welcome. Nothing is too much trouble. 
2. Room
Our rooms were of a good size, clean and with great amenities - mini bar, safe, tea, kettle and a nice touch was the Nesspresso machine! Nice big double bed and lots of wardrobe space, decor is in ""Arts and crafts"" style in keeping with hotel architecture. (A slight minus point later though)
3.Food. We didn't eat dinner in the hotel but would highly recommend the breakfast.There is an excellent ""help yourself"" buffet but the ""cooked to order"" fare is really very good. Your order is cooked at the time for you and not just picked out of a pot that has been kept warm for hours while everything goes soggy. These people actually know how to deliver a perfect poached egg! I should also mention the staff who go out of their way to provide you with excellent service.The lady in charge (Maria?) was particularly good.
4. The Minus? Well, we were originally booked into a room on the seventh floor adjacent to the lift (Rm702?) and unfortunately the floor above is wood - not concrete like the rest of the floors - and part of a corridor. It was therefore a noisy night.
On mentioning this to reception they were hugely apologetic and we were immediately moved to a different room on floor 6 which was excellent. We were even offered a complimentary glass of wine which we enjoyed in the bar that evening.
Problems will always happen in the best run hotels - what sets the place apart is how they are dealt with.
Would not hesitate to stay there again.",5,2017,02,01
115,Excellent.,"Everything about this hotel is good; the location, the staff, the breakfast, and the room. It is close to the British Museum and if you are a walker, Picadilly, Soho, and the gay area, including Chinatown, are within walking distance.",5,2017,01,31
115,Bloomsbury Terrace - beautiful luxury experience,"Three of use enjoyed a post theatre meal on the terrace during Christmas 2016. The décor was very festive and with plenty of heating, with additional option of blankets and hot water bottles. Nothing too much trouble for the staff.
Not cheap, but considering the location and level of service I'd consider it reasonable value.",5,2017,01,31
115,"Lovely hotel, a real find","It's a shame I only got to spend one night here. It's a lovely hotel, room was very clean and comfortable and the manager had left a welcome card and a complimentary selection of freshly prepared fruit, which was a nice touch.  Great location. ",5,2017,01,30
115,Great hotel,"Elegant hotel in London with a magnificent reception and customer service. Breakfast provides options, and you can ask anything you like. My room was a bit small but very elegant. The location is fantastic: it is between Tottenham-court-road and Holborn tube station, so everything is walking distance. It is just a few yards aways from Oxford Circus, Covent-garden, etc..  I will go back for sure",5,2017,01,30
115,"Excellent staff, rooms and location!","What a great hotel! The rooms are beautiful decorated, spacious and clean. 
The location could not be better and it is on a quiet street, which makes for a great night sleep.
Make sure you take your time to have breakfast, because it was delicious. 

And to top it all off, the staff is excellent!

Will definitely come back!",5,2017,01,30
115,Perfect London Location with lots of charmh,"There are lots of things in walking distance of this gem, theater, restaurants, the British Museum, etc.  The Bloomsbury is filled with interesting history itself!  Well appointed rooms.  Cozier in size than American top notch hotels.  
A great value for London.",4,2017,01,29
115,Just Fabulous,"This is a beautiful and elegant hotel. From the moment you approach the front door you are treated like Royalty. The rooms a very well appointed and the dinner in the new terrace was exquisite. We dined on 8 of the lite bites and out#r compliments go to the chef. Stunning fare. The breakfast the next morning is very good with hot dishes cooked to order.
This remains one of our favourite hotels in London.",5,2017,01,29
115,Amazing...,"My thanks go out to the staff who I had the pleasure of meeting during my two night stay.... firstly to Sebastian and Andre who dealt with my requests with ease... To Brian and Ivan for their constant smiling and friendly service... lastly to Camille... You found me a DVD player when there wasn't one and smiled all time time. 

Great service! 

We will be back!! 

Thank you ",5,2017,01,29
115,"Theft in my room, little management reaction","Was at The Bloomsbury for 5 nights when some of my personal property was stolen from my room on the evening before my departure.  When checking out in the morning I reported it both to the front desk and to the client service desk.  They promised a quick investigation and said they would contact me with the results.  I could not file a police complaint as I was heading to the airport immediately.  After several weeks I received no response from the hotel; no outcome of the investigation was provided.  It's a classy nice hotel in a great neighborhood; excellent breakfast, lovely holiday decorations, but should have much more professional service for the price paid.  Disappointing.",3,2017,01,28
115,Exceptional hotel,"Exceptional welcome, room, staff,food and ambiance. Ideally located for leicester sq, tottenham court road, soho and chinatown. Good value for money considering location and overall standard of hotel.",5,2017,01,28
115,Snazzy spot! ,Great whisky lounge downstairs . The selection is extensive and the staff very attentive. Great place to go on a date! Restaurant upstairs was nice good food and setting. Venison loin and white chicken were very nice . Priced relatively reasonable . ,4,2017,01,28
115,Heading back to The Bloomsbury in February,"Can't wait. The Bloomsbury really takes the edge off business trips. Comfortable rooms, excellent staff, warm and cozy. Last time I visited The Bloomsbury I lost my wallet. The duty manager searched my room and found it!  Great service!",5,2017,01,27
115,Dreary and overpriced,"The location is superb. But ... the room was rather small, not well-lighted and colorless. Even the windows lack curtains! There was only one small drawer in the closet.
The lobby is opulent but very dim.
There were problems with breakfast: too many uncoordinated staff so by the time the eggs come, the toast is cold, or conversely.
I guess aristocrats would like this expensive hotel for its ""atmosphere,"" but I much prefer an unpretentious business hotel with a comfortable room and a decent breakfast buffet.",3,2017,01,27
115,Great location - wonderful staff,"great location and loved the hotel overall - old style decor. Large room. The rooms are a bit dark, though, and I couldn't figure out the AC/Heat - even with the manual. 

breakfast should be included though - especially since I stayed for 9 nights.
I'll definitely stay there again. ",4,2017,01,26
115,Week in London to visit the British Museum and see the sights!,"After reading ""The History of the World in 100 Objects"" we thought it would be fun to spend a few days, instead of just a few hours, at The British Museum.  The Bloomsbury was the perfect spot, basically across the street from the Museum.  It's quiet, classy, and easy walking distance to other sights too.  We went to theatre, several other museums and a few Churches and we were able to come back to the room to re-charge between our morning and afternoon itinerary every day. The rooms are smallish, but well-designed, with plenty of amenities to make you comfortable. The staff were knowledgeable and very helpful. They even provide umbrellas!  Luckily for us, however, there was no need since we had no rain the entire week.",5,2017,01,26
115,My Second Stay Was As Good As The First,"I stayed at The Bloomsbury last May and returned for Christmas with my son this past December. While the staff was small due to the holiday season, the service was excellent. 

Our room was very nice. We asked for a tub and they moved a king-sized bed out and two twins into a wonderful room to satisfy our request. Don't expect a giant room. This is London. Like New York, and Tokyo, space is limited. But we didn't spend much time in the room because we were too busy seeing the sights. No complaints at all.

We received a complimentary cheese platter served in the bar downstairs. The bar is gorgeous. I'm a designer and have some new ideas. 

The hotel is in a great location. The British Museum is right down the street. The Tottenham Court Rd tube stop is a very short walk away. Soon the new line out to Heathrow will open there. There's a pharmacy and a Sainsbury's right around the corner if you want to stock up on snacks and water.

The staff answered all our questions and were terrific. I'll be staying at The Bloomsbury again - I hope soon!",4,2017,01,25
115,A lovely hotel,"This hotel is a real gem. If you want to stay in theatre land and be near the British Museum this has to be the place. Luxurious lobby, beautifully and tastefully appointed (if not slightly compact) room that had the best power/internet communications panel above the desk that I have ever seen in a hotel, so it’s ideal for business too.
The service is impeccable; personal attention at check-in and check-out. They strive to make their guests feel special. This says a lot for the market positioning strategy and staff training for this small chain.
The breakfasts comprise a la carte or buffet. Both options are very good with plenty of choice. On a previous occasion, I had afternoon tea in the lobby which was also a pleasant experience; very civilised.
After an evening at the theatre we discovered the Bloomsbury Club Bar situated downstairs. A couple of glasses of wine in this warm ambiance rounded off a great day.
The hotel doesn’t have a carpark. The nearest is the Tottenham Court Road underground carpark (two minutes’ walk) provided that you are unconcerned about your alloy wheels and are confident navigating acute corners, high kerbs and long narrow ramps.",5,2017,01,25
115,Classy hotel,"Took my wife here on a romantic trip just after New Year, and was very happy with everything. Friendly helpful staff, nice clean rooms, and the whole ambience was relaxed. The decor is stylish, art deco inspired, and the location was great - right in the heart of London. Will def.stay again.",5,2017,01,25
115,Superb hotel.,"I have just spent the weekend at The Bloomsbury Hotel and have to say it was a joy from start to finish. In my experience many London hotels can be soulless, and one often feels that your custom is taken for granted. Not so The Bloomsbury. From the moment I arrived, I was made to feel special and, more importantly, welcome. 
Each and every member of staff from reception right through to housekeeping always greeted me with a friendly smile. Unfortunately I didn't have the time to make use of the many facilities, but my breakfast experience on both days was superb. Again, both friendly and welcoming staff, an extensive range of goodies on the buffet, and the best Full English Breakfast I've had for a long, long time! I didn't need to eat again until the evening! 
My bedroom was lovely. Very stylish, extremely comfortable chair for slobbing in front of the TV and a well lit desk to work at. The thing however that impressed me most was the heated floor tiles in the bathroom. Now that is class!!
Many thanks to everyone there for a wonderful stay. I know where I'll be staying next time I'm in London!",5,2017,01,24
115,The Best Birthday Stay,"My boyfriend arranged a surprise night here for my birthday. Upon arrival we were greeted at the door by Andre. My boyfriend gave his last name and immediately Andre greeted us by name and wished me a happy birthday!! We then checked in to be upgraded to a duluxe room, when entering the room, I was truly surprised by an array of birthday treats, big number balloons, birthday balloons around the bed, champagne on ice, a cake and a card. My boyfriend had been liasing with Andre prior to our arrival but even he was surprised with the effort put in, especially when we arrived back from dinner to find rose petals sprinkled around the room! We had some cocktails in the B club which were fab, the rooms are really lovely, clean, tea and coffee facilities, wifi. The hotel itself is beautiful! We couldn't have enjoyed our stay more! Thank you guys. ",5,2017,01,22
115,Weekend break.,"For our 40th birthdays, my wife and I were given a London theatre break which included a night at the Bloomsbury. Having read the reviews in advance, both of us were looking forward to our stay with some excellent reviews seen. We were not disappointed!!
On arrival at reception, Andre was not only aware of our names but also wished us both a happy birthday and said that we should have some cake during our stay, little did we know at the time that he had put a birthday cake and card in our room ready for us! The whole check in process was more like meeting a friend than a administrative process.
The room itself was small as other reviews state, however, for an overnight stay was OK. The facilities in the room are nice with a very high quality to everything from the toiletries and bathroom to the bed and complimentary tea's and coffee's. This was the first time I had a Nespresso machine for decent coffee in room. The good quality robes and slippers added to the luxury feel of the room. The bed was very comfortable and with the quiet surrounds ensured a peaceful sleep.
At breakfast the next morning, we turned up at the end of the peak period. While a table was arranged we were seated in the bar which was pleasant and hot drinks, juices and pastries were availble while we waited. When seated at the table, the breakfast was very nice with a very good choice of continental buffet and hot food off the menu. Our waitress (Maria) was outstanding and nothing was too much trouble. When my wife asked if it was possible to have honey and fresh lemon with hot water for her cold, Maria not only arranged it in minutes but then asked if she would like another bringing to our room for after breakfast. During conversation, when we mentioned our children, Maria showed we were more than just visitors when she gave us a colouring book and pencils to take home for our youngest. We were over the moon with that, but then (not known to us) made arrangements for a Bloomsbury Hotel teddy bear to be bought to the restaurant for us to give to our 2 year old. This was not only an outstanding bit of customer service but also very touching and appreciated. 
Having stayed in many high end hotels over the years, I can honestly say that the Bloomsbury is in the top 2. The customer service throughout is exceptional, with particular mention to Andre and Maria, but even housekeeping were outstanding. Our stay was better than we could ever have hoped and plan to stay again in the future. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is considering staying here.

Thank you to all at the hotel for making our stay perfect and memorable. Surpassing every expectation.",5,2017,01,22
115,"Great setting, relaxed service","Average to Good, 3 as 3.5 is not possible. We popped into the Bloomsbury for coffee and a snack. It has a great location just off Tottenham Court Road, pleasant surroundings, not too busy and very convenient for a one hour meeting. I usually use the lobby for chats and coffee. The service always seems to lack a certain professionalism which would transform this from average to very good. I continue to use it as it is much more convenient than using a coffee or tea shop. ",3,2017,01,22
115,Bloomsbury hotel ,"Fantastic hotel! Booked for a Christmas treat with my daughter and loved our stay here. Just round the corner from the tube and easy walk to theatre. Family friendly, staff great, and lovely atmosphere. Amazing breakfast! Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2017,01,21
115,Fabulous experience,"I travel regularly for business on my own and have stayed all over London. The Bloomsbury is by far the most elegant and beautiful hotel I have stayed in - from the stunning 1920's lobby to the Dalloway Terrace restaurant. It is in a superb location and the staff are wonderfully friendly and helpful, incredibly so, and I adore the attention to detail that continues the theme - the room door signs with quotes from Lewis Carroll and WB Yeats. It was an absolute pleasure - the food is superb and my early morning smoothie from the juice bar just delicious. Thank you Bloomsbury team, I hope to be back soon!",5,2017,01,17
115,Would definitely recommend!,"First, I'll start by saying that I would definitely recommend this hotel - I have stayed here twice with my partner - we loved it the first time and loved it even more the second time!

The staff are very attentive without being overbearing. On our visit last week, my partner briefly mentioned that it was his birthday, and upon return to our room that evening there was a plate of small desserts left with 'happy birthday' written on - a lovely finish to his birthday. 

The hotel is decorated beautifully - very grand but it also has a relaxed and calming atmosphere. On both visits, our rooms have been perfect - the bathrooms are particularly lovely and the Aromatherapy Associates bathroom amenities are amazing! 

The hotel is also in a great location - on a quiet street (which makes for a great nights sleep) but only a few minutes walk from the shops and restaurants of Covent Garden.

I'm almost certain that we will be returning to The Bloomsbury Hotel whenever we visit London. ",5,2017,01,15
115,Perfect,Everything about our stay at the Bloomsbury was perfect. From the great welcome at the door right through to the complimentary bottle of water when we left the whole stay was fantastic. The rooms were perfectly sized with a nice comfy bed. Will definitely be staying here again,5,2017,01,15
115,Good hotel in prime location,"Apart from the room size (tooooo small for 2 people with 4 cases) the hotel, its staff and facilities were  excellent for our 3 night stay. It is a great location in the West End, close to transport and across the road from a fabulous Indian Reastaurant ",5,2017,01,13
115,Best place for company seminars,"We recently held our first 2017 company seminar at this hotel and all I can say is that it was excellent. The staff are friendly and helpful, they put up with our every request with a smile on their face! Bedrooms are beautiful, 5* luxury! Meeting rooms are quirky.
Food was delicious, bar is awesome, such a great vibe! We were extremely happy with this location and will be holding our next seminar there.",5,2017,01,13
115,Very good with several niggles!,"Let me begin by stating the pertinent facts, would I return to The Bloomsbury Hotel? Yes in a heartbeat. Would I recommend this hotel to others? Absolutely 100%.

I chose the Bloomsbury based on its excellent reviews and it's proximity to the theatre we were visiting.

Everything I had read in the reviews was correct, the staff are very friendly and helpful superbly attentive without being overbearing, always a difficult balance. Genuinely caring lovely people from the front door through reception to the restaurant and bar staff they where all wonderful. 

We booked a table at the Dalloway Terrace at the hotel for our pre-theatre meal again wonderful attentive friendly staff and a magical setting with its winter theme. Food was superb my wife had lamb I had the most delicately battered sea bream beautiful fresh and piping hot. 

Breakfast did not dissapoint either, all freshly cooked to order superb quality produce and again piping hot a refreshing change from the current fashion of luke warm buffet breakfasts. 

On our return from the theatre we took the opportunity to visit the cosy cocktail bar and met some more of the wonderful staff and sipped fabulous and very good value cocktails while listening to a superb jazz duo. A magnificent end to the day. 

So why only a rating of 4/5?

I have to admit that I came away from the Bloomsbury a little disappointed. You may think I am just nit picking but when you are pitching your establishment at this level certain things are not acceptable. I hope the hotel managment will read this review and accept it as a honest criticism, I will be returning again and would like to be able to award a high 5. So for now here are the issues that disappointed me. 

I stayed in a double superior room, room number 506 the room initially looked fine please see my actual photographs form my stay however on closer inspection:

1. The room has two velux style skylight windows and although not to be looked through,  they are just for allowing daylight into the room. They were very grubby on the outside (they may not even be reachable from outside) As they were dirty with bird droppings they actually make the room feel a bit grubby which it certainly was not. They may not be able to be cleaned? If that is the case I would make them opaque. 

2. The soft furnishing cushions on the used to dress the bed where frayed and past their best not what I would expect in a hotel of this class. 

3. The room lighting was very temperamental putting the bedside reading light on caused the main room lights to trip off. We called reception and a electrician arrived very quickly. 

He was a really nice guy and did some quick checks confirmed that there was a tripping issue and assured us that it was not a safety issue. 

He asked if we were about to leave for the evening and explained he could stay and strip everything out and repair the issue but it could take a while, or he could schedule it for repair after we had left in the morning. 

We decided as we were only staying one night and we had been shown a work around to keep the lights on that would be okay. Still disappointing that the basiclighting requied a sequence of switches around the room to keep on what you wanted and not what you expect from a hotel of this quality. 

4. On leaving the hotel to visit the theatre I asked at reception if an ice bucket could possibly be taken to my room and the bottle of champagne on the dresser be put into it. I was assured this was not a problem. Unfortunately this request was not followed up and the bottle was still on the dresser quite warm on our return. 

5. Finally my wife asked the waitress in the Dalloway Terrace, who was very polite and charming what was served with the lamb she had ordered? The waitress looked at the menu and replied Broccoli, so my Wife ordered a side order of mashed potatoes. The lamb was actually served on a bed of mashed potatoes! 

So if you are reading this and thinking of visiting the Bloomsbury please do so, it is a very very good hotel with wonderful staff and superb food. 

It could however easily be exceptional and I hope the management team take my comments in the constructive manner they are intended.",4,2017,01,10
115,Even Better Second Time Around,"I should start by saying we found a great deal on the hotel on the TripAdvisor website. We are always keen to book directly with hotels so contacted The Bloomsbury about the deal.  They had no knowledge of it but investigated it themselves, found our deal and rang us back and price-matched it exactly meaning a £200 saving for the trip.  Even better, when we arrived we found that we had been upgraded to a Suite.
As on our first visit a year ago, the staff were brilliant.  Nothing was too much trouble and each member of staff we encountered seemed genuinely interested in us as people rather than guests.  The Suite was excellent, the breakfasts divine, and we ate twice in the Dalloway Terrace and had great food, speedily served, on each occasion.  I would have no hesitation in recommending The Bloomsbury as a great base to visit London, especially if you are taking in a show.  I'm sure we won't leave it a year before returning.",5,2017,01,09
115,Perfection,"We had an overnight stay here for my friends 40th and it was perfection.
I'd return here in a heart beat! If I could mark it with 6 stars I would.
The location was ideal for us, as we went to see The Bodyguard, which is literally two min walk away.
The hotel itself is delightful with stunning décor.  The Dalloway Terrace lived up to my expectations too.  
We had a charming gentlemen greet us as we walked in. In fact every member of Staff we came across all went that extra mile.  They look immaculate, polite and very attentive.  The Manager who runs this establishment is doing a very good job at keeping his Staff happy and it shows.
Well done to you all, you made our weekend most enjoyable.  Thank you for making it very special ;0)",5,2017,01,09
115,Gorgeous Hotel For Shopping ,"This hotel has a stunning lobby area where I love having a glass of champagne on arrival.
The restaurant, Dalloways has been open about a year and is fast becoming the place to be seen in London.
Rooms are elegant & beautiful. Like most of London, the the most basic rooms are small, but once you upgrade, the larger rooms are amazing & suites will knock your socks off.
This time I stayed in a huge suite on an upper floor which was amazing. 
All have been renovated in the last few years, so are great places to stay.
Breakfast is in the basement, and is a gorgeous buffet selection and some a la Carte options. There are healthy juices and food options available too. 
The location just off Oxford street gives access to amazing shopping. A great London hotel. 
",5,2017,01,09
115,Holiday hideaway,"The Bloomsbury exceeded our expectations as a wonderful home-base during a recent holiday trip to London. Our suite was surprisingly spacious, with a very large walk-in closet, a shower and a tub. Because our room had enclosed atrium on both sides, it was virtually silent — assuring a sound night's sleep. There's even a jewel of a bar downstairs.

The location is literally steps from the British Museum and a couple of blocks from the Tottenham Court Road tube stop.",4,2017,01,07
115,Bloomsbury a lovely place to stay,"Ijust stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel for 4 nights, I though it a lovely hotel with genuinely friendly and helpful staff, a great location and...scarily good cocktails!  Whats more to want? I will be back.",4,2017,01,07
115,Ideal over-night stay for the theatre,"Overall a fantastic experience. Walkable distance to the theatre and offered a great nights sleep in a lovely room. The price isn't just reflected on the facilities, it is the service provided as well. All staff were polite and courteous from check-in to check-out. We had an excellent evening in the bar where the staff were attentive and created the most devine cocktails; all with calming live music playing and in a lovely atmosphere. Food was sublime, even when combined with the room service.The breakfast was great quality and staff were always available to help. We were offered £20 off our bill as we booked online through their direct website!",5,2017,01,07
115,Great hotel,"Love this hotel, stayed before and the staff are really lovely and always there to help with anything, very clean rooms and comfy beds, the hotel inside is very beautiful and also love the terrace, we stay at loads of hotels in London and this is one of our top 3 👌",5,2017,01,07
115,Christmas Cracker!,"We've stayed at this hotel before and this time it was a Christmas present to ourselves.  The hotel was beautifully decorated and the staff as friendly and welcoming as always.  To exceed expectations, my husband had asked if it was possible to have a tree in our room as a surprise.  Andre, the customer services manager, saw to this personally and I was absolutely delighted.  Honestly, if you ever want to treat yourself to a London Break, please stay here, it's got the lot.  Location, style, comfort, friendly staff, atmosphere, the list is endless!",5,2017,01,06
115,"Great hotel, average service","Stayed for 2 weeks over Christmas and New Year.  The hotel itself is well located, within 100m of the British Museum and Tottenham Court Station.  The hotel is well furnished, room was clean as was the bathroom.  There were some good features in the room two, including the heated floor and bathroom mirror.  But the servicing was all over the place.  Over the 2 weeks, things were replaced (or not) at random, we often ran out of tissues and toilet paper.  Luckily we were located across from an unlocked maids storage cabinet so we were able to refurbish the room ourselves.  We were located opposite a maids station on the 5th floor and it drove us insane - the staff congregated outside the room in the morning and had loud discussions - and also in the afternoon.  We would have liked to sleep in, but it wasn't to be. We usually stay at a Radisson Edwardian in London, and will do so again in the future.  This hotel wasn't for us.",3,2017,01,04
115,Beautiful place,"Found this Hotel to be in a fantastic location, also the staff were very friendly and helpful.The Bloomsbury makes you feel like you have always stayed with them and you are part of the family which is a great feeling. My wife and i have already re booked again for this year and cannot wait again to get back.",5,2017,01,03
115,Great hotel and location,"This is the third Doyle Hotel we have used and like the others, it is run extremely well. This however, has the best location, with Oxford Street, theatreland and many other key spots including the British Museum, literally 5 minutes away. We walked to all restaurants and shows, only using a cab to get to Knightsbridge. The staff were excellent and generally have a great can-do attitude. We wanted a family dinner in the room one night, they set up a table and chairs, with chair covers and linen table cloth without was asking. Our flights were kicked out by two days due to fog (not that Cityjet felt the need to tell us) and they went to great lengths to accommodate us in identical rooms, interlinked, on a different floor, as our old room was booked up. They got us tickets to shows and into great restaurants, at last minute in two cases. There is really nothing to fault here, London is expensive and particularly hotel rooms. Bloomsbury is more boutique, than large scale grandeur, but for us that made the service and the experience more personal. ",5,2017,01,03
115,3 Nights in December,"I visited the Bloomsbury for a wedding nearby and the reception was in the hotel. From arrival to departure the staff were excellent in all areas, the room spotless and the food great, highly recommended",5,2017,01,03
115,Just lovely,"This hotel embraces you with friendliness from the door step. We came on foot from the Tube (3 mins away)and the door man came and greeted us on the pavement and carried the suitcases for us. Something which is not that common (anymore) in London, so even more cherished.
The check in was efficient and friendly, and the lobby so wonderfully decorated with a real christmas tree. The atmosphere of this hotel is special, you feel as a guest and very welcome. 
We had a regular twin room, more spacious than most hotels in this city and with comfortable beds of a decent size. The bathroom was pretty and with all you needed , articles were added daily. 
Appreciated the free water bottles that were renewed daily, and a good selection of tee, coffee and hot chocolate in the room.
The Bloomsbury is located perfectly for London center, still it is in a fairly quiet area and we had no problems with any traffic noise.
Also the room air conditioning worked perfectly, we needed both to cool and to heat during our stay.
This will be our new ""home"" in London, a warm thank you to all the great staff at The Bloomsbury for making us feel at home and welcomed.",5,2017,01,02
115,new years eve stay,great location. excellent  friendly staff and helpful even on new years day morning. we wanted somewhere close to main tourist spots and found a gem. great price and nice sized room with quality furnishings also the breakfast is worth getting up for to set you up on the day. would stay again,5,2017,01,02
115,Christmas experience,Great hotel.Staff could not do enough to make our   three day Christmas break more enjoyable. Food excellent. London is a great place to visit over Christmas period and the hotel location excellent we enjoyed walking around the uncrowded city on Christmas day and a river cruise. Then back to the hotel for a very unhurried Christmas meal. We would like to thank all the hotel staff for making our stay so pleasant. Keith and Sandra Laws.,5,2017,01,01
115,Precious ,"I will start by saying that this is probably the most unique hotel ever. You get a mix of classic and contemporary decoration as service. Everyone is friendly and welcoming. I can really say that this hotel will accomplish any request you may have. Special mention to Jero who can very well make the difference in your stay. Thank you for a magical experience.
",5,2016,12,31
115,Best experience in London ever!,WHAT A HOTEL! Nothing is too much trouble and staff is always happy to help. The rooms are amazingly decorated and the restaurante takes you to a fairy tail ambience where Nur and Barbar will definitely make your experience unique. It is definitely a return choice.,5,2016,12,31
115,Lovely Experience!,Couldn't fault anything with the high standard of service we received. I mentioned to my partner when we left that I felt extremely bad for not 'tipping' the concierge. I feel like I must return just for that reason. Highly recommend. Even are 'turn down' service was fantastic. Ultimate Customer Service at its finest! ,5,2016,12,30
115,MY FAVORITE HOTEL IN LONDON,"The second Christmas time at the Bloomsbury Hotel, fantastic stay in this wonderful hotel, enjoyed the Dalloway Terrace : MAGNIFIQUE !! I hope to come back next year with my friends and family. As always we felt very comfortable.",5,2016,12,30
115,Fabulous hotel in great location-blend of modern amenities and old world charm,"Thanks to the Bloomsbury Hotel for a wonderful stay in London with our family. Can you believe that they actually surprised our kids with Christmas stockings filled with candy and a gift on Christmas Day? Amazing service,  nice rooms, and a lovely little bar/restaurant.  Great location iin the heart of London.",5,2016,12,29
115,"Nice Room, Beautiful Hotel","On arrival we were told we had half an hour to wait for our room- despite being told check in was at 2, and we arrived at 3.30- so the room was almost 2 hours behind, naturally this left a sour taste in our mouths, although we left our luggage there and went and explored London.
When we came back our luggage was in our room which was spacious, clean and modern.
The bathroom was lovely with good soaps, body lotions etc.
The room went the extra mile in terms of decor and amenities. Stationary/  Nespresso machine/ Desk/ LED mirror. We were very pleased with the room.
Overall staff were friendly and helpful, despite our first hiccup on arrival we really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is beautiful and ideally located next to an underground station (Tottenham court Road)
Would definitely recommend. We stayed for our anniversary and watched a show in the Piccadilly theatre, a black cab back from there cost us £9- so nothing too bad!
 ",4,2016,12,29
115,Another great family stay,"Yet again I have had another super night staying here with my Mum and three children. We always get a great welcome especially from Brian at concierge. But all the staff are friendly. The reception looks welcoming and festive with the tree. Great rooms and fantastic location. The bar is warm and cosy and a super place for that last drink. Delicious breakfast.
Definitely coming back next year or hopefully before.",5,2016,12,28
115,Perfectly Ellegant and Whimsical London Hotel,"My husband and I had a lovely time at this hotel over Christmas. The hotel has an elegant feel. The decor is modern with classic British elements. The room was a fair size for a European hotel. The bed was a bit hard. Location very near the theatre district, Westminster Abby, The Mall, and not too far from The Globe and London Tower. I highly recommend it.",5,2016,12,28
115,Very good value for money,"The moment you enter the impressive front lounge, you realize that this hotel has a colourful history. The interior looks like a club and is warm and welcoming. Our room was large enough with all the comfort you need. I recommend to go for a king or queen size bed to get all the space you need. The guests in our neighbour room were quite noisy during the night. When we mentioned this at the the reception, they were very flexible in giving us another room, also very spacious. 
I have to say the service was excellent: friendly, professional and flexible.
Breakfast at the hotel is not really recommended. There are places enough in the neighbourhood where you can eat a full breakfast at a time that's convenient for you.
Anyway, this luxurious hotel is certainly worthwhile to book to have a relaxing stay with a very good location.
Little note: if you put something in the fridge of your room or pull out the plug of the fridge, it's possible you get a wrong bill concerning your consumptions.",4,2016,12,28
115,Fabulous evening,"First visit but won't be the last ! 
Bloomsbury is a lovely place. Cocktails are amazing and food very good. All the staff were friendly, attentive and professional. I had a very great time, I'm coming soon !",5,2016,12,27
115,The Bloomsbury.....THE place to stay in London......,"After a VirginAir direct flight from San Francisco and a long ride via Uber direct from Heathrow Term.3 to the hotel it was nice to step out onto this quiet street into the hotel lobby to check in. Had chosen this hotel for its 'central' London location and the architect Edwin Lutyens design.(Had the pleasure to see his masterworks Government buildings in New Delhi). And what a fine time we had!
Even before we'd arrived had made numerous inquiries with concierge Brian Murphy, who I will nominate for a Knighthood, securing Thanksgiving dinner reservation for our party of 6 at Bar Boulud Mandarin Oriental, when connected friends in London could not do same! Also very smoothly, day tour of Stonehenge/Bath, theatre tickets for Wicked, nearby Indian restaurants and more.....forget Air BnB....concierges rule!
We asked for a front facing room off the street and 526 was near perfect especially since the layout was much like our Napa home and had a bathtub as requested by her ladyship! Ice buckets for in room cocktails were delivered promptly with fresh lemon wedges....so nice!
We opted for breakfast included and it was well worth it. The selection, staff service and wide time window allowed for early starters as well and hungover late arrival. Sweet!
Mostly though the location of The Bloomsbury cannot be beat. Steps away from Oxford and Regent streets for premier shopping, people watching and brilliantly lit up for the Christmas Holidays. The British Museum is a must do also a stones throw away. Tottenham Court Underground is right there!! Covent garden, the London Eye tacky but big fun a walk away....
We did lots, saw family and long lost friends and yes, will come back no doubt, stay at The Bloomsbury and do more.......",4,2016,12,27
115,Why would you want to leave?,"We spent five nights at the Bloomsbury, leaving on Christmas Day to come home. It was a great pleasure in every way! It is an architectural gem, having been designed by the great English architect, Sir Edwin Lutyens, as a women's club and YWCA in the late 1920's. It is on a quiet street two blocks from the British Museum and walking distance to the West End theaters, the National Gallery and the famous shopping streets. The staff is young and extremely courteous. The food is outstanding. The rooms are up to date in every way. We had a 'Superior Queen"" on the fourth floor which was very nice but a little bit smaller than I expected. I hope we return some day and we might try the next class up for a little more floor space. In one of the most expensive cities in the work, a stay at The Bloomsbury is a good value. But it is also elegant and very civilized. Highly recommended!",5,2016,12,27
115,Wonderful hotel to serve as your base in London whether on business or with family,"I have enjoyed this hotel when in London on business and  was confident that choosing this hotel for a Christmas vacation with our family would be perfect.  i was correct great hotel, wonderful service and a nice oasis just between the British Museum and Oxford Street. Rooms were available in the morning when arrived from Canada which was very appreciated. Great tea and restaurant.. no need to look else where  so plan to have special dinners and afternoon  tea here.",5,2016,12,26
115,loved it here,"I stayed here for three days over christmas and it had everything . Great location not far from the West End / Oxford Street /Theatreland but feels very calm and unhurried . The hotel is very smart without feeling as if it is trying too hard and the staff are very friendly without being overbearing . I ate in the front reception area which is good for tea , Dalloways which I found a little cold but probably very nice in the summer and also the Bloomsbury bar which was very cosy and atmospheric . The piped music is very varied and I was impressed that it was not just a diet of Christmas mush .
Good value too considering all the above and I would recommend it to anyone .",5,2016,12,26
115,The service is second to none...,"My boyfriend and I have just returned from visiting The Bloomsbury for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The  initial room we were allocated was too small for my liking therefore we upgraded to the next class - if your pocket allows, I would recommend upgrading to a Deluxe Room or Suite. The hotel itself is clean, beautifully decorated and both the bar and Dalloway Terrace Restaurant are stunning at night. What sets this hotel apart however is the staff. Andre was an exceptionally friendly, professional and efficient General Manager and both the breakfast and bar staff had impeccable etiquette. The area was ok (personally I prefer the Mayfair area), however if you are catching a show - it is perfect. A lovely hotel made better by it's staff. ",4,2016,12,26
115,My HOME in LONDON,"I LOVED LOVED LOVED my stay at the Bloomsbury.   ( 12/10-12/18 )

The Bloomsbury staff made my first ever visit to London extra special.  I stayed in this hotel for a good 8days for business and boy, it felt like I was home with friends/family the entire week.  Talk about first class customer service, they made me feel so welcome, and made it hard for me to leave. Imagine 8days at the hotel  –I did meet wonderful folks who work there. 

I wish I have gotten everyone’s name down so I can include them in this review – but the ones who really stood out are the following;
Front Desk Team:  Zain, Sebastian and the Front desk Team, Camille, Oana, Jero – They were there from day 1 to welcome me.  Super helpful with all of my questions about pretty much everything.  (Places to go to, places to eat at, where to do at night, etc etc etc)  What I loved the most about the team is that they engage with their customers, and everything felt genuine when talking with them. Everyone was just very pleasant and helpful.  

Bloomsbury Breakfast team – Maria, Alladin, George, Maya –I felt super spoiled by this team!    They were way accommodating and would always serve their guests with a smile.   I would always look forward to the mornings so I can see them, have small chats and of course have my cappuccino and breakfast.   Maria is very kind and would always make sure that everything’s alright.  (reminds me of my mom).  

Dalloway Team – Estellita, Joel, Joao, Andre(manager), Eljesa & Ricardo (sorry if I missed anyone) – outstanding Team! The yummy and creative cocktails made Joel is definitely a highlight of my trip.. I love how he would take  time to chat with his customers and share how he comes up with the awesome drinks.  Dinner was always superp, menu is great and service from Andre, Eljesa, Ricardo (and others) is just simply top notch.  Glad to have met them.  
Super grateful to have met Estellita who’s pretty much ‘all-around’, she is awesome and definitely make customers feel at home… and I remember her introducing me to everyone even the chef.  

Overall – I know that this will be my “HOME” in London whenever I visit.. thank you again for the great memories.
",5,2016,12,23
115,Excellent!,"The hotel is very calm and relaxing compared to the hustle and bustle of the West end. Great start as we arrived early and the rooms were already for us to go straight up. The rooms are very well presented the beds are very comfortable. Ideally situated as only a 2 mins walk from Tottenham Court Road tube station and the Dominion theatre where we were seeing the Bodyguard. All the staff at the hotel are very polite and helpful which always makes a big difference. We enjoyed pre-dinner cocktails in the Bloomsbury bar where they were quite happy to make cocktails not on the menu. Breakfast the following morning was first rate, good choice and good quality. All in all a very relaxing and enjoyable stay and will most definitely be returning very soon.",5,2016,12,22
115,Once again a perfect stay ,"We always try to stay in different hotels if we go away but this is one of very few that we have returned to and within the same year. Everything was wonderful as we remembered from staying earlier in the year. The hotel's location is perfect, we walked to theatres, museums, restaurants, shops and the tube being so close by means nothing is too far away. The classy and luxury feel of the hotel makes it perfect for a special stay, rooms were lovely and breakfast was delicious again. We happened to be there the weekend that a famous cocktail team were appearing so we loved the opportunity to sit in the sophisticated, laid-back bar for live music and fabulous cocktails. The staff were all attentive and made you feel like a valued customer- a lady on front of house at breakfast (I think she was called Maria?) was particularly welcoming and friendly. Finally, a huge thank you once again to Sebastian. He helped us greatly before our first stay and I contacted him again this time to make a room/birthday request and once again he was only too happy to assist. A real credit to the hotel and brand as a whole. ",5,2016,12,22
115,Just a great hotel with great staff.,"Stayed at The Bloomsbury for my wife's 40th birthday. It was a surprise for her so I really needed it to go well. We were not disappointed. It was everything we had hoped it would be. Great location within walking distance of lots of restaurants. Theatres were only a brief stroll away and shopping in Oxford Street is right on your doorstep. The Underground is close by if you need to use it but there were plenty of Taxi's available outside the hotel. 
Staff were courteous and polite from the start without being over zealous. Check in was swift and easy and all amenities were explained. Lobby is huge and well equipped and had been decorated for Christmas which looked lovely. Room was well appointed and clean as you would expect with minibar and coffee machine.
I would like to say thank you to the staff in making it a special night for us, they even managed to give my wife a card and a small birthday cake. It was a small gesture but it really made the difference. 
I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone and will definitely be back but this time for more than just one night.

Thank you Bloomsbury for making it a special night for us.",5,2016,12,21
115,Bloomsbury bliss!,"Clean, well equipped room-Nespresso machine a nice touch; help with its operation was prompt when we callled reception. Friendly helpful staff in dining room addressed you by name (a first for us!) and bottled water given for our onward journey by courteous front of house staff. A pleasant stay was finished with discounted parking at nearby car park making it memorable by being stress free!",4,2016,12,21
115,Company Christmas party venue,"The hotel is really nice, on arrival I was given complementary mulled wine and the checkin process was very straightforward. 

The room was very nice, and absolutely spotless. 

The Christmas party was good too, the food was ok but then it was a Christmas party so you have to have the traditional turkey etc. 

Breakfast was really nice too.",5,2016,12,20
115,Class of its own.,"Spent our wedding annivesary here. It is truly in a class of its own. The staff were  friendly yet professional and helpful. The room was clean with beautiful marble finishing that gives the room to a very classy and elegant look. Very convenient, a stone throw away from Tottenham Court Road tube station, Soho, British Museum. There was a variety of breakfast including full British breakfast that was so delicious and cooked to perfection. Will definitely spend another night in this hotel in future.",4,2016,12,19
115,"Good, but cannot fully agree with the other reviews","Based on my pre-trip tripadvisor readings the service level at the hotel should have been exceptional - however, I didn't feel that way. Overall yes, okay service, but excellent is different. A quick example. 1) My flight was heavily delayed, since i would not make it to the hotel / an evening play in time I emailed the hotel the tickets to print and to place in my parents room. It took me 2 more calls and my parents to visit the reception twice to obtain the tickets and everyone was terribly uninformed 2) We wanted to eat at the Dallaway terrace and one of the staff told us 'fully booked, impossible', the other staff told us shortly after 'no problem at all'. At night time we were almost the only people in the restaurant at 9pm. 
Rooms are okay, even though tiny (general problem in London, I guess). Price value also okay. All in all a hotel where i would stay again (Was actually my second stay), but does not deserve the rating ""fantastic or exceptional"". Oh and the christmas decoration was lovely!",4,2016,12,19
115,Let down by cost cutting in the kitchen,"The hotel is smart and service is good. Room quality and space all good - especially given the price was pretty reasonable for central London (£230 per night). 

It wasn't perfect though - the room service menu was disappointingly short and dull (why not leave the restaurant menu's in the rooms too)? But then when the food did come the burger was small and pretty mediocre, as was the crumble and custard. Despite being served in little dishes it was obvious that the ketchup wasn't Heinz (it was cheap and acidic), and the orange juice was also cheap and nasty (certainly not freshly squeezed). So whilst they got most things right, I certainly wouldn't bother with their room service again!",4,2016,12,19
115,Festive and wonderful service,"Enjoyed an excellent and festive stay at this hotel last week. Staff were wonderful and supported our meeting on site very efficiently. Special thanks to maya and estelita in the catering team who were excellent hosts at breakfast each morning.

Thanks! ",5,2016,12,19
115,Nice to be back!,"We just love coming back to stay at the Bloomsbury!

On this occasion it was a very special occasion part of which needed easy access to The Shaftesbury Theatre for a great show!

The Bloomsbury is so well placed, just 5 minutes from Tottenham Court Rd Tube station and similar times to the Dominion Theatre, The Shaftesbury Theatre and the great Soho night life restaurants, Bars etc!!

The Hotel itself is a very comforting place, nice and quiet and perfectly relaxing with lovely bars and restaurants.

The room we had on the 8th floor is really nice, almost a mini-suite, very nicely appointed and lovely and comfortable.

Front desk couldn't be any more helpful - and a special thank you to the breakfast dining room Team - helpful and caring, no OTT, no frills, just good service and freshly cooked food - no heating lamp serving areas!

We will be coming back as our place to be for Central London - well done ""The Bloomsbury""!!",5,2016,12,19
115,Wonderful place in a great location and lovely staff,"I can't praise this hotel enough - from the initial welcome with mulled wine and hot towels for our hands, the personal message on the mirror to my 9 year old daughter, the milk and cookies every evening, the clean and comfortable room, the stunning Dalloway Terrace and afternoon tea, to the central location for the shows. What sets this hotel apart from all the others I've stayed in is the staff - so welcoming, always ready with a smile and a question about our day or our stay - we felt like cherished guests the whole time and were really sad to leave our little Bloomsbury bubble! Thank you to you all for being so lovely. Needless to say, we shall be booking again :)

(We stayed in a superior room converted to twin and were in London to see a show, go ice skating and visit the British Museum - a really perfect location for all three)",5,2016,12,19
115,Birthday treat,"Brought my Husband to London for a weekend away celebrating his 30th Birthday and what a weekend we had. 

We arrived a couple of hours earlier than the check in time and we planned to just leave our bags and go and explore. To our delight the hotel said our room was ready and allowed us to check in early. We found a beautiful room with a large comfortable bed.

The hotel very kindly send up a surprise cake for my husband with a lovely birthday message. Thank you for this. 

This hotel is perfectly placed for a trip to the theatre and for a spot of shopping. We would not hesitate to recommend it.

There were a few very small negatives on our trip, but this did not take away from the whole experience. I am only mentioning them as this would have resulted in an 'excellent' rating from us so the hotel may wish to know. 
Firstly, we asked the concierge for a dinner recommendation before our trip to the theatre, but he never actually recommended anywhere to eat. We walked away with information of 'there are lots of places to eat'. As we are not from the city we would have appreciated it if we could have received some recommendations as this ended up with us wandering about the city with an iPhone following a map. 
Secondly, the walls separating us from the adjoining room were so thin which meant we could hear all the antics of the room next door. Plus there were a couple of marks on the wall of the room.
Finally, when we came to take a shower in the morning one of the towels had a large rip to it. I don't quite know how this was not spotted when folding it. ",4,2016,12,19
115,What a gem,"My first stay at The Bloomsbury and will not be my last.  From arrival I was greeted with such helpful friendliness, this continued throughout my stay.  The room was beautifully furnished and very comfortable.  Delicious breakfast!",5,2016,12,19
115,Superb Hotel,"We've recently returned from a weekend break, spending 2 nights at The Bloomsbury. For friendliness, convenience and comfort, the Bloomsbury scores top marks. The staff are exemplary and although we didn't use all the facilities, what we did was very good.

The hotel is literally a few minutes walk to sights like the British Museum, Soho is a short walk, there's a tube station a few minutes away and the sights of Oxford St, Covent Garden and the rest of London are easily accessible by foot or tube.

Our room was spacious, (for central London), and had all the facilities we required. If I were to give one minor black mark, it would be the £26.88 cost of a rum&coke + gin&tonic in the hotel bar. You expect to pay extra in London, but I'd suggest this cost is prohibitive for many people. It made us limit this to our only drink in the hotel anyway.",5,2016,12,19
115,Fantastic stay at great location,"This swank hotel offered everything we desired. Arriving a day late, without our luggage, the hotel was located a block from the major shopping street of Oxford. We were able to shop for everything we needed to get us through the first few days. So it was convenient, yet quiet. Also, being a block from the underground and major bus route, public transportation was very accessible.The hotel offered a beautiful terrace restaurant as well as a speakeasy underground bar. We were close to the theater district and able to enjoy much of the city on foot. The concierge was very helpful with directions, maps, taxis and suggestions. It was a perfect choice for us!",5,2016,12,17
115,Excellent stay,"Very relaxing atmosphere! Good service and attention to detail. I can highly recommend the Bar and the live music was really good. Will definitely return!!

I do believe in positive feedback where it is due, keep up the good work",5,2016,12,14
115,Excellent !!! ,"Everything is perfect at this hotel- from the room, bar, service and the brekki option is incredible- you won't be starving after trying all their offerings in the buffet. 
I have stayed 3 times now and I must say that all the crew in particular Estelita, Maya, Mark  and Georgi couldn't do more for you if you asked! Well done- see you in April!

115,"Excellent hotel, excellent service!","Stayed for one night with my friend. Wonderfully friendly staff who anticipated and met every need. Clean rooms, very good food. The location is really handy to city, shopping. I would definetely come back. Thank you to all at the Bloomsbury Hotel for looking after us so well. Special thanks to Martina, Jero, Sebastian, Gunilla, Mariam, Alladin, Chris, Maria, Estellita.",5,2016,12,12
115,Excellent in Every Respect,"This is a beautiful first class hotel. We stayed for nine nights last month celebrating a major birthday.  Our room was very clean with a comfortable bed. It was of adequate size and quiet.
The staff here is outstanding, friendly and accommodating. Every single one of them. Special kudos to concierge Brian who should receive an award for ""the most helpful person in the UK."" Is there an a medal for this? There should be.
Also doorman Ivan and lounge host Joao should be singled out too. Ivan is always cheerful and fun to talk with. Joao made our drinks and tea times memorable  with his conversation and service.
I would return here without a doubt.",5,2016,12,12
115,Lovely stay in a great location.,"Our stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel was lovely. Staff are so helpful and friendly, and the hotel itself is elegant yet comfortable. It's also perfectly situated for seeing London--easy access walking to many areas or to transport. Would definitely stay again. ",5,2016,12,12
115,Lovely afternoon tea,"I came here with a friend for a traditional afternoon tea. The service was excellent, friendly staff in high numbers who were always checking back to see we had enough food. The refills are complimentary and the food was really lovely. Nothing to complain about!
Be aware that a service charge will be added to your bill (Ours was £7.50 on a £60 bill) but the service is excellent so this is to be expected.
Definitely recommend.",5,2016,12,12
115,"Great Location, Fantastic Cocktails, Excellent Breakfast, Friendly Staff","Stayed here for one night (10/12/16). Booked based on requiring a location close to Theatreland and something a bit luxurious. Both were achieved with the Bloomsbury. 

Fantastic location, really close to the theatres, Oxford St., British Museum, etc. The hotel itself is beautiful inside and there is a lovely relaxed atmosphere there. Fans of Edwin Luytens wilh love it here as he was the building's architect.

The Club bar on the lower ground floor has some fantastic cocktails made by the very friendly & charming bar staff. Really nice bar food snacks. Lovely atmosphere in the bar.

The room (double on the 5th floor, 522) was a generous Goldilocks size; not too big, not too small. Very nicely decorated and very well laid out sockets, TV, etc. Very comfortable bed with lots of pillows. Excellent toiletries (Aromatherapy Associates) in very generous sizes. Nespresso machine & kettle, iron & ironing board all in the room.

The full breakfast was included in the room rate and it was great; bacon, sausage, black pudding, eggs, mushrooms, tomato, lots of toast, full access to the buffet as well. We were stuffed afterwards. High quality ingredients in the breakfast (I know my breakfasts!)

Overall a very lovely place to stay that turned a well-deserved trip to the theatre into a very memorable occasion. I will happily stay here again.",5,2016,12,12
115,Amazing!!!,"the hotel is amazing, the guys who work there are amazing. The events team made sure everything wet well. Love em all. would recommend the hotel to friends and will definitely be using the hotel for events and stays in the future ",5,2016,12,12
115,A wonderful weekend,"We recently stayed overnight at the Bloomsbury whilst collecting my 50th birthday present.  This was a last minute booking and I came upon the hotel by chance.  I can honestly say it is the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in!  Beautiful furnishing, lovely atmosphere and exceptional staff.  It should be a 5 star Hôtel as nothing was too much trouble.  Had a fabulous evening in the bar after being out for diner, the bar tenders were amazing and the cocktails were incredible.  Breakfast was a feast and superbly presented.  All in all this made our weekend as we experienced shocking service elsewhere.  We will definitely be back.  This is now our London base.",5,2016,12,12
115,Great stay ,"I stayed at this hotel for two nights whilst in London on business last week. It's a great place with a modern boutique feel.
It has everything you could need under one roof - a nice restaurant and bar with a gorgeous outside terrace. 
The bedroom was spacious and very well equipped - lots of nice touches that have been well thought through! 
The selection of freshly made juices and smoothies also added a nice - I had one with breakfast each morning. I would highly recommend this place and will most definitely return ",5,2016,12,11
115,50th Birthday celebration,"I booked this hotel after much thought and based reviews i had read. It was a special occasion and i wanted a special hotel to match, the Bloomsbury did not disappoint.

From the moment we entered the hotel we were greeted by friendly and helpful staff, making us feel very welcome.  The main reason for booking this hotel was for the beautiful decor, the photos on the website did it justice.  The main reception and seating area was luxurious, and so was our bedroom.

The breakfast in the morning was also top quality, from the cooked english to the lovely  pastries. 

This hotel was more than i would usually spend but i wanted to push the boat out for something really special and i am so glad i chose the Bloomsbury.  I would definitely book it again for another special ocassion.",5,2016,12,11
115,Best Service ever!,"Consistently exceptional service during the stay with a special mention to Eljesa for her very high standard of service and never ending cheerfulness whenever we saw her, thank you!
I would of recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay for business or just to enjoy London.",5,2016,12,10
115,Comfortable and friendly ,"Everything is great in this hotel. Have been staying here for 4 years and always get comfortable staying with high quality of service. 
I enjoy breakfasts, mostly when Estelita is there. She is very thoughtful, helpful and always makes my day. Even food is delicious when she is there. 
Hope, to come back here soon! 
",5,2016,12,10
115,Location Ambiance and Service,"Perfect location on a quiet side street,
Walking distance to the tube , British Museum, the seven Dials (a charming quarter) as well as the theatre district.

This neogeorgian hotel has a great atmosphere, the rooms are very comfortable and the staff is friendly and helpful.

We will definetely return 

",5,2016,12,08
115,Beautiful and convenient,"A bit of a splurge, but cheaper than most Manhattan hotels. After we got over our initial disappointment about room and bed size (inescapable in London), we began to love this hotel.  The staff was extremely helpful and always friendly.  The location is ideal - just two blocks from the British Museum, a short walk to most West End Theatres and Covent Garden, and the Tottenham Court Underground Station just around the corner.  We ate at Dalloway Terrace in late November, so it was a bit chilly since it's usually an outdoor venue, but they had covered it for the winter, had heat lamps, and offered my wife a blanket for her legs.  We thoroughly enjoyed the meal.  The holiday decorations there and throughout the hotel were spectacular.  The hotel was quiet and the smallish beds were comfortable.  Room service was excellent (a bit pricy, though, so we only did it once).  Be sure to check out the historic library and chapel (from its days as the first YWCA in England) on the second floor.  We loved our stay, and we'll be back someday!",5,2016,12,08
115,A calm oasis in central london,"I always love walking into the Bloomsbury...the doors open and you leave the hustle and bustle of stations and busy streets behind. The whole ambiance of the reception welcomes you...the mood lighting and the wonderful smell of the Bloomsbury signature candle...not to mention extremely friendly, efficient staff. A hot towel is presented at reception...this is the start of the calming experience....and within minutes you find yourself in one of the beautifully designed rooms. some are small, but all have great amenities....everything you need, whether travelling on business or for pleasure. 

",5,2016,12,07
115,Great nite ,"We visited this hotel as part of a champagne tasting event which was held in one of the function rooms. The staff were very helpful and friendly, the hotel it Self is really nice with a nice bar area, not sure how much it is to stay here but don't think it's cheap but certainly a beautiful building to stay in.",5,2016,12,06
115,25/11/16,"I'm so sorry I haven't been able to write this sooner. We stayed at The Bloomsbury on the 25/11 and I just wanted to say how absolutely fantastic it was. From Gabriella on check in at reception, our beautiful room, dinner on Dalloway Terrace, breakfast(which was delicious and the continental selection looked amazing and fresh), to Zaira on check out. The staff were all courteous and nothing was too much trouble, whilst still remaining unobtrusive throughout our stay. When we are next in London we will most definitely be returning! Thank you!",5,2016,12,06
115,One night stay,Have to say really enjoyed my experience of the Bloomsberry. Took my girlfriend for an overnight stay to visit the Dominion Theatre and overall it was a very positive experience. Room was a little small but perhaps that's normal for central London. Only downside for me was the price of drinks in the Terrace Bar which were exorbitant! Mind you the bar was packed with people so perhaps again I'm just not used to London prices. Would certainly consider going back however.,4,2016,12,06
115,Excellent hotel,Went to London for the weekend with friends . Stayed here lots of times . Lovely hotel in the heart of London with great staff . Breakfast is freshly made and always great . Nice atmosphere and beautiful decor . ,5,2016,12,05
115,Great Hotel,"I have visited the Bloomsbury on a number of occasions to stay, for a business conference, for dinner in their restaurant and last Friday for lunch in the Dalloway Terrace. A common theme joins them all and it is the high level of comfort standards  linked to first class personal service making a visit a great experience whatever the reason for being there. Much of this must be attributed to their general manager, Mike Neve, who I have found to keep the high standards himself as well as instill them in his excellent staff. For all these reasons we will be back.",5,2016,12,05
115,Bloomsbury Hotel,Social spaces not five star quality and lacks a more private drinks lounge but staff very attentive. Room fine overall but competition in this price range is strong. Ideal for Shaftesbury and New London theatres.,4,2016,12,04
115,My 22nd birthday treat!,"Wow! Our second visit to this lovely hotel! It did not disappoint, from the beautiful Christmas tree in the lobby to the finer details like the petals placed on my bed, this hotel is by far the best we have stayed at in London.

The breakfast is wonderful and the cocktails in the bar are also a must! We enjoyed our one night stay and we are definitely going to be staying in 2017! 

Warm towels upon entry and the concierge desk was extremely helpful, taking our bags and even opening the grand doors to us, they make you feel like royalty. 

The room has all the essentials you need; Large TV, big beds, comfort all round. 

The best part is, it's so close to all the main attractions, there's no need to take the subway! 
Thanks for our amazing experience the Bloomsbury hotel",5,2016,12,04
115,My favorite London hotel!,"Just came back from a 5 nights vacation in London.
This is my 3rd time at this lovely hotel and there are not enough words to describe my satisfaction. It was my daughter's 18th birthday and Ms. Julia from CS made sure that a cake with a welcoming card would be at our room upon arrival. The location of the hotel is impossible to beat: walking distance to all major attractions: Soho, Covent Garden, Oxford St. and more with Tottenham court rd station almost at your door step (both central and northern lines are there). breakfast was wonderful with a great service and food. We will be back!",5,2016,12,03
115,College trip,Hi I came for a college trip today to the Bloomsbury hotel we had a look round and had lunch the room are good size nice an cozy they are friendly and welcoming bunch of staff the food was excellent I couldn't ask for anything better that was the best food I have ever tasted that for the experience and hope to see you all again soon. I would go and tell my friends and family it was that good. ,5,2016,12,02
115,What a fabulous weekend!,"We stayed at The Bloomsbury for my husbands 40th birthday and I have to say, the service was exemplary!  The staff and hotel helped make our weekend celebrations truly memorable.  We even managed to get a place at the outdoor cinema and had a wonderful evening enjoying the delights of The Dalloway Terrace where Joel took excellent care of us.
We wouldn't hesitate to book a room at The Bloomsbury; the service is excellent, great rooms, good food & drink and fabulous location.  I can't wait for our next trip to London - this time, I won't spend hours trawling the net looking for somewhere to stay as there is only one choice for us!! ",5,2016,12,02
115,Fabulous Hotel,"Location is very convenient for Oxford Street, Regent Street and Covent Garden- all are within walking distance if you don't mind walking for 15minutes or so. The staff were brilliant and the Hotel is beautiful. Only slight downside were the 'noisy neighbours' on our first night! The bar areas are both lovely and relaxing and the cocktails were lovely. ",5,2016,12,01
115,Excellent service and location,"Other than the nice ambience of the hotel, the room is very comfortable, staff are friendly and helpful. The location is great as there are many restaurants and shopping within walking distance. I came for business trip but I would love to come back again for leisure travel! ",5,2016,12,01
115,...,My partners mum brought us a night in London so we got to stay in this beautiful hotel. It poured down which is normal but the hotel gave us umbrellas when we left the hotel and a towel if we was wet when we entered the hotel which I though was quite nice. The room was beautiful and so was the bathroom. The staff were all very kind friendly and helpful,5,2016,11,30
115,PERFECT CENTRAL LOCATION!,"This hotel is 3 blocks from the British Museum, one block from the Tube and in a perfect central location.  In addition, it is a lovely hotel with comfortable rooms and a very accommodating and helpful staff.  We did not eat in the hotel but the restaurant looked very nice.  There are quite a number of outside food sources in the general area.  I would certainly stay there again and would recommend the hotel to anyone visiting London.",5,2016,11,30
115,Convenient but expensive,We chose the hotel for its proximity to the Shaftesbury Theater as I have recently had knee surgery and cannot walk far. Although we appreciated the hotel has a good position and facilities we still felt aggrieved at having to pay £230 for a nights accommodation without breakfast. The room was very nice and cosy with everything you would expect in a 5 star hotel. Bathroom a bit narrow but well kitted out. If money is no object we would stay again I am sure.,4,2016,11,30
115,Anniversary Surprise,"This hotel is beautiful. The rooms are typical of a city hotel in terms of sizing. Decor all round is very tasteful and the bathroom is stunning. Amenities in room include: 
Mini bar 
Iron and board 
Safe 
Hair dryer 
TV 
WiFi 

I will also mention that the service from the minute you arrive at the hotel is outstanding. Breakfast is pricey so I recommend having breakfast included with your booking. ",5,2016,11,30
115,Lovely hotel which started off so well,"We were put into this hotel after being double booked at another hotel.  Lovely hotel in good location, we ordered breakfast to have in our room and duly ticked off what we wanted and left menu outside on our door the night before.  Next morning we waited and waited when we looked outside the door our menu was still hanging there!!  We know mistakes happen, but it was a disappointing end to our lovely weekend.  The rooms next to us had breakfast delivered ok?? So if your ordering room service our advise is to check they have taken your menu.",4,2016,11,29
115,Nice hotel  in a good situation,"The Bloomsbury is a nice hotel, very comfortable & luxurious. We were well looked after in almost all aspects, although we did not eat in the hotel. The room was a good size with a comfortable bed, although not sure I appreciated a huge mirror on the wall alongside the bed. Whilst mirrors do add light to a room its a bit intrusive. The room was quiet in terms of other guest noise but like so many hotels noisy fans outside made it difficult to open the windows which I find essential as rooms are stuffy, and for a good nights sleep. If you are noise sensitive and your room is near the fans, you may want ear plugs.  
The check in and consciege were all very good and helpful , waiting bar staff very poor took forever (on two successive days)  to get a drink. The hotel is near British Museum, and close to Soho, Oxford Street, Covent  Garden and shopping so you can walk to all which given traffic and state of the tube is good, and a plus point for this hotel.",4,2016,11,28
115,"great hotel, cosy and elegant","This is a very special hotel. It was my third time in it and I love it. As soon as you enter the hall you can feel the cosy and elegant atmosphere of the hotel. It is decorated with very good taste which makes you feel very comfortable. The food this time was much better than the last one. The salmon for breakfast is very good quality and the food of the lunch buffet was also delicious. The location is excellent to go visit the BritishMuseum, Oxford Street, Soho, etc. I definitely reccommend it.",5,2016,11,28
115,Simply marvellous,"Greta location, great stay, great staff (especially Phillipo on the outside terrace). Will definitely return again. We didn't eat here so can't comment on the food. We also didn't have any issues so can't comment on how the staff are trained to help you. ",5,2016,11,28
115,Weekend at the Bloomsbury ,"Great hotel, prime location, most helpful & service oriented staff. The hostess in the dining hall even remembered our names on our 2nd breakfast along with our favorite dishes. Only 5 minutes walking distance from oxford st., 15 minutes walking from the soho. Highly recommended hotel!",5,2016,11,27
115,"Lovely, but disappointing","A lovely hotel, in a beautiful building and a great location.  My room was very small, but very comfortable (although water pressure from the shower was rather pathetic and the bath tub rather small).  Breakfast is simply dreadful - uncomfortable seating, loud music and mildly irritating staff.  The hotel also tried to charge me over £20 for a cappuccino and two slices of bread, telling me that there is a fixed charge for breakfast!  After three phone calls, I was rather gracelessly offered a credit of 50%.  Just not the experience one expects from a 5 star hotel.  ""Must try harder...""",3,2016,11,27
115,Quick stay,"Location is perfect, service is very good but the room size is too small for me and my son.
Reception staff were very helpful.
Rooms would be more suitable for business trips where you would not have to stay in the room for long periods ",3,2016,11,27
115,Very Accommodating,"My husband, 9 month old baby girl and myself stayed for two nights during our trip over from Australia. We hired a portacot which was a beautiful wooden cot complete with blankets, pillows, a teddy bear and even bath / shower amenities specific for babies and children. We had breakfast both mornings and the staff could not have been more accommodating for our baby girl. We treated my mother and sister-in-law to a night there during our stay and they absolutely love it and will be returning in the very near future. 
If I had one criticism / request, it would be to make their wifi private and give codes out, as the public wifi caused my social media to be hacked.
All in all a wonderful experience and we highly recommend The Bloomsbury",5,2016,11,26
115,great hotel and location,"I have stayed at other properties when coming to London but this one is my number one option, as long as they are available for my dates of travel I stay with them. The hotel is beautiful and the staff is very well trained on how to give a very professional service, always very welcoming and friendly. The hotel location is perfect as it is right at the heart of London yet is not an overly busy street.

As I come here for business I did not have time to enjoy the lovely bar/terrace they have, but it looks amazing for those who may have a little more time during the stay.

 

",5,2016,11,26
115,Evening meal & meeting,"Part of a medium size party( about 20) who had the library room for a private meeting which included a 3 course meal and drinks. The venue and room were lovely. The meal however was very slow to be served and not considered in terms of getting the meals out to the group:they got the wrong food to the people who'd ordered it and we had to ask for the spoons for the soup. When we did get to eat it I would describe it a tepid. The main courses tasted fine, when we got them. Desserts were fine. Would not recommend this venue for this type of event if this is their standard of service.",3,2016,11,25
115,Wonderful atmosphere,"What a wonderful atmosphere 

On a whim I pulled my closes friend into the Bloomsbury Hotel off Tottenham Court road station , London for a quick drink. 

I was just craving a fresh fruit blend spiked . My word !  I was late for my shoot after the most vibrant personality hit me with service . 

I spent hours in this wonderful atmosphere. Her flaming red hair and wonderful service robbed me from my dollars like it was worth nothing .The menu gripped my glutinous curiosity. 

Very few places I find this impressive as the customer service at The Bloomsbury was impeccable . 

To the management I congratulated you on a job well done !",5,2016,11,23
115,FEELING WELCOME IN LONDON,"great hotel; lovely brick grand building; so close to théâtres and shopping Streets, and UCL campus;
the perfect hotel for a family visit, shopping, theatre, and a lovely place for a drink, excellent food and good service; breakfast service is outstanding;",5,2016,11,23
115,"Perfectly lovely, quiet place","We loved our roomy, little room at The Bloomsbury. we opted for a room that was about two steps above basic so we got roominess. A queen bed, armchair with ottoman and lamp, desk, and roomy closet. The bathrooms are a little small and the shower is a little narrow to my liking but everything was neat, clean and shipshape. The staff are lovely, especially the helpful concierges. And the bar has lovely cocktail inventions.",4,2016,11,23
115,Wonderful Hotel !,I have stayed at this hotel a number of times & just love it. Not only in a great location but  offers some of the best service we have ever come across in London. The hotel is beautiful & spotlessly clean & the breakfast divine!!!!,5,2016,11,23
115,"""By far the best hotel we have stayed in""","First visit to the Bloomsbury, thoroughly enjoyed our 2 night stay.  The hotel was first class, room was just perfect, very comfortable indeed.  The Dalloway Terrace was just stunning and the food exquisite, best fish and chips ever consumed.  The staff were so attentive, nothing was too much trouble, lovely people.

Perfect location in the centre of London, Covent Garden, theatre land, British Museum a stone's throw away.",5,2016,11,22
115,weekend vacation in the city,"very friendly staff & a great overall experience, we stayed there for a long weekend, excellent drinks at the bar, friendly atmosphere in the lobby, good selection for breakfast, housekeeping very friendly ",5,2016,11,22
115,Beautiful hotel with staff who are warm and welcoming,"We stayed here for 1 night over the weekend and loved every minute. The staff in particular stand out. Very welcoming, keen to help without being overbearing and who give off the air of being happy to work in the hotel, which really adds to the ambience.

We had mentioned it was our anniversary - they left chocolate dipped strawberries and a congratulations note in our bedroom. And then when we returned from our night out, we had rose petals on the bed spelling out the word love. It was a a very thoughtful gesture and shows their attention to detail.

The hotel itself is a beautiful building (read up on its fascinating history with the book provided in the room) with many of the historic features intact. I loved the classic decor and the bedrooms were clean tidy and comfortable. The hotel bar is worth a visit.

I really liked the fact it had the Seamus Heaney library. It showed that the Bloomsbury is not just a hotel aimed solely at profits, but it also wants to culturally invest.

I would love to come back again - but for longer!

Thank you Bloomsbury for a great night away.",5,2016,11,21
115,Will now be my 1st choice London hotel! ,"Just returned from an amazing stay at the Bloomsbury. Really could not fault it. Room was perfect, sheets and pillows were so comfy. Staff very friendly and helpful. Our highlight of the trip was the fantastic bar..their quirky staff made it a memorable experience. Location is superb, just round the corner from the dominion. Everything was spotlessly clean and well kept. A true luxury hotel experience! Will be returning! ",5,2016,11,20
115,Superb in all respects,"Second visit here, fantastic central location within strolling distance of WestEnd, theatres, Soho etc. Excellent decor, and attention to detail in all respects. Luxurious en-suite room, very efficient staff. Very good cooked breakfast included. Why look anywhere else",5,2016,11,20
115,Just exceptional!,"Just had a delightful one night stay. This hotel has many positives but one thing above all. OK, there's the location, the historic building, classy interiors, comfortable and well-equipped rooms, very good breakfast and atmospheric bar but the service and staff are the stars. Special mention to Estelita & Georgie who looked after us at breakfast but every single member of staff we encountered was attentive, professional and genuine. Everyone seems authorised to do whatever to deliver great customer service and justly proud of what they do. This is a really, really, well run hotel making for what Sid O has already called a most memorable experience. Will be back a.s.a.p.",5,2016,11,20
115,Afternoon Tea,"Called in for afternoon tea (a gift). Service was excellent and staff were attentive when you wished them to be. The meal composed a variety of sandwiches, scones and cakes  and was very enjoyable.

Did not stay so cannot rate the rooms.",5,2016,11,20
115,"Truly excellent Afternoon Tea, brilliant service!","Afternoon Tea at the Bloomsbury was a real treat. Excellent warm welcome, perfect food and brilliant service from Joao. He made us feel so welcome and nothing was too much trouble. One of the best Afternoon Teas I've had...and all down to the service. 

Booking the next visit soon.",5,2016,11,20
115,Very nice and comfortable,"The staff was excellent. Room and dining room service was really good.The hotel was very clean and safe. Great location close to shopping areas. A little pricey but worth every penny. 
Would highly recommend.",5,2016,11,18
115,Best in London!,"The Bloomsbury is the most memorable  hotel experience I have ever come across. From the beautiful decor to the welcoming staff and delicious food, there isn't a single fault to be found. Hidden down one of the quieter side streets in central London, I would recommend staying there and you too won't want to leave! ",5,2016,11,18
115,Fantastic London Break,Booked this break to celebrate my 65 Birthday and my official retirement Booked The Bloomsbury Hotel. Went to see the Bodyguard at the Dominion Theatre Followed by Lunch at the Savoy. To start our celebrations we booked First Class rail travel. Had a truly wonderful time my wife and I.,5,2016,11,18
115,A blooming marvelous hotel with stunning cellar bar in Bloomsbury,"Treat yourself to a hidden gem. The Bloomsbury Hotel is a gem. Delightful staff, wonderful styling and a hidden gem of cellar bar and outdoor screen in the summer. Fabulous Hotel in the centre of London. You're welcome :-)
",5,2016,11,17
115,Excellent as always,"I love the Bloomsbury, the staff are very friendly and welcoming, nothing is too much trouble. The location is fantastic, a very convenient base when on a trip to London. I stayed there with a friend last weekend and we enjoyed a fabulous dinner on the Dalloway Terrace which since being refurbished is beautiful. Our room was spacious and spotlessly clean, underfloor heating in the bathroom was lovely and breakfast in our room the next morning was frankly enormous. I don't want to recommend this hotel to everyone in case I can't get a room next time I want to stay!",5,2016,11,17
115,Amazing Dinner!!,"Excellent meal!  Excellent staff!  We did not stay at this property, but regretted not doing so.  We stayed at the Marriott Grosvenor House, but found the attention and service we received in one evening at the Bloomsbury far surpassed what we were receiving at the Grosvenor House.  The Bloomsbury will be our hotel of choice for our next visit to London!",5,2016,11,16
115,"Great rooms, service and food","We were very happy with our stay at the Bloomsbury. We had theater engagements and the location was great. It was also a quiet street, close to a tube station, Boots, and great restaurants. The lobby is very classy and the concierge and front desk attendants are very helpful and ready to serve. The room was just the right size and good for London. Comfy bed! And we weren't bothered by noise. The bathroom was very nice as well. While we were there the hot breakfast was limited for a couple days, but the buffet was delicious! Really great food and options.",5,2016,11,16
115,Always reliable ,"I have stayed here on several occasions in past few years and have always enjoyed my stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel. The Bloomsbury Club bar has great service and good cocktails. The rooms are clean and comfortable. It is superbly located, less than 5 minutes from Tottenham Court Road tube and really close to Soho, Chinatown and Covent Garden. ",4,2016,11,15
115,Very relaxing night in London,Great sense of occasion as you walk through the door. You are immediately made to feel special and important which is rare these days. There is also a lovely smell. Throughout my stay all the staff went beyond my expectations in making me feel welcome. Finally a hotel with proper sheets and feather pillows - luxuriant sleep! I literally couldn't fault it. ,5,2016,11,15
115,Fantastic hotel-amazing stuff,"We stayed for 5 nights with my daughter.The hotel is beautiful,the stuff is very freindly,they really care about everything.The breakfast was wonderful with fresh and healthy food.The room was clean and comfortable.I would like to say a big thank you for the stuff,especially for Sebastian and Julia to make our jouney unforgettable.",5,2016,11,15
115,Great choice of hotel,"As a family we went to london last weekend to see a show and wanted somewhere great to stay. We had afternoon tea at the Bloomsbury a few months ago, were impressed with the food quality and service so decided to stay here for this weekend break. I booked three rooms for my wife and I and the kids, great rooms with all the facilities one would need. Had afternoon tea again which was equally as good as before with great service and fine attention from all staff. Our evening meal was up to scratch as well as having a good nights sleep. A minor issue in the morning over breakfast was resolved thanks to Jaro at reception, he was a credit to the hotel. Would thoroughly recommend a stay here or even suggest you pop in for afternoon tea.",5,2016,11,15
115,MickJ,"Stayed here on a weekend in London. Fantastic hotel. Exceeded my expectations. The rooms are spacious,  (for London). Very relaxed atmosphere. Staff very helpful and friendly. Dale the doorman was very helpful and friendly, a great representative for the hotel. 
Would recommend this hotel to friends and family. Will definitely stay here again when in London.",5,2016,11,15
115,Hotel still pleases,My second visit this year went very well despite an itinerary that meant storing luggage as I went to Sicily and then Bath.  I enjoy this hotel enough to return at least once a year. Staff always excellent and hotel development since my first visit in 2008 is impressive.,5,2016,11,14
115,Fantastic,"Only spent one night here whilst visiting London to see a show and was blown away by the hotel. As soon as you arrive the staff are just brilliant, we never walked past a member of staff during our stay without them saying hello and checking everything was ok. 
The decor of the hotel is lovely especially the club bar downstairs. We had some cocktails in here which were delicious, the waitress thoroughly went through the cocktail menu with us, helping us pick something to our taste. 
Our room was beautiful and super clean, with a good selection of toiletries, iron, hairdryer, well stocked mini bar and complimentary water. When we arrived back from seeing a show, we noticed our room had been tidied and gowns were lay on the bed. 
We ordered room service and the food was brilliant, there is a 12.5% service charge on all food and drinks which I think is quite normal in London. 
The hotel is situated very central. 2 minutes walk away from oxford street and Tottenham Court Road tube station. 
This hotel is perfect, I would definitely recommend it to everyone and would 100% stay here again as and when I visit London. ",5,2016,11,14
115,Truly Welcoming Home Away From Home,"My mom and I had the most wonderful stay at The Bloomsbury. We were there for 3 nights and after 2 weeks of driving through Europe we were so happy to have a clean and comfy room to come home to. It was decorated beautifully (as was the stationary) and the staff was incredibly attentive and helpful without being pushy! The concierge arranged a car to take us to the airport and we did not have to worry about a thing. The front desk even mailed our postcards :) The room was a good size for a British hotel and the bed was so comfortable you just sunk in. Nespresso was a very nice touch and the toiletries were great. The hotel is centrally located near the British Museum, Covent Garden, the John Soane Museum and Soho. And you must try the charming patio for drinks in the evening. We loved everything about The Bloomsbury and enjoyed our time there immensely. It was a perfect end to our European vacation. Will definitely return! Great for a weekend or a week. In all honesty, I wouldn't mind living there it was so relaxing (thanks to the staff)!",5,2016,11,13
115,Old world service with new world efficiency.,"I love this charming, boutique hotel that originally was a women's club. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed, yet all distinctive. There is a terrific library filled with old books on the second floor. I found one that was a childhood favorite and when I asked if I could purchase it, the Bloomsbury staff gave it to me as a gift. I also enjoyed lunch in he enclosed terrace and am a huge fan of the lattes and  healthy smoothies served in the lobby area. ",5,2016,11,13
115,Weekend break ,Yet again this hotel is fantastic we stay here twice a year and this hotel never disappoints got upgraded to a deluxe room which was fabulous lots of space the staff and everyone who work there make you feel great the breakfast also really great will be back again sometime in February 17 ,5,2016,11,13
115,My Bloomsbury Weekend,"Excellent place to stay in London. Great facilities and superbly located for sightseeing. Very friendly staff, always extremely helpful. Rooms are of an excellent standard, clean and smelt fresh. Nothing was too much trouble and would have no problem 
",5,2016,11,13
115,Excellent choice for our weekend break,"All staff were very attentive, polite and helpful especially Julia on check in.Location was excellent close to Covent Garden, china town, travalger square, and Leicester Square. The hotel was of a very high standard and charming. Rooms were very clean and had complimentary tea, coffee and bottles of water, dressing gowns and slippers. Breakfast was excellent with a good selection including a full English. Special mention to Maria and Estelita for their wonderful service,couldn't fault it. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,11,11
115,Fantastic place Fantastic Staff.,"Stayed for 2 nights with my wife for a short visit to London to celebrate her birthday. We booked a queen double room. The room wasn't particularly large but suited what we wanted. It was always spotlessly clean and we got a night time turn down service both nights we were there. My only complaint of the room was the shower control knob in the bathroom was broken and it was difficult to try and turn the shower on and off.

We chose The Bloomsbury because of its close location to the Dominion Theatre and to Covent Garden etc. On both counts fantastic, literally around the corner from the theatre and 10 Minutes walk to  Covent Garden. 

The real positive we took from the hotel was the staff. Everyone we dealt with was incredibly polite and helpful. My wife even revived a birthday cake from the management one night when we returned to our room. A very nice touch we thought.

I would certainly recommend a visit to the Bloomsbury club bar for a drink on an evening. We visited for a night cap both days and had a great experience, again the staff were fantastic, unfortunately like most things in London, be prepared to pay for the privilege!

We will almost certainly return to the hotel in the future.",5,2016,11,08
115,Luxurious and comfortable,"The hotel is conveniently located at merely a two-minute walk from Tottenham Court Road tube station. I arrived an hour early but was checked in and was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded. 
The room itself is luxurious with complimentary (high-quality) selection of teas and a nespresso machine with a choice of 3 capsules. Indulged in their excellent afternoon tea before going out to explore the area. Returned to a turned down room-service. Bed is very comfortable, room-service is prompt, and the toiletry selection is excellent (Aromatherapy Associates!).
All in all a very pleasant and indulgent stay.",5,2016,11,07
115,Lovely and great stay!,"We have stayed at this hotel previously and were very happy to return. The location, cleanliness and most of all the staff with their  attention to detail and your needs will certainly make us want to return, A very comfortable and  ideal London location. ",5,2016,11,06
115,Mr Fox,"First time in the hotel and I wasn't disappointed. The staff were excellent from the first day to the last, they simply couldn't do enough. 
Rooms were on the little small side but let's face it, you don't spend much time in your room when your in the big cities of the world.
Definitely worth a visit, you won't be disappointed😁.",5,2016,11,06
115,Lovely stay at The Bloomsbury,"We stayed her for our Anniversary as our son had bought us tickets for The Bodyguard.  The hotel is great so quiet and comfortable.  Only dissapointment was we didn't book for the restaurant and they could only accommodate us after the show which was too late for us but we did have a snack in the bar which was really nice and a drink on the Terrace  after the show with another snack.  Room was small but very nice and very comfortable the bed was lovely and snug.
Definitely would recommend and stay her again its in a good location and the staff were brilliant.
I had got a swollen foot at breakfast and the manager in the restaurant gave me an icepack which helped no end.
Breakfast was superb so much choice and excellent value for money :)",4,2016,11,05
115,Great Hotel,"This hotel is wonderful. The staff actually enjoys the guests and does everything they can to make their stay great. The rooms are really nice and the entire hotel is 5 star elegant in a traditional way. The breakfast is an 8.5 out of 10 - really good for a hotel breakfast. And the food from room service is a 9/10. The location is great; 1 minute walk from the British Museum, 10-15 minutes from many theaters., 2-5 minutes from Foyles. We used to stay in five star hotels for business and pleasure but now only stay here. It is a find. ",5,2016,11,03
115,Excellent service,"The Bloomsbury is an excellent hotel. Typically for the Doyle Group, my room was comfortable, spotless and stylish and the staff were all extremely friendly and professional. They go out of this way to make you feel welcome. It's not the cheapest place to stay but is good value for money. The restaurant was very good too, with exemplary and friendly service. Highly recommended. ",5,2016,11,03
115,Attentive Staff and Great Atmosphere,"The hotel staff are fantastic, especially Maria at breakfast who remembers your name and Joel who is just a wonderful person and makes you feel like a VIP.  An oasis of calm in the centre of London with a great terrace and downstairs bar area",5,2016,11,02
115,Simply the best,"We have just returned from one night a this amazing hotel. I can not speak highly enough of it. From the moment our taxi pulled up outside the hotel the customer service was second to none. The location is perfect for shopping, theatre and convent garden. The room was lovely, the bed was one of the most comfortable I had ever slept on, and the room was quiet. We had a cocktail in the hotel after the theatre and the staff made us so welcome talking me through the cocktails could have spent many hours there! We left our luggage at the hotel all day on our second day and when we returned at 6.30 the lovely concierge sorted a taxi to the train station for us. Thank you to all the staff for making our stay so great - we can't wait to return.",5,2016,11,02
115,"10 out of 10, here's why","1 - If you're travelling from the north, arriving at either Euston or Kings Cross you can   walk quicker than a taxi.
2 - The hotel is situated in Bloomsbury, which is one of the nicer parts of London to stay.
3 - The hotel is so well placed for so many places that you would want to visit, again all within walking distance.
4 - There are lots of restaurants in the local area, catering for all tastes.
5 - The building itself is wonderful.
6 - The rooms are well furnished and very comfortable.
7- Breakfast is delicious and IT IS SERVED TO ORDER, so no cold food that has been in a buffet tray fro several hours.
8 - The warmth of the welcome
9 - The attention to detail
10 - The staff.  The quality of service provided by the staff at this hotel is exceptional.  Everyone we met was friendly, helpful and really professional in making sure that we had a great stay.

We have stayed at many hotels in London but the Bloomsbury is the best we have stayed at.  There are cheaper options but for a balance of quality and cost we would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,11,01
115,Great hotel in the heart of London,"I have stayed at this exquisite boutique hotel on a number of occasions for business. The hotel is perfectly situated, easily reachable and the ambience is just superb. The new downstairs bar area and patio had added tremendous value. The rooms are of a high standard and most of all nice & quiet - away from the hustle & bustle of the city. The staff are courteous and extremely helpful, especially Maria & Alaeddine who always look after me so well when having one of the delicious Bloomsbury breakfasts. I would highly recommend this hotel, whether staying for business or pleasure. Sean Thomson",5,2016,10,31
115,Weekend Getaway,"Just back from a night at the Bloomsbury.  Service was exceptional, and all staff, from check in, to the concierge to the staff at breakfast, could not do enough to help.  We stayed in a superior queen room: pleasant, clean and comfortable.  It was a compact room, which you come to expect in London - but it was a bit of a squeeze getting past the chair at the desk to the far side of the bed.  And this is not the smallest room at the hotel.  Location is great, just a 2 minute walk from Tottenham Court Road tube, and not far to Leicester Square, Soho, Covent Garden.",4,2016,10,31
115,Group visit ,"This is our second time at The Bloomsbury. Here with a group from Goodspeed Musicals in East Haddam CT. Wonderful location, easily walkable to most theatres, Covent Gardens, Trafalgar Sq. 
 Very comfortable room, wonderful accommodating staff. Great breakfast buffet. ",5,2016,10,30
115,Highly recommended,"This is a lovely, elegant, upscale hotel, tastefully decorated in accordance with its history. The beautiful lobby bar is a relaxing place for an evening cocktail or a sumptuous high tea. Our room was small but very comfortable and pretty, and also nice and quiet. The bathroom was lovely, although I found the lighting a little too subdued for doing makeup. The staff were all very pleasant, especially the two concierges we dealt with who were both really helpful. Best of all is the fabulous location in the heart of the West End - close to the British Museum, the theatres, Covent Garden and the Tottenham Court Road tube station.",5,2016,10,30
115,Better than expected,"Seven of us staying overnight for business and we will do so again. Very pleasant staff, room was plenty good enough and most of all it was quiet in the room, quite an achievement for the middle of London.",4,2016,10,29
115,"Beautifully designed hotel, lovely staff","We loved The Bloomsbury - the room was spacious with many well-considered design touches, like the wall-mounted reading lights on both sides of the bed, automatic closet lights, both a coffee maker and a kettle, plenty of storage space for clothes and bags, and a very comfortable bed with lovely linens.  The staff was exceedingly gracious and helpful, and the food was excellent.  Also, the renovation of an historic building was done with taste and care.  Location is great for the British Museum and Covent Garden shopping and restaurants.  ",5,2016,10,28
115,The Bloomsbury is a fantastic choice,"Have stayed here multiple times.  Excellent customer service.   Rooms are comfortable, nice amenities and staff's attention to detail is always appreciated.  For business, I stay in that section of London often, and this is now my top choice. ",4,2016,10,28
115,Great location. Excellent value,Beautifully restored hotel in the West End. Convenient for theatres and musems. Staff are helpful and the hotel provides comfortable and clean accommodation at a reasonable price for the location.  Second time we have stayed. We prefer rooms at the rear of the hotel as they are away from any traffic.,5,2016,10,27
115,A gem,"My husband has stayed at this lovely hotel several times for business, a first stay for me.  What a wonderful experience!  The staff greeted us warmly upon arrival and could not do enough to make sure we were very well take care of.  A special mention for Moritz at the front desk who made sure our room was perfect, and thanks to Andrea and Joel at the lovely outdoor terrace restaurant and bar ... a great spot with perfect service and hospitality.

The hotel is beautifully appointed... good sized rooms, really comfortable bed, gorgeous bathroom with  plentiful amenities, lots of wonderful touches. Our suite was on the 6th floor, extremely quiet.  

An excellent value for the quality of the hotel and staff! We look forward to our return!!",5,2016,10,27
115,A Wonderful Stay,"We recently stayed at The Bloomsbury and without a doubt will be staying there again on our next visit to London.  We chose this hotel because of tripadvisor reviews.  We were not disappointed.  The location, the staff, service and ambience.....perfect!  Rooms are tastefully decorated, quiet with soundproof windows.  The bathrooms are gorgeous, with heated tile floors.  We particularly enjoyed the main floor lobby lounge where guests may order drinks, afternoon tea and light meals.  Candlelight in the evening makes this space magical and so inviting.  The breakfast buffet was superb, probably the nicest we have ever encountered.  The hotel's location is perfect for walking to theatre venues and for exploring central London.  We have no hesitation at all in recommending this hotel!",5,2016,10,26
115,Very well cared for,"We only stayed here for one night, but it was amazing. We had a luxury room, the bed was huge, the en suite had a walk in shower and a stand alone bath. After seeing the room we opted to spend the night in rather than going out in town.
We had cocktails at the bar, had wine glasses and a bottle opener bought to our room along with some late night food, and we made full use of the hotel breakfast. All of which were served by lovely, friendly staff - Estelita and Judith in the restaurant were wonderful and really added to the enjoyment of our meal.
Overall we had a really great stay and were very sad to leave. Very recommended, even if you're not staying there, you should check out the bar - it's a lovely place to have cocktails.",5,2016,10,26
115,Excellent stay,"I have stayed in many hotels over the years but this has been one of the best.
Great location for everything,  really helpful and friendly staff nothing too much trouble.
Hotel itself is attractive in all areas, conservatory gorgeous and bar really quirky and typical of a tasteful London bar. We loved all the candles which gave off a lovely smell as you entered the hotel.  
It was all the little extra touches that made it even more special, express coffee machine in the room, robes and slippers. Excellent breakfast and a bottle of water offered to us on our check out.
Would definitely recommend and will stay there again.
T",5,2016,10,26
115,Nice hotel if you are in the right room,"I was originally booked into room 215, which was not only noisy from the room next door where I could pretty much overhear the conversation, there was also noise from the Terrace downstairs coming up and additionally cigarette smoke from the Terrace was smellable in this room. The team at the front desk kindly exchanged my room and moved me into 603 wich was a much better and much quieter experience, thank you very much for arranging this!",4,2016,10,26
115,Great stay!,"Lovely hotel in a great location. Business trip organised for me. Great location in a nice area with good access to lovely restaurants and shops. My room was standard however was very clean and comfortable - I had a good nights sleep!
Staff were very welcoming - would visit again.",4,2016,10,25
115,Probably the best place to stay in London,"If you are to write the pros and cons of staying in this hotel, The Bloomsbury will have all the pros: reasonable price, very central location close to the tube and walking distance to places of interest like the British Museum, lots of shops and dining places on Oxford Street (the restaurants at the hotel serve delicious food, too), and a wonderful staff from the reception to the concierge to the restaurant staff. Special mention goes to Estelita Bueno and of course to Maria and Maya for taking very good care of our Filipino group. Hospitality at its best.",5,2016,10,22
115,Very small standard rooms,"We are a family of 4 (3 adults and 1 toddler) and at the recommendation of a friend, booked the Bloomsbury for our stay. They do not have family rooms so we reserved through a hotel website 2 standard rooms with 1 room requesting a baby cot and the other requesting twin bed. As it turns out we were given 2 rooms with queen size bed as they said standard rooms do not have twin beds. As I requested a cot for the toddler they were kind enough to upgrade my daughter and grandson to a superior room without extra charge. But the standard room that my husband and I stayed was really small. I requested for switch to superior room and pay the difference but the hotel was full for the period of our stay. Their closet was flat and shallow so you need to hang your suit facing outwards and no more than 3 sets. There were no chest of drawers for clothes. The toilet had no space to put toiletries apart from that little space behind the bowl which had to be really careful as the toiletries might drop into the toilet bowl. We could hardly open a big suitcase at any available walking space in the room. On the good side, the hotel is conveniently located near the tube and within walking distance to Soho, Convent Garden and the big bookstore Foyles at Charing Cross Road. ",3,2016,10,22
115,Fantastic stay!,Wonderful boutique hotel in the heart of the Soho neighborhood.  Beautiful and charming spot -- great location.  Very reasonably priced.  Great service.  Nothing to critique.  I'd highly recommend it and would come back.,5,2016,10,21
115,Poor anniversary experience,"We arrived last week to the Bloomsbury hotel to celebrate our first anniversary (we notified the hotel in advance about the anniversary), and I can say I hope the next anniversaries will take place at better hotels. 

We thought we are going to get a nice room with some kind of gift or a card for our anniversary. Instead, we entered a room which is for one person at most, and even that is a borderline definition as one can bump his head standing in the bathroom that has a lower ceiling on it's side. The bed was single and a half in it's size. No place for 2 people whatsoever on that bed. This is unacceptable by any standard. I was told that this is London idea of double room, but I've been to London before and it wasn't anything like it. I slept no more than 3 hours that night. Not a great way to start your vacation. 
The room felt like a dungeon with that tiny window that looks no where. Tiny closet.
I've been to dozens of hotels and never came across anything like this room.

On the next night we paid to get a slightly better room which was ok.

Another disappointment was the lack of interest to us celebrating anniversary, even though we mentioned that to the hotel 3 times (twice by mail and one time in person).

On the positive side - The location is very good. The upgraded room was ok. Some of the staff are nice.",2,2016,10,21
115,Great Stay in a great location,"A  very pleasant 4 night stay at the Bloomsbury.  Location was excellent for Covent Garden, the theatres, shopping and some of the museums. Room was well furnished but somewhat small - perhaps normal for central London.
Hopefully we will stay again.",4,2016,10,18
115,Lovely hotel in an interesting area of London,"My husband and I spent three nights at The Bloomsbury in August, and it's the first of 5 or 6 hotels where we've stayed in London that we'd definitely go back to.  Our room was just large enough and very nicely appointed.  All of the staff people we encountered were friendly and helpful, and we very much enjoyed drinks in The Bloomsbury Club Bar and dinner on the Dalloway Terrace.  For architecture fans like myself, the fact that the building was designed (as a YWCA) by Edwin Lutyens is a plus. And we enjoyed being in Bloomsbury, just down the street from the British Museum and within walking distance of theaters, the Inns of Court area, and other interesting places.",5,2016,10,17
115,Lovely,"Very central, very close to the tube, walking distance to lots of places, restaurants, shopping,  GREAT, great, housekeeping (a big thank you to the team), very good dinner but a bit chilly on the terrace.",4,2016,10,17
115,Great hotel,"We stayed at The Bloomsbury for 4 nights. 
It's in a fantastic location, just minutes away from Tottenham Court Rd tube station.
The bar has a great ambience and we enjoyed a few drinks.

I used the gym and whilst it is fairly small, it has all I needed for some upper body weights and general cardio.

The Malted Shake from the juice bar was delicious, certainly recommended after a workout....

The only thing that I didn't like was outside noise but that's part of a big city I guess.",4,2016,10,17
115,Great location and value ,"This hotel is in a super location, minutes from Covent Garden and Oxford Street.  The staff were all very friendly. The bedroom was a little small and the toiletries are lacking. No conditioner or body lotion. I phoned to request conditioner and was told twice it was on its way but never arrived. Lovely to have breakfast included at such a reasonably priced London hotel. The breakfast had a great variety of cold buffet and you could also order cooked breakfast. 
I would definitely return to this hotel. ",5,2016,10,16
115,Quality stay,"Stayed with my partner for theatre break. Ideal location, staff lovely and helpful. room clean and tidy. Recommend highly. We only wish we could have stayed longer, just wish the cost was a little less",5,2016,10,16
115,Treated as second class guest for booking through an agency website,"We booked our stay through an agency website as we could get the room we wanted significantly cheaper this way. We booked a deluxe room with king size bed but when we arrived, the bed in the room was significantly smaller - demonstrated by the fact the bed was much narrower than the panelled bed head. We were effectively told that because we had booked via a third party, the hotel could do nothing to help to provide the bed we had booked",2,2016,10,13
115,My great experience at Bloomsbury hotel,"I visited the hotel for a coffee on Tuesday , as I drunk my coffee, a hotel host called Philippo came to ask me if everything was OK. I said yes, then I thought I'd have something to eat and he brought the menu and I have asked for suggestions on what to eat and drink. 

Is not what Philippo did, it is how he did it with such kind and accommodating manners.
Bloomsbury is a lovely hotel but that kind of service adds extra stars to the experience. 

Thanks Philippo",4,2016,10,12
115,Top Notch in every way!,"I stayed at The Bloomsbury with my mum on a special treat weekend to London, and this hotel made the experience wonderful! From the moment we arrived we were greeted by friendly helpful staff. Every member we met went out of their way to make us feel welcome and nothing was too much trouble. 
We stayed in room 306 a perfectly positioned room close to the lifts, but tucked away lovely and quiet. The rooms are of a very high standard with high end toiletries, robes, nespresso machine. A lovely plate of fruit welcoming us to the hotel from Sebastian - Thank You.
The air conditioning/heating was very efficient, I find some hotels too hot but this system worked brilliantly and quickly got the room to our preferred temp. 
Beds extremely comfortable and the room furnishing were just beautiful.
Our room was ready when we arrived early (11.30am) which was very much appreciated and meant we could settle into our room and start enjoying our weekend.
We dined in the hotels Galloway Terrace restaurant in the evening and what a delight that was, the staff, the setting, the food and the wine were all fantastic, it was such a lovely experience, neither of us could fault anything.
In the morning we had breakfast in the dining room - again met with a warm friendly welcome, a huge choice of buffet items plus menu items made to order - fantastic.
One other much appreciated thing was check out - it wasn't until 12 midday! This meant we could do a visit to the museum and go back to the hotel to freshen up before heading out for the rest of our day. Once checked out we left our luggage safely at the hotel and returned later to collect it before heading back to Euston, the concierge staff were so helpful organising a taxi for us and even carried our luggage down the road to the waiting taxi (we left it a little late so they really pulled out all the stops to ensure we got to the station on time 
The hotel itself is situated in a great spot, just a minutes walk from the British Museum. 5 minutes to the Phoenix Theatre, which is where our show was, and just 10 minutes to Covent Garden. You have the choice of dining out and about as there are an abundance of cafes and restaurants in the immediate vicinity, but we were very pleased with our decision to stay within the hotel.
All in all it made our trip perfect! So a huge Thank You to all the lovely staff at the Bloomsbury and congratulations on having such a beautiful, well run hotel. I look forward to a return visit and would highly recommend without hesitation.",5,2016,10,12
115,Super location,"I was in London for a few days business and found this hotel very convenient for my meetings.  Great neighborhood for walking, close to Soho and just a street or so over from the high traffic areas.   My room was large and well appointed but a colleague was in a room about half the size for the same price and same nights. Be sure to request a larger room! ",4,2016,10,12
115,Another business trip,"Stay here quite often but it's always worth pointing out the the service is consistently good. 
Have got into the habit of asking for a room quite high up in the hotel as due to its popularity it naturally gets quite busy in the restaurants and bars downstairs; but staff are great & breakfast always excellent. Fast wifi and sky sports in the rooms top it all off.",5,2016,10,12
115,Excellent stay at The Bloomsbury,"I stayed at the Bloomsbury for 4 nights in September. I spent a lot of time researching hotels in London and ultimately am very happy that I booked at The Bloomsbury. 

Service:
Everyone at the front desk was incredibly helpful and friendly throughout our stay, despite there being a very large pharma conference happening concurrently. The hotel was filled to the brim but everyone remained calm, collected, and welcoming throughout. 

When we initially checked in, we were given a courtyard-facing room, which was a bit on the dark side. We asked at the front desk if we could switch rooms, and they were able to find us a exterior room for the remaining 3 nights of our stay. 

Room:
We stayed in the Superior Queen room and found it to be very spacious. The style of the room is a nice blend of classic + modern, everything had a nice timeless, crisp, and clean aesthetic without feeling too stuffy/old. Amenities were plentiful, including bathrobes, slippers, and a coffee/tea/biscuit station (which we enjoyed every morning). The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was modern with good water pressure. Daily housekeeping did a fantastic job keeping things fresh and clean, and daily turndown service is a nice touch as well. 

Location:
The hotel is extremely central, and literally a block from the British Museum. The closest tube station is Tottenham, which is a very busy station but also very convenient. While the surrounding area is bustling, the actual street the hotel is on is actually quite quiet. We mostly walked everywhere, and were within 10-20 min from all the main attractions, and were able to see pretty much all of central London on foot. 

Dining:
We didn't have a chance to try the high tea, but seems like a fun experience if you get the chance. They'll bring it to your room if you like!

Overall: 
While a bit expensive for those looking to keep their travel expenses down (ended up being around ~$300 USD/nt), compared to what you get for $250 USD/nt at other chain hotels in central London, The Bloomsbury is worth the extra expense to ensure you have a flawless stay while on vacation. They really pay attention to details, have all the services/amenities/conveniences of a larger hotel chain while retaining that feel of a small boutique hotel.",5,2016,10,12
115,"Fine elegance, top notch staff.","We spend four nights, and were well cared for, the restaurant provided a wonder breakfast each morning. On our last day we tea in the lobby, my first tea experience exceeded my expectations. 

The location is probably the best in London, just down the block from the British Museum and out of the busy area. We were in walking distance of all attractions, and a block from a Tube station on in-climate days.",5,2016,10,12
115,A lovely London Treat,"We loved EVERYTHING about The Bloomsbury;  the location, the warm welcome
every time we walked in the door, the lovely room and, especially,  beginning each
day with Eggs Florentine served by the charming Filippo on the entrancing Dalloway Terrace.  It was hard to say goodbye to The Bloomsbury.  I'll certainly be back
there as soon as I can.",5,2016,10,12
115,Afternoon tea,"The afternoon tea was amazing!

Fillipo booked an table at the Terrace for me. After arrival my mom wanted to sit outside. Fillipo arranged this for us. After his welcome with the champagne we enjoyed the afternoon tea. One of the best so far. He even packed some scones as a suprise for my mom on her way back to the airport.

Thanks!",5,2016,10,11
115,Such a place of comfort and history!,"The hotel staff all are obviously a team intended to make everyone feel like a king or queen.  Impeccable service at every step.  And what a lovely gracious restored old hotel.  Most everything we needed was made available.  We even encountered a few ""trainees"" -- but they had good managers who patiently showed them how to accommodate needs of guests.  Everyone looked out for any need we may seem to have.  Hard to leave the caring environment.",5,2016,10,10
115,Will stay here again,We stayed at two hotels in London and one in Paris on this trip and this was by far my favorite.  The lobby and rooms were beautiful and the staff were accommodating.  The room was very clean and the linens were top notch.  The only downfall was the lighting in our room was very dim.  Hard to do your makeup but I can look past that. The breakfast buffet was delicious and offered quite a large selection.  Great location for the theatre area.  ,5,2016,10,10
115,Absolutely wonderful!,"You never know what you're going to get when traveling abroad, and the Bloomsbury was a blessing for our honeymoon stay!  Couldn't say enough about the extremely accommodating and knowledgeable staff, the fun and exciting location,  the brilliant decor, and the spacious room.  Doesn't look like much from the front, but don't underestimate it.  Located close to shopping, theaters, British museum, etc.  ",5,2016,10,10
115,Terrific Service,"From the front desk to the downstairs bar the entire staff was awesome! Friendly, courteous and efficient. If you love old fashioned cocktails them the downstairs bar will be your favorite spot. Location close to theatre district / Leicester Square and close to the tube. A Beautiful hotel with a terrific restaurant. One fallback... a long walk to River Thames/ Clock Tower. ",4,2016,10,10
115,"Friendly, modern hotel with character ","My husband and I stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel for two nights as it was ideally located for the Dominion Theatre where we had reservations for The Body Guard. On arrival we were greeted warmly, the room was lovely and clean with modern facilities. All the staff from Receptionists to the cleaning staff and waiters were friendly, making a point of saying hello. We enjoyed their breakfast and also had a drink in the cocktail bar one evening where a jazz band played. A lovely environment. The hotel isn't far from Euston station and the closest tube is Tottenham Court Road. We would recommend. ",5,2016,10,09
115,Special place to stay,Stayed for my daughter's birthday. We told the man on the desk we were seeing Les Miserables. Came back to this....the fantastic service made the whole trip really special. Breakfast was really good. Every member of staff was really welcoming and thoughtful.,5,2016,10,09
115,Lovely visit,Just spent a second visit at the Bloomsbury. After 2 years great to see its still as good. As a single traveller I felt safe and comfortable not always possible in the city. The staff were lovely very friendly and made time to talk to me. The waitress at Dalloway terrance when I had my solo afternoon tea was really attentive and helpfull as was the waiter for my solo breakfast in the lounge today. I can recommend the express breakfast if full English isn't your thing. The only negative was being briefly woken by the bins being emptied at 6am but I had asked for a street view. Hopefully it won't be another 2 years before I return.,5,2016,10,07
115,Bloomsbury Hotel,"The hotel staff was very kind and helpful.
The room was clean and comfort.
The breakfast was repeated itself every day because there was not much to select from.
The location is perfect. Close to a tube station and the beginning of oxford street.",5,2016,10,07
115,Best location + Best service = Best experience!,"We came with high expectations after reading all reviews, and found that it was even better! Starting with warm welcome and continues feeling that we are the most important guests in the hotel. Breakfast was much better than typical breakfast in the center of London, room was welcoming, clean and nicely decorated. Location is the best you can get, right in the center, 1 mn away from British museum and dominion theatre, 5 mn from Piccadilly circus, Leicester square, or Oxford street. It was the first time we checked out London hotel with a big smile and big will to come back soon!",5,2016,10,07
115,Beautiful Bloomsbury,"Hotel is really beautiful, décor and ambience and staff completely charming, upgraded on arrival is always a good start, although the room was small but everything you need, not too sure about the frosted bathroom door though, and a shame there was no storage cupboard to fit the ironing board in.  Afternoon tea with champagne was divine.  Dinner that night was good, apart from forgetting to bring out one of my sides, in the end it did arrive and I did not pay for it, but not the point.  Breakfast Sunday was hectic but without the smoothness and efficiency of the rest of the hotel, tea didn't turn up for ages we kept getting asked but nothing arrived and then 2 pots at once! just little things but really annoying.  Breakfast Monday morning was like a different hotel, it was charming and calm.  Overall a lovely hotel with a couple of hiccups, but would stay again.  Also good location.",5,2016,10,06
115,High Quality Hotel,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for one night with breakfast. The level of service was excellent by all staff throughout the building. The hotel is beautiful and the breakfast was superb. 
Sincere thanks go to Sebastian for arranging a complimentary room upgrade and fruit plate (which my girlfriend loved), as I had informed him that this was a special occasion before I leave the country for a year with work.
Hotel is great value for money, highest level of standard and service, in a great location. Highly recommend.

",5,2016,10,04
115,Amazing ,"Stayed here for 2 nights. Upgraded on arrival. Lovely room, quite small but well presented. Hotel had a great ambience. Ideal location for walking to lots of attractions. We went to the theatre  which was about 20 mins walk, given directions and a map by a very helpful concierge. 
Spent more  than we usually  would on accommodation but the weekend was a treat. Also went to Ronnie Scotts  jazz club this is only about 8 mins walk so hotel well placed for jazz enthusiasts. 
Only negative - breakfast expensive  at £18.50 normally  £26! So many cafes in walking distance so would advise go out for breakfast. ",5,2016,10,04
115,The best Hotel in London,"We were going to the Phoenix theatre, and was looking for somewhere close to Shaftesbury Ave, and Leicester Square, We booked it online, and found it very easy,
We arrived on Saturday morning (1st Oct 2016) and were greeted right outside, we were shown where to book in, and offered a hot flannel to refresh our hands, (Wow!! Never ever been offered that before, lovely touch that was), The first thing that greets you is the unbelievable staff greeting, so friendly and courteous,
We was offered a upgrade as they found out it was our 44th wedding anniversary, they gave us room 802 and was it lovely, Oh yes it was!! Very very clean, with every thing you could possibly want,
We came down for drinks and relax before heading off to Leicester Sq, The service was brilliant, and the atmosphere was just right, We went out to the show at night, then came back to the Hotel, where we was tempted to try a cocktail, we had a great night then,
In the morning we came down for breakfast, where the service was first class, and what we liked about it was, they cooked the English breakfast and brought it to your table, none of this going and lifting lids to see what was inside, and with a good level of staff on, every thing was very quickly brought to our table, we loved that !!
I must say here and now, we have stayed in several Hotels in London, but none compare to this one,
When we were going home, there was two ladys on reception (Pip and Mariam) who thanked us for staying there, and offered us discount on our next trip to London to stay at the Bloomsbury,
ALL staff were really lovely and went out of there way to make our stay enjoyable!!
The show was brilliant, but the hotel was Fantastic!!!",5,2016,10,03
115,Fantastic experience,"Stayed at The Bloomsbury (on Great Russell) at the tail end of a 2-week family trip.  London can be a bit of a challenge to find really nice hotels in good locations that also offer fairly reasonable rates. 
This was the loveliest of finds and my family was so impressed with it that they decided to forego their plan to check out more than one neighborhood and instead completed their entire London stay at The Bloomsbury. 
The hotel is wonderfully appointed. You feel like you are taking a step into 1930s elegance, but with all the modern comforts.  Beautiful lobby, terrace, and bars...wonderful rooms with lots of space and excellent bathrooms. 
The staff are the best part...warm, gracious, and attentive.  Service is what makes this place even more special. 
The coolest touch is the little book left on the nightstand which details the history of this lovely hotel. Worth the read, and worth a great review. ",5,2016,10,01
115,Excellent for London visit,"We stayed for five nights and enjoyed the large room, which was quiet and had excellent air conditioning.  The size and comfort of the room for the price were far superior to the value of hotels we considered on the west end.  The staff were excellent.",5,2016,09,30
115,Business visit,A home from home in the centre of London. The staff are warm and friendly and nothing is too much trouble especially for the redoubtable Estelita who makes sure your breakfast experience is second to none.,5,2016,09,30
115,The Bloomsbury Hotel,"We recently returned for our fourth visit to The Bloomsbury Hotel and were not disappointed.  We greatly enjoyed our stay and will return on any future visit to London.  The hotel is lovely and convenient, and the staff is friendly and accommodating. ",5,2016,09,29
115,Our stay,"We found the Bloomsbury perfect for us and the couples traveling with us. The concierge and his staff were very courteous, knowledgeable and capable. The breakfast room staff were very friendly and very service oriented.  This hotel met all our expectations.",5,2016,09,28
115,Still a great hotel,We stayed here last year and loved it.  It was almost equally good this year.  One drawback was breakfast because of work being done in the kitchen. The rooms are lovely and the hotel is perfectly located near Tottenham Court Rd tube station and Oxford St.    Bar and restaurant are both good.,4,2016,09,27
115,Great conference venue,This was a great place to hold an event. Good location as is just 3 mins walk from Tottenham Court Road tube and lovely building. The buffet lunch is served I'm the restaurant with hotel guests and the food as amazing-much better than the usual sandwich buffet. Toilets very clean and staff were very friendly. Would definitely book here again.,4,2016,09,27
115,Just Not Sure.....,"An interesting hotel; to be honest I booked this hotel by accident as I thought I was booking The Bloomsbury Street Hotel which is nearby (having stayed there previously).

Architecture is interesting & the building certainly has a lot of character, that alone however doesn't make for a great &/or elegant hotel. The service in & around the reception/foyer area just isn't there. I have stayed at lesser hotels were the conduct & service levels are far better. 

Please avoid booking a standard room if your travelling as a couple, consider a larger room. The  standard rooms are small & there really isn't sufficient space for 2 adults to lodge comfortably, more so if you have a lot of luggage. The bathroom is just a shower room & very cramped. That said perhaps my room was just a one off as there was also rust in the shower drain.

The standard room is perfect for a short stay for 1 adult.

Stylish public rooms for relaxing in & the restaurant /bar areas are quite lovely.

Location is fantastic.

I just don't think this hotel quite hits the mark in some respects.",3,2016,09,26
115,Fantastic location ,"This is an exquisite hotel , from the moment you walk in you feel relaxed an calm .the smell of the fragrant candles burning were fresh and soothing especially returning from shopping in busy Oxford street which is literally yards away . The staff look extremely smart and are pleasant and very attentive . The bedroom was classically beautiful . although compact it  had everything you need and exceptionally clean  . The mini bar was a tad expensive but that is a personal choice of whether you buy or not , the prices are given clearly on the menu . Unfortunately we did nt try the restaurant ( we will try it on the next visit ) it appeared to be busy , but did nt disturb us in anyway . 
   The location of this hotel is fabulous , you are in  walking distance to Covent Garden , the British museum , Carnaby street , soho and china town . All great places to visit and shop . The underground links are great too . All in all an excellent experience , this hotel is by no way the cheapest , but in this case you clearly get what you pay for and I would definitely pay it again . A beautiful hotel incased in a beautiful building , I highly recommend it . ",5,2016,09,25
115,First Class Hotel,"First class hotel in every respect - the rooms, the staff, the facilities , the breakfast, the bars (I could go on) cannot be faulted. Definitely made our long weekend in London all the more pleasurable.",5,2016,09,25
115,Pleasant Stay,"We spent 11 days in the King Studio Suite which is a nice size 430 sq ft room. We had requested an early 12:00 check in if possible- the room was ready by about 12:30. The room is exactly as described on the hotel's website (with the exception of the fresh flowers). The air conditioning worked very well and the mattress was very comfortable. The room was always clean and ready when we returned from our day. 
The charging ports for phones, Ipads etc at the desk are a nice touch - we didn't need to use our adapters so it's less likely to lose them. The bathroom however did not have a G type electrical outlet anywhere which meant that the hairdryer provided by the hotel had to be plugged into an outlet on the desk which was a bit inconvenient. The bathroom does have an electrical outlet (ungrounded) for 110V and 250V if you do bring your own dryer with an ungrounded plug.  No ice machines, but that is typical and you can order ice brought up if you need it. The Wi Fi in the room was consistently good and there are computers and a printer available in the lobby to print out hard copies of anything you might need. 
The concierge, Brian Murphy was an absolute gem and his care and attention certainly added to our enjoyment of our stay. Maria and her staff gave us a warm welcome and personal attention (especially Georgi) every morning at breakfast.
The only real issue we had during the stay was with the room service - it was rare to get them to answer the phone on the first attempt which was a little frustrating. One order got lost - the hotel apologized the next day with a nice note and a bottle of wine. 
On the whole, it was a very enjoyable stay.",4,2016,09,25
115,Beautifully presented,"We booked last minute and didn't read reviews. I think mine will reflect what lots of people are saying.

Beautiful building, friendly welcoming staff. Perfectly situated for Dominion Theatre and Shaftesbury Theatre.

Our room was small but perfectly fitted out. Everything you need in there. We didn't realise how thin the walls were till our neighbour came in at 1.30am and made a 20 min call on loud speaker! It also appeared that any water he used (shower/toilet), sent the flush through the pipes in our room. Then refill and high pitched shrill. Not noticeable daytime though.

We ate at the hotel, afternoon tea outside. Perfect (although I did chase up the jam, cream and a spoon). Love the setting.  

Late night in the basement bar 👌🏻. Breakfast. Did have to chase up a glass of water twice but all very nice nevertheless.

All in all a lovely stay (minus the 1.30 racket). Would I recommend it, yes! Just hope you get quiet neighbours.",4,2016,09,25
115,luxurious hotel in central London,"Hotel cool, chic and luxurious hotel in central London. 2 minute walk to the theater (The Bodyguard) TUBE station and Oxford Street.
Staff are cheerful, helpful and very courteous.
Bright rooms, maid cleaning the rooms, and luxurious capsules Nespresso coffee machine - twice a day. General cleaning afternoon and evening preparing the bedroom.
Very tasty breakfast welcome by request from the menu, the staff in the dining room  DANELA & ESTELITA very helpful and takes care not to miss nothing.
In short, this is very very very very recommended !!!
We are sure we return",5,2016,09,25
115,I'm sorry.......disappointing,"Paying nearly £300 per room for 3 rooms in a top rated hotel I expected something special. But we left with a feeling of disappointment.

Staff 5/5 very helpful pleasant uniformly

Location 5/5 close to Oxford street, the theatre district and Tottenham Court Road tube. Quiet.

Rooms 2/5. Disappointing we had 3 superior rooms all with restricted head room. The shower area nooks and crannies needed steam cleaning. The shower glass was loose. The bed was great and the redeeming feature. We were not wowed with our room.

Breakfast 1/5. A disaster. I recently stayed at a Premier Inn which cooks a la carte and costs £8.50 it was better! The orders were delivered incorrectly. Only once at the beginning were we offered coffee in a one hour breakfast. We had to try and grab a frazzled waitress to ask for a refill. The eggs, which were in all our a la carte breakfasts were cold and over cooked. The cooked breakfast a la carte did not include smoked salmon and was limited. The display in the buffet area was underwhelming. The rolls and croissants were the mini ones which you buy frozen and heat up. Yuck yuck yuck! We were asked 30 minutes after eating if our cooked element was ok not soonafter beginning to eat it. The toast was barely cooked and cold.
Breakfast was offered at discount on arrival from £26 to £18.50.... I wonder why???
This area Bloomsbury is in serious need of a raised standard and fell far below an offering for a 4 star hotel.",2,2016,09,25
115,Amazing Find,"We spent 5 nights here in early September and this is an amazing find! Everything was perfect! The rooms, the service, the restaurant & bar. It truly was one of the nicest places we've ever stayed. Location was easy for walking, as well as the tube & bus. We found treats in our room when returning from a full day of touring. What could be better? The Bloomsbury is a beautiful hotel! ",4,2016,09,23
115,Plush,"I am actually only reviewing The Terrace bar at the side of the Hotel where my friend and I went for a drink and snack.

We were looked after very well by the gentleman Filipino waiter.   We were provided with tasteful blankets when the air became cooler.  We enjoyed the ambience.  However we ordered cheese plate and it took 20 minutes to come.  Then it was very small for £9 with 2 very small pieces of bread.  A few small bites of cheese and very thin.  This was disappointing and mean I thought.  Poor value for money.  Quality good.  Grapes excellent!

The hotel interior was very tasteful and staff exceptional.  Shame about the food!",4,2016,09,23
115,Wonderful breakfast celebration ,"We stayed at The Bloomsbury in July and wanted to stay again but unfortunately the hotel was fully booked.  We decided to return for breakfast to celebrate my husband's birthday and my daughter's university send-off. The food was as good as we remembered. The warm spinach salad with poached egg is my all time fave. Appreciated it very much, Chef Paul O'Brian. Despite the bustle, Estelita and Maria did not fail to attend to our needs. I cannot say enough of the warm and very attentive service we encountered here. Thank you Bloomsbury. ",5,2016,09,21
115,Weekend jaunt,"The experience is personal and friendly service, a good clean environment everywhere, a good atmosphere with people coming and going thought the lounge area and chatting quietly.

The room was fine - smaller than some yet if you're mainly there for sleeping and breakfast this is not an issue.  The staff switched to non-feather pillows / duvet (I forgot to state when booking and they wee quick to remedy).

The only let down was breakfast which was served buffet style and not particularly good - indeed I had to ask for coffee three times before being served (my wife got her tea at first ask).  I understand this was in part because the kitchens were being refurbished - this was not stated in any of the literature so something to check in the near future before booking.",4,2016,09,21
115,An outstanding hotel catering for all our needs,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Bloomsbury and found the staff knowledgeable, well trained and extremely helpful.

The room was lovely and contained everything you could need including a very comfortable bed.

The Delloway Terrace is certainly worth even if you're not staying at the Bloomsbury.

The hotel is located in easy walking distance of the theatres and other attractions.

We'd certainly recommend and will be back.",5,2016,09,21
115,Anniversary Weekend Break,"Fantastic hotel, great location, staff friendly and helpful and the restaurant catered for my food allergy and staff where all very helpful, especially Estelita.

We will definitely be returning in the future. ",5,2016,09,20
115,Fabulous London Hotel,"I travel to London for business once a year and always stay here. For starters, the location of the hotel is fantastic (2 blocks from the Tottenham Court tube station - on the Central and Northern lines, and easy walk to many great areas of London). Beyond this, my experiences here have always been absolutely positive in every way. Extremely friendly and helpful staff; immaculate property; fantastic (and good sized) rooms that are comfortable and clean; very nice bathrooms; and on. This certainly isn't an inexpensive hotel, but I find it to be the perfect balance of cost and service in London - seriously, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better hotel at this price in all of London. I usually grab a drink in the bar in the evenings, and over the years this has always been a very positive experience: very professional bar, excellent drinks, and regardless of who is working there they are ALWAYS friendly. My stays here are consistently my best hotel experiences of the year (out of 10-12 business trips).",5,2016,09,20
115,Superb stay,My husband and I had a wonderful stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel. Our room was extremely spacious and very clean and the amenities were excellent. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We would highly recommend the hotel.,5,2016,09,20
115,Amazing location,"Beautiful hotel, located just steps from Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road. Gunilla at front desk helped  us with all our needs during our stay. The convenience of a quiet and beautiful room, as well as the attentive staff, is worth the price. Recommendable!",5,2016,09,20
115,scratch the service and there's still work to do to be a top end hotel,"An ok hotel, but punching above weight for what it's charging, verses what you get for your money.

Decor downstairs is lovely and we were met with a warm welcome.

Once away from the main foyer, attention to detail was a little poorer.... henri vacuum cleaners lined floor 8, dirty plates left to gather dust on landing tables - all little things that distract from feeling that you're somewhere special

We stayed in a delux bedroom (room 805) it was nice, if not a little small.  Room had most amenities that you'd expect, windows were velux, so no view, (window closest to bed didn't work properly), blackout blinds really effective tho.

The issues we had were mostly noise.... walls are paper thin, so be prepared to be able to hear exactly what is going on in the next door room.  Also doors are very noisy when closing so you hear every coming and going.

Breakfast was nice and was run as a tight ship.... staff in the restaurant were lovely

The Bloomsbury is a 'nice' hotel, but no more.... for the money you could get better value elsewhere",3,2016,09,19
115,"Excellent Hotel, excellent location and service","We stayed in a studio suite at The Bloomsbury for three nights. With three of us in the room (parents and 15 year-old), we found it was excellent value for our money. The room was large, elegantly furnished and very clean. The large bathroom with bathtub and shower, double sinks and separate toilet room with bidet was one of the reasons we were so comfortable and felt so pampered. The hotel bar, restaurant The Dalloway is on a terrace and great in nice weather. The service is quick yet elegant. We didn't eat here but the food looked very inviting. The reception staff are friendly and efficient. I wished that the breakfast room which is on the lower ground floor Had higher ceilings, but the breakfast itself had a good choice of fruit, cereals, charcuterie and cheese. The service here could have been more efficient. Overall I reccomend this hotel to anyone visiting London for business or pleasure. Of course pleasure travellers or tourists will benefit from the location which is within walking distance to theaters,  restaurants, Chinatown, Soho, Picadilly and Covent Garden.",5,2016,09,18
115,The Bloomsbury is quite nice,"I stayed at the Bloomsbury for 10 days during a recent business trip to London.  It was on a nice, quiet street and walking distance to my work, several nice restaurants, a variety of tourist spots, and shopping.  I ordered room service a few times and the food was very good.  The service was also very good and the staff helpful and friendly.  Being an American, I do miss not having ice machines (lol :-), but the staff was happy to bring me a large bucket when I called down.   Overall, the price was good, the room was quiet and comfortable and I will definitely stay there again on my return trips.",4,2016,09,18
115,Amazing Hotel,"I recently stayed at The Bloomsbury while traveling on business and was very impressed by this hotel. It's conveniently located a block away from Oxford Street and the tube station. Soho is a quick 5-10 minute walk. The lobby of The Bloomsbury is warm and welcoming and the staff is friendly, helpful, and efficient. The rooms are on the small side but are extremely comfortable and luxurious. I ordered room service once for breakfast and once for dinner and it was quick, delicious, and reasonably priced for a hotel of this caliber. A great stay overall and I can't wait to return!",5,2016,09,16
115,"Very Good, But Still Lots Of Room For Improvement","With its excellent location in a (relatively) quiet street just around the corner from the newly refurbished Tottenham Court Rd tube station and its close proximity not only to Oxford St, but also the British Museum, UCL, Euston and all that Fitzrovia has to offer, the Bloomsbury is undoubtedly perfectly placed for many travellers.  It has an air of timeless elegance and 'romance' that may well chime perfectly with the expectations of overseas visitors who crave a quintessentially 'English' bolt hole when they visit London.

In the main, I think most would be happy with this hotel, as is demonstrated by the reviews on this site.  However, that is not to say it is beyond criticism - there are still areas that would give many people cause for concern.  The first is the usual London complaint that rooms are small, but at the Bloomsbury, this manifests itself in a particularly graphic way, because space is so limited that you cannot fit anything but a standard British double bed (four foot six wide - ie one and a half times as wide as a single bed) into their standard room.  I wonder how many couples who can afford to pay £200+ a night for a hotel room have a bed that small at home.  To get what I would call the 'norm' of a British king size bed (ie 5 feet wide and slightly longer than a standard double) you have to pay for a bigger room at the Bloomsbury, which necessitates an outlay of nearly £300 per night, which I would say is excessive, compared to other hotels in major cities around the world.

There are other areas that fall short of the best, too.  Why, in a hotel that seems to encourage a feeling of calm elegance, do all the bedroom doors have to close like they are being slammed at maximum force?  Believe me, if you are in a corridor of  people who want to be the first down to breakfast, or have to leave early to catch a plane, you will be woken up!  And if by some miracle you manage to sleep through that, you may well be disturbed by a hotel operative sliding the big envelope with your bill in it under your door at 6am on the day of your departure.  Why do they do that, for heaven's sake?  They have already swiped your credit card at the time of checking in, so you can't exactly do a runner, can you?  In a hotel like this, it comes across as rude and 'pushy' - not many hotels I know do this sort of thing any more.  Don't move anything in the minibar fridge either, or the sensors under each individual bottle will register that you have removed the item and the hotel will attempt to charge you for it.

Then there's breakfast - most hotels of this sort of price have a 'juice station' where you can simply select what you want and pour it into a glass.  Not the Bloomsbury - here when you want juice, you have to order it via a waiter.  Why?  It's only Tropicana, not freshly squeezed.  And someone needs to tell the staff that whilst it's normal to serve coffee from jugs in which it has stewed for a while, this is NOT how tea should be served.  Tea should (by default) come in a pot - freshly made, not be served to you from a jug like it is by an air stewardess on a plane.

Then there's the fact that at the time we stayed, the hotel was refurbishing the kitchen, so couldn't offer the full choice of cooked breakfast.  The result was that it was served buffet style from casserole type bowls that had no electrical heating and so eventually became cold.  Did the hotel know they would have to do this at breakfast on those days?  Yes.  Did they apologise and thank guests for their understanding?  Yes.  Did they offer any kind of reduction for the reduced quality of the food?  Absolutely not.  A bit poor really, considering the cost.

So, overall, the Bloomsbury is very good and I would definitely stay there again, but it is not cheap, even by London standards and some areas of its operation could be significantly improved.",4,2016,09,15
115,Very good but quite great,"The Bloomsbury is on the edge of a great hotel
Firstly the staff are generally helpful and deliver service that you would xpect from this quality of hotel.
Sadly during our stay the kitchens where being refitted, due to this if being fully booked we where unable to dine, and breakfast on Sunday was reduced to a hot buffet, a poor substitute for the freshly cooked option.

Surprisingly the room lacked a guide to the hotel, that adequately explained what dining, bar, lounge facilities where available, there seemed to be an assumption throughout the hotel ghost guests would understand what was where.

A very good hotel, but not yet a great one",4,2016,09,15
115,Family reunion,"I'm a Londoner by birth living out of town. I had family stopping over from the USA to break the jetlag in London before flying on. One 94 year old and his four children. We had 4 bedrooms, his was accessible. I don't know if the hotel has adjoining rooms to their accessible ones, we didn't have one and it would have been useful. As it turned out the other 3 rooms were at the other end of the corridor. The rooms were all very comfortable. The public areas have a welcoming feel.

Now a few minor issues.

1. Service during the wonderful breakfast is really slow.
2. A little glass bowl I use at night to put trinkets and hearing aids in and had left on a bedside table went missing. Whilst apologies were made it would have been nice had they offered a substitute. It was not of any value but it had travelled the world with me and was really useful.
3. There was a mouse. On the terrace.",4,2016,09,14
115,Surprisingly great stay,"Having stayed in many London hotels and always looked for 4* but not always getting quite what we expected The Bloomsbury was a definite success. Nice room, very clean and good size. All staff very friendly and helpful.",5,2016,09,14
115,Convenient and modern,"Our stay at this hotel was terrific. Upon booking the room I requested an early check-in since we would be arriving from a long international flight. We arrived around 10am and the receptionist was friendly and promptly checked us in. The room we had was small but comfortable and for the price, completely worth it. If you wish to stay in a central location in London, I recommend The Bloomsbury!",5,2016,09,14
115,An Excellent Hotel in Bloomsbury,"The Bloomsbury located at 16-22 Russel Street, in London, England is an excellent hotel. The staff is extremely professional as well as being ""happy,"" polite and always willing to help with any request. 

Fillipo, one of the waiters, was a joy to see in the dining area. 
I highly recommend this hotel and I plan only to stay here on my next trip.",5,2016,09,13
115,Relaxed and comfortable stay in London,"Bloomsbury Hotel is ideal for many reasons including: location, friendly staff, cleanliness, easy reach of main theaters, restaurants and shops. Although just off Tottenham Court Road/Oxford Street it is a very quiet area.
Highly recommend and surely visit again. ",5,2016,09,13
115,Nice hotel ,"Been here for two nights. Beautiful building. Real Art Deco. My double room was really small but very well furnished. Luckily I only had a trolley, if I had a big luggage, it will have been difficult to place. Nice little bathroom. 
The only problem was the the movie choices in the room. Great choice but none was working. On the first night I was offered a DVD player, but then was told there were none available because they were used by other rooms. The second day I tried again but it was not working. I was told the system was new and if too many people wanted to use it at the same time, maybe this was why it was not working ( this was at 1 pm, when I believe most of the guest were not in their room) After some insistence I was given a DVD player for the night , with some movies. 
The concierge service was excellent. ",3,2016,09,12
115,My friend and I stayed here for the first time but it will not be the last. Do not hesitate to book a room.,"hotel and staff without fault. The concierges were simply charming and could not have been more helpful. Big hoorah for ""Reggie "" in the dalloway bar. The hotel was so central and it was easy to visit everywhere we wanted to go easily",5,2016,09,12
115,Absolutely amazing!,"From the moment we booked this hotel to the moment we left the service was amazing and I can not recommend it enough. 
My husband booked this as a surprise for my 30th birthday and they made sure it was very special. I received a card and cakes, plus they decorated the room with roses and chocolates. 

Our rooms was exceptional and very comfortable with absolutely everything that you need and more. 
The hotel itself is a short distance from Euston and very central, only 2-3 minutes walk to Oxford Street. It is beautifully decorated and very romantic with its dark decor and lighting. The staff are so friendly, and can not do enough for you. 
Breakfast was amazing, again the service brilliant. Very relaxing and comfortable dining area
The resultant The Dalloway Terrace is also worth a visit.... 👌🏻 hopefully we will be back to see you again soon. Thank you everyone!! ",5,2016,09,12
115,Fabulous hotel,"Staff excellent, good location, great breakfast and a friendly welcome.  We travelled to London to see a play and stayed at the Bloomsbury because it's so handy to go to either Covent Garden or shopping in Oxford street.",5,2016,09,12
115,Top-notch,"This hotel was recommended to us by friends.  As soon as we stepped in we were made to feel so welcome. The level of service provided by all staff members is outstanding.  They seem to be genuinely interested in ensuring you get the best possible service. The history of the building, which I read about in the book provided in the hotel room, is really interesting.  The lobby is actually a place were you want to sit down and relax.  The terrace is also lovely.  If you are North-American you'll probably find the room a bit tiny but it is well appointed.It is close to restaurants, pubs, bus lines and a short walking distance to the subway.",5,2016,09,11
115,Romantic London,"I chose this hotel because it was close to the British Museum (world's best collection of ""stolen"" objects; the Rosetta Stone alone is worth the trip). It was also a 40th Anniversary trip. The hotel turned out to be quite a treat. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. There is a wonderful bar in the basement and an OK restaurant. However, this is an area full of restaurants within walking distance; the challenge is often getting a seat. (We showed up on gay pride weekend; the place was mobbed). The hotel also features a classic British tea service, which we tackled on our last day--best for last. A special treat for my English major wife was the book collection of Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney. You can almost see the literary lights of London gathering at the Bloomsbury for drinks and conversation.",5,2016,09,08
115,"Good Location, good Hotel","I stayed for business, and the hotel has very good location, and services. Staffs are very kind, helpful. The Hotel is very close to Tottenham Court Underground Station. Lots of restaurants and coffee shops are in the area. ",5,2016,09,08
115,Leisure,"We had a visit to London and stayed at our favourite hotel, the Bloomsbury!
The service was great and we'd like to say a special thank you to Aladdin,  Leila, Sebastian, Claudia and Joal. In the Dalloway Terrace, thanks for making it a special evening.",5,2016,09,07
115,Very nice hotel,"We stayed in this hotel for a week. All staff is very polite and helpful. We had some issue with water (pipe above us was broken), so the apologized, moved us to another room and invited us for very nice dinner in their nice restaurant for free. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends.
wifi connection could have better stability :-)",5,2016,09,06
115,Would defiantly come back! ,"This was mine and my girlfriends first time staying in a Doyle collection hotel and it won't be the last, from the second you walk through the door you are looked after.

The staff are extremely friendly and very helpful, the hotel is beautifully decorated and gives off a very warm feeling.

The restaurant (dalloway terrace) has a very relaxed feel to it, it completely makes you forget that your sitting in the busy west end central of London.

Our room was on the 4th floor, we had no issues with noise or any sort of disturbances, the room was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable, we woke up feeling very rested.

I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone! ",4,2016,09,06
115,elegant hotel and 7-star service from every member of staff you come into contact with,"Great room, very quiet, fantastic very deeply coiled mattresses,spacious elegant bathroom, wonderful staff - everything you could possibly want in a city break. From the moment you step into the hotel with all the luxury of a stately home, you feel like a VIP.",5,2016,09,05
115,Grauation visit,The hotel is very close to everything you want to see and visit. Lots of restaurants and coffee shops in the area. Walking distance to most tourist attractions. Nice atmosphere in the Hotel Bloomsbury and very good drinks. The dining room could have been a little bit bigger and airier but the bar was very cosy. ,5,2016,09,04
115,Luxury accomodation and Suberb service from  very pleasant and well trained staff,"We stayed for 4 nights in July at this very elegant Boutique Hotel in London,,  located near the British Museum. The rooms while not overly large are extremely comfortable and well appointed with good sized bathrooms, ours had a shower. The Bloomsbury Hotel is a bit like a step back in time, with its Georgian Facade and lavish Art Deco Lobby.The main restaurant, the Dalloway Terrace was perfect on a summer's evening and the food very good. We were particularly pleased by the  great attention to service  displayed by the  staff, particularly Reggie from Dalloways and Maria from Breakfast in the Bloomsbury Club Dining Room, and the Concierge and very helpful door staff.  All what one should expect in a Hotel of this quality.",5,2016,09,04
115,Superb hotel,"I only stayed for one night on a business trip with colleagues but we all had lovely rooms, clean, comfortable, right temperature and we had a quick check in and no fuss from the staff. It's a great location easy for Euston and the sights in this area.",5,2016,09,03
115,Sumptuous stay!,"One of the best hotels in London! If not the best! The minute you walk in you are a 5* guest. Everything is beautiful from the reception, to the rooms, bar, restaurant and terrace! The food is also fantastic and staff in every part of the hotel fantastic! I've stayed many times and in other London hotels but you'll find it hard to top this place! ",5,2016,09,02
115,Coming back for more!!,"We stumbled across the Bloomsbury on our way to the theatre this week, and I must say we do not regret it for a second! 
Entered the bar for a round of drinks and ended up having 3! 
This hotel is absolutely astonishing and both me and my partner were so overcome with the exceptional service at the bar, namely a young lady called Elissa (sp.). She did not hesitate to answer all of our queries about the hotel, as well as showing a huge sense of pride for her place of work! Her knowledge of beverages and suggestions after we informed her of our flavor profiles were spot on! This hard worker is a credit to the hotel.
The club bites recommended were lovely, from the mini burgers to the truffle fries!! 
The only downside is the lack of lighting in the bar. Was difficult to read the menus but our hostess was happy to read and explain all necessary. 
Also if you want a seat in the divine outside area get in early as it was all taken up when we arrived.
We will definitely be coming to stay at the hotel as a treat!",5,2016,09,02
115,Perfect stay,"I booked this hotel for a weekend in London with my boyfriend. The staff gave various recommendations of restaurants & were very helpful with directions of main London sights. We had drinks in the bar which had a classy tone and a wide variety or drinks. Our room was spotless, luxury, we felt very comfortable and safe. Around 10 minute walk to convent garden etc. Will be booking again next time. ",5,2016,08,31
115,Amazing hotel superb location,"Visited in late August this year as we were going to Ronnie Scott's (which is within walking distance).  Hotel is just gorgeous from the decor to the lovely terraced area and bar garden.  Our room was not quite ready so they upgraded us to a suite which I would definitely recommend.  Huge comfy bed, big bathroom with bath and shower.  Friendly helpful staff.  Really could not fault this hotel at all and cannot wait to stay there again!!!",5,2016,08,31
115,Great hotel in amazing location,"Stayed at Bloomsbury Hotel for a 3 night weekend in  London.  The hotel itself is in a fabulous art deco building with wonderful public spaces that capture the essence of 1930's literary set London. 

 I stayed in a standard room which was very compact and for me was fine as travelling solo and out most of the weekend, it would be very tight for a couple.  It was however elegantly furnished with a comfortable bed.  My only issue was the shower was a sharp stream of water and I couldn't adjust the shower head.

In a fantastic location, Oxford St is less than 3 minute walk and I spent much of my time with friends in SoHo which took less than 10 minutes to reach.  I'd recommend it as a great and stylish London bolt hole.  Good service from all the staff I interacted with.",4,2016,08,31
115,Gem,"The Bloomsbury is a lovely hotel in a great area.  The staff was super helpful and friendly.  Our room was a standard room but had plenty of room and amenities.  The hotel itself  is a well maintained classic hotel with beautiful wood throughout.

We had a full English breakfast included in our room and it was very good.  The hours for breakfast allowed us to sleep in without missing out.  During the week breakfast ended at 10:30 am and on the weekend 11:30.

The hotel is located just a block from The British Museum and close enough to walk to the Underground.  The Theatre district was a short taxi away as well as other sightseeing areas.",5,2016,08,31
115,Excellent Hotel,"My son (10 yrs) and I were looking for a comfortable place to stay near the British Museum at a reasonable price.  Aside from price and location, I really didn't know what to expect.  The Bloomsbury was a fantastic experience from check-in to check-out.  Friendly, knowledgeable staff, good food, very nice room all exceeded our expectations.",5,2016,08,31
115,Overnight stay ,A lovely place to stay. The staff were very accomodating. On arrival I asked if a couple of roses could be placed in our room as we were celebrating our engagement. Returning from a late lunch we opened the suite and the look on my fiancees face was something I'll hold for a very long time. The staff had scattered rose petals all over the bed and floor. Sensational!! Thanks Bloomsbury staff....I'd recommend Bloomsbury for THAT romantic weekend.,5,2016,08,29
115,a great choice,"We recently stayed at the Bloomsbury and were very happy with our choice.   I had booked three rooms for my family and myself.    The rooms were all similar except for size of bed, two kings and one queen.    Very clean and comfortable and bathroom very adequate.  The only hitch was the room my husband and I had did not have any drawers which was annoying.  The other rooms did and I think it's a matter of each room isn't a copy cat of the other because of it being an old building being renovated for a modern hotel.   
The staff and service could not have been nicer, pleasant  and any more efficient , they all were so very attentive.   
The rooms were cleaned and ready while we were at breakfast which is most unusual and such a pleasant surprise.  
The breakfast was very good and once again the service perfect.  The staff remembered us each day and knew we needed a table for five and then the OJ, coffee and water was brought right away. 
My husband and I usually stay at a higher end hotel but because we had family with us we wanted watch our budget and ended up making a great choice in the Bloomsbury.  
Not to mention it is a super location, right next to the British Museum, around the corner from the tube and a short walk to Covent Garden.",5,2016,08,28
115,Relaxing Afternoon Tea,"We enjoyed our private afternoon tea in the hotel lobby area. As we were the only couple there at the time and it was mid-week. Would have liked to have been seated outside on the terrace. Service was good and tea selection adequate. The sandwiches were tasty, but the desserts a bit too sweet for my taste. Having had afternoon teas in many places world wide, I have to say that this tea experience seemed to lack something. But the black tea selection I chose was very good.",4,2016,08,28
115,Overnight stay,"3 ladies, 3 children and a fantastic experience at the Bloomsbury.
Great location , wonderful rooms plus the Dalloway bar was fun and the service fabulous .
I would like to mention the friendliness of the reception team and the concierge who couldn't do enough to make our stay pleasurable . We will definitely be back ! 
",5,2016,08,28
115,Fantastic customer service,"My son-in-law took my daughter was taken to Bloomsbury for her 30th Birthday. I contacted the restaurant to order a bottle wine for their meal and spoke to Gintare, she was exceptionally professional and helpful; once they knew it was a birthday surprise she asked if they could arrange for a birthday cake and card at no extra cost. The staff were excellent at the meal and made a brilliant day even more special. I could not thank them enough they were amazing. My daughter was so happy with the whole experience.",5,2016,08,26
115,Excellent,"I stayed in the bloomsbry hotel overnight and it was excellent. The hotel is just a 2 minute walk from the British museum, a bakery over the road, a barbers and a nail salon down the road, a 5 minute walk from street of restronts wich is very convinite because the hotel doesn't come with meals and a 5 minutes from the underground. The dallway bar has good cocktails and soft drinks and every day at 11am, they put out cucumber water for travellers. The rooms are excellent and some of the family suits are joined together. The infamation desk in the lounge can book taxies, tickets and most things you require. I enjoyed my stay at the blombry hotel, I hope, if you book, then you will too. My only negative comment is that our room was next to a road so I didn't sleep very well.",5,2016,08,26
115,"Beautiful hotel, excellent service","Our family booked us into the Bloomsbury as a 25th Anniversary gift. The Hotel has a beautiful interior with a wonderful staircase. The staff were all very friendly but professional at the same time, it is just 10 minutes walk from the British museum.
I don't know the price of the room as it was a gift but we had a Queen size bed, a large sitting area and en suite bathroom with both a bath and separate shower cubicle. 
The room was lovely, but the bathroom although very clean was perhaps due some refurbishment.
We also had an afternoon tea which was served with a lot of care and finesse and quite delicious.
Overall, very impressed.",5,2016,08,26
115,I suppose i got what I paid for.,"Very comfortable hotel. Very small room; even smaller en-suite.
The only downside was the size of our room and the en-suite. The lighting above above the mirror in the shower room was poor for shaving and the distance between the edge of the wash hand basin and the handle of the shower door was such that the door was better left open so that the handle was inside the shower compartment. My waist is 38"" and I had and argument with that handle on a couple of occasions!  Corpulent guests with poor eyesight could have difficulty in room 719.",4,2016,08,25
115,Affordable Luxury,Beautiful Hotel. Room was immaculate and was a good size for the price and location. About 2 minutes walk to Oxford Street. Staff were very friendly and helpful. On arrival we were offered hot towels to freshen up and when leaving we were given bottles of water to keep hydrated in the scorching heat.Only gripe was there were no toiletries provided only a bar of soap but I'm sure this was just a mere oversight and if mentioned this would have been corrected. Overall a very enjoyable stay. ,5,2016,08,25
115,Best time ever,Absolutely amazing. Organised the stay for a wedding and birthday with family and friends and couldn't have been better. Very attentive staff who made us feel very welcome. Breakfast is excellent with a good choice and we had afternoon tea in the library for 26 people and was set out lovely. Our guests were thrilled with the whole stay and loved every minute. Will be returning.,5,2016,08,24
115,A classy and ideally located London base,"The Bloomsbury is now my favourite London hotel. The location is terrific; while it is literally minutes by foot from the hustle and bustle of Oxford St and Soho the hotel itself is on the much quieter Great Russell St. It is a revelation to find a hotel of this calibre on such a serene street just around the corner from the world's busiest shopping thoroughfare.
Location is only one of The Bloomsbury's advantage. The hotel occupies a beautifully renovated building and the interior spaces convey classical style with a modern touch, including the rooms. The decor may recall the early 20th century but the details have a current flavour.
For the price point the rooms are generous by London standards, and well appointed. Mine was very comfortable with only a minor niggle in a broken desk lamp. I'm sure the hotel would have addressed it quickly had I bothered to bring it up.
I had a coffee in the lobby area and observed other guests partaking of the afternoon tea and it appeared they all enjoyed it. I had breakfast on the recently opened Dalloway Terrace which is a haven of shady style, with thoughtful touches such as a blanket on every chair for the chilly mornings and evenings. My eggs benedict was perfect (and I am a connoisseur of eggs!).
Staff were helpful, chatty and pleasant. I had one small disagreement with one individual who was initially unhelpful regarding changing my breakfast option but that soon blew over.
If you want a London base in a fantastic location with class and quality you'll be very happy at The Bloomsbury.",4,2016,08,24
115,Excellent in every respect,"I prefer the area around the British Museum every time I visit London. My choice this time was a good one: The Bloomsbury was a great, with very attentive receptionists. The building is charming and much nicer than many of the modern international hotels. The room was well furnished, including a Nespresso machine. It was maybe a bit small but yet comfortable. I will definitely return when next in town.",5,2016,08,23
115,Dinner and stay over,"Superb location , and the terrace restaurant dinner was exquisite . Well done the team 
I especially enjoy the hospitality which was outstanding .
200 words when 20 would suffice..
Well here goes, the room was tastefully decorated .",5,2016,08,23
115,Excellent afternoon tea,"I'd arranged for a surprise afternoon tea for my friend and our two teenage daughters.  This is an experience that my friend had never had before.  Staff were on hand and were superb in explaining what was included and also catered for a number of different requests - gluten free, no butter, different types of tea.  They even gave us two complimentary glasses of champagne to celebrate my friends 40th.  Great atmosphere, food was divine and some of the best cakes I have ever tasted.  Joao in the lounge was outstanding",5,2016,08,23
115,Perfect for our trip,"I booked four twin rooms for a girls night out in London.  The hotel is in a great location, walking distance to many attractions and in particular for us, the Charlotte Street restaurants.  The people working there were so friendly and helpful, Gabriella was notably helpful in Reception when she sorted out our credit per room and take it off the one bill.  When it was raining we were offered good advice, don't take a taxi, take one of our umbrellas and walk a short distance. Trust me, in London that's rare and a very valuable, realistic assessment of our taxis and one way systems!
The rooms were very comfy and quiet with space to hang our dresses and a modern ensuite shower room.  There's a nice conservatory style bar, which happened to be running a gin promotion, we enjoyed this very much.
We got a great deal and will definitely stay here again - turns out, so have some of my friends already!",5,2016,08,23
115,Lovely weekend,"My husband, I and two friends stayed at the Bloomsbury in Great Russell St overnight last weekend as we had tickets for The Bodyguard musical at the Dominion Theatre which is just round the corner.  Everything about this hotel is lovely, we were upgraded to a really nice room which had everything we needed, even down to the illuminated makeup mirror in the bathroom - a must have for every woman! Breakfast was included in the overnight stay rate and we were not disappointed - plenty to choose from -I wanted to have Eggs Florentine but not on a white muffin, preferring nutty wholemeal bread - no trouble substituting at all which cannot always be said of many hotels (some of which will tell you to get your own bread!!) I would not hesitate recommending this hotel to anyone, especially as it is situated so centrally to shops and theatres.  We will definitely be returning!",5,2016,08,23
115,Amazing hotel in great area - reasonably priced,Loved staying here! The rooms are pretty spacious for a London hotel and in it's located in a great area. The hotel is walking distance from Holburn station and has lots of great restaurants and cafes nearby.,5,2016,08,22
115,"Great Service, OK rooms","Just spent several nights at this hotel.  The personnel working here are very friendly and eager to help out.  Our room was not as small as expected, OK size.  You must be careful though we tripped many times on the step up from the door to our room.  Rooms were clean and floors were very creaky. I was worried about the people below us!  It is like a maze finding your way from the elevator to your room.  AC seemed to shut off in the middle of the night, we thought it might be on a timer so every time someone got up to use the bathroom they turned it off and then on before getting back in bed. Free wifi was great. We enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it.",4,2016,08,22
115,Pleasant stay at the Bloomsbury hotel,"We stayed for one evening at the Bloomsbury hotel on Great Russell Street, within the hub for theatres, eateries, shopping and walking distance to Covent Garden, Soho, Oxford Street and Regent Street. It is easy to get to, just a couple of blocks from Tottenham Court underground station. 

You walk up the stone steps on to the entrance of an impressive Georgian building. We were greeted by one of the hotel staff who opened the doors for us. Reception desk is to the left where we checked in without any fuss. We were given the room cards and the free Wi-Fi was explained to us. Our room was on the 4th floor. It was a nice room with a double bed, TV, bathroom, vanity desk, wardrobe, a relaxing chair and mini bar. Inside the wardrobe there are bath robes, iron, hairdryer, extra blanket and a tea/coffee tray with a small kettle.to make your own brew. There is also a coffee making machine. 

Although the room is on a slightly small side but well equipped and of good décor. There is a shower over the bath and the bathroom is modern, clean and compact. 

Breakfast is served on the lower ground floor in the Club dining room. Once seated at the table, we were offered coffee, tea, juice or water and told to help ourselves to the breakfast bar where there is cold meat, cheeses, fresh fruits, cereals, croissants and Danish pastry.  Cooked breakfast can be ordered from the menu. We both had full English breakfast.  When we mentioned that mushrooms were missed out from our plate, the staff brought out a bowl of mushrooms and apologised for the oversight.  

There is an informal dining area on the ground floor which extends out to the court yard. You can also sit on the lounge sofas to read a book or have coffee if you wish. 

The concerige is very helpful and knowledgeable.  We found the staff in the botel helpful and courteous.  Checking out is relatively easy, quite effortless in fact. 

It was a very pleasant stay and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Bloomsbury, and will not hesitate to stay here again. Hopefully, we will be given a bigger room to enjoy.

115,Wonderful Hotel,"Very impressed with the quality and service. 10/10. This hotel as it all great ambience style and  location. if you are looking for a great place to stay this is it...will return. Highly recommended. Hotel rooms are spacious and Dalloway terrace is lovely. The Bloomsbury club bar also lovely, reminded me of The Savoy bar",5,2016,08,22
115,Perfect hotel stay,"Lovely hotel, great location for shopping, theatre & Covent Garden.
Hotel rooms clean & comfortable, not very roomy but big enough for a 1 night stay.
All facilities in hotel, tea & coffee making in rooms, hairdryer & toiletries.
Also the lifts were very quick, & never had to wait any time for it.

115,Divine,"We stayed here for the first night of our honeymoon - and what a treat! You feel special from the moment you walk through the door and into its beautiful, hushed lobby. The meal on the Terrace was delicious too (we were blessed with great weather but there's patio heaters too) A great stay for a special treat!",5,2016,08,21
115,Great place to stay! Will come again,"Everyone that works in the Bloomsbury was always helpful, kind polite! When I first arrived I was greeted by Jero (who was cheery and made me feel Welcome right away. Estelita and Maria (head supervisors) that  took care of my breakfast check in each morning and always always polite and caring that all is ok. The servers Jorge and Maya brought me elegant breakfasts each morning. The head of house keep Than made sure my sheets were changed daily. Lost I have to mention how all the Concierge: Naleef, Ivan, Brian, Pablo, Dale answered every question I had and really made my stay enjoyable ( I had many,many question) were were really patient. When I return I would definitely stay here .
Sincerely,
E.P.",5,2016,08,19
115,Fabulous,"The Bloomsbury is one of the best hotels we have ever had the pleasure of staying in.  I was traveling with my husband and 15 year old son.  The International staff are very attentive and friendly.  Our greeting and service from Gunila (Sweden) at reception was exceptional. Gunila showed us the beauty and amenities of the hotel in great detail, helping us feel very welcome and important for our stay here.  Gorgeous main lobby with inviting music, lights and seating.  Breakfast was superb with service from Elizabeth (Holland) to match.  Maria (Spanish) greeted us at breakfast each morning by name and a very welcoming smile, showing us to any table we desired.  We had dinner at the Dalloway Terrace and experienced the same attention and exceptional meal.   Beautiful atmosphere for the Terrace of sparkle lights and comfortable seating.  Our waiter Reggie (Brazil) catered to our every need, with perfect suggestions of meal choices and sides.
The room we had was on the 6th floor facing Russell St. with no noise and the quiet air conditioning was easy to adjust and accurate for comfort.  Our King bed with down pillows and light down duvet top sheet was perfect balance of temperature and comfort.  Our sons cot was fitted with the same comfort, it was a struggle to get him up and at it in the mornings.
Marble tile and full piece bathroom set us into a spa like atmosphere, feeling fully relaxed to set out on our days of adventure in the city of London.
Our son used the gym and felt he was not lacking for any machine or free weight to get his work out done.  Thank you.
Perfectly situated in the heart of London took only minutes to walk to many great sights.  Excellent choices of dining restaurants or pubs.  Right on the shopping Meca of Oxford St..  Metro moments away to reach anywhere in London.  Fabulous!!!
Thank you to everyone at The Bloomsbury for the best experience of hotel adventures we have every had.  We will definitely look to stay at a Doyle Collection Hotel in the future. 
Cheers Pauline Colin and Jones

115,Three Days In London.,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is great value for the money. It is very clean, comfortable and well situated.  The decor and architecture is very pleasant and appropriate. The hotel is nestled on a lovely street but don't expect sweeping views as neighbouring buildings are spitting distance as is the norm. I found the food and service in the restaurants and room service to be quite acceptable. Staff are very welcoming, efficient and friendly. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2016,08,18
115,Beautiful Hotel - Two mins walk from Tottenham Court Road,"​Stayed at the Bloomsbury a few years ago and it really is a lovely hotel. Had a good stay, with just some small things to mention. Check in could have been more efficient, one of my colleagues was informed she was a ""no-show"" even though we checked in together.  We were asked for passports as well, this must be a new thing.​ That's no problem, however all she needed was for us to write down the passport no's on the reg card, she did not even check so we could have noted anything down, so for me that is rather pointless.

The room itself was small, cosy and typical of London standards. Bed was super comfy and the room had complimentary water, minibar (paid), gown & slippers (lovely soft ones, not the cheap type). The hotel's breakfast (continental) was just shy of £21!! Whilst nice it was not worth more than £10 so definitely a rip off & would advise guests to avoid & rather dine in the many cafes available in London, we did this on the second morning. A shame the hotel would out-price themselves. Service charge was also added & I know this is probably standard of London hotels, however I think it should be discretionary considering it wasn't like a lengthy dinner at ease, it was a quick half hour breakie. 

Marie on reception was very kind and when we requested a slightly later checkout she obliged, which really helped us due to logistics of our day, great to see staff being so accommodating, so well done to her. Checkout was also smooth & efficient (lady named Gulliana I might have the spelling wrong).

Location is excellent, two mins walk from Tottenham Court Road station, exit Oxford Street, as there are improvement works going on so best to get out the right side. Wifi is free & excellent connection no matter where you at in the hotel.

I would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2016,08,17
115,Beautiful Hotel,"Just home from a weekend in London and I could not recommend this hotel enough. Brilliant location just off Oxford street and such a short walk down to  Leicester Square and Covent Garden. The two items that really stood out for us were

 (1) The Staff - all of them so friendly and accommodating and went out of their way to ensure my wife (who's birthday it was) was spoiled from the moment she arrived (see photos attached) 

(2) the outdoor terrace and bar in the evening is such a beautiful and relaxing bar to chill out and enjoy a few drinks

We look forward to returning some day very soon

Many thanks to all the team

Regards
Dave ",5,2016,08,15
115,Overnight stop for a show,"The room was good, very clean and well presented. Polite and efficient front of hotel reception staff. Breakfast -on entering the restaurant we were seated quickly although the wall bench seats are low and sagging. Tea and toast were about 10 mins arriving and the toast was warmed bread as opposed to toasted and cold. The self service starter/cereal area was good and an excellent choice, good also for continental style.The Full English breakfast was good in quality and content although once finished the plate sat in front of me for almost 20 mins and I had get up to find a supervisor who apologised, looked genuinely shocked and sorted it out personally and efficiently. Lifts not that efficient I walked down from the 4th floor to the lower ground, where breakfast is served and was there just in front of the couple that had waited for the lift!",4,2016,08,15
115,London gem,"Stayed at the Bloomsbury from Aug 6 to Aug 11. Very nice stay. The staff was first rate. Our travel coordinator at United Vacations must have mentioned to the hotel that I was taking my daughter to London for her birthday as they had a card and small cake for her when we arrived. The entire staff went out of their way to make sure everything was just right. Breakfast is very good, had the standard English breakfast one day and French toast another. Both were excellent. The hotel is in a very good location. On a side street that is quiet. It's location is just down the street from the British Museum, a two minute walk to the Tottenham Court tube station, a five minute walk to Leicester Square and the theater district, shopping and eating places close by. The room was on the small side as is pretty normal for London but plenty adequate as we did not spend much time in the room anyway. The concierge was a great help in organizing our sightseeing trips and helping with directions, cabs, and restaurant recommendations. When we asked about fish and chips he directed us to a great place called the Golden Union Fish Bar. Very good place. I would highly recommend the Bloomsbury for comfort, location, and the staff. ",5,2016,08,14
115,Stay at Bloomsbury,"A wonderful hotel with friendly and helpful staff. Excellent facilities. Prices at the more expensive end of the scale but you get what you pay for. In terms of room provision, they catered well for my family.",5,2016,08,14
115,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed on the 13th August for our anniversary. Room and bathroom had lovely decor. Bed very comfortable. There was tea, hot choclatethe  plus a coffee machine. Also Iron and hairdryer.  We had complimentary chocolates and a card delivered to our room. After we return from our evening out the staff had decorated our bed with roses in the shape or hearts lovely touch it made my evening. The covered restaurant on the side of the hotel was stunning with plants every where giving it a lovely garden feeling the food smelt delicious. The hotel is in a great location 3 minutes from tottenham court tube station. The dominion theatre (showing bodyguard at the moment) is 2 minutes around the corner. The British Museum about 5 minutes walk away. Plus Oxford Street, Covent Garden all within walking distance. (Or short tube ride).It is on a very busy road but we found our room very quiet. Good choice of  Breakfast available. ",4,2016,08,14
115,Theatre Break,"Excellent hotel we stayed in superior double room on 7th floor which was compact but perfectly formed, had everything we needed other than a little more space.  Room was very clean.  Only drawback was price of drinks in Bloomsbury Club Bar, compared to other West End bars and theatre drinks, we felt slightly stung by cost, so check out prices carefully before ordering. Large glass of Merlot cost us £18 and this was one of cheapest!  All Staff were very polite and courteous, would stay there again.",5,2016,08,13
115,Excellent one night stay ... wanted more !,Spent last night in The Bloomsbury hotel on Great Russell Street. From the hot towels on arrival to the comp mineral water on departure we were very impressed with the friendly and efficient staff in such lovely surroundings. Well placed for exploring London (and especially a theatre trip and/or eating out) this hotel also offered lovely rooms and an excellent breakfast. Would recommend booking breakfast with your room as it might seem a little pricey to pay separately but it was delicious and there was a wide choice from which you could select as much as you wanted. We stayed in a standard double which was not enormous but offered ample space for 2 people and was well designed with excellent tea and coffee in the room and lovely toiletries in the bathroom. We definitely plan on staying here again and thanks to all the staff for making us feel so welcome.,5,2016,08,13
115,The front desk is in disarray,"We had multiple problems with the front desk. I called down four times and waited on hold for about two minutes each time in order to get a wakeup call, but there was no answer. When I walked down, the desk was quiet, but the staff member told me that she had seen me try to call but that that she had no time to pick up. Earlier that evening, I had tried to mail postcards: the front desk staff member referred me to the concierge who could not be found, and when he turned up he said he did not know how to get stamps. The next morning the manager assured me that they could send my postcards, they took my money, then collected more money to ensure the correct postage. None of the postcards were received. Nice work if you can get it.
The food in the lobby bar restaurant at dinner was mediocre, probably the worst meal of a 12-night stay in England.
On the plus side, the breakfast downstairs was tasty and was a good value.
Overall, I would never stay at this hotel again.",2,2016,08,12
115,Beautiful hotel - great attention to detail,My wife and I stayed here for a short visit this week. All staff were very friendly and helpful; our room was spotless and kitted out with everything one could ask for and the walk in shower spraying you with multiple jets from every angle was great! Monogrammed bathrobes and slippers added to the luxurious atmosphere. What made the stay uniquely  special was that at check in we told Jero the concierge that we were going to see The Lion King that evening. Imagine our amazement that on our return we found the official program book on our bed with a note hoping that we had had a good time - it was a gift from the hotel to us! The Bloomsbury's special full English breakfast was also high quality. Only slight downside was the bar which was extremely busy and filled with Towie types (good people watching). This hotel is NOT expensive but it manages to create that atmosphere - we will definitely be returning.,5,2016,08,12
115,Wonderful hotel in fabulous location,"I recently stayed for 3 nights at The Bloomsbury and will definitely be back. The hotel is a haven of peace in bustling central London with friendly, welcoming staff. I stayed in a quiet, well equipped room with a super comfortable bed. The outside restaurant is a real find - great food in a lovely setting. Housekeeping needed nudging a couple of times, but otherwise I can't fault it. Highly recommended.",5,2016,08,11
115,Excellent will definitely be back! ,What a fantastic hotel. Amazing service and beautiful decor. Cannot say enough about how impressive everything about this hotel was! The staff were fantastic and nothing was too much  trouble. Ty the afternoon tea. Would highly recommend. ,5,2016,08,11
115,Overnight business stay in deluxe room,All staff incredibly helpful. Excellent cocktail bar. Location good for getting around central London. Room was amazing - huge with plenty of space to work or relax. The bathroom had a lovely double shower and a separate bath/,5,2016,08,11
115,London highlight,"It has been a year since my stay at the Bloomsbury, and I'm sorry not to have contributed this review sooner.  I travelled alone on business, and am not well-acquainted with London.  From start to finish, the staff was so welcoming, helpful, and professional.  Rooms were extremely comfortable and spotlessly clean.  Breakfasts were excellent, and I had several delicious and convenient dinners in the hotel dining room as well.  The Bloomsbury offers real hospitality in a lovely setting, and I look forward to a return visit.  Highly recommended.",5,2016,08,10
115,"Wonderful, comfortable family hotel","We just returned from a truly wonderful stay at the Bloomsbury. I was traveling with my two young boys and the hotel staff was wonderful with them, sending them a toy when we arrived. 

Breakfast each morning was a delight and particularly Maria was a gem--she remembered my boys order and even presented them with a gift when we left. 

The room was very comfortable--not huge but nicely appointed and quiet. A couple of calls to housekeeping for extra supplies were not always answered and required an additional call or two, but not terrible in the scheme of things. All in all really wonderful and we would stay here again--the neighborhood is not my favorite but the centrality and the great accommodation were tops. ",5,2016,08,10
115,Wonderful experience!,"My husband and I had a fantastic 4 night stay very recently and we both found it a wonderful experience. All staff were so welcoming, courteous and helpful at all times. Our room (419) was perfect with more space than is usually found in some London hotels, and was kept at a high level of cleanliness and comfort throughout our stay. It was also wonderfully quiet and peaceful and we slept soundly each night. A special mention must go to the staff of the BC bar & outdoor enchanted garden, particularly Matthew & Martina! If you wish to relax and be pampered with drinks etc after a hard day's sightseeing then pay them a visit, you will be so glad you did! 
The Bloomsbury is perfectly located for all the major sights of Central London, very close to Tottenham Court Road Tube Station, Oxford Street and the British Museum on Russell Square, and if you feel like ""pushing the boat out"" then this is the hotel for you!
Well done to all the staff & management, keep up the great work and thank you for such a pleasant stay, we will return!

",5,2016,08,10
115,You won't be disappointed,Fabulous from arrival to departure. Hot hand towels when we checked in and London back pack badges on leaving. Friendly. Welcoming. Knowledgeable colleagues throughout the hotel.  Nice to be looked after by people who actually seemed to enjoy their jobs. Oh and the bed was very comfortable.,5,2016,08,09
115,Wonderful Boutique Hotel in Great Location on a Quiet Street,"Yesterday our family of four returned from London after a 5 day stay at the Bloomsbury.  

From beginning to end, it was a fabulous experience.  Every staff member we encountered was helpful, courteous, professional and friendly.

(special shout outs to Maria in the Club Restaurant who led our frenzied effort at putting together a to go breakfast so that we could make our 8 am walking tour that started at Tower Hill.  And to Pablo at the concierge desk whose knowledge of the geography, public transportation, and restaurants added tremendously to the success of our experience).

The rooms are beautifully appointed, clean, and quiet.

For our purposes the location was FABULOUS.  There is an underground station a block and a half away(Tottenham Court).  The Bloomsbury is a 15-30 minute walk from almost all of the West End theatres (we saw three excellent shows), and a 30-40 minute walk to the Thames, Parliament, St. Paul's Cathedral, London Eye, etc.  Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden, Chinatown and more....all easy walks.  The hotel is located on a quiet side street off of Charing Cross

If you are looking for a well appointed smaller hotel with excellent staff in a great location for touring we highly recommend The Bloomsbury Hotel.",5,2016,08,09
115,Birthday booking for my wife,Simply faultless. We arrived after a 3 hour drive from Birmingham to be presented with hot towels to refresh ourselves whilst checking in which was a lovely touch and set the tone for the remainder of our one night stay. Beautiful room with impeccable service and an outstanding breakfast the following morning made for an exquisite experience which was much needed. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.,5,2016,08,08
115,"Very posh, polite staff and fabulous rooms ",The rooms were incredible. We got this on secret hotels and was a bargain! The rooms were gorgeous and the restaraunt is not to be missed! Staff went out of their way to help you with your needs and the conciarge was very informative. Love the modern yet middle eastern theme to the hotel! Smelled amazing too!  ,5,2016,08,07
115,beautiful hotel. wonderful staff,"I expected a beautiful hotel and that's exactly what I got. It's amazingly comfortable with very plush and welcoming rooms. The breakfast and the dinner in the restaurant was excellent. All my needs where not only met they where exceeded. A special mention to their wonderful staff especially Maria at breakfast every morning. She is exceptional at her job and a real asset to the hotel. There are many wonderful properties around London, it is the staff that makes the Bloomsbury stand out for me.",5,2016,08,07
115,Great place for the night in ideal location,"Stayed here with my partner and his parents for one night, Saturday. The staff here are just so personal and really make you feel welcome and looked after. We had afternoon tea and had more sandwiches brought out and was not rushed to finish. We had a show in the evening and this was in walking distance from the hotel. 
We booked direct via the hotels website and received credit to the room towards drinks and food and also reception gave us a complimentary upgrade. 
The room was lovely, king size bed, spacious and a really comfy bed.
The bar is a gorgeous little place, I had a salad there from the Al a Carte menu and it was yummy.
Breakfast was amazing, went down about 8-15, sometimes with these London hotels breakfast at weekend can be manic, but this one was calm. Maria in the restaurant was just lovely, very personable and spending time with the customers. 
I have been lucky enough to stay in many London hotels, this is definitely one of my favourites and one to return to.
",5,2016,08,07
115,A Charming Hotel,"This was our first visit to London, from Canada. We stayed at the hotel for a week. From our moment of arrival, we felt very welcome. All staff that we encountered were very helpful. We appreciated the concierge and the doorman who helped with directions to various attractions and with transportation whether by taxi, bus, or tube. The location near both tube and bus was great. Breakfast was a treat with great buffets as well as menu choices available. Dinners on the Terrace were lovely - nicely served and very tasty.  We hope to return some day!",5,2016,08,06
115,A Brilliant Treat,"After several work trips staying in the hotels closest to my office I went just a little further away. Right on the Central tube line and 4 quick stops away, staying at the Bloomsbury was a treat. 

Hotel staff is welcoming. Concierge was engaging and so easily helped me get tickets to a show. The restaurant is a delight and although I dread eating on my own when I travel the staff was so warm and kind that I enjoyed my experience and the food was wonderful too. 

Lobby is lovely. Room was cozy. Location was a great jumping off point for my weekend as well as work needs. 

I will be back Bloomsbury!!",5,2016,08,05
115,"Beautiful bar, wonderful staff","Business turned to pleasure at the wonderful Bloomsbury Club Bar.  After a successful business meeting, myself and a colleague stayed on to enjoy the wonderful surroundings and amazing service from Mathieu, the Bar Manager and his wonderful team.  We were treated with care and professionalism and the staff greatly added to the fun of the evening.  I would recommend this place to anyone and will definitely be returning myself.",5,2016,08,05
115,London short break,"Booked to stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel. Staff are all very friendly and smart, nothing to much for them. Rooms are clean and very presentable, would love to stay here again. Central  to everything, Oxford Street just around the corner, for the people who enough the shops ",5,2016,08,04
115,Cheeky little theatre weekend,Excellent location for the theatre had a upgrade to a lovely room from what was an ok room but small. Great breakfast with very wide choice including full English. Lovely terrace restaurant and drinks area nice for late cocktails. Bit pricey but that's what you pay for.,5,2016,08,04
115,Great hotel in a great location!,"Two years ago, we stayed at The Nadler Soho when we visited London.  We loved it but wanted to try a different hotel this time around, and we wanted to stay in a neighborhood nearby.  We took a chance with The Bloomsbury, and we are happy we did!
The hotel is a perfect blend of modern and classic.  We had a small but cozy room that overlooked the Dalloway Terrace restaurant.  Though you can somewhat hear the conversations and music from down below, the noise level was low and we were glad that the window opened to let in the breeze and fresh air.  The location was walking distance next to some great areas - Soho, Hoxton, Mayfair, etc. - and it was near some fine dining as well as casual and inexpensive restaurants. There's even a movie theatre 2 blocks away where we saw movies as a way of being cool during the hot summer evenings. 
The staff was very friendly and helpful.  A couple of noteworthy employees:
Julia, Guest Relations Manager -- accommodating and knowledgeable;
Pablo, Bellman -- friendly and always ready to help;
Cezara, Staffer at The Juice Bar -- made great smoothies (she makes a mean Mercer smoothie w/ extra ginger!) and one of the friendliest people we met during our entire vacation.
An area of improvement involved the weekend housekeeping staff: one day, it seemed like our room was only halfway restocked because we didn't get a bathmat, new coffee/tea, glassware, etc.
All in all, a great choice for a perfect vacation!",4,2016,08,03
115,Anniversary break ,"Best hotel we've stayed at in London. Staff very attentive and efficient. Handy locality for West end. Hotel is in tip top condition no signs of wear as in some of the hotels we've stayed in. 
Drinks a little pricy. But would like to go back soon. ",5,2016,08,03
115,Great location; excellent service,"My husband and I just returned from a week at The Bloomsbury with our 13 year old granddaughter.  It was a wonderful and memorable experience.  With excellent help and guidance from the Concierge and his associate, we easily found our way to, from, and into all the sights we had on our itinerary as well as suggestions made by them -- including places nearby to eat.. The Bloomsbury has an excellent location -- easy to walk, take the tube, or a bus -- and while just off a busy road, is very quiet. The Bloomsbury also earned a lot of stars because we were able to have inter-connected rooms, giving us privacy but closeness which was very important to us.  The food in the Dalloway Terrace was very good (the butternut squash risotto was a special favorite of our granddaughter). The staff, to a person, were friendly and welcoming to us all. We all would return and we will definitely recommend it to friends!",5,2016,08,03
115,Perfect place to stay in London,"I recently stayed at the Bloomsbury with my husband and 2 teenagers. From the moment we arrived, the staff at the hotel made us feel welcomed and special. The person at the reception desk was very nice and made sure we had a good experience checking in, the two porters were incredible attentive and helpful, always with a smile. We got two separate rooms: a deluxe queen, which was perfect and had extra room, and a twin for the kids, which allowed everyone to have space. Both rooms were done well and very comfortable. Did not need anything extra. 
We had breakfast at the hotel twice but opted to go for different options the rest of the week, for variety-sake. We also had cocktails at the bar twice (really good drinks and the bartender was funny and very knowledgeable), and dinner at the Terrace restaurant once - the food was excellent and the service perfect. Would definitely recommend trying it!
The location of the hotel is great: close to Covent Gardens and Soho and about 1/2 away from the British Museum. The Tube is just around the corner, and Oxford Street and lots of shopping options are within walking distance as well.
When we go back to London, we will definitely stay at the Bloomsbury again! Thanks for making our stay in London a great one!",5,2016,08,02
115,Glad we found the Bloomsbury,"Like finding a boutique hotel before it gets trendy. A Very nice hotel in our favorite part of town.  Super nice room.  Recently renovated from an old YWCA.
Looking forward to staying here again, and wish we had time to use more of the facilities on offer.
Eve's cafe opposite is a real London cafe from another Era.
Close to British museum, Soho, Covent garden and major north rail hubs.",5,2016,08,01
115,Wonderful Hotel,The hotel was really wonderful. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The room and the public areas were all very clean and tidy. I would recommend The Bloomsbury and definitely stay there again.  We had a great time and the location was perfect. ,5,2016,08,01
115,Great weekend,This was booked as a shopping weekend with my nice to celabrate her 18th. The hotel had decorated her room with ballots and had left chocolates when we arrived this was a nice touch and made a good start to are stay. Hotel lovely the rooms are comfortable. The restaurants and bars are great. The staff are very helpful and friendly nothing was to much trouble. Would really. recommend making this the hotel to book for any trip to London.,5,2016,08,01
115,Wonderful Afternoon Tea Experience,My husband and I visited this hotel for afternoon tea yesterday. From the moment we entered this beautiful hotel we were taken care of with nothing too much trouble and every attention to detail catered for . The afternoon tea was beautiful with free flowing bubbles all served by a lovely Portugese Restaurant Manager.Thank you for a wonderful experience! Would highly recommend .,5,2016,07,31
115,Weekend trip,"Me and the hubby booked a weekend package to see Romeo and Juliet and for a nights stay at the Bloomsbury.

The hotel was amazing. Beautiful and clean. Staff really friendly and helpful.

The room was a little smaller then I thought it would be but was big enough fore and my husband. The room was really clean and had everything we needed. It even had air conditioning that you could control yourself. The bed was very comfortable. There were also blackout curtains making the room nice and dark in the evening.

The bar and staff in the bar were lovely. Drinks expensive but then it is a very lovely hotel and was a treat for us.

The hotel was very close to all the theaters and tube station.

You can leave your bags at the hotel on the day of arrival if you are there before check in and also on the day you check out if you want to do some more sight seeing. This was very useful.

On check out we were given free bottles of water for the day as well which I thought was a really nice touch.

I would highly reccomend a stay here.",5,2016,07,31
115,Wonderful Stay!,"After a long day of travel, was greeted with warmth and what I interpreted as a genuine desire to make the day end on a better note than it had started.  Everyone was friendly, courteous and committed to doing their best.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, everyone we encountered was wonderful.  The experience we had was that we had found a home away from home.  Would definitely recommend staying at The Bloomsbury and will stay there again when we return!  ",5,2016,07,30
115,Not a high flyer - The Hotel was!,"Don't usually go into London often, but when in Rome don't stay at a travel lodge, pardon the pun.  Perfect service and accommodation you pay for what you get - perfection ;) nice terrace Bar and visit the cellar!",5,2016,07,29
115,A luxurious and relaxing week in this hotel,"We spent a week in this beautiful hotel that had been designed by Edwin Lutyens, known for all of the British buildings in Delhi and the magnificent Somme memorial. Our room was large and supplied with a coffee maker and tea kettle. Each night, for turn down, we were given chocolates plus cookies. As a surprise for our anniversary, we were given chocolate covered strawberries. The staff was extremely kind, polite and helpful especially the knowledgeable concierge, Pablo who gave us a special tour of the original library and chapel. Location was perfect for walking, for taking the Underground and for eating.",5,2016,07,29
115,Incredible hotel for our first visit to London,"We planned a trip (my wife and I) with our son for a week in London, and we wanted a hotel close to the West End with distinctive British charm.  The Bloomsbury caught our eye as a possibility, and it surpassed every expectation and then some!

First, the staff was amazing.  Clearly customer service is alive and well in this hotel.  They were friendly, attentive, and went well out of their way to ensure that we had everything we wanted or needed throughout our stay.  For example, my wife and I were enjoying some tea and dessert in the lobby one night while our son relaxed up in the room.  In a conversation with our server, we mentioned that our son really wanted to try creme brûlée.  Sure enough, when we returned the next day after a day out sightseeing, there was a creme brûlée waiting for him to try!  As I said, incredible staff who got to know us as guests and provided impeccable service.

Second,  the location is perfect.  Located near the West End, it's within walking distance of all the theaters, the British Museum, Trafalgar Square, Westminster Abbey/Houses of Parliament/etc.  London of course is a walking city but we spent a week and barely scratched the surface of the West End and the neighboring areas.  

Third, the hotel itself and the amenities were top notch.  From the comfy beds, to the generous showers/tubs, the relaxed patio, the cozy bar area, to the delicious food served in their restaurants...we woke every morning to a full English (with plenty of other options), and finished the day with a drink or dessert and tea.  Awesome, delicious food!

I can't recommend The Bloomsbury enough to anyone looking for a hotel oozing with charm, with a staff dedicated to making each and every guest feel special.  We will be back to visit this amazing hotel again!",5,2016,07,29
115,Exceptionally good visit,"I was in town for meetings, The Bloomsbury was very central for them, but I could also wonder down through Soho within minutes.  Location sounds like it's going to be hussley and noisy, but really isn't - very peaceful feel to the hotel, elegantly styled and well maintained.
Most impressive though was the service - the right balance of friendliness, respect, formality but with a smile, etc., but what seemed a genuine enthusiasm to help from every single encounter I had from the reception to the breakfast to the attached restaurant.  Quite impressive and meant I was able to hold my meetings on site without hesitation.
The combination of location, style, comfort, welcome, service, peace and quality was  enough to make this a regular hotel for when I've got to be in the centre of town again.",5,2016,07,29
115,a good hotel in a good location,very good hotel in a very good location and  very close to Tottenam Court tube station. I've enjoined of a large and cleaning room. The Gym is small but essential. Sometimes the service is not good as you expect as an Hotel like this.  I has been not so satisfaied about the breakfast too: not so various and good considering the price.  ,4,2016,07,28
115,A big helping of luxury loveliness!,"Spent the most amazing night at the Bloomsbury last week. Everything about this place oozes relaxed luxury. Courteous check-in (with fresh lemonade on offer) and pre-setting your room temperature. My room was delightful - spacious, classy and relaxing. Great bathroom too (with heated floor and tv!). A lovely plate of fresh fruit and pastries awaiting my arrival was a nice touch too. Lovely breakfast cooked fresh with helpful and attentive staff",5,2016,07,27
115,Great for business,"A centrally located hotel off Tottenham Court Road. Easy access from the tube station. We had a business meeting and lunch in the restaurant. Very good food and good service. We booked a meeting room and it was well services with coffee, tea and biscuits all day!
Perfect location if you want to head into London. ",4,2016,07,27
115,once again,"our second time here, just as good if not better than last time, the location for the theatres oxford street etc to all the brilliant staff- Brian at the door THAN housekeeping, and Maria in restaurant all excellent, great place to stay.",5,2016,07,26
115,Top Notch Hotel with a Wonderful Staff!,We just finished a week's stay at the Bloomsbury and had a wonderful time!  We were traveling with our youngest son and the staff was so accommodating.  A woman working in the Lobby bar heard that he wanted to try creme brûlée and the next day one was waiting for him as we arrived back from sight seeing!  Our morning waitstaff suggested we try the bar one night and so sent our son milk and biscuits to the room that night!  We had breakfast included in our package and we really enjoyed the buffet and the choices of hot entrees.  The service was always excellent!  The location is great between the West End and across the street from the British Museum!  We would definitely stay here again if traveling to London!  Thank you for a really great vacation!,5,2016,07,25
115,"Good hotel, excellent location","A favorite when in London, location, breakfast, room, service. I love the interior in the tea room area. But still I find that the prices has increased more than others for the last couple of years, so I have actually stayed in other hotels in the nearby area, with better price/value. Please do something about that, and I would love to come back next time going to London. ",4,2016,07,25
115,Comfortable stay,"The staff at Reception were friendly and helpful.
The staff at breakfast (particularly Georgi, Estelita and Maria) were the best breakfast room staff I have ever come across.
It was such a pleasure to be cheerfully greeted with happy, smiling faces every morning.
The breakfast itself was also delicious and I really enjoyed the eggs with salmon.

I was fortunate to be upgraded. The room was very comfortable although typically London it was still quite small. London is not a city where you feel you get value for money in an hotel. That is not a criticism of this hotel; it's just that in all hotels in London you seem to pay a lot and not get very much.
Wifi was fast and reliable.

The bathroom was clean and functional. 
The only thing I didn't like was that I was close to the lift and despite the door to my room being timber it may as well have been made from paper as I could hear every conversation between other guests on their way to the elevator.",4,2016,07,25
115,Bloomsbury Hotel,"Excellent location and a very pleasant atmosphere.  The breakfast was particularly good, especially the absence of the usual lukewarm hotel buffet.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.  The only downside is that even for London the room and bathroom were small - we had a superior room and I don't think it was what I would define as superior.  Nevertheless, we would stay there again.",4,2016,07,25
115,Wonderful stay in an historic grand hotel.,"We had an excellent stay at The Bloomsbury. It is a magnificent historical building. The staff, especially those at breakfast and the doormen, were very courteous and friendly. The room was spacious for European standards, comfortable and immaculately clean.",5,2016,07,23
115,Great Stay,"As a family, we stayed for 5 nights in two rooms at the Bloomsbury. The hotel was decorated very well; the staff was friendly and helpful; and the rooms were well appointed. We had breakfast included in our stay and it was a great way to start the day. Maria and the whole staff were enjoyable, friendly and infinitely accommodating. Additionally, Maria tried her best outside of breakfast to make our stay really A1. This hotel is very well run....",5,2016,07,22
115,Lovely stay,My wife and I decided to book a hotel to celebrate our anniversary.The location of the hotel is perfect as it is just a short walk to the theatres and Oxford street for shopping. We have everything we need in our room so it was a lovely stay.,4,2016,07,22
115,Wonderful place to stay when visiting London,The hotel was recommended by a friend.  I was not disappointed to say the least.  The location is convenient to all attractions.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  Rooms are clean and so is the hotel.  Wifi worked without any issues.  Loved the turndown service.  Bathrooms are all updated and CLEAN.  Will return to stay here should I visit the city.,5,2016,07,21
115,Leisure ,"Great location  for theatres , very good breakfast . Attentive staff . Front desk and checking in and out was quick and no fuss . Hot towels and complementary water on departure was a nice touch . The. Room had a small window and was rather dark but overall was satisfactory . Nice stay .   ",4,2016,07,21
115,Outstanding,"If you get the chance you will love to stay at this hotel.I was so impressed by the attention to detail and what a personal experience it was,which is not common in London. Staff very friendly and always on hand.",5,2016,07,20
115,"Well located, excellent service","Stayed while at a conference for 6 days in July. I stayed in a standard double room on the 7th floor which was cozy but well appointed. There was no separate shower but a bath/shower combo which was fine. The room was very comfortable and had a Nespresso and nice selection of tea and coffee. The overall feel was of understated luxury. The gym was small but well equiped. Breakfast was continental and I paid upgraded option of additional cooked breakfast. The continental spread was all you would need but it was nice to have the cooked options as they added nice variety. Maria in the dining room was lovely. The hotel is a great place to stay centrally as you are very close to Oxford St, Tottenham Court Road and British Museum. The Tottenham Court tube station is about 3 mins walk from the hotel. Overall well worth the money!",5,2016,07,19
115,Excellent service! Thank you!,"We celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary last July 3, 2016 in one of the hotel's halls. The staff was very friendly, helpful  and accommodating, they make us comfortable and less stressed to prepare our event. The food was organised and prepared by chef Paul was delicious! 
The staff in the restaurant, Maria and her colleagues, thank you for your support.
I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends. Excellent location! accessible to anything! 👍🏻",5,2016,07,19
115,Lovely hotel in Holborn,This hotel is a gem with wonderful staff and service and a great location. The Terrace and bar serve great drinks and food. It is as much a hotel for business travellers as newly weds. Highly recommended!,5,2016,07,19
115,Amazing food and great staff!,"If you are visiting London for the first time and want to explore the city, ask the staff of Bloomsbury hotel. They are all very knowledgeable about the various points of interest around their location and can refer you to various activities you can do during your stay. 

On one occasion, while I was enjoying their wonderful breakfast, I just happen to ask Estelita (Dining) about traditional afternoon english tea. I've never experienced it and wanted to do a proper tea. So glad that she referred me to Dalloway Terrace which was simply in the lobby of Bloomsbury hotel (upstairs). I saved myself a trip to some unknown place but at the same time had a lovely experience at Dalloway. The food was delicious and pretty. It was nice to be able to take my time to enjoy a proper afternoon tea.",5,2016,07,18
115,Great for holiday or conference,"Very high quality service here from check-in onwards. The room was very comfortable- excellent bathroom facilities and supplies. Your own pod coffee machine too. Even a bed side umbrella in case in rains while you sleep ;-) The curtains are black- lined and keep out all light- suggest setting your alarm!
Conference facilities good, including the meals. 
My only gripe was the high security fridge - impossible to pop your own items in without contacting reception.",5,2016,07,16
115,A very impressive hotel in an excellent location,"This was the most central hotel we've stayed at in London. It's situated in leafy Bloomsbury, less than five minutes walk from Tottenham Court Road station or the British Museum. 

The hotel itself is a magnificent building, designed by Lutyens (the hotel provides charmingly twee information booklets in the rooms about the building and its history). Such hotels, especially somewhere like London, can feel a little fussy, but the Bloomsbury had a relaxed yet professional atmosphere that immediately put us at ease. Pedro at reception was particularly welcoming, but everyone was impressive. The rooms are very stylishly decorated, with a good range of toiletries, a Nespresso machine, and free wifi. The bathroom was beautifully tiled and the shower water pressure was excellent. Most importantly, for central London, the room was very big. 

At night, the hotel was quiet, and the bed very comfortable. We had a cocktail in the downstairs bar, which was very cosy and quite delicious. Our only regret was that we were only staying one night - we would definitely stay here again. I'm already looking forward to our next trip to London!

It might seem fairly expensive, but I've paid similar money to stay in places that don't even come close to this. The location, large rooms, and, crucially, the service, mean that it's actually very good value for money.",5,2016,07,15
115,People make the experience worthwhile,"When traveling for work, one tends to miss the comforts of home. But in my recent stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel, Maria and Estelita (Dining)  and their staff made great efforts to make my stay so wonderful. It's from the little things of knowing your name,  what you have ordered on your previous day, to how you take your coffee, to making sure you have a cup of coffee to take with you.

The service industry is underrated, but it's people like Maria and Estelita's hospitality, care and passion that shows through that a personal connection is made which makes such a big difference versus just a simple transaction of being ""served"". They don't ""serve"",  they take care of their guests and that's the biggest difference. 

The breakfast buffet at the hotel is wonderful as well! Top notch quality food and their menu is wonderful- varied and delicious. 

The only feedback I would give is to have a list of prices of the mini bar items for guests to be aware of it.",5,2016,07,14
115,Excellent stay at The Bloomsbury,"Wonderful stay at The Bloomsbury.  We found all staff to be extremely cheerful and welcoming at this gorgeous hotel in the heart of the town.  Stylish, comfortable rooms and The Bloomsbury Bar is well worth a visit for a early evening or late night cocktail! I would have no hesitation in recommending this lovely hotel.",5,2016,07,13
115,Charmimg Hotel,"We loved this hotel.

The hotel atmosphere is welcoming and the rooms super cosy.

Its location is superb.

Value for money is at the top end.

When we come to London next time we will definitely stay here again.

Thats got to be a good recommendation considering how fussy we both are.",5,2016,07,12
115,40th birthday get away,"We selected the Bloomsbury for its great location, super staff and impeccable standards. We had four nights in London to celebrate my girlfriends 40th and would recommend the hotel without hesitation. The hotel is in an ideal location and near the tube station and not far from London Euston. The staff we kind, friendly and professional. We especially liked Mathew the cocktail barman who gave us endless knowledge about the history of the hotel and the drinks that he served. It was nice to find someone with a real passion for his work. Overall a really enjoyable stay. ",5,2016,07,12
115,Excellent Stay,"Recently stayed here for a Business event which covered the event itself and a 1 night stopover.  Overall, my stay merits an excellent rating due to a variety of positives:  1) brilliant location   2) classy establishment  3)  fantastic event rooms  4) exquisite food at the event  5) friendly staff . . . . the list is endless!
Brilliant!",5,2016,07,12
115,First impression very good,"Came across this hotel by chance whilst poking for a overnight stay.

In the mid price range but very pleased with the selection, having stayed in a variety of hotels in the city this will defiantly be a hotel we will use again.

Lovely decor and good quality bedding which can sometimes be lacking..

",5,2016,07,11
115,Convenient and friendly,"We stayed here for five nights in May. 

Pros: 
Beautiful decor
Comfy room, great bed
Friendly staff
Location!

Cons:
Staff very busy, often forgot little things. Example: they would ask if I wanted ice in my juice or not and then bring me ice if I didn't want it or vice versa. Something like this happened every day. Small things, did not matter much or ruin my stay in any way. Still, a slight annoyance. ",5,2016,07,08
115,Great stay.,"I was in London on business for a couple of days and booked to stay at The Bloomsbury.
My arrival was delayed, so I phoned ahead to let reception know.
On arrival the check in was very pleasant after my long journey.
My room was very clean and had everything that I needed, including a welcome arrangement of fruit nuts and a muffin! Plus a handwritten welcome note - which was a nice touch!
After a sound nights sleep I was ready for the full English breakfast - which set me up for the day!
The staff are all well trained, friendly and helpful. 
The bar is very well stocked and the bar staff are great!
I would recommend the hotel whole heartedly - and certainly be returning!
",5,2016,07,08
115,Amaizing hotel in the heart of London!,"This old building that The Bloomsbury Hotel occupaies is just amaizing, plus, it has a great location - on a quite street right off Oxford. Add to it the great staff that always greet you and willing to help - and you have the perfect hotel. 
Standart room are small (Although. all capital cities in Europe have hotels with small rooms) - so I would suggest to book the bigger ones.",4,2016,07,07
115,"The Bloomsbury, great service and location",Stayed her for 4 nights with my 2 teenage daughters. We were upgraded to a Deluxe room so were able to put a foldout bed in the sitting area. Staff was very friendly from opening doors to providing a corkscrew and bucket of ice for our wine bottle. Location is on a quiet street yet close to Tottenham Court Underground station and the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street. Interior is tasteful combining historical ambiance with modern features. Would love to come back.,5,2016,07,07
115,Excellent Venue,"I'm a semi-regular at the Bloomsbury, but this stay was particularly good. I arrived early (10am) just to drop off bag and go, and was pleasantly surprised to find a room available. I got back late, and the staff were as friendly and welcoming as ever.

Very few hotels *genuinely* can make you feel at home, but the Bloomsbury is one of them.",5,2016,07,06
115,"Wonderful Hotel, Superb Service, Great Location","First of all, I would like to commend the wonderful staff at The Bloomsbury who work day and night to please their guests and take care of all the needs. 
This has been my first time at The Bloomsbury, as I've been given great reviews about this hotel from colleagues.  The hotel is centrally located, right by Tottenham Court Road tube station. Lobby and public facilities are all decorated beautifully with ""gentlemen's club"" style. Staff is so attentive, polite and always ready to help.  Room was super clean, modern with chic, with many treats (rooms are being serviced TWICE a day), chocolates by the bed every night, good shower amenities, complimentary bottles of water every day etc. 
Unfortunately, did not have the time to visit the dining options, but hotel seem to have great restaurant by the lobby and an even greater bar.  fitness center is available for guests as well.  
To summarize:  A GREAT EXPERIENCE, very satisfied customer, wonderful hotel. will definitely come back for future trips. 
Highly recommended. 

Cheers.",5,2016,07,05
115,So Central and convenient,"I was treated to a night at the Bloomsbury for my 60th by my wife in April 2016.  We drove from the West Country and once the London traffic had been fought we parked up in a separate underground car park where the car remained for the weekend.  After a very short walk towing our cases (basically cross the road plus about 30 yards) we were checked into our room and our luggage was delivered by an efficient and polite porter.  The room, whilst not large had a comfortable bed, shower on suite and the usual amenities like Tea & Coffee, mini bar etc.

My wife had booked an early theatre dinner at £20 per head which proved to be delicious. The pea and Watercress soup was fantastic and genuinely worth a special mention.",4,2016,07,04
115,Great stay at Bloomsbury!!,"Clean, comfortable, very friendly staff, and great food! I would definitely stay here again in the future. The hotel was centrally located which made it convenient to walk to all the great restaurants and the West End. ",5,2016,07,04
115,AVA'S First Birthday Celebration ,"The hotel is well located where any guests invited to any occasions held is accessible to amenities . Right on the Russell Square , central London which you can find the hotel near the underground transport or buses . On Ava's birthday we find interesting things very commendable about the venue . Big enough for 12 or 16 tables to fit in , high ceilings that the chandeliers dominate the grandeur of the room . The food being served are sumptuous , our invited guests have enjoyed the three courses buffet dinner that nothing is left on the table . Everyone has come home with big smiles on their faces and would like to thank Ms Pilar ,Ms Maria & the chef Paul for their excellent service worth of good service they have done making Ava's birthday a success . ",5,2016,07,03
115,Would definitely return!,"The hot towel upon check-in at the desk was a wonderful surprise. Our room was updated, quiet, neat, and clean. The only complaint was the air-con -- we could never seem to get the room cool enough to our satisfaction. Dined three times in the newer inside/outside patio restaurant. Each meal, we had something different, all of it good.

All the staff we interacted with and spoke to were highly professional and extremely helpful. Kudos to management for excellent training and hiring wonderful people.

As we stayed three nights, the proximity to the tube was so convenient, and LOVED that the British Museum was mere steps away. The perfect location for this leg of our London visit. Would not hesitate to book here again or recommend it to my friends.",4,2016,07,03
115,1st Birthday party,"We have recommended to have my close friend to have their baby girl 1st birthday to be celebrated in Bloomsbury Hotel as we have also celebrated ours before. I am very pleased with the staff service especially the Head chief Sir Paul and Maria who had made sure that all was the day is absolute perfect. Big thanks again Sir Paul and Maria for the support, the great delicious  food and recommendations. We will surely come back and would recommend more of our friends to visit Bloomsbury Hotel.",5,2016,07,03
115,"Good hotel, avoid the 8th (top) floor","I actually liked this hotel, but I hated my room and floor.

The hotel itself is situated perfectly; literally 1 block from the British Museum.  Also, there's an inexpensive laundry place around the corner (very convenient).  Breakfast is tasty and great!  And wifi was good.

Now, to my room.  The 8th floor has low ceilings everywhere.  I'm not tall, and I could touch the ceiling with my hand.  Also, part of the room was slanted (making it even lower).  Moreover, the bathroom had that weird half shower door that makes it really difficult to take a shower.

I'd be fine going back as long as I did not get a room on the 8th floor.",3,2016,07,03
115,Very pleasant,I enjoyed my stay and loved the location in close proximity to metro plus the bar area and outside restaurant were big plusses - the food was lovely. Found the rooms clean and nicely themed with personal touch. Overall the hotel has wonderful character. Will go back there!,4,2016,07,02
115,A very good hotel in a good location !,"The staff was very nice and helping.
The room clean and comfortable.
Houskeeping was great.
Location - very close to tube station and important attractions on city center.
We had our breakfasts outside the hotel and found many nice places nearby.

We will come again :-)",5,2016,07,02
115,Center of London,"Stayed 4 nights in June. Hot towel at check in was very nice. Fast check in and check out. Great location, couple of blocks from tube. Came in late couple of nights but still few people around so felt safe. 
Only minor item was that room walls are thin so we were able hear next door. 
I would stay here again. 
",4,2016,07,01
115,Another great stay,"I have just returned from my second stay at the Bloomsbury and can only say that it was lovely. Its a beautiful hotel with some interesting history with good facilities. When we first visited I was surprised at how close it was to Covent Garden, the theatres and Oxford and Regent Street so a really ideal location for all sorts of holiday options.",5,2016,07,01
115,Highly Recommended,"I've been to London several times and this is, by far, the nicest place I've stayed and I might well stay here every time in the future if I can get a decent price!   The location is fantastic, within an easy walk of the Tottenham Court Tube station, the British Museum, the  University of London, and a very doable walk to the British Library, Covent Garden, Trafalgar Sq, and Oxford Circus.  The hotel itself is beautiful outside and inside.  It has    a grand, well-appointed lobby and the public spaces and a really delightful outdoor terrace restaurant, which was great for an occasional breakfast or dinner.  (I never got to the pub below).  The staff and service were consistently great.  The room was nice as well and the bathroom especially so (it was spacious and had fine details.)  My only complaint is that the storage was very limited, and that was for just one person.  There was limited space to hang clothes and virtually no drawers.  To work at the desk I had to move things off and set them on the floor and  the cleaning people routinely put things right back, so I had to do this regularly.  I would suggest a few unobtrusive hooks for the walls.   In all, however, it was a terrific hotel and a very enjoyable stay.  I recommend it highly.",5,2016,06,30
115,"Great service, location & overall stay","We had a great stay at the Bloomsbury. The room was not huge - but for the 2 of us it was just fine. We spent most of our day sightseeing, not in our room. Plenty big enough for relaxing, showering & sleeping. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was very modern & chic and the Nespresso maker was an awesome bonus. They offered turn-down service every evening (with chocolates!) and the bar in the lower level was amazing. We enjoyed wonderful cocktails & live jazz. We also would recommend the restaurant, Dalloway Terrace. The food & service there were exceptional. And with the great location- down the street from the British Museum, close to the tube & bus stops, we would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,06,28
115,"Beautiful hotel, interiors and rooms! Check out pub downstairs","Loved this hotel, even though for a few nights. Very helpful staff. The first room we got was too small, so I upgraded for 25 GBP, and that made all the difference. Totally worth the extra to get a bigger room.  Great entry space and downstairs bar after a long day's work.",5,2016,06,27
115,Lovely stay at the Bloomsbury,"The Bloomsbury is a great hotel, just a short walk from Oxford Street in one direction and the fantastic British Museum in another. The hotel lobby is beautiful and the rooms are luxurious and comfortable. This is one of my favorite hotels when coming to London.",5,2016,06,27
115,Great hotel,"What a lovely hotel - Definately worth 5 stars. 
The room was clean and bed really comfy.  And free wifi. 
We also had the full English breakfast - which was delicious. 
One staff member was extremely helpful - Jero - and a real credit to this hotel. 
We will Definately be back soon. 
Lisa",5,2016,06,26
115,Standard size rooms for kids only 😒,"I'm 6ft tall and the bed in a standard room is slightly wider than my kids single bed at home and laying length ways my feet hung off the end by a few inches.
There is a very small wardrobe for hanging clothes and a mini safe.
Coffee machine, iron and hair drier provided
The bathroom is modern but tiny, again using the toilet I have literally no leg room to the left or right. The toilet paper is soft but quality reminded me of a Spanish apartment hotel.
For a high class hotel these small touches make a big difference and in reference to the size of the room, the price should be marked down and noted the bed is more suitable for a single person traveling.

Breakfast- the staff are very polite, the room is clean and modern, the chef should be fired!!  The Buffett area is fine and a good selection of food is available.
I ordered the full English, the poached eggs had been cooked but allowed to dry, so the outside was Matt, dry and cold, the black pudding was so dry it was to be described as a biscuit and the 2 bacon rashes were burnt and crisp.  The sausage was good 😬. They also had potatoe cake which looked like mash in a square which had 'splodged' onto the plate, I did not even try this but partner did and her face changed when she tried to eat it.
Her own meal was eggs Benedict and  was poorly presented, cheap ham, cheesy hollandaise sauce, undercooked muffin and a side of black pudding also dry.
I do not lie when I say this is one of the worst breakfast I've ever had from ANY hotel, cafe or restaurant and for 4 star or higher hotel it was a total let down.

Location and decor is the only positive I can take from this visit",3,2016,06,26
115,nice hotel with a few problems,"on the whole this is a very nice hotel with something just a bit off with the housekeeping.  First the positives:
great location, quiet street (excellent Indian restaurant right across the street), five minute walk to the tube
very friendly staff - I especially appreciated the young man at the concierge desk, the bellmen, and the room service staff.
The room and bed were quite comfortable.
The restaurant was excellent - had both dinner and lunch there and enjoyed both thoroughly - good wait staff, excellent food (try the minted pea soup)
The only complaint was that the housekeeping was oddly off for a such a high quality hotel.  I got the impression that maybe the person in charge of our floor had too many rooms to handle - toiletries not replaced, things a bit rumpled, one day all the lights left on.  One incident was annoying at the time (and an indication that maybe the problem is a top down one) and now quite funny in retrospect.  We returned from a day of sightseeing to find that there was only a very little toilet paper left in the room and no replacement in sight.  We called down to housekeeping and was informed that they hadn't gotten their expected delivery of toilet paper and so didn't have any on hand, but would send us up a box of tissues.  In a five star hotel - really?  We suggested they send one of the nice young staff members out to a grocery store to buy some replacements.  When we returned from dinner there was a fresh roll in our room (we wondered if they had taken it from another room - lol).

but other than that - a very nice stay.",4,2016,06,25
115,"Great location, nice hotel but something was missing","I enjoyed staying in this hotel overall. The location is prime and the room was nice enough and cosy. Staff was helpful and friendly. However the let down for me was lack of decent toiletries, no complementary water and locked mini bar/fridge. I would expect more for that price and for the hotel if that standard. ",3,2016,06,24
115,WEEKEND en famillle June 2016,"Perfect Hotel, staff, bedrooms, the Bar.
Nice bicycles but they would not let me ride them!
Very good, very amicable & helpful staff.
I cannot find anything wrong but a bit expensive.
Refreshing not to be staying in a big hotel chain where everything is standardised.",4,2016,06,23
115,Stayed here for a month,"Everything about this hotel was a great experience.  The service from beginning to end was exceptional.  I had a lovely room, very spacious, with a large bathroom.  It was well located for me - close to where I went to school for a month.  It was close to Oxford St. and Tottenham Court Rd. which have any amenity you could want.  
The staff of the hotel were always helpful and friendly, responded immediately to requests but I felt they went even beyond.  They all tried to make my stay here a happy one and they succeeded.  There is also a lovely restaurant that is on a terrace beside a lane, which is bright and welcoming, especially that I'm here in summer.  The afternoon teas in the main lobby are also great.  It is a warm, cozy, place to stay.",5,2016,06,23
115,Enjoyable stay,"Overall a good stay. Lovely rooms, very clean with all the amenities. Staff a little over attentive in the breakfast room and the steps at the hotel entrance are a little awkward with luggage and it took me at least 10 minutes to get noticed in the bar, but I would stay again.",4,2016,06,23
115,Recommended,"Beautiful large lobby, convenient location, but most of all an excellent staff at the front desk and concierge areas.  As this was our first visit to London, they provided excellent information and advice.  Breakfast was very good with buffet items such as fruit, pastries, juices, etc.  Hot food and beverage items were made to order and brought to our table.  The first morning our server said I could not order only eggs and potatoes, but had to select one of the meals from the menu.  The other days the staff encouraged us to order whatever we wanted and were outstanding.

As our 4 night reservation was made as part of a tour package by a London travel agency working with our local TA, I don't know the cost, but from other reviews I see we did not have one of the better rooms.  It was dark with the window being in a corner blocked by the closet and all the light fixtures had low wattage.  The safe was located on the bottom of the tiny closet, just a few inches above the floor, so I had to lie down on the floor to use it.  The room was large enough, but the furniture arrangement made it crowded.  This might sound crazy but the back of the wooden closet from the room next door protruded into our room in the middle of a wall and it was very noisy when they moved hangers.  Otherwise, it was very quiet at the end of a hallway.  The mini-bar refrigerator could not be used for your own beverages.  Wifi was fast, but would sometimes drop the signal. The small bathroom had a high-walled tub that must be stepped over to access the showerhead, a low hanging soffit (ceiling) right next to the wall so I kept bumping my head while showering, and no light at the mirror.  I dropped something on the floor that bounced under the bed and saw that area was never vacuumed.  The large desk had lots of outlets and a nice coffee machine.  The first night we returned from dinner and saw there was turndown service, with robes and chocolates left on the bed.  The other nights we happened to be in the room when they stopped by, and declined the service, so they wouldn't give us the chocolates!

As we were hardly in our room and I know there are better ones available, this hotel is recommended for its helpful service, lovely atmosphere, and great location near a tube station, many shops, restaurants, and the British Museum.",4,2016,06,23
115,A superb hotel,"The ambience, combined with a team of attentive friendly staff, made our stay very special. Eating in The Dalloway Terrace restaurant is a great experience; the highest quality and presentation of the food offered is highly recommended.

115,Wonderful hotel in the best location,"Stayed here for 4 nights in May. The location is fantastic. At the end of Oxford Street and 3 minute walk to Tottenham Court Road Tube Station. Walking distance to Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square. We loved the hotel. Staff very friendly and when we arrived early they had a room for us. Room was lovely.  Spotless lovely bed and bathroom. Nespresso machine in room - my husband appreciated that. Loved the Dallloway Terrace where we met family for drinks, cocktails etc.  We dined there also and the dinner was very good. Overall this hotel is excellent. The decor is beautiful. We will definitely be back soon. ",4,2016,06,23
115,"Wonderful Staff, Rooms , just so, so","This Hotel has a great Location near everything and the staff is outstanding, polite and lovely. We had ordered a standard room.  It was so tiny, that it was impossible to move around the room. My wife was there with her suitcase and me with mine and carry ons and it was almost impossible to get from the bed to the door.  After complaining, the gave us a bigger room, where I had to add 24 pounds a night and that room was bigger and nicer outside of a step at the entrance so that when one walked in, if he or she was not careful they would certainty trip over the step, It happened to me 3 times. Luckily I fell on the bed. But if one is carrying packages or even a baby, then this step is dangerous.  There is a small sign(mind your step) just where to put the entrance card.",4,2016,06,23
115,Luxury hotel with great staff,"For a taste of London luxury in a central location the Bloomsbury is a must.  Having stayed there recently, and not feeling well at the time, the lady on reception was very astute and sent some honey, lemon and hot water to my room.  It's rare to find such service like this!  We also ate outside on the new restaurant terrace which is beautiful.  Thanks to all at the hotel!",5,2016,06,23
115,6 Day Stay,"We enjoyed our stay at this hotel which we chose because we like the area in which it is located. The bed was smaller than we would have ideally liked and we had minor issues with the bath not draining properly on first use and with the TV remote control not working efficiently. We appreciated getting complimentary bottles of water which were on the desk. However, in putting a bottle in the mini-bar to cool it down (there was very little free space), we had no reason to know that disturbing the contents already in it that this would result in the automatic recording of purchases from the mini-bar. We only knew of this automated procedure at the point of getting the final bill, when it appeared from the bill that we had made daily purchases. In fairness, the receptionist dealt with the situation immediately, removed all the bogus purchases from the bill and accepted that we had not purchased anything from the mini-bar.",4,2016,06,22
115,Beautiful Hotel with Olde World Charm,"This is a beautiful hotel, with great charm and ambiance. A lovely refuge from the mayhem of close-by Tottenham Court Rd, Oxford St and the British Museum.

The downstairs bar is really lovely serving great drinks in a warm snug atmosphere and the lounge area in the main lobby is also a great place to meet, drink and eat.

I had a large room with plenty of space and beautifully decorated. The bathroom was a little small but had large very thick towels - always a good thing! Also very nice toiletries and amenities.

The only things to let the place down were:
- cheap toilet paper (I never understand why decent hotels skimp on this)
- the carpet between the bathroom and the bedroom was lifting and carpet tacks were visible and therefore slightly hazardous (I forgot to mention this to the staff)

In general though a great little place",4,2016,06,21
115,Great hotel,We stayed here in June 2016 for five nights.  We had had five nights before this at a much more expensive hotel in London but much preferred this hotel.  Great location - five minutes to Tottenham Court Road station and Oxford Street and within walking distance to Chinatown and Leicester Square. When you walk into the Hotel there is a stunning reception area. The staff here couldn't be more friendly and helpful. The room itself was small but very nicely decorated and clean. We had free wifi and chocolates were left in the room at night.  Will definitely stay here again.,5,2016,06,20
115,A hidden gem from a bygone era,"My husband and I recently had an overnight stay at this beautiful hotel. From the moment we left the busy, noisy street & entered the lobby it was like stepping into another world in a different era. The ambience is elegant, charming, comfortable and intimate. All the staff were welcoming, friendly, professional, & helpful and very smartly dressed. From our bedroom to the Dalloway restaurant to the club bar the whole place is simply lovely.  We have already recommended it to our friends & have planned to return as a group in November.",5,2016,06,20
115,Wonderful short stay. Beautiful hotel!,"I was initially hesitant to book this hotel based on the pictures of the outside of the hotel. The appearance was somewhat bland and I wasn't sure if it was an indication of the inside. Don't let that fool you. This is a lovely hotel with very nice staff and accommodations. The room was very nice. We had the queen deluxe room and it was a bit on the small side but not bad for 2 people for 3 days. The hotel and room was fresh and classy. I was very glad to find out there was a US rated electrical outlet (included with other outlets in the business/vanity desk next to the bed. I only needed it for my flat iron so one was enough for me. The UK outlets work fine with an adapter for lower voltage items such as phones and tablets. A hairdryer is available in the bathroom. We did experience reception issues with the TV but we weren't in the room enough for that to be a big issue. The hotel is walking distance from many restaurants, the tube and the British Museum. The staff was very helpful and friendly. You do have to bring luggage up half a flight of stairs to enter the hotel. ",5,2016,06,19
115,"beautiful hotel, excellent location","Excellent stay, upgraded to Queen room with large bathroom, free wifi,air con, tea/coffee etc. Very helpful staff let us check in early at 12:00 (normal check in @ 2pm) 

My only criticism would be that £26 for a breakfast is incredibly steep, the options available included full english (bacon, egg, sausage etc) waffles, pancakes etc however I'd quibble paying that much for a evening meal let alone breakfast!!",5,2016,06,19
115,Perfect Location for our visit to London,"Delightful hotel, excellent location, staff is professional and friendly, food delicious. Room snug but to be expected in city location, bed very comfortable (and I have a very bad back). The lounge is very comfortable and cozy. Dinner on the Dalloway Terrace was probably the best meal we had in London. I'd go back in a heartbeat. ",5,2016,06,19
115,Great London Find,We spent 5 nights at the Bloomsbury and had a great time. Rooms were large by London standards. All the staff were wonderful especially Maria and Estelita at breakfast. Position is very handy - just down the street from the British Museum with good food nearby.,5,2016,06,19
115,An awesome stay in the World's Best City,"We are retired world history teachers and have longed to visit the city of London;and we have just finished our best international experience ever. We have traveled aboard before to Canada, Portugal,Spain,and several other Mediterranean countries.  And have stayed at several hotels but ; have never enjoyed a stay as much as we have enjoyed our stay at ""The Bloomsbury Hotel' on Great Russell Street.

We were dropped off at the wrong hotel but the welcome at the The Bloomsbury Hotel was so enthusiastic that the ""wrong dropping off"" quickly vanished from our minds.
Andre greater us ;assured us that our arrival was anticipated.  He never failed to recognises and call us by name every time we encountered him on the premises.
He assisted us with the purchase of tour tickets, making arrangements for our anniversary celebration dinner, giving us directions around town, taking pictures of us..there was no request or inquiry he did not fulfil.  Maria and the staff of the Breakfast dining area was equally as welcoming and helpful.  Ramona and Gabriel remembered us and were very accommodating.  We enjoyed all the meals, we even dined two evening at the Dalloway Terrace.",5,2016,06,17
115,Affordable lucury,"My husband stayed here for work and I joined him for the last day and a half of his stay. Check in was smooth and speedy and they even told me that he was having breakfast at Dalloway Terrace so I could go see him straight away. The hotel is beautiful and classy with a quiet and intimate feel. The scent in the hotel is divine.

The room is small (this is London) but frankly I have paid a lot more at other hotels in London for even smaller rooms. For London standards I would say the space in the room is quite generous. There is a kettle with a selection of tea, coffee and hot chocolate, a Nespresso machine, nice toiletries, bathrobe and slippers.

When I got to the room there were chocs on the bedside I suppose from turndown the night before (I arrived very early morning straight off the plane from Hong Kong), which my husband hadn't had (he's not a chocolate fan), so I happily had them.

I then left the hotel for a while to get a quick bite to eat and when I returned the room hadn't been serviced. I was really hoping they had while I was gone, since I was tired from the overnight flight and wanted to take a nap early afternoon. Housekeeping didn't come until quite late meaning I stayed up waiting for them since I didn't want them to come when I was sleeping. Finally they came at around 4pm. The cleaning ladies were swift and quiet as they cleaned around me while I read in bed. When they left I realised they hadn't left me any chocolates for the night which was disappointing but I was relieved that I could now sleep in any case.

For the price I would say the hotel is luxurious, spacious, you get everything you need in the room (great climate control in the room too), personal and efficient service (the wait service at the Dalloway Terrace was good and attentive also) and nice little touches like the chocolates at turndown. I would happily stay here again in the future.",4,2016,06,17
115,a luxury hotel very close to the British Museum,"I stayed here 3 nights recently and was pleasantly surprised by this hotel, it was such a comfortable room and excelllent service. I especially liked the fruit platter on arrival!
Als the bed was  (mattress and pillows)was great. It is not a cheap hotel, but I have often found expensive hotels in England to have small rooms, uncomfortable beds and faulty plumbing, but not so The Bloomsbury. I would stay there again gladly!",5,2016,06,15
115,Fabulous weekend break. Lovely staff.,"Recently spent two nights at the hotel to celebrate my partners birthday.  I must have mentioned that when I booked as, when we arrived, we were upgraded. Very nice room but I should mention that it was very close to the lift and there was a bit of noise on the first evening when a group of people obviously came back after an evening out.
Hotel very well situated close to the British Museum.
We went down to the in house restaurant Mrs Dalloways for lunch and had a very nice burger. I had a champagne cocktail and my partner a glass of wine plus a bottle of sparkling water and the bill came to about £55 including service charge.  I did order a glass of pink champagne which didn't come and when I saw d to cancel the order as we had finished out meal the maitre'd came over with a glass for no charge.  
We went out for the afternoon and returned to find a birthday card and cake in our room. It was delicious
Aside from that we also had breakfast in the hotel both mornings and it was good.  I wanted banana which wasn't on the buffet but it was supplied very quickly.   The hot food was very good.
Service from the concierge was excellent. From getting taxis, storing baggage to providing advice.  
We will use the hotel again",4,2016,06,15
115,Comfort and luxury in cental London,"Stayed at the Bloomsbury for a week, and found it to be very clean and quiet, with a very high standard of personal service. The staff were attentive but discreet, and the building itself is a very attractive Lutyens heritage building.  The rooms are not large, but very well appointed.

One of the great strengths of the Bloomsbury is its central location--literally a block from the British Museum, and two blocks from Tottenham Court Road tube station. Despite this, the hotel is lovely and quiet, located on a sort of side street off Tottenham. No shortage of things to do and see in the area within walking distance. There is also a cab rank across the street and a bus stop about 50m from the entrance.

Breakfast in the Dalloway Terrace is excellent, served quickly and hot. As with the rest of the hotel, the staff attention to detail and care for the guest is exemplary.",5,2016,06,14
115,Old-fashioned in the best way,"I had a very complicated booking because we were never sure how many of us there would be, or what sort of rooms we wanted. Nobody at The Bloomsbury turned a hair or made me feel at any point that I was making their life difficult, even though I was.

I was looking for a comfortable, non-standard, upmarket-but-not-costing-the-earth hotel for a special weekend in London for myself, my mother and my godmother. The hotel had to be close to the Opera House and to good shopping, and easy enough to get to the V&A the morning after. You'd think that would be impossible in central London, but the Bloomsbury was perfect.

Check-in was warm and efficient, with staff who thought ahead and worked out what would make life easiest for me when I couldn't work it out for myself. We had proper tea in the lobby while waiting for the others, and then went up to our floor - care had been taken to make sure we were as close to each other as possible. The rooms were stylish and very comfortable, with little detals that make all the difference. On Sunday I slept until 9 am. I'm usually awake at 5. The beds are very comfortable!

We were mucking about on Friday night and it was my godmother who noticed the difference between the bustle of London outside and the instant feeling of calm when you come through the door. I also got the feeling of staff doing that extra bit, all the time. You are treated with warmth and respect from the moment you arrive, and that's what makes this hotel special. I've been telling all my friends, and I'll be back!",5,2016,06,13
115,Charming!,"This has been an extremely nice stay. I enjoyed every moment i spent here. The staff was very friendly and welcoming(especially Diane and Daniela) and we loved the candles. In the evening, there is something magic in the air as soon as you step in. Unique stay with enchanted music, lots of flowers and scented candles! Bravo!",5,2016,06,13
115,Gorgeous Luxurious Hotel ,"Stayed here for three nights recently and loved every minute of it. Even though we spent most of our time out and about we managed to fit in some time to chill out in the hotel. Check in & out was hassle free & staff were so friendly, helpful & professional. On arrival the smell of flowers in the lobby and outside is beautiful and the decor is amazing with sprays of flowers here and there throughout the hotel. Rooms are spacious as is the bathroom with A/C which we needed! Each night our bed was turned down and a dressing gown, slippers and a chocolate placed on our bed. Every day water was provided along with tea/coffee and biscuits. There was a coffee maker there also which made delicious coffee. From our bedroom we could hear music from what we assumed was the outdoor bar area downstairs but it didn't bother us too much. The outdoor area is very nice but I would recommend it only for a drink. During our stay we went there to have a meal. We were seated for quite a while and nobody came to us to ask if we wanted a drink don't mind food so we got up and left. We weren't impressed with this service. The hotel is located about 5 minutes from Oxford street and other bars and restaurants. If we return I think we will visit here again, it's a beautiful hotel. ",5,2016,06,12
115,"Fantastic Hotel, Warm, Efficient & Friendly Staff, Great Location",We stayed with friends for one night. The reception we received when we entered the hotel was welcoming. The reception staff were efficient and friendly. We had a great suprise that we had been upgraded. The room was exceptional and quite. The staff in the bar and breakfast dining were attentive and helpful.  Great location with everything on your doorstep. The conseige was most helpful in giving us directions to convent garden and even produced us a map and pinpointed our route. We all had a wonderful time at the hotel and would recommend it to anyone. Thank you to everyone at the Bloomsbury. From Mr & Mrs Bullimores,5,2016,06,12
115,"Ideal location for iconic entities including British Museum,London theatres not to mention shopping in Oxford Street,Reg","The hotel is beautiful,classic designs to its furnishings,the food is excellent and the staff are outstanding.The staff dont go the extra mile,they go the extra 100 miles.You are made to feel very welcome and relaxed.The staff personalise your stay, they remember why you are there ie anniversaries family celebrations.Highly recommended,no hesitation in returning.",5,2016,06,12
115,Excellent,The hotel was very plush......staff very attentive....we had a standard room which was nice but bit on the dark side..the bathroom was a bit cramped...the dressing gown and slippers a nice luxury...but dressing gown a bit rough and itchy......the bar manager...was exceptionally  attentive..we only had a drink in the bar....but he went out of his way to get the beer my husband requested,5,2016,06,12
115,Nice hotel with quality service,"This is an upscale hotel in a central location with bar and restaurant, a small fitness center in the basement and meeting rooms. 

Service was very agreeable with painless checking and out. 

Breakfast options were a bit expensive but there are cafes across the street. 

Room was tight. 

One BIG plus was a wealth of outlets including us, European and USB. ",5,2016,06,12
115,What's changed?,"The bar has changed, new staff, new LOUD canned music, and, they got our food order wrong. What happened to Joel? Where did the calm relaxed atmosphere go?  Everything else is still top notch. My room was a deluxe queen. Comfortable, quiet, with every thing one needs including an Nespresso machine.",3,2016,06,11
115,Excellent customer service,"This is our first trip to London and the entire hotel staff were awesome. Special thanks to Daniela, Estelita and Fabio who took excellent care of us through out our stay and made us feel at home. Our many thanks to the whole staff and look forward to our next visit.",5,2016,06,09
115,"Comfortable, Great Location, Warm Welcome","Just an overnight, but a really restful, comfortable stay, right in the heart of Bloomsbury and just a stone's throw from many of the city's great locations.
Reception was efficient and welcoming, keen to offer what information I might want, but treated me like an individual, not one of a line. I had a standard room, but it was quiet and well furnished, if a little 'international' in its touch.
Public spaces in the hotel are generous and atmospheric; lots of leather and rich fabrics, evoking a feel of 'old' London. The bars and restaurants in the basement are a good place to spend the evening and refuel whether you are in a group or, like me, alone and needing to work into the evening.
Good value compared to so many of London's over-priced hotels.",4,2016,06,08
115,Excellent Location and Friendly Staff,"The Bloomsbury is very nice hotel located in the heart of London. It is within a 10-minute walk to Picadilly, Trafalgar Square, and a dozen or more west end theaters. The staff was friendly, helpful, and professional. The hotel itself is clean and up to date with lots of exposed brick, vines, and flower. My only caveat is that the Standard Room that I stayed in was very small. As I was travelling solo it was not a big issue, but two people in this room would have been difficult to manage. Otherwise, the room itself was fine with good size bath, and a comfortable bed. Overall, the hotel worked well for my needs as a tourist and was a fair value at this price point.",4,2016,06,07
115,Amazing from check in to check out!,"Myself and my friend stayed here for one night to celebrate her birthday, I simply cannot fault a single thing about this hotel or it's staff.
Location to Tottenham Court Road tube is fantastic as is its distance to oxford street (both literally around the corner).
You are greeted by the most beautiful exterior, a wall of flowers and the smell is simply divine! We arrived at around 11am simply to drop our bags off as we didn't think a room would be available, when we said this to the man on the reception he said that of course he had a room available and we could go straight up. All members of staff we encountered we're more than helpful and our room on the fourth floor was stunning with a big comfortable bed. 
As it was my friends birthday, when we got back from shopping there was a lovely card and a cake waiting for her which I thought was a lovely touch.
We also visited the bar within the hotel which made the most amazing cocktails (a big shout out to Phil the bar tender and Nadia one of the hosts who was so friendly!)
I wouldn't think twice about staying in this beautiful hotel again and can't wait for my next visit!
",5,2016,06,07
115,First Class in Every Way,"We booked a week's stay at The Bloombsury as part of a bundled air+hotel deal we found on Travelocity.  We really didn't know what to expect and were very pleasantly surprised to find a first class, well-appointed hotel with a large staff and all of the services that nice hotels used to offer but nowadays rarely do.  All of the public areas are beautifully decorated.  During our stay the front door was framed in a huge floral display in honor of the Chelsea Flower Show.  We ate twice at Mrs. Dalloway's Terrace and visited the downstairs bar multiple times.  We also ordered room service once.  All of the food and drinks throughout our stay were excellent.  

Our Travelocity deal was for a standard room which (no surprise) are the smallest rooms in the hotel.  We were initially given room 404 but a helpful staff member let us know that while all the standard rooms are the same size, there are some different configurations and since we were staying for 6 nights we might want to ask for one of the other configurations.  We spent one night in 404 and the rest of the week in 429.  Both rooms were beautifully decorated.  404 was more square-shaped with the bed directly across from the door.  The bathroom didn't have a lot of space to put things.  The desk was between the bed and the bathroom and if you were sitting at it you were kind of blocking access to the bathroom.  429's configuration was more comfortable with a little more space in the bathroom and an armchair and ottoman in the bedroom.   It was laid out more conventionally with an entrance hall with closet on the right, bathroom on left, bedroom directly ahead.  The desk was at the foot of the bed meaning there wasn't a lot of clearance between the bed and the desk but it was out of the way.  We would have been fine in 404 but 429 was better for us.  All of the front desk staff were very helpful and accommodating when we made the room change. 

The rooms have a desk with every kind of power outlet you need.  There was a coffee machine and tea kettle with different kinds of tea, coffee, hot chocolate, etc. as well as complimentary bottles of water and shortbread cookies that were replenished each day.  There are multiple lamps including convenient wall-mounted reading lamps on each side of the bed.  429 had a spacious closet and plenty of space to get the bags out of the way (very important in a small room!).  Robes and slippers were provided and the bathrooms even have a lighted make up mirror (something I wish every hotel would provide)!  The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were high-end.  The excellent housekeeping staff came in twice a day (the second time for turn-down service) so we never ran out of towels or any other supplies. 

We had a little trouble with the a/c, it seemed like it didn't cycle on and off on its own so we learned to just turn it back on when the room felt hot during the night.  We probably were doing something wrong and meant to ask someone but never remembered to.  It was no big deal turning it back on when we needed it. 

The hotel offers daily breakfast for a fee, we opted out of this because we wanted to check out neighborhood places, but we found that there wasn't a good breakfast place anywhere in the area.  And knowing how good all the food was at The Bloomsbury, it probably would have been better to just eat breakfast there each day. 

We left on an early morning flight and as we awaited our taxi to Heathrow airport, we were given little bags with breakfast for the road!   This staff here truly understand hospitality.  They made our first visit to London very special and we are most grateful.",5,2016,06,07
115,Great Location. Wonderful Staff,"If you like the British Museum, this is the place to stay.  Lobby is beautiful.  Julia (front desk manager) went above and beyond--finding us a dentist on Sunday morning.  Our room was small--but comfortable.",5,2016,06,05
115,Superb Stay,"We were only there for one weekend night, but it was a superb stay. It's a classic old style hotel, with a very relaxing atmosphere and all the staff are lovely, friendly and smiling - thanks for making our stay so nice.
Lunch on the terrace was very good and later that night we returned to the cocktail bar for a few nightcaps - the best Espresso Martini my wife has had and a top Old Fashioned for me.
Breakfast was excellent also. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,06,05
115,I want this place to myself!,"My girlfriend had booked this hotel for us as a birthday treat for me (going to see a show).  I have stayed in hotels in over 60 countries and really think this is the best yet.  Hard to compare, but the thing that stands out is the staff. From the minute that we walked through the front door until the minute we left the staff we exceptional.  Even when the particular brand of Champagne we were  sampling was exhausted the staff were onside to anticipate our needs. Friendly, helpful, never intrusive but made us feel so welcome and at home.  There was so may things I could draw attention to - it was Chelsea Flower Show week so the hotel was completely bedecked with amazing floral arrangements and stunning.  The bed was so comfortable.  Everything sparkling clean. I must highlight however again the staff in particular Ula from Poland who was there serving us in the Dalloway as we headed off to bed on Saturday night, and then when I dropped down at 0730 for a coffee and scan the papers there she was - beaming smile, remembered my name and ready to help. Every hotel needs people as professional and friendly as Ula.  The Bloomsbury is lucky that it has so many excellent and clearly well trained staff.  We always used to try different hotels in London - no more. Sorry to The Bloomsbury but we will be back and soon.  We did not want to leave at all.  Not enough star ratings above for me to compliment how exceptional this hotel is. .",5,2016,06,03
115,An Island of Calm in a Bustling City,"We chose the Bloomsbury primarily due to its proximity to the British Museum, but some of the famous sights of London (Westminster Abbey, The Eye, Big Ben, etc.) are within a 45 minute walk, as well.  
London is expensive by US standards, and the hotel was rather pricey, too.  However, the staff was friendly, efficient, and helpful.  ",4,2016,06,02
115,Perfection!,"Stayed for one night in a king suite, so the room was much larger than your standard London hotel room. Decor is lovely, very English but updated and chic rather than old and stuffy. The staff are wonderful. There was a hand-written note from the manager and a welcome fruit plate when we arrived in our room, which saved our lives. Bathroom was enormous, toiletries were high quality, bed was comfortable, central location right off Tottenham Court Road & Oxford Street but on a side street so you can choose to avoid throngs of tourists. There was a bit of a hiccup with service at The Dalloway Terrace restaurant, met some friends there for a light meal & the waitress forgot to put in part of their order and seemed to disappear. I think she was new. That aside, I was ready to book my next stay as soon as I walked out the door. Highly recommend! ",5,2016,05,31
115,Great old building,"We stayed here for four nights, and the reception and bar are great. Our room was good and comfortable except that it was too hot and stuffy. We had to put the air conditioner on all the time, and the weather was not hot. The staff were friendly and helpful and the building and its history is great.",4,2016,05,30
115,"Great aesthetic, good location, comfortable","We recently stayed for a week.  I like the location in Bloomsbury, walking to Mayfair, Soho, Covent Garden.  On a quiet street but only a block and a half from Tottenham Court Road tube.  Decor is British but not old fashioned or fussy.  Our first room was a double and a little small.  We switched to a king bed room which was adequately sized, but not generous.  They were very helpful about the switch.  Beds were comfortable.  Room had street view but quiet. Never tried the breakfast due to expense.  It is £26, but £18.50 if booked the day before.   Many cheaper options within two blocks.  Hotel caters primarily to business travelers, many meetings going on.  There is a pleasant restaurant and bar.  (Breakfast room is not the restaurant, it is in basement.)  Staff was  pretty helpful, but not as helpful as I would expect at this price.   In evening regular concierge was not on duty, and night concierges were not as knowledgeable as I would have liked.  Wifi was sometimes slow in the room.  I would give it a 5, but at this price I think 4 is better.  However London is very expensive so perhaps my expectations were unrealistic.",4,2016,05,29
115,"Nice Public Rooms, Small and Uncomfortable Hotel Room","We were very disappointed in the Bloomsbury. The public rooms of the hotel are quite lovely and the hotel has a wonderful location. However, our ""upgraded"" room was amazingly small with the bed so close to the wall that one of us had to climb over the other to get in and out of it. The room was way too hot and there was only one plug for our electronics. The lighting in the room was was too dim. The wi-fi wasn't secure and wasn't always available. I would never stay here again.",2,2016,05,29
115,Wonderful place,"To begin with what a wonderful sight - the front entrance is currently covered with a beautiful flower arrangement - the tourists passing by are all taking photos !
We thoroughly enjoyed our first stay at the Bloomsbury. The rooms and beds are very comfortable and the bathroom is well supplied with all basic necessities.  The breakfast is expensive but there is such a huge choice that it's well worth the price.and for those who don't want the Full English there are cheaper options available.  However what we really appreciated the most was the service of the entire staff from the Reception to the Housekeepers. The Concierge team were really helpful in getting us tickets.  I don't have all their names but a special thanks to Brian and Dale for their kindness and cheerful faces greeting us at the door. Also thanks to Ken, the maintenance man who fixed a little problem in the bathroom in a giffy. We also had a memorable moment chatting with 2 of the bar staff in French. So keep up the good work - you don't get this standard in every hotel.  We'll be back when we can.",5,2016,05,29
115,A choice to London: why not😉,"At first, I thought I would never find a way to the hotel due to London traffic and constructions. But that's just a first impression if you are stranger. On the contrary, the location is good: near-by tube station, Oxford street right at the corner, china town to get on foot, regent street and  etc. etc etc)))) as for the hotel: all is at the best level possible except breakfast probably. But that's my opinion. I think it's just too scarce as for the choice you have even a-la carte. I would prefer more fruits and deserts, more cheese and sausage variety. Rooms: spacey, comfortable, lovely ""sleep well"" service, amazing bathroom kits. And thanks for the staff for organizing safe and early transfer to the airport.",4,2016,05,29
115,Best place to stay in London,"My family and I stayed in this hotel for 3 days for our European vacation, I love that it was centrally located, with very nice room, and bathrooms, the bed sheet, comforter and pillow made me sleep like a baby, our stay came with a complimentary breakfast, that helps for a family of four , and mind you, the breakfast spread which is a Buffett has a very good selection, The breakfast staff was phenomenal, special shout out to Ms Estelita Bueno, she was the one that greeted us when we enter the breakfast venue and lead us to our table , I tell you what the moment we sat, we were treated like royalty which nowadays is a rarity in the food service industry, since we are not familiar with the English breakfast setting Estelita, took time in explaining it to us, Estelita and Maria, which was working in tandem that day made it easier for us, I started with coffee , fresh fruits , I loved the ripeness of the fresh pineapple and papaya, wow it's been ages since I have eaten one, fresh bake pastries and bread, I can't stop coming back for seconds for their organic smoke salmon and their poach chicken, and if that was not enough, you can also order from the menu for a made to order item, on all 3 days my wife ordered French toast and bacon and  , my daughter pancakes and me and my son the organic smoke salmon omelette serve on a toast, all of these plus what I already got from the buffet gosh makes my mouth watering, oh a pleasant surprise also as Chef Paul O'Brien stopped by at our table to check with us as how the food were, and took time to chat for a little bit, how cool was that, I highly recommend this place to stay when you are in London, by the way, Estelita recommended also an afternoon tea at the hotel lobby, it was a true English experience and I'm glad we went and did it, it was superb, my family and I enjoyed it a lot especially my 2 kids as they were very impressed 
",5,2016,05,28
115,Wonderful stay,"This hotel is well located a block from the Tottenham Road Tube station.
Our check-in was not so smooth to begin with. Person who checked us in had attitude and the first room we were shown had a bathroom sink with no vanity or place to put ones brush, toothbrush etc.
We moved to a much nicer room with more adequate bathroom and were very happy.
Rooms are reasonable size especially considering this is London! Modern and freshly updated.Also very quiet
Staff were generally helpful but there seemed to be a lack of knowledge about meal plans and charges for breakfast.
We were told breakfast was 26  pounds per person but reduced to 18 pounds if you reserved a day before. We were then told on the second day of our stay that breakfast was included only to be told again that it was not. Eventually a meeting with management resulted in breakfast being included. The staff need to get their act together!!!
Overall however, we enjoyed our stay because of the good accommodation, the location and the general feel of the hotel. It would have been perfect if not for the minor irritations.
Probably would stay here again. Have also stayed at The Sofitel and The Landmark which were outstanding but more pricey.",5,2016,05,28
115,"Lovely terrace, stressful planning","First, I will qualify this review by saying that I originally posted comments which were perhaps too harsh and didn't mention the positives. The hotel then contacted me to apologise, better understand the problems and invite us back. This made me review my review and so I am posting again with hopefully a more balanced picture of our experience.

We organised an event in the library here, with a meal on the terrace first. They both made a lovely venue and the staff on the day were very friendly and helpful. We had a baby with us and they even gave him a small teddy! We also spoke with the concierge and F&B sales manager, who were both excellent.

However, the run up to the event was made much more difficult by the events planning team - misunderstandings due to them not reading our emails, which led to last minute price increases. Also constantly changing arrangements which was quite frustrating. On the day, there were several food mistakes, mostly unrectified, and we were overcharged for drinks which was also not rectified. We mentioned these issues to the events team afterwards but nothing was done about it.

The terrace is a really lovely space for a meal with helpful staff, but I find it difficult to recommend the hotel as an event venue - although I am sure that we were unlucky and, having spoken to them since my first review, that they will address the problems we had.",3,2016,05,28
115,Bloomsbury club,"Visited the Bloomsbury Club last night sheet taking a look at the hotels gorgeous flowers in aid of Chelsea. The bar is really beautiful, drinks a really good selection and very good. We were served by Eljesa, who was lovely and attentive.",5,2016,05,28
115,Excellent Business Dinner,"I organised a business dinner here for 23 people and was a little worried that the restaurant was on the lover level however I was very impressed by the setting. Furthermore the food was excellent, prioritising local produce, and very good value for money as we had a tight budget to respect. The staff were extremely professional and very accommodating even though some of our group arrived late due to flight delays. Only point of improvement ... the crème brulée was a bit too runny ... but I would definitely go back and hopefully to also stay in the hotel. Thank you very much.",5,2016,05,27
115,Great service and everything you need,"We had a king room facing the street on 4th floor which was one upgrade from standard. The room was quiet. It was small but plenty of room for suitcases and clothing in wardrobes. We had an arm chair with ottoman and a desk with chair. A minibar was nice. The bath was good sized for  London hotel. The lighting and the flat screen TV were excellent. The room had AC that you could control easily but I noticed that it had a timer so that the ac did shut off after a certain number of hours. The elevator was efficient and moderate sized but there were a couple of steps to our room.There are a lot of steps to get into the hotel, not sure about other accessibility. The restaurant was good.  The service by every staff member we encountered was outstanding. We reserved 6 months ahead of time directly from the hotel and got an excellent deal.",5,2016,05,25
115,Lovely Hotel,"Fabulous hotel in a great location, two minutes from Tottenham Court Road and five minutes walk to Drury Lane, Strand etc for Theatre and Oxford Street for shopping. Wonderful welcome from lovely staff, gave us warm flannel to refresh our hands after travel, nice touch. I asked for low floor, got exactly what I asked for. 
Every member of staff at this hotel is friendly, helpful and attentive, I felt special. The room was great, bed is very firm, pillows are a matter of personal taste, the room had everything you need, hairdryer, toiletries etc, tea/coffe, water and delicious biscuits. The only thing you could add to make it fantastic is a make up mirror, the lighting is low and I couldn't,t see to put make up on, so a magnified or light up mirror would have been a great addition. 
We have stayed in London quite a lot and I wanted a hotel with an outdoor terrace to enjoy drinks and a smoke (yes I know, tut tut, dirty smoker, shoot me now!) it was great at night you wouldn't believe you were in the middle of London, surrounded by lovely plants sat on a lovely terrace with some piped music, fantastic! What a difference to other London hotels, we wanted to have drinks on the terrace the next day before going home, we certainly didn't need lunch after such a spectacular breakfast, but we noticed that there was people eating there instead of on the Dallaway Terrace and I would not smoke next to people eating, even though the ash trays were on the tables, so unfortunately, we had to go elsewhere for our drinks, the Crown Pub about five minutes walk away, which was quite nice by the way. we had evening meal over the road at Scoff & Banter which apparently is owned by the hotel, we didn't realise until after when the waitress asked if we would like our meals billed to our room and we looked a bit puzzled, the food was very nice and the service was very good.
Anyway, if you want a luxury hotel, at reasonable cost, in a super location, with delicious, hot and plentiful breakfast, and fantastic bar and terrace facilities, with remarkable staff, then look no further, this is the hotel for you, unless anything changes, I will definitely not be looking to stay anywhere else whenever I am in London.",5,2016,05,25
115,Perfect little slice of England centrally located in Bloomsbury,"Passing, we wondered what the Mrs Dalloway terrace might be, and whether suitable for a quick brunch. Well, charmingly full of English country garden flowers in pots and urns, with a very nicely put together weatherproof terrace with heaters and rugs, in case of chills. Nice menu, complete with juices, at reasonable central London prices. Very close to the British museum and the wonderful art material shop, Cornellison, and also close to Tottenham Court Rd underground. We were due somewhere else so couldn't linger but, together with the excellent restrooms and very efficient staff there are good reasons to go back. PS Mrs Dalloway was the central character in Virginia Woolf's novel of the same name, a member of the Bloomsbury Group!",4,2016,05,25
115,Lovely stay at the Bloomsbury.,"Had a nice stay in a classic hotel that honors its tradition as a center for poetry, theater and art. The entry door was finely adorned with a floral display that no one who passed could not pull out their cell phone and record as it was so impressively compiled. Comfortable rooms with large bath and shower.  Had friends for lunch in the garden restaurant which is very comfortable  and appealing reprise from the bustle of its central location. The bar was cozy with live jazz sax playing to canned music with attentive staff, one waitstaff stands out with her ever present smile and charming behavior, Iljsia, (spelling). The staff are well trained and energetic, all finely dressed in appropriate attire as you would expect from a lodging of this quality. Often two doormen to greet you. The concierge were helpful and went out of their way to make sure they were available to help with bus, train, taxi and general information. Two names stand out in this regard, Dale was dedicated to excelling in his job, as well as Naikasl (spelling) from Sri Lanka who was expert in his assistance. The manager was also available greeted you with a personalized card and sweets tray upon your arrival. A few problems, the shower overflowed onto the bath floor and had to pull the drain out to get proper drainage. Another downside for a hotel of this rating is the air conditioning system which shuts off at a periodic intervals. Something you will often see a economy hotels. You have to get up in the middle of the night and turn it on again a few times during the night.",4,2016,05,24
115,Excellent hotel,"This hotel met with our expectations and the food,drink, service was exceptional. We had a really good welcome from the staff and very helpful if we required somebody to take our bags to our rooms. The area in the lobby was particaluarly nice as we used this as a meeting area as there was 8 of us. The bar Dalloway Terrace downstairs was really comfortable and the ambience and music was just right for us. Breakfast is a bit pricey so we did go out for breakfast across the road at VQ Bloomsbury and it was brilliant.",5,2016,05,24
115,Brilliant service,"Stayed overnight.My room was quite small but very well appointed and in immaculate condition.
The location is excellent for tourism,the British Museum is only a short walk away,but I thought it rather expensive.(I suppose I'm out of touch with London prices.)
The service was excellent and the staff helpful but not pushy.
I'd certainly go again.",4,2016,05,22
115,Bloomsbury hotel london,We stayed here last week the room was beautiful and the service was great too we have stayed here before about 5 years ago and its even better now we had our bed made and towels changed and we had only been there a few hours would definitely recommend,5,2016,05,21
115,Lovely stay,"Stayed here for 5 nights in May for work and really enjoyed my stay. Rooms are on the small side but this wasn't a problem for me as I was staying on my own. Slept really well every single night, I'm normally a very light sleeper but wasn't disturbed by noise and the pillows were so comfy it inspired me to replace my own after a night back in my own bed! Some nice touches such as butlers chocolates left during turndown. Only slightly disappointing aspects were a very small gym down in the basement which felt very isolated, there wasn't another sole on that level of the hotel when I went to use it so decided not to stay and I tried the restaurant on one evening but it wasn't the best meal of my stay. Overall though, lovely hotel in a good location and I'm sure I'll return.",5,2016,05,21
115,A lovely boutique hotel in a great location,"When I return to London I will also return to The Bloomsbury. The hotel is lovely, the service was terrific and polite. I paid about $275 per night - an amazing rate via Tablet. 

My room (517) was wonderful. The room was up to date and stylish. I'm a Realtor and an interior designer, so a nicely designed room is important. The bathroom had a tub, which came in handy for my aching calves later in the week. The room is a standard size for any cosmopolitan city. Some may feel that it's small. Compared to hotels in Paris and New York, it's just fine!  

You don't need to bring an adapter for your chargers, etc. There's a nice line of plugs that take current and plugs from everywhere. Free WIFI! I never turned on the TV. The hair dryer was a real hair dryer - not a weak thing attached to the bathroom wall. 

I didn't order the breakfast. There was a Nespresso machine in the room, and that's all I need in the morning. They also have a tea kettle and tea, etc... Basically, they've thought of everything.

I had dinner and tea at The Dalloway - their al-fresco restaurant. Delicious! Read my separate review of the restaurant.

The Bloomsbury is in a great location. It's a couple of short blocks away from the Tottenham Court Rd tube station. The British Museum is right down the street. I walked to the National Portrait Gallery and over to Soho for dinner. Mostly, I was out and about and used the tube to go everywhere. There's a pharmacy and a Sainsbury's right nearby so you can stock up on bottles of water, a bottle of wine, and snacks for your room.

I'd like to end by saying that the staff was really wonderful. Everyone was smiling, gracious and helpful.",5,2016,05,21
115,Luxury stay,"I stayed here as part of a work trip to London and all i can say is that I wish we had more time to enjoy the hotel.

The smell throughout was divine and the hotel had a proper boutique feel to it.

The rooms were of a decent size, and decorated very tastefully.

The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was modern and very clean.

We visited the bar in the evening once we got back from our event and although it was fairly pricey (over £10 for a single vodka and coke!!) it had a nice atmosphere.",5,2016,05,20
115,"Great location, wonderful staff","Located near the British Museum in the heart of Bloomsbury/Fitzrovia and close to underground and bus lines going every which way, this medium size hotel felt very much like home during a week-long vacation stay. The rooms are modern, well insulated from street noises and comfortable. The breakfast is excellent and the staff is cheerful and very helpful. My wife and I couldn't have been happier.",5,2016,05,18
115,Perfect!,"Stayed for 5 days. Location was excellent... close to the Tube and great restaurants, but away from the hubbub and traffic. A block from the British Museum! The room was clean, and well appointed. Loved the updated electrical plugs...no need for any converter, but convenient for the additional options. Staff was lovely and friendly. Didn't actually try breakfast there, but did have a brunch and it was wonderful. Hung out at the bar one night before a show, food and drinks were great... the bartenders took great pride and put in significant effort to craft excellent cocktails.",5,2016,05,17
115,Wonderful stay,"Stayed for 2 nights as a weekend treat with friends, hotel atmosphere was lovely and our room was so clean, comfortable and relaxing. The concierge Brian was most helpful in organizing tickets for sightseeing around London during our stay. Great location and would definitely recommend to other friends and family and would love to return ourselves.",5,2016,05,16
115,Another Surperb Visit,This was my 4th or 5th stay & the Bloomsbury continues to delight. Always a warm welcome and check in smooth. The Rooms appears to have been updated and feel more contemporary. Good size for London & super quiet for the jet lagged traveler. Great breakfast to start your day & a not too unreasonable price. They have opened a new terrace bar which I didnt have time to enjoy but look delight especially in the fine weather. Would return for another stay.,5,2016,05,15
115,London mini break in the heart of London.,"As someone who does not know their way around London, finding The Bloomsbury could not have been easier, just a few minutes walk from Tottenham Court tube station. From the minute we arrived the staff were extremely polite and very helpful. The Deluxe room we had was spacious and laid out very well. Room service were very prompt and helpful, again being very polite. Nothing was too much trouble. Location for both shopping and nightlife could not have been better! Would thoroughly recommend a visit down to see Phil in the bar, a very entertaining and talented barman. We would definitely stay there again.",5,2016,05,15
115,Excellent over night stay,"Stayed for one night as part of a theatre weekend package , the hotel was very impressive  and afforded the comfort one would expect from a hotel of this standing, the staff were very attentive without being overbearing, the room very comfortable and whilst not overly large more than enough space for our one night stay, the room was very quiet and again had all the facilities one would expect , mini bar, tea and coffee , wi-fi, hairdryer , air con and complementary toiletries.  We dined in the evening at the Dalloway Terrace  restaurant adjoining the hotel which was excellent , we had a pre meal drink in the bar downstairs and whilst the decor and atmosphere was pleasant , I am not a fan of Gregory Porter and his music which was blasting out , so we went upstairs to the restaurant at the earliest opportunity . Breakfast the next day was again very good and checkout was very efficient . Well done all round albeit less Gregory Porter next time please 😉",5,2016,05,15
115,Great stay.  Excellent choice.,"We stayed for 5 nights and was very pleased.  Great location, friendly and helpful staff, and good value. The terrace and lower level bars are quite nice for a relaxing drink. Close to British Museum and theaters.   Easy public transportation close by.  Quiet and restful at night. 
Would highly recommend.
",4,2016,05,15
115,Overnight Escape,"I had high expectations of the Bloomsbury and it didn't disappoint. 
Met from our taxi and shown straight to reception in a friendly, efficient, but very relaxed manor. 
Offered hot towels to freshen up was a nice touch. Nothing was too much trouble. Lunch was quickly arranged on the new terrace from the desk and then up to our room. Amazing space. Modern, spacious and with all the trimmings that you expect. The test of any hotel - a huge comfortable bed with quality linen. Great bathroom and good stocked mini bar and proper coffee. 

The new terrace is what brought us to The Bloomsbury and it instantly delivered. Lunch was served in a light and airy space which you quickly forget is in Central London. Contemporary design, amazing menu with well thought out drinks menu to compliment. The Crab is an absolute must! 
What tops it off is the staff. This crew look proud of the Hotels new look and they want to show it off. They do this very well. 

The new look is also evident in the Bloomsbury Club Bar. A great way to start (or end) the evening with a drink and some amazing live Jazz. Fabulous decor and the attention to detail is again very evident. 

Breakfast was unfussy and very well prepared. A relaxed environment and great staff are again what makes this setting work. 

In short - highly recommended, great new look, great rooms, great staff and a real game changer from this popular and progressive Hotel Group. I would happily take drinks, lunch or dinner here aside of the accommodation being that it is 2 minutes from the tube. 
Very happy.",5,2016,05,15
115,The best!,"This is an outstanding hotel. It sits in the luxury category but it does 'posh' so well! I could not fault any aspect of this wonderful hotel and consider it to be excellent value at the top end of the scale. Highly recommended. Service, comfort and attention to detail were fantastic.",5,2016,05,15
115,Great hotel in a great location,"We stayed for one night and had a lovely time, the food was amazing, the terrace was a undiscovered delight and room was really comfortable and clean. Great cocktails too, and lots of areas to enjoy within the hotel itself. Covent Garden is literally moments away. Would recommend to anyone as a holiday location, or even as an escape to a night in town.",5,2016,05,14
115,Loved this little gem!,"I loved this hotel. Was here for 2 days and it was a great place to stay right in the heart of London. You can walk to the theatre district, to Covent Garden, Chinatown, the museum of natural history.  The rooms are immaculate, the service terrific and they have an excellent breakfast and tea.   I would stay here again.

Note; Rooms are smaller so if you are a family of 4 be sure to ask for a room for 4.",4,2016,05,13
115,I couldn't imagine a better place to stay in London,"The Bloomsbury has many options: a cozy lobby for afternoon tea and drinks; a heated outdoor ""porch""; a dark and cozy bar and restaurant.  Our room was small, but comfortably designed with a decent sized bathroom.  The bed and linens were lovely.  The concierges that we dealt with knew their stuff, including the right end of the train to get on for an efficient trip to the airport.  They had a clear neighborhood map and gave us a nice walking route that even our guide book didn't have. The food and wine were more than good. The location was within walking distance to the river, theaters, parks, book stores and restaurants.  Even the stairway to walk up/down to our room was wide, open and quite grand. The ultimate comparison: it's as good, if not a better choice, than our favorite hotel in Manhattan.",5,2016,05,12
115,Lovely hotel,"I visited the Bloomsbury hotel with my 7 year old son for 3 nights for a weekend in beginning of May. Had a wonderful stay. Great location (walking distance to a lot of attractions, easy access to tube etc.), lovely hotel and staff, and nice and comfortable rooms. We felt very welcome. The Dalloway terrace was a lovely oasis for a drink in the afternoon - great ambiance, nice staff - loved it. Will definitely stay again.",5,2016,05,12
115,"Slow response, sloppy","Dim lighting. Requested fixing. Was fixed. Should not have to complain, it was an obvious problem.

Broken desk lamp. Complained twice. Never fixed. 

TV channels pixelated, freezing. Did not report problem.  

Breakfast: waiters forgot what the order was, brought wrong item. Did not complain or report problem. 

Room upgrade promised never happened.

The hotel offers room coffee - but forgets to resupply the cartridges.  

Staff response is slow. Some standards should be upheld without the need of reporting. After all, the room is cleaned daily. A broken desk lamp, and dim lighting are obvious problems. Refreshing the coffee supply (if the hotel offers it) should be part of the routine.... ",4,2016,05,11
115,A second home !,"Our second time at the Bloomsbury.
Thumbs up for all the team ! our stay was a pure delight.
The hotel is soo confortable and cosy, the team is nice and caring. Our boys got a real treat, welcome drawings on the miror of their room, delicious home-made cookies next day left on the desk... and the list is long !
The Bloomsbury is surely our home in London ;-)
A special thanks to Julia & Moritz,

Nicolas, Maria & their gang",5,2016,05,11
115,Great Experience,"Highly recommended hotel with great rooms, awesome decoration and an almost perfect location. The hotel staff is very friendly and the concierge Andre helped us to make our days in London easier and happier.",5,2016,05,11
115,Wonderful!,"Beautiful hotel, gorgeous rooms. Clean and very comfortable. Staff are lovely and could not do enough for us. Food delicious. Cannot speak highly enough of this establishment. Was a pleasure to stay there during our theatre break. Will definitely return!",5,2016,05,10
115,I love this place,"It's the perfect hotel for me. Nice and wide rooms, attentive staff, excellent location, wi-fi in all areas, reasonably priced. The restaurante and the bar in the new patio provide tasty food. I always stay here when I am travelling to London for business (often!)",5,2016,05,10
115,A wonderful surprise. A quiet gem.,"My friend and I recently spent a long layover in London at this comfortable, chic, literary  hotel. The beautifully appointed rooms were spacious, the lobby, terrace bar and restaraunts were lovely an exceptionally staffed. I was constantly and happily surprised by the small details and luxuries. It was enough to rejuvenate this weary traveler.",5,2016,05,10
115,Poor service and substandard food - afternoon tea,"We booked the table in advance for a Saturday and were then told by the hotel that the booking time needed to be moved by an hour. We were happy with this.

On arrival the waitress appeared confused when we explained the name the booking was under. She then found the booking and showed us to our table which was in the lobby area of the hotel (not on the terrace). We then waited for 15 minutes before we saw any staff member again. This was disappointing and things didn't get better after this. 

We were advised that there was no menu available but instead the male staff member reeled off a list of the tea from memory and asked us to pick. Again this was disappointing as we were pressured into remembering the different teas he had just listed then he stood there waiting for our answers. It was difficult to hear him as the piano in the background was so loud. He also made it clear to us that he was annoyed with the volume of the piano. 

The free flowing champagne wasn't very free flowing at all. It was difficult to get the attention of any member of staff and it appeared quite a few customers were sitting at their tables with empty glasses. We constantly had to try to get the attention of staff members to refill the glasses.

We asked three different members of staff for a glass of water and only after the fourth attempt after asking was this brought to the table. The tea arrived quickly however it was 45 minutes before the food arrived. As there was no menu it wasn't clear what some of the sweet items were. The staff did not take the time to explain this either which other good afternoon tea places do. As the tea arrived long before the food, the tea started to get cold.

The food was disappointing. It looked and tasted like it had been left out for a while. We did notice the plates of food sitting on the side counter for 15 minutes before they were brought to our table. The bread for the sandwiches was dry which indicated they had been left out for a long time.

We asked for the bill and this arrived quite quickly which was surprising. The bill looked confusing as the drinks and food were charged for separately even though we purchased packages. The waiter did explain that it looked confusing and provided a written breakdown on the back of the receipt. We were still working out who needed to pay what but he was back within 30 seconds with the card machine. We were contemplating whether we should pay the service charge for the poor service provided. The waiter mentioned the service charge numerous times that in the end we just paid it. In hindsight we probably should have asked to have this taken off the bill. 

While we were paying the same staff member mentioned that we booked our afternoon tea at a very busy time. He also explained that next time it would be better for us to come on a weekday. Firstly this was our first afternoon tea at the Bloomsbury so we wouldn't have known that we had booked at a busy time. Secondly it was the hotel which changed our booking time. Thirdly, we work on weekdays and that is why we booked a Saturday. Fourthly, it's strange how he presumed that we would want to come back to the Bloomsbury for afternoon tea.

There appeared to be a shortage of staff during the time we were there. This led to staff not being very visible and when they were, they were difficult to get hold of. Don't offer free flowing champagne if you don't have enough staff to serve this! Don't offer a afternoon tea experience if customers constantly have to ask for service!

I'm not sure that the Bloomsbury fully appreciates that an afternoon tea experience isn't just about the food but the whole package including service. The staff could benefit from customer service training. 

There are so many great places for afternoon tea in London and the Bloomsbury isn't one of them. Avoid this place to avoid disappointment. ",2,2016,05,07
115,OUR HONEYMOON,"I can not say enough good things about this hotel and their staff at all levels. From the check-in to our last day they were great. The rooms are very clean and nicely decorated, of course typical of overseas hotels unless you upgrade to a higher category your room will not be the size of hotel rooms in the USA. We did upgrade 2 levels to the deluxe room, it was a nice size with plenty of room to move around, that's not to say the standard is bad as 2 of our friends stayed in the standard and it was comfortable, your not spending your visit in the room so spend the money on your other interests. The staff was always welcoming, friendly and very helpful with any request you might have. The location was fantastic right in the theater district and the famous Oxford street for shopping just 2-3 blocks away, British Museum just up our street. You must get the full breakfast included in your bookings it was all you can imagine and more, you will not leave hungry, it included both buffet and hot food to order. Our group ended every nite downstairs in the BAR where we enjoyed drinks and food, again the Staff in the bar could not have been any better. The hotel is next to Tottenham tube station. Again we had a grand ole time at the hotel.",5,2016,05,07
115,Couldn't be better,"I stayed for 1 night in the hotel and it couldn't be better. It is a warm, welcoming and personal environment. Traditional but beautiful design. Fully equipped and comfortable rooms. The Bloomsbury Club cocktail bar with live jazz music and the Dalloway Terrace are worth to try. I had a great experience and want to thank Alladin and Dionne for the service. Professional but personal. If I would return to London, I will come back.",5,2016,05,07
115,Lovely afternoon tea with flowing champers - fab!,Girly afternoon tea to see off a colleague on maternity leave. Great service from an attentive waiter. Food was delicious and they replenished the sandwiches for us when they saw how we had wolfed them down. Woudl go again in a heartbeat. THANK YOU.,5,2016,05,06
115,Business drinks and canapes,"I didn't stay at the hotel so can't comment on that but we did use the terrace bar for drinks and canapés for a work event.

The staff were really friendly and approachable providing great service.

The red wine and canapés were delicious.

I would certainly hire this place myself should I need to do an event in a central London location.",4,2016,05,06
115,Birthday visit for drinks and dinner.,"Great attentive service. Led by Aladdin. Realized it was my birthday and responded with a glass of champagne and after diner a personalized cake. Later after our show, great cocktails in the basement bar. Thank you. Well done to all.",5,2016,05,04
115,beautiful hotel in London city center,"stayed there with my son when I was on a business. the hotel in terms of facilities and services was great. The staff was very friendly. The only problem is that rooms were small. But in such location, if you are alone and on short trip, this would be among the best",4,2016,05,03
115,The perfect break!,"My husband and I were looking for a hotel in London near Covent Garden for a weekend break. The Bloomsbury had been recommended and we felt the room rates were good. Booked direct with the hotel who were very helpful. On every level we were happy with our choice. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.  Location was perfect, able to walk easily to Covent Garden and areas around there. We were on the 2nd floor and pleased with the quietness of the room, which was also a good size and all very clean. The bed was comfortable and all facilities we needed on hand - free wifi , tea and coffee (Nespresso)  making facilities to name a few. Enjoyed an after-theatre night cap and snack in the partially covered and heated bar area - very cosy and the perfect way to round off the evening! Definitely planning to stay here again when we next have the chance to stay overnight in London.  ",5,2016,05,03
115,Fantastic ,This is a beautiful hotel that deserves 5 stars. The new terrace is an amazing oasis built to perfection. Service is A-rated. A great spot for drinks. The rooms are really well appointed. Very clean and quiet. Will defiantly be back. Bar looks amazing but didn't get to use it. Reception is friendly. ,5,2016,05,02
115,Amazing hotel,"The hotel is beautiful and is in a great location. The staff are wonderful where nothing was too much for them. The rooms are spacious, with a big comfy bed and lovely bathroom! Would definitely recommend and would happily stay again if in London",5,2016,05,02
115,"Charming, quiet, low key refined in midst of tourist central","Charming hotel, superbly comfortable beds, well appointed deluxe room, super attentive staff, quiet, relaxed, the basement barman joel is an entertainer in his own right. Hotel dining was quite adequate (actually lamb and the filet were above average towards excellent). Very welcoming, tasteful lobby, not stodgy and not  urbanista hipper than thou. A relaxed upscale welcome change from chain hotels. If you value quiet, relaxed air, comfort and the attentions of a proper barman, check out / into the Bloomsbury. ",5,2016,05,02
115,Classy and welcoming,"we had a one night stay for shopping and museums.  Very friendly staff, good sleep, great bathrobes.  We had an unexpected upgrade.   The reception and concierge staff were all very attentive and friendly.",5,2016,05,01
115,Our visit,"Nice hotel and great location. Close to tube station and many shops and cafes. Rooms abit small and queen bed was abit tight but still a nice experience. British museum right down the street and tube station a 3 minute walk.

115,Landseer Restaurant,"We had a superb meal in this restaurant, excellent service, superb food and good value... highly recommended, would definitely eat here again!!.. a perfect restaurant for dinner before a show at The Dominion Theatre which is less than 5 minutes walk away..",5,2016,04,28
115,Idyllic hotel in central London,"What a grand building. Located in central London, very close to British Museum, but feels rather tucked away from the hustle and bustle.

Room is rather small, with very small window, but this is London, and a room this size is somewhat acceptable for the price. 

Love the afternoon tea at the lobby, great atmosphere. Also tried the restaurant, did not disappoint. 

Overall, a great base for 5 days to explore London, and convenient for going out as well (west end and Soho).",4,2016,04,27
115,London 2016 trip,"Dale, one of the concierges, was great and very helpful with all of our crazy American tourist questions. All of the staff was nice and obliging. The breakfast was fantastic. The room was comfy and nice. Great location to one of the main Tube stations (Tottenham Court Rd). Couldn't ask for a better place. We will definitely choose them again!!!!!",5,2016,04,26
115,Needs staff appraisal....,"Well what a disappointment the landseer bar is. A pretty girl behind the bar busy doing anything other than scanning her customers for orders, and a wandering waiter busy disappearing. We're trying to order more cocktails and some food - they are trying to ignore anything like work. 
All fur coat and no knickers in this establishment.
Shame - a great idea executed very poorly.",2,2016,04,26
115,Perfect stay,"Room was very cosy with turndown service in the evening. Very comfortable bed. Nespresso coffee machine in the room and quality bath robes are few examples of the special perks. Free WiFi with excellent connection. Not far away from British Museum, shops and tube station. Staff were attentive and friendly. ",5,2016,04,25
115,Honeymoon! ,"We stayed for a couple of nights at The Bloomsbury back in January for a short break away after our Wedding but before our honeymoon, so a kinda 'pre' honeymoon! We had a fabulous stay! We were asked on arrival the reason for our stay, and when they knew we were newly married they really went to town! On returning from our afternoon exploring London, we found rose petals all over our room, 'I love you' on the bed! A complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolates, and a card! Staff very helpful, food was lovely, but quite pricey for breakfast especially, we ended up finding a small Italian cafe round the corner on the second day, serving just as good breakfast for around a fiver! But never the less, had a most enjoyable time here and would definitely return nxt time we visit London! :-)",5,2016,04,25
115,Classic elegance,"Stayed here for 2 nights for our daughter's 18th birthday. Everything about the Bloomsbury is delightful in a very understated manner. The room was fabulous; the decor, bed linen and even toiletries in the bathroom. My daughter and I had a wonderful stay and we would definitely return.",5,2016,04,25
115,Just Perfect,"Everything about this hotel is just perfect. Location, décor, staff, food, rooms.  The service was excellent and nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff.  From check in to check out it was just a lovely experience.  We arrived at 11am in the morning, so we only expected to leave our luggage as we had matinee tickets for The Globe, but we were checked straight in which was a wonderful bonus.
The location is fab, a quiet back street but right near the British Museum and really central for getting around London.
The reception/lounge area as you enter is so welcoming and relaxing, with the most beautiful smelling candles burning, which just adds to the ambiance and makes it feel quite serene. 
In the evening on our return we ate on the enchanting Dalloway Terrace where the food was delicious and the staff were absolutely brilliant, nothing was too much trouble.  There are overhead heaters and even blankets on the back of each chair which is a lovely touch, though they weren't needed even on such a chilly night.
We had a couple of drinks downstairs in the club bar before retiring for bed, where we enjoyed some fab tunes from the live sax player, and again the staff were just so attentive and welcoming. We loved it.  In fact we loved everything about this hotel and we were just sorry we could only stay for 1 night.
I will most certainly recommend this hotel to all my family and friends and we're already looking forward to our next visit.",5,2016,04,25
115,All the quality none of the snobbery !!,"Very smart, very friendly , very good food, very good room!
What more need to be said?
Very very very very Good
Go and see for your self it's very smart 
Great full English breakfast
Location is ideal for most of the tourist things
Enjoy I'm sure you will!

",5,2016,04,24
115,Still our favourite hotel in London,"Perfect location, slap bang in the very heart of the West End but with no noise. Staff make you feel like you are at home and the decor is just stunning.Really great value for money considering its location and facilties.We can't recommend this enough",5,2016,04,24
115,Certainly not 5 * but a decent 4,"We chose The Bloomsbury due to its location to the theatre district as it we were seeing a show in the evening. 
After a long wait on reception as the only staff member was on the phone, (and there didn't appear to be anyone else working on a busy Saturday afternoon) we were shown to our room. My partner called back reception instantly as he had booked a room with a separate shower, not one in the bath, a small detail,but one we had highlighted we wanted and had paid for. They had given us a much smaller room without what we wanted. Reception quickly reacted and gave us another room. 
We were pleased with the new room as it was lovely, everything you would require in it. It felt really spacious.
The restaurant on the ground floor was fully booked, so we checked out the Dalloway Terrace. It was slightly too early to eat, so we were just going to have a drink but the outside heaters were on so strong we felt we were being cooked! We headed inside where it was Afternoon Tea time, and once again, one member of staff was trying to cover the whole bar area on his own. This sort of hotel should never appear under-staffed!
We later ate at the Dalloway Terrace where the stunning setting of fairy lights and climbing flowers really created a 'holiday' feel.  We asked for a wine from the menu which we thought the waiter understood which one we meant.  It wasn't until after looking at the bill that we realised that the waiter had in fact selected he most expensive one of £110 - I thought it tasted delicious but we wouldn't of had that one had he of just thought to check we meant the same one!
The food certainly takes second place to the setting but it is still delicious. Though £25 for the scallops for main course?! Yes they were lovely and fat but just came with a green salad, didn't really feel worth the money. 
We had an an enjoyable evening and returned to use their room service for some midnight snacks - fantastic quick service!
Overall, we liked The Bloomsbury but it didn't really provide the 5* experience we were expecting. It needs more staff and more attention to detail.",3,2016,04,24
115,High tea with champagne,"Had a wonderful relaxing afternoon tea with great friendly service quality champagne with our tea for 2 yummy sandwiches good scones and amazing cheese cake in the beautiful hotel lobby which has both history and style 
It was not rushed and we would certainly come back
",5,2016,04,24
115,First class in every respect,"My wife and I stayed for two nights in a suite which was terrific, very spacious with a large comfortable KIng size bed, the bathroom was huge and had both a free-standing bath and separate walk-in shower with underfloor heating. The cocktail bar was cosy and fun and the food for dinner was great. The hotel was first rate in every area but special mention has to go to ALL the staff, from the minute we arrived we were treated like long lost friends and made to feel like we were the only guests there. We can not recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2016,04,23
115,Creme de la creme,"We went there for dinner in the Dalloway Terace; absolutely amazing!!! Andrei and Julia looked very well after us. Downstairs in the bar we had best cocktails ever, with Joel and Matthew making our night special. Can't wait to come back again! ",5,2016,04,22
115,"English Charm, Great Location, Top Service","I rarely write but this place deserves a review! Loved this place. It took me a long time of searching - so many hotels in London, all pricey. This one had a price I thought in line with the Radisson Blu types but sooo much more attractive. Totally elegant and cosy lobby.It's nice to just sit in there and hook up the laptop (if you are on business). GREAT Wifi - easy to connect and you don't have to login repeatedly like at some hotels... it just remembers you. Room was a decent size for London and this whole place is old charm with modern comfort. And it was super quiet in the room at night. If you are one where surroundings are important to you, this is your place. It also is so close to Oxford and great shopping. Will stay again.",5,2016,04,22
115,A gem of a hotel,"I stayed here for two nights earlier this month. We arrived late (just before midnight) but we were greeted by extremely friendly and efficient staff.
The breakfast which we had out on the terrace was wonderful. A lovely place to sit and enjoy the delicious food. The service here was splendid.
The room was spacious and quiet. The coffee machine was a nice touch too.
All the members of staff we met were incredibly amiable and welcoming and went out of their way to ensure their guests were happy.
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and would love to return. 
",5,2016,04,22
115,Elegant Treat,"Seeing that the cost of staying here was not a lot more than other hotels in central London the location off Oxford street near the British Museum we thought we would treat our selves. The Bloomsbury has a touch of class from a bygone age without being dated. We were greeted with hot towels on arrival and found our room to be of a generous size and very comfortable. Marble bathroom and Nespresso coffee machine. On the sixth floor we had a quiet night. Breakfast was very good, hot choices cooked to order with an excellent choice for all tastes on the buffet, booking on arrival was cheaper. The Bar and lobby seating was very attractive. As with most hotels food and drink can be a bit pricey so if you are on a budget; eat out but quite frankly it's worth the experiance of going the whole hog. Will happily return here in the future.",5,2016,04,20
115,Once again....FABULOUS! Would highly recommend,"My partner and I have recently spent a fantastic weekend at the Bloomsbury. I have visited this suburb hotel only once before but felt at home as soon as we walked through the door.  The staff are very warm and welcoming and we instantly felt relaxed, valued and special. Gunilla, made us feel so welcome, she anticipated all of our needs & requirements immediately...a true credit to the hotel. Thank you Gunilla! 

The Attention to detail at this this hotel is at the standard of any 5 star hotel worldwide (I spend at least 2 nights every week in hotels around the world)  & this really is a little gem. 

I believe The Dalloway restaurant is a fairly new edition to the hotel and is definitely somewhere I would frequent & also highly recommend even as a non resident to the hotel. Again, the attention to detail (I love the blankets...great touch) & the ambience is really quite something. It really does have a unique feel about it & again is very warm & welcoming. I would describe this area as Stylish, chic and most contemporary. 
Well done to whomever thought to turn this small, unassuming area into such an exquisite dining/entertaining area...I'll be back with my girlfriends for a long lunch soon!! 

The bedrooms & public areas are all beautifully designed. The beds very comfortable & I do love the aromatherapy associates toiletries & of course the in room Nespresso facility.

Thank you to all at The fabulous Bloomsbury for another great stay. I will continue to recommend.",5,2016,04,20
115,"Weekend in London, revisit a city that we like very much.","We liked the hotel very much. Cosy but with personality. Charming and distinct. Very nice breakfast. The standard room is a little bit small, but with all the necessary amenities. Quiet. The personnel was very nice and helpfull, we would like to compliment André, Miguel and Fàbio. To stay again next time we go to London.",4,2016,04,20
115,Wonderful Hotel and Location,"We stayed here for one night, as we were going to a show in the evening.

Check in was very good, staff very polite and we were surprised to find that they had upgraded our room for free.

We stayed on the 8th floor, the room was exactly what we expected from a hotel of this class, it was very clean, wonderfully decorated and had everything we needed for our stay. The Pod Coffee machine was a delight.

What we hadn't experienced before, was that in the evening whilst we were out, our bed was turned down, cups and glasses washed and coffee pods refilled, and a nice touch was that some chocolates were left by our bed. I could get used to this sort of service.

The Wifi was very good in our room, and very fast.

Breakfast was very good, a choice of cold buffet, which included fruit, cereal, pastries, cold meats and cheese, fruit juice, followed by a hot choice, which was served to our table,  we went for the Full English, which was again very good.

A nice touch was that the Waitress addressed us by our names when ever she came to speak to us.

Coffee, Toast and Jam was served at our table.

Check out was very quick and the doorman opened the door for us as we were leaving.

We would certainly stay here again, as we had a wonderful time, thank you to everyone at the hotel.",5,2016,04,18
115,Nice hotel ,"Stayed here in November as had tickets to a show at the Dominion Theatre which is located just round the corner very convenient.
The hotel looks amazing was clean, tidy and well presented. 
We were quickly checked in the room was modern and had everything you need for an overnight stay. 
The only minor note is we were located next to a lift and you could here it every time it moved not that it bothered me so much but may bother others.
We had a drink at the bar downstairs which was pleasant.
Breakfast was included in our stay and I was very impressed with the selection on offer and the cooked breakfast was very good.
Would stay again. 

 ",5,2016,04,17
115,"Fantastic Hotel, great service in a fantastic location","We have just got back from 3 nights in London, staying at this hotel, as a base while meeting friends and family, and a theatre visit.
The Bloomsbury is in a fantastic location, just round the corner from the British Museum. Tottenham Court Road tube station is a minute away if visiting areas too far too walk, but the central location means you can walk to most tourist destinations easily.
The hotel is superb, in terms of decor, food and staff attention. Our room on the 6th floor was excellent, comfortable, well-appointed  and spacious.
The breakfast was excellent, with a range of a la carte and a buffet.
I cannot recommend this this hotel too highly.",5,2016,04,17
115,A weekend break to celebrate my wifes birthday joined by friends who also stayed at hotel.,"The standard of service and the hotel were excellent. I can,t thank the hotel and it,s staff enough for the way we were treated this weekend.
From the moment we arrived at the hotel nothing was to much trouble. 
The hotel is perfectly sited for level walks to all the main attractions of the city and was 5 mins walk to the tube.
I would have no problem with recommending this hotel.",5,2016,04,17
115,My first stay ever here.....and won't be my last! #superb! ,"We stayed here last night and it was pretty terrific right from the check in until we sadly had to leave the following day. The hotel itself is grand, it's entrance very striking, and can be spotted very easily....it's grandeur sticks out for a mile. 
The location is superb, right in the centre of everything, be it a shopping break, a theatre night or simply a good base for drinks with the girls in Covent Garden....this hotel has to be in my favourite top 5 for location, and luxury. 
We asked for an ice bucket for the champagne which we brought with us and they kindly accommodated. We popped out but on our return, they delivered it and stuck our champers in there ready for our return.....again another thoughtful touch that means so much, but requires so little effort. 
On check in, the kind receptionist upgraded our room for free and the room itself was lovely. Not too small thank fully with plenty of lovely amenities.....an iPod docking station so we could play some music whilst drinking our champagne and get ready. Bathrobes, slippers, a great selection of teas, and a Nespresso machine.....always a nice touch to have these things in your room. The wifi was free and fast, the queen bed was comfortable and I would still be there now if I didn't have to check out! 
The room was warm, cosy, comfortable, extremely quiet and nice and dark with black out blinds. The bathroom had an excellent bath/shower with extremely hot water, good quality free toiletries, plenty of soft white towels, and constant underfloor heating. 
We had heaps of room to put our bags in this room without tripping over them, and were able to hang our stuff up comfortably. 
We ventured down to the bar on the lower ground and I was pleasantly surprised to discover a beautiful moody lit bar with plenty of leather seating and tables, the dimly lit ambience of this little place was so fitting with the hotel. Attached to the side of this bar was an outside undercover terrace lit up with fairy lights, another bar I believe and ample seating. It was very atmospheric, pleasant on the eye and positively charming and romantic. 
The wine was excellent, served in beautiful long stemmed elegant glasses and it was a real pleasure to sit there amongst the regal plush feel of it all. You would hardly think you're in the centre of london....it's like you step back in time with this hotel....the peace and quiet tranquility in tones of regency olives and charcoal greys....it's a sensory delight and a very comfortable luxurious one at that. 
We headed out to soho which the concierge kindly booked our cab to....on our return, they had serviced our room with a turn down service, popping slippers by the bed, bathrobes ready and chocolates by the side. Small simple things like this make dramatic results and that's what makes this hotel stand out amongst so many others that do not go that extra mile. 
The staff from check in right through to the bar attendants and concierge were outstanding, nothing was ever too much trouble and a complete asset to this hotel and should be commended. 
The last time I experienced such beautiful surroundings like this was The Grand in Brighton, this is well on par, if not more so. Will I return? 
Without a shadow of a doubt .....this hotel ticked all my boxes! 
A perfect stay, thank you. 
",5,2016,04,17
115,Front of house let down this gem,"This hotel is ideally located for the Dominion Theatre, the reason for our visit.
On arrival the doormen, who looked nice did not open the door and we had to make our own way in.  The reception/check in is tucked away on the left hand side, we missed this, was not sign posted and was wandering around until someone asked if they could he.
Check in was quick and easy, our room was lovely looking onto the street and we had requested one not on a low floor.
The room was spotless with tea and coffee facilities, only you could only have one cup each.  Whilst we were out the room was turned down for the evening.  The tea cups replaced for clean one, but no more tea bags, so no morning tea.
A bit plus was the excellent free wifi which you dis not have to keep logging into every time you used it.  Bliss.
A big let down to us was the tray left by the lifts.  This was here for the full24 hours of our visit, a bit of not caring? 
Would stay here again but they need to put a little bit more attention to the front of house.",4,2016,04,17
115,Believe the reviews: it's a great place,"I booked this hotel in large part because of previous reviews, and it was a fantastic choice. The size of the room, the bed, the service, the ambience, the little touches like nightly turndown service and two delectable chocolates, or the bottled water that did not have a price tag on it (unlike many U.S. hotels!)... all of these things were right on target and contributed to a wonderful stay. The breakfast that was included in the room was sumptuous enough to make lunch unnecessary, and everyone on the staff seemed genuinely happy to be there and to help. I had a few very minor quibbles about my room, including a TV remote that needed to be whacked on a regular basis to continue working and a shower that seemed too hot no matter how I adjusted the dials; but these are not worth dwelling upon. The location can't be beat: it's a relatively quiet street (and the double-paned windows ensured a quiet sleep) and an easy walk to either Tottenham Court or Holborn. I'll definitely return and would recommend The Bloomsbury highly.",5,2016,04,16
115,My first experience in London.,"My husband and I went to settle our daughter in Dudley, England where she is studying medicine, We decided to make it a short vacation trip as well and stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel located on Russel Street before heading back to Trinidad where we live. The Hotel itself is beautiful and the rooms are modern, clean but a bit small (superior room). The breakfast was included at a price of 26 pounds, which was a little expensive.
The dinners that we had at the Landseer, however, were amazing, exceptional and delightful - value for money.
The staff are very polite and helpful. The guy at the bar was friendly and engaging. He knew his drinks quite well...has been working at the Hotel for a long time.
My first experience in London was excellent and if I had to return, I would stay at the Bloomsbury again. It is in a centralised area where you are close to the shopping, tours and theatres.",5,2016,04,16
115,Excellent hotel!,"We’ve just got back from a long weekend at The Bloomsbury. The location is excellent and our room & bathroom were very comfortable, well equipped and clean. We found the service outstanding. The staff were warmly welcoming, while professional, and made us feel at home. Every morning got off to a great start with smiles and good service in the breakfast room from Estelita and Alex. Highly recommended!",5,2016,04,14
115,Terrific hotel,"I stayed for three nights in April 2016. The staff in the hotel and restaurant is professional, polite, and helpful. Especially Mia, Aladdin, Martina, and Dionne. The hotel location was convenient for me. Room was nice and comfortable. All went well.",5,2016,04,12
115,"Prime Location, Friendly and professional staff, excellent ambience and facilities","I tried to give a small tip to one of the staff who helped me with the luggage at the check-in, his reply to me was astonishing. He said back (my tip is you to be have comfortable stay, and enjoying your time) !! What an amazing start.. 

I was there for 7 nights, which is more than enough to analyze the hotel. I found it very interesting, and a place that you can stay in with no issues so whatever. I have stayed in different 5 and 4 starts hotel, and I’m pretty sure this hotel has a brilliant ambience, quite location, and good facilities. I tend to believe it’s one the excellent hotels I’ve been to in the UK/Europe, considering the following: 

Location: 
Prime location, and away from the crowd and noisy nights. Only couple of minutes’ walk to the Oxford St, and few more to the British Museum. It’s located in a great area where you can find and get anything you want. Also, the underground station is within a walking distance, about 2 minutes from the hotel (Tottenham Court Road Station). 

Lobby:
Elegant, very relaxing and warm feelings around.. I could set there for hours enjoying the atmosphere, and listening to the Piano sometime. 

Staff: 
I’m very pleased with the all the staff I met in the hotel, every corner of it. They made me feel welcomed, and comfortable. They were very friendly, professional, and overwhelming.  The reception was hospitable, and I got a professional welcoming card at the room, with an offer of a complementary drink, which I didn’t use .. May be next time ! 

Rooms: 
I liked my room very much which has a sufficient space for everything. It’s well organized to make the movement smooth, and convenient.. I was pleased to see how the room is matching with the professional photos provided by the hotel. Very good condition, and comfy.  Sometimes I could hear what’s next door, or people passing by the corridor, but only if they are a bit loud. Otherwise, all great, and I won’t think of a better room and service. Generally the hotel is very quiet, and hardly to notice any disturbing sounds or noises.. Moreover, I appreciated the chocolate truffles and water bottles served in the room, Still and Sparkling.. I think that’s a very admirable touch that added a lot of bonus to the room.  

Bathroom: 
It has a touch of luxurious.. Everything was alright, sufficient space, and just how I wanted it to be…  The marble, the big window glass, the toiletries, and bathrobe. Yet there are small things, but didn’t make any impact on my stay. For example, the high shower head that I couldn’t reach, but it was working just fine. Also, the shower door needs small work to be prefect, and the slow drainage of the hands washing sink. As I said, it didn’t affect the stay or needed an urgent fix, or made me uncomfortable at any point. 

Dinning/Cafes/Bar: 
They have this lovely Dalloway Terrace, with indoor and outdoor seating. Irresistible place, and must visit when in London... I didn’t worry about the windy cold weather outside, they kept the place warm enough to enjoy the time. Also, there is a bar downstairs, which has a lovely ambience and decoration. They also serve food from the main restaurant for both, which I believe it was delicate and delicious. I had the grilled Salmon with Rocket Parmesan Salad on the side.. 
The staff were nice in general, with smiley faces that makes every experience unique, and very helpful about anything. I think these are 2 of the nice places in London that must be included in every visit to the city. 
Also, their breakfast buffet is convenient and worth a try..  

Housekeeping: 
The room is always neat, clean and looks fresh.. The staff have done great job keeping the room cleaned properly, very professional and trustworthy. 

WIFI is all over the hotel, and the speed is good already.. There are more facilities in the hotel, such as the Gym, meeting rooms, etc… but didn’t use them..",5,2016,04,12
115,Great location,"Overall this was an excellent hotel. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is due to two factors one, is the air conditioning system. It randomly goes off and you have to remember to turn it back on. This is quite impossible to do while you were sleeping! Air-conditioning is a feature in a hotel that is very important to me so this was a big problem. The second issue was  housekeeping.  They sometimes forgot to replace things like toilet paper and soap, They were certainly nice and pleasant.
otherwise this is a great hotel, very nice large rooms, the staff at the front desk and everyone else I encountered did an excellent job. The location of the hotel is fantastic and I would have considered staying there again as I travel to London often but the dealbreaker for me was the air-conditioning system.

115,Wonderful hotel for 80th birthday surprise,"We spent the last weekend at this great hotel, a surprise for my for my 80th birthday. And what a great surprise it was.  We upgraded and had an extremely pleasant, clean room, clean towels every day and everything you would  expect for your money.  The staff were extremely patient and good, and as my husband put it ""friendly but not familiar and polite but, not obsequious"", which fits the bill.  It has an air of an old well established hotel, but is modernised to perfection.  I must say a word about the Mrs, Dalloway terrace bistro,and cocktail bar, part of which is outside, and part inside with heaters and superb rugs if you feel the cold.  We ate here on our second night and wished we had eaten there on the first night, really lovely food, beautifully cooked. We also had free cocktails  there on our arrival which was very welcoming.  We saved them for our evening meal, no bother to the staff. We would most certainly stay there again. Thank you staff at the Bloomsbury for making my rather ancient birthday so perfect.",5,2016,04,11
115,Great weekend! ,"Just returned from a 2 night stay here. The service is fantastic, on our arrival we were welcomed by a very friendly check in staff member . We booked a standard room it was very comfortable with nice decor. The stay was for my birthday, a cake and card were waiting for us in our room, which was a lovely touch. They also gave us complimentary glass of bubbly at the pre theatre dinner we had booked. The food is of a very high standard, we booked breakfast and they had a great selection of food. The full English was fantastic! We also ate here before we went to the theatre, for £20 pp delicious food . Can't fault the hotel, we will definitely be making a return visit soon. ",5,2016,04,10
115,Great stay for Theatre visit!,"The location was key for our visit to The Dominion theatre and The Bloomsbury did not disappoint! We opted for the luxury room as it was only £20 more than the standard (at £300, you've already done the hard work, may as well go the full hog!)

Upon arrival our room wasn't ready, we expected this as it was about 12.30pm. The reception staff offered us a warm towel as it was a cold day and the porter relieved us of our luggage and were free to head out for lunch.

Upon our return, the room was ready and our luggage was brought straight up.

The room was fantastic! Very grand, as you would expect from this kind of hotel, and very modern. There was great storage space, provided by a massive wardrobe and coat/umbrella stand also. A full size desk with internet access and a 42in television on the wall.

The bathroom well presented, modern and spacious, featuring a walk in wetroom style showers as well as a separate bath.

Unfortunately we didn't get a chance to use the hotel bar, though we had every intention to, we were too tired after the theatre and went straight to the room.

All in all, we had a great stay at The Bloomsbury and would recommend it highly.",5,2016,04,10
115,A Truly Wonderful Stay at The Bloomsbury!,"What a terrific hotel! This was our first time to London and we were very impressed by The Bloomsbury. From the moment we entered the hotel, we knew we had made a great choice. We found it to be centrally located and the staff was terrific (especially Andre, who helped us with various on a few occasions) and the doorman (whose name I didn't get...). Our daughter has been at college in London for more than seven months now (on the same street, no less) and, due to her knowledge, we were able to get all over town quickly. There are two underground stations nearby but we found ourselves walking everywhere we could, which we thoroughly enjoyed. The hotel is beautiful throughout... the lobby, the restaurant, the bar and our room. We didn't get a chance to partake in the restaurant but hear it's terrific. Our room was on the 5th floor towards the back of the hotel and was very quiet... it's a pretty quiet area anyhow so no need to worry about noise. The bed was  splendid. There were some nice amenities that you would, of course, expect from a first-class hotel such as The Bloomsbury. A nice, luxurious touch was the heated bathroom floors. Daily paper, an assortment of cookies and teas/coffees, an espresso machine, etc... and an umbrella, which we needed one night! Just a terrific stay and we highly recommend the hotel to those who enjoy the finer things in life. Well done, my friends, well done.",5,2016,04,09
115,Exellent hotel,"We stayed for 4 nights. the hotel location is fantastic. close to oxford street, to covent garden, and to underground. the room was very clean, cosy and warm. we got a room facing the street which was very nice, towels were changed twice a day. the staff were very kind and helpful. we loved the hotel.",5,2016,04,09
115,Lovely Hotel.,"Well located, just minutes from busy Tottenham Court Road/Oxford Street, 2 minutes walk to the British Museum. This hotel is steeped in history, as would be with a grade 2 listed building. The interior is faithful to the period feel of the building with the rooms (well certainly the one I stayed in) well equipped with lovely furnishings, accessories and a very stylish bathroom.  The entire place was spotlessly clean.  The turn down service was a nice touch, where, they also took the opportunity to do a mini room service and change towels/replenish used items like coffee, tea, milk etc that you might have used.  I would like to add a small caution, this is NOT a budget hotel so do not expect to get budget prices, anything you order i.e. breakfast (especially a cooked one) comes extra. Connection to WiFi is free and worked in rooms and public areas OK.  The staff were excellent, very helpful and informative.  An ideal place for that special occasion.!",5,2016,04,08
115,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent location, service, staff and decoration. Whatelse would You deserve from staying in a big city like London? And if you get lucky to be attended by Andre Gonçalves, you will have a perfect stay. He will help you with everything you will need like restaurants, bars, transfers, etc. Very friendly!",5,2016,04,07
115,Beautiful reception hall,"On arriving we managed to park the car opposite the hotel, whilst we checked in with our bags, and asked the concierge where would be the best place to park. As we usually only stay in five star hotels, we trust the judgment of these highly trained individuals implicitly. He suggested that we did not drive straight on ( one way street) as we were literally feet from the junction, but to reverse this short distance as the car park was opposite. This we did, only to receive a fine from Westminster council this morning for £130. We are aware that as drivers it is our duty to be vigilant.However, as we were told this was the usual practice, we duly took his advice. The hotel is in a good location , most sights being within walking distance. The reception, bars, and rooms are all immaculate. The hotel's web sight does no justice to the interior. The bar on the Saturday evening was totally void of guests, and as it is rather dark we found it quite oppressive, therefore decided to have pre dinner drinks in reception, where others were enjoying the ambience ( the pretty conservatory busy with diners at this time).Bad move! The older male that we presumed to be the beverage manager,was totally disorganised and chaos reigned, even though apart from ourselves no one else appeared to need serving. He had to be reminded twice of our order, and twice got it wrong. The lack of communication between himself and his young team appeared non existent. We were hoping to enjoy a relaxed and happy few drinks before heading out. Unfortunately,this was not the case and we made an hurried exit for our dinner date. On our return, we too experienced non verbal aggravation by a server in the bar ( as did a previous reviewer) even though the bar confirms that it is open until 2 a.m. At midnight we made our way to our room. For us enjoying a relaxed weekend break wasn't to be. The hiccups we encountered didn't spoil our stay completely, but did take the sheen of what was supposed to be a memorable stay(husband's 60th).",4,2016,04,06
115,Fabulous hotel,"Stayed at The Bloomsbury for 9 nights around Easter 2016. We have stayed at this hotel once before. Was very pleased the last time and even more this time.
The staff was very friendly. Check in was quick and easy. And the hotel has the best customer relations team. We were treated so well when our room wasn't ready as promised at 14.00 (turned out we only had to wait for about 15 minutes after all).
The hotel is in a perfect location just off Oxford Street and very close to Tottenham Court Road tube station (with both Central and Northern line). 
The hotel itself has a very nice, relaxed and calm atmosphere. Lovely to sit in the lobby bar with a drink. The Club Bar down stairs was nice too.
The small fitness center in the basement was basic but good and gave us the possibility to get some exersice even when the weather outside was bad. Extra plus for free water and towels down at the fitness center.
The finish of the hotel is perfect. It felt very well kept and well managed. 

On the down side was the fact that the tray with coffee, boiler and mugs was placed inside the closet. When you hanged all your clothes in it was a bit difficult to reach the coffee and those straws just kept flying out when grabbing a new shirt in the morning. Also didn't feel totally good that the staff had to go through my clothes to be able to refill the coffee/tea/water.",5,2016,04,05
115,"Great staff, great food","My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary by going to the theatre. Before the show, we dined at The Bloomsbury. From the moment we arrived, our experience was superb. We were exceptionally well looked after at our table by Martina and Aladdin (I'm sorry, I didn't get the name of the delightful restaurant receptionist), and our every need was dealt with efficiently and quickly. 
The food was very good indeed. Smoked salmon with Guinness bread (yum!), followed by exceptional lamb fillet with couscous and aubergine pate, followed by Valhrona & pecan nut slice with salted caramel ice cream (the best ice cream ever, according to my other half). The chef was certainly on top of his game.
Over our prosecco, Martina gleaned from us that it was our wedding anniversary - Aladdin then surprised us by adding a couple of totally unexpected touches on the house, viz a lovely NZ pinot noir to go with my lamb and the most sumptuous lemon tart (on a plate which had been decorated with suitable words by the chef). This really made our day feel even more special, and I cannot thank Aladdin and Martina enough for their attentive and wonderful service.
We will certainly be booking a return visit soon.",5,2016,04,05
115,Simple but elegant,"This hotel was a nice surprise. Although it is located in the heart of the city, you don't hear anything once inside and you can't beat the location. The room we had was clean and had nice amenities, including a Nespresso machine, which was a bonus. 
We ate breakfast here one morning and that was also great. I would highly recommend it.",5,2016,04,04
115,"Great location, fabulous hotel.","My husband and I stayed in this hotel for a birthday weekend away.  The location is absolutely perfect.  Its the first time we have been to London and not used the tube at all.  Everything is within walking distance!!  The room wasn't huge but was immaculate and even had tea & coffee making facilities (including a nespresso machine) which is unusual for a top London hotel.  The staff were all lovely.  The bar man down stairs makes a fabulous cocktail (try the Fizzy Rascal!) and despite how busy he was, was chatty and made us very welcome.  Pedro on reception is so helpful.  Check in and check out were quick and hassle free.  Managed to get a good deal that included breakfast..which was delicious.  I think you would struggle to find a nicer hotel in a better location in London.  We'll be back!!",5,2016,04,04
115,Elegance and Ambiance,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is a tasteful and charming place to stay. When in London I usually stay at hotels in the West End. The Bloomsbury Hotel is walking distance to the West End, and on a quiet street in an attractive area of the city. I highly recommend The Bloomsbury Hotel, and will indeed stay there again in the future. The room was well appointed and comfortable. The club bar is a wonderful place to have a cocktail with friends. ",5,2016,04,04
115,Hidden gem,"Quaint spot off the beaten path but conveniently located to shopping in Soho, Covent Garden, etc. we stay here twice a year and it is always pleasant. Great, friendly service. The bar downstairs is a hidden gem. Joel and Mathew are exceptional bartenders and great conversationalists in the same. Craft cocktails, downtempo Jazz, moody lighting and traditional, den-like decor give this spot a real charm. Highly recommended for the casual or business traveler.",5,2016,04,03
115,Theatre stay,"We stayed here for a weekend in the middle of March. I booked this hotel due to its location being so near to the Shaftesbuy theatre where we were attending  Motown the Musical. 
It was the final part of my gift to my husband for our 40th wedding anniversary. 
Our room was well equipped clean with a very comfortable bed, although it did seem a bit crowded. We had a Deluxe King  room which we expected to find a walk-in shower but it had a shower over the bath which was a bit disappointing as I have knee trouble.
The Staff were very helpful, friendly and always with a smile except one who we felt let the hotel down. The Gentleman in the downstairs club bar did not seem at all impressed when we were taken down for a late night drink after our theatre show on the Friday , he raised his arms in the air and sighed. As we were the only ones there I'm guessing he was hoping for an early night. The young girl who served us  made up for his behaviour she was amazing.
Breakfast in the morning was again very good we both had the full English cooked to order so it was lovely and fresh.
We were going out again  on the Saturday night and had planned to leave the hotel at about 6pm for our dinner reservation.
Unfortunately when we arrived back at the hotel at 3pm our room had not been serviced I rang the reception where I was told that there had been a lot of departures and so they were very busy but they would send someone up straight away or we could have it done after we had gone out for the evening (which I thought was quite strange.) So we made our way down to the Dalloway Terrace for a drink which is a very nice place to relax but not if you are getting a bit anxious about your evening meal reservation.
We gave it 1 hr 30mins before we asked at the desk again whether the room was ready, this time she went off to check this took about 10 mins we were then told yes , we made our way to our room and arrived just as the housekeeping staff were leaving. So quick showers and out again. 
On returning that night we again went downstairs for a drink where there was a saxophonist playing who was brilliant and it was also very busy. The young girl was rushed off her feet but she always had a smile I'm sorry I don't know her name.
Checkout was easy and taxis were very prompt all in all we enjoyed our stay but the little problems means a 4 not a 5 review.
Yes we would come back and stay again.",4,2016,04,01
115,Great Location,"The Bloomsbury is a lovely Hotel in a great location for sightseeing and theatres. Staff is very friendly and efficient, although housekeeping is a bit inconsistent - no complimentary waters left in room, no soap replaced and tea bag/coffee not refreshed either. However these were minor things that we felt too picky to complain about. The rooms are quite small but comfortable with bathrobes and slippers provided. We had a room that looked into a courtyard which was fine for us as we were out most of the time anyway. Our first night we ate on the terrace and the food was excellent as was the service, prices too were very reasonable for a lovely hotel in the heart of London. It was my birthday and there was a rather large chocolate cake along with card in outer room, nice touch and made my day. Would definitely return but maybe not in peak season as it is quite pricey.",4,2016,03,31
115,"Lovely hotel , poor receptionist ","Hotel was gorgeous and also very central to stay . But the receptionist at the time wasn't very helpful with directing us to where we receive breakfast and because we were unable to find the room ,we had to leave without any because we had a meeting to attend.",4,2016,03,27
115,Stylish bar in a Beautiful Hotel,"After visiting Hakkasan for lunch we searched on our phones to see what was nearby for drinks afterwards. 

We found the Bloomsbury club at the Bloomsbury hotel. There's a really nice Terrace, and a couple of really nice indoor bars also. 

As well as having a great ambiance, what set it apart for us was the amazing service. The two staff that looked after us were just perfect. Attentive, friendly and so genuinely pleased to be there. 

They made our day so perfect, we decided to book a room at the hotel in a few months time before our honeymoon. 

Could not recommend this place more. ",5,2016,03,27
115,"Nicely redone rooms, good location","We had a very nice room, redone recently I gather. A small noise issue from a club behind The hotel at times (when someone opened the back door to go out for a smoke I suspect), but otherwise quiet and very nice. Breakfast was good, but expensive to my Canadian standards. 
Very close to the theatre district, to the Brirish Museum. Great location on a quiet side street.",4,2016,03,26
115,A lovely hotel,"We had a lovely stay at the Bloomsbury. Family visit for celebration of my husband receiving his OBE from Buckingham Palace. The welcome was great, rooms comfortable if a little small, breakfast was fab, and our lunch in the terrace restaurant was perfect. The staff were friendly and helpful, and nothing was too much trouble. The bottle of champagne in our room was a lovely gesture, thank you. ",5,2016,03,26
115,Great place to be,We had a warm welcome and the excellent service made our stay perfect. The room was calm and had a spacious bathroom. We liked to have Londons highlights in a walking distance. The rich breakfast gave us power for the day.,5,2016,03,26
115,Great hotel,"I have been staying at The Bloomsbury multiple times and I have never been disappointed. Great location, great staff (my favorite: Joel at the bar. I go there every 6 months and he always makes me feel welcome and special), great rooms. Very satisfied with everything there. I would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat.",5,2016,03,25
115,"Great Location, Great Staff, GREAT Value.",This was my third stay at The Bloomsbury and I can't imagine staying anywhere else.  The location is perfect for shopping and sight seeing.  It is a comfortable hotel with great staff.  We capped every evening in the The Bloomsbury Club downstairs because the bar staff was so engaging.,5,2016,03,25
115,Fantastic find,Perfect location in walking distance to the city oxford street picadilly westminster covent garden etc. Fab hotel great ambiance lovely room which was upgraded for my birthday together with a suprise cake. Staff are polite and attentive nothing was too much trouble. We ate at the delamare terrace alfresco dining at the hotel and the food and service was perfection. Very romantic with candles fairy lights and heaters. Would we stay there again - yes without hesitation. A fab few days in london,5,2016,03,24
115,Lovely Stay,"I really enjoyed my time at the The Bloomsbury hotel. The staff was wonderful- very nice and attentive and professional. The level of service they provide is refreshing and definitely appreciated. Overall, my room was very comfortable and clean. The hotel restaurant is also very good, and I was really impressed by the continental breakfast selection. Would stay again, for sure!",5,2016,03,24
115,"Great location, everything you need for a mid priced hotel","We stayed at the Bloomsbury for a week on a recent whirlwind tour of London. It was great.  The location was excellent, with the tube station and bus stops virtually at the end of the street and the knowledgable concierge assisting us with our travels. We could easily walk to all of the attractions, Leicester Square and various theatres all within 10-15 minutes.  There was ample shopping on nearby Oxford Street and nothing was more that a short tube ride away.  We chose to walk everywhere and then tube home, with most things within 10km. The staff were helpful, bed comfy and room small but ample for what we needed; somewhere to crash at the end of an adventurous day.",4,2016,03,23
115,Perfect hotel in a perfect location,"Stayed here this month for one night. The hotel was warm and friendly and the staff helpful and efficient. Our room was comfortable with everything we needed. A short walk to the British Museum and close to the underground. Our evening meal was beautifully served and very delicious and the breakfast first class with fresh yogurt, fruit and perfect scrambled eggs. We booked this hotel with theatre tickets and were very happy with our choice.  I will definitely stay there again!",5,2016,03,23
115,"Highly recommended due to location, service and rooms. not Excellent due to breakfast and shower water pressure quality.","Had a long and lovely stay here. Excellent prime location right next to the Totenham could road underground station, 10 minutes walk on Oxford street to Oxford circus and 15 minutes walk to Covent garden. Endless veritable of quality food around and shopping with Primark, Muji and Tiger, my favorites, just across the road. Try the tiny Korean place just next to the hotel for genuine straight forward meal. 
Beautiful and quit room, modernly designed and reasonably sized. 
Hotels personnel get 10 out of 10 for being welcoming, helpful and smily always at front desk, roomservice and housekeeping. Say hi to Xxx at the concierge stand who helped me with my un reasonable amount of luggage. 
Good roomservice food!
The two things the hotel needs to improve is the water pressure in the shower. Had to use the hand shower head for 8 days because of it. Quality shower is a must at the end of the day and here it's just not enjoyable.
The other thing is the very basic breakfast. At times when even smaller hotels offer opulent buffet breakfast you simply can't drop the level and charge for it. Not even the famous English breakfast offered. 
Still, I recommend staying here and would love to come back.",4,2016,03,22
115,Amazing. Exactly what you want from a stay at a hotel in London,"Everything was so fantastic. I was organising a work Christmas party and had to use a lot of assistants from the staff, carrying boxes, checking everyone in their rooms quickly, keeping things delivered for me at reception - just really helpful.

The place is spectacularly beautiful, with lovely little rooms and great bathrooms. Clean and comfy throughout. Only bad part would be trying to drive around this place! but that's no the hotels fault.

I had breakfast here which was pretty good, I cant remember how much it cost so wouldn't be able to say if it was good value. It's located right near the British Museum, so if you fancy getting in some culture too.",5,2016,03,22
115,"Location great, hotel great, room dissapointing!","We won a night's stay in a deluxe room that would ordinarily cost close to £300 I believe. 
The hotel itself was impressive and the location was great but the room itself was very disappointing - small, pokey, dark and there were stains on the chairs and blinds. There was also a lot of noise from the neighbouring room. If I had paid that price I would be livid; I have stayed in cheaper hotels that are much nicer! To finish on a positive the staff were very helpful also it really was the room itself that let the whole experience down. I wouldn't return.",3,2016,03,22
115,Perfect Boutique Hotel,"Beautiful hotel with really great, knowledgeable staff. Concierge made a great dinner recommendation - and made our reservation for us. Effortless. 

Rooms were great, quiet and well appointed. 

We had a small meeting here - and it was also superb (less than 10 people).

Would stay here again - perfect hotel if you're in town for business but also want to explore the city a bit.

The only room for improvement I can think of - the wifi was a bit slow at some times, but not always. ",5,2016,03,19
115,Lovely relaxing weekend in London....,"We booked a one night stay for a birthday celebration for my partner. The room was great, comfortable and spacious, and beautifully quiet, in spite of the central location of the hotel, which was perfect for us, as we had booked a show at the Dominion Theatre - which turned out to be a five minute walk away! We also enjoyed visiting the British Museum, which is only 5 minutes in the other direction.
All in all, we had a comfortable and relaxing stay, without any stress. The bed was comfortable, the breakfast great, all the staff were delightfully friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed the small birthday cake that was provided - a nice surprise!",4,2016,03,18
115,Lovely hotel and very good breakfast,"Location of the hotel is excellent: very close to an Underground stop, but within walking distance of many sights (about 5 minutes to the British Museum, 20 minutes to the National Gallery, and 30 minutes to Buckingham Palace).  The location is very quiet though-- I never noticed any street noise (and my room faced Great Russell St.).  There is a grocery close by if you're staying on the cheap, and many restaurant options in the area (Malabar Junction is across the street and very good for Indian).  The room itself was lovely and much larger than I had anticipated and housekeeping/concierge was very good, especially at the price level for the hotel. Public areas are really quite beautiful, and you'll be tempted to stay in and enjoy them rather than go out and see sights!

Breakfast was generally excellent; the hostess Maria is lovely and remembers the guest from morning to morning.  My only complaint was the one time I went to the bar: the wait staff seemed completely inept.  Fortunately this didn't affect me, but it did a couple of parties seated outside in the enclosure.  I witnessed food that was delivered incorrectly-- orders went to wrong parties, the bartender didn't know how to make certain kinds of drinks, checks were not calculated correctly.  I don't know if it was just an ""off night"" or if this was typical; again, I was only observing this rather than involved in these difficulties (I encountered none of my own).  

I look forward to returning to the Bloomsbury in the future-- it will be a home base in London from now on!",5,2016,03,17
115,"Hotel room comfortable, conference facilities/services need some work","I stayed at this hotel for a work event being held in the hotel meeting rooms.   My room was clean and comfortable and had a few thoughtful touches (like two USB charging stations), Nespresso and a hot-pot.  There was no electrical outlet that I could find in the bathroom (except for shaver), which made using a straight-iron a HUGE challenge.  The bed was comfortable.  The bathroom is clean and well lit.  Makeup mirror in a weird spot over toilet- i suppose it could have moved it to the bedroom.  

the conference facilities are spread over multiple floors- so going up and down all day.  The food served for lunch was truly awful (chicken was cold and bland, fish was tasteless, and we ""stood"" for lunch).  

I went to the restaurant two days for breakfast, it was odd that we were all told we did not have breakfast included in our rate, but yet,  I was the only one presented with a charge slip at end of breakfast, other two were waved off and told not to worry about it.  Very odd.  You can order eggs, cooked to order, and that was nice.  it was 18 gbp for breakfast.

Check out the cool 'cave' bar;  it was a great little spot we discovered with amazing ambiance-  service was TERRIBLE as we had to keep finding the staff to order drinks.  I've honestly never had to getup that many times to get another beer or food orders for the table; but when we did get food and drinks, they were perfect.  We had appetizers, etc.

Sleep quality was a little tough due to doors banging closed in the hallway thru the night- not the hotels' fault, but maybe they could put soft close features on the doors so this can't happen.  

the history is fantastic- read the book in your room- neat to explore the nooks and crannies of the hotel- enjoy that :)  

The hotel is in a great spot- lots of little shops, bars and restaurants in close proximity.  very convenient.  Front doorman was extremely helpful with taxi's and such.  Front desk staff were super friendly.",4,2016,03,17
115,Beautiful hotel in central London,"My wife and I were staying overnight in London and we chose The Bloomsbury Hotel because the 'deal' seemed to be exceptional value (i.e.approx. £165.00 instead of about £440.00.

The hotel was very, very good indeed. Staff were friendly and attentive, the ambience of the hotel was extremely congenial and the overall attention to detail was outstanding.

Our room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. Our one (potential) criticism, however, is that the room was quite small (meaning that the bed was only a regular 'double' size rather than king or queen size). The bathroom was also relatively small although the quality of toiletries, towels etc was very good. Nevertheless, at £165.00 the hotel provided exceptional value. I very much doubt, however, that I would be prepared to pay £400.00 plus for a room of this size. ",5,2016,03,16
115,Great stay,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury for a theatre weekend, we found the hotel to be in a great location, closed to everything we wanted.   The staff were excellent and we had a very comfortable room.   In the morning we had a very delicious full english which set us up very well for a day of shopping.   100% recommend this hotel.",5,2016,03,16
115,Pleasantly surprised. BUT,"Stayed at weekend with friends as a birthday treat  was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the hotel as we normally stay at the Savoy or Hotel 41. However the staff lack polish and were unorganised   We requested a kingsize bed and advised it was a special occasion but were given a small double.   when phoning hotel to organise parking after being put through to voicemail twice and speaking to someone who didn't have good English language skills we were finally told no valet parking but car park nearby, they did not have address or postcode so we were unable to enter location on sat nav, ended up parking some distance away. 
The new bar was lovely.  although the girls serving appeared to be doing their best the manager seemed totally out of his depth and more interested in chatting to a few customers at the bar or arguing with the staff who were pleading with him to prepare  drinks that they had taken orders for from customers sitting at the tables.  We waited 45minutes to be served with our drinks  even though we saw our waitress pleading with the bar manager to prepare the drinks he seemed pre occupied  we were not alone and witnessed 3 other patrons complaining about the length of time  it is a shame because the terrace and bar area could be a massive plus if run in a professional manner. 
In conclusion. This is a reasonable priced hotel the rooms are well appointed and clean the public areas are comfortable and pleasant.  Well located for soho theatre land.   but let down by poor management. We visit London quite. Regularly and would stay again if the management issues were addressed.",3,2016,03,15
115,First Class,"Lovely hotel, great location.  We were upgraded on arrival to a fabulous room with everything you could possibly need during your stay. Breakfast was a real treat. All the staff very friendly and helpful.",5,2016,03,15
115,A good choice,"In a nutshell: Simply a very good hotel.
Don't know why it's rated 4-star. I've been to 5-star hotels with a worse experience..
Location is great - central but quiet. Quality of bed is outstanding. 
Breakfast can be a little bit chaotic on Sunday morning.
Rooms are good for 2 - a little bit tiny for 3 with a rollaway bed.
Service is excellent.
",5,2016,03,15
115,Just there for afternoon tea,"The four of us came here for an afternoon tea after a visit to the British museum. I found a deal on the web, so decided to give it a try. We walked in, and the tea place is right by the right hand side of the main entrance. it was 2-ish in the afternoon and they seem not ready for the tea people. We stood for 5 minutes, the waiter/ress walk in and out not noticing us. Finally we were seated, and another 10 minutes before anyone came to ask us. All in all, service is slow, maybe due to understaff but there weren't that many people, maybe 3 tables that is.  
To give you an example, how slow they were. There was a table of 3 of a mom with 2 young girls, they waited so long, when the mom finally said something at the end of their tea, each of the girl was given a teddy bear to amend. 
Now, the tea and cakes and sandwich was nothing to write home about.  all cake/desserts are just sweet, no other taste.  We didn't finish our food and left.",3,2016,03,14
115,Wonderful experience.,"I booked this hotel as we were going to the theatre around the corner, so glad I did.  I booked a standard room and found that it was much better than some of the premier rooms I've stayed in other hotels.  The staff were very attentive and nothing was too much trouble.  The pre-theatre meal was fab as was the breakfast the next morning, plenty of buffet and cooked breakfast.  Would go back in a heart beat.",5,2016,03,14
115,Weekend away in London,"Our third visit to The Bloomsbury. We've not had one negative experience during any of our stays. From front desk, waiters and maids that we encountered around the hotel the entire staff were friendly, polite and welcoming. Well appointed, clean and comfortable room - the bed was exceptionally comfortable. We used the Dalloway Terrace for the first time, a lovely quiet setting with a peaceful ambience - a million miles from the hustle and bustle feel of London. We are already looking forward to our next visit. ",5,2016,03,14
115,Good Hotel,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is one of the best option to stay in London. Very good service, rooms  and location. It is very suitable for business trips. I'll recommend the hotel and I'll return in the future. ",5,2016,03,12
115,Lovely bar & restaurant,"We didn't stay in the hotel but we visited the bar & restaurant the food was lovely with great presentation (2 courses & 2 bottles of wine came to about £60 for the 2 of us), the staff were very attentive they reserved us a table on the terrace after our meal & brought out our last bottle of wine, I was also offered a blanket the staff even wrapped it around my shoulders which was a nice touch, the smoking terrace area also has blankets & heaters so is not too cold, I think this place is going to be great in the summer too, highly recommended.",4,2016,03,12
115,Comfortable staying ,"Staying in this hotel is a big pleasure. Great location, clean, high quality and very friendly personnel! Breakfasts are very tasty with a big variety of delicious dishes. 
Special thanks to Estelita who is always very friendly, considerate and careful! ",5,2016,03,12
115,Great Experience,"My wife, daughter and I just spent a week at the hotel. The location is ideal for the British Museum and for west end theatres. The hotel is very well-appointed; the service is of a very high standard; and the meals both at breakfast and for dinners were a wonderful experience.",5,2016,03,11
115,Beyond disappointed,"We frequently come to London, and have a ""favourite and regular"" hotel we stay in, but for a change, and because we were going to a show at the Dominion, we opted to stay at this hotel. Firstly the good points... Staff very friendly, bed comfortable, and wonderful large towels. On the downside... We were given a disabled access room, not requested, not required, which involved a bathroom which was like a wet room, so water everywhere when one showered, the level of the sink just above knee level, and no toilet seat cover ... Why ???  When I made an enquiry, it seemed that because I had requested a walk in shower rather than one over the bath, and because all these rooms were full, we had the disabled access room. The room was comfortable if extremely small, no bottle of water which most hotel leave automatically, and a door on the bathroom which was coming off its hinges and "" stuck"" a few inches on trying to enter the room. Two mentions of this to reception appeared to have the same outcome...nil!!! When we went to shower late afternoon on day two before going out ,we found the shower gel and shampoo used that morning hadn't been replaces, just 3/4 empty tubes. Likewise no replacement of biscuits and coffee.  The toilet door did eventually get fixed, as we were about to leave.... Unlikely to return ",3,2016,03,10
115,Flawless ,"I and two colleagues, stayed a week at the hotel and used one of the small conference rooms for business meetings each day. Both that facility and the bedrooms were perfectly set out, managed and appointed. The staff were brilliant right from the point of booking through to departure. The hotel's location was also very convenient for business guests to locate and access. The nearby huge range of restaurants and pubs, also made it a pleasant area in which to spend a working week away from home. Overall, a flawless experience. ",5,2016,03,10
115,Wonderful meeting rooms,"I often book meeting rooms in the Bloomsbury for work purposes as the meeting rooms within our office hold only a small number of people.  The staff at the Bloomsbury are always incredibly helpful and accommodating, making sure that our meetings run smoothly wherever possible.  Beautiful rooms, wonderful food and top notch service.",4,2016,03,09
115,My Stay at the Bloombury,"I paid for a Triple room for 2 adults and a child for 2 nights (room 315). We only got a small room with a double bed and a small adjustable bed pushed into the room. This further restricted movement in an already tight space.
The telephone was not working (not connected) so went downstairs to the reception for requests.
The toilet fan to expel air was not working even after we complained.
We were charged for the extra bed they pushed into the room until we complained that a Triple room was paid for before they removed the charge.
The beds were uncomfortable. 
I would not recommend this hotel to anyone for the price we paid. ",2,2016,03,09
115,a pleasant experience for a great vacation,"My wife and I stayed in Bloomsbury hotel for 3 nights.at march 2016. It was one of the best hotels we have ever been. Excellent hotel, great location, very clean, well designed and very friendly stuff. Absolutely a pleasant experience for a great vacation. 

",5,2016,03,08
115,Great hotel,I stayed 5 nights at this property while in London for business.  The hotel is in an excellent location close to everything and a stones throw from the British Museum.  Service at this boutique hotel was excellent and the staff goes out of their way to make your stay comfortable.  I would definitely stay here again.,5,2016,03,08
115,Grand hotel in a great location,"The Bloomsbury is a lovely, well presented hotel.  The entrance and bar are very sophisticated, and the staff very helpful and polite.  Our room was a decent size for the west-end of London with a very comfortable bed, decent shower and all the expected amenities.  Breakfast was served on the lower ground, with a good buffet, although the cooked breakfast options were quite pricey - £26 for a full english breakfast!  The location is great - walking distance to Covent Garden and all the bars and restaurants there.  We were staying for a friend's birthday and walking back from the party at 2am rather than having to grab a cab was very useful!  Also ideally placed for  a more relaxed wander around Bloomsbury on Sunday morning.  I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again in the future.",5,2016,03,08
115,Excellent stay,"My Wife and I stayed in the hotel for one night over the weekend as it was my Wife,s 40th and we were going to see a show. Hotel staff were very friendly on arrival and Moritz checked us in and also asked if we would like a hot towel as it was very cold outside, which was a nice touch. The room that we stayed in on the 7th floor was smaller than expected but was to a very high standard with all the normal amenities that you would expect. Breakfast in the morning was absolutely excellent. We both had the full English, which at £26 each is steep, but ours was included in our weekend break. Best one I have had in years. We were checked out by Adriana who again was very polite and charming. It has a perfect location for the West End and we would definitely stay there again. Thank you to all at the Hotel.",5,2016,03,07
115,Mother's Day Lunch on the beautiful new Landseer terrace,My husband and daughter surprised me with a beautiful lunch on the new terrace area at the Bloomsbury Hotel. It was a wonderful experience of both the ambient and service by the staff was exceptional. The food was of the highest quality and the presentation was delightful. It is a must visit and children are most welcome and the staff made my daughter feel very speacial. A most wonderful experience and a a delightful day with a big thank you to all the staff at the hotel who made it extra special.,5,2016,03,06
115,Favourite place to stay in London,"This hotel is everything we require and desire!! The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food is excellent and the newly 'enclosed' terrace is fabulous. We were able to have lunch outside whilst still being warm and dry. 
I booked a superior room this time and it was worth the little extra for a bigger room and bed. 
We return again in 6 weeks time!!",5,2016,03,06
115,exceeded expectations,"Excellent hotel for personal welcome, sense of history, location, comfort and elegance. We were able to access the British Museum, shopping and theatreland equally well. The hot towel welcome and the provision of bottled water for the journey home much appreciated.  Extensive breakfast menu thoroughly enjoyed.
",5,2016,03,06
115,"Nice people, lovely rooms, good location","The Bloomsbury is a lovely hotel in a very nice location. The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. I stayed for two weeks on a business trip and had two different rooms, the rooms are nice, clean and comfortable. The small fitness center in the basement is good for low key workouts. There is also a YMCA across the street. This is within walking distance of some great places for healthy breakfast, quick meals, easy access to train. Highly recommended. ",5,2016,03,04
115,Elegence and atmosphere,"The room had everything I expected, in a smaller space than I expected, but there were plenty of little touches, and the bars, and reception rooms downstairs more than made up for for this. 

The bar, of an evening, had an excellent atmosphere, and the terrace areas looked very good, too. Although, it was a bit too cold for them when I was there.

The location is good, especially if you're visiting the Dominion Theatre, and close to a tube station and shops. ",4,2016,03,04
115,As expected!,Based on all the previous reviews I expected to love it and I did.   Great location. Just a short walk to the Tube if you need it. Beautiful hotel. Comfortable rooms. Modern. Would definately go back. Thanks guys!,5,2016,03,02
115,Excellent Experience,"Dined here for a pre theater meal, very friendly  helpful staff, food was well presented, served at correct temperature and all very tasty.  Bar area has nice atmosphere with good choice of cocktails.
Very clean areas and well decorated, plenty of seating available.",5,2016,03,02
115,Fantastic stay,"Booked for a night away in London.  Wanted something close to Covent Garden and this was ideal.  Check in and service outstanding.  Breakfast wonderful. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would like to stay again.
      
      ",5,2016,03,02
115,Really lovely hotel,"We stayed at The Bloomsbury Hotel on Saturday night, it's a really beautiful and grand hotel from the outside and inside it continues to ooze elegance and style. The hotel is immaculate, the quality and standards are exceptional and it has a true luxury feel.

All staff we encountered were friendly and helpful, the hotel has a really lovely feel about it. I would definitely recommend!",5,2016,02,29
115,quality hotel in the heart of london,"Only stayed the one night on a theatre visit but couldn't fault the The Bloomsbury one bit, good friendly  staff, nothing was too much trouble and genuinely seem interested in making sure you had a good stay. We decided to go for there pre-theatre dinner which i have to say was excellent and on par with a lot of top restaurants we've eaten at.  After the theatre we went back to the bar and the bar man was great very friendly even when i asked him for a cocktail not on his list it was no problem and nothing was too much trouble.

Got up to the room and one of the reception staff had hand written a note hoping we had enjoyed the show and left us a show program :-)

All in all an excellent stay in a really good hotel, will definitely be going back

Thanks to everyone :-)",5,2016,02,28
115,Wonderful stay at The Bloomsbury,"I find it very hard to fault this hotel. Lovely room (reasonably spacious, very comfortable and well equipped), very efficient and friendly staff and the interior of the hotel looks magnificent. Especially at night, when the lighting is very atmoshperic and ambient. The Garden Terrace is fantastic. 

I will certainly return!",5,2016,02,27
115,Mom and daughter having fun,"Wonderful location , welcome stuff , designed, good smell, wonderful room, Very good restaurant , it was the most perfect London stay  ever been mostly I am going to come again and recomend for friends",5,2016,02,26
115,An absolute gem,"Great location as minutes from a great car park under the YMCA (pre book via Just Park at a big saving) and Tottenham Court Rd ttube is minutes away with easy walking to the British Museum, Covent Garden and Soho/Fitzrovia ",5,2016,02,26
115,Tiny rooms with no view!,"I was staying in a single room at the top floor. The room was tiny as a shoe box and I felt like staying in a hostel. It was. There was a window, which was impossible to open with a view on a wall! 
I can't judge the double rooms, maybe they are more spacious, but avoid staying in a single!",1,2016,02,24
115,A Superb choice,"I serlected the Bloomsbudy for a short vacation in London. It is not cheap (nothing good in London is cheap) but it was worth all the expense. On arruvak we got a rather noisy room /due to some piping or plumbing). As I had upgraded ny room this should not have happened. But staff member ""ADRIANA"" solved the problem in minutes and gave os an even better room (and no noise). ADRIANA's superb service characterises everything in this historically bult and beautiful hotel. The breakfast is superb as is the interior decorations, the ambience and the unbeatable location 1 minute from the British Museum and the Tottenham Court Rd. Tube station.
Highly recommended without reservation!",5,2016,02,23
115,This place knows what they're doing,"I stayed here for three nights recently with my wife. A few days before we left, I received an email from the hotel asking what they could do to make our stay enjoyable. I figured that it was just marketing but this place really knows what they're doing. 

We arrived and were upgraded to a larger room which was quite appreciated. Every staff member we saw was courteous and kind. The room was extremely comfortable. The bed was perfect to sleep in and we just felt a sense of warmth and safety there. 

Location couldn't be beat...right in Bloomsbury and a 3 minute walk to Soho. We had such an excellent stay, we decided to try their Washington DC hotel since we'll be there this weekend.",5,2016,02,23
115,Short City Break,"We stayed at The Bloomsbury for a mid-week city break and from the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel welcome and relaxed. The decor in the hotel was classic, crisp and well-maintained. 
I am struggling to find anything negative to say about the hotel to give a balanced review, but I can't think of anything! I could say that the room was on the small side, but it was in central London, so we all have to compromise on space!
The breakfast was great, with a good choice at the buffet and I can highly recommend the Eggs Benedict.",5,2016,02,22
115,Very atmospheric and welcoming hotel,"We loved our stay at the hotel.  My favourite bit was the entrance hall which was beautifully lit at night and had a wonderful atmosphere.  Staff were very friendly and helpful. We felt at home.  We ate every evening in the restaurant and enjoyed the service, food and wine. ",5,2016,02,21
115,Fantastic hotel in a brilliant location!,"All aspects of this hotel were really great. All the staff from reception to housekeeping, waitresses/bar staff to the concierge, were all very friendly and extremely helpful. The hotel surroundings were stylish and the rooms were well furnished and comfortable. We would definitely book this hotel again and would recommend it to anyone staying in London. Thanks for a great weekend!",5,2016,02,21
115,Lovely hotel ,We have stayed here a couple of times now and was there this weekend great hotel great location our only problem this time was the room we stayed in 215  was noisy as had 2 lots of guests who were next door 2 separate days who was loud and noisy both nights so not much sleep but don't let this put u off this is a awesome hotel and with great freindly staff we paid for breakfast and it was very good nice cooked breakfast and lots of help your self food as well going back towards end of year in those hotel great location to Oxford Street and tube station only round the corner Tottenham Court Road ,5,2016,02,21
115,London stayover,"Wonderful location & superb hotel in every respect would definitely visit again. From arrival to departure was a great experience. The room was comfortable & spacious. In the evening before our return the bed was ""turned down"" with chocolates & in room breakfast menu left & the complimentary tea & coffee were replenished along with dressing gown & slippers being laid out ready for retiring.",5,2016,02,21
115,Centrally located with unrivalled service,"This is one of my favourite places to stay in London as it is close to Oxford Street and the happening places so you can just walk. If you're using the Tube, Tottenham Court road Station is a few metres away.
From the time you reserve your room online, you get the special attention from the Bloomsbury.
You can have a special pickup from Heathrow and can request for early check/in. I was arriving in the morning and was pleased to have a room ready. 
The staff are also very friendly and helpful and this what always makes the Bloomsbury feel like home away from home. 
Papers are brought to you in the morning. Breakfast is charges separately and there is a great spread from hot breakfast to healthy smoothies.
The Wifi in the hotel works very well and if you like working out, this is one of the few hotels with a gym in central London.",5,2016,02,21
115,Excellent - cannot fault,"Excellent hotel, couldn't fault our stay.  Easy to find and travel to the city locations.  
Rooms were very spacious and maintained to a high standard.  No problems at all during our stay. Staff could not be  more helpful.  Would recommend to anyone.",5,2016,02,20
115,Valentine break,"We had been given strictly tickets for Christmas, so I thought why not do a show as well. We needed somewhere close to a tube and shows. The Bloomsbury didn't disappoint, the staff, decor and room were perfect. If I had to have a gripe, it would be the breakfast service but it was busy and we were in no rush apart from that spot on and we will call again. ",5,2016,02,20
115,Great find,A great boutique hotel! Reasonable transfers arranged through the hotel. Fantastic afternoon tea at the hotel after a long trip. Terrific location. Booked directly with the hotel and got a very quiet room (not that I think you could get a noisy one as its on a quiet street..). Lots of options for family's (I made enquires). Concierge also very helpful in booking theatre tickets. Highly recommend it!. ,5,2016,02,20
115,A family outing,My wife and I wanted a venue close to theatres (to take grandchildren and their parents) that we could host a pre theatre lunch and also for my wife and I to stay overnight. We choose The Bloomsbury Hotel on line and made the request for our family lunch by telephone. We enjoyed exceptional service from check-in through to departure. Our family lunch in the newly opened Dallaway restaurant was exactly to our liking and the service very personal. We had a delightful dinner for two in the Landseer restaurant and a wonderful breakfast the next day. We stayed in a standard room which in our opinion would have been classed as deluxe in many other hotels. In summary we had a great time and every member of staff was exceptional. Thank you all and well done! We'll be back as often as we can.,5,2016,02,19
115,Afternoon Tea,"We had afternoon tea in the Lutyens Lounge at The Bloomsbury. Highly recommended, the staff could not be more helpful and accommodating.  It's a lovely hotel and a great place to relax whilst drinking tea and eating their delicious sandwiches and scones.  A welcome refuge from the bustle of Oxford Street.",5,2016,02,18
115,Luxury in London,"We spent Valentines weekend at The Bloomsbury totally gorgeous opulance.

From arrival presented with a red rose and hot towels and still water,fruit bowels in reception.
Furnishings to die for throughout with many bars and restaurants.
The service was faultless.

Our room we had upgraded to an exec and delivered on all levels even a lovely selection of postcards,magazines and extensive minibbar.
Our request for a bath and shower noted and delivered.
Breakfast was scrummy with top quality ingredients but a little steep at £26 maybe include in the exec room prices.
The hotel was very quiet and peaceful you would never guess you were in London.
Excellent base from Kings Cross and in five minutes your on Regent Street.
Luxury in London highly recommended.",5,2016,02,18
115,Elegant afternoon tea.,"I was lucky enough to be treated to afternoon tea at this lovely hotel, last Monday, before moving on to watch War Horse on stage.

We were greeted at the door and escorted to a beautifully set table within the elegant lounge. The service was personal but not intrusive and the tea itself was delightful. There was a selection of finger sandwiches, a crème brulee, freshly baked scones with jam and cream and a variety of delicious cakes and pastries. Heaven! There was also some subtle background music playing so, all in all, it was a relaxing prelude to a lovely afternoon/evening and a very special treat.

The friend who had treated us all said The Bloomsbury was one of only a few hotels that served tea in the later afternoon (our table was reserved for 5pm).",5,2016,02,17
115,Average,Not great to be honest. I was in a room that was close to where the cleaners gather and this meant it was quite noisy (room 520). The room wasn't the best. Old and dated and not as clean as expected. Dinner and breakfast were ok but again not of the standard I would expect for the cost. Reception staff were great. I didn't have to time to cause a fuss as it was a fleeting visit for business but should I really have to? I am in London every couple of weeks and probably won't stay here again. Location is excellent for shopping on Oxford St etc.,3,2016,02,16
115,Another great stay,"This hotel offers great location, great facilities and great service. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and well equipped. I would very much recommend this hotel to any one looking for a centrally located excellent hotel.",5,2016,02,16
115,A lovely weekend,"I contacted the hotel a few days before we arrived to arrange some special treats for my partner.  The hotel is lovely and the staff were very good.  We had complimentary wine and chocolates and the bed was turned down and strewn with rose petals.  Sunday morning was too short as we could have laid in bed all day, it was so comfortable.  Saturday night in the bar was pleasant although the barman was mostly on his own as his colleague had called in sick but he did a magnificent job.  The only down point was the service charge applied to be served drinks at the bar.  I'm not sure I was happy about that.  Had we been sat at a table some distance away with orders taken and served without us having to move it would have been more acceptable.  We would still stay again!",4,2016,02,16
115,Valentines weekend stay,"Stayed at the hotel previously on more than 1 occasion and always enjoy it here.  The staff are professional, polite and helpful and nothing seems to be too much trouble.  I was overcharged for flowers but this was put right immediately without fuss. The hotel is immaculate, lovely breakfast and easy to check in and out.  Will always go back on future visits to London.",4,2016,02,16
115,Excellent Staff,"Very Clean Hotel and the following members of staff were outstanding on my stay

Maria, Hussein and Ionut,   thanks for the warm welcome and I look forward to coming back.

Very good facilities and great location",5,2016,02,15
115,POSH,"It was a treat, all expenses paid weekend and this included a night at this hotel. Posh was not the word with me in jeans on arrival at this hotel. Was greeted by a very eager doorman who couldn't be more helpful if he tried. All staff were as expected very polite and very helpful but a bit above my station lol. Everywhere seemed to be perfect even the breakfast was just the right amount if you eat the toast. Cant fault the place but it comes at a cost.",4,2016,02,15
115,"Lovely hotel, lovely staff","I stayed in this hotel with some friends for 2 weeks in January, 2016 and it was extremely good.   The position is excellent being on a quietish street not far from The British Museum and Tottenham tube station.   The staff were excellent with special mention Estelita in the breakfast room.  She rembered peoples names,  how they liked their coffee and couldn't have been more pleasant and efficient.",5,2016,02,14
115,Birthday Treat,"My boyfriend took me here for my 30th birthday celebrations and we stayed for a couple of nights.
What can I say? A-maz-ing!!

Ideally situated in the heart of the theatre district, close to plenty of bars and cocktail lounges. 

The lobby has a very relaxed feel to it, with a separate seating area for afternoon tea. We chose the champagne option and everything about it was perfect, from the service, to the sandwich choices, to the freshly prepared pastries and scones. Superb!
Each time we attended the reception we were greeted by name - no idea how they managed to remember everyone but it made us feel very special. 

Our room was top notch, decor was beautiful and bed was so big and comfy!

We had breakfast each morning which was excellent. I can recommend the smoked salmon and scrambled egg. Delicious!
Fresh fruit, cereals, pastries, meats and cheeses, different juices, bread...
We had a pre-theatre dinner one evening which was very delicious. 

The bar was lovely to have a drink at in the evening and the barman was very attentive, my glass was never empty. 

Beautiful hotel with wonderful staff. I'd love to return one day. 

",5,2016,02,14
115,Lovely stay,"What a hotel. loved it great rooms great staff and can't wait return. Bought some candles from there which are great. We're can you by them from since u have bought some from u and when they run out need some more  please I you can help 

Thanks Carl Hoveman",5,2016,02,14
115,Weekend break,We booked this hotel as we apwere going to shaftsbury theatre which is a 5min walk away. From booking till we left we could not fault anything. They accommodated our request for early check in as we were seeing a matinee. After the show we went back as we had booked the restaurant for dinner. Aladdin was extremely friendly and helpful and the chef accommodated me with a starter that was not on the menu  the food was excellent and my fillet cooked medium rare to perfection.Bar tender had excellent customer service when we had pre dinner drinks. Our breakfast experience was amazing with 5 star service from Estelita and Maria. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel and we will definitely be going back.,5,2016,02,14
115,"Perfect located, Perfect staff, excellent choice","We came for a short stay and loved the location. Near Oxford Street, the SoHo and the British Museum. We walked everywhere and had a wonderful stay. 
The room is nicely decorated and very comfortable; Wifi worked great, Breakfast buffet was very much to our liking with a lot of choice and the main asset of the hotel are the staff that were very friendly, kind and helped with any request willingly, always with a smile and perfect service. We very much recommend staying at the hotel, and will be back.",5,2016,02,14
115,Bloomsbury-relaxing,"Enjoyed our stay at the Bloomsbury.  My husband celebrated his ""special"" birthday and decided after looking at lots of nice looking exterior places to stay, the interior did not compare with those at the Bloomsbury.  The room was comfortable and suited us.  There was a slight plumbing problem and when reported to the reception they did offer to move us.  The service was excellent, even though we were minus a bath towel and sugar, these were quickly replaced when reported. The concierge were really helpful and well informed of the areas amenities and transport, cannot fault the staff.",4,2016,02,13
115,"Friendly, comfortable hotel with a few rough edges","This hotel is very conveniently placed being close to Totenham Court Road and the Dominion Theatre which we were going to visit. On arrival, we were greated by a very pleasant doorman who open the door for us and showed us through to reception. The staff here were also very friendly. I was pleased to be able to check in early at around 12:00 even though the official check in isn't till 15:00.
We found the room to be not huge, but large enough to be comfortable. The bed was only 4'6"" wide, I would have preferred a 5' one and there would have been room for one, especially if they removed the footstool which took up some room. What the bed lacked in width was compensated for by it's height! I have never encountered such a high bed and my wife, being on the short side, had difficulty climbing onto it!
I did notice a slightly 'off' smell from the bed linen, it was what you get from a laundry which didn't keep it's machines clean. I stress this was only slight, and my wife didn't notice it.
Regarding the bathroom, I noticed what looked like two nasty looking black slugs in the bath, but closer examination revealed that there were just black marks where something in the past must have dropped onto the bath and chipped the enamel. So not a problem, but it just didn't look very nice.
Although there was a slightly non-slip finish to the bath I was bit concerned it would be too slippery to feel safe having a shower (from a previous fall I had once). I enquired at reception if they could provide a bath mat but they said they didn't have any but, to be fair, they did offer us another room with a walk-in shower, but I decided to keep with the room we had.
Out room's window looked out onto an atrium. This had a large tree in it, but it looked a bit shabby. Looking down, I could see a ladder which had just been left randomly on the floor. It would be much nicer if they could decorate up the atrium to make it a more pleasant outlook for rooms which don't have an outside view.
So, my overall impression of the hotel is that it comfortable with exceptionally friendly staff. It had just a few rough edges which could be improved upon.",4,2016,02,13
115,Perfect,"Stunning Hotel and every single member of staff we encountered were a credit to the Hotel, extremely helpful, polite and always with a friendly smile. The breakfast was beautiful. Can't fault anything.",5,2016,02,12
115,Eloquent and classy,"We stayed here with other couples for a birthday celebration weekend. It was a prefect choice as it was very classy and eloquent. It had a wonderful feel to the hotel, a warmth as you entered with a beautiful scent of burning candles that was fresh like a spa rather than bohemian. There was an intimate and atmospheric bar downstairs while in the entrance was a couched area to relax and close by some tables to have afternoon tea, each area a lovely place to be. The staff were very professional, helpful and friendly. We were very happy with our room, bed was very comfortable. Would definitely recommend.",5,2016,02,11
115,First Class,"I stayed at the Bloomsbury with my wife as part of a 'significant' birthday celebration. She had made all of the arrangements, including liaising with the concierge, Brian who was welcoming and on hand to advise and guide us. On arrival we had been upgraded, a birthday cake arrived in our room and a programme for the theatre show we were attending was supplied without request. The room was spacious, immaculate and comfortable. We enjoyed dinner from the pre-theatre menu on the heated terrace. The whole visit was first class.",5,2016,02,10
115,"""Excellent and perfect hotel""","This is a stunning hotel, amazing inside and the terrace outside. It is very clean and our room was perfect. The service is impeccable, Moritz from the reception was really helpful and so kind with us all the time. It is located close to the tube station and very close to the center. One of our best holidays. We will come back soon again.",5,2016,02,10
115,OK but the little details let them down,"Beautiful hotel in a great location. I can't fault the decor but it was some of the basics that let the experience down for me, considering the money. Little things included, cheap toilet paper, no bottle opener in room so I had to call reception to get one delivered, 10 mins late on my wake up call, housekeeping coming to clean my room at 8am (and walking in - but least that woke me up!)",3,2016,02,10
115,"Beautiful hotel, lovely staff, great location- would 100% recommend","We stayed here for one night and had a lovely stay. The whole experience at the hotel was great from start to finish. 

The staff were really helpful and friendly, the room was fantastic and the breakfast in the morning had a great choice either from the fresh buffet or other meals off the menu. The hotel is very centrally located and it's a short walk to Holbourn or Tottenham Court Road underground stations.

We also unfortunately had to spend most of the night in hospital so the hotel staff were really lovely and allowed us to have a late check out so that we could catch up on sleep.

Will definitely be staying here again, and would recommend the hotel to friends and family.",5,2016,02,10
115,Fun weekend in London,"Very nice hotel.  Nice rooms - ours was a bit small but fine for one night in town.  Good breakfast, very good staff.  Door staff in particular are excellent.
Can't beat the location as you are smack bang in the middle of town.  Was still nice and quiet at night though!
Will be staying again.",5,2016,02,10
115,Great location,"Stayed here for a city break. Fab location across the road from Euston station 
Room small but cozy . Breakfast ( continental within the price of the room ) lots a choice with a hot breakfast menu for a extra £6 . Would stay here again ",4,2016,02,09
115,excellent hotel in great location,"This is a lovely wee hotel, beautifully finished in a grade 2 listed building.  This means lots of corridors and doors and slightly odd shaped bedroom ceilings which all adds to the character.   The bedroom was decorated in a lovely style, and was very quiet.  But if you like fresh air in the bedroom at night be aware that the windows don't open.  As for food and drink, the breakfast was superb, top notch.  The quick meal we had in the restaurant before we went to the show was ok but nothing to rave about(my husband had the pre theatre 2 course and I just had a main).   We came back to the hotel bar on the second night with friends after dinner in the Ivy Market Grill and found it cosy but dear - and while that's hotel bars in general - I did find £12.50 for a glass of wine a little excessive.",4,2016,02,09
115,Great location for everything !,"Ive stayed here once before and ive been very happy indeed,great location as your just around the corner from the  Tube station and straight on the top of Oxford street by Centre Point (Landmark) We arrived early and were very lucky to have a room straight away ,very good service all round and will stay again very soon .",5,2016,02,09
115,Hotel Bloomsbury ,Absolutely fantastic time spent here. The whole staff were very helpful and friendly and welcoming. The service was excellent the room was second to none. Everything you needed was in there. Can't wait to visit again. What a hotel. Would recommend it to anyone. Thanks Bloomsbury for a great hotel experiance,5,2016,02,08
115,Amazing Stay!,"Stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel for a weekend break with my boyfriend. The hotel is located in a great place (2 minutes away from the British Museum). The hotel itself has lovely décor and very friendly staff. Their service is outstanding, specially from the concierge who helped us plan our days and booked us in a wonderful tour and restaurant. Special mention to Brian who always greets us by our name which I think gives the whole experience a personal touch. I personally recommend this hotel and will certainly return.",5,2016,02,08
115,"Friendly, attentive staff and an excellent breakfast.",We booked a standard double room for a night out in London. The room was very comfortable and we enjoyed the coffee maker! The staff were all friendly and helpful. Breakfast was included and it was excellent with a wide choice. Fresh orange juice in individual bottles and kept on ice was another detail that made for a delicious start to the day. Thanks!,5,2016,02,08
115,Definitely stay there again.,"Had a lovely two night stay, when we first arrived the lady on reception asked why we were staying, I told her it was my birthday. A few minutes after getting to our room, a tray with fresh fruit and two glasses of champagne arrived along with a birthday card. A really nice touch. We ate in the restaurant on the first night, fantastic food, we had sea bream and steak. Had breakfast on our final morning, again, great service and great food. All the staff at the hotel are eager to please and are very friendly. The young lady who works in the bar (I think she is from Leeds) was especially helpful. The rooms are on the small side but extremely comfortable, very clean, good pillows and duvet. Great shower and with underfloor heating what more could you ask for? The hotel is in a great location, we went to her majesty's theatre, about a 15 minute walk. Loads of restaurants and bars on the door step. Would stay here again next time we go to London.",5,2016,02,07
115,Above and beyond expectations,"We had an unplanned and extended stay in London following an accident in Central London's Oxford Street which left my dear friend with a broken ankle and wheelchair needs.  The entire team at the Bloomsbury were so helpful and moved us to wheelchair-accessible room and ensured that we had everything we needed to accommodate the new and unfortunate set of circumstances.  

Every single member of the Bloomsbury team knew our situation and would greet us by name.  They were all apprised of our situation and were always on hand to help.  Obviously, our movements were extraordinarily slow and they never looked hurried or inconvenienced -- quite the opposite, actually.  The doormen and concierge team were so helpful, the front desk and the guest relations team were sublime and the housekeeping staff could not have been any more helpful and delightful.  We also had the pleasure of meeting the General Manager and the CEO -- both of whom were so delightful and engaging -- they also knew the situation and only wanted to be of assistance. 

The food at the Bloomsbury is delicious and we had the pleasure of being one of the first customers to their new Terrace -- the decor and amenities are so comfortable and the service is excellent. 

There are a number of 4-5* hotels in London -- I cannot imagine any others would have gone the extra mile that the Bloomsbury did.  It was like being in a resort with warmth and comfort at every turn.  

Don't bother staying anywhere else in London -- this is the place.  You will not be disappointed.",5,2016,02,07
115,Rooms are small but location is ideal and overall service is very good,"Good quality hotel situated in an ideal location, there is actually a theater just round the corner and the well known Lobster House is just opposite it (next to the 24/7 dinner, we nearly missed it make sure you don't).  
The staff were extremely helpful during our stay except for one rather abrasive eastern European lady who works at the front desk.  She seemed a little aggressive and repeatedly tried to get us to book breakfast at the hotel even though I had made it clear since our arrival that we wanted to go the the Breakfast Club.
The rooms were also rather small especially considering the daily rate but I guess that is standard for central London.
I must recommend this place though as the service was great in general, beds comfortable and the rooms were always well kept.",4,2016,02,06
115,Very noisy stay,First room was noisy so moved to another room where we experienced drilling and hammering til 7pm then to top it all fire alarm set off at 6.25 am.  Seems managers do no know rooms in hotel. Not happy.,3,2016,02,06
115,Service and comfort,"Lovely Central London hotel. Great service, in particular from the reception (Aariana take a bow), comfortable well equipped rooms and fantastic catering, with breakfast being a particular highlight (plenty of interesting smoothies available (I went for London Greens)).  

Location is fab as well - two minutes from Tottenham Court Road so easy access to the West End, City, Oxford Street - basically all of London",4,2016,02,05
115,Another superb stay.,Have stayed here several times and cannot recommend it enough. it is an oasis in the centre of London. Location is superb. My son is studying at UCL which is why I first choose the hotel. Each member of staff cannot do enough for you. I sometimes travel alone but always feel safe and relaxed in the hotel. So nice to be recognised and welcomed back as you check in at reception. Rooms are spotless and so comfortable.I cannot recommend The Bloomsbury enough. Take my advice and book a stay and experience it for yourself.,5,2016,02,04
115,Lovely stay,"Had a great stay here in the Bloomsbury. The terrace was a great place to eat and very comfortable. All the staff were helpful and friendly, especially Brian the concierge who gave me lots of information on places to go around the area.",5,2016,02,03
115,Lovely afternoon tea,"We came here for afternoon tea back in the summer and it was absolutely lovely. Despite my tea snobbery, they lived up to my standards (leaf tea, made properly and not overbrewed, with a filter that meant that once you had poured a cup or two the leaves were no longer in the water so it didn't become overbrewed) and had a great range of teas. The cakes were great, the scones were lovely and warm and the service (despite repeated and probably annoying requests for more jam and cream for the scones because we're a greedy bunch), was brilliant. The only problem was that it was so tasty that I didn't stop eating when I was full. I will be back.",5,2016,02,03
115,Birthday Treat weekend,"Welcomed very professionally on check in, all staff very polite. Great location for theatre  land, less than a ten minute walk to the Criterion. Our room was exceptionally clean and modern, on the small side but that wasn't a problem, and had a large bathroom with a fab shower. Tea and coffee in the room. We used the bar but didn't eat at the hotel. This hotel has a very interesting history and there was a little book in the room to explain, which was a nice touch.
We would stay again.",5,2016,02,02
115,Excellent stay,"We have stayed at the Bloomsbury several times and it never disappoints. This time for a long weekend from Thursday 28th Jan to Tuesday 2nd Feb. The staff are always cheerful, helpful and they smile which makes us smile. 

We ate in the new enclosed Darroway terrace restaurant one evening and one late lunch on another day. The food and wine were excellent and we would have happily paid full price but we're really pleased that there was a 50% promotion as the Darroway was newly opened. We think this is a good addition as the terrace was not really usable when we visited during previous winter months. 

The room had everything we needed. The turndown service is available which we used a couple of times.

Breakfast was a delight and Estelita and her crew looked after us superbly. 

Hopefully we will be back sometime soon.",5,2016,02,02
115,I just returned home to the Bloomsbury Hotel,I stay here every time I visit London and every time I check in I feel like I've just returned home.  Stayed here in January and will be returning again in February. The Bloomsbury really makes one feel welcome. Apart from the great location and really well appointed rooms (all have Nespresso machines and a panel of sockets for every device imaginable) the standout feature is the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff. Attention to detail is obvious.  Go see Joel in the Landseer Bar for an exceptionally comfortable warm friendly drink an a cold winter evening.,5,2016,01,31
115,The best hotel.,"We were there last week for 6 nights.
The room was superb, the cleanest room we ever had, friendly  and helpfull staff .The location -the best.
Special thanks to the Reception Manager !!!!!
We will be back.",5,2016,01,31
115,Winter Break in London,"Hotel is very well located so as to allow you enjoy the attractions of London easily.
The décor and atmosphere of the hotel are top class. We stayed in a standard room which we felt was a little too small , on our return we will select a bigger room.
Staff were excellent and service top class.
In particular go and enjoy a drink in the nice bar downstairs where Joel will look after you very well indeed.
Excellent hotel.",5,2016,01,29
115,Perfect again,"London is a madhouse, especially near Tottenham Court Station, and entering the Bloomsbury is like heaven.
The door is opened for you, you are greeted, taken to Reception, where you are made to feel that you really matter. First impressions really matter.
Our room was a standard room, nothing special, but immaculately clean, and everything that you could wish for, including Espresso coffee machine.
The bathroom could have just been built, it was so clean and tidy with no grotty corners.
A supremely comfortable bed, with top-quality linen, and room temperature thermostat to assure a good night.
Unfortunately we had to eat out, for I was pleasantly surprised by the menu prices in the restaurant, and amazed at the 50% discount offered on the food in one of the venues.
We have been there before, and would not hesitate to returm again.",5,2016,01,28
115,5/5,"Every day is an amazing day.......but what happened today has made me fall in love ......with the Bloomsbury Hotel. One great act of kindness was bestowed on me today as I was leaving the hotel after attending a meeting at the hotel.  Every staff I passed or spoke to were smiling. I was due to meet friends for a Birthday drink but it was re-arranged for another day, so whilst making my way out of the hotel to head home. I had a change of mind and decided to treat myself to a drink by myself. The relaxing atmosphere and the great jazz music playing sealed the deal. As I spoke to the staff saying I was treating myself to a drink to celebrate my Birthday, the staff sat me down. One act of kindness by 2 outstanding staff members... A glass of champagne and 2 slices of Birthday cake with a candle on it blew me away as well as the birthday sentiments I received from fellow guests.... Attention to detail and paying attention to guests is what separates an ordinary floor manager who is just there for the money and an outstanding floor manager like Aladdin who is great with people. I came with no expectations...... But I am leaving the Bloomsbury with a fantastic and lasting impression.....Aladdin for sure made my time here awesome...he is soon to get married (overheard conversation), Gintare and the lovely front of house manger called Julie all made me feel special on my specia day. I definitely will be returning to the Bloomsbury Hotel......
I decided to stay for something to eat and OMG the King Prawns in the Dalloway Terrace are to die for...Haithem and the Terrace restaurant manager ... All were fabulous. I don't want to go home...what a great day and what a great experience. Thank you all ...Barbara ",5,2016,01,27
115,"when excellence meets love , you can't ask for more ...","I have visited many hotels all over the world .I also visited other hotels in bloomsbury street . In the bloomsbury hotel  i felt a unique combination of uncompromising  excellence with so much kindness and care .Everyone of the staff tried the best. Especially Andrea Bortom that made everything in her power to make it unforgettable journey for us.Vasco,  Estelita, Antonio all did such an  effort to make us feel good, but honestly it was everywhere .As a senior manager i would love to say to the  general manager that the hotel wellbeing vision and approach was well expressed everywhere.Highly recommended. We are already waiting to return. Thank you everyone. ",5,2016,01,27
115,Quiet & Location,"When I travel for work I hope for a few things:
- Quiet rooms: Check
- Restaurant Options: Check
- Kind / caring staff: Check
The hotel is located only 5 minutes from my London based office. I did not do much sightseeing as this was a work trip. There are numerous pubs and restaurants located within walking distance of the hotel. The service team was on point, grabbing my bags before I even got out of my cab. Continental breakfast included. 
Overall, I will be back to London and plan to stay at the Bloomsbury again.",4,2016,01,27
115,Made to feel welcomed,"We stayed here recently for a special birthday. We wanted a hotel within walking distance of Shaftsbury Avenue and were not disappointed in the Bloomsbury. The staff were excellent combining professionalism with friendliness.  Top marks go to Andre the concierge who looked after us when we arrived, but every member of staff made us feel welcome.  The room was excellent, the breakfasts delicious and we also sampled the special 'Theatre' early evening menu which was great value for money.  The hotel is perfectly located with Oxford Street, Covent Garden, the British Museum, theatreland and the River all with 10-15 minutes walk.  I have no hesitation in recommending The Bloomsbury and we have every intention of returning soon.",5,2016,01,26
115,Weekend Away,Excellent throughout would not hesitate to recommend or return. From arrival to leaving staff were attentive and helpful as a party of eight we had booked 4 superior rooms and although each was a little different all were a good size. The location for all of London's big  attractions was perfect could not fault this hotel Thank you for an excellent stay.   ,5,2016,01,25
115,Ideal and value for money ,"Stayed for one night in July with my husband. 
We have stayed in most areas of London and found the location ok. Can walk to most places and tube nearby. 

Rooms were nice and spacious and good service within the hotel. We didn't use any of the facilities and the hotel was just used as a bed for the night :-)

Would stay again",4,2016,01,24
115,Lovely service and experience,"Stayed for 5 days with my 23-year-old daughter.   Wonderfully friendly staff who remembered us throughout our stay and anticipated and met every need.   The location is perfectly suited to British Museum, Bloomsbury attractions, and Oxford Street shopping.  Also a bit more modern in design than many local hotels - for us, this is appealing.  We also ate at Dalloway Terrace, one of the hotel's restaurants, which seemed to be having a soft opening - had a traditional roast chicken with stuffing that was just superb.  Service there was great, too.   We also had an afternoon tea in the lobby and were encouraged to relax and stay a while.  The friendly and attentive staff is really the stand-out here but overall it was a great experience.",5,2016,01,23
115,My home away from home,"I travel for work and pleasure to London monthly and I never stay anywhere else. The location is perfect (one block from the British Museum and SOHO) and easy walking distance to the majority of Theaters. Transportation is right at hand (one block from the Tottenham Court Tube station). The hotel is British Modern, beautiful and very, very nicely done. The food is terrific with multiple dining choices. However, the most important feature are the staff - warm, welcoming, knowledgeable and unflagging in their helpfulness. A must do.",5,2016,01,23
115,Fantastic Hotel,"We stay for one night at the hotel, whilst catching a show. The hotel was fantastic, great location.  The staff were friendly and helpful, our room was beautiful and clean,  at breakfast we were spoilt for choice.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,01,22
115,A perfect getaway,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury hotel in occasion of celebrating our engagement.
It was everything we have hoped for and more! 
The hotel is beautiful and well designed the great atmosphere and the attention to all the detail and all the little extras provided were remarkable. 
Breakfast was delicious and the hotel hosts were fantastic and welcoming.
perfect location which allowed us to easily explore the City, we will definitely be back in our next visit.
Thank you again.",5,2016,01,21
115,Comfortable stay again,"The Bloomsbury is excellent as always.   The staff and the room are better than what I expect in a good hotel  I almost feel pampered here.  The details such as the discreet shape of the milk pitcher on the breakfast table, the tasteful design of the cushions on the bed and the elegant curves of the handrail in the staircase, things here and there were joy to watch and use.  The breakfast served in this hotel is more than excellent; it is a perfection, I may be allowed to say.  I liked scramble eggs with smoked salmon on toast and on another day poached eggs on spinach, tomatoes and pine nuts.  These are what I aspire to cook at home   I had a slight feeling  of preferring tea served last year but I am not sure if they changed tea or not.  ",5,2016,01,20
115,Wonderful Stay,"We really enjoyed staying at The Bloomsbury Hotel. It is really handy to The Tube, buses etc and very close to The British Museum. 
The staff are very good and helpful, we couldn't fault them. There is a choice of restaurants here, but we found we were spoilt for choice in the close vicinity as well. Wonderful atmosphere and we felt safe and welcomed here.
Highly recommended for a stay in London.",5,2016,01,20
115,excellent stay,"A friend recommended this hotel to me for location and friendless, was not disappointed from the grand entrance with a smiling doorman,to the lovely lobby.the room was bit on the small side i booked a standard room and was on the 7th floor.
But the service from the restaurant and the concierge department was exceptional for  a busy central London hotel.5 stars for the Bloomsbury,Thank you for making my stay memorable.",5,2016,01,19
115,Standards still high,"I had stayed at the Bloomsbury a number of times before and a recent trip was well up to standard. I'm a business woman, travelling alone and the locaiton is very good for my meetings, to which I can walk.

The hotel building itself is historic, decorated to a high standard (bedrooms are very comfortable) and well situated in London. I've found the hotel's on-line advance booking to be priced very competitively. I used the Landseer bar this time for supper, the food is good and the staff were particularly pleasant and helpful. I also got a complementary cocktail as a resident, which was a good touch! There are plenty of restaurants around the hotel, at different prices. I'll use here again and happy to recommend.

",5,2016,01,19
115,Great hotel friendly staff,"I took my wife to London to see a show for her 30th Birthday. We stayed the night and The Bloomsbury did not disappoint. In fact, it excelled.

The staff were extremely polite and friendly and the room was clean and comfortable.

We had afternoon tea on the Saturday afternoon which was a delight, a very relaxed atmosphere, great selection of sandwiches and cake and the server even gave my wife an additional cake with a candle for her birthday.

After a great night's sleep we had breakfast the following morning which again was fantastic, my wife had a full English and I had eggs Benedict. There was also a selection of meets, salmon, fruit juices, bread... whatever you could think of really. We didn't need to eat again until the evening!

The location of the hotel is brilliant and I would most certainly recommend staying there.

The only reason I did not give the Bloomsbury five dots is because there is always room for improvement.

Stephen Johnson",4,2016,01,18
115,Almost there....,"The stars of this hotel, apart from superb location and decor are the concierges - helpful to a fault. The hotel are hopefully duly proud of them. The food was great and staff all lovely. 

So why 'almost there'? Just a couple of little errors that took the shine off and I would not expect from this standard of hotel. Mostly I think due to communication problems between reception and kitchen. The room was cleaned but tea/coffee and cups not replenished, and after a day's shopping we longed for a cuppa! A call to reception and someone brought a cup up...just one when I'd asked for two...another call and another trip up by kitchen staff brought the second cup, and finally a third trip to us the milk, coffee and tea! As a guest I was the one then left feeling guilty at all the running around the woman had to do; when it was a room cleaning and then communication issue. 

So wanted the visit tone 10/10 and so nearly was 🙂 ",4,2016,01,18
115,Hidden Gem,"This is how a London hotel should be. Luxurious rooms, air conditioned, quiet. 

Only slight problem in that reception rarely answered phone - took over 5 minutes and two occasions and when asked for someone to come a fix an problem in room nobody arrived.

Breakfast is good but not buffet for hot food and portions of Full English are small",4,2016,01,18
115,A taste of luxury at value for money prices,"We stayed this weekend for my mother's birthday (one with a 0).  Great service from beginning to end and a beautifully decorated and furnished hotel.  

They send a preferences form a couple of days in advance and I'd filled it in, saying it was my mother's birthday and ordering a bottle of sparkling wine.  When we arrived in the room not only was there the wine but a birthday cake as a gift, and when I came to check out they hadn't charged me for the wine but given it as a present.  I can't remember when a hotel was so generous, I'm not a regular guest but I think I will become one.

The hotel is beautiful, a lovely conversion of a 1920s building with a fascinating history.  It isn't cheap but compared to other hotels at similar prices I think it's excellent value for money.  It is luxurious and the service from staff is excellent.

All in all a memorable stay, that was exactly what I wanted to treat my mother to for this special event.",5,2016,01,17
115,Fabulous birthday stay!,"Had a wonderful stay at The Bloomsbury with my husband for my birthday weekend. Felt well and truly pampered and spilt. Gorgeous room in a gorgeous hotel. A huge contrast from the often 'clinical' feel of London hotels. Also, the candles in the foyer smell incredible!! Will be back!",5,2016,01,17
115,Amazing afternoon tea,"I found an offer for the afternoon tea and me and my partner both really enjoyed everything about it. The service was really good, scones and pastries excellent and it offered a wide selection of premium teas 
I will definitely come back",5,2016,01,16
115,"Beautiful hotel, fantastic service, great weekend","My wife Olivia and I stayed here on Friday night for Olivia's birthday. We recieved stunning service from beginning to end: our room was beautiful & a surprise cake and birthday card from The Bloomsbury team greeted us in our room. We headed out for the evening, the hotel is perfectly located for a Soho/ Covent Garden dinner. Breakfast on Saturday was excellent - Olivia tucked into the reviving fruit juices and I had the full English! A matinee on the Strand the next day was again an easy walk from the hotel. Massive thanks to the whole team at The Bloomsbury for making our weekend so special. The service is exceptional, a very friendly team & the comfiest bed in London! We'll be back again soon!",5,2016,01,16
115,Always Delivers,"It's very rarely that the pictures on a hotel website are exactly what you get, but this is always the case at the Bloomsbury. The rooms aren't massive but they are beautifully decorated and feel indulgent and cosseting. Aromatherapy Associates products give a sense that someone really cares about your stay. Bed is very comfortable and the room was very quiet and private. Hairdryer, iron and a good selection of tea/coffee facilities. Reception and bar have a modern take on 'old school' London with candles and sofas everywhere.",5,2016,01,16
115,Excellent 3 night stay in family room,"This classic, understatedly elegant, Lutyens designed hotel is staffed by very helpful, efficient, well-trained staff. Booked a family room which had a king and 2 single beds with large bathroom (bath and separate shower). Room was quiet and staff provided a mini-fridge on request. 10 minutes walk from theatres, short cab ride from Euston. Will definitely use the well-located hotel when we are visiting London again.",5,2016,01,15
115,Great Customer Service,"All of the staff at the Bloomsbury and fantastic and make it a special stay. All very polite and we received great Customer service. I have stayed at this hotel for pleasure and business. It's a great spot, hotel very clean and tidy. I would recommend it to everyone.",5,2016,01,15
115,Great hotel and quality of Service!,"Stayed there for one night and great experience as always. Great rooms, above the London standard and very friendly staff.
The gym is small but very well-equipped and the dining facilities are great for meeting with people.",5,2016,01,15
115,"Comfortable, stylish, serene","I love the Bloomsbury Hotel. I was first booked here on a business trip by an organization I was doing some work for in London, and since then I've returned a number of times. The hotel has intimacy, character and style; the lobby's a beautiful public space, glowing at night in candlelight, and the staff have an effortless way of making you feel well cared for; it's great to come in from a cool afternoon or a night out and return to the warmth
of this hotel. It's within a few blocks of the British Museum, an easy walk to terrific restaurants, several tube stations, the National Gallery,  Soho and Covent Garden. Location couldn't be more central, but the street is quiet and the hotel's an island of calm,

Breakfast is a well-stocked Euro-style buffet, and one of the best things about it is the host, Estelita, who brings a genuine warmth and sweetness to her work of launching your day. I'm not much of a morning person, but I have to say that Estelita's attentive presence and total good spirits are irresistible,",5,2016,01,14
115,Best Good Morning in London,"Want to start your day on a bright note without having to work at it.  Have a breakfast downstairs at the hotel.  A perfectly attentive, but not overbearing, hostess (ms. estelita) and staff make sure that you can awaken and fortify in a wonderfully undisturbed way.  And if you by chance find yourself next to some thoughtless and inconsiderate business people having a loud meeting at the table next to you, the staff will take care of things for you.  Trust me they did.  I look forward to seeing Estelita's smile again.",5,2016,01,14
115,New Years,Every employee at the Bloomsbury Hotel were extremely helpful and hospitable. The hotel is well kept and  You clean!! I had a great stay!  Estrellalita (I hope I spelled her name correctly) was so nice and accommodating especially when I could not come down for breakfast. ,4,2016,01,11
115,Three nights theatre break,"We  would not stay at any other hotel in this area, chosen for location but now our favourite for staff friendliness, help and efficiency.  Room of a very high standard and the continental  breakfast so beautifully displayed - all that we could desire before a full-on day in the capital.",5,2016,01,11
115,lovely room in a great location,The hotel was great and the breakfast was very nice. We were sent an email before our visit to choose preferences such as if we wanted a room with a bath etc which was helpful. Didn't eat or drink at the hotel except breakfast. Both of us had a full English which was very good along with the buffet. The location was great just off Oxford Street but away from the hustle and bustle which is inevitable over the Christmas hopping period when we stayed. We will stay here again!,5,2016,01,11
115,Warm & Functional,Spent a night here before Christmas. Room was clean and well appointed (although the 'Nespresso' style machine didn't work) but not a very nice view of the central courtyard and air conditioning units. Location isn't that central if you're visiting London for a quick break. Staff were all brilliant so it's worth staying for them.,3,2016,01,11
115,Wonderful Hotel,"We came to London for two nights and three days.  The hotel was just perfect.    Exellent location - very central, near a tube station and within walking distance to Soho and Oxford and Regent Street.  
The room itself was very comfortable, a bit on a smaller scale but very clean and (!) with anything and everything one might wish for including a Nespresso machine. The stuff was helpful and nice and we will definitely come back to this hotel when we're in London.",5,2016,01,11
115,Amazing hotel in Bloomsbury,"Hosted private dinner in The Library in December 2015.  Andrei Maxim, Events Manager, provided excellent bespoke service.  All requests were immediately acted upon whilst organising the dinner and also on the night.  The Library is a beautiful room to host a private dinner with plenty of room to mingle.  Drinks are served by smartly  dressed staff in an unobtrusive manner.  

The night of our dinner the hotel was fully booked with various dinners and parties taking place, yet service was excellent and the food quite simply out of this world.  Absolutely exquisite.  We were all made to feel very welcome to The Bloomsbury Hotel and not hurried out of the Library at the end of the evening.  

All guests at the dinner have congratulated me for choosing such an excellent venue.  I believe the congratulations must be passed to Andrei and his team of chefs, waiting staff and the management team at the hotel for providing 5 star service to us.  

This is a wonderful hotel to enjoy 5 star treatment.  Thank you again for a wonderful evening.",5,2016,01,10
115,Classy and Luxurious ,"A 2 night stop over just before Christmas was a lovely treat here at the Bloomsbury. 

My room was quite compact, but had everything I needed.  Well located, I could walk easily to Oxford Street,  Tottenham Court Road and Carnaby Street where I was on a course.

The downstairs bar is stunning, styled in an Art Deco theme, and the cocktails are delicious. ... if a little disabling!

The staff couldn't be more helpful, and I would most certainly recommend this beautiful hotel.

115,Faded,"I was disappointed with the stay. The room was small with obvious signs of wear - scuffs in the plaster, chips in furniture, little things like the bathroom sink not draining properly. It seemed impossible to reduce the temperature as I like to sleep in a cooler room. Worst, the room was by an internal courtyard where the heating or air conditioning was located meaning a constant humming noise all night and very disturbed sleep. Feels like the place could do with a refresh as the common areas are pleasant and stylishly decorated, even if the bar and restaurant are eerily deserted. Far from the worst hotel I've stayed in but the building, location and setup mean it has the potential for much more and it compares unfavourably to more modern 4 star properties.",2,2016,01,07
115,A very comfortable and relaxed hotel in a great location,"A quiet, comfortable and relaxed experience.  The staff were helpful and discrete with just the right amount of visibility.  The room was clean, comfortable and relaxing, the service was efficient and the attention to detail superb. A great experience that my wife and I enjoyed very much.",5,2016,01,06
115,A Perfect Stay,"Hospitality faultless, very friendly and polite staff. The most idilic, stunning and beautiful rooms and we both just loved the stay. 

The location is perfect for shopping and visiting the fantastic sites of London.

Would return without any hesitation.",5,2016,01,05
115,New Fav Hotel,"Stayed hear for a party in mid December, they couldn't do enough, from holding doors to even ordering me flowers. Everything I asked was no trouble for them.
VQ24 is only over the road from the hotel so if you can't sleep due to jet lag or land in London in the early hours, you can always grab some good food.
5 minutes walk to Oxford St, round the corner form the Dominion Theatre.
Also, I'v resonantly found out they are big supporters of Help For Heroes which I think is a great thing to do.",5,2016,01,05
115,great location and beautiful hotel,"really enjoyed our stay even though it was only 1 night. the room was very comfortable, and had everything you needed for tea service and a nice bath to relax. was also close for shopping and we were able to leave our bags while we went out for the day.",5,2016,01,05
115,Perfect!,"My husband and I visited for 3 nights between christmas and new year and it was a perfect stay. The room was ready when we checked in at 10am which was great as we had had an early start and needed to freshen up. I was celebrating a birthday and they kindly sent a cake and card to the room which we really appreciated. The rooms are very comfortable and well equipped....air con, digital tv channels including sky sports, very comfortable bed, great shower and excellent toiletries provided. We did not have breakfast here as we wanted to explore the surrounding area. Salt and Pepper cafe around the corner does a great breakfast and is well priced. The hotels location is excellent and you can easily walk to the tube station. We wanted to explore on foot and walked to covent garden, soho, Leicester square, oxford circus, Westminster etc from the hotel. Would highly recommend this hotel and we will no doubt return soon. ",5,2016,01,04
115,Classic Design and Classy Hotel,"The hotel is ideally placed for all central London attractions and travel connections . 
I cannot fault any part of my stay , excellent service from all the staff . Food and wines selection second to none . classically designed and very tasteful hotel from top to bottom with spacious bedrooms very clean,

Loved the whole experience . Thanks to you all .",5,2016,01,04
115,Fabulous,"Visited here on one night during our stay in London. We were staying nearby and it caught our eye walking past. Beautiful dimly lit hotel with Christmas lights and trees throughout. Restaurant was exquisite although quiet for New Years Night. Staff were extremely friendly and the food was delicious. Service was excellent and my gluten free requirement was attended to without any issues. Moved to the bar for a drink afterwards, again dimly lit, fabulous leather seats, very romantic.",5,2016,01,04
115,2nd stay,"We enjoyed our first visit to London in May of 2014 so much, we came back with our kids in Oct 2015. Because we liked this hotel so much the first time and liked the location, we  booked it again. Unfortunately, there was a mixup and the two connecting rooms we reserved were not actually connected. With two small children, this didn't work for us.

After some discussion with the manager, we were moved to a family suite that worked ok for us. Unfortunately, it was stressful and painful to get to that point!

Rooms are very nice and very clean. Also, when we booked through a travel agent, breakfast was included. And it is DELICIOUS!",4,2016,01,03
115,"two short stays, one conclusion: highly reccomended !","Just two stays of one night each but enough to be able to say that this is the kind of hotel that everybody is dreaming of. And don't imagine that it's a five star palace with gold and diamonds everywhere ! It's rather discrete but the overall feeling: fabulous ! Everything starts with the staff: they seem to be there to make you feel like the king of the world :) And 'they make this feel like it's natural, like they find pleasure in pleasing you ... Don't know enough english to describe the feeling but it's great, without being obvious. Extra points for Adriana at the reception who managed to solve some logistic issues in a very efficient way. Thanks again !
For the rest: 
- room of decent size ; nice design ; everything works well, internet has good speed and is included ( good point ! )
- toiletries - not as good as I would expect from this hotel
- breakfast - excellent, wide choice and very very good quality
- position - very good but also very quiet ( for a city like London ... don't dream of a countryside farm ... but at least you don't have angry drivers under your window in the morning ) 
I would definitely come back again and also highly reccomend this property !",5,2016,01,03
115,The place to stay,Stayed here for New Years Eve. The location was perfect for central London. The staff made us feel very welcome from the moment we walked in the door. The rooms were very clean modern and well appointed. The breakfast was excellent. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. This is the place to stay on a visit to London.,5,2016,01,03
115,"Exquisite hotel, staff and convenient location","The hotel lobby is elegant, and we were greeted by a gracious doorman and the concierge.  The front desk check in was prompt and polite.  The room was ready early, much appreciated by travelers from the US with early arrivals at Heathrow.  The room was perfect -- well equipped, lush robes and slippers, a marble bath with many supplies.  Best of all, the hotel is extremely quiet and the blackout curtains helped adjust to the time difference!  There is a great restaurant (Dallaways) and a lovely outdoor (enclosed in winter) patio with lovely candlelight where we enjoyed an early dinner before theater. The hotel is located just two blocks from the British Museum, a ten-minute walk to Charing Cross and five minutes from the tube. The hotel is just four blocks from Charlotte Street, a charming area brimming with restaurants.",5,2016,01,02
115,Brilliant.,"Service, quality, location all exceptional.  The staff always welcoming including the doormen, front desk and the concierge staff, w a special commendation for Pablo for his help.  Of special note again:  the great location and accessibility.",5,2016,01,02
115,It runs in the family!,"Having stayed at The Westbury, Dublin it was only far that we gave this sister hotel a try.

From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the service was incredible. We were greeted to very friendly doormen who took our bags straight away. Then during check in we were offered mulled wine, which hit the stop! 

The room was lovely, well appointed if not on the little small side, But we were only there for a couple of nights so nothing to winge about. 

Breakfast was included in our rate and was delicious. Hot food cooked to order, whist the continental was self service. 

We tried the downstairs bar on our first night before our dinner reservations at a nearby restaurant. We obviously arrived at their most busiest time as it took a while to get served, but the cocktails were lovely and definitely worth the wait. Especially as when we checked out we found out we had bar credit to the room because we booked directly with the hotel!!! Nice little touch.

All in all a great hotel and one I would recommend to everyone. Close to the tube station and all the west end shops. we will certainly be using this hotel in the future if we need to be in this area - March I think!!",5,2016,01,02
115,Best new year,"We spent 5 days here at the new year.  The best part was Joel, the bartender,  at the Landseer Bar.  He was so very kind and friendly.  The entire staff was professional and accommodating.  Brian, at the concierge desk, was so very helpful in making reservations and recommendations.  This is not my first stay at the Bloomsbury and I would come back again and again. ",5,2016,01,01
115,"Great location, outstanding staff, small room","This small hotel in London's Blooomsbury district was originally built for the WYCA and opened in 1932. Bought in 1998 by the Jury's Doyle Hotel Group, the building was converted to a 170 bed hotel which opened in 2000. The hotel is 2 blocks from the Tottenham Court Road station on the London Underground, a 5 minute walk down Great Russell Street to the British Museum and a 15 minute walk to the theatre district in Leicester Square/Picadilly Circus. An excellent location for strolling through interesting neighborhoods, accessing public transportation, visiting museums and art galleries, enjoying excellent restaurants, shopping and then returning to a quiet hotel with friendly, attentive staff.

Following a very good meal at The Ivy and enjoying ""The Book of Mormon"" at The Prince of Wales Theatre, we returned to The Bloomsbury for cocktails in the quiet lobby on New Year's Eve and were greeted with the consistently friendly doormen. Even though the lobby bar was closed, the attentive staff brought us drinks from the downstairs bar along with snacks and then invited us downstairs to share complimentary champagne while ringing in the new year with the hotel staff and a handful of other guests while watching the extraordinary London fireworks display on a large screen television.  

The bar/restaurant manager Matthew, is outstanding, and the front desk, lobby and restaurant staff (notably Estelita) have also all been very attentive, friendly and capable. The breakfast is excellent and offers a wide range from the very healthy to a full English breakfast. If it were not for the small size of our room, reached through the meandering ""rabbit warren"" like hallways, the hotel would have received an ""excellent"" review.",4,2016,01,01
115,First class,This hotel has exceeded our expectations. The customer service of all staff was first class. They were very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were spacious and spotless with all necessary amenities. Last but by no means least I would recommend you eat at their restaurant. We had breakfast and dinner there and it was amazing. High quality food cooked to perfection with decent portion sizes. Would stay there again in a heart beat. ,5,2016,01,01
115,Check out the Landseer bar!,"I had a night out with my friends at the Landseer bar at the Bloomsbury Hotel. The bar has a great atmosphere, great food/drinks and THE best service from the bartender Joel! He's such a nice guy and makes amazing drinks. We will go there again for sure!",5,2015,12,30
115,Very Nice Stay in London,"The hotel staff at the Bloomsbury is lovely - very cordial, welcoming and warm.  Great bar area (drinks are a bit pricey).  The concierge was helpful and went the extra mile in delivering a tricky package for me (thanks Dale).

The rooms were well appointed if small (removing some of the unnecessary furniture would help!), but our bathroom shower pressure and temperature did not meet my expectations for a hotel of this caliber.",4,2015,12,30
115,Fantastic hotel!,"We stayed at The Bloomsbury Hotel for a week and it was a wonderful experience. The hotel is beautiful and the front desk staff were extremely accommodating and so nice. I'm sorry I don't remember their names, but each person we spoke with was great. I'd like to give a special Thank You to André, the Concierge, for being so kind and helpful. The hotel is in a perfect location for walking to most of the sites and very close to lots of bus stops and the tube. Staying at The Bloomsbury Hotel made our trip all the more wonderful. I highly recommend this lovely hotel!",5,2015,12,29
115,London Trip,"Our stay was wonderful -customer service was great.  Hotel was beautiful would stay again if  we return to London.  Rooms small but with all necessities.   Bed was very
comfortable- rooms dark could have better lighting.",5,2015,12,28
115,Last minute booking after no trains....,"Booked this hotel through last minute after discovering there were no trains home on Boxing day after a trip to the theatre. 
On arrival, the lady on reception couldn't have been more hospitable, she was incredibly helpful & friendly and a real credit to the hotel. I wish I'd made a note of her name but sadly I didn't.. She took the time to welcome us, advise on a twin room being more comfortable for my friend & I & even took us to the staircase to show us it was quicker to our room.

Although the room was small it was perfect  clean & grwat for our needs & the beds were incredibly comfortable both my friend & I slept so well after walking around the lights which we did easily from the central location of the hotel. 

The only thing I can say on a slightly negative point of view is that there were only 2 plug sockets. 1 for TV & the other for the kettle.. so impossible to charge phone etc whist doing both of the others.. but that is only a small negative..  Would stay again if ever needed to..
",5,2015,12,28
115,Afternoon tea,"We had afternoon tea at the lovely lobby lounge on Christmas Day, and enjoyed every second. Joao our server was incredibly kind and efficient, the food was delicious, and the whole experience was perfect - elegant but not stuffy, relaxing, cozy.",5,2015,12,27
115,Wonderful christmas break in a great hotel,"Staff  extremely polite and very helpful on arrival as we were slightly early at the hotel, our room was very comfortable with all the amenities that you wish for. The hotel was in a great location for our two days in London christmas sightseeing and we returned in the evening to an excellent evening meal and after dinner drinks on the veranda.",5,2015,12,24
115,Customer service,"Most enjoyable weekend at The Bloomsbury Hotel, great food, comfortable room, attentive and helpful staff, in particular front of house manager Sebastian and Estelita and Chris in the restaurant who made a surprise birthday lunch an unforgettable experience! Highly recommended.",5,2015,12,23
115,Joel is the best Mixologist in London ,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is uniquely personable, a perfect location with the best service in London.  It also has the best mixologist in London - Joel. Try it out - Joel can instinctively know what you need - intuitive with a smile. Join him for pre - music drinks or late night conversation - the Best Cocktail Bar in the best hotel in Central London ",5,2015,12,22
115,Impeccable Service,"From our arrival at was a bustling Friday night foyer until our departure 
after picking up our bags on Saturday afternoon the Bloomsbury 
can be summed up in two words - impeccable service.

Utilising customer service principle not found in some hotels at twice the price
the Bloomsbury proves that in some cases the old adage 'you get what
you pay for' holds fast.

Desk staff, concierge, waiting staff, even the busy guy we asked the way in 
the corridor, all were happy and oliging in their attitude to helping and
making our stay completely hassle free. 

Location is excellent for a pre-Christmas West End trip. a hop, skip & jump from 
Tottenham Court Road yet sleep quality was fabulous with no extraneous noise to #
disturb. 

Cleanliness was abundant in all areas and the room, if a tad small (this is London after all)
was immaculate with Nespresso coffee and sumptuous bathroom. Comfortable bed that lulled one off to sleep.

A keeper!",5,2015,12,22
115,Terrific hotel,"This is a very well-run establishment. The rooms are small (it's London), but very attractive. Our room also had a nice view.  The staff are efficient, but not briskly so.  They were attentive and helpful whether in hunting down a post office or a particular shop.  It was also quiet.  And the hotel lobby also is lovely. Be sure to get the package that includes the continental breakfast, which is a wonderful spread, not at all the sort of continental breakfast that American hotels offer.  Estelita and Chris, who took care of us at the restaurant's breakfast, are just wonderful.  Dinner our first night in was also delicious.  Great cocktails!",5,2015,12,22
115,Fantastic - perfect ,"From booking to checkin to lunch to the room to checkout this hotel is one that has got everything right. 

People say good customer service is not expensive ----- but still most don't get it right.  The Bloomsbury did. 

I am usually very picky but could not say anything negative about our stay. 

Thanks and well done. 

",5,2015,12,21
115,Excellent,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel as we had booked a trip to the theatre. We stayed two nights the location was perfect, and rooms very clean and comfortable. Staff are very attentive and always on hand to help. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. ",5,2015,12,21
115,Excellent London location,"Welcomed on arrival with all staff being helpful.  Our superior room was clean with all conveniences.  The TV was not used as we were unable to understand the controls, but maybe that was just not being used to a Sky system.  We used the tea and coffee in the room  and this was refreshed when we left for dinner.  There was a good selection of dishes available for breakfast with hot food ordered as required.  Unfortunately when I requested plain yogurt I was told that the sweetened caramel yoghurt was plain !",5,2015,12,20
115,Our Room made me feel like an over-pampered Battery Hen,"My last stay at this hotel was back in the days when it was owned by Jurys.  At that time it was great value for money offering very spacious and luxurious accommodation.  What a difference a credit crunch makes!

I want to be fair in this review and so I have to make it clear that it is very difficult to stay in bad accommodation when you are paying a nightly rate of nearly £250.  That said, when you are paying that kind of money you really need to come away feeling that you've had a top rate experience and I'm afraid that just did not happen for me: my previous stay had perhaps coloured my judgement.  

Our room was very well appointed but it was just too small.  My wife didn't have a bedside table to put her things on and bathroom access was cramped - yes, we are occasionally in the bathroom at the same time!   Ceiling height throughout appeared a little on the low side and this tended to exaggerate a vague feeling of claustrophobia.   There was a boutique-feel to the rooms hence my reference to being over-pampered.  Nevertheless, spelling is not a strong point at this hotel:  the gold lettering on the service box in our room, at least, spelt Stationery with an ""a""!

I found the staff at this hotel excellent throughout.  Wifi in the rooms was faster than average and the Breakfasts are very good.  Not the best hotel for disabled access but position for all things Soho and West End is first class.   The Reception area looked a little jaded.

My feeling is that their is probably better value to be found elsewhere.",3,2015,12,20
115,Perfect location. Wonderful service.,"This was our first stay here and we thoroughly enjoyed it. For a London hotel in a prime location we could not fault it. The staff are courteous, friendly and always helpful.

Will definately come back again.",5,2015,12,20
115,Afternoon Tea a delight,We enjoyed a Festive Afternoon tea at the Bloomsbury Lounge. The food was faultless and the surroundings were delightful. Special thanks to the kind and attentive service of Jonò. Thoroughly recommended.,4,2015,12,20
115,2nd time around,"I was not as satisfied this time as my  last a year ago, mainly because my requests were not fulfilled. But after day 1, everything was fine. The staff was excellent and friendly. I learned from last year that the continetal breakfast is more than enough. Last year I paid for the full, hot breakfast, and couldn't eat all that food. The concierges, as last year, were very helpful.",4,2015,12,18
115,absolutely worth the money,"Yes, staying at The Bloomsbury is quite pricy, but it is worth the money. Felt very comfortable from the first second onwards, nice welcome and check in experience, room was quite nice, too. Maybe a bit warm, but AC is easy to handle, so no big deal. I didn't have breakfast at the hotel, but Starbucks and Nero right around the corner... Even with the construction work that is going on around the underground station, it is only a 2 minutes walk to the hotel. We had a buffet lunch in the hotel's restaurant which was lovely, too! Might consider coming back when on holidays in London, this time, it was for business. We used the meeting service which was also a very pleasant experience - nice catering and technical set up of the meeting room!",5,2015,12,18
115,"Disappointing, at best....","After reading the many glowing reviews and looking through pictures of this property on TA, we were very disappointed.  We did not find the staff to be friendly nor helpful, especially the concierge staff (which we will get to later in this review).  
We booked a Queen Superior room and believe our dreary & dingy attic room was likely a Standard Room, especially since the mattress was too large for the headboard.  Our thoughts are that because we checked in around midnight, we got what was left after anyone else may have received an upgrade.  Our room was not what we had expected based on the TA and website pictures.  We didn't bother to mention this to the hotel staff, as the hotel was completely booked during our stay, so it wasn't as if they could move us to another room.  
The carpet and walls in the room could use a good cleaning.  Never have we seen anything like this in a hotel.  The bathroom was somewhat questionable as well.  Each time we headed for the elevator or arrived back to our floor, we found trays full of dirty room service dishes on a nearby table.  Apparently guests had grown tired of tripping over their trays on the way out of their rooms.  After a while, we had to laugh and by the 3rd day of 4 nights, I began taking pictures and joked that we would make a Dirty Tray album for the Bloomsbury.  We're no longer laughing about this, especially after the poor concierge service, mainly upon check out.  
The day of check out, we were advised that the nearby tube station was closed and the closest or best station would be Oxford Circus.  While that was fine for us when still in London for the day, it would've been too far of a walk for us later as we were heading to St. Pancras Station.  One concierge advised us to take our luggage (10 days worth for two people) around the corner to the street that runs behind the hotel, where we could easily catch a bus.  One of us asked him where on that street we could catch that bus and he replied that the buses pick up anywhere.  Apparently this is not so.  We hauled our luggage and carry-on bags over bumpy and cobble stone sidewalks, walking all along this street, both sides, on what seemed to be the windiest day in London.  We could not find the bus going to St Pancras, nor could any of the shop-keepers tell us where to find this bus.  I don't believe it existed.  Forty-five minutes later, we found ourselves back at the hotel- a bit frazzled, windblown, and tired -looking for someone to assist us.  We explained to one concierge what had happened and he said that a taxi would be quicker and less expensive, though we are not certain why the other concierge didn't advise us of this, as we would've gladly taken one.  That concierge went on to blame the other concierge for all of the problems we had been having during the trip, which didn't seem very professional.  He then called for a taxi to take us to St. Pancras, though when the driver dropped us off, it was at Kings Crossing, so he had to drive back around.  The driver advised us that the concierge told him we were going to Kings Crossing.  *eye roll*  We must've spent an extra 5 pounds in cab fare waiting in traffic to get to the wrong station and then back, in addition to more time lost.  
Each time we entered/exited the hotel, there was no one to help us with luggage and we continuously saw this happening with other guests.  Sure, once guest had hauled their heavy luggage up the outdoor stairs and then into the hotel, it seemed that a doorman or concierge magically appeared to assist.  A bit late, if you ask us.  
We would not recommend this hotel, nor will we stay here again.  There are plenty of hotels in London and we will look elsewhere when in London again.",2,2015,12,17
115,Excellent stay ,"We had a great stay at the Bloomsbury. 
Our room was perfect, quiet and spacious, and the hotel staff was nice and helpful at all times from room service to breakfast. Not the least was the comfortable lobby with a nice Christmas atmosphere. Best hotel we have had In London for years.",5,2015,12,17
115,Super break in excellent hotel,"Short break in this excellent hotel . Lovely comfortable room, all facilities we could possibly need , with efficient courteous staff. Nothing was too much trouble. Excellent food in their main restaurant, breakfast was superb,as was the meal in the restaurant  on the terrace. Cocktail lounge looked lovely too, and will definitely stay there again when in London, as was so central. Excellent hotel all round.",5,2015,12,16
115,"Location, location, location","What a great location for a stay in central London. Good classy hotel, rooms well appointed and clean. Restaurant is ok only. Service is good but food quite average. They do have meeting rooms and the library is good. The only minor thing is the apparent lack of toilets. ",4,2015,12,16
115,Great location & staff,"This hotel is located very handily just of Tottenham Court Road so within easy walking distance of Convent Garden, Soho, Oxford Street etc.

Like other Doyle Hotels we've stayed in the hotel staff were exceptional - very polite and helpful.

The room was a good sized, clean with a super comfy bed.

Breakfast was cooked to order from a wide choice and delicious with a large selection of fruits, pastries etc also available.

Overall - highly recommended!",5,2015,12,16
115,Fabulous,"I booked this hotel for a treat for my partner's birthday. We were both delighted with the experience.
The staff were welcoming, and the room and facilities all as expected in a four star hotel.
The staff in the Landseer restaurant were all extremely pleasant, Matthew in the terrace bar was particularly helpful and attentive. Can not fault the food or service. Top marks for the understated birthday treat from the chef too. 
We would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again when we want a little extra luxury. Good value at the price.",5,2015,12,15
115,Terrible one-night stay but management did come through,"Very disappointed in this hotel. Here's why:

- Nobody was there to help us carry our luggage up the stairs.

- Some of the toiletries in the bathroom were half-full.

- There was a mouse in the Landseer bar. It ran from the bar to our banquette. When we alerted the bartender, he did not seem unduly concerned.

- Room service food was left on the lobby table of the 8th floor. It was there when we checked in at 1 p.m. and still there when we checked out the next morning at 9:30 a.m. 

- We had put the ""do not disturb"" sign on our door when we went out for dinner. When we returned, the bed was turned down and the sign was placed on our bed. Our privacy was breached.

- One of the two bartenders had no clue what he was doing. We asked him to make us a Hot Toddy (on the bar menu). He said he couldn't do it. Then he asked us to wait 15 minutes while he figured it out. He finally came back with some makeshift drink that wasn't even close to what was on the menu. I heard him arguing with another guest about a drink, saying he didn't know how to make it. While this may seem like a ""first-world"" problem, it is not professional and I expected better.

- The morning we were checking out, I was in the shower and the water stopped running. There was no water running in the sink either. Luckily, I had my own bottled water (none provided by the hotel) and was able to rinse myself off (sort of) and brush my teeth. When we called the front desk to complain, the response was ambivalent. They did offer us a new room with a working shower, but we were checking out in half an hour to catch an international flight. We were given no explanation why there was no water.

- When we were leaving, the doorman just stood there and didn't help us load our luggage into the taxi.
 
- It was tempting to rate this hotel zero or one star because of the above but when I complained to the management, they were very good about working with us to refund our full night's stay and they offered to put us up any time for another night's visit (which I won't be accepting because I don't like the fuss and expect things to go right the first time).",2,2015,12,15
115,"Excellent location, friendly and helpful staff, highly recommendable","I chose it for the third time around for a pre-Xmas trip to London. The vicinity of the British Museum was a major pro, along with the 2 minute walking distance from the revamped Tottenham Court Underground Station. Some friends of mine were arriving very late at night, with no reservation, and the wonderfully kind and helpful staff managed to solve the problem after midnight and accommodate my friends for two nights, despite the full occupancy at a time when several Xmas parties were being held at the hotel and people kept on asking for a room on the spot. ",5,2015,12,14
115,Trip to London,"We arrived at The Bloomsbury Hotel London. We were met by the Concierge, who immediately took our luggage. We were very early, but we're checked in within 5 minutes. All the Xmas decorations & trees were up & the place looked so welcoming. Our luggage was delivered to our room a few minutes later. We were just unpacking when someone from customer relations arrived with two glasses of Champagne. The room was lovely, spotless clean as was the bathroom. There were robes, slippers & toiletries. The hotel is 2 minutes from Tottenham Court tube station. One minute from the Dominion Theatre. So it is very easy to get around. When we arrived back from our first day out we had scones, clotted cream & jam waiting for us. Next day was freshly baked mince pies. We had made a dinner reservation. Unfortunately we were held up and came back an hour later. The Concierge said there was no problem. We had a table in 5 minutes. All in all our stay at The Bloomsbury was excellent. The only down side was having to leave. I would go back tomorrow. Thank you to everyone there.",5,2015,12,12
115,Highly recommended ,"This is my second time staying at the Bloomsbury hotel. Love it there and will now make it my go to for when I'm
in London! The staff are so wonderful and helpful. The building is beautiful. It's so centrally located, which makes it very easily to see all the sites. I highly recommend it. ",5,2015,12,12
115,Lovely retreat moments from everything,"Service was excellent from the moment I walked up the front steps, where I was greeted by the helpful and welcoming concierge, to those assisting me at check-in and waiting staff. The recently opened Dalloway Terrace is delightful and the staff really do go out of their way to build rapport and make your stay a 5* and memorable experience. I would recommend to anyone looking for a central base with a touch of class before Christmas shopping, Theatre trips, etc. Overall a well managed hotel and I'd definitely stay again/recommend to friends/family/colleagues.",5,2015,12,11
115,Dinner and drinks,"I recently got together a group of friends to celebrate an engagement and chose the Bloomsbury mainly due to location.

We found that the service was outstanding, the staff being very impressive, and the quality of food and drink (especially good cocktails) was first rate. 

Will definitely go back and have already recommended to some friends.

115,Amazing Hotel,"My wife and I recently stayed in one of the suites at this hotel and we had a wonderful stay, the building in beautiful and is situated in a fantastic spot for visiting London, with Oxford street being just a two minute stroll from the front door. 

The staff were exceptional, really friendly and nothing was too much trouble, in fact, as my wife had mentioned that it was our anniversary we had some chocolate covered strawberries delivered to the room out of the blue (and FOC), which was a really nice touch. 

The room was amazing, huge, with a huge bathroom, lovely roll top bath and walk in rain shower, fantastic big sumptuous bed and lovely lounge area, to have so much space right in the heart of London was a real treat, and it really felt luxurious. All of the corridors and lift areas etc were perfectly kept and the décor is spot on throughout the building.  

The breakfast was also very good indeed, the service was great (particularly by Chris who was very friendly) with a lovely selection on the buffet and hot breakfast cooked perfectly to order. 

All in, an absolutely perfect stay, we stay in good hotels quite a bit but this one has set the bench mark, while not particularly cheap it certainly felt like we got good value for money, and when we're in London next we'll be back without doubt. 

Thanks for a fantastic couple of days!",5,2015,12,10
115,Loved it! ,"Had a lovely stay at the Bloomsbury, we came down to London for a special occasion and the hotel staff we great throughout. Rooms are well maintained and very cosy (not huge but didn't matter), we enjoyed drinks at the hotel bar and food at breakfast and on the all day menu. Brian in the lobby was  particularly helpful and friendly, couldn't do enough for us! Had a great stay will definitely be back next time I'm in London! ",5,2015,12,10
115,Central location,"we picked the hotel because of its central location as we enjoy the ability to just walk around and reach places without having to wait for the bus or the underground, and it worked out well. It is very close to the British Museum, Trafalgar Square, and the various theaters and Covent Garden. Even shopping is close by.
Our room was nice and clean, and we enjoyed the breakfast next door. Staff was friendly and helpful.",4,2015,12,09
115,Great location,"We regularly stay at the Bloomsbury during the first weekend in December because it coincides with an annual conference I attend in London.  This year we stayed for 4 nights and booked not only for ourselves but also our children for 2 nights so the cost of 3 rooms for the weekend was, as you can imagine, astronomical.  To get over the pain my wife and I upgraded our room and it was the best one we have had yet, even though it looked into the inner courtyard.  The bed was enormous and comfortable.  The only niggles were (i)  the shower was slow to drain and flooded the floor outside if precautions were not taken (ii) a service charge was automatically added to our bar bill each night and when you are already paying £11 for a glass of single malt that seems to me to be a bit OTT - I would (and did) tip anyway.  Having said that we like the Bloomsbury very much and it is in a brilliant location for shopping, nightlife and museums so will no doubt stay again next year.",4,2015,12,09
115,Enjoyable but watch the costs,"We stayed at the hotel when we visited for a theatre break and found the staff very helpful and polite.
The room was of a lovely standard but hot even when the heating was turned off. We called to check that breakfast was in the package we bought and we were told yes, went to the restaurant and were told we needed to pay but we did not get charged as the waiter sorted it out for us.
We did find the costs in the bar a high cost and service charge is on everything so be aware of these extra charges.
Would we stay again maybe but many other hotels are worth the money and a lot better value.",4,2015,12,08
115,Perfect location and great selection in the bar,"Great service and even better location (30 seconds walk from Oxford Street). Lobby was remarkable with the big christmas tree and its spectacular interior. Nice and quite bar with lovely drinks and prices. They also offer a fully functioning gym. All in all, a perfect place to stay when in London.",5,2015,12,08
115,Fantastic!,"I stayed here for a few nights, and the service was excellent - the room was nice too. Also, it was located right next to Oxford Street, so I easily enjoyed everything Londons has to offer. I will definitely be back!!",5,2015,12,08
115,Check-in staff,"Dear managers of the Bloomsbury hotel.

We are frequent visitors to London and we always choose your hotel for its superb location and your facilities.

The other day, after a not very nice flight to London and being ripped-off by a taxi driver, we arrived feeling a bit down, but we were pleasantly rewarded by free cocktails by Marlene, one of the members of your welcome desk, who kindly wanted to offer to us a compensation for our misfortunate trip.

We really appreciate how thoughful that was, and how kind Marlene was in trying to make our stay a bit nicer.

Thanks again and keep on being that attentive, we will keep on choosing your hotel over and over again.",5,2015,12,08
115,Excellent Stay,"My husband and I have just returned from a weekend stay at The Bloomsbury. It was our first time at this hotel and have to stay we thoroughly enjoyed it.
We stayed in a superior room, although quite compact it was comparable with London standards in terms of size, the room was very comfortable with all the mod cons you'd expect.
I thought the service was every bit as good as several 5* hotels I've stayed in throughout the capital.
We were on a Bed & Breakfast basis and thought Breakfast was excellent, service was very efficient and I particularly liked that the hot food and toast was brought to your table rather than having to queue for it as it was meant the cooked breakfasts were hot.
The location was very handy for Covent Garden and Soho which was our main reason for picking this hotel as we had planned visits to Ronnie Scotts and The Savoy. The hotel was set off a side street so was fairly quiet, however Oxford Street was only a few minutes walk. If I'm being honest the surrounding area didn't blow us away and I prefer to be around Mayfair, Knightsbridge or Hyde Park purely as its a little more peaceful and upmarket but if you're looking for a central location you cannot go wrong with this hotel.
My only minor criticisms were that the shower in the bathroom wasn't great - it had very little water pressure and I resorted to having baths in the evening as there was hardly any water coming out of the shower. Also the public areas and corridors were really warm (and I'm always cold!) and were quite stifling. These are only very small niggles though.

Overall an excellent stay and we are thinking about trying one of the other hotels in the same chain.

",5,2015,12,08
115,Little thoughts that make a difference,"When the receptionist found out that we were taking our Grandson Harry to see Elf they produce a Programme for him. On returning to our room after the show a message had been written on the mirror to Harry hoping that he had enjoyed the show and wishing him a merry Christmas , also they had left a sticker book on his bed. Very nice touch indeed. The room was excellent as were the extremely friendly staff. We will definitely return and would highly recommend it.",5,2015,12,07
115,Amazing customer service,"Very nice members of stuff, were very helpful through whole stay, area full of bars/restaurants/shops and i got many good recommendations, also the restaurant next door has amazing terrace, definitely coming back, good value for money",5,2015,12,07
115,A great business trip to London,"I had a lot of fun in this hotel.  Is close to Oxford Street, where you can buy almost anything.  The hotel has a library room where you can sit and relax, have a great book.  The rooms are elegant and fancy, I love the Nespresso machine.  I will definetly come back.",5,2015,12,06
115,A Beautiful Setting For Afternoon Tea,"This place is a sea of calm, just off the bustle of Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road. The Lutyens Lobby Lounge is an elegant but relaxing place to while away a few hours, drinking tea and eating sandwiches and cakes. We were served by the lovely Joao, who was friendly and attentive. Service was swift and personal. This is a more intimate space than many of the other choices for afternoon tea in the West End. The price was very reasonable too. We will definitely return.",5,2015,12,06
115,Above and beyond,We told them we were celebrating our daughter's birthday and they got her a cake and a card to be in the room after we returned from the theatre. They were lovely people and could not help enough. Thank you for making our visit memorable.,5,2015,12,05
115,Not so happy,"Stayed there because my company has a special rate. A few points : 
-even though it was pre paid (and indicated as such) the hotel charged my credit card on check-out (and credited it back after a phone call), not professional
-room temperature incredibly high with no way to adjust it on a sustainable basis, made for 2 bad nights
-having to wait 5 minutes for a coffee at breakfast is not acceptable. Bread at breakfast is frozen not freshly baked.

On the positive side, location is convenient, street quiet and amenities nice.",3,2015,12,03
115,Wonderful Experience,"Wow what a place the hotel is fabulous and oozes class with a very relaxed atmosphere ,the rooms are spacious with everything you need for your stay, and then there is the staff the manager Mike Neve and his team were so professional but so warm and friendly.Cant wait to go back  ",5,2015,12,03
115,"Very stylish decor, nice staff","Great location, just a short walk to the British Museum & Soho! Also very close to the Tottenham Court tube stop, so it's a good base for exploring London. The staff here was so friendly! And they light candles throughout the lobby at night that smelled AMAZING! I wish I could've bought one.",5,2015,12,02
115,still excellent!,this was our third stay at the Bloomsbury and I am pleased to say it was as good as we remembered. lovely room. helpful staff and a great location. special thanks to the concierge paolo who was a font of useful information. highly recommended.,5,2015,12,02
115,Our home in London,"I have stayed twice in this hotel during the last two months and even though we have had some issues ( in one room the bed was too soft and old and in another one we had a loud ventilation system) the staff did everything they could to improve our stay and eventually we got back to our room from previous stay : good size for London, day light, comfortable bed and great service and that all in the busy theatre district and next to Oxford street.",5,2015,12,01
115,Christmas shopping weekend,"Had a lovely stay here once again for a weekend of Christmas shopping. Have to again remark on the staff who are so so helpful, nothing is too much trouble a special mention to Naleef (Forgive the spelling :))  we had a wonderful meal at the restaurant you recommended. Would recommend staying at this hotel to anyone, perfect for any occasion. and second to none staff.",5,2015,12,01
115,"Lovely property, carefully and thoughtfully run, good experience","I've recently stayed and run an event at The Bloomsbury Hotel and am happy to confirm that the staff all worked extremely hard to ensure that our experience (and those of our group) were good. The General Manager took great care to ensure that his team understood our needs and delivered what we wanted, and was approachable and friendly at all times. He is most certainly a hotelier (rather than a ""man in a grey suit""!) and this really shows in terms of the customer experience. The food was excellent throughout. I stayed in a suite and, although not large, it was quiet, very comfortable and ideal for my needs. All in all it was a very good experience.",5,2015,11,30
115,A London gem. Old school feel but great service & rooms.,"I travel solo a lot, and always stay at The Bloomsbury as the staff welcome me like family. The rooms from the smallest to suites are beautiful and freshly renovated in a neutral colour palette. 
The breakfast is excellent, with healthy options such as kale salads in summer, fresh juices, fruit, and healthy bread options.
The lobby has towering ceilings and is a gorgeous spot to enjoy a champagne before going out.
Location is spot on, as you can walk to so many London attractions. 
A daily run to Hyde Park and round the perimeter is a highlight in summer, and about 12 kms.",5,2015,11,30
115,Nice hotel,"Everything you'd expect really, nice food, interior and staff. I drove and parking was a faff , the car park is down the road from the hotel ( no valet ), and is extremely tight and smells awful. No hot buffet at breakfast but food was good. My room was tiny and too hot! ",3,2015,11,29
115,Great staff and excellent customer attendance! Beautiful Hotel,"I've been in this hotel last month on a business trip. I'm glad they chose this hotel! Starting with the doorman, Vasco! He had this amazing atittude, a very nice approach and loves soccer just like me!!  Then the room was amazing!!! Much more than i expected! The service was great and I had a great time! Congratulations to the whole team!! The place is great and the neighbourhood aswell. Thank you for the amazing service. I recommend this Hotel!",5,2015,11,29
115,Weekend retreat,"We live in Canary Wharf but decided on a 'local' break away, West End, show, dinner etc. Two nights. It was excellent, staff are fantastically helpful and attentive. Special mention to Chris, our breakfast waiter. Very professional and helpful.",5,2015,11,29
115,A beautiful hotel with lovely smiley staff,"My fiancée and I stayed here after looking at a number of hotels.  I have to say we were delighted - easy check in, lovely staff, well appointed room, a superb breakfast and just a great location ! I called them prior to our trip and told them we were celebrating an anniversary and we had a card and chocolates in the room after we got back from the theatre - a lovely touch !! Highly recommend this hotel - they are a great team - thanks !!! ",5,2015,11,28
115,"Great Food, Outstanding Service!! Brilliant Experience!","Visited the Hotel early last week, had a beautiful meal, the service was fantastic and was a really good experience!! Food was really good , and the wine offer was something else, definitely recommend it if you come visit London! 

Miguel",5,2015,11,28
115,"Beautiful, elegant, although breakfast let things down","I visited here on a Saturday, and received a lovely welcome by the doormen and reception. Room was nicely warm on a cold day and the TV had extra channels. Bathroom was also more than adequate. 

Breakfast was surprisingly poor. No greeting on entry so had to find a table. Coffee order taken well, then nothing. Had a cereal but had to find someone to order a hot dish. We asked the waiter a question which he needed to get advice on ... He never returned. I then was nearly served another tables dish. I then had to go and find a waiter to place an order, which took 15 mins to arrive. In the meantime after ordering two different teas only one arrived, then on complaining the same one arrived again. The waitress argued with me that it wasn't peppermint, but it clearly was - it had a mint tea bag in it. The waitress took all our drinks away away, so we walked off. Potentially a language barrier but it was a disappointment. 
",2,2015,11,23
115,A comfortable hotel in an excellent location,"I ordered a Superior room, with a king bed. Actually the room is a bit small for such a bed.  Location is the best.  Hotel in a side quiet road, 200 meters 5 minutes from Oxford.
 Bed is very comfortable. 
Room is classy, but well equipped in modern furniture and bathroom equipment.  Amenities like soap, shampoo need some improvement. Service a bit slow.
Breakfest is amazing",4,2015,11,22
115,Classy establishment!,"We recently stayed in the Bloomsbury for my husband's 40, and thought it was a lovely hotel - beautiful building, friendly staff and some great attention to detail - plus the cake as a surprise for my husband really made him smile! We'd definitely come back again.",5,2015,11,22
115,MARLENE,"I had a very good experience in the hotel when I stayed there about two weeks ago.

That was not my first time in the hotel and the room I got was not very much what I expected.

I called the front desk and Marlene took instantly care of me and she did everything until I was found a new room that was closer to what I had know before and what I liked.

With staff caring so much as Marlene, a hotel like Bloomsbury becomes a totally different thing, and all its glory shows much more. 

It is not a 5-star hotel, but it feels very close because they care a lot.

Thank you.",4,2015,11,20
115,Awful bar service,"Attended a conference with drinks afterwards, two to three staff at the bar, we were oblivious to them standing at the front, they can only serve left and right, took 15 minutes just to acknowledge us, major drama lager barrel ran out, then no glasses, they ran out obviously rationed, awful service, surely we weren't the first conference they ever dealt with!!!",2,2015,11,19
115,Wonderful hotel in the center,"I've been here for a 3 days conference. 
The people who work in this hotel are really nice and help you everytime. It's a really nice and sophisticated hotel. All the services (bathroom, conference room) were just perfect!
another plus was the food offered for breakfast/lunch....just amazing!!!",5,2015,11,19
115,Great Concierge Service,"I booked theatre tickets with the concierge during my stay. Brian the concierge, was fantastic, he really helped in finding the best tickets for me. I would definitely recommend speaking with the concierge when looking to see a West End show.",4,2015,11,19
115,Disgusting - Avoid,"I booked two nights in this hotel however I only lasted one night. 

The room I was given was tiny, enough room for one single bed and a few steps to a tiny bathroom with a tiny shower( toilet didn't look clean) which was claustrophobic at best. 

The door didn't lock properly and was generally very flimsy and could be very easily forced open from the outside. 

The hotel was noisy due to the location of the rooms with people passing and the old windows don't offer much protection from the noise from the street.

The cup and glass provided were both dirty. 

The room had no air conditioning although the draft from the window was so bad it offset the heat. The window rattled all night with the wind and was filthy and the flimsy curtain was filthy. 

The bed sheets were thankfully clean however covered by a dirty cushion and throw.

Breakfast was a farce as the staff don't take your order if they can avoid it , you have to go into the kitchen  and ask for it and if you want tea you will need to ask for that separately. 

Security is poor with a big sign in the room saying the hotel won't be held responsible if your stuff gets stolen and to use the safe which is small and won't fit a loptop or large tablet. 

The wifi was fine and the TV worked ok but in general you would better booking a hostel or sleeping on the streets. 

I would rate this place as 1* at best and worth a further commute to get a better hotel.",1,2015,11,18
115,"Nice hotel, staff improvements needed","My wife and I stayed for 1 night for an evening in London. On arrival the hotel was well presented, nice reception area with a nice feel. Check-in was not great, defiantly an improvement with the  front desk staff needed. No smiles, no welcomes, just a short shift hello and a check in. Our room wasn't large and the double bed was quite small with a small table in the corner with a chair. The room was clean and tidy, well presented with a walk-in shower. TV on the wall but the remote didn't work, we asked for it to be fixed, that was changed but it still didn't work! The aircon in the room was fine and there was nespresso coffee and free water. We ate in the bar which was down stairs in the basement. This bar was also well presented and had a nice feel and compliments to the barman for great cocktails but I felt for him as he had to serve all night at the bar and at the tables by himself. The food was also very nice to. In the evening we got back at around mid-night and unbelievably they locked the front door. We were left standing on the step with another couple ringing the door bell. There were staff inside so this seemed very strange. Another odd thing is that we wanted a lay-in and next morning when they posted the bills under the doors, they went knocking on all the doors when they did it. I felt like I was back being a child at home with my parents!! We then had breakfast which was really nice, good service, good food. This could of been 5 stars if not for the being locked out, not fixing the remote properly and the wake up call. When I checked out I mentioned this, but that was after the couple on front also complaining about similar issues! My comments were noted on the receptionist large pad, which had a while bunch of scribbles etc so not confident that they will be dealt with. Overall though I would definitely stay again.",4,2015,11,16
115,"excellent location, weak front staff","Pluses- Superb location , less than two blocks from British Museum, close to theatre district and shopping. Hotel quiet, elegant well appointed rooms and reasonably large for London.Minuses-  Poor front staffing- from not knowing general information, not warning re subway closure on Central Line, not knowing where to go for a meal at a local pub and sending daughter away, who arrived late and was told there was no room reserved for her, when staff had been warned about part of group's late arrival. ",3,2015,11,15
115,Chilled hotel ,"Stayed here for one night for a theatre break. A quiet, clean and comfy room on the fifth floor but close to theatreland.
After seeing the Book of Mormon we came back to the hotel and enjoyed cocktails in the Landseer bar. Even if you're not a guest, well worth a cheeky visit - Alex will rustle you up something not on the menu if you have a specific request 😊",4,2015,11,14
115,Fantastic stay for rememberance weekend,"Second time staying at this fabulous hotel. Staff are friendly, polite and helpful. Rooms are beautiful with beds that are so comfortable! Breakfast is a speciality and not to be missed. The scented candles in reception are gorgeous, I wonder if we can buy them? 

Thank you Bloomsbury, we shall return",5,2015,11,14
115,Awesome hotel ,First time at this hotel wasn't disappointed lovely room restaurant superb great bar great staff very helpfull not far from tube stations Oxford Street only a 5-10 min walk well worth staying at this hotel ,5,2015,11,13
115,Didn't Stay but wish we had!,As we were having a poor experience at the Kenilworth we decided to stop here for a cup of tea/ soft drink.  Based on our experience we would much rather have stayed here.  See my review of the Kenilworth - don't eat the porridge!,4,2015,11,12
115,"Perfect room, great service, ideal location","We had a wonderful four night stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel. The location was perfect, on a quiet street just around the corner from the Tottenham Court tube, a short walk into Soho, Covent Gardens and Seven Dials, and the theatre district, and just down the street from the British Museum. Our room was perfect, with a king bed and view out to the side street, thanks to Marlene at the front desk who graciously upgraded us from a smaller room. Everyone was so welcoming, and we struck up friendships with Naleef at the door and Joao in the tea room. We had a delightful afternoon tea, and a fresh juice on the terrace another afternoon. We loved the hotel's relaxed but elegant style. Highly recommended!",5,2015,11,10
115,Event at Bloomsbury Hotel - amazing,"We recently held a corporate event at the Bloomsbury Hotel for 120 people.  From the planning stage to execution, we received first class service.

The event / banqueting staff were absolutely excellent and deserve every one of the 5 stars I have awarded them.  Despite having to cater for over 100 people, the food was exquisite, vegetarians and those with allergies were well catered for and the feedback was that it was exceptional.

I would highly recommend using this hotel to anyone wanting to organise an event, whether it be corporate or personal.  The aesthetics in the Queen Mary Room are beautiful. 

I would describe the hotel and staff as incredibly professional, personable and welcoming.",5,2015,11,10
115,Another great Doyle Collection hotel,"This was our first time at the Bloomsbury Hotel, but we stay regularly at the other hotels in the Doyle Collection. There is something very special about this group - the staff are welcoming, the concierge is knowledgeable and the rooms are always very clean. The breakfast was very good, especially the home-baked scones. The fruit juices and yoghurts are probably slightly better at the Marylebone, but the hot food was just as good. We would not hesitate to choose this group in Ireland or Bristol based on our experiences in London.",5,2015,11,07
115,"Fabulous stay, as usual!","We have just returned from our stay at the Bloomsbury and once again, we had a fabulous time.  This is our fifth time (2nd time this year) at the Bloomsbury and we truly feel like it is our home away from home in London.  From the moment we walk thru the door we feel so welcomed by every member of the staff.  We had a wonderful room on the 7th floor, very comfortable and quiet, just what we needed after a few long nights out enjoying the London night life.

We would like to especially give our thanks to the fabulous concierge staff - Brian, Naleef, Gary & Andre, who went above and beyond to fulfill our needs. You all were the very best and we look forward to seeing you again very soon!

Alex Anguiano and Cathi Nunn",5,2015,11,04
115,Comfort & style,"Just a short stay here to see a show but very impressed with the Hotel and its facilities.
The Hotel has a very comfortable and classy ambience which is echoed by the decor.
The rooms are a good size and comfortable with smart clean bathrooms and every other facility a modern traveller would require.
The staff from the Concierge to the Duty Manager were very polite, attentive and efficient.
We only had a breakfast stay but if that's anything to go by the lunch & dinners must be superb!!
The Hotel is ideally situated for reaching Regent Street, Oxford Street, Leicester Square and Chinatown on foot.
We shall certainly stay here again on our next London visit.",4,2015,11,04
115,Impeccable standard of service from every member of the hotel staff,"We booked for a sunday evening having obtained last minute Bob Dylan tickets for the Albert Hall. The booking online was faultless and very efficient. Our room was a junior suite at one corner of the hotel on the 4th floor, well away from the hum at street level that exists even on a sunday evening in London. The room was equipped to a very high standard, it was exceptionally clean and just at the right temperature using the very effective air con. The bathroom was as big as many hotel bedrooms with a fabulous multi-function shower together with an enormous roll top free standing bath. 
On our return from the Albert Hall we were delighted to notice that the bed had been turned down and that there was a platter of fresh fruit on our table alongside chilled bottled water. Precisely what was needed after a concert and tube ride back to the hotel.
Breakfast followed a very deep and undisturbed sleep in the enormous bed. At breakfast we quickly remembered one of the major reasons why this hotel is so special in our opinion. It's the quality and care offered by all members of staff no matter where they operate in the organisation. Nothing is too much trouble, yet there is no sign of the obsequious and off putting behaviour that is evident in some big city hotels. On the contrary, the staff are professional but also friendly, attentive but also discreet, clearly hard working but always appearing relaxed. Someone in the management in this hotel must be doing something right!",5,2015,11,03
115,I keep coming back,"Next year will be my 4th visit to this hotel.  I feel welcome here - the hotel is clean, the staff friendly and courteous, the rooms comfortable, and the area is close to great shopping, restaurants and transportation.  The bartender did know what I liked to drink!  I can't find a hotel in London to compare for comfort and convenience.....that's why I keep coming back.",5,2015,11,02
115,Quaint London Hotel,"The Bloomsbury was a very nice, clean and quiet hotel. Here for pleasure for 4 nights. Small room from an American standard, but manageable. Very close to British museum though seemed a little further from other attractions. Tottenham Tube Station was closed partially which led to further walks, but once finished would be very easy access to city. Had dinner at Landseer restaurant- nice environment and great service, good food. Very friendly staff. Had umbrella in room which came in handy one day! would stay again and recommend. ",4,2015,11,02
115,four days of fun in london,"Do you want an excellent moderately priced hotel in the heart of london?
do you want a bartender to know what you like to drink?
do you want hot shower with strong water pressure?
do you want good espresso a short walk away on Shop Street?
do you want a comfortable bed with no street noise?
then stay at this hotel.",5,2015,10,31
115,"Quiet, calm, and very entertaining Hotel","Hello there, it was a great pleasure to stay in this hotel, it was my first time there but for sure won't be the last!! I've had a great time, my room was beautiful and clean, not to big but not to small also. Was my first time in London and I've to thank you all concierge staff and Vasco who helped us (me and my wife) the 4 nights we stayed there. The staff always treated us nicely and always had a smile on their faces when they went to help us. We didn't see much in the hotels we've passed, but this one really surprised us!
Thank you very much to all and I hope to see you again soon.",5,2015,10,31
115,Afternoon tea at the new outside restaurant / bar at the Bloomsbury Hotel,"Afternoon tea was a wonderful experience at the new outside restaurant of the Bloomsbury Hotel. 

Not only is it really beautifully done and the food is delicious - but most importantly the staff were so friendly and helpful that it makes you want to return. 

A really special place😄😄",5,2015,10,30
115,A perfect little gem,"We just returned from London and had a fabulous stay st the Bloomsbury Hotel!  The staff was attentive and charming and out room exceeded our expectations! Just a few blocks from the hustle bustle, it was always a pleasure to return to this charming hotel!",5,2015,10,29
115,Weekend Away,"We planned a weekend in London to see a show and see the sights. We have stayed in hotels just outside the capital prev iously but decided to stay nearer this time. The Bloomsbury was perfectly situated. Just a short walk from Tottenham Court Road tube station and ten minutes from the theatres. The staff were excellent. They were friendly and confident in their work. The rooms were spotlessly clean,althogh ours was let down slightly by a stained chair. Although the room was a little on the small side it was very well equipped. Breakfast was perfect!! The only small downside was that the room had no window with a view. The window had a blind between two panes of glass which just faced a sort of atrium which I assumed was necessary for light. We were on the fourth floor and as breakfast was on lower ground floor we didn't really know what the weather was like until we were actually outside an hour or so after getting up!! That said it was a quiet, well run hotel and  we will definitely return here on our next visit.",5,2015,10,28
115,Second visit,"Second time I've stayed at this lovely boutique hotel and was again very happy. Good location, wonderful restaurant and very friendly bar. I think I'm going to make this my regular hotel of choice when in London. The only mild niggle I have is the poor lighting in my room, it's a bit dark, maybe higher energy bulbs ? Overall thoroughly enjoyed my visit.",5,2015,10,28
115,A wonderful stay,"We booked The Bloomsbury Hotel for 10 days.  I had read good reviews on Tripadvisor and we were very pleased with our experience.  The location is less than 2 blocks from The British Museum, and Soho and Covent Garden are convenient walks.  Other popular areas for shopping and sightseeing are also walkable from the hotel.  The hotel block is amazingly quiet and calm compared to the traffic and crowds on roads within a block in any direction . More importantly, the closest tube station - the Tottenham Court Road station is less than a 5 minute walk.  
Our room was smallish but so comfortable and cozy.  The queen bed was more like a full size bed in the U.S., but I think that is common abroad.  Everything was very clean.  The hotel provides a Nespresso machine and coffee pods, an electric tea pot, tea, instant hot chocolate & coffee, cookies and bottles of water at no charge in addition to the mini bar with different drinks to buy.  There wasn't a dresser to unpack our clothes, which was the only minor negative of our room since we had to keep most everything in our suitcase (which I brought too much).  Normally I wouldn't unpack for a short stay, but we hung up what we wanted in the closet.
The wifi was good - better than at many hotels we've stayed at in the US.  There were plenty of charging stations by the desk and even a US plug outlet!  I didn't need to use the adapter I brought.
In the evening, housekeeping offered turn down service and left robes and chocolates for us and replaced any hand towels we may have used in the bathroom.  The marble bathroom is also small, but the shower/bath worked very well.  There wasn't a lot of counter space but the space is efficiently organized so you have full use of what there is.  
The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The one or 2 minor problems in our room were taken care of immediately.  The concierge made dinner reservations for us and we relied on him daily for directions and restaurant suggestions near the hotel.  We ate several dinners on Charlotte Street which is about 2 blocks away in the Fitzrovia neighborhood. 
I liked that the hotel was smallish but luxurious.  The price was a good price compared to other nice hotels I considered in London.  After seeing the busy streets where some of these other hotels are located, I am doubly glad to have stayed at The Bloomsbury Hotel.",5,2015,10,27
115,Memorable weekend,"My wife and I visited for a short stay to celebrate her birthday with the stay and a theatre visit, we were upgraded to start with which was a great surprise, the birthday extras and room extras were perfectly arranged and delivered by the very thoughtful and attentive staff, we will definitely stay again, we are planning a visit to Dublin soon and will definitely use the Doyle group hotel there, can't praise enough, thank you ",5,2015,10,26
115,"Great accommodation, poor conferencing","The hotel is a true beauty in central London. The accommodation rooms are elegantly decorated and very comfortable. Would definitely want to stay in the room again. The conferencing on the other hand was poor. Smelly rooms, poor equipment, smokers outside the window of the room and noisy construction going on.",3,2015,10,23
115,Brilliant Birthday Treat!,"Stayed here for 2 nights as part of a group. Hotel is beautiful and only a few minutes walk from the underground. The staff were fantastic and couldn't do enough to help you. Got spoilt with a birthday cake and complementary breakfast mimosas! It's London so don't expect massive rooms but we spent very little time there anyway, so the comfy beds were all that we cared about. Breakfast was lovely and had a great selection. If you want to sleep in after a weekends festivities, remember to put your do not disturb on, housekeeping are up and about early and persistent! Would definitely come back on my next trip to London!",5,2015,10,21
115,Superb afternoon tea,"Excellent service. Literally freshly baked scones to order. Flavoursome tea that makes you think you have never drink tea in your life before., sandwiches, cakes, everything on the platters a total delight. I just wish we had allowed at least 2 hours for the experience. Will go again and 100% recommend ",5,2015,10,17
115,Comfortable stay,"Very comfortable and quiet stay. Clean premises. A historic building. Great location - very close to the British museum and Soho square. Walking distance to the tube. Extra perks - Staff left goodies each day in the room such as fruits, pastries etc",5,2015,10,16
115,Very nice quiet hotel,"The rooms were very clean, even had a north American power outlet in the room (just 1) and USB chargers built into the wall the bed was very comfortable and the breakfast downstairs was delicious, the location was also very good close to both Soho and museums the only negative thing that happened was I got locked out at like 4am once..eventually got let in after 5 minutes or so of pounding on the door. Overall a very pleasant stay however.",5,2015,10,16
115,From Ashes to Riches,"A disasterous  start ! Turn-up -no room no booking! Done though On-Hotels (Bloomsbury man stated previous problems with them). Told we would have to go to sister hotel miles away  ---- made to feel our fault, or that of OnHotels, 20 minues later insisted on seeing manager. Young can-do charming lady turned up, showed empathy, sorted us a room with calm efficency.  Brilliant - first half hour now forgiven!!
The Bloomsbury Hotel -- very good, staff attentive and polite, bedroom small (cosy) yet immaculate and well fitted. Breakfast spread excellant and plentiful.  Would go again?-- a definate Yes but though direct booking. Hope you enjoy as we eventualy did ! 
  ",4,2015,10,15
115,Fantastic Afternoon tea,"We went to this hotel for afternoon tea. Fantastic venue, beautiful building crammed with period features. We had a private room, ' the library' that could accommodate 16 people. The waitress serving us was very attentive and hospitable. The afternoon tea was average for London hotels. Overall a very pleasant experience.",4,2015,10,12
115,Wonderful hotel!,Hotel customer service was amazing!  The breakfast was awesome and our servers Alex and Bogdan went above and beyond.  Great location.  The concierge and hotel staff were so helpful!!  Would recommend this hotel and would stay here again!,5,2015,10,11
115,5* stay in London! ,"Me and my fiancée had a wonderful two night stay at The Bloomsbury. Our room was decorated beautifully with a nice bath and shower. All the staff were friendly and a big thanks to Sebastian for printing off our boarding passes the evening before and then leaving them in our room for us. 

Tottenham Court Road tube station was just round the corner and we were able to reach the shard and O2 arena really easily.
Breakfast was delicious too and we look forward to trying dinner next time we come!

Thank you Bloomsbury, see you soon!",5,2015,10,11
115,Weekend break,"I stay at the Bloomsbury hotel every time I stay in London , it is perfectly situated to allow you to reach everything that you could possibly want to do on your visit to London , the Hotel itself gets better and better ,every visit gets more enjoyable , this is a Hotel that never rests on its lorels , the standard of rooms , the food the bar excell and the staff cannot do enough for you , everything is done with a smile ,,",5,2015,10,10
115,Anniversary treat,"We were celebrating our wedding anniversary, when we arrived about 11.30 we did not expect to be able to check in, just leave our case. Adriana asked what we were doing in London, she gave as an upgrade, we were able to check in straight away which was great. When we came back in later we had a lovely letter from Adriana wishing us a happy anniversary. All the staff were lovely, friendly and happy, you are made to feel special.
A really lovely place, close to theatres, shops, will definitely use again. Thanks to you all",5,2015,10,09
115,Great hotel once you get the right room,"We stayed for 5 nights in this hotel. It is a very nice hotel in a great but quiet location. We booked a superior room and were initially given a room that I would have called a standard room. Very small with very limited space. We spoke to Customer Relations manager, Sebastian Annandale, who moved us to a much more adequately sized room and the rest of our stay was very nice. We want to particularly acknowledge Sebastian. He was the most helpful person we have ever encountered at a hotel. He not only helped us with a better room but also gave us great suggestions for restaurants and left us personalized notes in our room. Thanks Sebastian for making our stay at The Bloomsbury an excellent one!",5,2015,10,06
115,Great hotel - Location and all,"Our check in was late, at around 3 o'clock (AM) , still, we were greeted by a staff member with a smile, the check-in was super quick, the room was ready.

The room was very nice, very clean, well equipped (note: we were in a superior room) .
It was quiet  - No noise from the outside or the hallway.

The hotel location is superb - 
Very central: walking distance from Leicester and Trafalgar square,  as well as Oxford  street and a two minute walk from the (Tottenham court road ) tube station.

=====

After I made my reservation, I requested to change the room the a  twin bed room, to my surprise that was only possible by upgrading to a superior room (they have no standard twin bed rooms) so I had to add more money than I expected (to a sum that was already a bit more than I had initially planned for...) 

I chose this hotel mainly because it seemed to have the highest probability of being a really good hotel with minimal risk of trouble or ""bad experience issues"" (e.g  noisy, dirty, unfriendly staff etc.) . It might have cost more than I initially planed to spend on a hotel (and then even more due to the upgrade for twin beds...) and did not include breakfast(pity...), but it was worth it ! 

Extra (2) notes:
1. Just outside the hotel (when you exit the hotel-turn left) there's a very nice and cozy diner open 24 hours a day) 
2. On the parallel street (exit the hotel, turn left, then turn left again and cross the street) there's a super market (grocery store) open from 6:00 to 23:00 - very comfortable for getting what you need for the day ahead :)",5,2015,10,06
115,In the Heart of the Arts,"During September 2015 we spent a week at The Bloomsbury..This historic building has been renovated as a beautiful hotel, with attractive, comfortable rooms and lovely  public areas. The service we received from check-in to check-out was personal and friendly. The breakfasts were generous and delicious. The Bloomsbury is located just 2 blocks from the famed British Museum.The West End theaters are a short walk away. Tube station and bus stops are also close-by. If we are in London again, we will definitely stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel.",5,2015,10,05
115,Wonderful weekend away,A great hotel with fantastic location for theatre etc. Staff very friendly and efficient. The Bar has an excellent array of drinks on offer with a nice ambience.  Breakfast was included in our rate - a huge array of choice.  We will definitely like to come back. ,5,2015,10,05
115,Afternoon Tea,"We went for an afternoon tea deal which was £45 and included unlimited champagne.   Don't get me wrong champagne was flowing and we certainly took advantage of this but the food was a let down.   Just 3 finger sandwiches and a salmon canape sandwich for savory.  The scones were very nice but the rest of the cakes were average and a bit sickly.    However, the waiter was lovely and friendly and he deserved this tip for being attentive and helpful.",3,2015,09,28
115,Excellent hotel in London!,"A good hotel in downtown of London. Location, service, rooms, staff, all is good. Near of the British Museum and other cultural points. Near of the shoppings, tude, and theathers. I have been there for business, but i wil return with my family.
      
      ",5,2015,09,27
115,Very disappointing stay,"I found this hotel very unfriendly. The staff didn't really interact with you at all.  We had dinner booked in the restaurant and when arriving there found that there was a private party going on in the bar which is right next to the restaurant with no doors and hence made the restaurant very noisy. Not what you would expect from this sort of hotel charging high prices for the restaurant.  We chose not to stay to eat at the restaurant and so therefore had to find somewhere outside the hotel to each.  Not something we really wanted to do,  we did complain and spoke to the manager/duty manager on returning who didn't really have much to say and said it would be noted and sorted out on our check out.  Nothing was said at check out other than asking if we enjoyed our stay. We said our room was nice but had issue with the restaurant,  he didn't ask us what the problem was just said sorry about that,  all in all a very disappointing stay.  We certainly won't be returning,",2,2015,09,27
115,Another great stay,"Second stay at The Bloomsbury this year and yet again it was a great stay.
Location is fantastic and staff very friendly and efficient.
Room was bright, clean and well made upon check in and daily housekeeping and turn down service was greatly appreciated.
",5,2015,09,25
115,Excellent Value For The Money,We are from America and stayed here based on recommendation our our travel agent.  It exceeded our expectations.  The rooms were very comfortable and they take great pride in keeping the rooms very clean.  Breakfast was part of the cost and included being able to order off the menu at no extra cost.  That guaranteed a good and satisfying breakfast.  The electronics in the room was fantastic.  It included a plug for american chargers and included USB ports.  We were not expecting that.  This is very definitely a class act and we will stay here again if we are fortunate enough to come to London again.,5,2015,09,23
115,"Nice Hotel, Great Location","Stayed at the Bloomsbury for 1 wk (last week) to drop off my son to University. The hotel is very clean, staff was friendly enough but not ""super "" friendly. My room was small but cozy, clean, and well appointed, housekeeping staff were amazing. Hotel is in an amazing location..Tottenham Crt Rd is 2 min walk away, Goodge tube is 5 min walk. Covent Garden is about 10 min walk.. The bar is in the basement, small, boring...as well the restaurant is in the basement and to be honest the breakfast is not worth it. There are plently of places outside and cheaper.  I would go back to the Bloomsbury only because it is close to my son's dorm other than that I would try another hotel that has a better lobby , bar, restaurant ,atmosphere.",4,2015,09,23
115,Wouldn't stay again,"Stayed here for 4 nights room was the smallest we have ever stayed in . Breakfast was pleasant with a good selection to choose from. The lobby bar was extremely quite all through our stay . Hotel lacks atmosphere ,location was  close to top end of Oxford Street . Will stay somewhere closer to regent st when taking the missus on her next shopping trip ",3,2015,09,22
115,Great Hotel and First Class Service,"From the minute we arrived to when we left , we were treated exceptionally well. The receptionist  allowed us to check in despite arriving several hours earlier and our room was available straight away. The reception staff were very pleasant and welcoming as was the doorman who seemed to be on duty our entire stay. 
The room was clean and well appointed, if a little on the small size , but this didn't affect us. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. Nice IPod docking station, wifi, refreshments / coffee maker etc. 
The breakfast had a nice selection of cereal , fruit , breads, cold cuts and hot menu with a delicious English breakfast amongst others. The table next to ours had multiple requests for special diets , and all appeared to be well catered for. The dining room was quiet and well organised , which is nice at that time in a morning.
Overall I would highly recommend this hotel , it has a perfect location and easy to get to from Tottenham Court Rd tube station. 
Great staff, who deserve to be praised.",5,2015,09,22
115,The Best Service,Service was excellent from beginning to end.  The hotel's amenities are lovely and they provided everything we could have wanted.  The bed is very comfortable.  We had a small room on the 5th floor  - no view - but is was fitted out very nicely.  The bath is beautiful - all in white marble.,5,2015,09,21
115,"Great hotel, great location.","The Bloomsbury is a great hotel. The rooms are very well appointed, the staff is exceptional and the location is very close to many of the main tourist sites, theatres and shopping in central London. We certainly hope to stay there again.",5,2015,09,21
115,Amazing breakfast,"We went there a six  months ago for having breakfast and we were so much enjoy and satisfied in all foods that we ate and to all services that they gave. All the staffs are professional when it comes to their task of serving the food, they looked after us all the time. In addition to this thank you so much for all the chefs who prepared the food on that time....",5,2015,09,20
115,A charming home away from home,"From the second I arrived, I felt at home here as the doorman rushed down the stairs to help me out of the taxi. The friendly welcome and the delightful scent from high quality scented candles were utterly charming. The atmosphere is very welcoming and warm, as you might expect from this Lutyens building which was originally designed as a club. My room was very well appointed and was like a small home away from home, even down to my beloved Nespresso machine and generous tea-making facilities.  A comfy armchair and foot stool and lovely bathroom toiletries completed the package. The food provided for our lunch was excellent. This is an altogether charming hotel and I was quite sad to leave.",4,2015,09,19
115,"Excellent hotel, great location","I stayed at the Bloomsbury for business travel for 5 nights.  The hotel was conveniently located, with the closest Tube station being Tottenham Ct. Rd.  The hotel was clean and had a great warmth about it.  My room was very clean and comfortable, and after a busy day working in London, an quiet and relaxing space to come ""home"" to.  Just out the doors and over to Oxford St. if you like shopping, its all there.  If you like running?  Straight down Oxford St. to Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens.  The only downfall?  Service in the restaurant was slow and unattentive. While the food was good, the service was passive and didn't hold up the standards the rest of the staff seemed to adhere to.  Overall, a great stay, and I would highly recommend.",4,2015,09,18
115,Seamus Heaney Library a bonus,Excellent room with all amenities plus staff help. Bonus of seeing the Seamus Heaney Library and poet portraits in the corridor. The chapel is also worth a visit. Good to see the history of the building booklet in the room as well. These things make the hotel rather special. We do hope the library is well used- what a superb venue for poetry readings and music! Is there a librarian and a link to Poetry in the City to build a regular use of this lovely tribute to Seamus Heaney- I would hate to see it fall into disuse and the books do need a thorough organisation.,5,2015,09,18
115,Amazing hotel. Attention to detail fantastic,What an amazing stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel. We celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary here at the beginning of September and were made to feel so special. Had a lovely surprise when we came back to our room having been out in the afternoon to find the room tastefully decorated with rose petals and a gorgeous cake. The staff were so friendly and helpful and a special mention must go to Caroline for making our stay truly memorable. The location of the hotel is brilliant as can walk to theatres / bars / restaurants. The breakfast too was lovely - loved the soda bread! Thank you again to all the staff for a fabulous weekend. Look forward to coming back again.,5,2015,09,17
115,Ridiculously small room and poor quality renovation!,"We stayed one evening in this hotel with two rooms with two adults in each standard room.  One of the rooms was reasonably sized, but the other was ridiculously small - I think it was room 704 (or 706).  I am completely at a loss to understand how a hotel could put two adults in this room!  We were literally tripping over each other.  The closet and bathroom were micro-sized.  This hotel appeared to rely too much on its reputation and the history of the building.  It had been recently renovated and it was very poor quality - the bed slide easily across the carpet and the cabinet door on the mini-fridge was broken-off.  How could no one have seen this and fixed it?  We stayed in another hotel in London for far less money and much better size and value.

The hotel is extremely convenient location for the British Museum and to the shopping on Oxford street.  Be aware that while this hotel is close to the Tottenham Court subway stop, the central line did not stop at that station when we were there.  This isn't an issue with the hotel - although I don't remember seeing any warning on their website.",2,2015,09,16
115,Unique comfort in the heart of London,"I stayed in this hotel for two nights and it was such an incredibly comfortable and convenient place for a business traveler. The desk was a very good size and had a US outlet right above it that actually worked. I had an adapter, but it was nice to have that. The room was a bit on the small side, but it actually made the room a bit cozier. 

The waiters in the breakfast area were slightly disorganized, but the buffet was delicious with lots of options.  

Walking distance to the british museum and various hospitals.",5,2015,09,15
115,"Impressive customer service, good location","Good central location & only a short uber drive away from the theatre district. 

As it was a Saturday I parked directly opposite the hotel however secure parking with NCP can be found a few hundred yards away.",4,2015,09,14
115,Impressive staff,"I stayed for five days in a standard room and had a great experience. 
Cons:
- No bathtub
- The reach-around needed to turn on the shower without getting sprayed by cold water 
was a stretch
- Small(ish) room (probably standard for a large city)
Pros:
- Incredibly well-stocked room. Full tea service, Nespresso machine, two glass bottles of water, cookies, truffle chocolates left during turndown service.
- Staff restocked room twice per day. Not only that, they discovered that I preferred the carbonated water and started stocking two of those rather than the initial mix of still and carbonated. Truly impressive.
- Polite and welcoming staff
- Really well-stocked rooms",5,2015,09,13
115,Wonderful stay,"We chose The Bloomsbury Hotel for its proximity to the British Museum.  We were blown away first by how beautiful it is then by the wonderful, helpful, friendly staff.  Yes, the rooms are small compared with the American hotels we've used, but the stay was a joy and we can't say that about any of the American hotels we've used.",5,2015,09,11
115,Great value - fab location,We were lucky enough to get an upgrade. The room was enormous and very inviting. I ended up using it as a work space. The hotel has amazing service. They are very kind and forthcoming. I was on a ridiculous diet but the restaurant sill managed to cook really tasty food for me. I also enjoyed the gym. It is underground but well equipped for an over all work out.,4,2015,09,11
115,Excellent setting and very friendly and professional staff,"We stayed for one night and we were warmly welcomed on arrival. The room as lovely and plenty of places to perch other than just the bed which was quite nice. 

The only reason this hotel does not have a 5 star review was that the toilet didn't have much room around it and was pretty much in a tight spot. The bathroom door is also opaque but you can see shadows and shapes through it. It's not a room I would have appreciated had this been my first night away with my partner to a hotel, you could hear the other person in the toilet! 5 minutes after we arrived i was about to get changed when there was a knock on the door, before i had a chance to answer or re-button my trousers the door was opened by a member of staff to ask did we want a turn down service. If a room is occupied I wouldn't expect anyone to enter the room let alone so quickly after the initial knock.

Other than this, yes we would probably stay here again if we needed to be at this end of town.",4,2015,09,10
115,Perfect...,"A beautiful building with outstanding staff who are happy to treat every guest as a VIP.  The room was excellent with lots of little extra touches elevating this hotel from something good to something excellent.  Breakfast was spot-on, lots of choice on the continental side of things  and a perfectly cooked English breakfast in a lovely dining room.  The location is almost unbeatable, just a 5 minute stroll to Oxford Street and several theatres along with tons of restaurants.  

We found the Bloomsbury to be clearly high class and 5* but unpretentious unlike some other London central hotels of a similar ilk.

THE perfect base in central London.",5,2015,09,10
115,Excellent 1st class Service,"very impressed with this cozy hotel. We had a suite on the 5th floor. On arrival Sebastion greeted us on Reception. service was superb also from the guys on Concierge. Booked a lovely Family Italian restaurant for us on the first night. Adriana checked us out at the end of our weekend stay and was most helpful.
All in all a very pleasant experience and we would certainly book this hotel again. Thank you to the team at The Bloomsbury Hotel.",5,2015,09,09
115,Attention to details in a fine London hotel,"The hotel is well-located, tastefully decorated, has a fine bar and restaurant. But what distinguished the Bloomsbury was the service. A warm greeting awaited our family every morning at breakfast, and our personal preferences were remembered by the staff. The larger room had space for a extra bed - perfect for our daughter - not easy to find in a London hotel in this price range.",5,2015,09,08
115,Dream Holiday,"I went to London for my birthday. The staff made me feel very welcome and even left a birthday card, glass of champagne and cake in my room. 

The hotel and room was better then I imagined. I was very pleased with my stay and when I go back to London I will stay there again.",5,2015,09,08
115,Fantastic!,"My wife and I decided to spend 4 nights in London after our England 15 day bus tour.
I would highly recommend this because there is so much to see and do in London.
We decided to stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel after many recommendations from our friends who had stayed there.We weren't disappointed!
The staff was excellent the service was the best and the breakfasts were great!The location was great with the Museum just down the street and the Tube a short walk.
You won't be disappointed.",5,2015,09,07
115,Lovely break,"We've just enjoyed a three night stay here for our anniversary. The location was great, the room well equipped and clean and the food (breakfast and dinner) lovely. All staff were excellent - polite, helpful and efficient. 

On Thursday evening I had sprained my ankle (away from the hotel, I hasten to add) and was in pain and the reception staff were excellent. Ice and cushions were quickly brought; one member of staff helped my husband get me back to my room; and I was urged to ring down for more ice any time I needed it during the night. Thank you for a lovely stay. We will certainly return when next in London. ",4,2015,09,07
115,Excellent apart from breakfast,"Greeted with a hot towel to freshen up by Sebastian who was friendly and professional. The room was wonderfully equipped with all mod cons and the whole experience worthy of a four star hotel apart from a disappointing breakfast. My husband had the full English but it was rather dry,I had eggs benedict and it was almost inedible due to the vinegary taste. We did eat in the restaurant and the food was delicious. We had steak which was cooked to perfection and chicken which was tasty and succulent. The desserts were absolutely delicious - rice pudding and a selection of 4 ice creams/sorbets. Gorgeous and would definitely stay again as the breakfast problems were hopefully a one off issue. The hotel is well positioned for the theatres and the British museum.",4,2015,09,06
115,Supremacy and Good Taste,"Beside the fact the Hotel is completely beautiful and extremely well decorated and maintained, the Staff is tremendously fined trained and courteous. From the beginning until the last minute of our stay, we have only compliments for the Treatment we received, the quality of the Food, the level of the cleanliness and conservation of the entire building. Congratulations not only to the Hotel Management Team, but also to each of the employee is genuinely involved into make this happening. Outstanding job!",5,2015,09,05
115,Another 5 star stay!,"Thoroughly enjoyed our second stay at the Bloomsbury, great room, lovely bathroom and cracking breakfast! Didn't have an evening meal but had drinks in the bar, very pleasant chap behind the bar and the £10 discount was a nice touch that resulted in a delicious cocktail. Look forward to many more visits",5,2015,09,05
115,A prefect visit: Welcoming and comfortable.,"This is my second visit to the Bloomsbury hotel and we were made so welcome that it felt like home. The hotel rooms are extremely comfortable. I had the best sleep in ages. The staff could not be more accommodating and welcoming. 
We ate in the Landseer restaurant on our first night and had a wonderful meal. We were celebrating a friend's birthday so I asked the staff if they could pop a candle in his dessert. When the time arrived they presented him with a decorated birthday cake! I cannot recommend this hotel more highly.",5,2015,09,04
115,Can't say enough great things about this hotel,"We just concluded our second stay at the Bloomsbury, and I already can't wait until the next time. As you check in, they give you hot towels and juice, which sums up their warm, thoughtful attitude towards their guests. The location is absolutely unbeatable, the rooms are spacious and luxurious, the air conditioning is fantastic and the breakfasts are delicious (expensive on their own, so worth getting a package deal). This is really a lovely place.",5,2015,09,04
115,Highlight of our time in London,"Despite the closest tube stop being (under construction), I would still stay there!  Wonderful staff, SUPER clean rooms, quiet location.  Our room smelled a little like fresh paint, which didn't bother us at all- it was nice to know updating was going on.  Even thought it is a historic property, it felt like a brand new room!",5,2015,09,03
115,"Perfect location, excellent service","We stayed two nights in this hotel located near Oxford Str., Close to the subway. Some restaurants and pubs are within walking distance, and we even walked to the Novello Theatre (Mamma Mia).

The entrance is very beautiful, and we had a really great service at check-in. The room is quite small, and the bath-room also. A Nespresso machine (unfortunately defective) and a ""courtesy"" tea tray are available. One downside: the bed (relatively small, 140cm?) does not match the rest. It really is much too soft, and the mattress has lived ...

Hotel to be recommended if rates are attractive, especially due to its location.",4,2015,09,02
115,Great location for theatre district.,"Lovely room for three (with extra bed), fancy coffee machine, umbrellas in the room.  Very clean, comfortable rooms with spacious bathroom.   V quiet room but central location close to shops, restaurants and theatres. All staff very friendly, no airs and graces,  luxury feel hotel. Really nice.  British museum literally a few minutes walk away.",4,2015,08,31
115,Great hotel Great location,"We choose this hotel as we were attending our son's graduation nearby. The location is fantastic, just within a  few yards of the British museum and Oxford street. The hotel is fabulous, very comfortable with beautifully appointed rooms.
We were made to feel very welcome and an acknowledgment was received from the hotel regarding our Son's special occasion .We did not eat in the restaurant but did use the bar for cocktails which are fantastic. All staff were polite and courteous and we would defiantly book this hotel again.  ",5,2015,08,30
115,Home in the Heart of London,"Its a wonderful hotel in a perfect location, but what is even better is the staff. Brian could help us to make most out of our trip to London. Breakfast was awesome - great choices and very delicious. Really nothing to complain about!",5,2015,08,30
115,Attractive Hotel,"Our 5 night stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel in London was quite pleasant. The hotel has an attractive look, a friendly staff, and pleasant rooms. A large mirror gives the rooms a larger feel, but I wouldn't have minded having some extra space that was real. The shower is quite small, with a swinging half-curtain made of glass. The floor seems destined to get wet.",4,2015,08,29
115,Luxurious Afternoon tea at The Bloomsbury Hotel,"Elegant, sumptuous, yet relaxed surroundings provided the perfect backdrop for an Afternoon tea with friends to celebrate a 60th birthday on Friday August 14th. Situated in a cosy corner of the lobby lounge, we received attentive, polite & most of all friendly service from the staff & a generous spread of mainly sweet delights presented in several towering cake stand tiers, placed in between guests to share accordingly. One of the best Aternoon teas in London I have experienced, and will definitely return again !",5,2015,08,28
115,Great Location,"Really close to Oxford Street. Good location for shopping.  Room was a disappointment  a double room was too dark and small in my opinion, although nicely decorated, it had an extremely small bathroom. Window was facing an enclosed brick wall so no view at all.  

Over charged on the mini bar but this was rectified immediately.  

Afternoon tea was advertised as being serviced up until 6pm, we arrived back to the hotel at 5 pm and asked for afternoon tea and was told we could not have it, when I mentioned we were residents it took them 20 minutes to decide that yes we could have tea.  It was lovely the only criticism I would have is there were not enough savory items, but they did bake us a batch of scones as they had run out and they were well worth waiting for.

I did a review for the hotel online as they requested as above and had an email back  offering as a gesture of goodwill a complimentary breakfast on our next visit.",4,2015,08,28
115,We had a nice stay!,"This is a well located, service-oriented hotel.  It is lovely and clean with all the amenities you could need.  I didn't have pounds for a cab (hard to find a cab that will take credit card in London) and was stranded on the east end of London in the rain.  The Bloomsbury Hotel even offered to pay the cab for me and charge it to my room!  I would have never expected this and it really got me out of a jam!",5,2015,08,27
115,Beautiful hotel,"When you step inside this hotel you are taken away by its beautiful large lobby.  Service here was fantastic and exactly what you would expect for a hotel of this standard.

If I had to be picky then I would say, for the money you pay, the rooms are far too small.  We felt cramped.  Apart from that, lovely hotel and a lovely stay.",4,2015,08,27
115,Lovely hotel and a great location of London,"Came for a short visit, but pleased from the moment we checked in and were greeted with a refreshing drink on a very hot day!  Offered water when we would head out for the day.  Great breakfast at a reasonable price.  Smaller room with great amenities, only negative was the mattress sank in the middle.  ",4,2015,08,26
115,Absolutely Delightful,"Convenient location, nicely appointed room, very efficient room service, great full English breakfast, and polite staff. We were very near the British Museum, near the tube, and truly enjoyed the quiet location. Highly recommend.",5,2015,08,26
115,fantastic hotel great location,"me and my wife we just retured from 5 nights and evrething about this hotel its beautiful the location and the service from all the staff its great
the room was comfortable
and the location is excellent
i recommend this hotel to every one who wont to feel at home when he is out
i will came again of sure",5,2015,08,26
115,A great stay,"I spent two nights in this hotel. The location is very good, a few steps from the Oxford Street, Covent Garden, Holborn area. The underground Tottenham is at 5 minutes by foot. 
The staff is nice and professional, nothing to change! The hotel is clean, with a comfortable and quite luxurious atmosphere. 
The rooms are correctly soundproof, quite big for London (at least ours) and clean. 
The only thing to enhance is the bed, too soft and too small for us (140cm wide). But apart from that, I recommend this hotel and I will go back there. ",5,2015,08,26
115,Nice hotel but not for family room,We were put in a family room with 2 twins and a double. Not a great experience as felt like we were in a converted conference room. Only windows looked out over center well. Not great. Hotel was nice though and the room was quiet. Staff were helpful and it's in a great location.,4,2015,08,25
115,Afternoon tea,"my friend and I visited the Bloomsbury Hotel this time last year for afternoon tea and enjoyed it and the tea so much we went again this week over Harrods and The Ritz.  We were remembered by Joao who served us last year and had a good catch up with him.  Friendly staff, Elena our waitress helpful and accommodating and once again, first class sparkling afternoon tea. Thank you both.  We hope to see you again this time next year.",5,2015,08,25
115,"Very good afternoon tea but worse front desk service, please provide 2 umbrella per room","I had the afternoon tea for 2 days in a row. The cream tea set and the service of mr. Joao is very nice. The location is also very good.
 But the front desk service is so terrible. It was raining in morning, no one was at the concierge, i went to front desk and ask for an umbrella, the guy said i have to wait for the concierge so when the concierge came he said i had to get the umbrella in my room! Ok , my bad that i forgot the umbrella , but i didnt go back to my room becasue it was light rain. but i had to go out in the evening again, this time i look for the umbrella in my room but it wasnt in the room. I ask the front desk , the girl said it should be in the room, go look it up again if its not in the room, she will give me an umbrella !!!! Omg! Its just an umbrella!i felt very angry for very poor service.  I would give the hotel 1 star but no because mr. Joao was supernice, the team should give him a credit. ps. I went to my room again ,cant find the umbrella, she finally gave me the umbrella. Dont know her name but this girl doesnt have service mind at all.",3,2015,08,25
115,"Gorgeous Hotel, Great Location!","Everything about this hotel was beautiful. I highly recommend it to anyone going to London who has a medium-high budget. It was really close to the tube, staff was extremely helpful, and the room was super nice.",5,2015,08,24
115,Bloomsbury Hotel - the only place to stay in Central London,"I couldn't rate this hotel highly enough. Every time I visit, the customer service gets better and better, I feel like I'm visiting my own personal residence in London. An absolute must stay for London. Fab location and excellent service with stunning rooms & food. ",5,2015,08,24
115,Perfect Location,"We spent four nights at The Bloomsbury for our 25th anniversary. The hotel is just 5 minutes walking from Britsh Museum and Totteham Court tube station. You can easily walk to Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square and Soho. Breakfast is served in a nice area in the lower ground floor and you can find everything you wish from full Englisg breafast to fresh fruits and yogurts. We would love to come back again.",5,2015,08,23
115,"Fantastic hotel, will definitely return!","We have just returned from 2 nights at the bloomsbury hotel which I had booked for my friends birthday. The hotel was lovely, the staff were friendly and professional and the room was clean and comfortable. I had mentioned we were staying to celebrate a birthday and not long after we checked in cakes and a card were delivered to the room, it was a really nice gesture. The hotel is in a great central location as well. I would highly recommend this hotel and will be returning next time I'm staying in London!",5,2015,08,22
115,Excellent stay in London,"We had an excellent stay at The Bloomsbury,  all the staff were very friendly and couldn't be more helpful, the location is excellent for sightseeing or if you are going to the theatre as we did it is only a ten minute walk to Shaftesbury Avenue. 
      ",4,2015,08,22
115,Exceeded my expectations...,"Stayed for one night whilst attending a charity business dinner at the Ivy. From arrival was very impressed with the service from a hot towel when checking in to a bottle of water when checking out.  I had expected try another chain hotel where costs and corners were being continually cut, but no everything was in good order with friendly welcoming staff. Breakfast wax excellent, all high quality not the usual congealed buffet we have all come to expect. I would certainly stag again both for business and pleasure.",4,2015,08,20
115,"good location, very quiet hotel, some front desk staff lacking English proficiency, shower needs work","Ideally located, on side street just off Tottenham Road--good location from which to explore London.  Very quiet hotel--we were able to sleep very well due to quiet nature of hotel.  The chocolates at beside nightly were a nice touch.  The buffet breakfast was very good, albeit expensive.  
2 areas that could be improved: First, many of the staff persons at the front desk seemed to have limited English proficiency.  For us, this actually had financial ramifications, because a staff person apparently did not understand English well enough to give us accurate information about a financial transaction.  At other times, it simply made communication challenging.  Second, the shower area had only a tiny/partial glass wall--this resulted in the shower spray water going everywhere in the bathroom, despite (of course) turning the shower head in an optimal direction.  We therefore spent each morning mopping up after our showers.  It seems this could be readily addressed.",4,2015,08,20
115,"Pleasant, friendly hotel","The Bloomsbury hotel is well located, particularly if you want to visit the British Museum.  It is attractively decorated, well maintained, comfortable and clean.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  Our room was reasonably spacious and pleasant.  There were a few niggles - the tepee bed ordered for our son was not there, and we had to remind staff before it was put up.  However, the error was rectified quickly, and our son was otherwise made very welcome with small treats (e.g. a toy bear and some jelly beans).  We also had a problem with our bathroom sink draining incredibly slowly, which we reported on check-out.  Apart from those minor issues, we found the hotel extremely pleasant and comfortable, and felt we could trust the staff to be responsive and helpful.  ",4,2015,08,20
115,"Nice hotel, good location","This is a return trip for us at the Bloomsbury Hotel having found it to be very nice previously. We booked for a superior room which we had stayed in previously but when we went to our room it seemed tiny. I went and asked at the desk if it was a superior room or a standard room and they confirmed it was a superior. Luckily there were some others available and the duty manager showed us some alternatives which were much nicer.

The new room certainly felt bigger, and was very comfortable.

This hotel is ideal for exploring the Oxford Street area and Tottenham Court Road tube is only a couple of minutes walk away.",4,2015,08,19
115,Janice H,I treated my friends to help me celetrate my 60th birthday we had a fantastic time we found the staff to be friendly and attentive. The champagne was flowing and the afternoon tea experience was delightful. We were able to chat at ease in a comfortable and relaxed setting. Thank you for a wonderful afternoon.,5,2015,08,19
115,Afternoon Tea at The Bloomsbury Hotel London was superb!,"Joao is very helpful, polite and nice person. The overall service was very good. 
I think it would be good to have more sandwiches and less cakes for The Afternoon Tea. Overall service was very good and it was brilliant atmosphere. 

Highly recommended for anybody interested to attend for The Afternoon Tea experience.",5,2015,08,18
115,Fantastic afternoon tea treat,"Excellent afternoon tea with attentive service.  Flowing champagne and very yummy selection of sandwiches, scones and cakes. Our group felt that we were very well looked after and a great time was had by all.  Thank you",5,2015,08,18
115,"Misleading staff, unauthorized credit card charges, and no response to my email","We had a recent stay at the hotel on 10th August for 2 nights.  We are newlyweds.

 When we checked we were told our room was not ready (understandable, at 11am after we had come off a transatlantic flight from New York) and our room #424 (our original superior room that we had booked) was upgraded to a deluxe room #628 because I have a gold status with Expedia, where I made the booking.  Upon our return to collect our keys later in the day, we were given keys to #424 and told by a lady on the front desk that she downgraded our room back to #424 because in her opinion, it was a better room.  We had been promised a deluxe room and we asked for our promise of #628 which, upon first observations, was a much better and bigger room with a king bed as opposed to a queen.  This left a bad taste with us, as it felt very misleading to us that we were told we would be upgraded, and then suddenly downgraded because one of your staff felt #424 was better than #628.   It felt like a highly convoluted story and something didn't sound quite right.  Maybe they didn't want to give us an upgrade after all and changed their minds.  She proceeded to show us room #628 in person and kept telling us how it is not as good a room.  It felt like she was trying to talk us out of it and take our original room #424.  It felt very weird to us.  We felt as though we had been promised a deluxe room and then experienced a hard sell to talk us out of it and try to sneakily switch us back to our original room.  In hindsight, we now wonder if they made a mistake of upgrading us and then tried to back track to cover their error.

We liked #628.  It was a much bigger room with a bigger bathroom and it was fine.  It was a nice size room.   

The issue was the bed, which we took up with the hotel during our stay.  We went to bed after a full day of sightseeing, totally exhausted (also after a long haul flight) and we were both sinking into the bed to the point that we were dipping into it.  We tried for almost 2 hours to get comfortable....we flipped tha mattress upside down and even tried sleeping at the bottom of the bed.  I actually gave up and made a bed for myself on the floor at 2am.  The next morning we addressed the issue with the front desk.  They were nice and said it was a soft mattress, but it wasn't.  The frame of the bed was definitely not right and the bed clearly dipped in the middle. They tried to resolve the bed on day 2, but we didn't feel much of a difference.  In the end I just bought some sleeping pills and knocked myself out.  They left us choclates which was a nice touch, but by that point, we were so exhausted that we just didn't care.  All we wanted was a functioning bed or an offer to change our room for another one so we could get at least 1 decent nights sleep.  They didn't offer to change our room.  

Upon check out, the front desk staff apologized and said they would put a board on the bed to overcome the dipping....but this would have been an excellent solution that they could have done for our 2nd night, which would have resulted in us getting some decent sleep (which we didn't, because we were stuck with a dipping bed).  The choclates left for us in the room were a nice touch.  If a customer cannot sleep in a bed, at least offer to change their room immediately.  The hotel was not full.  This would have been possible.  

I really wanted to like this hotel.  The hotel itself is decorated nicely and it is in a good location.  The front desk staff are polite, but I feel like they lied to us about our upgrade and, although they claimed to try and fix our bed, we didn't feel any difference.  They should have just offered us another room instead.  We would never stay here again.  We feel very let down by the hotel.

We really, really wanted to like this hotel.  The front desk service was very professional, but the whole room switching incident sounded like a shady story and we just didn't trust the front desk staff from then on.

Upon check-out, the front desk manager told us that he would email us as a follow up regarding the bed (I don't exactly know why...).  

After we left, we checked our credit card statement, and there was an unauthorized charge for $93.25.  I immediately wrote an email to the hotel, but have not had a response.  Zip.  Nothing from them.

The decor of the hotel is beautiful....but that's about it.  Nothing else.

We won't be recommending this hotel and will be writing a review to this effect.  We would also like to know what the $93.25 charge was for.

Thankfully, our honeymoon is going much better, but our stay at the Bloomsbury got it off to a terrible start.  We didnt enjoy London as much as we should have done because we were just exhausted and sleep deprived from your uncomfortable bed.",2,2015,08,17
115,An actual cooked breakfast!!!,"Stayed here for two nights. Lovely hotel with pleasant, friendly staff. Nice, decent size bedroom with a very comfortable bed plus a good size bathroom with decent shower (over bath). Fabulous evening meal in the restaurant on the first night - I had the sea scallops, lamb chops and creme brûlée. For me though the cooked breakfast absolutely nailed it... I can't actually remember the last time I stayed anywhere where the breakfast was cooked to order... sheer bliss!
I will definitely stay here next time I'm in London.",5,2015,08,17
115,First Class Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for a theatre break and from the minute you walk through the door you are made to feel very special. The staff were extremely polite and helpful, the rooms were perfect in every way.

The location is great for the theatres just a 10 minute stroll from The Palace theatre and all the bars and restaurants.",5,2015,08,17
115,Fantastic ,A beautiful hotel.  Staff are very helpful and professional.   We had both breakfast and dinner over our 3 days and the food was delicious.  Great location.  Can't wait to come back.  Thank you all who made our stay so enjoyable. ,5,2015,08,16
115,Once again a brilliant stay.,"We've stayed at this hotel 8 times now and each time it's just lovely. The staff are always so welcoming, they remember us when we check in. The lovely manager at breakfast always remembers us. We met a delightful member of staff in the lobby restaurant who was chatting to us all about the history of the hotel, (I did ask my husband to get her name which he did, but unfortunately he's mislaid it ) as we wanted to mention her personally and also another lovely member of staff from Amsterdam who was doing a six month internship. The staff are a credit to this hotel and make it somewhere so nice to stay. That's why we always come  back. Thank you to you all.",5,2015,08,16
115,Great beginning to our Trip,"The Bloomsburty Hotel was the first of four hotels on a lengthy European vacation from Californiaa.  And, it could not have began any better.  The entire staff was incredibly helpful, but Brian, the concierge, assisted in making additional arrangements that made the start of our trip that much better.  The hotel grounds were fantastic from our room to the first-level bar and restaurant.  The restaurant staff and food was amazing.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone planning on staying in London for a short or long while.",5,2015,08,16
115,Superb lobby bar,"We stopped here for a drink when friends stayed at the hotel. The lobby bar is very quaint, the drinks were superbly served, the staff very attentive, and even table snacks provided. It felt very grand indeed. Definitely a nice place to spend some time. We briefly saw the restaurant, and that looked nice too, but we didn't try it.",5,2015,08,16
115,Great choice in August,"We are exceptionally pleased with the room and amenities at the Bloomsbury. We have enjoyed many summer trips to London and this rates as on of our favorites. Close to Tottenham Court Station and a few blocks from the British Museum, it is ideally located for the tourist. The service is professional, and the room are large. The beds are above average and the bathrooms are accommodating. We will return.",5,2015,08,16
115,Pleasant afternoon tea,"Nice (nearly) spur of the moment decision to go for afternoon tea. Reasonably priced with an Internet offer.

We sat out on the terrace and were well looked after by Joao and Manuela.

Strawberry's on the one of the cakes were particularly flavoursome.",4,2015,08,15
115,They bend over backward,"I really like the Bloomsbury Hotel.  It is a gorgeous property.  It's impressive, chic, and comfortable all at the same time.   The location s aso superb.  You are just around the corner from Oxford Street and steps from the British Museum.  My family used the hotel has a base for our all-over-London walking and exploring holiday this summer, and it proved the perfect setting.  But what makes the hotel fabulous isn't really it's physical appointments, or even its location.  It's the staff.   They are incredibly helpful  . . in so many ways.  My husband arried a few days after the rest of the family . . . very early in the morning.   The front desk didn't have him wait until 2 to check in . . . They found him a room that was available right then.  Tremendous.  That makes enormous difference when you're jet lagged.   . . .   And that's only one example of them really bending over backward to make us comfortable.  We'll be back.",4,2015,08,15
115,The best ever,This hotel is an excellent quaint facility.  The staff is phenomenal.  They go out of the way to make your stay extra special.  From the front desk when you walk in to the doorman you can't go wrong here. The location is superb.  I wish I had more time in this jewel.  I had an early morning flight before breakfast was served and they bought warm pastries to my room.  That's called over the top service!  Kudos and many thanks to all of them.,5,2015,08,14
115,The Bloomsbury Hotel,"Excellent hotel. Great value and location. The breakfast was amazing and the room, although small, was very comfortable. Staff was friendly and very helpful. Just make sure you verify and reservations make with the concierge, as we has a problem with our car reservation to the airport upon departure.

115,Very fine alfresco Afternoon Tea,"I took a friend for Unlimited Champagne Afternoon Tea, On a sunny afternoon we were shown onto the Terrace and greeting by our waiter who was charning and attantive without being overbaring. We were offered a wide selection of teas and were presented with sandwiches, the lightest scones i have eaten in years with jam and cream. The champagne kept coming , The only slight critisism was that the cakes were a little bit boring  but we were quite full by then anyway.",4,2015,08,13
115,Great visit to the Bloomsbury!,"We enjoyed our 3 day stay at the Bloomsbury.  Staff  and the manager were incredibly friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed seeing several of them many times. We stayed in the hotel while traveling with another couple. The hotel has able to get us rooms across the hall from each other, and it was fun to see another room in the hotel.  The rooms were different, but both excellent!  They are smaller and a little quirky roof lines, etc, but this is because the hotel is a historic building.  It use to be the YWCA in pre war times.  They give you a little book in your room about the history.  Very interesting.  The Queen has been to the Bloomsbury many times during it's lifetime.  We found the room clean and quiet, and we enjoyed the location on a quieter street just off the main street.  We absolutely loved the breakfast downstairs.  The restaurant is in the basement, but it is very well decorated and translates to very classy not at all what you think of as a basement.  The food was excellent, and we enjoyed the lattes and juice.  Overall, it was a wonderful stay and we would go back in a heart beat.   The restaurant in the hotel is also amazing, and absolutely don't miss having afternoon tea in the lobby or terrace.  I would recommend reservations. It was one of my favorite memories of London.  Love this place!",5,2015,08,12
115,Elegant and Convenient,"The Bloomsbury offers all the comforts of home in a neighborhood convenient to the best of London. The staff was excellent, location ideal to get about town, quick meals in Landseer bar fun and tasty. Overall, it's just a solid choice that gives you a pretty environment to operate from, a quiet and very comfortable night's sleep, and a feeling of approachable luxury that's very satisfying.",5,2015,08,11
115,Excellent!,"This is a beautiful hotel! Very clean, lovely staff, excellent service, very fresh food, a juice bar, afternoon tea, a relaxing and elegant lobby, coffee machine in the room, minibar and so on... It smells luxury.  The beds were really nice. The breakfast was not overloaded, but it didn't matter cause it was fresh. You can order fresh juice, English breakfast and salads, for an extra cost. I have nothing bad to say about The Bloomsbury Hotel. I've lived in a lot of hotels in London, and this is absolutely the best. I appreciated the terrace (who will be bigger any day). The area is perfect, near Oxford street, Soho and British Museum (on the same street). We will definitely be back!",5,2015,08,10
115,A family visit to London,"We spent 10 days at The Bloomsbury Hotel as we shoed our son's family of 5 the sights of London via a London Pass. We asked the concierge to help with reservations and show tickets, and he made the planning very easy for an extremely busy itinerary. The hotel was perfect, the food excellent, and the trip a marvelous success.",5,2015,08,10
115,My 5th visit to this great Hotel,"I do love the Bloomsbury In London The location is perfect for us, walking distance to the tube and to Covent garden. the staff are excellent, so well trained, and the breakfast is excellent. We particularly enjoyed the Avocado and tomato on Guinness toast. Unfortunately we were in London during the recent tube strike, which caused a few problems, but the staff couldn't have been more helpful in trying to solve our transport problems...............",5,2015,08,10
115,Superb,"An absolutely fabulous experience. Great staff friendly and helpful. Lovely room clean and comfortable would most defiantly re visit. Highly recommended
 We visited as a bday treat and a lovely slice of cake was waiting in our room with fresh fruit when we returned from our show. Nothing was too much trouble for the lovely staff.
      ",5,2015,08,10
115,Lovely Hotel,"Don't have a bad thing to say about this hotel, all of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, our room was clean and well equipped and the breakfast delicious. The location was perfect for all of the things we wanted to do, found we could easily walk rather than get on tube. Would thoroughly recommend to anyone and hope to stay again soon.",5,2015,08,10
115,A great welcome at the hotel reception.,"A great welcome at the reception.
The room was a little small but good and clean.
There wasn't enough daylight (for a 1 night stay not a great problem), a comfortable bed, the bathroom was ok.
wifi included!
the breakfast room and restaurant is located in lowgroundfloor and so there was just a little daylight coming throw the small windows. That's a pity on a summer morning.
The hotel is perfect located near the British Museum and the shopping streets. 
Covent garden is in a little distance.
It is also prima located for traveling by Eurostar. 
Close to underground and buses, excellent!
Without a  special rate the hotel price is expensive.

115,Friends visit london,"Hotel was lovely; rooms clean and comfortable though the beds on wheels cause some giggles.
Staff on reception very helpful : let us drop of luggage early and store it for us after checking out, also kindly booked our taxi to and from London zoo this was a great help as we were able to enjoy our day at the zoo knowing our luggage was safe and we had a taxi back pre booked.",4,2015,08,08
115,Excellent hotel highly recommended,"As soon as we arrived at the hotel we were welcomed by smiling staff who helped us with our luggage. The checkin operations were quick and smooth and were escorted to our room. Rooms are cosy and elegant, we did appreciate the Nespresso machine to have our coffe ready at any time of the day. The hotel is perfectly cleaned, the common areas are immaculate as are the rooms. I did appreciate the friendliness and kindness of the staff who were always available and ready to help. The location of the hotel is ideal to visit London's major highlights, the British Museum is very close as are the theaters of the West End and Oxford Street shopping area. We do recommend this hotel, our stay was very enjoyable and we are very likely to return. ",5,2015,08,08
115,Family Afternoon Tea,"We enjoyed a superb afternoon tea here just less than a week ago. Faultless food and service at an extremely good price in superb surroundings - a few days on and my wife and I still enjoy talking about it. We were joined by our late teens son who rarely strays from the tried and tested - an empty stand and contented look bore witness to the quality of fare on offer at the Bloomsbury. 
Nothing was to much trouble nor was the service intrusive - the staff have the balance just right. A return will most certainly be on the cards in the future.",5,2015,08,07
115,London trip with friends.,Our travel agent included this hotel with our London package. Great location and great service! The concierge was especially helpful with directions and recommendations for restaurants that we might enjoy.,5,2015,08,07
115,Lovely weekend break,"Just returned from a delightful stay at The Bloomsbury hotel. Couldn't fault it! Location means you can actually walk to most major attractions - especially theatres and Covent Garden. Much better than having to rely on the underground as you see so much more. Room perfect, as was breakfast. An ideal venue. 
      ",5,2015,08,07
115,Absolutely Stunning....!!!,"Just finished my four day stay checking out on 7th August. Sheer luxury at sensible prices.  Not cheap but this four star hotel is every inch a five star offering. And of course,  it is located just minutes from all the main theatres.  Soho and Covent Garden are all close by as is Leicester Square.  
 Egyptian cotton adorn the beds in the superb bedrooms all with complimentary dressing gowns and slippers.  N Espresso coffee machines provided and complimentary still and sparkling bottled waters. Spotless throughout. 
Breakfast was a joy.  Delicious coffee with a heavy crema and a grease-free full English breakfast.  I think even the toast was designer. I didn't try the main menu in the restaurant during my four day stay but the menu looked exciting,  varied and fresh. 
Staff were first class.  Polite,  friendly and nothing too much trouble. Outstanding! 
What a hotel!!  I have travelled the world and few come close to the high standards of this excellent Bloomsbury Hotel on Great Russell Street in London. 
Well done.",5,2015,08,06
115,Great for a short London family trip,"Excellent Hotel. Service very friendly and supportive. Beautiful building, nicely maintained. Location certainly unbeatable (bus 24 takes you directly to embankment and metro / british museum is two minutes around the corner).
Room was nicely furnished and in good shape. If you order full breakfast you can choose the hot food from the menu and its freshly prepared - way better than the usual buffet breakfast that has everything sitting on the counter lukewarm. Coffee was always nespresso - very nice. Very attentive staff regarding special arrangements, nice welcome gift for our 8-year old daughter and great transport service back to heathrow for a reasonable price. Truly one of the best city trip experiences for us - thank you Bloomsbury Hotel people.",5,2015,08,06
115,Birthday celebrations! ,"Such an amazing weekend in a beautiful hotel. Upon arrival staff were really friendly and made sure we had everything we needed and the concierge was very helpful. Arriving in the room there was a beautiful (in taste and decoration) Victoria sponge birthday cake waiting for me along with a card which was a wonderful gesture. The rooms are very modern, nicely decorated and spacious. Hotel is extremely close to oxford street, Covent Garden, soho! 
Overall a brilliant weekend and would definitely recommend it to anyone wishing to stay in the heart of London.",5,2015,08,05
115,Pretty flawless,"Visited towards the end of July with my girlfriend and we were both extremely happy with the hotel. Fantastic location, very accessible and close proximity to everything you want to do. 
The staff we're a delight, always polite, helpful and very well turned out. 
The restaurant and bar, both staffed by a charming young man during our visit, were fantastic. The option for a pre-theatre dinner was there although we didn't take it.
Our room was comfortable and well appointed, comfy bed and a good shower. 
Thank you once again to the staff. We will be returning. ",5,2015,08,05
115,Wedding anniversary treat,we have just had a two night stay at the hotel to celebrate our tenth wedding anniversary. The staff were wonderful and they made our stay very special. We had a very good meal in the hotel restaurant completed with a cake presented to us with an anniversary message. The room was decorated with towels made into swan shapes it was a lovely touch,5,2015,08,04
115,"Great location, but not sure hotel is worth the $$$","Our room was comfortably appointed, booking process was super easy, but although it was a nice hotel, it didn't feel 'extra special' in any way.  The location was fantastic! The Bloomsbury is a short and easy walk to Seven Dials and Covent Garden, which made it very easy to find a good dining option.

Tips for Seven Dials & Covent Garden:  Skip Monmouth Coffee and go to Timberyard (much more comfortable, free Wi-fi, and a great selection of tasty treats).  Visit Neal's Yard - quirky and cute.  Take a backstage tour of the Royal Opera House - it's worth it.",3,2015,08,03
115,Trip to Ronnie Scott's,"We chose this hotel for its proximity to Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club. What a treat we've had. With the central line not stopping at Tottenham Court Road at the moment we travelled mainly on the Bakerloo line on a very warm day! The hot towel on arrival in the hotel was therefore extremely welcome!! Our room was lovely. Clean bright well prepared and very comfortable we freshened up and headed to the lounge for a glass of bubbly. Or two!  Nothing was too much trouble, the hotel is just how I like them. Not too high, polite staff, well trained and well turned out they do the hotel proud. Excellent value for money for central London and cheaper than a Travelodge I used recently. Well placed for shopping and theatre. 
Superb experience.",5,2015,08,03
115,"Good hotel, great staff",The Bloomsbury is nice inside but the courteousness of the staff stands out the most. Everything went smoothly at the front desk. Even better was the hotel bar. The bartender Joe continually went above and beyond the call of good service to make sure we were satisfied. Even the maintenance man who was called out of bed after midnight to fix a water problem was friendly with us. I will definitely book the Bloomsbury for my next business trip in London.,5,2015,08,03
115,Great place away from home in top location.,"After my 'not so good last stay' here, I was quite eager to try this hotel again to see if things had changed for the better. Although it is still possible to get into the hotel without much bother, or key card access to the elevator, it seemed there was much more staff on hand than last time. This is reassuring!
The room itself is excellent, with all facilities on hand that you would expect from a 5 star hotel in London. Staff was charming and eager to please. Any minor problem is quickly set straight and so it makes for a quite relaxed stay.
I'm happy to recommend the hotel as I do feel things have improved and of course, the location cannot be beaten!",4,2015,08,03
115,Lovely hotel,"Bloomsbury is lively neighborhood, close to many conveniences, but the hotel is very quiet and quite luxurious.  Great attention to detail in all matters, but that also means that you can't check a little early (even when exhausted from an overnight flight) unless the room is perfect.  The heated tiles in the bathroom are always a treat, and the bed was heavenly.  A lovey stay",5,2015,08,02
115,Treat,"stayed at the Bloomsbury hotel for a night in November 2014 ahead of the ATP World Tour Finals at the O2. The location is pretty much perfect. A stone’s throw from the British Museum, short walk to the train stations and near all the fabulous restaurants and bars. Check in was quick and painless with staff engaging us in conversation. We were shown to our room which wasn’t huge but more than sufficient. The bed was so comfortable; I could have spent the rest of my day just snuggling down in it. My partner was super happy that there was an Nespresso coffee machine in the room and he made it his mission to try all of the different pod flavours. I loved the Aromatherapy Associates toiletries in the bathroom, one of my favourite brands.",4,2015,08,02
115,"Lovely hotel, good location","My husband and I stayed here for the weekend and enjoyed it very much. Like many large hotels it can feel impersonal at times but the staff were always courteous and friendly. The reception area and lobby are fitted out in that Old World, deep red style that I like while our room was bright and very well laid-out, making a small space feel spacious. The location is great, an easy walk to Covent Garden and Oxford Street and close to Tottenham Court Rd tube. It's a little pricey for what you get but that's London prices for you. Overall, recommended. ",4,2015,08,02
115,Extraordinary Service; Great Accomodations,"From the moment we arrived for our 4 night stay, my wife and I were made to feel as if we lived at the Bloomsbury.  At check in we asked if we could get a king size bed instead of the queen that we had booked and it was found and provided at no additional cost (and it was far more comfortable than our bed at home).  The room was spacious, comfortable and quiet.  The hotel is very well located for walking (short walk to Regents Park) and the Metro (Tottenham Court Station a block away).

The fitness center was better than most of the hotels of this size, providing sufficient weight machines and cardio.  The bar, a lovely place to have a drink and a restaurant with great service and food.

And all of this at a most reasonable price for London.  Would stay again in a heartbeat.",5,2015,07,31
115,Wedding Anniversary,"To celebrate our wedding anniversary, we booked into our 'home from home' The Bloomsbury Hotel. We have stayed here many times before and it never disappoints. It just gets better and better. The staff couldn't be more welcoming and helpful. We arrived early enough for a delicious light lunch in the Lutyens Lounge. Then we took a casual walk around the famous department stores near by. In the evening we chilled out in our fabulous suite, simply basking in the luxury of the room. Then down to the cocktail bar and into the restaurant for an outstanding dinner. The staff could not have been more efficient or nicer, they all made the occasion very special indeed. We shall return.",5,2015,07,31
115,"Great location, proper service, nice character","This is a gem of a hotel a block or so from Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street. Charing Cross Road is 2 minutes away, as is the British Museum. Plenty of pubs and restaurants nearby. Prime spot to base yourself for whatever you are doing in London. The service was courteous and helpful, the restaurant was excellent and the room (for a family of 5) was clean and spacious. After the hustle of the nearby streets this was a pleasant escape. I recommend a nightcap at the bar too. 
Overall we were very happy with our brief stay and will try to stay again next time we are back in London.",5,2015,07,30
115,Fantastic location for Central London,"First and foremost, the location of this hotel is fantastic. 30 seconds from Tottenham Court Road tube station, right by Oxford Road and within 10 minutes walking distance of Soho, Leicester Square, The British Museum and Covent Garden. The hotel itself is also really lovely. Public areas are well presented and my room was very nice.Most staff I encountered were also very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would certainly return again.",5,2015,07,30
115,Great setting for afternoon tea,"Birthday treat!! On arrival was told no booking but  after a few minutes booking was found and we were seated on a lovely comfy sofa, tea was ordered with a glass of fizz had plenty of finger sandwiches gorgeous warm scones and a good selection of other cakes so much we took the rest home!",4,2015,07,29
115,Just wonderful!,"Enjoyed a weekend stay for our wedding anniversary. Upgraded to a junior suite on arrival. Flowers, champagne and a cake delivered to our room. Great service from all the staff. Superb breakfast. A truly wonderful hotel in the middle of London.",5,2015,07,29
115,Great location,I chose this hotel due to its perfect location and perfect it was. Very close to Coventry garden and Oxford st and lots of transportation links to other parts of the city. As for the hotel. staff very friendly superior room was good size . room was clean. Two things you should take in mind: 1)if you like trendy new hotels( as I do) this is not the hotel for you it's more like an old world classy hotel but I knew it so no complaints here. 2) my room had a  small maintenance problem in the bathroom ( water in the tub did not run down properly so when you take a shower you stand in sort of a pool) there was an attempt to fix it but it didn't help. The reception did offer to change the room but I didn't want to pack and decided to stay with the problem,4,2015,07,29
115,Sophisticated and Pleasant,"Fabulous hotel in great location close to Oxford Street and west end theatres.  The decor is sophisticated and modern with a great atmosphere.  Reception very friendly and helpful, although did try to upsell with room upgrade and pay £18 for breakfast.  I was tired and so accepted the breakfast as she said it would cost more if I just turned up in the morning.  My second morning I just walked across the road and had a £7 breakfast which was perfect.  But putting that aside the concierge was most helpful in getting taxis for me and the whole experience was very good.  The room was clean, comfortable and a touch of sophistication.  Dinner in the in house restaurant was excellent.  I would definitely stay again.",5,2015,07,28
115,An inspiring wedding venue!,"We had the most incredible reception here. We had a small party (20) and chose to eat in the Seamus Heaney library.... The table was set exquisitely and when the food came this was no ordinary wedding meal... It was the finest of foods and the service came with beautiful wines as part of the silk package we had booked. We also had use of the chapel so after dinner guests spilled into there and had access to a bar and breakout areas. The decor was really inspiring and presentation was amazing. Nothing was too much trouble and Pilar our wedding organiser deserved a medal for her positive can-do approach! The wedding suite, which came as part of the package, was beautiful with a large bed and his and her sinks, walk in rainforest shower wet room and roll top bath and wall set TV.... attached in an open plan bathroom. Prices were good for what is a very very high quality venue. Larger rooms could cater for bigger weddings too but we would urge anyone looking for a venue to consider it!!",5,2015,07,28
115,Lovely weekend break at this hotel,"Stayed at the Bloomsbury for two nights in London, lovely reception with hot towels & juice offered, room was lovely, although the view was not, looked out onto side street & ugly building opposite, enjoyed the Nespresso coffee machine in room,  nice touch. Booked the hotel restaurant for evening dinner, which was amazing service & food. Breakfast was included & again was amazing service & delicious well equipped buffet, I had poached eggs on toast which were the best I've ever had! A big Thank you to Estelita who was both courteous and efficient, a real lovely lady. Would definetely visit again",5,2015,07,28
115,Well rounded business hotel and good for sightseeing,"I stayed four nights on business during the work week and the hotel provided a good balance of comfort, location, and value.  It is very close to the British Museum, Regents Park, and other great spots in central London.  The room was moderate in size overall with adequate closet space which helped maximize the space. The bathroom was also moderate in size and well appointed.  The bed was comfy which is key for me. The key is the shower which was okay. I always find the half glass enclosure odd.  Overall is way a great stay with only one minor hiccup in delayed room service but management was prompt in their apology and willingness to correct it on a future visit.",4,2015,07,27
115,Birthday celebration with wife,"A special mention to Louise, who kindly arranged for me to have a dairy free birthday cake and Joel who served us  in the bar. Joel was both attentive and passionate about his job. We will definitely return!",5,2015,07,27
115,Weekend stay at The Bloomsbury,"This is the second time we have stayed at The Bloomsbury. An excellent hotel. Friendly, courteous and very helpful staff. Very clean and superb facilities. It is also conveniently located for all access to Central London attractions. Thoroughly recommended.",5,2015,07,27
115,Excellent Hotel,"My overall experience was exceptional and I would stay again. The room and amenities were terrific, especially the coffee and tea! The hotel is perfectly located, only a five-minute walk to the British Mueum and the Underground. The front desk staff were friendly and polite, and the concier was helpful with directions.

My only comment is that the breakfast was quite expensive and unremarkable. For over 18 pounds, I expected a bit more selection. The restaurant staff, with the exception of one person, was unimpressive. They basically ignored me and my partner. There are plenty of restaurants serving breakfast so it wasn't a problem finding a spot.  We ate breakfast across the street for a third of the price and the food was delicious.

That said, I would stay there again without hesitation! The location is excellent and the hotel is a winner!",5,2015,07,26
115,Honeymoon in London,"The Bloomsbury was in a great location - close to theatres, shopping and a starting point for major tourist attractions.  It is a really neat building with an interesting history and is quite beautiful.  Lobby area is gorgeous.  Very attentive service, especially with the concierge.",5,2015,07,26
115,Well done!!!,"Just back from 3 nights stay at The Bloomsbury....We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to both Onar and Louise. Our luggage zipper burst when we are about to checkout of the hotel. In a panic mode, we called the front desk and Louise came to our room immediately to assist us and called Maintenace dept to asked for a strongest tape to wrap our luggage. Onar came to our aid swiftly and help us to seal  our luggage enable us to  proceed to the airport at ease.  He also gave us the remaining tape to us in case we need it. So thoughtful of him.  We thanks him for the kind help.
Overall this hotel located at a very strategic location, Tottenham tube station few mins walk, buses can be reached to local attractions. Sainabury, Morrisons supermarket within few mins walk. Finally daily breakfast is awesome...! 
We will be back!!! Cheers:)
",5,2015,07,26
115,"Excellent hotel, great location","Excellent hotel! Great location central London, just round the corner from the tube at Tottenham Court Rd and Dominion theatre. Lovely oasis in the city. Great service from the doormen to the household staff and everyone in between. As it was our silver wedding anniversary they decorated our room with rose petals, and gave us strawberries and chocolates. There was even a card! Lovely surprise when we returned back at night! Great breakfast. And excellent service. Look out for Estelita in the breakfast room, lovely lady! Not the cheapest hotel, but if you want a nice hotel in a great location then look no further. We would definitely go back there!",5,2015,07,26
115,First time in London!,"This was our first time in London and we were very happy that we chose The Bloomsbury Hotel in London. This hotel exceeded our expectations in every way. The entire staff were very friendly and went out of their way to meet our every need. They take pride in their customer service and it shows.  The restaurant, lounge and bar are all very nicely decorated.  Our room was very clean and comfortable with high quality linens and furnishings. We had a King room and it was very nice indeed. The food is delicious, a great selection of drink offerings in the bar and most importantly, exceptional staff. We hated to leave but rest assured,  we will stay there again on a return trip. We highly recommend this hotel. Especially to anyone who would like to stay near the British Museum as it is a very short walk to get there.  You can't beat the location. The Afternoon Tea is a must as well. What a luxurious treat with English scones and wonderful teas that are out of this world.  We just can't say enough about this gem of a hotel. You have to try it to believe it.  You won't be disappointed... ",5,2015,07,25
115,"Great Location, Near Euston, Posh Feel","Good:
Stayed 3 night, Room 103, Good size bedroom, Not great view from window, Decent sized bathroom - clean. 

Room service is great - Peri peri chips are a good choice. 

Not So Good:
£4.50 delivery charge for room service - was not aware of this extra charge",4,2015,07,23
115,Fantastic food and customer service!!,"Recently stayed at this hotel for a 2 night stay with my fiancé. After quite a major blip on arrival, the staff quickly took responsibility and made our stay a memorable one (for all the right reasons!!!!) The matter in question was dealt with very professionally and being treated to a special meal courtesy of the hotel was just one of the lovely things they did for us to make up for the situation. We really appreciate what Louise did for us during our stay- we really cant thank her enough for her attention and caring attitude during what was a very stressful day tracking and collecting our Ed Sheeran tickets in time for the concert. A special mention to Jaou who made us feel at home with his very welcoming and friendly personality. He even had a special chocolate dessert made for us!!! We would definitely return due to the great location, great staff (especially Louise and Jaou) and the FANTASTIC food!!!",4,2015,07,22
115,one night stay,"this hotel was so lovely right up there with the best i have stayed in, staff so polite and happy always a smile for you, would stay again. We used it for dominion theatre just round the corner from hotel, had a cream tea which was very good and a good price. 
      ",5,2015,07,22
115,enjoyable stay in London,"from the moment we walked in the staff were helpful and courteous, hotel was well appointed, room was excellent. Only stayed one night as we were going to a concert, but will definitely stay again the next time we are in London.",5,2015,07,21
115,Very nice hotel with well appointed rooms,A very high quality hotel just set far enough aside from busy oxford street.  The room was to a very high standard as was the bathroom.  You even get your own nespresso coffee maker.  I wouldn't hesitate in returning to this hotel.,4,2015,07,21
115,"Quiet, comfortable and close to everything","The check-in process was very smooth and I was able to go straight to my room, which was well-appointed and had everything I needed during my last-minute business trip. The staff was always helpful and gave excellent recommendations for eateries in the area. I already recommended the hotel to a friend and plan to stay there if I return to London.",5,2015,07,20
115,Afternoon Tea with American friends,"Giving visiting American friends the true English introduction - afternoon tea in a luxury London hotel.  We had a party of 9 and could easily book that at the Bloomsbury.  As we walked through the front door, we were straightaway recognised as the party of 9 and directed downstairs to the Landseer restaurant.  A positive welcome at the Landseer, seated very comfortably, and quickly served with a delightful afternoon tea.  Beautifully shining silver teapots.  Lovely table settings.  Great selection of sandwiches, scones (fruit and plain), fruit cake, and a load of sweet cakes and panacotta / conserve / fruit.  Really really tasty and a great price.  We loved it and had loads of time to chat with our colonial friends.  A fun way to spend a Sunday afternoon in a lovely hotel.",5,2015,07,19
115,Nice hotel in good location ,"Nice hotel in a great location right near Tottenham Court Road station. There is a lot of building works in the surrounding area, but this didn't effect the standard of the hotel. We were in an accessible room as our room was not ready(we were checking in earlier than the time). Reasonable size room, bathroom was massive. Beds turned down in the evening and robe and slippers placed on bed. Had a few drinks in the bar and Alex was a lovely bar man. Overall lovely stay.",4,2015,07,19
115,Wonderful stay!,"A lovely, very welcoming and extremely pleasant stay, the only downside was that it was for only one night! We stayed in room 515 which was dual aspect, very bright and quiet and perfect for our getaway. The staff couldn't have been more accommodating, especially Maria and the team at breakfast (which was amazing) who were very friendly and made sure our every need was catered for. Would definitely stay again, highly recommended!",5,2015,07,19
115,Most Gracious Hotel,"From the moment we arrived, we were treated wonderfully. Rooms were clean, stocked and comfortable. I had a serious fall our first evening in London, and upon returning from the emergency care, every staff member was so concerned. They provided us ice at all hours of the night and day, helped my family find the tube and busses, sent me a wonderful breakfast the next morning, and took care of calling all of our arranged tours and transport for the week. I can't say enough good things about this hotel!",5,2015,07,19
115,The Bloomsbury hotel is still up there with the best,"Once again we spent eight nights at the Bloomsbury Hotel in Grt Russell st, London.  Whatever we wanted was there for us, theatre tickets, advice on days out, directions to places we wanted to go.  It has been two years since we were there but we were welcomed back as if we had stayed last week.  Brian, Head Conscierge, leads a fabulous team of caring and dedicated people who go to great lengths to make a stay at this hotel wonderful.  Try the high tea option.",5,2015,07,19
115,Lovely Joel the Barman!!,"I was here a couple of weeks ago with a friend who was staying at the hotel. 

Joel was working in one of the bars (I forgot the name) and he was so lovely! A super great guy who really looked after us. 

I will definitely be coming back, lovely bar, with yummy cocktails :)",5,2015,07,18
115,Enjoyable stay,"We stayed for one night on a sight-seeing trip. The hotel was very well presented and had a certain charm to it as a result.  

Our room was quiet for Central London, as the hotel is just off a busy street. The view was non-existent, which wasn't necessarily a problem... the benefits of being so close to many of the London sights far outweighs things like that.

The bathroom and other facilities were clean and most definitely to a 4 star standard. I'd rate the room service/turn-down service to be excellent and worthy of 5 stars.",4,2015,07,18
115,My home away from home,"I had an opportunity to accompany my husband on business to London and we stayed at this fabulous hotel.
This wonderful hotel was formerly the site of the YWCA in London. The building was commissioned by Queen Mary in 1n 1924 and  designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. When one walks into the front door you feel like you have entered a place of significance.  The interior is beautiful but tasteful.  The lobby is welcoming and comfortable.  Some of Sir Lutyens furniture design reproductions, the Napoleon Chair, Spiderback Chair and Console Table. Of course I had to sit in each chair!  I really like them all. The Staff is exceptional! They are friendly, helpful and accommodating. The Concierge are quite knowledgeable and efficient. The rooms are luxurious and beautifully appointed. The rooms are exceptionally clean and you feel like you are the first person to stay in each one. The lighting and outlets are generous. Having spent many nights traveling in Europe I can say that they provide one of the best tea/coffee service in the rooms. They are also generous with the complimentary water and the towels are fluffy not like some hotels where they feel like sandpaper. We spent 10 days here using this as our base while we traveled to other countries for a night on business but always felt a relief coming back to this place.  Along with a beautiful bar on the lower level and restaurant they have a lovely juice bar on the main floor, where they will prepare a variety of healthy smoothie options and a very stylish salon  as well as outdoor patio to enjoy formal tea.  The hotel is located near the theatre district as well as a short walk to Covent Garden, Soho and The British Museum.  There are several tube spots near by.  We have really enjoyed staying here and I am sure we will be back the next time we visit London.",5,2015,07,18
115,"Beautiful hotel, with lovely staff!","I was already exited to stay here just by looking online. It's so close to everything! But when you get there your greeted by very welcoming door men, then the lovely lady at reception, check in was fast and smooth. It was the little extras that took it to the next level, the warm towel on arrival, the coffee machine in the room and the fact that if you need anything the staff will make it happen for you.
The bedroom was of a good size, large enough for what you need, the bed was so comfy. And the hotel was very quite at night, despite being so central. 
Overall I was blown away by my stay.

The food in the hotel was of a very good standard. The evening a la carte menu was the best, I would recommend the crispy hens egg with mushroom, and for main I really enjoyed the corn fed chicken with mash, port sauce and truffle.
In fact everything was of a really high standered in the restaurant, the service was impeccable, not overbearing but attentive. 

I'd come back timrrow!",5,2015,07,14
115,Nice Hotel in London,When you first walk in to the Bloomsbury Hotel you get this air of greatness. It's lobby is beautiful and well managed. When I got to my room I thought it was very nice. It was a single double room and the size was perfect. Initially I had problems checking in but the staff made every effort to get me squared awhile. They offered juice and a hot towel while I waited. The gym was perfect for those who need to work out on there business or personal time.,5,2015,07,14
115,I actually overslept one night,"Excellent location, very close to British Museum and the West End shops. Quite stylish and of superb quality. The best nights sleep I have ever had in a London hotel. Nearest tube station is closed for rebuilding, which is a little inconvenient.",5,2015,07,14
115,Cute London hotel,"Friendly and helpful staff. Nice location. Restaurants nearby. Price was reasonable. Clean room. Safe hotel. Modern decor. 

Downside: walls are a bit thin, room was a bit tight for two females sharing a double twin room, no room for toiletries/cosmetics in the bathroom. And the toilet handle in the bathroom was broken. 

Overall, I would stay there again but in a bigger room.",4,2015,07,13
115,You have to try the afternoon tea,"For a recent birthday I found a good deal online for afternoon tea here. We did go on a Tuesday, so can't comment about weekend experience. But I have to say the afternoon tea was excellent. I'd even put it up there with the likes of the savoy. Ok, it's not as formal or grand, but I actually preferred this. 

The food was very tasty, good variety, and plenty of it. The tea was topped up a few times.  

But the best bit was the price, it was less than half the cost of the big shots like the ritz!! 

So don't assume you'll get the best experience with the well known places, I'd definitely say give this a  try!",5,2015,07,13
115,Great Location and Service,"The second time I have stayed at this hotel for business, and on each occasion the standards of service were excellent.  The rooms were extremely comfortable and very well presented.  The staff were all very polite, professional and helpful.  The attention to detail top ensure that you receive 5 star service is excellent.   I would recommend this hotel to anybody for both business or leisure.",5,2015,07,13
115,It was disappointing.,"Great Location, Lovely decor.

We stayed as a birthday present to my other half. They were informed at booking and didn't acknowledge that in any way. Even making some conversation during check in would have been nice. Staff didn't make us feel very welcome really at all. 

The bed was dipped in the middle so although it was a nice bed with nice sheets etc me and my partner spent the night rolling in to each other in the middle of the bed.We stayed in a 'superior' room, I couldn't tell what was more 'Superior' than what I would have expected from a standard room. We were room only so I can't comment on any food but the mini bar prices we steep and so we avoided that. 
It had a nice feel to the place but to be honest for one night stay it really wasn't worth the £250+ paid just to sleep particularly as the bed was sunk in the middle. 

We don't normally get to spend that sort of money on a hotel so we really wanted it to be special and it wasn't. 

Wish we'd have stayed in a standard chain type hotel and spent the rest of the money on something special to do during the day.

Oh and not that it mattered too much but the 'complimentary wifi' didn't work.",3,2015,07,13
115,Good location; great service,"This was just an overnight stay when we took in a show in London but it was great. The hotel has obviously put attention to training staff and it shows - friendly and good service from reception to restaurants.
The room was very well equipped and comfortable and the general quality of the hotel / furnishings etc are very good - free wifi is a plus. A five minute walk from Tottenham Court Tube station makes this a great central location. I'd definitely stay here again.",4,2015,07,12
115,London for a few nights,London hotels aren't cheap. And we all know you can't swing a cat in the room. I was hoping this one would be a little different but it did disappoint on a couple of levels.  The room was so small it was difficult to walk around the other side of the bed. There was a panel on the wall which housed the airconditioning or like that came loose while we were there (they did fix it once notified). It is in a great part of town and the service was good as well....saying that I think we could have done better for the price.,3,2015,07,12
115,Great night up in town,Birthday surprise to see Beautiful ( Carole King Musical) at the Aldwych. Chose the hotel primarily on location as 20 minute walk away and late availability price. The hotel exceeded every expectation. It was truly a special place to stay up in town. I would recommend it to anyone.,5,2015,07,12
115,"Very comfortable hotel in a fantastic location, but not cheap","We took our daughter on a treat to London while her brother was away on a trip. We chose this hotel on the basis of its location which is fantastic, within easy walking distance of the West End, Covent Garden, Soho, British Museum, and other attractions. The staff were very welcoming, the communal areas excellent, and the room was clean, comfortable, and well-decorated. 

There were a few downsides - they didn't spoil our enjoyment but are worth mentioning. In order to accommodate a child bed for our daughter we had to upgrade to a higher level of room. This was significantly more expensive, but it was still not a large room, in the attic with just two small skylights. The over-bath shower was quite cramped. Breakfast was very expensive (we went to the excellent VQ cafe over the road instead), and the free wi-fi was very slow.

Nevertheless, we very much enjoyed our stay, and if we were able to get a better price would love to return.",4,2015,07,12
115,"Great hotel, great location","Very comfortable room, great staff and grand public spaces. This is a really nice hotel conveniently situated for shopping, theatres, sightseeing and Chinatown. Tottenham Court Road tube station is very near and there are absolutely loads of eating and drinking places in all directions. British Museum is 5 mins walk, National Gallery is 15 mins, Oxford Street is 2 mins. Safe to wander around at night.

If the mini bar prices are too high for you, there's an off licence less than twenty yards away in the direction of TCR.

I will stay here again.",5,2015,07,11
115,"Comfortable room, nice staff & great location","Although there was a delay with my check in, Staff were genuinely apologetic and upgraded my room.
Room was nicely decorated (more homely than other LDN hotels) and I slept better than in any other London Hotel due to quietness. (Kudos for the Aromatherapy Associates Toiletries).
Didn't eat in the hotel but availed of the fresh juices from the Juicery in the Lobby which were delicious. 
Really convenient location within walking distance of Convent Garden, Oxford St etc. 
Will be back.",4,2015,07,11
115,Very comfortable ,"Other than a grumpy unhelpful man on front desk when I  arrived 7AM after a 30 hour flight from Australia the hotel is beautiful & the service very good. It would have been better if i didnt have to pay 5£ ($10 aus) for a cup of black tea (tea bag) while i waited 3 hours .There was eventually  a room available  when I  enquired at 10.30 AM. The concierge was very helpful in booking us a dinner later in Covent Garden . London is very busy at the moment with a tube strike & lovely warm weather. Hard to get a booking. My room service breakfast was good , a lovely tray with a flower. My standard room is very comfortable  & cosy with ample space for 2 people. ",4,2015,07,10
115,First class hotel,"This is where we'll be staying in London in future. For many years we stayed at a comparably priced hotel not far away - but decided to try The Bloomsbury for a change. Restaurant food is first class, staff are friendly and very helpful. The bathroom in our suite was as large as many hotel bedrooms!  Lighting in both bedroom and bathroom is excellent (a common weakness in many hotels!). Yes, we'll definitely be back!",5,2015,07,10
115,A touch of class,"I normally stay at My Hotel Bloomsbury in London on Bayley St.  It wasn't available due to Wimbledon 2015.  Booked into the significantly more expensive (nearly twice the price but less than 500 metres away!) Bloomsbury Hotel.  Everything about the hotel is expensive.  Lobby is luxurious.  Old fashioned but oozes quality.  Bedrooms are adequate size - not that large, quite dark.  Decor is not bright or contemporary but that is not the USP of this hotel.  Bed was incredibly comfortable.  The wireless is THE fastest wireless connection I've ever used (even though my office has Fluidata which is very fast).  Comfortable stay though and the staff were friendly.  Location is very close to Centre Point so ideal.  

Would I stay again?  If money was no object yes indeed.  Didn't like the darkness of the hotel as a whole and not sure it is really value for money with other very good hotels close by at half the price but it was a nice bit of luxury and if you are wealthy it is quiet, quality and you will not be disappointed.",4,2015,07,09
115,Landseer Restaurant in the Hotel,"Excellent service in the landseer Restaurant the food was cooked and presented to perfection The waiters were extremely polite and didnt pester throughtout our meal.

We were seated straight away to a well laid table and made to feel comfortable immediately.
I can't fault them at all well done Landseer.

My wife and I only used the restaurant for a pre theatre dinner.",5,2015,07,07
115,Luxury hotel,This hotel is on a quiet road but is within 5mins walk to Oxford Street.I stayed here with a friend as we were going to Dominian theatre which is literally around the corner.Tottenham tube station is within 4mins walk.We had a twin room on the 4th floor facing the street it had blackout curtains with a mesh type blind and opening sash window.On arrival we were met by charming and very pleasant staff and checking in was quick.Our room was luxurious and the bed linen was so fresh and soft.We had booked for continental breakfast which was more than enough..plenty of it!We didnt have dinner there but that was more due to time.Lovely hotel and would definetly stay here again.,4,2015,07,06
115,Wow...that was unexpected!,"We weren't expecting it to be so beautiful and high end.
Here is a quick list of why my wife and I were delightfully surprised:

1) the best hotel breakfast we've ever had (the ""continental"" is enough but the full breakfast was WOW!)
2) the young woman at the Reception desk was from Romania. When she heard that we would be visiting her home country, she wrote us a personal note with helpful cultural and language tips and a blog post that she'd written about Romanian history.
3) the hotel is 100 steps or less from the British Museum. The Seven Dials, SOHO, Tottenham Court and other interesting areas are within a 5 or 10 minute walk
4) the rooms are tastefully luxurious with an impressive tech charging bar at the desk, large flat screen TV, sizeable closet, and both a hot water kettle for tea and a Nespresso coffee maker (with lots of little extras like cookies and chocolates).

(note: we had a standard room for 2 people w/ king size bed)",5,2015,07,05
115,Amazing hotel,"Me and my fiancé have stayed here about 3 times for birthdays, anniversary and Valentine's Day 
It's a great central located hotel just a stones throw away from Oxford street where there is loads of great shops",5,2015,07,05
115,Feeling spoilt,"The hotel is situated perfectly - it is very close to the West End but is on a lovely quiet road so we were able to walk to the theatre but not have to contend with any traffic noise when trying to sleep. We had a great welcome upon arrival and service was superb. The hotel and room was well furnished with excellent toiletries and sumptuous towels. The breakfast was very good with some very good options for people wanting a healthy start to the day, but also indulgences for those wanting a special treat. The breakfast was not included in the cost of the room, but there was a special offer for the breakfast the day we were there. We had such a lovely stay at the Bloomsbury and the only regret was that we only spent one night. We will certainly be staying there again!",5,2015,07,05
115,Excellent breakfast dining experience,"The Bloomsbury's Landseer restaurant has an exceptional continental breakfast dining experience. The array of food offered was excellent in quality with many tasty things to choose from. Maria, Estelita & Maya were friendly staff who learned my name and dining preferences making every morning during my three week stay an absolute delight.",5,2015,07,04
115,We loved our three connecting rooms,"Spent 5 nights with our family of six. Had a mini suite, next to two other rooms. Not truly connecting, but kind of a little pod of rooms. The standard room was little small, but the other rooms were quite large. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Service was top notch, from bellman, front desk and restaurant. Especially liked the help we received from the concierge. Location is very close to Covent Garden and Soho. We walked every night to a huge selection of fine dining options.",5,2015,07,03
115,Beautiful!,"visited this hotel back in March this year for an overnight stay while visiting family in lodnon. 
Such a beautiful hotel. We had afternoon tea on the evening we stayed and it was amazing! 
Thank you to all the staff from start to finish for making our stay so enjoyable.",5,2015,07,02
115,Exceeded Expectations,"Stayed here with my wife for 4 nights in June.  This hotel was part of a Delta Vacations package which included Business Elite travel.  We were in a King Superior Room on the 3rd floor room 308.  No view, but who cares, nothing to see when in a city with buildings next to buildings, but quiet it was!  The room was very adequate and service was top notch.  We were greeted by Abdul (concierge).  Marlene checked us in and only hitch was she asked for a voucher-which we did not receive-although they had the reservation so really no issue.  I had taken along a copy of the reservation I had with me.  We had a fantastic dinner the first night in the Landseer dining room, my wife the burger and I had the steak. Wine selection was good and service was excellent!  Next day we awaited for our travel companions to arrive, and they were delayed.  Breakfast was included (as best as I could figure out-it is with any room stay) and the breakfast was buffet or order off the menu, and we used both and found all to be excellent.....getting use to coffee in the UK or even the European continent takes some getting used to...our American tastes.  Since we had to wait we found ourselves having a late lunch snack, Ruthie had the onion soup with cheese sandwich (she thought excellent) I had a small salad as I can recall and it was very good as well. On our last night all 4 of us had dinner, my wife the Burger, I had the lamb shank, Terri had a fish dish if I recall correctly, and Joe had the Fish & Chips which he thought were excellent. 
 The location of the hotel is fantastic--borders on the Covent Garden (although we never got there), 1/2block from the British Museum/Library (didn't get there either) about a 5min walk to the Tottenham Center Underground Station being remodeled but that line gets you everywhere..centrally located.  I must also give kudos to the restaurant hostesses/staff particularly Maria and Estrellia who, after the 1st day, knew what each of the 4 of us wanted with our breakfast, the coffee, toasted bread, etc. and had it before us even before we had settled in our chairs.  They were outstanding.  I believe I also indicated Abdul went above and beyond when we initially checked in and all the staff were excellent.  We would definitely return to The Bloomsbury Hotel.   Oh, did i mention --when Queen Elizabeth and her sister Margaret when growing up they used to come to the hotel for High Tea and swimming...as youths.  Originally this building was built for the Young Womens Christian Association...it has very interesting history.   
   When coming to London you can not do better than The Bloomsbury Hotel.",5,2015,07,02
115,"Very nice hotel, great room and  location","Stayed here for a night, close to Oxford Street and a small walk to Regent Street in a hub of great pubs, restaurants and shopping.

The hotel was nice, small, boutique, great rooms, good desk and Nespresso machine with the capsules provided. ",4,2015,07,01
115,"Great service, great breakfast","The Bloomsbury hotel has been my home out of my home during my frequent visits to London. Modern but classy small hotel, convenient located near the British museum and walking distance from theaters, Soho, and most of London attractions. Also very well located for business with very good restaurants around but also good diners and fast food restaurants in the area. Very clean hotel, excellent breakfast. Maria ,the hostess during breakfast time is really great. Afternoon tea at The Juicery is also remarkable. Still the hotel needs to improve its loyalty program customer service and have more personalized attention at the front desk. I recommend The Bloomsbury hotel for your business stay in London.",4,2015,07,01
115,London travel in a wheelchair,"This is a wheelchair-accessible, luxury boutique hotel with a great location. There is a lift on the side of the building for wheelers to enter. It is a quiet, friendly hotel with excellent customer service. They offer a car service for pick-up and delivery from Heathrow. The price is less than a taxi, which costs about 100 GBP in traffic. We stayed in room 416. Doorway width is 30 inches. Bed height is 24 in. Bath door is 30 in. Toilet height is 19.5 in. Sink clearance is 21.5 in. Bathroom dimensions 92 in.x 126 in. The room is small, and the narrowest point, due to furniture placement is 27"". The carpet is plush. Nearest tube station is Tottenham Court Station, which should have an elevator by 2016. But the easiest way to get around London is by walking, or using the Overground buses, which all have motorized lifts.",5,2015,06,30
115,2 Day conference,"Excellent hotel great facilities for a two day meeting with colleagues from the Nordic countries. Staff very welcoming, food was outstanding. Bedrooms very clean, good quality sheets and pillows, everything you would expect of a 5* hotel.
Location is excellent for visiting all main sites, we undertook a treasure hunt on foot which was good fun lots of picture opportunities whilst seeing some great sites.
Feedback from participants was excellent with not one negative comment.",5,2015,06,29
115,Our weekend,"We experienced a lovely stay at the Bloomsbury and would strongly recommend it to anyone hoping for an unforgettable stay in London.
Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, who were very attentive and happy.",5,2015,06,29
115,"Nice location, friendly staff","I had a small room that was a bit warm. However the bathroom was nicely updated, the location was great, the room was clean, the wifi worked, and the staff was friendly. If you are looking for a 5star hotel or planning to spend a lot of time in the room, this isn't the place for you.  However, if you are looking for a place simply to sleep and relax a little this place is perfect.",4,2015,06,28
115,Be sure to NOT book a small double room!,"We had booked a small double room for 2 people. The term ""small double room"", is not only referring to the fact that the room has a size of a shoebox and that the bathroom cannot have two people in it at the same time, it also means the bed is just a large single. bed. So if you are with two people, and you need to sleep in a large single, be aware at least one of you will not sleep well and both of you are in constant danger of falling off the bed. And this for 200 GPB. We don't mind having a small room, but if we pay for a double room, than the least we expect is that both of us have decent enough space to sleep. And with small room also come other inconveniences: hardly any place to put your clothes in the closet, no plugs anywhere near the bed (also no bedside tables), etc. Pretty uncomfortable room that with dark an ugly decoration. Not worth a penny of what we paid, but I guess that is London for you. Wifi only operates at times, and mostly not.",2,2015,06,28
115,Staying in central London ,This is a great hotel to stay in right in the centre of London close to totenham court tube and not far from Leicester Square and soho. The decor in the hotel is comfortable and cosy and the room's are well equipped everything you need is here so for a great visit i recommend this place ,5,2015,06,27
115,"Fantastic hotel, thank you all. ","A fantastic stay at a friendly, classy hotel. I arrived exhausted straight from a charity bike ride, dressed for the ride not dressed for a typical stay in the hotel. Each member of staff I met made me feel incredibly welcome, helped me with my ridiculously heavy bag where needed: the service was brilliant. 
It's the little touches that really made my stay wonderful. Coffee machine pods topped up on leaving to meet friends in town as an example.  With all of the small things, and the wonderful breakfast spread, the Bloomsbury is the epitome of old fashioned elegant service. Sincere thanks for your support of the Help for Heroes Band of Brothers. Very much appreciated. ",5,2015,06,26
115,Bloomsbury,"I stayed at the Bloomsbury hotel, from Monday to Thursday for business purposes. I had such an amazing stay, the staff are all fantastic, super friendly and professional! My room (superior room) was gorgeous, clean and I did not want for anything.  I will definitely book to stay here again ! ",5,2015,06,26
115,friendliest hotel in London,"I stayed 2 nights in June, from the moment you walk through the door (led by the concierge) you are made to feel special. Good quality furnishings etc, exceptional continental breakfast as we were too full for the English, but it is the friendly, knowledgeable staff who really make it. Please do look after them they are the biggest asset.",5,2015,06,26
115,The hero ride 2015,"Thank you to all the staff at the Bloomsbury Hotel you accommodated us so well and helped us where help was needed 

The room was clean and very
well presented 

And the location was close to all amenities and London attractions 

Thank you and I would definitely stay again

Value for your money",5,2015,06,26
115,Business trip to London,"Very satisfied with the overall experience during my stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel in London. The staff was top notch and the Landseer Bar had the best drinks in the city. The friendliness of the staff, specifically Joel Miguel, made me feel right at home.",5,2015,06,25
115,Beautiful hotel,"This is a absolutely beautiful hotel and is in an excellent location. Our room was not quite ready on arrival and we were immediately allocated another room to ensure we were not kept waiting at reception. The room was very nice,  maybe a tiny bit on the small side, but for all the time we were in it, this was not really an issue. We only had breakfast in the restaurant, which is amazing. An excellent selection is provided from both the buffet selection and the kitchen selection. Would not hesitate to recommend and would stay on our next trip to London.",5,2015,06,23
115,Good place to stay in central London,"This is a classical, calm and well situated hotel. The service is friendly and cleaning is mostly good, although a bit varying. For the price in question this has to be rather meticulous! The location near the British Museum, shopping and public connections is quite good.
We had two connecting suites for our family of five, and that worked out well. In my opinion this hotel was well chosen even if it was overpriced compared to international standards. But that is just the way London is.",4,2015,06,23
115,Faultless,"Stayed here for 2 nights with my partner for a Luxury Weekend in London.
Managed to get a suite, Room 414, at a reasonable price.
The room had everything we needed, lots of space and great amenities. The bath was amazing and possibly one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in.
The Evening turndown service was a great touch, coming back to a bed ready to get into along with some lovely chocolates.
Room service was really good, and not too expensive, concierge were great all of the staff were really helpful.
Would DEFINITELY stay here again.",5,2015,06,21
115,Amazing!,"Had a great time at The Blommsbury. Comfy room, very nice staff and great location. I've been here for work, it's a four star hotel but i had a quality time, just like a five star hotel like The Geosvenor or The Westbury Mayfair here in London. Kudos.",5,2015,06,21
115,Wonderful stay,"Fantastic hotel, my favourite place in London to stay. Friendly, helpful and welcoming staff. Gorgeous rooms with really comfy beds, bed linen is divine, cool, crisp Egyptian cotton. Bathrooms and bedrooms are always spotless. You definitely feel cosseted when you stay at the Bloomsbury! Old fashioned elegance, afternoon tea, a lovely outdoor terrace perfect to sit with a crisp wine or a fruity cocktail (the lovely waitress made up a great pimms for me!). Turn down service is decedent and I love the night cap menu thats been recently added. The staff genuinely can't do enough for you here and as a sometimes lone traveller (female) I always feel perfectly safe in the hotel. Great for business or leisure stays I can't recommend this hotel enough!",5,2015,06,21
115,Exceptional!,"What a wonderful place to stay. Such a good location for seeing the sights and shopping. Staff at this wonderful hotel were amazing, nothing was too much trouble, and everyone greeted you with a smile. Breakfast was delicious and the room comfortable and quiet. Thank you!",5,2015,06,21
115,"Excelent breakfast, good service, nice decoration","Kind staff, real professionists, Elena, Andreea, Bogdan, sorry if I forget someone. This hotel is divine. For us is like amother home. Rooms are always clean, room service is excelent and the glass of champagne from the check in make us relaxed.",5,2015,06,20
115,Perfect stay,"Just got back from a 2 night stay at this hotel. Honestly cannot fault it, from the minute we walked in we were treated well. The room was spotless and very well furnished, bed was incredibly comfortable. The location is perfect too, will definitely recommend this hotel and go back ",5,2015,06,19
115,First rate accommodation in North London,"We stayed here last week for three evenings and the room/staff were superb.  No hassles whatsoever with checking in or out and the room service was excellent as well.  It's located near Tottenham Court Road station which is convenient for getting around on the Northern Line too.  I'd highly recommend staying at the Bloomsbury Hotel if you want to be based in North/Central London.  Just make sure to check the name, as there are several hotels with 'Bloomsbury' in their names.",5,2015,06,17
115,Totally divine hotel,"My Husband and I simply adore this hotel - it is perfect in every way. The staff are kind, attentive and really care. The Landseer restaurant and bar are so relaxing, it's a real treat to have a late night drink in the bar. We just celebrated a special occasion and the Bloomsbury hotel went above and beyond for us. Thank you.",5,2015,06,17
115,Superb stay,"It was my husband's 65th Birthday and I planned a surprise weekend for him and stayed at The Bloomsbury. We had a wonderful stay, our room was beautiful with an extremely comfortable queen sized bed. A stunning bathroom with fluffy white towels and complimentary toiletries . From the minute we stepped into the hotel the staff were really helpful,polite and welcoming, nothing was too much trouble. We had breakfast the next morning which was included in our package. Absolutely delicious! Wonderful cold buffet on offer and we ordered a full English breakfast which was equally delicious. When one of the staff , Maria, found out it was my husband's birthday she organised a glass of champagne for us both with our breakfast , a really thoughtful gesture, a big thank you to her and the rest of the staff who made this a truly memorable experience. We will  definitely  be going back !",5,2015,06,17
115,Charm & Elegance in a good location,"Exceptional experience , old world charm, an amazing oasis of cultured calm right in the heart of the West End. All the staff were very helpful everyone with a smile on their faces. The Lanseer Restaurant was excellent and good value. The prices are not cheap for drinks but this was served with a high level of care, with accompanying complimentary snacks",5,2015,06,17
115,"Lovely hotel, great location","Had a lovely weekend in London (12-14 June) staying at this hotel.   Had a Superior Queen Room with large comfy bed, lovely bathroom and great toiletries, and kettle & Nespresso.   Even had a little booklet in the room on the history of the building.   Staff very helpful, including the gesture on departure of a bottle of water ""for the journey"" which was a nice touch.   

Ideal for a visit to the Dominion Theatre (just around the corner) and all other attractions.   Just a 10-15minute stroll to theatreland, Convent Garden, and Oxford Street.   Breakfast package (if taken separately) is expensive but there are plenty of places around to provide.   We had the full English b'fast as part of our package and there was loads of choice (including smoked salmon & scrambled eggs) so no complaints there.  Would recommend this hotel.",4,2015,06,16
115,"Great location, great hotel","We stayed in the Bloomsbury hotel for a weekend. When the staff released my wife and I were celebrating my birthday we were immediately upgraded to a room with a king size bed. We had a great time staying in the hotel. The room was snug but perfect for our needs. The bed was luxurious. We also had a docking station in our room and even a Nespresso machine! 
The breakfast was pricey (£26 for a cooked breakfast) however this gives you full access to the continental buffet as well so the choice on offer is huge and of very high quality.
We would definitely stay here again and intend to take my parents back for the afternoon tea offer they currently have. The staff are first class like the hotel too, well done!",4,2015,06,15
115,Weekend in London visiting the Summer Exhibition,"Stayed in the Bloomsbury because it is in a convenient location for visiting the Royal Academy to see the Summer Exhibition. The hotel looks lovely inside, the staff are very helpful and friendly, room was good and dinner and breakfast were delicious with a good choice. Have stayed here before and would definitely stay again.",5,2015,06,15
115,"Great location, warm friendly service, elegant surroundings","I stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel as part of a business trip. Arriving early I was able to walk to key attractions. The staff could not have been nicer, they sent up a tray of tea and honey after I checked in and was obviously suffering from a cold. Room was elegant and comfortable. Chic bathroom with a separate shower, love that. Good breakfast options including fresh pressed juices. Easy to access Wifi with no sign in nonsense.",5,2015,06,14
115,The Landseer restaurant,"We experienced a wonderful 5 days at the Bloomsbury Hotel at the commencement of each day the scene was set to ensure the best possible outcome for our stay from the service we received at breakfast. Estelita -Maria Maya greeted us warmly and ensured we were seated comfortably with tea or coffee and a newspaper before a waitress took our order. Maria ran the breakfast restaurant very professionally, overseeing the other staff members were also delivering professional, courteous and attentive service such as herself. Breakfast was something to look forward to each day and set us off on our day of touring with a spring in our step. I highly recommend the Bloomsbury for breakfast for personalised, professional service and menu with a wide selection of delicious and healthy options.",5,2015,06,14
115,Not bad at all...,"Stayed here few years ago and returned with a last min booking..seemed to have had a refurb since my last stay
Great location close to everything centrally..
Room was quite spacious actually for London,.. Asked for a quite room and unfortunately had a noisy vent of some kind in the ceiling.. 
Bed was not the most comfortable quite hard..
Decor was nice and modern.. Clean
Staff were ok service wise..
Would probably stay here again",4,2015,06,12
115,Almost perfect,"The hotel is very friendly. Great location just 5 minutes by foot from all important features: Soho nightlife, Oxford and Regent streets shoping, main theatres etc...and if you wish to go further away the Totenham court road metro is located 50m from hotel door. staff is friendly and helpfull. Only drawback was the size of bed in the standard room - too small for a tall couple...",4,2015,06,12
115,Landseer Restaurant,"I would like to say that quite often when I'm in Bloomsbury in London, I have a meal in the Bloomsbury Hotel's Landseer Restaurant and I took it for granted of how good the excellent service and wine seller and the quality of food.
I am a big fan of steak and without a doubt this is one of the best I have had.
I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting a meal in London especially as it is close to the Dominion theatre.
A big thank you to Alex, Andre,  and Mikela for their great service!",5,2015,06,10
115,Dinner Before Lord Of The Dance Excellent food & Value,"Booked online through theater  for 3 course for 2 adults and 2 teenagers called to check it was OK to bring 2 children and was told yes and they had a children's menu.
We arrived but it turned out they do not have a children's menu but no problem just chose from the main menu and they would make a small portion for each child. 
The 3 course meal we had was excellent the wine was very nice the older children served what drinks they would like. We paid £23 for the meal each with a drink for 4 adults, asked to pay for the children and the extra drinks and told no problem on us as you pre-paid. Staff super nice would go back like a shot great night before the amazing show!!",5,2015,06,09
115,What an amazing hotel!!,"Having just returned from the Bloomsbury Hotel I would just like to say what an amazing visit it was. We stayed for the weekend with family and couldn't have been more impressed. From the staff on the receptions desk to the chambermaids every one was so helpful nothing was too much trouble. We had breakfast on two days and the choice was incredible but we couldn't resist the full English !!
Our rooms were spotless and we enjoyed an afternoon just relaxing in our room. 
The hotel is very central so we walked to most places we wanted to see
Do visit you won't be disappointed.",5,2015,06,09
115,Great location Excellent service!,"Great location, just a minute walk from Oxford St. Excellent service and very friendly and helpful staff. I got late checkout 3 pm with no extra charge.

",5,2015,06,09
115,Superb!,"Stunning hotel, old fixtures and fittings which have been restored beautifully, staff extremely friendly and accommodating. Rooms modern and lovely breakfast cooked fresh to order.

Would definitely use this hotel again in the future.",5,2015,06,09
115,Blooming Excellent!!,"We stayed on Saturday night and the welcome from staff, service, room and dining were all excellent.  We stayed in a superior double room at the back of the hotel.  Beautiful bed linen and a very comfy bed.  My husband had the best sleep that he's had in ages.  Breakfast was well worth the extra money.
Would definitely return. ",5,2015,06,08
115,Oasis of cultured calm,"Exceptional experience , juicery is a wonder to behold, amazing oasis of cultured calm right in the heart of the West End. Concierge very helpful everyone walking around with a smile on their faces and level of cleanliness seldom seen in a hotel of such character. Rates very competitive. Standard rooms very spacious .",5,2015,06,07
115,Quiet hotel in excellent location,Unusual for near Oxford Street and West End this hotel was super quiet enabling good nights sleep. Very convenient for Shaftesbury theatre and 5 mins walk to Covent Garden. Top quality breakfast and excellent bar. Rooms a little on the small side but not unusual for central London. Well stocked mini bar and very good coffee machine. Would recommend if staying up in town for West End show. ,4,2015,06,07
115,Our stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel,"I booked this hotel for my wife's birthday. I booked tickets to see Lord of The Dance at the Dominion Theatre, so this hotel was very closeby to that, so was very convenient. I think I chose the most expensive room in the hotel, so it was over £400.00 for the two of us, including breakfast. The room was lovely however, had a huge bed, two lounge chairs and foot stall, very large room, large bathroom with roll top bath and a large shower cubicle too. There was a safe in the room and a mini bar as well. The prices are not cheap for drinks. We went back to the bar at 12pm or so to have a drink. Ordered two Bacardi and cokes, which was £20.00!!!. The meal however was very good value for money in the hotel, and i do not think it was that expensive compared to others I have been to. The hotel was very nice inside, the staff are very courteous and friendly. If you have the money to spare, then I would say it's well worth booking.",5,2015,06,04
115,Excellent Service,Excellent Service by entire hotel team! We stayed for 6 days here and the guest services manager Mr.Malaka has been an instrumental customer service guy. Made our family stay a phenomenal one! Keep it up!,5,2015,06,04
115,Great Hotel And Amazing Staff,"It has been a extrodinary stay in London thanks to the Bloomsbury Hotel and staff. Special Thank you goes to the guest relation manager (Malaka) who looked after us and been very helpful. Great Location, Great Staff and Great Hotel Thank you.",5,2015,06,03
115,Lindsay 05,Great welcome. Comfortable and clean. Close to tube and shopping and British Museum. Reception and Concierge helpful. Check out discounted breakfast. Stayed 4 nights. Easy walk to theatres. Hot towel on arrival and bottle water on departure nice touch.,4,2015,06,01
115,Afternoon tea,"Over the last 6 months I have had afternoon tea with unlimited bubbles at least 3 times. The first was lovely, took afternoon tea in the restaurant, food fresh and great service, enjoyed it so much took my husband. Second time service was even better, waitress so attentive the bubbles were flowing. Third time I went back with friends from the first time, I asked for a table in the restaurant again as it in the pas was nice but apparently there was a large group and was seated in the lounge. The lounge was nice as we were in the corner but very open and basically at the entrance as you walk into the hotel. It took a few mins for someone to attend to us. We were asked if we would like tea, we all said no but I did ask for a glass of water instead, after 3 hours the water still hadn't arrived. The waiter was ok but not as good as service as we had previously. He kept referring to the bubbles being the Queens champagne but it's sparkling wine, it was very nice but he kept repeating it. We weren't informed when the drinks were stopping bring served, in the past we have been told it was our last glass. They were not in any hurry for us to leave and we stayed for a few hours just talking and having a nice time. The sandwiches were fresh and tasty, stones nice, cakes a little disappointing but still nice. Price has increased in the last 6 months but still good value. Would go back.",4,2015,05,31
115,Excellent enjoyable stay. Thank you.,"We just spent a night away at the Bloomsbury -30th may. As per all other reviews we found the staff to be extremely friendly, kind and efficient. Louise on reception made the celebration of our 10 year wedding anniversary by some lovely personal touches. She is a gem. Amazing to find all the staff so consistently nice and efficient. We had pre theatre dinner in the hotel which was fantastic and again the manager was absolutely lovely thank you and keep up the excellent work.",5,2015,05,31
115,Enjoyable Stay,Stayed for 5 nights.  Rooms well set up but 'London' size!  Great bar downstairs and well located for access to high street and shows and the tube.  Gym in the basement adequate but not spectacular.    Great 24hr diner across the street.,4,2015,05,29
115,"Comfort, Location & Super Friendly Staff.",I was only able to spend 1 night at this beautiful hotel but wished I could have stayed longer. The staff are so friendly and helpful and the location was perfect for exploring London's landmarks. The rooms were so comfortable (down to the carpet). I would highly recommend this hotel and look forward to my next visit to The Bloomsbury.,5,2015,05,27
115,Extremely high standard throughout,"We recently stayed at the Bloomsbury for a family special occasion after a recommendation by a friend. Everything about our stay was terrific - the rooms are extremely comfortable, the staff superb throughout and the breakfasts to die for!
We even received a personal welcome for our family celebration in the form of a bottle of fizz and a cake which we found in the room on our first night! We will certainly be booking again on our next visit to London. Thanks to all the staff, in particular Malaka and Marlene for making our visit special.",5,2015,05,27
115,A wonderful afternoon tea!!,"We booked cocktail afternoon tea here on the 23rd May 2015. As soon as we stepped into this beautiful hotel we was meet with with warm and friendly 'how can we help you?' greeting then escort towards the saloon lounge all the way by happy to help staff. This set the afternoon off wonderfully. The afternoon tea was lovely (we struggled to finish it!!!). The jewel in this hotels crown is the staff here. They were polite, happy to assist in any way and attentive. I stay in London a few times a year and will definitely be changing the hotel i usually use and  will be trying the Bloomsbury just by the service we received that day.",5,2015,05,27
115,A hotel that is going places,"We booked online and didn't really have high expectations as it was such excellent value. However on arrival we were blow away by the beautiful building, the lovely reception and more so by the fantastic staff.

If you are heading into London for an evening I would have no hesitation staying @ this hotel.",5,2015,05,26
115,Fabulous!,"Wonderful hotel, great location and fabulous staff who go out of their way to make you feel very welcome.  Concierge always extremely friendly and helpful.  Our hotel of choice for every trip to London!

115,Lucky find,I booked this hotel due to its proximity to the dominion theatre this is now firmly on my will definitely comeback list excellent hotel great service good room phenomenal breakfast. Good all around well done,4,2015,05,25
115,"Lovely sitting area for tea, coffee, cake etc but toilets are disgusting","We wanted fruit with our coffee but Chris (the waiter, very polite and obliging) is not allowed to serve it - management, you are there to give your customers what they want surely?

A mission to find the toilets and when we did  they had not been cleaned for days.

Hotel lets itself down with silly things like cleanliness and inflexibility.",2,2015,05,25
115,Visiting family,"Our stay was very nice . Staff was very accommodating 
Made our stay mean a lot room was nice will stay again in the near future 4 star rating.if u get a chance book a night as we no u will think the same as we do .",4,2015,05,25
115,Afternoon tea ,"Went for afternoon tea with friends. We did by mistake end up at the other Bloomsbury hotel just up the road so do make sure you go to the right one. 

What a great hotel. The staff were extremely polite and helpful from the moment you enter and made the experience extra special wish more places was like it. 

They even noticed it was my birthday and got us a special complimentary cocktail.

We had the tea champagne cocktails that were endless. There were certain foods I couldn't have but they catered for that as well. There was so much food we weren't even able to finish it all was well made and well presented. 

Would definitely go back to stay. ",5,2015,05,24
115,Highly recommend ,"Stayed in this hotel mid week due to being in London on business. The room was lovely and quiet and really clean. The breakfast, particularly the eggs Benedict and eggs Royale were second to none. Compliments to the chef(s). Brian, the Head Concierge, was incredibly knowledgeable and helpful, especially to my wife who was smitten with the library. The restaurant staff were polite and efficient. I very much look forward to my next stay in such a professional,yet friendly, hotel.",5,2015,05,22
115,Magster,Really loved this hotel and the price is right and the service wonderful.  I especially enjoyed landseer restaurant!  Excellent food and service lovely.  Estelita was particularly wonderful. I would recommend wholeheartedly,5,2015,05,22
115,Exceptional experience,"My daughter and I stayed two nights at the Bloomsbury Hotel. The hotel is beautiful and comfortable. The staff went out of their way to be helpful, especially the lovely young woman at reception. The room was very quiet and secure and the location is perfect for theater buffs like us.  ",5,2015,05,21
115,Elegant and welcoming hotel. Highly recommend.,"Booked 1 night as a birthday treat for my wife. It was perfect. The room, the staff, the service. All first class. Its has an intimate feel yet enough grandeur to feel special. Great location. A 2 minute walk to the British museum and 10 for Covent garden. Thank you to everyone at the hotel. 
Note: The nearest tube station is Tottenham court road but it is closed on the central line until December 2015. We got off at the next stop at Holburn and had a 10-15 minute walk to the hotel. Perhaps Russell square tube station on the northern line might be closer.",5,2015,05,20
115,The Bloomsbury Hotel,"I recently stayed at this property and loved every minute of it. I arrived early in the morning and my room was not ready but I was treated to tea and pastries in the lounge. Within 45 minutes I was on my way to my room. The staff is very friendly, welcoming and extremely helpful. The room was lovely and the location perfect. I highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2015,05,20
115,Birthday Treat,"My girlfriend and I have birthdays 6 days apart so I thought it would be nice to have a meal in town and stay over in a nice room. Having stayed at the Bloomsbury before and always had good experiences I booked a studio suite. After booking, the representative I had been speaking with called me back to inform me that for the same price I could have a bottle a Champagne on arrival, breakfast in bed and extended check-out time so obviously chose this option.

Upon arrival, not only did we have a nice bottle of Moet to greet us but also a birthday cake and card which was a really nice touch. The suit was amazing with a roll top bath with a tile mounted TV, huge comfortable bed, large flat screen TV with Sky and all the comforts of home. 

All the staff were very friendly and helpful and we will definitely stay at the Bloomsbury again.",5,2015,05,20
115,Fantastic business trip,"I stayed at this hotel for one night. The staff were very helpful, the decor of the hotel was modern with a luxurious feel to it. I often stay in hotels in london for work and I will be staying here agin. Room fantastic with great aromatherapy toiletries! ",5,2015,05,19
115,Fabulous afternoon tea,"I booked afternoon tea here as a treat for my husband's 40th birthday.  Everything about our visit was first class - the decor, the ambience, the food and the service.  Our afternoon tea was served with free flowing Bloomsbury Cuvee Merret which was fabulous and our glasses were kept well topped up for the duration.  Wouldn't hesitate in returning and would definitely recommend.",5,2015,05,18
115,Had a wonderful time,"Had a really great weekend at the Bloomsbury.  I have given it an overall rating of 5 stars but the staff could have been a little more friendly.  Clean and nicely located, we had a lovely weekend, food was good.",5,2015,05,18
115,Weekend away,"stayed in this lovely hotel, stunning place, lovely staff very friendly and helpful and the food was to die for . The room was fab had everything you needed just a shame i was not there for longer and on the plus side lovely and quiet too so no problem with sleeping",5,2015,05,17
115,"Nice interior, training of staff needed","We have stayed at two other Doyle collection hotels in London and been very satisfied. Our stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel however had a rocky start but ended well. 
We arrived late and we could not get the room that we had booked. There was also some initial language confusion. I am not a native english speaking person but with the rates you are paying at this hotel you expect to be understood and understand what the personnel is saying. 
We went downstairs for a late supper and even though the personnel was nice they managed to misunderstand my order so instead of grilled salmon I got grilled chicken with noodles ;) Clearly some additional training would be beneficial for the reception staff as well as the waiters. 

The following day we got the rooms that we wanted (Deluxe with King bed) which were very nice and the stay became very nice in the end.

The location is good, the interior is beautiful, the beds and linen are perfect and towels are thick. The gym is small but adequate.",4,2015,05,17
115,Service and Location Top Notch,"We arrived at this hotel with  friends and family from all over the world and within half an hour of checking in we were at the British Museum.  The museum is a block and a half away.   My children thought that was the highlight of our trip and we went there three different days.  We were also within walking distance of a number of theaters and went to see Le Miserable.  The location was fantastic and that alone would be worth a five star rating.  But the hotel is also a really lovely place to spend a week.  We had a suite but we had friends and family in deluxe and superior rooms and all of them were lovely.  The rooms were spotlessly clean.  The baths were well appointed.  The suite bath better than the rest, of course.  The rooms were well equipped.  Everybody we encountered on staff was very friendly and professional.  We had a problem with our suite not connecting with our children's room and while they couldn't resolve that, even though when I made the reservations on the phone I was told they would be connecting, they offered a solution we could live with.  I would require a connecting room when we visit again.  We ate at the restaurant twice and had afternoon tea twice.  The food and service were outstanding.  The concierge was helpful in arranging theater tickets and transportation on a number of occasions.  London is an extremely expensive city, more so than Tokyo.  I felt that we received accommodations and a level of service far beyond what we paid.  I felt this hotel was a real bargain for London.  ",5,2015,05,15
115,Excellent Service | Excellent Hotel | Excellent Location,I loved the service. The staff was very friendly & nice. Apart from that hotel lies at an amazing & historical location. It is near to city & palaces like shopping malls are near from it so you can spend some of your free time shopping out.,5,2015,05,15
115,What a delight,"I am a very frequent traveler and visit dozens of hotels every year.
In my travels I have been to London many times so I am accustomed to the ""London standard"" of high priced, relatively small rooms in hectic hotels or areas.
The Bloomsbury is a refreshing change.
Fantastic location, just at the edge of lively Soho and the nutritious Oxford street shopping experience (you men know what I mean...). Despite its central location it is very quiet.
Great rooms but more importantly amazing staff.
I reserved a last minute (literally few hours ahead ..) anniversary weekend. It was ample time for the staff to be ready with a warm welcome (don't skip the hot towel and refreshing drink) and perks in our room.
Highly recommended.",5,2015,05,14
115,Staff superior and polite,"Helpful, polite and caring. Rooms are extremely clean and comfortable. Excellent location and did not get lost once which is pretty good for me. Restaurant - the food was excellent and beautifully served. Brian was very cheerful and helpful, Paolo was very reassuring and gracious.",5,2015,05,13
115,Fantastic Hotel - Highly Recommend,"My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon and everything about the hotel was perfect:
  - Room - Well appointed and comfortable
  - Location - Right in the center of London and convenient to just about everything; a 5 - 10 minute walk to the British Museum or three different tube stations which will get you anywhere else you want to go in the city.  Or, if you're like us, you can walk to all of the big attractions in the city in 30-45 minutes or less: Tower of London, Westminister Abbey, Parliament, Buckingham Palace, etc.
  - Service - Fantastic!  From the front desk staff who checked us in, to the concierge who helped us get tickets to a show in Leceister Square and the restaurant staff for breakfast in the morning - everyone was friendly, helpful and professional.  I would like to especially mention and thank Alina and Joel in the Landseer bar who were the perfect hosts for late night cocktails after our days exploring the city.

If you traveling to London for business or pleasure, you can't go wrong with the Bloomsbury.  We'll certainly be staying here next time we're in the city.",5,2015,05,11
115,Sales convention.,"Excelent service, specially in the restaurant.  I found that they were great at service and food is quite good.  Andree Lilea the host is great.The room has a Nespresso Machine with a few variety of pods, great bed very confortable.  Close to Oxford Street, great if you like running in the morning, can go quickly to Hyde Park (20 mins).
              ",5,2015,05,11
115,The best visit to London .......by far,Everything about this hotel screams 'superior class'. This was my 5th trip to London and by far the best. From the moment you walk through the doors of the hotel you feel welcome and very special. All the staff I encountered were extremely professional with an air of friendliness,5,2015,05,09
115,Great hotel and location!!!!,"Staff is very friendly, upon checking everything was great! The front staff Zaan was so helpful. It was our first time in the UK and our honeymoon. The at the front upgraded our room :) what a great start to our honeymoon. The rooms are a decent size for the UK. Location was great, we walked everywhere and a lot of restaurants, shops, sight seeing along the way. The hotel is clean and I am a neat freakso this was up to my standards:) highly recommended hotel!!!!",4,2015,05,09
115,Perfect!,"I stayed at Bloomsbury Hotel in London for 5 days with my wife, and I experienced a very good hotel in a great location in London. Rooms service and common areas of the hotel are excellent. The hotel employees are very polite and helpful.Rooms are huge, and very comfortable. The breakfast is very good, with a delicious black coffee and typical britain bread. The localization is the best quality of this hotel. It has a very good localization, near the most important London's sightseeings, like Eye of London and Parliament. Who likes to enjoy a britain pub, there are a lot of options in Soho, very near from Hotel by walking. I recommend this hotel!",5,2015,05,08
115,Second Visit & just as impressive,"Repeat visit after 2 years & the Bloomsbury still delivers. The room is a good size & well maintained with a compact but functional bathroom. Good desk & comfy chair when working. room faced the road but the double glazing stopped any noise. Staff are helpful. Very handy to the Tube, Covent Garden, the High Street for Shopping & Soho. Downside was the breakfast - menu hadn't change allot from 2 years prior. I would recommend going to Nude Espresso in Soho Sqaure instead - to die for coffee, great menu & a cheeky chef!",4,2015,05,07
115,Time to complement hotel,"I have been stopping at The Bloomsbury for a number of years whilst on business and thought it was time to write a review as when I visit London for business, this is generally my go to hotel. 

Why choose the Bloomsbury, first the staff and excellent service. Second the location, close to Euston in a central location for both work and leisure with the west end on the door step. Third the rooms, the comfy beds, facilities and most important when on business a decent iron and ironing board. Try the bar, an escape from the hustle and bustle and a great pint of Freedom lager. If you don't fancy the in house restaurant, which is good, venture down to Charlotte St nearby for a selection of good quality restaurants. 

In all a great hotel you will visit again and again.",5,2015,05,06
115,Pleasant theatre and museum trip,"Perfect location for a visit to the Dominion Theatre, we could see the stage door entrance from our room. 
Really, really pleasant staff, everyone was friendly and smiley which makes you feel at home, valued and welcome.
Our room was very clean and beautifully decorated. The hotel really is a calm oasis in heart of bustling London. Lovely cocktails and pre theatre dining option, added to the value.
Only slight niggles that stopped me awarding five stars, the tissue receptical in the bathroom had none in at all, not even an empty box and also the cream left by the coffee machine was well and truly off, it was so bad it had turned to jelly.
All in all a super place to stay and I'd recommend it.",4,2015,05,06
115,Very Pleasant Indeed,"Very friendly staff from our arrival, all smiles and very welcoming. We had the standard room which is still very nice indeed and a touch of luxury I felt. Nice quiet room with very good blackout curtains (so good we slept in!). Lots of extras available, admittedly for a price, but still its nice that the services are there. All in all a very nice stay and an impressive hotel right in the middle of it all, just behind the British Museum and within 5 minutes walk of the theatres",5,2015,05,05
115,March in London,The hotel is quite cozy and with very comfortable bed and pillows. Room was very neat and general ambient exceedingly relaxing. Food quality is ok but there are great restaurants close by  - you're in the heart of London!,5,2015,05,03
115,Wonderful Stay for Theatre Visit,"The Bloomsbury Hotel was excellent. Upon arrival to hotel the Reception staff offered me a complimentary drink and heated towel to freshen up. The reception staff were extremely welcoming and check in was quick and easy. The quality of the room was superb. It was extremely clean. The soft furnishings, especially the bedding felt so luxurious and I really enjoyed my nights sleep. The one thing that did let the room down was that the TV/ Remote was not functioning properly but because we spent the evening out at the theatre this wasn't too much of an issue. The location is perfect to get to west end shows and there are some great eateries around. I would  thoroughly recommend staying here.",5,2015,05,02
115,Location Location Location!,"The Bloomsbury (not to be confused with Bloomsbury Street Hotel) is a Dowd group facility and they know how to make your stay pleasant and comfortable.  Facilities, restaurant, food, and hospitality were superb.  Every staff member we encountered was helpful and pleasant.  A special shout out to Brian Murphy, Concierge, as without his daily guidance the trip would have been less than memorable.  
We loved our stay in London, and have to say the Bloomsbury was perfect for all our needs.  Central location for walking, restaurants, attractions, the tube and busses.",5,2015,04,30
115,"Very good, well located hotel","We chose the Bloomsbury because of a great e perience with its sister hotel in Dublin, the Westbury.  The Bloomsbury is lovely and centrally located, about 2 blocks from Tottenham Court Road tube station.  Staff are vey helpful.  Hotel is very comfortable.  One complaint is lack of drawer/shelf space.  We were there 4 nights and literally had to live out of suitcases.  Small issue, and relatively minor in the overall scheme of things.",4,2015,04,30
115,Wonderful Hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights on business trip.  Basically, right next to the British Museum.  Very quiet room which was awesome for me.  Good sized bed.  Good speed wi-fi (it's free).  Loved the breakfast.  Breakfast staff was unbelievably friendly and efficient, especially Mana.  She was always smiling, offering coffee, paper, etc.  Great person.  Try their eggs benedict and pancakes, both are excellent.  Ask for french press coffee, very smooth.  

Only negative is that room was small.  Then again, it's London so don't expect any American sized hotel room.  

Overall, it's a wonderful hotel to stay in.  Close to many attractions and tons of restaurants but most of all, wonderful friendly staff.",5,2015,04,30
115,Great Choice,"First of all, I am very impressed by the Doyle Collection and want to stay in all of their properties.  My last stay was at the exceptional Westbury in Dublin and it left me with very high expectations for the Bloomsbury Hotel in London.  That, and the fact that friends had told me how much they liked the Bloomsbury.  

I can report that it is a great place to stay, but the ""suite"" to which they very kindly upgraded us felt a bit more like a generously sized room - which is a lovely thing in the heart of London.  The location is terrific, and it was quiet - which is more than I can say for some other hotels in central London, particularly, nearby Soho. 

We had some issues with the new TV system.  You wouldn't think that would be a big deal but it was Sunday night, we were tired and just wanted to watch a bit of television and the system was not working.  Eventually it came back on and the management was very concerned and trying to help - so I could not have asked for more than that.  

The breakfast, while good, was not exceptional.  Personally, I would walk to one of many local options, if you feel comfortable getting out and about.  Nearby Charlotte Street is a great place to find good food.",4,2015,04,30
115,Lovely friendly hotel,"Stayed here for just the one night with my daughter when we went to see the musical Miss Saigon at the Prince Edward theatre.
It Is a lovely, quaint, nice appointed hotel, the room and en-suite are very tastefully decorated.
Would definitely use this hotel again as the location is fantastic! Very central so highly recommend!
",4,2015,04,30
115,Old Value Views,"This hotel is a must if you are travelling to London and want to be treated with the old fashioned values. The hotel is in walking distance to Tottenham Court Tube Station. On arriving you are met by a well mannered gentleman that opens the doors and immediately takes your suitcase to reception. Here you are greeted by the reception staff that will do almost anything to please you. The rooms are spacious enough, and have all you need to make your stay comfortable, right down to the chocolates on the pillow. On leaving the staff will help you print your boarding card to continue your journey. There is not one staff member in the entire hotel that will not go out of their way to make your stay pleasant. The breakfast buffet is of the highest quality. The afternoon high tea is exception. The dinner in the down stairs bar/pub is delicious. I could carry on with all the positives......",5,2015,04,30
115,Blooming Great at the Bloomsbury Hotel,"Great short stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel. 
Fantastic location just off Oxford Street and short walk to Tottenham Court Road Tube Station. 
Covent Garden and Soho are 5/10 minute stroll away so its great for the theatres, restaurants & bars in the area. 
Hotel has a very intimate feeling when you enter the lobby and the rooms are very nicely planned out. 
Very nice hotel and highly recommended. 
I will definitely stay again on my next trip to London. ",5,2015,04,30
115,Efficient and Friendly,"I have stayed at this hotel about a dozen times, and I am always impressed by the quiet attentiveness of the staff.  Some years back I had a bad accident while in London and I had to extend my stay for a few days before I could travel; everyone there was kind and thoughtful in helping me cope with my injuries.  On my next visit, I found a bottle of wine and a basket of fruit awaiting me in my room, with a note from the manager welcoming me back.  (The rooms, by the way, generally are reasonably decently sized for London.)  The bar downstairs is usually quiet and comfortable, and the restaurant fare is a notch or two above that of most London hotels.",5,2015,04,29
115,Couple get away,"I have stayed in this hotel previously, I will always return.  It oozes sophistication and class.  The service is good and prompt.  I stayed here in January with my fiance and they made our stay perfect.  We are returning there in May 2015.  I will comment further after my stay.  Also Louise the manager and the bar staff are very very good.",5,2015,04,29
115,"A quiet, cosy sleep in the heart of bustling London","The location of The Bloomsbury Hotel is its key selling point.  Within 5 minutes you'll be weaving your way through the dense crowds of shoppers on Oxford Street and, when your feet and wallet can take no more, the restaurants and bars of Covent Garden and Soho are just around the corner.  No need to waste time on hot tubes or gridlocked roads - one of the most vibrant corners of London is all within walking distance.

If it's your first visit to London and you're not sure where to eat, head to Muriel's Kitchen for a healthy breakfast or brunch.  Fernandez and Wells is great for a lunchtime graze on some cured meats and cheese.  For dinner, any one of the Polpo family of restaurants is very good for sharing plates.  Alternatively, start your evening with a Modelo in Wahaca's bar area before moving on to an excellent choice of incredibly good value Mexican street food.  If it's a very special and romantic occasion the sultry Hakkasan is just around the corner but you'll need to book well in advance for a weekend sitting.  And if you just want to have a wander until you find something that appeals, Wardour Street is jam packed with restaurants to please every palate and purse.

The hotel itself is on a particularly quiet street where there's very little nightlife so you should be able to enjoy a peaceful sleep.  Rooms are immaculate - everything feels and smells clean and the crisp white bed linen makes the large bed even more inviting.  It's the kind of room where you won't have to think twice about padding around in your socks.

The one thing that this hotel could work on is its personality.  In some ways, it's a little too reserved.  The gorgeous lobby, for example, is under utilised - it's a huge airy space crying out for some good music and a quirky bar.  Staff, whilst very present, are quiet and not particularly engaging.  In short, there's nothing that really makes you want to loiter in the hotel for a bit before plunging into the world outside.  That said, The Bloomsbury Hotel is a great hotel in a great location - having stayed in many London hotels, this is one of a handful that I'll willingly return to.",4,2015,04,28
115,Chosen due to Trip Advisor Rating - but disappointed,"I selected this hotel for a 4 night stay due to its high Tripadvisor rating, but was disappointed.
There are many good things about this hotel, its in a great location for some major sights, and it is very quiet.
But my deluxe room was small and the bathroom tiny (no bath).  In fact I had to walk around the door to get  to the toilet (ie step into bathroom then shut door  to access toilet) every time I used it.  My shoulders could almost touch  both walls of the shower recess, it was so narrow.  It was a frustration.
The room, on the 6th floor, had 1 small window, whichh gave it a very enclosed feeling.
Apart from these issues it was comfortbale and had all mod cons including a kettle, Nespresso machine, iron etc.  The wifi recpetion in the room was a bit dodgy, it kept droppping out.  The room was cleann and well furnished.
The lobby of the hotel was not inviting and was rarely used by guests and the diniing rooom was in the basement. I did enjoy a dinner there and had 1 breakfast.  On chheck inn nthey offered me breakfasts at a discounted rate of GBP18 per day, cheaper than offered on the website or in the restaurant.
I was not very impressed wiith the concierge  staff, they could not supply a bus map and claimed one did not exist.  I found it myself on thhe internet.
All in all it did not live up to my expectations of a hotel in the top 50 for London.",3,2015,04,27
115,"Nice hotel, noisy party","In general the hotel was very nice. However we were staying on the second floor which is also used for conferences and parties. We were kept awake until past midnight one night by a loud party just down the hall. 
Our complaints were met with a shrug. We will not be going back.",2,2015,04,27
115,Great last minute booking!,"Stayed here for one night, room very clean and tidy, staff very good and friendly... loved the hot flannels they give you on arrival to freshen up!  (little things) Also just across the road was a underground garage which was very handy and not to pricey, and every thing in walking distance. Would stay here again. :) x",5,2015,04,27
115,Impressive Stay,"Lovely hotel, very well kept. Staff extremely polite, friendly and courteous. Highly recommended. We liked the booklet detailing the history of the property that was in the room and the brolly from the wardrobe proved handy.",5,2015,04,27
115,A Great surprise,"I booked the hotel as an anniversary surprise for my wife to include a trip to the Lord of the Dance at the nearby Dominion Theatre. With a pre show meal booked in the Landseer Restaurant.
The Hotel and staff where excellent from start to finish the meal was perfect and the evening cocktails finished the whole experience off nicely.
A big thanks to the Bloomsbury and staff.
See you again I hope.",5,2015,04,27
115,A real treat,"Myself and some friends visited the hotel for champagne afternoon tea.  This was the second time I had visited the hotel for the afternoon tea.  The food was delightful as always and the champagne devine. The only criticism I have is that it was supposed to be a free flowing champagne tea.  On my first visit I got just this, but on my second visit I only had a couple of glasses.  I have a feeling that you have a time limited to when the champagne is available, but without knowing this my friends and I were left with empty glasses feeling like the very attentive staff were ignoring us.  It might be an idea to let the customers know if this is the case.
That said, it was a lovely experience.",4,2015,04,26
115,excellent place to stay for theatre breaks,"fantastic hotel in a great location, very spacious and comfortable with a good mixture of old              and modern furniture and fittings. bedrooms comfy with loads of nice thoughtful touches.all the staff were very polite and helpful especially brian the concierge. definatley go there again.",5,2015,04,24
115,An oasis of calm,"Great location within walking distance of so many interesting places, underground and buses. Decor of bedroom was calm and soothing after a busy day and eventful evening. Beds were really comfortable and the whole ambience was of understated luxury. We enjoyed being able to get a late breakfast on a lazy Sunday morning.",5,2015,04,23
115,"Great location, very good hotel","The hotel is located on Great Russell Street, very close to Tottenham Court Road, Oxford Street, and the West End with all its theatres, galleries etc.  The British Museum is on the same street as the hotel, just about two blocks away.  Very convenient location also in terms of public transportation. 
The room was very confortable, although I thought it was a bit small.  Everything was very nice, clean and well kept.  
Very good wifi. And two Mac computers available for guests near the reception desk.",5,2015,04,23
115,Comfortable and Convenient,"The hotel was modern, clean, and comfortable. Concierge (especially Mario) were informative and very willing to help. Breakfast was included in our package - we were there for a week and did not have a bad meal or run out of options. I highly recommend the Smashed Avocado on Guinness Toast. So tasty! The hotel is a short walk to Trafalgar Square and convenient to a few Tube Stations (don't be scared, use the Tube!). The car service the hotel offers back to the airport was super convenient for our early flight and the price was the same as taxi + Heathrow Express (Tube wasn't running that early). But, I suggest using cash - if you use a credit card, you give the number to a random man over the driver's cell phone. A little sketchy...",5,2015,04,22
115,Fabulous staff,"Stayed here with my family for a week. The staff was so attentive. We had initially been put in a room that was way too small for our family. When we called to ask for something else they thoughtfully moved us to a larger room and gave us some lovely discounts. 

It's a perfect business hotel not too far from soho. They have the loveliest tea and a great smoothie bar. 

The price is also so reasonable for London. Really near everything. 

We loved it. ",5,2015,04,21
115,Bloomsbury Hotel,"As always a very nice stay in a great location.
Just the reception staff not always speedy at check in and out and beds a tad too hard, but rooms great and always a delicious aroma in the reception area",4,2015,04,21
115,We Will Return Again!,"We loved our stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel...the location, the staff, the room, the service, the lobby are....all we wonderful....the concierge was exceptionally warm and friendly and helpful....we will be back...",5,2015,04,21
115,Ms keane,I stay in the Bloomsbury with my boyfriend for my birthday. What a gem of a hotel the room was spotless a cake was in the room for me.what a nice touch.it is perfectly located for soho and Covent Garden.all staff very friendly special mention to the door staff and the lady on the 4th who helped us with our bags to the lift.,5,2015,04,21
115,Very Nice,"My wife and I stayed at the Bloomsbury for ten days in mid April.  We think the Bloomsbury/Covent Garden neighborhood is one of the best, especially if you want good restaurants, museums and theater.  The hotel is within walking distance of the British Museum (one block), Covent Garden and many theaters. The hotel has first class service.  The rooms are very comfortable with every amenity. The space is adequate, remember that this is London where space comes at a premium. Breakfast at the hotel is exceptional with a full a la carte selection of hot dishes or buffet.  Very nice staff attending to your every need.  Really enjoyed the stay.",4,2015,04,20
115,Very good hotel,"We stayed 2 night at The Bloomsbury. Hotel is very clean, rooms are quite small, beds are a bit small aswell. Overall our stay was great. Location is very good, access to all attractions by foot, public transport simple and easy.
",4,2015,04,20
115,Delightfully comfortable hotel for business meetings and the family,"From my checkin, during which Gunilla made me feel so welcomed, to late evenings, when Estelita game me warm milk for my slightly jet lagged 1.5 year old, I enjoyed everything about the Bloomsbury Hotel. The staff were so helpful and accommodating. The restaurant and tea room were wonderful - afternoon tea there is a must. A short walk to the British Museum, SOHO, Coventry Garden, the river is a bit of a walk yet tremendously scenic. I've been many times to London and will come back to the Bloomsbury Hotel.",5,2015,04,19
115,City visit london  bloomsbury hotel,Excellent premises excellent hospitality excellent location at walking distance from the British museum. Also walking distance from London's hotspots. Friendly staff at your service at any moment. High quality breakfast and quiet bar at the reception area. Fast check-out.,4,2015,04,17
115,Excellent hotel,"Had the pleasure of staying at The  Bloosbury  a few weeks ago for a short break with my husband. From the moments we arrived until the day  we left we had a lovely  time. The hotel is in a  fantastic location in central London, with theatres, tube stations and The Britsh Musium on it's doorstep.
The hotel itself was wonderful, with excellent staff who were all very helpful and happy to help. The room was lovely and clean with great facilities and the Nespresso machine was a bonus.
When we return  to Lodon in the future I will not hesitate to book The Bloomsbury  Hotel again.
Thank you all for a wonderful stay, and will definitely be recommending the hotel to friends and family.",5,2015,04,16
115,Lovely Stay,"We stayed here for my wife's Birthday with our two children.  The staff were friendly and so helpful.  The rooms were clean and very comfortable.  The hotel is in a great location with Covent Garden in easy walking distance.  I'd like to thank the hotel for the lovely Birthday Cake they delivered to our room for my wife, it was a special touch and the cake was delicious.  This was our second stay at the hotel and I'm sure we will be back in the future.

115,"Great location, Really nice rooms & Excellent Food","Stayed in the Bloomsbury while on business back in March and I have to say what a great hotel. Great location in central London, only a stones throw from Soho, oxford street etc. Really easy to get to from heath row. The hotel itself from the outside is refined in its look. The foyer is small but offers a kind of homely feel to it. The staff I have to say are excellent and really look after the guest. The room was a decent size and had all the comforts you would expect from a 4 star hotel.
But I have to say that the stand out for this hotel was the food. After my first nights stay I went for breakfast and was very surprised for a restaurant which you have to go to the basement for that it was so bright and welcoming,the waiting staff also helped with the ambiance of this restaurant as they were so warm and friendly and really could not do enough to make sure you had all you needed. I was sat at my table which was roomy and comfortable, I was then directed to the buffet which as buffets go was really well presented with lots of choice  and all fresh from the fruit to the pastries and the juice presented in its own individual bottle was a nice touch. I then ordered a full english with poached eggs and it was cooked to perfection. This really set me up for my day ahead. 
After a long day I returned to the hotel and even though I was so close to soho and its abundance of restaurants nothing would do me but dinner in the restaurant. I had the steak and I must say I am extremely fussy when it comes to a steak, its has to be well done and nine times out of 10 I have to send it back as it is always either under cooked or like the sole of my shoe but this just melted in my mouth, a chocolate tower to finish and a couple of glasses of wine to wash it all down, again the staff were brilliant but as the old saying goes"" my complements to the chef"". This is a hotel I will definitely return too when I am back in London, you can probably get a hotel as nice else where but the food will be hard to beat, 9 out of 10 for the hotel and 10 out of 10 for the food. I will definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2015,04,14
115,"Classic, beautiful hotel. Wonderful staff, great location & fabulous attention to detail","
I have just had the absolute pleasure of staying at the Bloomsbury with friends for a lovely Girls weekend & what a fabulous stay it was! 

We received a warm welcome upon entering the hotel. As we arrived at the hotel early, we knew we wouldn't be able to check in straight away. However, the FOH staff very kindly offered an alternative room to freshen up whilst waiting.  We were offered a delicious ""Cosmo"" at check in & the FOH staff couldn't have been more helpful & welcoming.

The rooms are delightfully presented. The furniture & furnishings were modern, clean & tasteful. The bed was really comfy; the bed linen & duvet were of good quality & we all commented on what an excellent night sleep we had.  Considering we were in central london the outside noise was minimal too. There were soft bath robes provided in the wardrobe, Aromatherapy Associate products in the bathroom, a kettle with tea, hot chocolate & cookies..AND a separate Nespresso machine. I spend at least 2-3 nights a week in 4-5 star hotels around the world & this is quite a rarity.  Most importantly for us girls, a decent hairdryer & iron was provided....again this isn't standard in all 5star hotels I have frequented but a basic in my book! 

Our room was a good size considering our central location....so many city's in the world offer such tiny rooms even at this standard, so we were pleasantly surprised. 

We were lucky enough to be given adjoining rooms, which I believe to be quite a rarity in London. This worked well for us & would be particularly handy when staying with our families on another occasion. The management had very kindly put a beautiful bottle of chilled Ridgeview sparkling wine in our room. I love that the hotel support English wine producers & in particular Ridgeview....if its good enough for our royal family at weddings & golden jubilees then its good enough for us girlies!!!! Again, great attention to detail.

All of the public areas were beautifully presented & the decor was classic & stylish. The bar area downstairs & the lounge area where afternoon tea could be enjoyed were both warm & inviting with a lovely ambience.

We particularly enjoyed breakfast. There was a lovely continental buffet as well as an extensive separate menu to order freshly cooked breakfast items. Both continental and cooked breakfasts were delicious and well presented. The tea & coffee were topped up regularly & again the staff were all most helpful & friendly. 

The breakfast menu also included juices recommend by Amelia Freer...Very current & relevant. Great touch! 

The attention to detail at The Bloomsbury can't go unnoticed. The management clearly care about the service they are providing here & their staff do them proud. 

Thank you for an enjoyable stay. I very much look forward to my next visit and i will mostly certainly be recommending you to all.

115,"Great staff, perfect location, superb property.","We stayed here for 5 nights over Orthodox Easter. What an elegant and architectural historic hotel! Guest rooms are classy, airy and charming fitted out with all the convenience needed to make your stay a memorable experience. The only big disappointment it was the ultra-obsoleted TV set.

The Landseer Restaurant is a hidden gem, with an absolutely surprising modern interpretation of British gastronomy. The staff were just great, the food were “State Of The Art” even if we have some special requests because of Lent until Easter. Quality cuisine and exceptional trained staff manage to compensate the partial lack of natural light. Somehow I have the feeling that the restaurant deserves a better place than the semi-basement, in the hotel.

The staff are true professionals in hospitality, always smiling, always chirpy. 
A special thanks to Mrs. Adriana from Reception for her kindness, and a huge THANK YOU to BLOOMSBURY & LANDSEER team.

115,My Stay At The Bloomsbury Was Wonderful!,"While on vacation with my husband and another couple, we stayed for one week at The Bloomsbury Hotel in London. It's only a few blocks from The British Museum and is very convienently located to shopping, great restaurants and many of the London sites that one would want to visit. The hotel is very elegantly decorated and our Studio Suite was beautiful. Dining at The Landseer Restaurant was very good, a hearty breakfast was included in our room package and we ate there each morning, the one evening dinner we had there was also delicious. The best thing about The Bloomsbury was the friendly, heplful and very knowledgable staff. I would not hesitate to recommend The Bloomsbury to family and friends. I'd say whether traveling for business or pleasure, you can't go wrong staying at The Bloomsbury!",5,2015,04,12
115,Theatre visit,"This hotel is in a superb location for the Dominion theatre,Covent Garden and Oxford Street. I stayed there with my mum and we were very impressed with the service we received and the quality of the hotel.A little bit of luxury and peacefulness right in the centre of London! We would definitely recommend it.",5,2015,04,12
115,Superb hotel!,"Stayed at this hotel with friends, great location! Rooms were immaculate with tasteful decor.Loved the interconnecting rooms - would be great for family's to! Staff were professional and extremely helpful. Had breakfast in the restaurant, food was excellent to. Would definitely return to this hotel!",5,2015,04,12
115,Amazing,"A really nice hotel with great service and a friendly staff, the food's delicious and both the concierge and the receptionist have been very helpful during our stay. The rooms are great, very organized and clean. The lobby is cozy and warm, beautifully designed.
I think it would be better if they had shampoo and shower soap for every guest.",5,2015,04,12
115,Ms. SUSAN NYC,"I just returned from a week stay at this gem of a hotel, Where I stayed with my kids and mom.It was so conveniently located to all, it was  up the street from British Museum and walking distance to many other sights, as well the theater distirict and Trafalgar Square. It was close by   from dozens of restaurants and 2 blocks from the Tube.
    It was beautifully decorated and just had a charming and homey feel.The entire staff was accommodating and beyond courteous. The staff, at the restaurant during breakfast, was so lovely and always aimed to please. Two of the breakfast staff we dealt with a lot during the week were named Bogdan and Estelita, who were always so welcoming and attentive. In addition, the restaurant served a delicious buffet breakfast with many options.
  I highly recommend this hotel for anyone who wants a homey friendly place to call home when in London. The rooms were clean and very comfortavbe. I can not say enough about my stay at this hotel. We will definitely return.",5,2015,04,11
115,Great hotel in convenient location,"This was our second stay at The Bloomsbury and it did not disappoint. We stayed for one night as we were on a theatre break. The staff were excellent, making us feel very welcome & relaxed as soon as you arrive.  We had the pre- theatre meal in the restaurant and both food and service we're great.  Our room was quite small but spotlessly clean and had everything we needed.  The location is so convenient for theatres, shopping & Covent garden. Would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2015,04,09
115,Amazing is the only word to use....,"Amazing hotel one of the best, service/staff were unbelievable so accommodating.  Fabulous experience would return again and again and again. Worth every penny.  Loved it.  I would recommend to anyone. Also the food in the hotel was fantastic again it was amazing.  Could not fault anything.",5,2015,04,08
115,A real Gem of a hotel,"I had the pleasure of yet another visit to the Bloomsbury for business last week. I am never disappointed by this hotel and the effort the team go to, making your stay memorable. After a quick checkin with a hot towel and complementary juice I made my way to my room on the fourth floor. A thoughtful welcome note was on the desk in my room acknowledging that the room had been made up to my own personal preferences of hypoallergenic bedding - without even having to request these on this occasion... I always look forward to a good nights sleep as the beds are epic! The hotel is very tastefully appointed, I especially love staying here in Winter as it also has a strong heritage flavour but with a contemporary spin. 
Breakfast is always a highlight thanks to the warm welcome of Estralita and Maria, the two always remember how I like my eggs and bacon even if I have a break of a few months between my visits. I recommend the eggs Benedict. 
I work in the fashion industry and love the location of the hotel for business in the westend and Soho. It never fails to disappoint the models and creative talent I employ - all are impressed by this place and look forward to returning. 
Thankyou Bloomsbury",5,2015,04,07
115,Great hotel for London break!,"I stayed here in March 2015 and had an excellent stay! Prior to arriving I had emailed the hotel to request a twin room as there was only a double choice on the website and they were happy to oblige! Hotel was lovely and would definitely recommend it! It was close to the tube station (Tottenham court road though this was partly closed when we were there for the central lines but hotel was approx a 10 min walk to Holborn) and a short walk most popular locations eg Oxford Circus and Covent Garden! Hotel staff were friendly and helpful! Rooms were lovely, modern and clean! Breakfast was delicious and there was a nice selection (we had a continental included)! Will definitely be back!",5,2015,04,07
115,"Nice, Quiet, Good Staff","Good boutique hotel.  Rooms were nice, clean, equivalent to a standard Marriott room. From American standpoint, rooms are small, but that's to be expected. 2 block walk to Tottenham Tube station. Easy walk to Soho, Picadilly Circus. 1 block from the British  museum. Good service. Always had clean towels. Quiet street in the heart of London.",4,2015,04,04
115,Overnight Stay,"We were in London to attend a private viewing of an art exhibition at a Gallery very close to The Bloomsbury.   As usual we had a lovely stay being made to feel very pampered by all the staff. We had drinks in the Landseer Bar before going out,we love the intimate feel in here, and ate a lovely meal in the restaurant when we got back. The Guinness bread, made in the hotel, was just delicious!   We will definitely be returning",5,2015,04,04
115,Best hotel staff ever!,"A treat for my daughter to celebrate her 12th birthday was ruined by her becoming unwell.  At 3am it became necessary to get her to a doctor at the nearest hospital then return home later that morning. The hotel staff were all extremely professional, polite and friendly from the moment we arrived but right when we really needed exceptional, caring, bespoke service they did took this to a new level.

We were both grateful and relieved to be looked after so well with care and sympathy away from home and the rest of our family.

Special thanks to Dharam Gutty night manager 😊

Needless to say we would not hesitate to head straight back to this beautiful hotel next time we stay in London.  In addition to the quality of the service this hotel ticks all the boxes when it comes to cleanliness, decor and location.",5,2015,04,03
115,Excellent Hotel - Good value,"I had stayed at the Bloomsbury a number of times before and enjoyed it, but I had a particularly good experience this trip.  I arrived very early and the (very welcoming) check-in staff arranged for me to have an early check-in with no fuss. The rooms had been re-decorated since my last stay  and there were touches like the in-room Nespresso machine (a real treat), a turn-down service (whihc replaced the towels and coffee pods (you'll see what matters to me)  and free wi-fi.  The building itself is historic and I liked another nice touch which is a little printed history of the building and the local area in the room. The biggest plus point for me was the price - I used the hotel's own website and got a pre-paid rate of £189 which is extremely good value for a hotel in this location. I was on business and I could walk to my meetings but it's also well placed for tourists. Strongly recommend",5,2015,04,03
115,"Great location, that's about it!","This hotel is in a great location if you want to be close to city centre, apart from that I don't rate this hotel at all.

My room was the size of a show box, the room was so hot that I never got a minutes sleep, I was that tired in the morning that I never even tried the breakfast, couldn't wait to get away from the place.

I definitely wouldn't recommend or stay there again.",1,2015,03,30
115,Cosy hotel close to the High Street,"Whenever I am in London, and there is space, I stay at The Bloomsbury. The staff are friendly and very helpful. Everything you need is in your room. There is a small and well-equiped gym if you like working out before work.
The Bloomsbury is definitely home away from home.",5,2015,03,30
115,Excellent,"Just returned from our first stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel and would highly recommend it.  We could find nothing to criticise.  The location is excellent, the hotel itself is spacious and elegant with an interesting history and lovely décor and the bedrooms and bathrooms are lovely (with the most comfortable pillows I have ever encountered in a hotel).  Everything you could want is provided, from bathrobes and slippers, through iron and ironing board (I love having one already in the room) to a nespresso machine and even an umbrella!  WiFi was free in the room and very easy to access.  The highlight though, was the staff who were, without exception, welcoming, helpful and friendly.  Breakfast was good with healthy options and taken in a calm, relaxed room which was never crowded, even at peak time.  Will certainly stay here again.",5,2015,03,30
115,40th Wedding Aniversary,"Stayed at this hotel over the weekend,fantastic location,very easy to get to covent garden,soho restaurants,and theatre,even with a poorly knee!!
Staff extremely helpful,nothing too much trouble,even the GM stopped and had a chat!!!
Beautiful room,with huge bed,and very good shower.
Thankyou for putting the icing on the cake on our anniversary weekend,will look forward to returning here on our next visit to town,
PS the champagne was delicious!!!!",5,2015,03,30
115,London birthday weekend,"What a fantastic weekend; the hotel staff were excellent and provided an exceptional service. The hotel was very clean as was our room, the room was well equipped and decorated to a high standard. We didn't take lunch or an evening meal in the hotel but we did take full advantage of the sumptuous breakfast. The Bloomsbury is located in a convenient part of London within a 5 minute walk of Oxford Street, Soho and the West End - perfect.",5,2015,03,30
115,Afternoon tea delight,"Went to Bloomsbury Hotel for a friend's birthday.  It wasn't straight forward finding where I needed to go yet luckily another friend arrived earlier and guided us to the Landseer bar & restaurant where the afternoon tea was taking place.  Once I got seated - it's was all fine and dandy.  The staff very friendly and helpful and as for the afternoon tea - bliss!  Cakes were fresh and yummy.  The tea flowed as wel as the bubbly - it was unlimited :-)
Definitely recommend if you want to do something different.",4,2015,03,30
115,Show Break,"Staff excellent, Hotel clean and inviting, bed so comfortable we wanted to take it home! On check out a free bottle of water to take with us. Has a gym and had we got more time would have liked to visited that too..",5,2015,03,29
115,"Elegant, warm, good position","Hotels in London... expensive, aren't they :-)
Well, I've stayed in 4-5 hotels in London and I can say that this IS a good hotel. Rooms though are not too big... but they are cozy.. and you feel good. Reception staff is half-half when it comes to kindness but quite efficient. 
There is something funny about the breakfast lol. If you want eggs... you have to pay and additional cost for it. Apart from that is a decent one. Another thing .. if you have a conference there and it is in the basement - wear a bikini. If you have it in a fancy conference room - take a coat. Quite cold there.
A tip: the top floor is best if you want a decent sleep because floors are wooden and sound are spreading nice :-)
The position is excellent if you want to have some excitements in Soho.. you don't need a taxi!",5,2015,03,28
115,A first class hotel,"The hotel is a lovely building.  It is in a great location,with so many places to visit within walking distance.  There are numerous restaurants within the surrounding area.  Although our room was not the biggest we've stayed in in London, it was well equipped and very comfortable.  Breakfast was very good, cooked to order.  There was an extensive range on the cold buffet.  The staff are wonderful, - friendly, helpful and committed to making sure that guests have everything they need.  Really enjoyed staying here and will definitely be back.",5,2015,03,28
115,Excellent location and attentive staff,"We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 nights booked through HotelTravel.com and there were no problems with the booking through this agent.

The hotel entrance has some steps leading up to the main door so if you have mobility problems you may want to check what other access options are offered in advance of your stay. 

The main lobby is very well set out, clean and attractive. All the staff we encountered in the hotel were very helpful and polite. Reception was efficient and friendly both for checking in and checking out and sorted out a minor problem on my bill before I even had a chance to ask about it. 

The restaurant (breakfast only) and bar were comfortable but I would have preferred decoration more in keeping with the age of the hotel. The breakfast was very good and was cooked to order.

The lifts were quick and efficient and you didn't feel you were waiting too long for one to arrive.

The rooms were well very comfortable, clean and well equipped. The lighting was very good compared to some hotels I have stayed in and the air conditioning very efficient. We had a superior room and felt this was on the small size compared to some hotels we have used locally but not over small for London. This may be in part due to the original use of the building before it became a hotel. We appreciated the nespresso machine and extra capsules were provided when requested. 

 ",4,2015,03,27
115,Location great...overpriced and rooms quite small,"Booked a group into this hotel for an office function so really glad I wasn't forking out £470 for our 3 bed 'suite'. The location is excellent for the West End, just off Tottenham Court road.
The rooms however are quite small, beds were short and the shower not adequate. The buffet breakfast was very good, even if the service a bit hit and miss. Would not recommend if you are on a budget",3,2015,03,25
115,Very comfortable hotel for solo traveler,"Stayed here two nights. Very nice room--still London small, but nicely appointed. Comfy bed.  Small but luxurious bathroom. Turndown service...alas no choc! But nice anyway. Nespresso machine. Very friendly staff arranged a cab for me to the Eurostar station. Great location for theatres, shopping & sightseeing. I would certainly stay again. ",5,2015,03,25
115,Great location!,"We stayed at this hotel for a weekend  break. It is in a fantastic location for Regent Street, Oxford Street, Soho and Covent Garden. The staff were great and the hotel very clean. My only criticism would be that the hotel was too warm, even when we turned the heating off in our room.",4,2015,03,24
115,First Class Hotel and Restaurant,"The last time I visited the Building it was under the control of the YWCA so a little surprised to find it was now a top class hotel. We found the staff to be very friendly helpful and attentive. Adriana dealt very proficiently with our requests in a very professional but friendly manner. The room was comfortable and well appointed, loved the coffee machine.
Eating dinner at the Landseer restaurant was a pleasant experience with good choices on the menu, again the staff here looked after us very well.",5,2015,03,24
115,Excellent restaurant and hotel,"The place is so good, fabulous food, staffs are very accommodating.We all have very enjoyable night. Thanks to Sir Paul and staff for the superb service. The hotel is centrally located-in the heart of London, very convenient to explore tourist spots, transport system are accessable. The London Museum is 3 to 5 minutes walk away. Over all it was a plesant experience for us.",5,2015,03,23
115,The staff make it a great stay!,"I have stayed at the Bloomsbury may times.

The Hotel itself is well maintained and clean, it's also in a perfect location to cover most of London's interesting attractions by foot or short cab ride... I wouldn't categorize it as 5 star as far as amenities and accommodation are concerned, but close. I would also say in all honest it's a bit pricey, especially in peak season.

However.. Why my family and I return to the hotel every year is the staff!  From front desk, to concierge, to bellmen, the Bloomsbury staff is ALWAYS pleasant, helpful, and are genuinely interested in making your stay a memorable and comfortable one.

The staff on several occasions has gone out of their way to assist me for show or football tickets, restaurant suggestions, attractions and traveling to, and have always made my children feel like royalty!",4,2015,03,23
115,"Reception staff, Location, Room","Adriana at reception was very welcoming. Adriana upgraded us to a bigger room.The room was excellent, plenty space, quiet.The BLOOMSBURY is a very comfortable hotel, breakfast is excellent with complimentary newspapers. Location is superb, close to Soho, Covent Garden and theatres. Overall a great and relaxing experience.",5,2015,03,22
115,Excellent hotel and location,"Please don't hesitate staying at this hotel its excellent. It has character and a soul and the location for the West End is superb. 

It's always refreshing to not stay in a chain like 'Hilton/Ramada' etc even if they are consistent. It is good to see how smaller businesses do things and this hotel was great.

Our room was large for London and the bathroom was excellent, the quality of the fittings made it stand out, you can feel, see and lie in luxury our room oozed it.

One of the doormen 'cockney' sounding had a bit of attitude and whilst it wasn't appreciated it didn't stop our enjoyment of this hotel.

A definite desire to stay here again.",5,2015,03,22
115,Good with some reservations,"Ordinarily I don't review a hotel until after the end of the stay. But in this case I am SO frustrated that I decided to register my opinion in mid-stay. Hopefully the management is paying attention. This is a very nice place to stay if you want to be in or near the Bloomsbury neighborhood. It is attractive and clean. But for the rates charged the level of service is frustrating. First of all, if you need internet connection, be prepared for dial up modem level speeds -- unbelievable for a hotel of this sort in a world class city. Also, they seem unprepared to handle guests -- there is a lovely breakfast, but only a skeleton crew of servers, that keep you waiting not only to be seated (in a nearly empty room) but also to get a simple cup of coffee. Is it so hard to allow guests to serve themselves in the 21st century? If you are here on business, come prepared with patience. It is odd why service should be so off in place so superficially appealing.",4,2015,03,20
115,Location and excellent service,"The hotel is located within walking distance from the subway station of Tottenham cout road spacious rooms include a coffee maker and a minibar rich.
 Efficient room service.
 Breakfast is varied, especially the English breakfast den.
 The staff are polite and happy to help with any questions.
 Hanged leave your bags shifts.
 Hotel near the museum and in the large selection of restaurants, cafes, and bars.",5,2015,03,18
115,Perfect Location,"The hotel is in an excellent location, two minutes from The British Museum, ten minutes from Covent Garden and just around the corner from Tottenham Court Road tube station. The hotel is very clean, rooms very comfortable with evening turn down service (complete with chocolate!), and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Concierge happy to book tickets for attractions (e.g. London Eye). Breakfast is a little expensive if on a room only rate but can be added to your room rate on arrival at a discounted rate from charging to your room each morning. Or there is a 24 hour cafe across the street!! I think the bar suffers from being on the lower ground floor, making it rather dark and quiet. The restaurant is also on the lower ground floor. Afternoon tea is obviously very popular. We dined here on one evening and the food was excellent but you are spoiled for choice with Covent Garden so close. Would certainly stay here again when in London.",4,2015,03,18
115,An almost-perfect hotel!,"? Perfect location,central yet quiet. 24h caffe across the street, all you need is nearby (including the ""primark"" store...). Stuff was more than superb & always helpfull. we booked the superior room, wich was perfect: spacy,large & comfortable bed,great bathroom treats. We got all we expected and more, they gave us treats in the room every day! The breakfast was great, afternoon tea was wonderfull, if they wern't so much expensive, we would have taken them on a daily basis, not just once as we did.",5,2015,03,17
115,"Very good hotel, great location","Visited The Bloomsbury Hotel on a business trip for 3 days. The hotel is near Oxford Street, London main shopping area, is very clean and the room size is acceptable for London standard. It is also close to Dominion Theatre as well the British Museum. The breakfast, sleep quality and service are good as well. The Price/Quality Ratio is high. Recommended",4,2015,03,17
115,A jewel of a joint!,"We recently held an Advisory Group meeting at the Bloomsbury Hotel, in the Heathcote Suite. We received an exceptional service, in a professional setting with a personal touch - would highly recommend!",5,2015,03,17
115,A fine hotel on a prime location,"With the Central and Northern Lines of the Underground, and Charing Cross Road and Oxford Street round the corner, this is the ideal location for visiting London. The hotel is very well appointed, with all the amenities one could reasonably expect, and very pleasant staff.",5,2015,03,17
115,"Great Hotel with a history, great location","I chose this hotel because I wanted to be as close as possible to the Dominion Theater ( a 5 minute walk) The hotel is very good located, very close to an underground station and close to the British museum. The room and bathroom was very clean and nice equipped. Tea, coffee maker, free wifi, nice tv with a lot of channels, bathrobe and so on. I loved the booklet that they have in the room that gives a short history of the building. The building has a very intersting history and it would be a shame to stay there and not know about it.
I will definitely stay again at this hotel.",5,2015,03,17
115,Great food and place,"We had booked for dinner with friends and coworker's, they were impressed with the place, the service provided by the staff who are very helpful and doesn't hesitate to help.

The food taste great, Thanks to Sir Paul and staff who prepared the tasty treat to our palate which after eating it you feel very satisfied.",5,2015,03,16
115,"Perfect location, very good service.","I stayed here for five nights, I choose this  hotel because I love the aerea.You have all you need in the surroundings:shops, underground, theaters and more.
The room  was a king deluxe double, and was great for the english standard.The bed and the pillows are so comfortable that it is very hard to wake in the morning.The atmosphere in the entire hotel is so elegant.Everyone does a great job.
Breakfast is gorgeous, in my opinion anyone can find something to satisfy his palate, the staff is great and very helpful.Cappuccino is incredible.",4,2015,03,15
115,Great hotel - sensational breakfast,"This is an excellent four star hotel which does all of the important things right and has a particularly spectacular breakfast for those for whom this meal is the most important of the day.  The rooms are good and the staff friendly, courteous and helpful.  The hot towel on check in was a first for me; just the thing after travelling by train from Heathrow.

Great Russell street goes upmarket as you move from west to east and the Bloomsbury is close to the western and tackier Tottenham Court Road end, but if you don’t mind the Thai massage shops, the nearby YMCA and being adjacent to what looks like the warehouse of the nearby Dominion Theatre the Bloomsbury’s location is hard to beat being within ten to fifteen minutes by foot of most of the main west end shows plus Covent Garden, the English National Opera, the National Theatre, the National Gallery and the British Museum to name but a few.

Hotel rooms in central London do not tend to be generous in size.  We had a “superior” room at the back of the hotel which was blissfully quiet with a large and comfortable bed.  The room was modern, well-appointed and even had reasonably good, if fiddly, bedside reading lights – something sorely lacking in many otherwise admirable hotels.  My only quibble was a rather cramped bathroom, but it was clean and functional.

However the thing that really impressed us was the breakfast.  At £26 the full breakfast does not come cheap (there is a buffet for £18.50), but some of the hot meals on offer such as the superfood salads not only set you up for the day, but are delicious to boot.  And it is nice to find a hotel that knows how to make a proper eggs Florentine at eight in the morning.  We found that having filled ourselves at breakfast, we did not need to eat anything bar a small sandwich for the remainder of the day.  A good selection newspapers is available for free.  The weak points are the coffee which is mediocre and the hot chocolate which was sweet to the point of undrinkability –two shortcomings which would be easy to fix.  The tea is fine. 

We will be back.",5,2015,03,12
115,best dinning experience Ive had in a while,"this place is fantastic for mayor events in London - well done guys, I believe its down to Daniel Clifford's Seasoned events magic that made it go so well. the décor and lighting aren't too bad either but apart from a  snooty area manager sniffing about being critical this was one of the best dinning experiences I've had in years. highly recommended.",5,2015,03,12
115,"Great stay, even better service once i'd left!","Recently stayed here for a nice weekend break. Great Hotel, great location. I must mention Eileen Dennis who, after I had left a couple of items in the room after i left, sorted it all out and got them sent back to me. She is a star and you need to keep hold of her!!",5,2015,03,12
115,First class hotel,"My husband and I had a relaxing time at the Bloomsbury Hotel this weekend. I managed to catch up on all the lost sleep from the week. The hotel room was perfect with an extremely comfortable bed and pillows. The room was also devoid of the usual London street noise despite being right in the hub of night time activity. The attention to detail and politeness of the staff was evident upon entering the hotel, reservation desk through to the restaurant area. ",5,2015,03,09
115,Great service.,"The first time I've taken the time to leave a review on Trip Advisor but the service at this hotel was so good I need to say something. The staff were all incredibly helpful, cheerful and friendly and made our stay straightforward and relaxing. The hotel has a very calm, relaxing atmosphere. Great breakfast. Lots of nice touches in the room - good hairdryer (not one of those horrid ones attached to the bathroom wall!) - iron and ironing board, well stocked tray for making tea and coffee. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,03,08
115,Amazing Afternoon Tea,Visited last week and took advantage of their offer of free flow Afternoon Tea. The place was busy and had a great atmosphere.  Cakes were gorgeous and Mr Joao looked after us very well and kept on topping up our glasses!,5,2015,03,07
115,Opulence in the centre of action,I am wowed! It is a stone throw away from some great scenic sights.  And there is a theatre besides it.  Love the quiet from the bustling streets.  And love that we are in the centre of actions where there are many things to do.  The staff are fantastic.  I was given great attention and assistance.  A great find indeed!,4,2015,03,05
115,Excellent hotel with brilliant staff,"I would highly recommend this hotel. Lovely, clean, staff are very polite and make you feel very welcome. It is in a brilliant location with a tube station just around the corner and a lot of the main attractions are just a 5minute walk away. I will definitely be visiting this hotel again.",5,2015,03,05
115,Great,"The staff were friendly, attentive, and efficient. The room was nicely decorated, clean, and comfortable. Definitely coming back! Also, the juices (available to order) were both healthy and DELICIOUS! 
              ",5,2015,03,03
115,Beautiful hotel,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we departed the staff were brilliant, could not fault this hotel or staff at all. The rooms were lovely and the food was also very good. I will definitely be returning, thank you to all the lovely staff for the warm welcome.",5,2015,03,01
115,A little gem! ,"Found this hotel on late rooms. We were looking for somewhere near to Leicester Square/ Covent Garden . It's a good 10 min walk, just perfect! It's tucked in a street behind the Dominion Theatre. There is an Ncp car park more or less opposite. £38 for 24 hrs. We stayed for one night . This hotel was lovely and quiet. The beautiful scents as you walk in are smelt all around the hotel. Very clean.Staff were very attentive. We were given an upgrade too on arrival! Room was lovely. Gowns/ slippers provided , also free bottled water , which had been replaced when we returned to our room in the evening. Beds were turned too. 
We had drinks in the bar before we went out. Reasonable priced I felt. £7.50 for a glass of wine, £13 for a cocktail. Again very relaxed atmosphere, in fact we stayed here until 11.30 before walking to Leicester Square . The barman was brilliant.  
Breakfast was good, cooked to order . We payed £18 each when we arrived for this . 
Only negative was with our bill, we were charged for the room which we had already payed for , but this was soon rectified. Would definitely recommend and will definitely be back. ",5,2015,02,26
115,Amazing stay,"Everything was wonderful. Smart reception area, friendly staff who are all on the ball. I stayed in a deluxe room which was big and had everything we needed, loved the coffee machine and the slippers were so comfy as were the beds. We asked for a twin which isn't obviously from the website that it is an option but it is. Great service at the bar downstairs. Loved the location as we managed a quick visit to the British museum before our train home Monday morning which was a 5 min walk. We walked to the theatre district very easily also from the hotel. ",5,2015,02,25
115,Lovely Anniversary Stay,"The staff went out of their way to help and made the whole experience feel extra special.
The room was immaculate, modern and well presented.  We will visit again and will definitely have the Afternoon Tea Experience as it looked wonderful.
",5,2015,02,23
115,Great Weekend,"Just returned from a great stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel. The whole experience was 1st class. The reception were excellent as were all members of staff, the room was spotless and very comfortable and well decorated. Breakfast was really good and served in a warm & friendly environment with plenty of choices.
On checking out the concierge was extremley helpfull giving me directions to avoid all the traffic congestion. All in all a great finish to a fantastic stay",5,2015,02,23
115,Excellent Service,We had a very nice stay at the Bloomsbury. The hotel staff is excellent. We liked our room but found the plumbing in the bathroom to be a bit noisy during the night. We would consider staying here in the future. The hotel Internet is free and fast.,4,2015,02,21
115,Fantastic,"Me and my Fiance stayed here over the Valentine's weekend, it is brilliantly located within walking distance to Leicester Square, Covent Garden and Oxford Street and a 2 minute walk to Tottenham Court Tube Station!

We were greeted on arrial with fresh hot towels which was a pleasent and to our suprise at 12:30 our room was all ready for us to check in! The room was lovely and spacious, clean and a good sized bathroom too! 

We went out exploring for the day and came back to a lovely bottle of Champagne in our room then after  going out for dinner we came back to a 'romantic turndown' which the bed was covered in petals which was a lovely touch! 

Breakfast the Sunday was lovely, fresh pastries, fruit, cereals and juices followed by a good English Breakfast! 

I would throroughly recommend this Hotel and we will definitley stay again!",5,2015,02,20
115,"A cocktail of exceptional customer service, great food and tastefully furnished, comfortable rooms...","My partner and I stayed 14-16th February. First of all, what a fantastic location. 2 mins walk from Tottenham Court Road Underground Station and Oxford Street, walking distance to Covent Garden. Our first night was in a Superior Room which was lovely and comfortable, though we were rudely awoken by some inconsiderate neighbouring guests at 5am who thought it was acceptable to bring friends back and party, loudly. Following a quick call to reception to report this, a gentleman arrived right away to speak politely but sternly to the guests about their behaviour and to have their non-paying 'guests' leave. After a good 15-20 mins, the guest were gone and all was quiet again, but sleep we could not. After planning the weekend for some time, I felt our disturbed first night and lack of sleep had completely tarnished a romantic weekend. I was tired, angry, upset and distressed and I decided to visit reception where I spoke to the Guest Relations Manager, Malaka. Before mentioning any room number or name, a very professional Malaka greeted me by surname and immediately apologised for the inconvenience, assuring me that the neighbouring guests had now left and that we were to receive a complimentary meal and room upgrade as a 'small' gesture. Well what can I say... my tired, angry, upset and distressed self suddenly became a content, reassured and excited self as if my magic, so a big thank you to Malaka for the professional and efficient manner in which the matter was dealt with as it went on to be the thoroughly enjoyable weekend it was meant to be and more!
The second night was in a Junior Suite on the 8th Floor (801) which included a beautiful bathroom with double basin, separate bath and shower, dressing room, chaise longue and large tv. Plenty of space to move around too!

We ordered room service which was simply delightful - a very tasty lobster bisque and battered sea bass and chips and a Pertshire Blue 9oz Steak with béarnaise sauce - wow! Melt in the mouth.

Full breakfast was included in our room rate, of which we tried the Full English and Eggs Royale from the hot dishes, as well as the continental buffet - All very nice and plenty of choice on the buffet, which we thought was one of the better ones we've seen in hotels. The breakfast host, whose name surpasses me, was very welcoming and efficient. 

All of the staff at the hotel were very professional and pleasant. The hotel decor was tasteful throughout and it really felt like home - a shame that we didn't book to stay longer. We will without doubt be staying at the Bloomsbury Hotel again.",5,2015,02,18
115,Fantastic location,"Stayed here for a weekend to see a show. Location was perfect, hotel was clean and warm. Rooms a little small but thats what you expect in London but perfectly suited to our needs. Would definitely stay again.",5,2015,02,18
115,3rd stay at this lovely hotel ,"Myself and my husband were in London for one night as seeing an exhibition. We arrived at about 6pm and found our room on the 7th floor and although very small it was beautiful and what we have found to expect from the Bloomsbury. The bathroom was tiny though literally had to go in, close the door to find the toilet which was tucked behind the door! This didn't put us off as we were only staying one night but anymore and would think it would become annoying. Also because the bathroom was so small when you showered in the bath the water splashed everywhere so don't leave anything you don't want to get wet ! 
We ate in the hotel restaurant where once again the food was delicious but the service was a little slow and not as attentive as last time we ate there. We then moved on to the hotel bar we we had some lovely cocktails which we enjoyed watching being made. 
We overslept so didn't have time to really enjoy our breakfast ( our fault ) but it was tasty as always but again we found the staff were not as attentive as our previous stays.
Will we return? Yes. ",4,2015,02,18
115,Love this hotel,Visited the hotel last weekend with my husband. This is our 5th visit and as always the hotel is wonderful. The staff are always so friendly and we checked in early no problem. The bar is somewhere to go to relax. We love this hotel.,5,2015,02,16
115,Excellent hotel great location,"Lovely hotel, we had a standard room but it had all the luxuries we needed and the room was clean and nicely decorated and the nespresso coffee machine was a welcome surprise. Only slight negative was that the bathroom was quite small but again it was very well presented and had all the extras like mini toiletries so size didn't really matter.

There was lots of choice at breakfast and the cooked breakfast was of a high standard. 

The rest of the hotel again was of a very high standard and we couldn't fault the service in the bar or reception.

The location was brilliant only 5-10 mins walk to Leicester square and Covent garden and just around the corner from Oxford street and Holborn tube station.",5,2015,02,16
115,Perfect location at a perfect price!,"Booked the Bloomsbury hotel to spend the valentines weekend in London with my fiance and was not disappointed. Did some research before booking, as we have never stayed in London before and wanted a central location which was moderately priced with good TripAdvisor reviews. The Bloomsbury ticked all of the boxes. 

The hotel itself is in a fantastic location just a stones throw from Tottenham Court Road tube station and walking distance to Leicester Square and Covent Garden. 

Staff at the Bloomsbury are a real credit to the hotel. So attentive and can't do enough for you. 

We stayed in a Superior room with a queen size bed and was really impressed by how perfect it was for a London break. Spotless, spacious and modern. In addition to the room, I added the romance package which included breakfast, a bottle of Moet champagne and a romantic turn down, which included rose petals on the bed. Breakfast the next morning was great, with lots of options for suit everyone. 

Overall we had an amazing time and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Bloomsbury. We will be definitely recommending it to all of our friends and family.",5,2015,02,16
115,Shopping trip,"Heard about this hotel from some friends , they told me it was in a great location at really sensible rates, rooms were clean , warm and spacious and modern , what a great find , everyone cares and makes you feel special ,, the Resterant has some great food at really attractive prices , Therter land is a short interesting walk away , the basement bar has a great wine offering with staff that no how to serve wine as well as make beautiful cocktails , I will be going back to the Bloomsbury , underground is less than 5 mins away and Oxford street shopping is as close as the underground station , this place has everything for everybody , business or pleasure ..",5,2015,02,15
115,Champagne afternoon tea,A wonderful champagne afternoon tea to celebrate joint 50th and 21st birthdays - much better than afternoon tea at Fortnums the week before!!. Excellent friendly service. Plenty of fresh sandwiches and cakes and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The 'free flowing champagne was certainly free flowing!! Thank you so much for a wonderful afternoon.,5,2015,02,15
115,"Beautiful hotel, shame about the service","Stayed in the luxury suite of the Bloomsbury the night of Valentines with my husband. We arrive late after work and were really impressed by the spotless room, gorgeous bathroom and incredibly comfy bed.
However at £400 a night we expected to be well looked after. After waiting on the phone whilst it rang out for 15 minutes someone eventually answered and said they would bring up a bottle opener...this took 20 minutes.
Then at breakfast we had to wait again, 3 staff manically ran around the large dining area trying to serve 15 tables (a third of the capacity), we had to grab someone's attention to take our order, we were served toast with no butter, so that went cold and the staff just seemed frantic. You wouldn't mind this in a 3 star place but for £400 it's just a bit of a joke.
Such a shame because the hotel is so lovely just doesn't seem to have enough staff to run it.",3,2015,02,15
115,Excellent Afternoon Tea!,"Just had to write a review about my afternoon tea at The Bloomsbury Hotel. I wasn't sure what to expect - £35 for an unlimited Ridgeview Bloomsbury sparkling wine afternoon tea. I was extremely impressed - the sparkling wine was excellent and there was a huge selection of cakes. The sandwiches were not really to my taste, but there was nothing else to fault. 
I have been to almost all of the 'big' 5 star London hotels for afternoon tea but the service at The Bloomsbury Hotel was probably the best. My waiter, Joao, was absolutely brilliant - a real gem! I only write reviews if the service or quality of food is of an extremely high standard - well here, the service was impeccable. Well done Joao! I will certainly return - very soon!",5,2015,02,13
115,Top class hotel ideal location,"Picked the Bloomsbury for its ideal central location and was not disappointed. From the offer of warm towels on check in to the complimentary bottle of water on check out, the service and quality of the hotel room & food & service was excellent.",5,2015,02,12
115,Excellent hotel for my husbands birthday trip to the theatre,Beautiful hotel. Staff very friendly. Left a lovely surprise in the room as was my husbands birthday. Great location for theatres and soho. Rooms were beautifully decorated and very clean. Loved the dressing gown and slippers ,5,2015,02,12
115,Great Hotel - Awesome Bar,"The Hotel is not only comfortable but the service is exceptional.  The rooms are small and I found my room to be on the chilly side (Temperature wise), but I never brought it to anybodies attention.  However, the rooms are clean comfortable and have all the amenities you could wish for.

I really liked some of the small touches in their rooms such as multiple international socket options.  Service in the entire Hotel is exceptional and you see that staff are committed to keep everyone comfortable.  

The Hotel Bar is superior for customer meetings, drinks or romantic get together.  Joel is one of the best bartenders I have met (and I have met many).  Next time in London I will make a point of visiting the bar even if I am not staying at the Hotel.",5,2015,02,12
115,Great hotel - exceptional bar,I stayed at this hotel while attending a conference. The hotel was in a word great. The rooms are a bit on the small side but very comfortable. The inclusion of a European electric socket in the room was a nice touch. As good as the hotel and hotel staff was the bar and the service at the bar really stands out for me as an exceptional experience. The atmosphere and drinks selection at the bar was great and Joel and Alina took such excellent care of us the two nights we spent in the bar that the next time I am in London I will make it a priority to go back for a few drinks there even if i am staying in a different hotel. The bar is a hidden gem that everyone should experience.,5,2015,02,11
115,"""A Weekend to remember""","Just back from a weekend in London staying at the Bloomsbury celebrating a birthday. Went to Cats and enjoyed the show especially Nicole Scherzinger as Grisabella. Enjoyed a wonderful pre show dinner in the Landseer Restuarant at the hotel with wonderful food and exceptional service and enjoyed a drink in the bar after with Joelle looking after us so well.
We were delighted to have received a room upgrade and all the staff without exception could not have be kinder - definitely a palce we will return to soon - highly recommended",5,2015,02,09
115,Best hotel in London,"What can you say about a WOW hotel?  The Bloomsbury is exceptional in everything they do.  The staff is professional, courteous, friendly and goes above and beyond your expectations.  The guest suite is fabulous and always welcoming after a long day! Keep up the good work.",5,2015,02,09
115,Nice Hotel but............,"Nice hotel, clean, friendly staff but two things let is down.  The hotel was not very warm in our room (205) and the breakfast was not up to standard.  The hotel provide a chef at breakfast to cook orders freshly but one particular breakfast was not cooked well, the bacon had been cooked since around 6am - and could not be eaten.  We did complain at the time and were advised to report here.",3,2015,02,09
115,Good Location,"We have just returned from a two night stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel. We originally booked a standard room via a well known online booking agency. When we arrived at reception the friendly  receptionist looked at my husband, who is 6'4"" tall and explained that we may want to upgrade as the beds in the standard rooms were not really made for somebody of my husbands stature. She explained that we could look at the standard room and if we wanted to upgrade we could. Having just arrived on a very cold day we just wanted to settle into a room so took her advice and upgraded. We were upgraded to a Superior Room with a Kingsize bed. 

The Superior room is well equipped and the bed was very comfortable. We ate at the hotel restaurant on our first evening and the service was very good as was the food. However, I do feel that the price of all of the drinks was on the expensive side.  Over £10.00 for a gin and tonic and £5.00 for a cup of coffee. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel as again we felt £26.00 per person per night was expensive and as we were so close to lots of independent cafes etc we chose to eat breakfast elsewhere.

Overall the hotel is in a great location and the staff were friendly and efficient. We would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,02,08
115,Disappointed,"Aesthetically the hotel is wonderful. The bed was semi comfortable and the room looked nice. Unfortunately the air conditioning was faulty and intermittent throughout the night. 

We rang reception and informed them in the morning and complained at checkout. No compensation was offered - just a mere 'thank you' for letting them know the problem. Even at a discounted total of 170 pounds I felt we were robbed of a warm and uninterrupted nights sleep. 

Overall disappointed with the customer service. ",2,2015,02,06
115,Superior service on all fronts,"Where shall I start. This is the 5th year in a row I have stayed at The Bloomsbury for an annual conference. I am a Platinum member of a superior global hotel chain and I spend over 100 nights per year travelling so I know the difference between good and exceptional service. I am a light sleeper and had requested the same quiet room I had last time.The room was blocked for me and thankfully so, as I was ill the whole time I was here needing to sleep between conference sessions. I have to especially thank housekeeping and the managers on duty for looking after me. I had to change rooms for the last two nights and had forgotten a rather expensive razor in my previous room. I had mentioned this at the desk and went for a bite to eat and when I came back it was in my room, Didn't have to ask twice or track it down. The staff I met were genuinely concerned how I was as they knew I had been ill. I must note I had left my safe opened once when I left the room and housekeeping had come and nothing was gone others staying here told me they left money for housekeeping but no note so the money was not taken ( I did tell them you have to leave a note). The service level at the Bloomsbury is on par with the best anywhere and the Bloomsbury is a lovely respite in the heart of London to be sure. I look forward to my next stay and my try The Doyle Collection in NYC!",5,2015,02,06
115,A great family stay,Just before Christmas we stayed here as a family with my three children. We were made to feel very welcome from the moment we walked in the door. The location is very convenient for Covent Garden and Oxford Street. We had a great room and the breakfast had something for all of us. We would definitely stay again.,5,2015,02,04
115,"Excellent service, facilities and room","My wife and I stayed in the Bloomsbury for the third time from Thursday 29th January to Tuesday 3rd February and had a excellent relaxing time. All staff were very polite, attentive when required and provided an excellent level of service. We stayed in Room 514 which is a studio suite. The room is well equipped with a nice seating area, large TV, and a very comfortable large bed. The bathroom has a roll-top bath, walk-in shower and toilet. I'm currently using a single crutch to aid walking as I recover from an accident that occurred in August 2014. The layout and facilities in the room met all my needs. We used the restaurant for lunch on one day, dinner on one night and breakfast each day. The food and wine were of a good standard and the breakfast was very good with an extensive hot food menu and buffet available. We had a few visits to the bar for a post dinner drink and I can recommend the excellently spiced Bloody Mary. I also used the gym facilities once or twice each day which met my recovery plan needs which involves using a static bike and stretching exercises. We look forward to staying here again.",5,2015,02,04
115,Another Great Stay,We stayed at the Bloomsbury for two nights last weekend in suite 521.  I specifically requested this room as we had stayed in it before and thought it was wonderful.  The room is a high floor corner room which has three large windows that when the sun is out let in lots of lovely light.  The bathroom is enormous with a stand alone bath and separate shower stall.  The bed is extremely comfortable and warm and there are two large easy chairs to relax in too.  The suite is well equipped with all the amenities you would need for a comfortable stay.  All the staff members we encountered were very welcoming and took the time to engage in conversation with us.  I would most definitely recommend this hotel and look forward to an excuse to book another weekend there.,5,2015,02,03
115,Convenient and lovely,"We chose the Bloomsbury for its location - (walking distance to British Museum, Oxford Street, Soho, China Town, Leicester Square, Piccadilly, Shaftesbury Avenue, Covent Garden) - but you may want to know in advance that the nearest tube station (Tottenham Court Road) is closed on the Central Line for refurbishments till DECEMBER 2015, as we were caught out.  (Tottenham Court Road tube IS open on the Northern line however).

The hotel itself is lovely and the staff are very welcoming and helpful.  The room (a superior room) was stylish and comfortable and was well-equipped.  The only thing I would mention is that the basin in the bathroom was free standing and quite small so there was nowhere to put your toiletries/makeup - but the hotel DO supply bathrobes and slippers so perhaps it balances out.

We decided not to eat at the hotel and went for a room only rate, which seemed a good decision, since a tea in the hotel bar one evening cost us £5.00 each.  If you do decide to do bed and breakfast, make sure you book the rate in advance or pay at reception on arrival as the price is at least a fiver extra if you pay at breakfast each day.  There are plenty of places to eat breakfast though - just a short walk away, at roughly half the price, if you'd sooner save your money for London's attractions instead.  Enjoy your stay.",4,2015,02,02
115,Top notch,"Really amazing hotel in a great location. Staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. Stay for the breakfast, delicious with an extensive range. Nespresso coffee machine in my room! Tottenham Court Road tube right around the corner, and situated in a really lovely neighbourhood.",5,2015,01,30
115,Fabulous hotel !!  A real diamond !,"Home away from home !!  Lovely and comfortable and the most tasty breakfast !!
Gorgeously welcoming staff especially our very good friend Joel in the lovely bar down stairs.   
Would highly recommend as a central London city break 
Enjoy !!",5,2015,01,29
115,Love the barman!,What a lovely hotel. Bet comfortable rooms and fantastic restaurant and bat. Great service with he staff knowing my name. And in particular I adore Joel! What a great guy and amazing barman! I definitely recommend the Bloomsbury. X,5,2015,01,29
115,Stayed at the Bloomsbury on 31/1/15,"Third time staying here. I had booked a superior room and was lucky to have it upgraded to a Deluxe rooom. Rooms are superb, each Concierge was more than helpful. Gunilla the reception manager was exceptionally he;pful and conscientious. My wifge loves this hotel as it does not have that clinical buisness hotel feel to it but rather combines a relaxed, warm homeliness feeling with a quiet, understated efficiency. Rooms are superb and decorated to a very high standard.  ",5,2015,01,29
115,Amazing weekend ,"Since I love London I've convinced my best friend to come with me to do shopping in London, and since it was her first time in London I've decided to book the best hotel on Oxford area. 
From our first moment everyone in the staff was great, friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and we had  free WiFi. 
Breakfast was amazing lots of options. 
I'm definitely be coming again to this hotel and recommend it to my friends.

115,Terrific service,"This is the third or fourth time I've stayed here and I haven't been disappointed yet. This time, we were given a lovely room usual but where the sash window was making a knocking noise throughout the night. I didn't get much sleep, so, bleary eyed, I spoke about it to the guest relations manager the next morning. She was incredibly efficient and, instead of just sending someone up to check/fix the window, she offered us the junior suite. Wow! It was huge and luxurious (it even had a TV screen embedded in the wall above the bathtub...). We went out for the day and when we came back, the manager had left two little mince pies in our room with a note of apology. This level of attention to detail is why we will be coming back again and again. I will never tire of the courtesy and service offered here.",5,2015,01,26
115,Superb hotel with world class service rarely seen in London,"Just enjoyed 3 nights at the superb Bloomsbury Hotel. I would highly recommend it. The service from all the staff was world class which as we all know is rarely seen in London or the rest of the UK. The bar manager was fantastic - with 35 years of experience and his recommendations on wine and cocktails was first class. Rooms - very quiet clean and with nice individual touches. Restaurant food was amazing. The restaurant atmosphere not the best but we ate in the bar with the super bar manager and his supporting staff making my stay the best experience in London.
Well done Bloomsbury and yhe Doyle - I will be back soon ",5,2015,01,24
115,Fantastic experience!,"We stayed there for only two days, but we will come back any time! Clean, tastefull decorated, silent, good location, helpfull staff and the best morning buffet I ever had. Plus they surprised us with a free delicius birthdaycake on my boyfriends birthday!",5,2015,01,22
115,Top class consistently,"Third time staying at the bloomsbury, each visit has been consistently top class, excellent location, lovely rooms, staff are very friendly knowledgeable and courteous, great to walk in from the hustle and bustle of london to the peaceful and cosy atmosphere of the hotel,breakfast is a superb dining experience, great choice , great sausages for us sausage lovers, have stayed in lots of hotels and this hotel is my favourite, worth every penny.",5,2015,01,22
115,Excellent again,"Visited this hotel for the second time for two nights from Friday the 16th January 2015.  We were a party of four. The rooms are of a very high standard, comfortable and impeccable. The staff are a credit to the hotel. Breakfast was superb. Loads of choice and everything of a very high quality. The location of the hotel is excellent three minutes from tube and a fantastic variety of pubs and restaurants within walking distance. Hope to return later this year.",5,2015,01,20
115,Delightful treat,"  It is a little too expensive for me but I always choose to stay here.  When I visit London, usually I have accomplished something that needs a lot of work and effort, and I always regard stays in the Bloomsbury Hotel as a good reward and exquisite treat to myself.  Everything is excellent here.  I feel safe and relaxed.  
  Breakfast is superb.  Usually my plan includes continental type breakfast.  This 'continental' is not what other hotels serve as 'continental' breakfast.  There are a great variety of choices: vegetables, fruits, ham, yogurt, pies and something to nibble.  Even if you stay for several nights, you cannot try all.  This time my plan included hot food from the kitchen.  Omelette for the first morning, egg benedict for the second and salad...  all were really nice.  I want to try full English breakfast next time, but omelette and others are too tempting.   The staff is very kind and helpful!
  There was in the room a small book on the history of the Bloomsbury Hotel.  This is very charming.  On my next visit I intend to visit the library.  ",5,2015,01,20
115,Excellent from start to finish and absolute must.,"I booked The Bloomsbury Hotel for a weekend break to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday, the weekend after New Year.  Over the years we have stayed in a few London Hotels and they have been ok, but The Bloomsbury was exceptional.  We were made to feel so welcome from arrival to departure.  Our room was fantastic, roomy and spotlessly clean.  I had pre-arranged a bottle of Champagne to be left in the room on arrival, the hotel went one better and there was a cake and card from the staff as well - a lovely touch.  At breakfast the following morning, which was probably one of the best we have had, my husband was wished a 'happy birthday' by the staff.
The concierge staff at The Bloomsbury were so helpful also, there wasn't anything they didn't know.  A special mention goes to Brian head of concierge, what a lovely gentleman it was a pleasure to have met him.
In all this hotel is a diamond, in great location with wonderful staff. Stay here, you'll love it.",5,2015,01,19
115,Stay here in London!,"Great location and a Devine smell as you walk in to reception! 

One of the largest hotel rooms I've ever had in London, topped with lovely touches such as a nespresso machine.

Plentiful breakfast and friendly efficient staff. 

Will return. ",5,2015,01,18
115,Fantastic hotel in great location!,"We recently spent 3 nights in the bloomsbury hotel, and were impressed by the hotels superb staff and excellent location.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by Gunilla who was both pleasant and courteous. The head concierge Brian was also extremely helpful, providing us with fantastic advice which greatly enhanced our experience in London- his knowledge of various tourist attractions, restaurants, theatres etc. is extensive while his friendly demeanor was consistent with all the staff in the hotel. 

The Bloomsbury is an outstanding hotel in a prime location. It has a subtle elegance about it which is complemented by comfort, luxury, and professional yet friendly staff!",5,2015,01,14
115,Not to bad ,"Well I stayed in  another  hotel 6 months ago  at double  the cost  and  I'm happy to  say this was a far superior  stay. 
Though  I found  the odd  cleaning  oops I was comfortable  in the  super soft  bed, the room facilities met  expectations,with the  bed turn down  a nice unexpected  touch. The room did the job.
The reception smelt  delightful  as the waft of the scented candles  drifted through and the sofas  were really welcoming. The staff efficient and quick.
The breakfast  was ok though  not my choice. ..but that's me . There  was  lots on offer for you to  chose. ..
For a London City hotel  it's good  and yes  I had a good stay in my room on the 4th floor ..... my colleges on the 5th floor did complain about  knocking pipes and  water  sounds. .me I heard  nothing it was like  I had the  floor  to  myself .
Give it a go the staff seem really  helpful from observation as well .
I just  went slept and left .",5,2015,01,13
115,Outstanding as usual,Comfortable stay with very friendly and helpful staff. Spotlessly clean room. Pre Theatre dinner excellent value for money and a post theatre cocktail in the relaxed bar is a must. Also the location is perfect for theatres  and museums. Can't wait for an excuse to book in again.,5,2015,01,11
115,"Nice and luxury hotel, with very small rooms though","This is a very beautiful and comfortable hotel. You will love the atmosphere. The rooms are very very small though. I could barely fit in the bathroom. This is very common in London hotels. 
Breakfast is too expensive for what you get.",4,2015,01,10
115,Our stay at Bloomsbury hotel,"Decided to book in at the lovely Bloomsbury hotel for the New Years eve celebrations in London, on first sight of the hotel from the outside I just knew the inside of the was going to be awesome and was not disappointed as we walked through the entrance.

The staff and check in was a very friendly breeze and offered a glass of tasty mulled wine which was a very nice gesture along with the offer to assist us to our room.

Our delux room was spacious, nicely decorated and warm, bed was comfy and bathroom very clean and decor as you would expect with this high quality hotel, one thing I would mention is how quiet it was in the room.

As you would expect, was a late night out in London town and check out was around 11am and was no hurry to exit and left around midday, so nice not to be hurried out.

Will definitely stay again at the Bloomsbury with no hesitations whatsoever.

Thank you for a lovely stay, see you soon.",5,2015,01,07
115,Great promise of a hotel!,Beautiful hotel but disappointed with room 528. Booked a superior room but it was really  quite small with only an adequate bathroom and poor shower. Not very good value for the price but staff were attentive and the general atmosphere in the hotel lifts the spirits and that counts for a lot. ,4,2015,01,07
115,Great Location,Lovely hotel in a great location. Rooms are small but nicely decorated. Friendly staff. Clean rooms. Bit pricey as have stayed in just as nice hotels for less. Shower was not easy to get to required water temperature. I would stay at this hotel again because of location.,4,2015,01,06
115,Weekend in London,"Bloomsbury Hotel was an excellent location, close to Tottenham station. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. We included a full breakfast with our accomodation and were not disappointed there was an excellent selection for all people.
The location was close to all the theatres and SoHo for restaurants all within walking distance.
The room was what we expected. The bathroom flooring was heated which was nice in winter. The bed was very comfortable, it also had an espresso  machine in the room for good coffee not instant which was a nice touch.
The only small problem was that there was no power point near a mirror for my partner to style her hair. 
I would definitely stay at the Bloosbury Hotel again if I was coming to London.",5,2015,01,04
115,Great Hotel.,"Stayed here over New Year. Very comfortable and quiet. Has an old world charm and the staff were very polite and obliging.

There was a wide range of food at breakfast , all freshly prepared and, as it was New Years Day a complimentary glass off bubbly.

Only one very minute point - only two small cartons of milk in the room, but it was unimportant that I did not contact room service - otherwise no complaints.",4,2015,01,04
115,New Year's Eve treat - close to Tottenham station.,"Absolutely wonderful stay, excellent staff and service. Greeted with mulled wine and hot talls. A couple of minor things to mention, but still very much loved our experience as a whole: Very happy to have opening windows, but we had to listen to a noisy vent. Squeaky pipes meant I was awoken by other people's showers - on new years day. The carpet outside our bathroom was wet on arrival, which we ignored, but then realised an issue with the shower was causing minor flooding. An engineer was sent within 1 minute and fixed the problem. Our 'takeaway breakfast' was not ready at the time but they delivered it to our room within minutes, but it was slightly wrong, but not a problem. The room was beautiful and included everything you may need, but we felt it was over cluttered for the size.",5,2015,01,03
115,A new year stay,"Overall we were satisfied of our stay in this hotel.

However we find that ****+ is overrated for this hotel.

We asked for room not close to the elevators.
However, the room was just next to it and inside the room was the laundry shaft (room 628) used by the cleaning personnel as of 6.30am! We could clearly hear opening and closing of this metallic door which woke us up every morning. We didn't report the problem assuming that the hotel was fully booked anyway in this end of year period.

Next to that the bathtub didn't look very fresh (brown and black dot). After inspection, it appears that is was coming from the used of an old non-skid and the black spot from an extensive usage (missing enamel)?",3,2015,01,02
115,Just perfect,"Bloomsbury hotel was a very good one. The location, just a short walk from Tottenham station, quiet street, 2 minutes walk to British Museum and/or Oxford Str was absolutely perfect. 
Rooms were ok, not big, but not small either, typical size of hotel room, clean and decorated nicely. We did not have any view, only to inner court. 

Breakfast I truly recommend. A lot of choices and good service. 

I was positively surprised as in England you never know what you'll get.
And I'm quite demanding on quality :) ",4,2015,01,02
115,Fantastic hotel and service,Stayed here for a shopping/ theatre weekend before xmas . Fantastic location and everything we wanted within walking distance . Excellent food and best breakfast ever . Defiantly looking to stay in this hotel next time in London.the staff and service provided make this hotel.,5,2014,12,31
115,A Great Location And Pleasant London Experience,"Surprising to read of of the reviews.  After a 4 night stay, with family, its hard to believe anyone could be disappointed to levels suggested in some reviews.

Nonetheless, The Bloomsbury is very well located just down from the British Museum, very near Tottenham Court Rd station, easy access to a number of bus lines and short walks to Oxford St, Leicester Square, Covent Gardens and Soho (within 15-20 mins).  There are also plenty of restaurants very near to the hotel for dining out.  Perfect would be an overstatement, but one could certainly do much worse for location.

Reception/concierge staff were very helpful on a number of occasions with suggestions and advice on places to go, when to go and more importantly when not to go.  They helped us organise an number of activities and arranged transport and nothing seemed to be a problem.

Rooms were as expected for such a hotel in London. Not the biggest of course but certainly well appointed and very comfortable for the price and big enough to have fit foldaway bed in for our son. Again surprised at some reviews, maybe we had a renovated room, but everything was modern, very clean and infinitely better than many I've stayed in the same price range.  In room wi fi worked well.  The room did suffer a little from normal London water pressure issues where the shower was not quite as strong as we would have preferred but certainly not a problem.

The lounge area, bar and restaurants all felt inviting and the staff in each were attentive and pleasant.  Particularly the staff in the bar area of the Lansdeer, we give them 10+ for service and making our stay welcoming.

Room service was also very quick and attended to all our requests quickly and without fuss.

All in all a very pleasant experience and would happily (and will most likely) stay at The Bloomsbury on our next visit.",5,2014,12,31
115,Great stay!,"Lovely hotel for our 2 night stay in London. Loved the Christmas decor! Made you feel warm and welcomed as you entered the lobby. Staff was very friendly. Rooms were clean and the shower pressure was great. Very nice hotel fitness facility (treadmills, elliptical, and a few free weights). If you are in London for the tourist sights though this hotel may not be your first choice. It's a bit out of the way of the popular tourist destinations. Otherwise a great hotel for the price! ",4,2014,12,30
115,"Good Hotel, Great Location, Brilliant Food","By accident I had to stay overnight and would probably normally eat modestly or perhaps room service. however tried the Landseer Restaurant for dinner, and found it to be brilliant (steak and ale pie) , not just for dinner, but possibly one of the best breakfasts in London in the morning!
Location good, and as I quite often take people for lunch in this area, will definitely be using this place again - shame you would not know there was a really decent restaurant from the outside
David A",4,2014,12,29
115,Horrible service,"I checked in to the hotel yesterday. We read the reviews and were impressed. Booked a superior room. The room is much smaller than the description.. Suffocatingly small. When I went down to the reception to ask for a change in room, they kept us waiting for 45 mins, saying they will be just 5 to 10 mins. On top of that, the manager Leo was very rude and disrespectful. We finally changed our room for more money of course, but the whole process was unpleasant. I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody purely because of the service. The location is good, the rooms are manageable, but there is no point of staying in a place you feel unwelcome! ",1,2014,12,29
115,Excellent Location,"The hotel is literally a two minute walk from Oxford Street and we were able to walk to Leicester Square, Covent Garden, Hyde  Park and Carnaby Street easily. This saved us the expense of having to buy an extortionately priced tube ticket! 

The hotel itself is very nice, but nothing extra special. We arrived at approx 8 pm and check-in was quick and efficient. Our room was on the 7th floor and perfectly fine, if a little small. The bed was very large and extremely comfortable. The only minor problem we had, was the shower and bath tap water never got above luke-warm. The room was cleaned each day and a turn down service was offered, however we could not take advantage of the service as we were using the room to get ready to visit the theatre. 

Breakfast is served in the hotel restaurant, located in the basement of the hotel. The restaurant staff are very friendly. A selection of pastries, meats, cheeses and cereals are available from the buffet and cooked breakfast items are ordered. We tried the full English breakfast, pancakes with bacon and maple syrup and gammon and eggs during our stay, all of which were perfectly nice. 

We visited the hotel bar one evening, which is also located in the basement of the hotel. The cocktail menu was very old fashioned, in my opinion.

Check out was quick and efficient, even though the reception was busy, with several other guests checking out at the same time. An older couple checking out at the same time as us was complaining about the quality of their room to the receptionist. 

Overall we were satisfied with the hotel, for the price we paid. The hotel is in an excellent location and we would stay again for the same price. The hotel is just lacking a wow factor!",4,2014,12,28
115,great hotel with a cracking restaurant,we went to the bloomsbury hotel for our friends and family christmas dinner on the 20th december and was greeted with an all round tip top experience. from the service and great cocktails in the bar from the expert barman Joel and then into the restaurant where we had the pre theatre menu and the selections on there were amazing. i personally had the venison for starter and then the pie and mash for main which has soon much taste. then for afters was the chocolate tower which was a taste sensation. the hotel is a great location for the west end with plush and lush surroundings and decor and then you have high speed wi fi for free with the great bar and restaurant to relax in. highly recommended,5,2014,12,27
115,Good but small!,"In Summary

1. Great location
2. Small rooms 
3. Tiny bathroom - which is prone to flooding
4. Strangely confusing check out system
5. Strange idea of setting out food menus for you to order food, only to then be told that tat food  is not available.

If you get a deal, go for it - wouldn't pay full price.",3,2014,12,26
115,"Excellent location, nice and clean hotel","We will certainly come back to this hotel. as the location is great, you are within walking distance to restaurants, nightlife and stores. The British museum is just around the corner. The room was on the small side considering we had an upgrade but clean and nice. The beds were good and the shower fine (I don't know why hotel showers are always contructed in a way that you flood the whole bathroom when you take a shower but I amused to it by now...). I enjoyed the Nespresso machine in the room - lovely idea. We had breakfast once and it was very good with a nice choice at the buffet addionaly to the warm menu items. Nothing to complain about. Service was also friendly and helpful during the whole stay.",4,2014,12,26
115,Charming hotel in central location,"This property is a renovated YWCA, but for American tourists:  this does not equate with shabby, dorm like style!  The hotel itself is charming in decor, the staff is cordial and helpful, and the food is very good.  Only 2 blocks from the British Museum and a few more from West Side shows, world class shopping and fine restaurants,the location is central.",5,2014,12,23
115,Five star all round,"Well placed for all London has to offer. Great food even though they cater fir masses, spotless inside each room and toilets scrupulously cleaned too. Service was super efficient
Would recommend to all. ",5,2014,12,21
115,a weekend away,"we had two nights here recently and loved it. It is so convenient for the theatres and yards away from Tottenham Court road tube station. We were welcomed with mulled wine . We ate in the restaurant the first night and had a very acceptable meal. Breakfast the following morning was a bit chaotic as everyone seemed to arrive at once and the staff seemed a bit overwhelmed . Not a problem though the next day
Lovely room and bathroom. Very comfy bed . A bit hot on both nights despite it being very cold outside so good job there was air conditioning. I loved it and hope to stay again",5,2014,12,19
115,Lovely hotel,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is my favourite hotel in London.  The warm and gracious atmosphere is very welcoming after a tiring trip or long day at work.  Some of the rooms are quite small, so if it's space you're looking for, you may need to reconsider.  Otherwise, it's always very clean, the beds are comfortable, the bathrooms are well-appointed and it's quiet and comfortable.  The staff is lovely, and you get a warm damp cloth to clean your hands at reception (bliss) and a bottle of water to take with you when you check out.",5,2014,12,19
115,Average Experience,"Attended a three day conference at the Hotel. Requested an early check-in at 10:30 as I was travelling overnight. Arrived at the Hotel at 10:15 and was told the room was not ready. Offered a complimentary coffee. Enquired at 12:00 and at 13:00 and the room was still not ready. Eventually received a room at 13:30 from the reception manager and was informed that I was lucky to receive an earlier check-in. Wow!

Was allocated a room on the 6th floor. Probably the smallest room I have stayed in ever in a Hotel but it was nicely decorated. Mattress a bit warn with valleys. Dry walls and could hear my neighbours. Was woken up at 01:00 by the fire alarm. When I called reception I was informed that it was an accident. They probably rang the bell because of my snoring! 

Had dinner twice in the Hotel. The seafood special was nice and well cooked and prepared but the portions were very small. The next night I ordered the fish and chips on the recommendation of the waitress. To my surprise the food arrived within two/three minutes of placing the order. When I queried the speed of the service I was informed that they prepare six to eight pieces of fish at a time. Mine was clearly microwaved and awful. The portion was very small. I suggest the chef takes a stroll down the street to a local fish and chips take away to see and taste what a fish and chips should look like. (Directions - turn right when you leave the hotel walk down the street for a block and a half and turn right again. Halfway down the block is a small fisheries ran by an elderly Greek guy). Excellent fish and chips at a third of the price.

The one thing that is outstanding at this Hotel is the friendliness of the staff. It is exceptional and they go out of their way to make you feel welcome.

Continental breakfast limited but everything fresh and well prepared. The food served at the conference meals were excellent and perhaps better that the food in the restaurant.

The Hotel is centrally located and close to all the major areas in London.",3,2014,12,19
115,Beautiful hotel - great location,"My partner and I stayed for one night last week and it was perfect.... A beautiful and immaculate  building, very friendly and  helpful reception staff and concierge.  Our room was a double deluxe as I specifically wanted a bathroom with a bathtub rather than just a shower - the decor was lovely and altho the bathtub was a bit small it was more than adequate.  We only had a snack in the restaurant but the food was good and the service was great.  The location is ideal as it's only a few mins walk into the West End.  There's a car park just a minute's walk away and I now hear  it's cheaper to pre-book which we will do next time.  I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,12,19

115,Wonderful Hotel,We have just got back from a two night stay at The Bloomsbury. The hotel was absolutely lovely and is in a perfect location. The staff were all very helpful and polite. The rooms are very nicely decorated and have the comfiest beds! The hotel very kindly gave me a birthday card and cake which was left in our room! Thank you for a wonderful stay we will definitely be returning. ,5,2014,12,18
115,Best afternoon tea,"We just stopped in for afternoon tea and had a lovely time. Great service, beautiful food (homemade scones ,  nice mixture of cakes and fresh sandwiches) and lovely atmosphere. Reasonable price as got a deal. Definitely worth a visit. ",5,2014,12,18
115,Perfection,"Our family stayed at the Bloomsbury for combined birthday and anniversary celebrations in late November.  From the second we arrived and smelled the heavenly candles in the lobby, I knew we had made the right selection.  The concierge was always quick with a suggestion, walking distance to the West End, close to public transportation but on a quiet street, perfectly appointed rooms with comfortable beds, champagne and dessert for the celebrations, and the list goes on.  This is where we will always stay in London.",5,2014,12,18
115,Fabulous,I can't fault this hotel. I stayed here after our Christmas party and was very impressed. The lobby is beautiful ... Scented candles are a lovely touch. We ended our evening in the bar .. Excellent service. My room was lovely .. Very comfortable bed .. Great bathroom .. Good products. I would highly recommend ,5,2014,12,18
115,"Great location, beautifully maintained hotel",We managed an excellent price through Trip Advisor.  Location and staff were excellent as well.  Easy access to the underground and walking around from there was pretty simple as well. A definite recommendation...will return another day.,4,2014,12,18
115,Great Location and good hotel,"My wife and I chose this hotel based on all the TA reviews. We were not disappointed.
The best feature of this hotel is a toss up - the staff ( read Concierge) or the location. Either way, for tourists in downtown London, this cannot be beat. We were 2 blocks from the British Museum, one block from the bus stop (buses go everywhere in London) and 3 blocks from the subway. Plus Brian the Concierge gave us awesome restaurant and tour info. Stay here and be happy.",4,2014,12,17
115,Fabulous hotel,"Arrived on Friday lunchtime into the beautiful lobby with high ceilings tall Christmas tree and fragrant candles check in was swift. Our room was large well furnished with expensive furnishings bathroom was a large marbled room with deep bath and large separate shower.facilities in the room were good And a plus was a nespresso  coffee machine with pods and choice of teas if preferred. After a shopping trip into Oxford Street which was only a short walk away we returned to the hotel and had a cocktail in the bar, what a treat the bar was cosy, comfortable, but very smart with great music at the right level. Next morning we went down for breakfast,we got a warm welcome before we were seated, staff were very attentive and charming the choice at breakfast was very comprehensive so much choice..we stayed for two nights and we would certainly stay at the Bloomsbury again. Very high standard of service and great central location for shopping shows and sight seeing.",5,2014,12,15
115,BLOOMING LOVELY,"Stayed here 12th - 14th December in a superior room which was very comfortable and quiet on the 6th floor.The room had tea/coffee facilities including a nespresso coffee machine,complimentary biscuits and water.Bathrobes and slippers was supplied.The hotel smelt lovely as you walked in and all the staff was very pleasant and very helpful.The breakfast in the Landseer suite was lovely with plenty to choose from,we had the full english which was served  very hot by the lovely waitresses.We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again as it is so close to oxford street and the many attractions.Check in and check out was very efficient ,we again received complimentary bottles of water to leave with.Thank you for the upgrade it made our weekend special.",5,2014,12,15
115,Great location and lovely hotel,"Warmly welcomed by friendly staff. Impressed with the architecture and ambience of this hotel. Well appointed, though not palatial room. Comfortable bed and very quiet room ensured a good nights sleep.
Well cooked and extensive breakfast. You would have to be very picky to find fault with this hotel.",5,2014,12,15
115,Bloomsbury Fine,"This hotel was first chosen for it's location, a ten minute walk to Covent Garden, the same to theatre land and round the corner to Oxford Street with plenty of restaurants in the vicinity.
On our recent stay, we were fortunate to be in a studio suite and have to say, the room was excellent. Having stayed at this hotel before, we knew what to expect and we were not disappointed, friendly and helpful staff, excellent room facilities, good food in the restaurant and great service all round. 
There's a feeling of calm as soon as you enter the foyer, leaving the chaos of the city outside. Wonderful! The Bloomsbury is becoming our go to hotel in London and we will definitely return. Highly recommended!",5,2014,12,15
115,Blooming Marvelous!!,"Directly across from the famous art suppliers, a few steps away from the iconic British Museum, and a short walk to all the hustle and bustle of Regents Street.  This is a grand hotel in both scale and service. Rooms are comfortable and beds amazingly comfortable. A much better choice than any other hotel in the area because of the well appointed spacious rooms, attentive and friendly staff and proximity to local attractions.",5,2014,12,15
115,Gorgeous hotel at heart of London!,"We had 4 nights there. First the bell boy was efficient and helpful with our luggages, the receptionist is pretty, humorous  and very helpful . Road side parking is £5.50 per hour. Did not see other parking. The lobby is impressive , elegant yet cozy . 
Nicely decorated . 
The room is so arty, beautifully furnished. Bed from Sealy, pillow is comfortable. Nice tea and tea facilities , toilet is clean , with very nice shower essentials. Room service is great, hotel is safe. Very near British museum , shopping n Broadway theatre and restaurants. Love this hotel!",5,2014,12,15
115,Great central location,"Super location, refined hotel with good service and helpful staff. Many retail outlets within minutes walk of the hotel. Very comfortable well appointed rooms. Beautiful Luytens designed building with atmospheric bar and restaurant.",5,2014,12,15
115,"beautiful lobby , mediocre room , great restaurant Landseer","We visited the Bloomsbury Summer 2014 for our 15th anniversary . It is a beautiful hotel , classic lobby with marble and nice furnishings and a high ceiling , an old world feeling . We were surprised to enter our room and see furnishings from Ikea or worse . The room was cold and sparse and cheap looking , and also LOUD because the laundry chute jutted into our room and ran down the wall , and had a very loud metal door in the hall that we heard every time the staff opened and slammed it shut to deposit sheets , etc . The hotel staff customer service was ok , but the service at the restaurant , the Landseer , was exceptional , especially Maria and Estelita and Andre , they made the hotel a better place , and the breakfasts were wonderful . The hotel's location was nice , near the British Museum , and a short ride to all the other attractions .",3,2014,12,14
115,Great stay,"Stayed here for one night for my birthday. We were greeted bra lovely, pleasant young lady called Joelle who checked us in and offered a warming mulled cider, unfortunately our room wasn't, as we did arrive early and this was no problem we left our luggage with the concierge. After spending a great afternoon in London we came back to our room, we booked a superior room and were not disappointed. The room was very clean and spacious, with lots of added luxuries like bathrobes, slippers, nespresso machine and free bottled water.The bed was comfortable and once all the windows were closed, very quiet. My only criticisms are that firstly the lighting was awful, very poor, very difficult to apply make up in the evening when getting ready for our night out as the the bathroom lighting was very dulll. Also there was a lack of plug sockets, so no where to plug in the hair dryer, which was provided and the iron which was also provided in the room. Overall a lovely hotel, great location, close to shop, theatres etc and friendly staff, wouldn't hesitate to recommend or stay here again.",4,2014,12,14
115,"Classy, delightful and comfortable hotel","We stay usually for a night in London each year as a gift to each other - this is the nicest and most comfortable hotel I've stayed in London. I'd be happy to never stay elsewhere. 
Rooms are very comfortable, lit nicely with good temp control and in room facilities. 
Great bar, lovely relaxed vibe. We had pre dinner cocktails here and they were spot on. 
Delicious breakfast with lots of choice of quality items both hot and cold.

Exceptionally professional courteous staff and the hotel building is spotless, and smells fabulous too!
We loved so much we wanted to instantly for new year but they're sold out. Not surprised. Lucky people.:-)",5,2014,12,14
115,"First visit, very good impression ","Our first visit to the Bloomsbury and we we were given a nice surprise of an upgrade to a Junior Suite. Spacious, large clean room with a nice seating area and bathroom with walk in shower and separate bath. We spent our afternoon in the Landseer Bar/Restaurant having cocktails with friends followed by a very tasty meal. Superb position for going to see White Christmas at The Dominion Theatre just round the corner. ",5,2014,12,14
115,Never let you down,"When we come from the US to London we always stay at this hotel. We had another nice stay. A couple of small snaffus but the wonderful thing about this hotel is they go out of their way to put anything right. Wonderful service. The champagne in the room for our daughter's 21st was a liovely touch, along with a hand written note to accompany it. A rarity nowadays. Our only annoyance of any significance was a fire alarm in the middle of the night. A blip in the scheme of things. Highly recommended.
              ",5,2014,12,11
115,"""LUXURY WITH GREAT SERVICE""","Fantastic location for visiting London business or private.Everything was above standed, the rooms were comfortable, the location was very close to shopping complex and bond street,the very best part was staff and service we received fabulous, very quick check in check out , special thanks to Adriana. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,12,10
115,Small room that had a bad smell,"Unfortunately I was very disappointed by the room I was allocated and the distinct bad smell in there . I did bring this to the attention of the receptionist but unfortunately the issue was not resolved . 
In a positive note the breakfast area was clean and tidy and the breakfast was hot and plentiful . ",3,2014,12,10
115,A hotel gem by Sir Edwin Lutyens,"Little known, but centrally located for the British Museum and Oxford Street, this elegant hotel has been transformed from a London Club and is inmate and welcoming.
Beautifully proportioned with most of the original interior including a library and chapel intact, the Bloomsbury is a delight.",4,2014,12,10
115,Luxury in the heart of London,"This is the second time I've stayed at this this hotel, but the first time since its new ownership. The hotel was always good, as it has a perfect location close to Covent Garden and the British Museum; but now it is even better. The lobby is very luxurious, and we were offered complimentary mulled wine as we arrived. The art work in the corridors is top class, and the rooms were good. The breakfast was really excellent, with a great range of option for vegetarians, including a veggie cooked breakfast. Overall this is an excellent place to stay in London.",5,2014,12,10
115,Needs a little tidy up for a 5 star review,"The hotel provides a brilliant welcome with a wet towel and a bottle of water (nice touch). The overall decor is top notch, classy and ozzes quality, yet it's not old and stuffy. Staff are very polite and professional with great facilities all around. 
The only let down is the size of the room (I stayed in a Superior room but that just means standard in London:)) and the scruffy bathrooms. Patches of moldy silicone around the shower and flaking paint around doorways. Easily repaired to improve the overall impression of your room. But overall, definitely worthy of 4 star",4,2014,12,09
115,A gem and haven in London,"A great location, clean comfortable and stylish.   However, the best asset this hotel possesses is its staff. Each member of staff we encountered during our stay was friendly, approachable, polite and helpful.  The rooms are well appointed and comfortable and the breakfast excellent.  Will have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to all and booking a return visit. Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2014,12,09
115,Fantastic Stay,"We stayed for one night when visiting for a friend's graduation. The staff at reception were very friendly and luckily we were able to check in at 11am. The room itself was very clean and well furnished; the large bed was very comfortable and had good quality linen. The shower was excellent as were the toileteries; we had forgotten toothpaste and this was rectified by housekeeping with a complementary dental kit within a couple of minutes! The highlight of the hotel was the fabulous cooked English breakfast with excellent service by the restaurant staff - it rates one of the best we have ever had (and we have had many); the only gripe one could have was the underdone toast! Finally, at checkout we were given complimentary bottled spring water for our train journey back home. We have no hesitation in recommending the Bloomsbury Hotel and will stay again. ",5,2014,12,09
115,nice,"it was a nice boutique hotel. not a bad location. room was quite small but nicely decorated. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. All in all i would recommend this hotel. The only downfall was the location, a little bit out from the center.",4,2014,12,09
115,Brilliant and amazing value,"Brought a group of 25 for meal. Pre ordered meal, excellent service and food delicious. Confusion on paying for water but soon sorted with apology. Lovely staff and would like to stay. Thank you to Marta especially, lovely lady ",5,2014,12,08
115,"Quiet, cozy and convenient","I stayed at the Bloomsbury on a business trip for 5 nights in November.   My stay was exceptionally comfortable from start to finish.  The hotel is conveniently located in a safe, pedestrian friendly area and there was always at least one doorman in attendance which added to the sense of security.

I wanted a quiet room and got one on the 6th floor with a window to the interior.  The carpeting in the room and hallway was plush and the hotel door was thick which blocked out the noise from other guests.  The window had double panes.  This was by far the quietest room I've had in my visits to London.

The bedroom was small by American standards but a perfect fit for one person.   The desk conveniently had an outlet with American current so I didn't need to use a currency adapter.   The closet held 2 robes, 2 pairs of slippers an iron and ironing board. I could have used a few more hangers, but didn't get around to asking for them.   Other than being quiet, the thing I appreciated most about the room was the excellent lighting.  There were reading lights for both sides of the bed, a closet light, two separate lighting switches for the bathroom and two other ways to adjust the room lights.  Figuring out all the light switches was a challenge when I arrived jet-lagged and at one point I just put a towel over one of the lights I couldn't figure out how to turn off and just went to sleep.   The same jet lagged response goes for adjusting the thermostat.  There were directions, but it was a bit too much to deal with until I got a night's sleep.   What I liked about the bed is that it had four pillows and a soft but not overly heavy comforter.   Each night the room was tidied up and a couple of delicious chocolates left at the side of the bed. 

The room came with a single-serve coffee maker and three servings of coffee (2 regular and 1 decaf) and instructions.  There was also a tea pot, though I didn't try it out.   The room had a mini-bar but there were so many restaurants and convenience stores in easy walking distance that I didn't use it.

The bathroom was large given the size of the room and incredibly clean and polished-- not one stray hair, spec of dust or water spot on anything.   The towels were thick and absorbent.  The tub was extra long by American standards.   The shower head was high and what I liked best was that the warm shower water came quickly and the water pressure for taking a shower was more than adequate and held steady.   The bathroom came with a quality shampoo and conditioner, a shower cap and lotion, though the lotion didn't absorb into my skin as fast as I would have liked.  Another jet-lagged/American item, I couldn't figure out how to drain the bathroom sink and ended up just leaving it full my first morning.  To drain the sink, press down on the drain.

The cold buffet continental breakfast was quite good, with selections of cheese, cereal, yogurt, juices, cheeses and meats.   My co-workers and I ordered 3-5 cups of coffee apiece each morning which efficiently came by the waitstaff after we asked for each refill.   There was also a nice selection of newspapers to read.

The staff was professional and polite.  When I was about in the hotel and needed something, such as directions to breakfast, I found that if I just stood in place for a few moments someone from the staff would come by and ask me what I needed.

The Bloomsbury exceeded my expectations.  I highly recommended it.",5,2014,12,07
115,Fantastic!!!,"We have stayed in many hotels in London and this is definitely one of the very best. Some places you know as soon as you walk in that it's going to be good and this is certainly one of them. The staff are excellent, breakfast was delicious, the rooms have everything you could want from a hotel room. BUT READ THIS - I left my emerald ring in a wine glass on the desk and wasn't aware I had until I got home, immediately rung hotel fearing the worst... The maid had handed it in!! How fantastic is that, big thanks to the hotel and staff. Need I say any more how good hotel is. Just book it.",5,2014,12,06
115,Lovely Stay at the Bloomsbury,"We stayed at The Bloomsbury for 3 nights in November, we were not keen on the first room offered, but this was quickly dealt with by friendly efficient staff, who sorted a room overlooking the street for us which was lovely with a King size bed & nice bathroom. The breakfast was excellent with everything you would want, hot or cold, again with great friendly service from the staff. When we came back one evening, there was a piece of gorgeous cake, with an anniversary card from The Hotel....How lovely was that!.....All in all, a great luxury Hotel with excellent staff in a great location(3 mins from Tottenham Court Road Underground)",5,2014,12,06
115,Wonderful stay!,"If you want a 5*hotel in London with a personal touch then this is the place to stay. From the reservation process to the check out this is by far and away the most wonderful hotel in London and I would say the nicest hotel I have stayed in for a long time! Amazing decor, fantastic staff, warm, comfortable and very cosseting. The bed was so comfy with crisp, egyptian cotton sheets. Elegant without being too stuffy this is the perfect hotel! Bags are whisked away, check in is fast and efficient but hugely welcoming, rooms are super clean, luxurious and very comfy, the hotel smells wonderful, the bar is exactly as a hotel bar  should be, staff were lovely and the cocktails were so good! The guest relations staff were so helpful (thank you Louise and Malaka) you truly made our stay from organising a super room (huge comfy bed!) to having a cocktail mixed and named after my partner with printed menus of the cocktail scattered around the bar as a birthday surprise. Also many thanks for the card and the cake that was placed in our room from the staff. I cant wait to come back and stay with you again, hopefully very soon! ",5,2014,12,05
115,amazing service,"One of the best (if not the best) hotels I have stayed in . The staff could not have been more helpful , the room was immaculate and the breakfast on Sunday a true feast for the eyes and stomach. We where made to feel so welcome and it is a few steps from the Dominion theatre (White Christmas was fantastic) and a ten minute saunter from Covent Garden . You can walk all the way up Oxford Street from here with lot of shopping .View from the room not wonderful but who cares when its dark so long as it is quiet . I will certainly be going back .",5,2014,12,03
115,Top Notch,"Excellent hotel with great amenities and excellent location (especially if you plan to head to the theaters).  Spent three nights as part of a vacation celebrating our parent's 40th wedding anniversary.  Of the several hotels we stayed in during the vacation, this one topped their list.  Staff was extremely helpful with transportation assistance and restaurant recommendations/reservations.  And our family always enjoys the chocolates that come with turn down service at night!  And if anyone can tell us what scent the candles are that they use in the lobby, we want to buy some!!!",5,2014,12,02
115,Comfort and Location!,"We could not have asked for more during our visit to London! The central location is wonderful and we were able to walk to just about everything we wanted to see. From the moment we arrived and were greeted with some fresh iced tea, through show and restaurant recommendations from the concierge, all the way until check-out when we were given assistance with the best way to get to the London St. Pancras train station, The Bloomsbury Hotel made our few days in London a wonderful experience. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the customer service was excellent and friendly. Would definitely recommend this hotel and we will stay there again when we return to London!",5,2014,12,01
115,"Top quality, round the corner from Oxford Street, very nice hotel","Easy to book, easy to check in, helpful staff, very clean and well presented. Staff were efficient, hotel room was very clean and well equipped with everything we needed. Beds get turned down with bedside chocolates, room price included all mod cons and towels, price did not include breakfast.  Had a drink in the bar and room service, all very efficient, toilets near the bar area were not up to par in my opinion, one of the reasons this didn't get 5 stars, easy check out. Would stay again.",4,2014,11,30
115,Great location with warm welcome,"Just spent 3 nights at The Bloomsbury. Very enjoyable with genuinely welcoming staff. Allowed to sleep in in the mornings without being disturbed. We stayed in front of hotel on fourth floor which was very quiet. Comfortable accommodation with nice touches such as turn down service at night. Great location only a few minutes from Tottenham Court underground station. Choice of restaurants, cafes within a few minutes walk. Walking distance to theatres, Covent Garden, Leicester Square, Oxford Street. We visited as part of my birthday celebration s and we were pleasantly surprised with room service bringing me a birthday cake and card on behalf of the hotel. It felt that all staff really wanted to make our stay enjoyable and even after checking out the Concierge looked after our luggage until it was time for us to catch our train home. Would definitely stay here again if visiting London.",5,2014,11,28
115,Great London Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel last weekend and I can only add to the positive reviews on tripadvisor . The hotel is less than 5 minutes walk from Tottenham Court Road tube station and upon arrival we were warmly greeted and quickly checked in to our comfortable room - usual amenities (all working) including nespresso machine which is a nice touch. The hotel was quiet at night with no outside traffic heard in our 7th floor room.We ate in the Landseer restaurant one night and had the pre theatre meal which was great value.The service in the restaurant and bar was excellent . The bar is pricey but then you expect that in London.Breakfast was great and although busy,the service was excellent.I can recommend this hotel and I will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,11,27
115,"Diamond Earrings Recovered, Superlative Service","I am a worldwide traveler.  I've stayed at luxury hotels all over the globe.  This is my 6th or 7th trip to London.  There are many standout hotels with superlative service.  My fiancé and I were marveling at the extremely high quality here at the Bloomsbury Hotel with its beautifully appointed rooms, the most responsive and attentive staff...little things like leaving a loving couple alone in the mornings, even long mornings, without pressure to vacate the room for daily cleaning.  And yet the room was always superlatively cleaned no matter how late we left for the days' activities.  The location could not be better...across from the British Museum, in the heart of Covent Garden and the Theatre District, an easy walk to everywhere.  We were already raving, intent on writing the best of reviews.  Then today happened... My fiancé had set a pair of expensive diamond earrings on the bed and got distracted.  We left the room without her putting on the earrings.  When we arrived back, the room was perfectly appointed, beautifully cleaned, the bed made.  And there, conspicuously on the bed, carefully placed in view, were the $10,000 earrings.  Service just does not get better than that.  We will be back.",5,2014,11,27
115,Great hotel in fantastic location,"A great hotel less than 200 metres from Tottenham Court Road tube station.

Excellent breakfast and large, well furnished rooms with lovely touches such as chocolates on pillow and a nespresso machine. 

Will return when in London.",5,2014,11,25
115,Pleasant but not worth the price,"It is clean, pleasant, elegant and tastefully decorated. Staff try hard to accommodate and are polite and attentive. That said, sound proofing is not a forte at this hotel. 
But for the price... it feels a bit like the hotel is trying to be something it isn't. A bit posher, a bit swankier, a bit better than it is. Everything very decent and pleasant. But I'd rather a bit less theatre and a cheaper rate. 
In the end however, it depends what you're after.",4,2014,11,24
115,Excellent,This is an excellent hotel in the theatre district and near British museum . The rooms are nice and the staff excellent. We travel to London for pleasure yearly. This hotel.  Is located near a tube station and walking distance to food and the theatre. ,5,2014,11,24
115,First Class,"Great hotel in a great location. From the minute we got out of the taxi until the minute we left the staff were excellent.  Breakfast was great and the evening meal we had one evening just hit the spot.  A special mention for the barman, who's name unfortunately I did not get, who really knows how to make people feel welcome.",5,2014,11,24
115,Our favourite London hotel so far ...,"A warm welcome and efficient check in.  All staff we met throughout our stay were friendly, helpful and curteous. Room was warm and comfortable with a very efficient coffee machine and a lovely bathroom.  Perfectly situated for our weekend within walking distance of theatre and Oxford Street.  Breakfast was lovely with plenty of choice and quick service.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,11,23
115,Excellent location,"The hotel is very well placed for Oxford Street, Leicester Square, Covent Garden etc. The hotel is beautiful inside and the room was fantastic for the price - very comfy bed and pillows. The bar man made us feel very welcome and made us a few excellent cocktails. The only thing that let down the weekend stay was the service at breakfast.",4,2014,11,23
115,Excellent hotel very close to British Museum,"Excellent hotel with very comfortable rooms on a very convenient location, very close to the British museum. Excellent on-site dining in Landseer restaurant.
The buffet breakfasts were also a real treat.
              ",5,2014,11,23
115,Faultless from start to finish,"We had the pleasure of staying in the bloomsbury hotel for a weekend break to London. Fabulous central location. A short walk away from theatres, shopping and Tottenham court road tube station. Upon check in we were greeted by friendly, efficient staff who also treated us the luxury of a hot towel. ( it's the little things that count).  The room itself was fantastic. The decor was very modern and the bedroom and bathroom were very spacious.  I felt thoroughly spoiled by all the little luxuries that were present. Eg, the robe, slippers and toiletries.  The beds were extremely comfortable, which allowed for 2 very pleasant nights sleep!  Another added bonus and a particularly nice touch was the nespresso machine.  No need to call room service for a decent morning coffee, it was right there for us in the room. Breakfast was exceptional and plentiful. The menu had a great selection of hot and cold food, everything I ordered was cooked to perfection.  Overall,  terrific hotel with friendly, engaging and professional staff. I will be returning and would have no hesitation recommending the Bloomsbury to friends and family.",5,2014,11,22
115,All round excellence,"I had the pleasure of staying here for a business trip when my pre-booked hotel inadvertently cancelled my booking, I'm pleased they did. This is a beautiful hotel, when you arrive the first thing you notice is the lovely smell in the lobby. The staff are excellent, polite and respectful but also very friendly. I ate in the restaurant for dinner and although on my own I thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience due to the fantastic food and the great staff. The only negative was that the bedroom was slightly small, but unless you plan to spend all day there it shouldn't matter because they're just about adequate and very tastefully decorated. I will be going back.",5,2014,11,21
115,Excellent comfortable hotel,"This is out of my normal price range, but London is expensive and I wanted somewhere central so I said what the hell... The location is close to the British museum the underground and very easy walking distance to many of the sites we wanted to visit. The room, a Queen room, was really excellent and the facilities were allbexcellent. I think the Kingsley at Holborn nearby was better value - it lacked the class and the finish of the Bloomsbury but was still very good and less expensive.",5,2014,11,20
115,Amazing Room in a Great Neighborhood!,"I've stayed in London several times and have to say that the average hotel rooms there leave a lot to be desired.  When I booked the Bloomsbury, I was hoping to at least have a bathroom I could turn around in without tripping over something! 

Lo and behold, when I checked into my room, I was pleasantly surprised with the largest hotel room I've ever had in London!  Beyond the room itself being large, the bed was amazing as well.  The last time I stayed in London, the lasting memory (besides the small room) was the horrible quality of my bed.  The Bloomsbury more than made up for it!  

Stepping away from the room, however, the entire experience at the hotel was exceptional!  From front desk check-in to overall hotel appearance, I was impressed enough to ensure that I put this on my next place to stay when returning to London!",5,2014,11,20
115,Great Hotel,"The rooms are clean and spacious compared to most central London hotels. The location is very convenient. The sensory experience with the candles is amazing and I bought one. (Now wishing I had gotten more). Customer service is very good and the food outstanding. My small issue standing in the way of a five star is my morning breakfast experience. First day (this past Monday) I waited several minutes to be seated. No big deal if it was independent but upon being seated I was asked if I wanted coffee and showed the buffet. Ten minutes later no coffee and realized there were hot options available. Second day was a bit better but when I requested cream or milk for my coffee I got a thick yellowish substance which curdled in my coffee. Didn't even turn creamy just kind of hard grainy strings. It was quickly replaced. Wednesday Abby saved the day! So warm personable and friendly. Just started the day out right. So stay at the Bloomsbury. I highly recommend and hope to return soon. Enjoy the experience and if breakfast doesn't go quite right, look for Abby! lol!",4,2014,11,20
115,Brilliant and special,"We spent the first night of our european vacation here at the Bloomsbury Hotel.  They made our stay amazing.  First off, coming from an international 18 hour flight, we get to the hotel at 8am and are so happy to know that our room was ready and we were upgraded to a suite.  I was stunned as most hotels dont have rooms ready this early.. and the suite was HUGE and super cozy.  Because of this we were able to shower and explore the city (we only had that day before leaving for Dover the next day)comfortably.  Their concierge Paolo was super.  He was so helpful and patient in answering all my questions regarding sights and getting around.  He also tried his best to get us into a restaurant we wanted to go to.  I mentioned how much I love the candle scent burning in the hallway en route to the elevator  and asked where I could buy it-- the next thing I know he gets me one and its my most special souvenir from London.  The filipino bartender (i forget his name)  at the Landseer Bar was so kind as to chat with us and make us feel so at home and welcomed while we were having drinks before dinner.  The wine and beer selection was delicious as well.  The ladies at the restaurant for breakfast were also very warm and attentive to our requests.  The breakfast buffet (included in our room) was delicious.  The location is great as it is on a quiet street, near the Tottenham train stop.  Its walking distance to covent garden and oxford circus.   What's great is the warm welcome you get after a long day out and the personalized service in every aspect of your stay.  Finally the bed makes sure you have a well rested night.  We will be back when we visit London soon.",5,2014,11,19
115,Perfect!,"We stayed for one night, and everything was brilliant.  Couple of minutes from theatres and 5 or 6 minutes walk from Leicester Square. Check in was quick and easy. The hotel itself is so pretty with lots of art to look at through the hallways, and the rooms were brilliant. Nespresso machine, robes and slippers with comfy seating and a massive bed! Mattress was soft but very comfortable. The shower was fine - not a power shower but certainly hot and worked fine enough. Turn down service while we were out was a super touch! I would really recommend their ""take out"" breakfast - sandwiches and muffins for around £4 instead of the £27 for a full cooked breakfast in the restaurant - a good size portion and genuinely one of the nicest breakfasts we've had! Finally, the staff - friendly, courteous and so helpful. Can't wait to stay again!!",5,2014,11,17

Sorry we couldn't stay longer Must come again. We thank you also for being so close to everything.",5,2014,11,17
115,Fabulisous,I walked from Kings Cross. 25 Minutes at a steady pace. Right by the British Museum. Doorman was immediately friendly and polite as were the receptionists. Straight up to my. Room which was immaculate. I was there for business and I will use it again. Very happy stay and very comfortable. The door man was even more helpful when we running late for dinner. He went off and came back with a taxi. very impressive. I hope the Bloomsbury stays like this.,5,2014,11,17

The room was lovely and nicely decorated and a great comfy queen sized bed, the only down side to the room was it was sooo hot in there and the air was so temperamental it did make it hard to get a good nights sleep, and get ready on an evening,
The breakfast was nice cooked to order and filled us up for the day, 
The concierge was great to get tickets from and point us in the right direction, would defiantly stay here again xx  ",5,2014,11,16
115,"well appointed, good location, very small room",From the minute you walk in you are greeted warmly  by lovely staff. The décor is lovely and the hotel is in a good position. Room service is prompt. The room was well decorated with thoughtful accessories such as a nespresso machine as well as a kettle and tea and coffee making facilities. For these reasons I liked the hotel. However.......More capsules and instant coffee would have been welcome. We had a standard room as only passing through for one night but it was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in. It was difficult for two people to move around the room easily. If we had had cases as opposed to overnight bags there would have been nowhere to put them without blocking the floor.. The wardrobe has little hanging space for longer clothes it being full of bathrobe. Hanging a coat made the door difficult to close and as it has an internal light this was annoying. The rest of the hanging space was mot for longer clothes unless you removed the tea tray but there was little space to put that elsewhere. The bathroom was small but nice  and the toiletries were good. Overall ok for a one night stay but room rate expensive for size of room and would not be good value or comfortable for longer stay without paying for a larger room. The room was better suited to a single traveller. Bed was very comfortable.There was no view at all other than windows of other rooms.,4,2014,11,16
115,"Great hotel, amazing staff","We stayed at Bloomsbury for 4 nights last week. Having been there before, we knew what to expect: perfect location, great service, fantastic restaurant. But I would like to express my special  gratitude to the concierge and his team, who assisted my wife when she had medical emergency. Within minutes they arranged transport to nearest hospital and helped to bring her down from the room. She fully recovered now and is very thankful to the team.
My feeling is that Bloomsbury staff is prepared to go well beyond call of duty to make their guests comfortable and safe. Thank you!",5,2014,11,16
115,Great location. Nice rooms.,"This hotel is in Soho. Shopping and very good restaurants are within a 10-15 walking distance. Picadilly and Leicester Square are also within a nice short walk. It's set off a little from the very busy parts of Soho, so it was not very loud. The British Museum is very, very close.

The rooms are quite modern. Our queen bed room was bigger than the standard European hotel rooms. It was very much sized like an above-average sized US hotel room. The bathroom was good sized. Toiletries were very nice. And the wifi was more than adequate. 

We liked the turn down service in the evening.

I found the staff very helpful and accommodating. I had to split my bill between two credit cards. The staff handled it without problems.

I will definitely be staying at this hotel again.",5,2014,11,14
115,Elegant/Swellegant,"Nicest hotel I have stayed in. Picked because of its location near the theatre we were booked to see. Upgraded to a suite when the hotel did not receive message from travel agent that we needed twin beds (travelling with my sister).
Suite out of this world with marble bathroom and roll top bath.
Staff were helpful and pleasant. Whilst we waited for our afternoon train back home we read the Sunday papers in the foyer and were given complementary smoothies to drink. I would certainly use this hotel again. 
Elegant hotel with caring staff.",5,2014,11,13
115,Lovely romantic setting,"I booked a night at the Bloomsbury as a surprise for my girlfriend. We went to see show Wicked in the evening and then stayed in the Bloomsbury. I wanted somewhere special and romantic that we would remember! I was really impressed by the decor of the hotel, and also the staff were fantastically helpful. If anything, the room was a little on the small size, but it was very well presented and the bathroom especially was very roomy and modern. We loved the hotel, and for any couples out there looking for a special night in London, this hotel is perfect!",5,2014,11,13
115,Beautiful hotel,"I cannot rate this hotel highly enough. Me and partner stayed here for a two night weekend break at the beginning of November and wanted to stay somewhere slightly more luxurious and upmarket as it was a special occasion and this hotel more than exceeded our expectations. 

There are so many small touches in this hotel that really do make a difference such as being offered towels to freshen up on arrival, the heated mirror in the bathroom that doesn’t steam up (so I could easily do my makeup after my partner had a shower!). The lobby is warm and inviting with soft music and candles which smelled amazing when we came down each night. The little coffee machine in the room is also a nice touch. We’d mentioned when booking that it was our anniversary and a beautiful dessert  was brought up to our room – how delightful!

Our room was excellent - modern and contemporary, extremely clean and the bed was very comfortable. We put our “Service our Room” card out on the second day and we came back to a perfectly turned over room that looked like we had just arrived.

The staff are extremely professional and charming, from the doorman to the reception staff and the bar / restaurant staff. We ate in the hotel’s restaurant on the second night and the cocktails and food were both delicious. The breakfast is also extremely good quality with a wide selection of everything you could possibly want.  

I would be reluctant to stay anywhere else in London after staying here! They really know what they’re doing hence all the positive reviews and I hope to return on our next visit to London. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who values good quality and excellent customer service.",5,2014,11,13
115,Lovely place fantastic location.,"Just stayed at The Bloomsbury for 4 nights. Girlie shopping & theatre trip. Beautiful hotel spotlessly clean, very warm & welcoming staff. Excellent location for Oxford street & Covent Garden.
Have stayed before and will definatly be staying again.

115,Went the extra mile,"We stayed here primarily for the ocation and as part of  a birthday trewat for my husband. The hotel was great, the staff were genuinely welcoming and helpful. And as a nice extra touch when we returned to teh room they had left a card and a cake for my husbands birthday. I highly recommend The Bloomsbury :-)",5,2014,11,13
115,Bloomsbury Hotel,"This was such a beautiful boutique hotel.  It smelled amazing every time you walked in the door and the cozy feel always made you feel welcome. I actually bought the candles they burned in the hotel they smelled so good.  The rooms were small but so well laid out.  The bed was very comfortable, the coffee in the room was delicious and everything was clean.  I didn't eat at the hotel but there was a great cafe across the street that made a delicious egg sandwich each morning while I was there.  The hotel is very close to Tottenham court road tube station which makes it very easy to get around. I would definitely stay here again.  
Thanks

115,"Outstanding hotel, great location","Stayed in the hotel this past weekend to go to a show and do a little christmas shopping. On arrival we were warmly greeted by the hotel staff and made our way to our room.

The room was spacious and the bed very comfortable. All the staff were very pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was well cooked and ample choice.

The hotel is ideally placed for shopping on Oxford Street and not far from Soho and Leicester Square.

Although not the cheapest hotel, it is ideal for a special occasion.

Only small issue is the building work in the area that can be heard in the hotel, especially early on Sunday morning, but it didn't impact on our stay.",5,2014,11,11
115,No Place Like Home,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is my home in London.  I hope to return, once again, to enjoy its close proximity to many must see locations, great food, great service, and great comfort.  I'm so happy to call it home.  Its understated elegance and quality satisfy my sense of aesthetics.  Its history is very interesting.  I suggest you research its background as the YWCA central Club. Long live The Bloomsbury because it is my home in London.",5,2014,11,10
115,"Very nice hotel, good location for seeing shows 😊","My partner and I had a lovely stay at this hotel. 
Abdul went above and beyond what was expected of a member of staff.
Would recommend this hotel.
A negative, expensive bar and mini bar prices ridiculous but to be expected in London.

115,Very nice hotel with even better staff,Spent 2 nights in very comfortable and very well appointed room. With very efficient free wifi.  Also excellent dinner in hotel Resteraunt with lovely fish. Best tea true of the hotel is the very efficient and universally charming staff.,5,2014,11,09
115,Excellent service,"Just stayed for one night following a meeting in London. Lovely room, first class service from all members of staff. Hearty breakfast set us up for a busy day in town. Will become our new first choice when we are in London.",5,2014,11,08
115,Pleasant stay. Definitely recommend a stay.,"We only had two nights at the Bloomsbury and I wish we could have stayed a bit longer. The bellmen, particularly Mario, went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable.

The Thursday night jazz performance was phenomenal! It was only disappointing that more people were not there to enjoy it.

The hotel is in a fantastic location. It's a short, 5-minute walk to the tube. A little more of a walk and you can find great shopping and a dizzying array of food(Indian, Chinese, traditional British, Mediterranean).

The Bloomsbury could just be our home base for future visits to London.

The Juicery",4,2014,11,07
115,Perfect Experience,"I loved my stay at The Bloomsbury - staff were friendly and helpful, the hotel itself was lovely and so convenient: within walking distance to many great attractions. I walked to most places, but also there's a tube stop around the corner. I have been recommending this hotel to people left, right and centre. I strongly encourage you to try it!",5,2014,11,06
115,"4 Fantastic nights at the fabulous Bloomsbury Hotel, London","We picked this hotel due to its close proximity to the many theatres, and its central location in London for the mid term break.

We arrived late in the late morning, tired and hungry, Head Chef Paul O'Brien provided wonderful food.  His mantra was” Treat it like your home”.  He was ably assisted by Maria and her staff who for breakfast and afternoon tea always had a warm welcome,  Malaka deserves special mention for exceptional service above and beyond the call of duty.  Nice music and a very knowledgeable Mr Joe made late nights/early mornings in the hotel lounge extremely enjoyable and relaxing.  The concierge was very knowledgeable and efficient in providing information and especially transport for us at short notice.  Our room was spacious, clean, warm and homely.  We will certainly be returning when we are next in London.

The  Doyle Group have a hidden gem in the Center of London with an incredible group of staff who are professional, courteous, warm and have certainly been immersed in the Chéad Míle Failte.  The Doyle Group and hotel management should feel very proud of this achievement.",5,2014,11,04
115,Excellent weekend stay,"Great value- booked through ebookers, just behind dominion theatre Tottenham court rd, great location, 3 mins walk to British Museum, staff very friendly and recommended great restaurants to try, 24 hr diner over rd surprisingly good, would stay again.",5,2014,11,04
115,Our London trip,"This hotel was centrally located to everything we needed. 
Close to the theater, dining, shopping. It was perfect. We could walk everywhere and also easy to get a cab when we needed .
Great food. Excellent staff would recommend a stay for anyone. Would like to come back.",5,2014,11,04
115,"Great Hotel, Great Staff, Great Location","We had originally booked 2 nights at The Bloomsbury Hotel, but tacked on a third night at the beginning of the stay after spending the first half of our trip to London miserable at another hotel -- could not have been happier with that decision.

There was some confusion at the front desk initially, as they didn't understand my having dual reservations and tried to check me into both rooms at once.  This after not being able to find the original reservation until I looked up the confirmation on my phone.  But after those few bumps, all went smoothly.  The staff made sure we were able to stay in the same room for all three nights despite having split reservations, something we greatly appreciated.  We had a room on the 8th floor which was very cozy and extremely quiet.  The lone window faced an interior courtyard, so no view -- but also no street noise whatsoever.

The room was clean, modern and well-appointed.  The bathroom had heated floors and a heated mirror, plus a very nice shower head.  The room was spacious by London hotel standards.  Our only gripes were that the bed was far too soft for our liking, and we had some issues with the thermostat.  It was unseasonably warm during our stay, so we tried to run the a/c almost continuously, but it would switch over to heat every once in a while.  The thermostat was difficult to use and at times unresponsive, which actually required a call to the front desk so they could remedy the situation (albeit temporarily).

As far as location goes, you cannot ask for better for exploring London.  Just steps from the nearest tube, many major areas and attractions are within comfortable walking distance.  There are wonderful restaurants in the area, and some good shopping as well.  The only hiccup here is that there is major construction happening on the Tottenham Court Road tube stop which has closed the road off, making road/taxi travel a little tricky -- but the tube itself is still functional, so there's absolutely no need for cabs with the train right there and so much within walking distance!

We had breakfast two of our three mornings, as we booked the breakfast-inclusive rate.  This gave us access to the buffet (croissants, yogurt, fruit, etc) as well as hot food from the kitchen.  We enjoyed everything we ate there.

I would absolutely recommend this hotel to those looking to explore London.  Comfortable luxury, spectacular location, extremely accommodating staff, and free in-room wifi -- you really can't go wrong!",4,2014,11,03
115,Beautiful Hotel!,"Lovely overnight stay in this beautiful and stylish hotel, very friendly staff and the hotel felt warm and personal but at the same time extremely professionally run. Couldn't have asked for more. Superb location too! 
      ",5,2014,11,03
115,Beautiful hotel in a beautiful area,"The staff greeted us with a warm welcome and were very friendly and attentive.  The hotel building itself is beautiful and our room was clean and well-equipped, if a little small (we were on one of the top floors).  Although the hotel is quite large, it did not feel impersonal and it had the feeling of a boutique hotel, beautifully decorated with caring staff.

115,Tipp to London,Excellent place to hang your hat highly recommended to all visitors to London whether your on a holiday or business the location is second to none - the weather been excellent for the end of October was a huge plus of course,5,2014,11,03
115,Prizewinner,"I won a two night stay a the hotel in a competition and was so impressed with the hotel and the welcome that I am going to book to come back and will definitely recommend to friends.

The hotel is gorgeous and very comfortable, nothing is too much trouble for the staff and they go out of their way to accommodate guests, we were so happy with our stay and it is so central, you can get to anywhere in London easily from the location.

The food was excellent and the staff friendly ad knowledgeable about the area and what was going on in London in general - give it a try, you will not be disappointed!

115,"Nice Hotel, Close to Lots","Got this hotel on one of the hotel booking sites for a great deal.  Comfortable, clean, close to tube and lots of shopping and restaurants.  Am from the US and was new to traveling in London so I wasn't sure where to stay, booked this by hotel class and wasn't sorry.  Service was attentive and friendly.  Would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,11,02
115,Afternoon Tea the best!,I was visiting London for the day yesterday and had afternoon tea here before going to see Evita at the Dominion Theatre round the corner. It was fabulous. The scones were the best I had ever eaten. Our waiter was charming. I would love to eat one of their delicious scones again right now. Recommended!,5,2014,11,02
115,2014 New Year's Day stay,"I am submitting a belated review of a 2-night stay I had at The Bloomsbury Hotel starting on New Year's Day 2014.  I was quite happy with my time at The Bloomsbury, especially because the gentleman staffing the front desk (from Canada, I believe) when I arrived early in the morning (I had just arrived on the red-eye from Newark, NJ (EWR)) did his best to get a room ready for me much earlier than official check-in.  I arrived around 8:30 in the morning and I waited in the lobby charging my devices while this individual got me into my room sometime between 10:00 and 10:30 am, which on New Year's Day was a terrific accomplishment!  I greatly appreciate his efforts, especially considering how tired I was.

While the room was slightly ""compact,"" I was traveling alone and wasn't spending much time there.  It was clean and comfortable, I loved that the electrical outlets also accommodated US cords, and that the wifi was so strong.  I enjoyed the gym and the coffee/tea in the lobby, and thought the location was incredibly convenient (no more than a 3-4 minute walk from the Tube).  I will give serious thought in staying here again upon my next visit to London.",4,2014,11,02
115,Great hotel,"Stayed for 4 nights at the Bloomsbury Hotel. Beautiful hotel! Very confortable and clean room, very friendly staff, good location in central London but in a calm street. I will be sure to come back! The only negative was the breakfast, which in my view was not not worth its price.",5,2014,11,02
115,Lovely hotel with a fantastic location,"We stayed at The Bloomsbury Hotel London for our wedding anniversary. On booking on-line i put in the notes that this was my reason for our stay. When we got into the room they had left us a lovely decorated marble board with 3 little cupcakes wrapped and tied with a ribbon and a handwritten wedding anniversary card. A really lovely touch and a fantastic start to our weekend. 

The hotel in general including our room was extremely clean and beautifully decorated. The location was fantastic, everything on our doorstep. We hardly used the Underground to get around! 15/20 minute walk from Euston Station and 5 minute walk to Prince Edward Theatre which was our main reason for our stay. Plenty of high street shops, bars and restaurant literally just round the corner.

My ONLY criticism was that on both mornings we stayed for breakfast there just didn't seem to be enough staff on. We had to keep stopping a passing member of staff to take our main food order some of which seemed very harassed. We would be seated and bought tea/coffee and toast but then nobody returned. Unfortunatly we noticed we weren't the only guests who were having to doing this. Overall though I would definitely recommend this hotel even though it was a little expensive!",5,2014,11,02
115,Absolutely Fantastic,"Great room, excellent location and extremely helpful staff. We couldn't praise this hotel more. If you're looking for a hotel in London, stay here. It is walking distance to many attractions and is close to tube/bus. We will definitely be returning soon. ",5,2014,11,01
115,overnight for a west end show,"My wife and I stayed here in Oct 2014 for an overnight break with a show in the west end. We've stayed here before, and got another good deal on one of the hotel booking sites. The hotel is very nice, modern and really well located around the corner from Oxford St / Tottenham Ct Rd tube. We walked the 10 minute stroll to Soho for dinner and the show. 
The rooms are good, we opted for the entry level room which was compact, but very clean and comfortable. We didn't have breakfast due to the price of it, but to be honest, within a minutes walk of the hotel there are 1000 places you can get breakfast for a fraction of the price the hotel wanted to charge. 
The Landseer bar downstairs in the hotel was lovely for an aftershow drink and chill out. The drinks are very very pricey, but I guess you expect that in London. 
All in all, this s a great hotel if you get it at a decent rate on one of the hotel booking sites and opt for eating out. I would definitely stay here again for a west end show and easy access to Oxford St shopping.",4,2014,11,01
115,Poor Service or rather No Service.,I didn't stay at this hotel so cannot comment on the overall experience.    Called in for coffee with a business associate but after waiting nearly 15 minutes while the staff decided to have a long conversation between themselves we left with a decided bad impression!    Maybe we were just unlucky because this hotel gets generally high marks from guests but there's really no excuse for this in what is supposed to be an upmarket establishment.,2,2014,10,31
115,Great Location,"Great location and great service.

Unfortunately, the rooms were a bit small. But the WIFI was so good, I was able to host a meeting without any issues which is not bad for hotel wifi!!!

The rooms did have US electrical outlets and really good air conditioning.

Worth EVERY penny to stay here!",4,2014,10,31
115,Long weekend at Hotel Russell in London,"I have just returned from a 4-day stay in London with my husband. Hotel Russsell is our absolutely favourite hotel. It has a superb location, with easy distance from London attractions, especially if you are a fan of the British Museum which is just around the corner. It is next door to a Picadilly line tube station and only 2-3 stops away from the West End. 
The hotel has unique atmosphere of the 19th century opulence, with all the modern facilities. It has historic links with the Bloomsbury group of writers and poets, it's mentioned in TS Eliott's Cats. Russell Square, Bedford Square and, Tavistock Square are all there within walking distance. 
The hotel is very comfortable, feels like home away from home. The staff  are helpful and polite.
I had tried various Bloomsbury hotels but after my first stay at the Russell I wouldn't stay anywhere else.",5,2014,10,30
115,"Great location, not cheap but it is central London","The location of the hotel couldn't be better - 2 mins from Tottenham Court Road tube, Soho, Oxford Street and Covent Garden all in easy walking distance.  Hotel is very nice, the best smelling reception ever (sounds an odd comment, but it was!), rooms are small for the price (it is London) but are very nice.  Overall, excellent hotel, great location, nice staff, very comfortable room and everything you could need.",4,2014,10,29
115,Five days at the Bloomsbury,"Stayed here at the beginning and end of our European vacation.  Rooms are lovely, service and staff excellent, and location superb -- 5 minutes from an Underground stop, short walk to Charing Cross road and bookshops, and to   some excellent restaurants, as well as a short walk to the Theater district, down the street from the British Museum.  Brian the concierge was awesome!  Will definitely stay here on a return trip to London.",5,2014,10,29
115,% Star Dining experience,"I didnt stay at the hotel and so I cannot comment on the rooms but the food and service was excellent.  We attended a dinner for 40 friends and acquaintances in one of their private dining rooms (The Albion).  The room was beautifully set out with full linen and silver service. The first course of fillteted mackerel & salad was exquisite, followed by chicken rolled in panchetta and stuffed with apricot served with potato gallette and then a scrummy pudding and coffee.  Excellent and swift service and food that looked and tasted the part and at a reasonable price. I reccomend it for a good party venue.",5,2014,10,29
115,Excellent service!!,"Fantastic stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel. We were celebrating a birthday and the staff made it extra special. 

The hotel itself is excellent. Room was a good size, had lovely decor and very clean! Service at front desk was great.

Location is perfect, right next to Tottenham Court Road station. Plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. We visited Hakkassan that evening which was a few minutes walk away.

Overall a great stay!",5,2014,10,28
115,A gem of a hotel in the heart of the city.,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is a wonderful hotel.  From my arrival to departure, the staff were welcoming and helpful. The location is perfect. Rooms were above and beyond comfortable. I will be staying again ",5,2014,10,27
115,Excellent Stay,"Had a meeting in London and thought I would make the most of it and asked my wife to meet me at the hotel. Wonderful greeting, excellent room and fabulous service. Put me in the good books at last!! Would thoroughly recommend staying there and a visit to the bar!",5,2014,10,27
115,Room size???,"I booked 2 superior double room through booking.com. When I arrived, I only placed in the standard room. I think I got cheated. There is no Superior double room, only superior queen and superior king.Then why I paid more?  The hotel is also changing the mini bar system, my fruits and drink are locked inside and cannot get back!!!  Before 7:00 am everyday, I can hear the sounds of clearing the trash. On the last day of my stay,  the wifi in the room is not working. I missed lots of important mail.
The location is good, near the museum, covent garden and Oxford Street.",3,2014,10,26
115,Perfect location,"Great welcome, deluxe room very comfortable and roomy ...Room 212, facing the stage door of the Dominion Theatre.

Couple of issues including desk lamp not working, area where a mini-bar had been incredibly dusty (attended to by housekeeping on request) & bathroom fan noisy. These issues didn't affect me until 4 am on my second night so I did not lodge a complaint at the time. Have emailed hotel to make them aware of these issues for future patrons but, to date no response.

Breakfast was a superb affair - possibly the best choice of food I've had in the UK - wait-staff were polite & you were addressed by name, which was a personal touch. Also great was the weekend breakfast time of 7.30-11.30 am. Faultless.

The hotel lobby and public areas were immaculate and classy. All staff encountered were incredibly friendly and very professional.

The location is perfect for the West End/Soho/British Museum.

An overall superb stay ..... would go back tomorrow.",4,2014,10,25
115,Unbeatable service,"Excellent hotel with first class service! We were early for check in so left our luggage with Concierge. Reception called to let us know when our room was ready.
It was my Birthday during our stay and I was delighted when two glasses of champers and a lovely decorated cake arrived! This wasn't all-when we arrived home that evening the bed and bathroom sink area had been decorated with candles and petals, chocs were left bedside.
Concierge were very helpful and friendly and always asked about your day.
The only gripe would be rooms very warm even with heating as low as possible. But all in all a fabulous hotel, would definitely return.",5,2014,10,25
115,Bloomsbury Hotel,Excellent 3 night stay at this hotel as a birthday trip. It is a small and very well located hotel. Very pleasant and quiet rooms. The staff went out of their way to be welcoming and helpful. Breakfasts were excellent with special mention to Estelita who managed the breakfast services so well and to the senior concierge who was extremely helpful in providing information and maps,5,2014,10,25
115,A gem in museum and theatre country,"This small boutique hotel on Great Russell Street is a block from The British Museum, close to the National Gallery, and within walking distance of dozens of theaters.  The rooms are comfortable and well equipped.  The staff is attentive.  The bar and restaurant are quiet, and quite good.  We would stay again and highly recommend it, especially to those who are interested in museums and theatre.",5,2014,10,24
115,"Great location, our room had no real window","This hotel is in great location, walking distance to the British Museum and the tube, easy access to almost every attraction in London. The staff is very nice, especially the concierge, he really did make out trip better with suggestions about sites, transportation and day trip tips. The room was nice and clean (except for the bathroom which was gross) but for the space they cramped up too much furniture to the point where I had to crawl onto the bed, because I could not walk around it, there are 15 cm between the bed and the wall on one side. But we had a full size desk, which is totally unnecessary. The room we were put into had no real window, the window was a shaft looking across to someone else's window. If you are staying there, ask for a room with window and walking space around the bed.",3,2014,10,24
115,Terrific hotel,"We stayed here with a group from CT on a theatre tour.  If you are a walker, it was very convenient to many of the theatres.  This is a first-class hotel.  The lobby and common areas are spacious and beautifully appointed.  Our room was a good size, with a very comfortable bed and 2 upholstered chairs, as well as a desk.  Free Wi-Fi is a great perk.  Every room amenity was provided:  mini bar; cups and saucers, a Keurig-type coffee maker, another pot for heated water for tea, a safe.  Unfortunately,  all of these items were placed in the closet, which, if I hadn't rearranged everything that was movable, would have left us with 1 drawer, and 1 shelf.  The included breakfast was served in a lovely space on the lower level and was varied and very good.
I would certainly stay here again....if the hotel either frees up some drawer space, or adds a dresser.",5,2014,10,23
115,The service was the WOW factor,"You take a chance staying in a city centre hotel. Either they are style over substance, as we experienced at one hotel in Paris, or they are patronizing and condescending as I've experienced a couple of times in Barcelona. I'm happy to say that The Bloomsbury is none of those things.

From the moment my wife and I arrived until the moment we went back to pick up our cases, everything was perfect. From the engagingly conversational receptionist who offered warm hand towels as we checked in, to Brian, the nicest guy and best concierge I've met in a hotel, we couldn't have asked for more.

The room was ideal considering we backed onto the Dominion theatre. I was half expecting to be kept awake to the strains of Don't Cry For Me Argentina, but the soundproofing protecting us from the outside world was spot on. The bed was big and comfy, the bath and shower had permanent hot water, and the complimentary slippers and robes made for a relaxing evening.

Whilst we didn't partake, the room service menu was extensive, as too the restaurant menu but we did have the amazing breakfast and there was a wonderful selection of alternatives to the English version. Finally, the complimentary glasses of champagne (it was our wedding anniversary) as we waited for our taxi to leave was an excellent way to bid farewell.

Not only am I glad we stayed here, I would definitely stay here again and would happily recommend to anyone staying in the capital.",5,2014,10,23
115,Tries very hard to please,"This hotel definitely goes the extra mile to be much better than your typical London hotel, which lets face it, if you're not prepared to part with some serious cash can be a hit and miss affair. Check was friendly with the welcome offer of a glass of lemonade. The room was compact but still very comfortable. The hotel is very warm, perhaps a bit too warm but I left the air con on all night and slept moderately well, with the help of the black out blinds. The better however was too soft. The pluses for the room included the modern bathroom, great toiletries, free wifi, tea and nespresso machine, nice functional furniture and fluffy robes. Breakfast was above average and the free newspapers a nice touch. At check out the complimentary bottos of water was a nice touch. All this is located a stones throw from Tottenham Court Rd Tube making it a very convenient haven in the heart of the West End. With all the shops, restaurants and even a Waitrose round the corner this place is hard t beat!",4,2014,10,21
115,Great hotel,"Great location, great room and staff. 
Our room was ready when we arrived at 1pm so this was a great start,the room (a suite )was what we had hoped for spacious with a great bathroom. We had breakfast which was lovely. Checkout was painless and we left our luggage at the hotel so we could spend the day luggage free.",4,2014,10,21
115,Amazing Location,The hotel is right by the University and also Oxford Street. It is so close to SoHo also and a lot nicer then hotels in that area. It has a nice mix of modern and old English style. I loved how big the rooms are also.,5,2014,10,20
115,Dirty sheets at this price?,"When I arrived at the hotel, no one assisted me in carrying luggage up a long flight of stairs despite the fact that staff were standing just inside the door at the top.

When I reached my room, there was a huge visible stain on the bedspread.  I called the desk and the manager offered a lower quality room at the same price that might be cleaner.  When the manager escorted me to the second room it also had a huge visible stain on the bedspread.  Clearly the housekeeping staff do not care.  The manager was embarrassed but offered no way to fix the situation or any compensation.  I returned to the original room with the dirty bedding.  

When I left the hotel after six nights, despite requesting assistance, no one was available to help me with my bags down the flight of stairs.  So I left as I arrived..dragging my own bags despite paying thousands of pounds to stay at The Bloomsbury.

All around the staff were pleasant but useless.  They all seemed like people who worked in a high end hotel but had never actually visited a high end hotel.

I expect that I will now recieve a nice form email from the managers saying that they are sad that my stay was not up to standard.  Just not good enough for the price being charged.  

I'll stay at the Charlotte Street Hotel next time I'm in London.

115,Excellent location and quiet,"I asked for a quiet room and received one, at the end of a hallway not facing the street. (It was a pleasant surprise to have the request honored, as the last time I asked for a quiet room at an urban hotel I was put directly across from the elevator). This may have been the quietest urban hotel I've ever experienced.

The location is fabulous, down the street from the British Museum and an easy walk to Soho, West End theater and Trafalgar Square. You're in the heart of activity yet on a quiet street. While just a block or so from Oxford Street, note that if you want to hit shopping landmarks like Selfridge's or Fortnum & Mason, you may want to hop on the underground (which is very close and convenient).

Bed was comfortable, bathroom always had piping hot water and good pressure. 

Room is not huge, but it was large enough for our needs, being able to have our suitcase out and still walk round the bed. There was even a small desk to sit at. This is in a major expensive city and I wasn't expecting spacious. It would have been nice to have some drawers to unpack clothes beyond just the small closet, and it really would have been handy to have some hooks to hang clothes on, but these were minor nits.

Our room was always clean, thanks to usual daily room service plus early evening turn-down that also included emptying trash and taking away used dishes (nice if you take advantage of the free coffee/tea in the room). Service was generally efficient and useful (despite 1 day of a maid looking annoyed when we said yes, we wanted turndown service), although I would have liked a better eating recommendation from one of the staff than sending me to a chain restaurant round the corner.

There was free Wi-Fi, which was not always as fast and reliable as I would like (uploading the occasional photo varied from quick & instant to need to try several times), but certainly usable.

All in all I'd recommend the Bloomsbury, and I'm rather picky about accommodations.",5,2014,10,20
115,Amazing hotel!,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here for 1 night in August and the hotel is absolutely gorgeous. We arrived late after travelling down to London but the staff were really welcoming. Our room was a deluxe room and it was lovely and really spacious! We took a bottle of champagne with us and the hotel staff brought us up a bucket of ice & two glasses at no cost! 
The location is ideal, a short walk to oxford street. 
Would definitely stay again.",5,2014,10,19
115,One night Business Trip,"Booked here for an overnight,
Easy to get to from London City Airport on the DLR/Tube.

First impressions were good, staff friendly and attentive.  Location is excellent tube close by, short distance from theatres, restaurants and chinatown 

Had a room on the 8th Floor, which was very hot even without the heating on, had to open window straightaway and leave open for a while.  I imagine this might be an issue for some, room was very pleasant, comfy room, very comfy bed.

The room has a nespresso machine, which did not work, but I had a wake up call with a complimentary coffee delivered so all was fine.  I dined in the bar, which is downstairs on lower ground, music whilst nice was too loud, and the bar is part of the restaurant, which would not be my preference, it would be much cosier and intimate if separated. The experience was average, I had the charcuterie (small) which was plenty and the superfood salad. The salad was supposed to contain edamame, but for some reason was overlooked and not included yet still served which was disappointing.  Wine was average for the price.  

I would stay here again, but would most likely dine/drink elsewhere.",4,2014,10,19
115,Lovely hotel- would definitely stay again,"Lovely hotel, large rooms with great amenities. Staff very friendly and even made us a birthday cake upon arrival. Decor is lovely throughout and 1 minutes walk from tottenham court tube station. We will definitely stay here again. ",5,2014,10,19
115,Another satisfied customer,"This hotel is friendly , warm and welcoming. They do genuinely want you to enjoy your stay at their hotel. The bedrooms are of a good size even for London. It is well cared for and gives a relaxed atmosphere. Love this hotel. The breakfast room is in the basement and is tastefully decorated. The breakfast offers a nice selection of food for various nationalities too. The smoked fish risotto was delicious and the three egg omelette also.
All London hotels have become even more expensive but this one offers good value for money. No complaints",5,2014,10,19
115,Disappointing,"We High hopes when we booked the hotel because of it's central location.  You can hear everything in the hallways almost as if your door was ajar.  Bathtub didn't drain when showering. Bellmen were very pleasant but didn't follow through on requests, didn't bring luggage stand.  Most importantly, I pre-ordered a car to bring us to airport the day before we left and the next morning they didn't have our name on the list!  Very stressful when you are leaving to come home.  I wouldn't recommend this hotel.",3,2014,10,18
115,An amazing time at a great hotel,"Just had the most amazing time at the Bloomsbury Hotel. Great locations, 5 minutes from the tube and close to Oxford Street, perfect for shopping. When we arrived the door was opened for us and walked in to beautiful receptions. The staff could not of been more helpful, the room was amazing, you expect luxury, but there were some unexpected extras. The deluxe fruit plate and aromatherapy toiletries .... coffee machine. Great nights sleep and then it was time for breakfast, everything you could want and more, in comfortable surroundings with attentive staff. Was made to feel very special. It was a birthday weekend for my sister's 30th and she had the best time, thank-you we look forward to coming back.",5,2014,10,18
115,Comfortable and Well Located Bloomsbury Lived Up To Our Expectations,"Bloomsbury Hotel is a comfy retreat in a good location.  Outstanding housekeeping with clean room and bathroom,  very comfortable bed and bed linen.  The coffee and tea facilities were more than satisfactory.  The room decor is modern and cosy.  Thanks very much to the Guest Relations Manager who obliged us by supplying us with extra room keys for rooms 603 and 606.  He was very patient, obliging and efficient.  At all times, very knowledgeable of the hotel and assisted us in other queries. We wish to convey our sincere thanks to him for his prompt and professional service on the evening of 7 Oct. He is an asset to the hotel.   Concierge staff were always helpful and polite. 
Kudos to Housekeeping Staff who were clean, neat and honest.  

Rooms were well decorated with modern style and facilities.  Wifi was fast and strong. 

Would be better if there was a ramp for our luggage to be wheeled up and down easily.  On checking out, we had heavier bags due to all our shopping.  It's a struggle for cab drivers and concierge staff to haul big bags up and down the steps.

We look forward to returning to the Bloomsbury on our next visit to London.",4,2014,10,18
115,Pampered!,"I´ve stayed the first week of October with other couple for 5 nights. The rooms were spacious, quiet and very very fashion design. All the service was outstanding from check in; very personalized and friendly staff, housekeeping very attentive with our needs; we didn´t note their presence, and waiters at breakfast; the warmest staff I ever met, Stelita was incredibly charming and Alexandra surprised us speaking fluent spanish making us feel home and explaining the menu. Special mention to the breakfast, which has a huge variety of fresh fruits and pastries. The hot food was delicious from a la carte menu and quickly served. We decided to attend a ""Jazz night"" and it was the best option compared to other Jazz Clubs that we tried before. The food was tasty and the Jazz, absolutely out of this world. We had an amazing and unexpected night. I would like to mention as well the Concierge Team, very talented and attentive, offering directions and help at all time. I will strongly recommend this hotel to my friends and will come back 100% sure!",5,2014,10,18
115,Central and excellently served and managed,"I stay often in this hotel whenever I am in London and I am a frequent visitor.
Location is perfect next to Oxford street,Theatre land and all attractions in the city.
The service is excellent and the staff is really nice and attentive,especially at breakfast.I was very pleasantly and nicely served by Estelita and Chris.
Everybody in the hotel is willing to help and that's a huge difference when it comes to defining what a nice hotel is.
I can totally recommend it.

The guys on the door are happy to walk down the street to her you a taxi- which is lovely- especially if it's cold and wet out! Good sized, clean rooms. Great restaurant and bar! Love the fresh flowers and scented candles on the ground floor.. ",5,2014,10,17
115,Great- only minor point was small room.,"Just had an overnight stay. Stayed in a standard double and it was small - the bathroom was almost as big. I took the cheapest online deal so probably that was the reason. Anyway, don't let that put you off- lovely hotel in good location. We didn't ask to be moved as we were out all of the time, but I'm sure the very friendly reception staff would have helped if they could.",5,2014,10,16
115,Weekend break,Great friendly hotel with extremely helpful staff.  Good clean and spacious rooms with excellent room service.  Friendly concierge  who assist you in an out of taxi.  Organise of site seeing trips.  A definite must if you want to be pampered ,4,2014,10,16
115,A great hotel!,"I've been coming to The Bloomsbury Hotel for about 4 years now on a regular basis and am never disappointed. The location is super central (close to the tube and bus routes; walkable for the City and Central London) and the service is excellent.

I typically get upgraded due to my status and enjoy the spacious room and full bath. I stayed in 308 this trip and it was very quiet - a special thanks to Louise at the front desk for not only assigning me a quiet room, but also for giving me access prior to the check-in time.

I booked online and got a special rate that included a full cooked breakfast. It was a nice treat each morning, but not something that I would typically pay extra for.

I'll be back!",5,2014,10,15
115,Best hotel in London.,"We stayed for six days. It was great hotel. Good situation near the British Museum,Covent Garden and Piccadilly. The staff always friendly, we had comfortable time. The breakfast was very delicious and all stuff very kindly for us. Ms ESTELITA always worries about us. Of course, We wanna stay again when we back to London.",5,2014,10,14
115,very satisfied,"Good situated near the British Museum and the Pancras railstation.
Personnel very friendly.
Standard room small but comfortable equipped; a little bit noisy.
Breakfast very good but expensive.
Ventilation too noisy, we stopped it and opened the window.

115,Great Place to Stay,We stayed for four nights and had a wonderful time.  The staff were always on hand to help and nothing was a trouble for them.  From checking in to checking out everything was great.  The breakfast was especially good with an excellent choice of hot and cold food.  We will definitely stay again and recommend to our friends.,5,2014,10,13
115,Great hotel and location,"Spent a few days in London going to see some of those attractions we had always missed before, so location was important. Seven Dials, Covent Garden within ten minutes walk, Trafalgar square twenty, British Museum five.
 We booked on a room only basis, as we wanted to try different places. Hotel has friendly and efficient staff and is immaculately maintained. Vey comfortable room. Didn't eat there, but bar is very cosy. So all in all, very satisfied.",5,2014,10,13
115,Best kept Secret,"I was pleasantly surprised when I entered the hotel. I was hoping for a hotel closer to my office but on walking in and being greeted this hotel met and exceeded my expectations. Beautiful surroundings, exceptional staff ready to help! I will definitely be staying there again!",4,2014,10,13
115,By far the best!,"When in London there's only one place to stay...
The Bloomsbury Hotel is located central to everything that's worth seeing, the rooms are exceptionally clean, food great and the staff couldn't do more to make your stay enjoyable. 
Having stayed here many times over the years, as a couple and then as a family I can honestly say that there's not another place like it - I'd never stay anywhere else when visiting the capital. 
",5,2014,10,13

115,Afternoon tea in very pleasant surroundings,"We came to London for a few days to celebrate our wedding anniversary and were given a voucher for tea for two at this hotel (£30 if paying). The building is very impressive, close to the British Museum. The staff are very friendly and extremely welcoming. The tea was excellent with a variety of sandwiches, scones and cakes with a multitude of teas and coffees to select from.",5,2014,10,12
115,Excellent choice,"We booked a theatre break in London and stayed at the Bloomsbury.  We could not have chosen a nicer hotel. We received excellent service from all the staff who were all exceptionally friendly, courteous and helpful and very welcoming. Our room was lovely, very clean and comfortable and the breakfast at the Landseer was outstanding.  Will certainly stay there again.",5,2014,10,12
115,Bloomsbury Hotel - The BEST,"My husband and I stayed at The Bloomsbury for 8 wonderful days!  There is absolutely nothing negative to say about this hotel, its rooms, amenities, staff and service.   We only wish we had been able to stay longer!
",5,2014,10,12
115,Excellent stay,"Very nice hotel! The location is excellent, with the tottenham court road underground station 2 minutes away. The rooms were spacious, clean and pleasant and included, among other things, an espresso machine and an iPhone docking station. But the best part of the hotel is the very helpful staff.  From the reception desk through the cleaning staff to the concierge, the service was outstanding.",5,2014,10,12
115,Lovely overnight stay,"We stayed just one night whilst in London for a theatre show. Hotel itself is lovely - the young receptionist - jonelle (??) is simply fantastic. Rooms good clean and perfect for a couple if nights 
We had booked and paid for breakfast also - BUT after sitting in the restaurant 15 minutes before our order was taken than sitting for a further 45 minutes - whilst people around us were being served - we left after a further 15 minutes and being assured our breakfast was coming! Then a different order coming over to us! 
We got our money back! 
Apart from that a lovely stay ",4,2014,10,12
115,Excellent stay ,"We arrived considerably early but were over the moon that they would let us in to our room. We were greeted immediately and our bags relieved from us. We had booked a superior room with breakfast at an excellent rate via their website. The room itself was lovely, comfortable and had everything that we needed. The view from room 424 was overlooking the front street and it was fine no noise and we had the window open all night. Not quite sure why people complain about the view when in a city hotel?! After 5 mins of being in our room 2 glasses of champagne arrived at our door we were delighted. We went out for the day not arriving back til nearly midnight. We returned to find that the room had been turned down and a plate of tarte au citron with an anniversary card had been left for us - a very nice touch. Breakfast was served until 11.30 in the morning which is good as it meant a sleep in could be had! We found the food at breakfast to be plentiful and enjoyable. 
Overall, my husband and I were very happy with our choice of hotel. The service we received was impeccable. The location is excellent. We would most definitely stay again. 
",5,2014,10,12

115,Beautiful Place,"Location:
An awesome location as it is close by the British Museum and Oxford Street. It is also a short walk to tube station. 

Room:
Very nicely decorated. Great style. While it leans toward ""design hotel"" kind of decor but very warm and comfortable. The bed sags a bit, which isn't nice for hotel of the level. The window is rather small therefore it is a bit dark. Bathroom is functional and has all the amenities one needs. 

Common areas; 
The lobby has high ceiling. The ambience exudes upscale and luxury. It does not feel overwhelm. Warm and intimate would be words to this describe it. 

Service:
The service I received was adequate. I got the key to my room in about 5 minutes. 

I highly recommend this hotel. If I remember correctly, I paid about $200+ per night which I think is a great value for its location, decor, and service.",5,2014,10,09
115,Nice! ,"My first room was too small and bed not comfortable, I did book the lowest category however. I was upgraded the next day and the room was much nicer. It has an old world charm but is modern in its decor. It's London , the rooms are never big nor the views anything special. I felt cosy and nice in my room - good airconditiong for those rare hot London days.

The staff in general were very friendly and Estalita (?) at breakfast was an absolute charmer. 
Breakfast was excellent although I was was offended by halal chicken as the standard offering. I'm Christian but I don't like anyone's religious believes forced on me let alone at breakfast. It's London not Dubai, and I don't care if you have lots of Middle East customers. 

Overall very nice.",4,2014,10,08
115,Holidaying,"Bloomsbury is one street away  from Oxford street and is very close to trains and buses(underground is around the corner and bus at either end of the short street. This was a must for me as I have back and hip issues.
The staff were very helpful and accommodating, especially the consierge Nalif who became like a family member and front desk person Rebecca who also made me feel part of their family.
The Bloomsbury was impeccable in every way.
Thank you again Bloomsbury
Belinda",5,2014,10,07
115,Great location,"I stayed at the Bloomsbury on a business visit to London. Although small, the rooms were very comfortable and staff were very friendly and helpful. Hotel's location is near the British Museum and ideal for a visit to the city.",4,2014,10,07
115,"Location good, rooms nice, service poor ","We stayed at this hotel on weekend of 4 October. The hotel itself is great but we found the service poor. We had booked for afternoon tea on the Saturday. After moving us between the lobby area and the dining room, they eventually settled us in the downstairs restaurant (basement location so limited natural light). Despite numerous staff coming and going we were ignored for 45 minutes. So much so that it was less of an afternoon tea and more of supper! Just as we were going to up and leave the food arrived. At £35 for cocktail tea I did not expect to be left waiting and flagging passing staff for help. The staff almost looked annoyed that we were asking to be served. So, in short, nice for the rooms and location but the manager needs to work on training his staff. This hotel could be exceptional, it was a shame this experience spoilt the start of our night away. Perhaps this should be considered for accommodation only. ",3,2014,10,05
115,Quiet and spacious in West End,"The rooms was clean, spacious and quiet. Especially compared to the average standards in London. The staff was friendly. The hotel is perfectly situated between lively Soho, a stonesthrow away from Chinatown and shares the street with the British museum.",5,2014,10,05
115,Box rooms,"This hotel looks impressive but if you book, ask about the room. We had a very small room and even smaller bathroom, no room for toiletries and no more than one person at a time!  Overcrowded (with furniture) room  for it's size and we were unable to walk around the bed, so one of us had to climb!  One small window looking across to another (similar) window so limited natural light. One unhelpful staff member just 'shrugged shoulders' when we complained and said nothing!  Have to say, other staff were very helpful, but the issue was not resolved. Very comfortable bed, good expensive equipment but at £220 per night, without breakfast - well overpriced. ",2,2014,10,04
115,First time,"Spent two pleasant nights here. Warm welcome with hot towels to refresh after the journey. Staff helpful and friendly. Room clean and comfortable with en suite with bathing essentials. Good turn down service with the customary chocolate. Breakfast continental or hot from the kitchen. Enjoyed both. Unfortunately cannot call a passing cab from the front entrance Concierge or staff member walk to Tottenham Court Road to bring a cab back to the hotel. Need to give notice to avoid a five/ten minute wait depending on the number of guest requiring the service. Will return. Good access to West End, theatres, public transport etc. Dominion Theatre five minute walk.",4,2014,10,03
115,An Unknown Gem,"I stayed here for one night again recently and it was better than my last stay. I received an upgrade to a superior room at checkin and was delighted with my room. Spacious by london standards with a nice bathroom and great shower. This trip I ate in the hotel and really enjoyed my 2 steak sandwiches and a top notch breakfast in bed. All in all IMO 5 star service at a very competitive 4 star price - especially by london standards. 

Other positives - excellent wifi. Great location. 

The negative - taxi drivers dont know the hotel. It happened twice this trip - which in london I find strange.",5,2014,10,03
115,Hotel amazing - Restaurant Service needs to improve,This is our second visit and although the hotel and front of house staff were brilliant the restaurant at breakfast was poor. We had to ask on both days for coffee or toast as it had not been delivered to our table. If it had been full we might have given them more time but they were not overly rushed.,4,2014,10,03
115,"Good, few misses this time","Second stay for business. Pros: location, cleanliness, elegance, food quality, US outlet, general comfort. The lobby smells like an Anthropologie store. Yes please. Cons: small shower, thin walls (some rooms), not able to hail a cab from hotel steps (they run down the street for you). Also, my colleagues were greeted with fruit baskets and warm towels. I just got a really hot room and the loudest neighbor ever.",4,2014,10,02
115,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay,The Bloomsbury is tucked away on a quiet street only 2 blocks from the Tube and a grocery store. The staff is extremely pleasant and helpful. My room was very comfortable and the bed was excellent. I need lots of back support and I got it. I had a free breakfast every day. It was WONDERFUL - a large buffet and the ability to order from the kitchen as well. I had a cheese and bacon omelet that was delicious!,5,2014,09,29
115,Anniversary weekend,"We arrived here on 27th September 2014 for our anniversary weekend.  Had booked this hotel as we were watching a show at the dominion theatre which was a couple of minutes walk away.  Arrived at the hotel to check in and the staff were very attentive from the start. When we arrived in our room I was shocked at how nice the room was. Lovely bed and marble bathroom.....excellent tea/coffee making facilities and everything else you would expect...iron and board, hair dryer, bathrobe and slippers, umbrella, safe, iPod Dock and complimentary toiletries and wi fi. Wifi was an excellent speed and my husband managed to stream a movie to his phone via Netflix whilst I was sleeping. We both slept very well and after showering and dressing we went down for breakfast.  Once again the staff were very attentive and after eating our first lot of toast we ordered a cooked breakfast which again came with extra toast and a pot of tea.  Everything served to you at the table.  There was also a help yourself buffet with cereals, yogurts, pastries and cheeses and ham and quaint bottles of freshly squeezed juice.  Nothing seemed to be too much trouble for the waiting staff.  I would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to anyone who was visiting london. Right from arriving into the grand foyer to checking out and being offered water for our journey all the staff were wonderful.",5,2014,09,28
115,Nice hotel but chaotic breakfast. ,"We chose The Bloomsbury Hotel because we were attending a performance of Evita. Really convenient because the hotel is virtually next door to the theatre. Lovely hotel, welcoming staff and our room was spacious and very well equipped. One slight problem was the shower door over the bath. Because there was virtually no deal between the door and the top of the bath it was impossible to avoid causing a mini flood on the floor. 

We chose to have dinner in the Landseer Restaurant in the hotel and again this was very enjoyable.

Unfortunately the stay was let down somewhat by the very disorganised service at breakfast. We had been left a note in our room that breakfast could be busy on the Sunday morning so we made sure we went down to the restaurant early. Unfortunately things were already going down hill. We had to wait ages for anyone to take our order and bring food, and chatting to several other guests afterwards we certainly weren't the only ones. Also - if you're going to serve toast, it's always a good idea to actually toast the bread rather than just walk it past the toaster !!

Overall we would certainly stay there again, but perhaps a senior manager should try experiencing the breakfast service themselves and see what they think. I'm sure the issues could be easily sorted out by an experienced restaurant manager. ",4,2014,09,28
115,Fantastic stay,"We visited in September 2014 and were extremely satisfied with our stay. The lobby and main room interiors were elegant and classic...like regal 1930's, which I loved. Our room was updated, clean, and comfortable. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Location was great; it was near tube and bus stops and was walkable to Carnaby Street, shopping, good restaurants, and parks. It is also close to theater. I would definitely stay here again!!",5,2014,09,27
115,Great location and restaurant,"Warning: the rooms are small for those accustomed to large US styled rooms, but what a pleasant stay. Very chic an nicely done. Close to the tube and the british museum which we visited twice during our stay. The worlds first YMCA is down the road, and a great indian restaurant Malabar is around the corner as well. Good service. Solid choice.",4,2014,09,27
115,"Wonderful stay, perfect location.","The Bloomsbury was just wonderful, stayed 3 nights. Got a great deal when booking with flight. Beautiful lobby and decor, great service, spacious rooms and an excellent location. Walking distance to most attractions and had nice restaurants nearby. We didn't have a chance to eat at the hotel since we always ate while out and about and we're looking for more reasonable options.",5,2014,09,25
115,Exceptional service,"Very friendly customer focused staff make up for any shortcomings this hotel may have.  Rooms are on the small side, but the lobby is great and is very inviting.  It's nice to sit there or gather there with your friends before you head out.  Central location close to everything.  Definitely felt like a 5 star experience at 4 star prices.",5,2014,09,25
115,Good hotel in great location,"We stayed here for 1 night and booked through Secret Escapes. I had emailed the hotel ahead of our visit with a couple of requests which were honoured. Check in was swift and we had a room on the 6th floor which was a good size, the only downside being that it had a small window and not a lot of natural light. As the furnishings were dark the room was a bit on the dark side. Otherwise it had everything we needed and was comfortable. We were given an anniversary cake and card which was very thoughtful. Breakfast was excellent. The bar was very cosy and lit with candles, as was the lounge and reception, even during the day. We had the best Bellinis in the bar. The staff are lovely and made us feel very welcome. The hotel is ideally situated just off the main road which was ideal for us. I certainly would choose this hotel again.",5,2014,09,24
115,Fantastic hotel and service,I visit and stay at this hotel often and am never disappointed with the service and attention to detail. The staff go out of their way to accommodate you and the overall ambience and location is fantastic. I would highly recommend!,5,2014,09,24
115,"Glenn, Cleethorpes","Very nice stay for 2nts. Nice clean hotel with friendly and attentive staff. Room was a very clean with all modern ammenities (sky sports/ ipod station, wifi etc).

115,just the right place to stay,"Very nice and friendly . the location is perfect close to lots of interesting spots to see most of them within walking distance . Our room the 431 was comfortable and very quiet , overlooking a covered inner courtyard , for us it was ok but may be it is not the best one if you need fresh air and are not very fond of air conditioning . 
All the staff we met during our 3 nights stay was highly profesionnal and understanding , we are french and were a bit out of practice with Shakespeare language , London has changed a lot since we last came 18 years ago except with foreign languages ... Anyway it won't be a reason for not coming again , we already are looking forward to .",5,2014,09,23
115,very pleasant and comfy experience,"I stayed here for 2 nights in August. The hotel was lovely, very clean, welcoming and cosy.
Staff was extremely polite and helpful. The room was very neat , compact and cosy.
Location was excellent, walking distance (6-8 mins) to Covent Garden. Near the british museum  and easy access to the Tour bus routes. 
highly recommend.",5,2014,09,23
115,"Upscale, and not snobby.","We just completed 7 nights in room 620. The room was spacious, very clean, and contained welcomed amenities such as a Nespresso machine, bedside reading lamps, and an in-room safe. Free Wi-Fi was strong and consistent.

The staff we encountered were all very polite, friendly, helpful and efficient, including Adella at the concierge desk, Paolo, Nalil and Muba at the front door, Ricky at the front desk, and Tanveer and staff in the breakfast room. Other unseen employees in the cleaning, kitchen, and maintenance departments also contributed immensely to our wonderful week in London.

The building is lovely and the location is great. Lots of interesting sites within walking distance.

Breakfasts are excellent, with lots of fresh fruit, meats, and breads. The egg dishes are also superb.

Will stay there again when next in London.",5,2014,09,21
115,love it,"Room 421 is my favourite..ive stayed four times going to shows in london..twice in room 421....I just love it. Room is beautiful,quiet and perfect for couples and weekends away. One of my alltime favourite hotels!!! 
Tell the staff if you have an anniversary/birthday etc...I told them it was my anniversary once and on arrival to the room, there was a bottle of champagne and a tray of fresh fruit. The bathroom and bath are fab and there is a flatscreen on the bathroom wall, so you can drink champagne, have a bath and catch up on ur tv before going to a show!!!",5,2014,09,20
115,Great place to stay,"Nice hotel with great location.  People were very friendly and check in was efficient, Rooms were very nice and internet worked very well. Hotel is close to everything including tube station. Would stay there again any time.",5,2014,09,19
115,Perfect London hotel!,"Lovely room, really personable staff, and less than five minute walk to the British Museum.  I was truly knocked out by how nice the employees were.The location was perfect.  The room was clean and modern.   I'll be back!",5,2014,09,19
115,First class!!,"As a weekly visitor to London I have stayed in many hotels.  That being the case you can become immune to your surroundings.  However, this was my first visit to The Bloomsbury & I have to say that it was a stand out.  The location is ideal for commuting around London but it is the modern style & elegance of the hotel coupled with the exemplary staff.  The facilities within the hotel are first class (gym/bar/restaurant) & the continental breakfast is possibly one of the best that I have ever come across.  I will definitely be back!",4,2014,09,19
115,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!","We stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel September 6th - 10th, 2014, and we loved it!  The hotel and the location is excellent.  The staff were wonderful and helpful in every way.  They even sent a signed card and anniversary/birthday dessert to our room.  The room is a little small, but very clean and well-decorated.  We found a great French restaurant nearby, Savoir Bistro, that we visited twice.  The hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood, but near Covent Garden and Leicester Square.  The tube and buses are convenient and close by.  Our only complaint is that it would have been nice to have breakfast included.  We would love to stay here again on our next trip to London.  In fact,  we are going to see if there are any Doyle Collection hotels in our next vacation cities of Budapest and Prague.  We wholeheartedly recommend the Bloomsbury Hotel.",5,2014,09,19
115,Best hotel service in London,"If you're coming to London you must stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel. Every member of staff goes out of their way to make your stay the best experience. They all remember your name. Thanks Tanveer and Elinita for making breakfast a great start to the day and Luis for cheerfully running down the street each day to bring us back a black cab. Thank you Michael (Hotel Manager) for the welcome champagne and for  rescuing us when we had our booking dates wrong. 
The restaurant and bar are great with private nooks for business meetings. Loved the comfy bed and linen. Wonderful people. Fabulous stay. A beautiful and luxurious hotel with old fashioned standards of superb service.",5,2014,09,18
115,Outstanding!,"This hotel is excellent! The General Manager, Michael Neve is an outstanding host with an exceptional team. The small touches make you feel at home. The location is great being a short walk to the city centre. Good restaurants, pubs and shopping all handy. All in all, we couldn't fault this hotel - would recommend to anyone visiting London.",5,2014,09,18
115,Pleasantly Surprised,"Our first trip to London and did not know what type of hotels we could expect.  When we arrived at The Bloomsbury Hotel, we were pleasantly surprised.  The doorman greeted us and took our bags to the Reception.  From the start, the staff was very friendly and customer focused.

Our checkin went without a hitch and we were escorted to our room; once inside, a bit smaller that what I guessed we would get but nevertheless, very comfortable with a king bed. The noise level was low and had no problem sleeping.

Breakfast was a great surprise; buffet style with an assortment of fruit, breads and even eggs to order that is included.  Ordered an everything omelet and was very good.  The staff was right on top of things from the moment you entered the restaurant.  They were well staffed and the customer service was top-notch.

We had arranged several tours in advance and the staff was extremely helpful with bus numbers to take, the underground locations.  They provided a map and would take the time to draw out the directions.

The location was very convenient, close to the British Museum, restaurants, and tour sites.  This hotel was a perfect way to start our vacation; felt welcome to London!",4,2014,09,17
115,Central location and excellent style,This hotel is well appointed with really good staff who gave professional and competent service. The breakfasts were all you could want when travelling.The central location made access to many London attractions really convenient and with an underground station at the end of the road it was super convenient. We would certainly stay here again.,5,2014,09,17
115,A fantastic break at 'The Bloomsbury Hotel',"A fantastic hotel, in a fantastic location. Could not fault it from the first welcome to the end of our stay. The location is perfect to explore the city and when you are tired you can relax in the beautiful hotel.",5,2014,09,16
115,"very helpful, nice hotel with great location","I really enjoyed my stay in this hotel. The location was great for me, as Oxford street was my push-off point for most days. Beds are firm but comfortable, standard rooms aren't terribly spacious but I'm used to that pretty much anywhere in Europe (if you want lots of space and huge beds, don't stay in boutique hotels! Go for big chains like Hilton... they've got the space but none of the charm). 

The gym facility was small but it was never packed so I didn't have any trouble accessing the equipment I wanted to. There's a  pool as well, though I didn't use it. I found the staff to be very welcoming and nice - they even penciled out a good running route for me for one of my workouts!

I DID use the executive lounge on my last day after check-out, and the complimentary coffee and snacks was very welcome.

My friend had a medical problem and they were a great help with that, checking up on us several times, sending us a free dinner, and helping us get in touch with a doctor.

I would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,09,16
115,Service not up to scratch,"My wife and I stayed at the Bloomsbury hotel on two occasions over the span of a week in Sep as part of our honeymoon to London. As much as we wanted to like the hotel, it was hard to overlook aspects of its service which left much to be desired. 

We had stayed in a deluxe room on the second occasion and found that the tile heating in the bathroom was not working. When I informed the male guest relations manager on duty about this, he said that not all rooms had the tile heating function. I then pointed out that it was advertised on their website that deluxe rooms came with this function and that our superior room which we had stayed in on the first occasion had the tile heating function. 

The manager subsequently made a show of writing down my request to look into this and to change the dirty kettle in the room and promised he would get someone to look into it. He clearly did not pass on the message because when we returned to our room that evening, nothing had been fixed. I informed the reception who sent someone up with a kettle and promised to send up a technician to look into the tile heating. No such technician came and we retired that night in our sadly cold bathroom. 

For the price it charges, service could certainly be improved. We will not return again.",3,2014,09,15
115,Sad excuse for service,"I can't fault the property which is pristine and roomy to a North American standard. However the service from the front desk staff and management left a lot to be desired. I left laundry on my bed and at 6am asked the front deskman to send housekeeping to get it as I was going out. Upon my return later that night it was still on the bed. Numreous discussions with the night manager yielded a million excuses but no solution and not even a 'sorry'. Discussions with the general manager the next day were equally as fruitless and annoying.
Another incident was around the air conditioning that would not go cool. At 12:30 my neighbor and I both complained to the front desk, who sent a 'technician' up only to say that the only way to cool off the room was to turn up the thermostat? !?!?! 
Epic fail and not worth the money there are brttrr options in that neighborhood for a cheaper price. Business travellers should avoid.",2,2014,09,14
115,"Overrated, Tiny Bedrooms","The hotel is in the former Queen Mary Hall, a historic building with a library and chapel on the first floor, good for small business meetings. The lobby has been tastefully upgraded while retaining the historic ambience.

However, one does not sleep in the lobby and even by London standards, the bedrooms, while tastefully decorated, are microscopic. My so-called superior room left me wondering what a standard room would look like. There was no air flow in the room, despite turning multiple knobs and switches on the placebo control unit. And the bathroom sink was the size of a dog bowl,

Since I was already paying $460 per night for aggravating my claustrophobia, I decided to take my breakfast at a cafe two doors down and pay 6 pounds instead of 20.

One note for disabled. There is an intimidating flight of steps leading to the front entrance but there is disabled access to the right side of the hotel.",2,2014,09,13
115,Great Weekend,"Stayed here with my partner and some friends for a weekend away.  What struck me most about the hotel were the staff.

From the moment we checked in, the welcome was warm and friendly. All staff (bar, reception, house maids, restaurant, etc) made us feel welcome and were very helpful. The hotel itself is perfectly located and the interior beautiful, a quite haven from the hustle and bustle of the city.

We will certainly be looking to return again in the near future.",5,2014,09,10
115,Great location!,"Very enjoyable stay. Staff were always pleasant and very helpful. Room was spacious and bed was really comfortable. Breakfast was lovely and staff very accommodating in providing variation from menu. Location is perfect for sightseeing, shopping and taking in a show. Plenty of places to eat nearby. Short taxi ride to a Gatwick or easily accessible using Gatwick Express & underground. 
Would definitely recommend this hotel if you want a little luxury after a long day out and about London.",5,2014,09,09
115,"""Hotel of excellence""","My husband and I are just back from a wonderful stay at the  Bloomsbury Hotel London. From start to finish it was a great first stay, from the greeting by the porter to the early check-in by the very friendly Ricky Collins, guest relations manager. It only got better and better, we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and received a very special cake creation from the hotel staff. The tourist information  we received from Nalif and Brian concierge was very helpful as it was our first time in the Bloomsbury area.. 
The Bloomsbury is exquisite, beautifully decorated and ideally situated, minutes from Covent Garden, Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road tube station. Our  bedroom (deluxe king room) was spacious, spotless and extremely quiet. 
Thank you all for a very memorable experience, we look forward to a return visit.",5,2014,09,09
115,Memorable stay in a great location,"Can't say enough about this wonderful hotel located in Bloomsbury by the British Museum. (And also close to the theatre district, SoHo, shopping, restaurants, and transportation).  We stayed for four nights in room 624 - a Deluxe Room - beautiful decor, spacious, very comfortable bed, seating area and all kinds of amenities. Our travel companion stayed in a standard room which she loved as well.  But it's the service of this hotel that makes it really stand out - the friendliness and helpfulness of the front desk and staff. We also enjoyed high tea there for the first time. Would recommend it wholeheartedly and will stay there again when next visiting London.",5,2014,09,08
115,"""Absolutely faultless ""","My daughter and I stayed at the Bloomsbury and loved the hotel. Our room was a superior double the decor and fittings were excellent , we couldn't of wish for better comfort then what we had. Our room had everything that one would possibly require. May I also praise the quality and comfort of the bedding it was complete bliss to sleep on!
We had a pre show meal in the evening where the waiter was very attentive and kindly made arrangements for a  taxi to take us to the theatre .

Thank you all for a wonderful stay, we will return

M.pollyn",5,2014,09,07
115,Short break in London,"Excellent service as soon as you arrive, very helpful reception staff. Excellent room even though it was overlooking the inner courtyard and it was a spotlessly clean and well furnished. Excellent decor throughout the hotel with relaxing and classy ambience particularly in the Landseer bar. Breakfast was excellent with once again attentive staff who ensured we were well served during our stay. Will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,09,07
115,Excellent hotel in central location,"We can only confirm all the positive reviews posted for this property. The hotel over-delivered on expectations mostly due to the excellent service provided by the front desk. The staff is very courteous and most helpful. Our room on the 8th floor was spacious and cozy, amenities were of high standard too, likely from a recent upgrading work. We also enjoyed the pub at the lower level, again for excellent service and good food/value. We surely look forward to our next stay at this hotel when returning to London.",5,2014,09,07
115,A lot of room to read poetry,"Frankly, all the wonderful things earlier reviewers have said about this gorgeous hotel are true. Service, rooms and amenities  are truly excellent. What's even more, the hotel fits perfectly into the literary ambience of Bloomsbury (Don't forget to visit the Seamus Heaney Library, part of the hotel's collaboration with Poet in the City; it was being worked on during our stapy, but still open). On a less poetic but nevertheless relevant note: the rooms and suites are bigger than in (the few) comparable hotels in the area; the studio suite we stayed in is 42 sqm, which gives you a lot of room to read poetry.",5,2014,09,07
115,Really Wonderful Stay,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury for six nights and were very pleased with the whole experience.  As noted on Trip Advisor, the staff is very friendly and attentive, and greeted us with a nice honeymoon congratulatory note -- although they assumed we were a straight couple -- and the gracious gift of a cream tea for two and drinks in the bar. The tea service is particularly nice. It's so great to stay at a beautiful hotel, in a great location, where the staff is so nice.  Our room was very comfortable and well appointed, and we slept well. My only recommendation would be to ask for a room with a shower only; the bathtub was a little hard to get in and out of for a shower, and the shower controls were hard to figure out; it took as a few days to figure how the shower worked. We would absolutely come back and stay again.",5,2014,09,06
115,Very good experience and promising for future improvements,"The hotel occupies a whole building that was originally accommodation (YHA I believe in the 1930s). Architecturally it is very interesting and beautiful internal decor to its original period; they have done a great job at refurbishing this place. I stayed in a superior double, that had both a bathroom and a shower room. Bathroom was great and less cramped than most London hotels. The room was a decent size (I had sooo much luggage...and it fitted!). The room was well equipped. I recommend this hotel and I am also going to suggest the following improvements: 1. the bedroom was very dark. I was trying to repack my suitcase and honestly could not see well enough with all the lights on. Not to mention reading, I simply could not read. Room numb was 216. 2. Quality of the bedlinen was good, but I asked for a foam pillow (to provide support to my neck) and it was very soft. Need to purchase proper foam pillows. 3. A big let down was the minibar. I emailed the hotel ahead of my stay to ask if they had a fridge in the room (I intended to buy some cheese and a bottle of wine to give to a friend). They said every room has a fridge - it's not correct, there is a minibar stocked with product and you cannot put your own stuff there. Honestly if this does not change I would not stay here again. I like to have my own fresh milk for tea and perhaps a yogurt in the fridge and here this is not possible. The hotel did however keep my cheese in the fridge for me though. 
Service was generally good - and in some areas better than expected. I had a cocktail and dinner in the bar (steak tartare) and the service was immaculate and the food great. The server was an Indian gentleman. I also had tea (literally, a pot of tea) served in reception and that was lovely too. It cost 5pounds and I don't mind paying that if it is served properly. I think this hotel has amazing potential and if the management keep listening they will easily have one of the best hotels in London in this category. Well done on the achievements so far - impressive for London!",4,2014,09,06
115,Great Location,"This hotel is down a side street and a great central location, especially for Covent Garden and The British Museum.We walked easily to Oxford Street, or the river.
Lovely rooms, nice quality linen and soaps etc. Staff were friendly and helpful and although we only stayed one night, we felt like we were on holiday. Fantastic art shop opposite too. We also ate in the Turkish restaurant opposite the end of the road which was great value, and buzzing.",5,2014,09,04
115,Lovely classic hotel,"Beautiful classic English hotel located in central location to shops, restaurants and the theatre district. Room was adequate size and very clean & comfortable. We had the buffet breakfast each morning which was of a high standard. Highly recommend this hotel",4,2014,09,03
115,Golden experience!,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at The Bloomsbury on the occasion of our Golden Wedding Anniversary and what a great experience it was.  They kindly upgraded our room and it was superb, along with the standard of service.  We were treated like royalty and everyone was delightfully friendly and helpful.  We couldn't have asked for more.  The hotel was well placed for theatre land, British museum, sights and was very close to a tube station, so getting about was easy.  We must mention the 'Full English' breakfast - it was the best we have ever had!  Not only was it freshly cooked, well served and plentiful, the buffet selection also made it very hard to know what to choose.   Great value.  Overall, our Bloomsbury experience was just the icing on the cake for a landmark occasion in our lives.  Just wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy all the other amenities - but we hope to return very soon.",5,2014,09,03
115,Bloomsbury Hotel stay,"A modern hotel of old world character, impecable customer service, friendly, accommodating and comfortable.  Rooms were spotless, comfortable and welcoming.  Tea/coffee facilities in the room (real coffee - Nespresso machine).  Quiet and relaxing stay and no complaints.  Location is good and plenty of restaurants for eating out.
Our group would recommend a stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel, Great Russell Street, to any traveller who enjoys their comfort.  A little bit on the pricey side at just under £800.00 for two rooms without breakfast (I think they could improve on this somewhat).
Overall a very satisfying visit to London central.",4,2014,09,03
115,Lovely hotel,"Great Rusell Street might not be much to look at, it's only minutes from Tottenham Court Road and bustling Soho, but once inside The Bloomsbury Hotel guests are transported to an oasis of quiet calm, good taste and luxury.  We were welcomed with a complimentary seasonal drink as we waited to check in and all staff we encountered were polite, friendly and very efficient.  We'd requested a quiet room away from the lifts and were delighted to find we'd been given a double upgrade to a stuio suite on the 4th floor.  The room and bathroom were lovely and I wished we were staying for more than one night.  The bed was huge and comfortable, ensuring a very good night's sleep.  I loved the big bathroom with its double sinks, high quality aromatherapy toilettries, walk-in shower, a fabulous roll top bath, and flat screen tv. We were impressed with the wide choice on offer at breakfast - all dietry requirements were catered for and everything was nicely presented and tasty.  Papers were available we were left to eat and read at our leisure.  Again, the staff were extremely effecient and professional, and were especially attentive to children and gave them colouring books to occupy them at the table.  
I would definitely stay there again as it's ideally located for all West End shopping, theatres and restaurants.",5,2014,09,03
115,Absolutely Stunning Hotel,"I enjoyed an overnight stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel with my wife on Friday 29th August as we were in town to see a show at The Adelphi Theatre (The Bodyguard - Musical).

We arrived mid-afternoon to be greeted at the front door by the concierge, and were checked in and in our room (305) within a couple of minutes - great service.

The room was excellent - it had everything we needed and then some. Coffee / tea / hot chocolate facilities, a minibar, ironing board and iron, hairdryer, and even a dressing gown & slippers :-). The beds themselves were very comfortable and I had a very good night's sleep. We got no noise in the room from people passing (or the elevators, as were were a good distance away).

We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel, but did have a couple of cocktails in the bar when we returned after the show - again, excellent.

I would 100% stay here again. Faultless.",5,2014,09,03
115,"Amazing hotel, reception staff are amazing","Amazing hotel, reception staff are amazing very helpful. There is one a man who helps with our events on the weekend that knows exactly how we like things and at what time. he is proactive and always wants to help thank you",5,2014,09,02
115,2nd visit - great hotel,"My 2nd visit to this hotel & it's just as nice. Came as staying overnight as a birthday treat for my partner to see Mama Mia!
Hotel is lovely, very clean and tidy. Bed in room is so comfortable. Had the best nights sleep in ages. Breakfast was lovely, plenty of choice and staff very helpful and friendly.
Location is great too with everything easy to get to from this hotel.
Definitely return when coming to London.",5,2014,09,01
115,Loved this place!,"This was our first visit to London and were overwhelmed by the size of London when selecting location of hotel. We loved this hotel's location, close to Covent Garden, Oxford Street and tube station. The Bloomsbury felt like a haven the moment we walked in. Our room was modern, clean and very comfortable. Great complimentary wifi was so welcomed. We will definitely return and have recommended to many friends already!",5,2014,09,01
115,Best place to stay in London,"We stayed for a week and everything was perfect.  The hotel is well located for  sightseeing, theater and restaurants. We walked directly to places we wanted to visit or to the Tottenham Court Tube station, which is close by.  The staff is very friendly and knew us right away.  The Concierge staff, especially Gary, made many reservations and recommendations for us and everyone was spot on.  I highly recommend the Bloomsbury Hotel.",5,2014,09,01
115,Lovely surprise.,"I had no idea that my husband had booked us a night's stay for my birthday. The staff were fabulous upon arrival and for the whole stay. I couldn't fault the service, and my husband even had them keeping more suprises from me. They all went above and beyond what I would expect. Very comfortable bed, which is a bonus as we both suffer with back pain. The only thing I can say is that we weren't informed to put the key in the door slot to use appliances. This was resolved. Lovely bar, with a fabulous Joel working that evening. Mario was the other very cheerful staff member working on the door. Thank you all!",5,2014,09,01
115,"Great service, excellent location!","Wonderful place to stay, close to London's actions and activities, great breakfast (not included, but worth ordering it the night before), nice-sized clean rooms, twice a day service.
We enjoyed, we definitely recommend!",5,2014,09,01
115,Another amazing stay at The Bloomsbury,"My husband and I managed to get a great price on a suite for our anniversary weekend. Everything from check in to check out was pleasant. Our room 521 was a beautiful large suite with three windows one looking out to the front of the hotel which was nice, the bed was so comfortable and huge, we didn't want to leave the room ! Roll top bath in the biggest bathroom I've ever seen which even had a TV and separate shower. Complimentary water which was nice and nightly turndown service with yummy chocolates! We were also left a lovely cake and card for our anniversary which was a lovely touch. What I love the most about the hotel is the staff are so polite and helpful, nothing is too much trouble and they actually seem to be interested in speaking to their guests. Particularly loved the Landseer bar, once again fabulous attentive staff and lovely ambience. We also had a meal in the hotel restaurant this time and I can't believe how quiet it was as the food was delicious! Very high quality and cooked to perfection. We have both decided that The Bloomsbury make the best full English breakfast that we've ever had at a hotel too, that was in the restaurant and in our room, piping hot and fresh both times. We will definitely be returning to stay the next time we are in London.  ",5,2014,08,31
115,Blooming Lovely!,"We stayed at this hotel for one night to celebrate my husband's birthday.I had emailed the hotel the night before to tell them this.On checking in the receptionist immediately said ""Happy Birthday"" when my husband mentioned his name......lovely welcoming touch.We had hot towels to clean our hands and a refreshing drink while we checked in.The best  friendly check in I've ever had,even better than Singapore hotels!

Our room was a superior room,smallish but beautifully decorated.The bathroom was very small but it did have a bath in.The room came with a very comfortable king sized bed with crisp bedlinen.
That day a  card and a cake were delivered to the room from the hotel for my husband....Nice touch.

We had cocktails in the bar and we found the barman was very friendly and there was a nice chilled atmosphere.
Breakfast was extensive and delicious and I couldn't fault it.Anything you could possibly want was available.Once again the staff were very helpful and friendly.
A fantastic friendly hotel in a superb location ,walkable to the British Museum, Theatres, Oxford Street/ Libertys ,Covent Garden and The British Museum.The Tube station is very near, just around the corner.

I would definitely recommend this hotel and it is now my favourite hotel in London and  hopefullyI will return soon.",5,2014,08,31
115,A luxurious night's accommodation,"Ambassador's Bloomsbury provided a welcome respite at the end of long day's travel. The reception staff were welcoming and assisted us to settle in as well as book our transport to Heathrow airport the next morning. Our late night room service was tasty, prompt and reasonably priced and presented. The accommodations were of an excellent standard and the bed was very comfortable. We would encourage everyone to avail themselves of this excellent hotel's services.",5,2014,08,31
115,Nice place for relax,I had just one night in the hotel. I've been with my boyfriend for special occasion and to chill out a little bit. Everything was nice and magical for us.We had a very great and warm welcoming.. we had lunch in the restaurant and the staff was very attentive and very friendly.. the food it was great. We were thinking to do an afternoon tea but we end up to the room because to tired and then we went to have an aperitif at the bar before dinner... the lady at the bar was very nice and took care of us very well.  We really enjoyed everything.We will be back for sure we want to try the afternoon tea as well that we miss that time.. and we will be back for dine as well... thank you very much for the great service.,5,2014,08,30
115,Nice hotel for business and pleasure.,Great position and very friendly and helpful staff. Would recommend both for business and pleasure. Bathrooms a bit small with a tiny sink and no place for toiletries. A few drawers would also be useful.  Otherwise amenities great.  ,5,2014,08,30
115,Speachless!,"We went last month. Because of our busy jobs we were anticipating our 3rd anniversary and looked for a relaxing and intimate location just for a short week end.
Good welcoming. The blonde (french?) receptionist was very nice and attentive. They proposed to take our luggage while having a drink and lunch in the restaurant. We found our luggage and room service just ready when, exhausted, we got back to our room. Really nice.
Maybe a quiet week but the reataurant was empty for a sunday lunch.
Only three couples dining. The atmosphere is gorgeous.
We didn't know that restaurant 
Usually you would expect a very easy restaurant in a hotel, with a very easy menu.
Actually... everything was great.
I love wooden floors and walls all around.
Dishes are very simple, yet tasty.
The quality of the food was mentionable for sure.
We had a nice walk in the afternoon and when back to our room, everything was ready for the night.
I didn't expect find our room ready for the night.
Really nice touch. I think the dinner was at a high level. Maybe because of the nice, discrete light, ir maybe because of the attentive service of the very young waiter serving us.
I usually don't eat a lot for breakfast.
Shame because the buffet was huge.
I can't judge the food but the presentation was amongst the best ever seen.
My partner had half of the buffet and a strange green healthy juice.
Her eyes where shining. I can't figure out how exaclty they could hear us talking about our anniversary but we have been given a big chocolate cake with a candle. She was about to cry and this will genuinely pay me back.
Well done.
I can't promise to come back next year to stay, but definitely soon to dine.",5,2014,08,29
115,Wonderful stay and wonderful staff,"My daughter and I stayed at The Bloomsbury for a week, and enjoyed every moment.  Great location and easy access to all the sites.  Staff was amazing and always went above and beyond to make our stay memorable.  The bar and restaurant staff were pleasant and enjoyable to chat with.   The room was very comfortable and clean.  The hotel is well maintained with the most lovely scented candles throughout.  I even purchased some of the candles to bring the memory back home.  We highly recommend this hotel and cannot wait until our next stay at The Bloomsbury.  Cheers!",5,2014,08,29
115,Amazing,I have visited a restaurant at the Bloomsbury hotel and it was amazing. The Restaurant staff was very professional and knowledgeable. Marta was an amazing host she made our day with her amazing approach and professionalism. I would always reccomend Bloomsbury hotel and complement its staff. Great job Marta!!,5,2014,08,29
115,A wonderful stay,"As a surprise for my wife's birthday, I booked a night at the Bloomsbury. Upon arrival, the staff could not be more helpful. Our room was wonderful and equipped with everything you would need. I asked the concierge if he could arrange a taxi for me to take us to Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club and he (Mario) even asked the cab driver not to mention where we were going so as not to spoil the surprise. The decor throughout the hotel is stunning, especially the bar where we had drinks served by Joel, the friendliest bartender you could meet. The location is ideal as it is a three minute walk from Tottenham Court Road tube station. I strongly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again.",5,2014,08,29
115,Wonderful stay in a great location,"A 3 night stay meeting family and friends in London, great hotel, lovely fresh juice when checking in, staff superb they could not be help more, nothing was a problem. Breakfast was a delight, a fantastically wide selection of a very high standard, we went for the full English option, the Japanese breakfast was included in this option, well worth a try. Cocktails in the Landseer bar..another delight. The whole hotel was immaculately maintained, our room was always thoroughly clean and tidy. To name one member of staff would not be fair to the other members of the team, so a very big thank you to them all.
Room size was the only issue, it was quite a squeeze, I left my clothes in my case so my wife could unpack hers, not very good, the only negative.
Would we stay again....yes we would, in a bigger room though!",4,2014,08,28
115,Excellent Hotel,I stayed at this wonderful hotel for three days at the mid to end of August and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The service was wonderful.  The hotel room was clean and the bed comfortable.  I paid for breakfast in advance and was happy I did so since the buffet was very nice and the food excellent.  I was happy with the location of the hotel and its proximity to the National Gallery which was about a ten to fifteen minute walk.  I had no negative experiences with this hotel and found that I got more than I paid for.   The next time I'm back in London I'll be sure to stay at this hotel again.  Cheers.,5,2014,08,28
115,Quaint hotel in the heart of London,"This hotel has easy access to Oxford street and other famous shopping areas.  The best part of it is that it feels very cosy and a place you look forward to getting back to once you are worn out from walking. 
It has a neat restaurant in it and a nice reception hall with flavored water for the thirsty.
I found the rooms a bit snug, but one could say it only adds to the cosy feel of the place. 
Service is rendered with a smile and they do their best to accommodate one's requests. 
I'd definitely return.",3,2014,08,27
115,Great Hotel,"we have just spent a few days at this lovely hotel - there is nothing I could complain about, the staff very friendly and always smiling the room beautifully clean and the full Engilish breakfast is excellent as I said there is nothing I could complain about - if your looking for a first class hotel in London give it a try you wont regret it.",5,2014,08,26
115,Had the best welcome ever,"Coming with our young daughter (only 7 month old) I didn't to be that welcomed.
The receptonist did their best to give us a larger room to be able to add a cot to it.
They've been efficient and positive during the whole process.

The room was nice and confortable.
The bathroom clean and spacious. 

I wish I could say that from all my experiences :)",5,2014,08,26
115,Excellent central London hotel,"After our long journey (2hour train ride so that was not too bad) we received a warm welcome by Joelle from reception. It's great to arrive in a hotel like this. Thanks! Our room was nice, big enough for the two of us. (hey, it's central London, what do you expect? A ballroom?) Very comfy bed, great shower and good airconditioning. Bonus: the window could be opened just a little bit. (we like fresh air) 

It's great to relax in the bar after a long day and evening, the staff in the bar are awesome. Thanks Joel and Kabir!

It's refreshing to see a hotel like this in central London (we've seen a few..), very decent service and decent price!",5,2014,08,26
115,Charming and stylish with excelent service,"This charming hotel and it's ever so friendly staff really took me by surprise! Maybe because I hadn't done much research, and therefore didn't know what to expect, but I couldn't stop smiling during our stay. They even picked up I had birthday, and delivered a birthday card to our room! The room was a bit on the small side, but it was clean and very smart decored. PS! Do not miss breakfast! Best hotel excperience in London, and it's been quite a few...",5,2014,08,25
115,Podge747,"This is a great, reasonably priced and perfectly located hotel for the London visitor.  The rooms are a good size for a city hotel. Comfy beds and well appointed bathroom. Quiet at night.  Delightful bar and restaurant.  We only partook of the hearty full English breakfast which was excellent (so you can skip lunch!).  The barman and the doorman were particularly friendly and helpful.  The hotel is located within very short walk of British Museum, Oxford St, Soho,Trafalgar Sq and the theater district but all of London's many attractions on both banks of the Thames are readily accessible on foot from this hotel.   A great place to stay!",4,2014,08,24
115,Could not have picked a better hotel...,"We had the pleasure of staying at this lovely hotel in early August.  From the moment we we welcomed to check out, we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel.  The rooms were very well appointed, the concierge and staff were extremely helpful, and the breakfast outstanding.  The hotel is a short walk to the British Museum and the HOHO bus.  Would stay there again in a heartbeat!",5,2014,08,23
115,Def worth a stay,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights for our wedding anniversary. We entered the hotel to a wonderful aroma of burning candles. The staff greeted us with warmth and friendliness and gave us a glass of fresh juice whilst we checked in. The hotel was stylish, perfectly located for the hub of the London sights and shopping. We had an anniversary cake and card delivered to our room, compliments of the staff of the hotel, which was a great personal touch. We dined on the terrace and the food was delicious and staff very attentive, polite and friendly. Worth a visit to the cocktail bar to finish off your evening with the jolly barman!  We will definitely revisit and recommend it to anyone visiting the big city.",5,2014,08,22
115,"Very nice hotel, excellent staff.","My wife and I spent 3 nights at the Bloomsbury and were very impressed. The room was a nice size, the bathroom was great and all was very clean. All of the staff we dealt with were very friendly and attentive. The hotel is in a great location for London sites, theatre and shopping.",5,2014,08,22
115,Worth the money,I visited the bloomsbury for the night with my wife and I have to say I was not disappointed the staff were quick to assist and answer any queries. The rooms were 1st class we had a standard double it looked like a suite. The bar in the basement was quite discreet with the low lights and chilled ambience. And the full english breakfast was good quality next time iam in London I will be returning to the bloomsbury and to top it off the price was good considering it was in central London compared to hotels for more money for a lot less quality.,4,2014,08,21
115,Excellent Hotel,"Although we only stayed one night the experience was first class and I've no doubt we will return.
Staff are welcoming, helpful and friendly. The choice for breakfast was varied beautifully cooked and presented. Our room was spacious, well appointed and very comfortable. The hotel is ideally placed for access to the West End and Oxford Street. You weren't hurried out in the morning, which was really nice. In summary, "" a really pleasant experience.""",5,2014,08,21
115,"A hidden gem , to which I'm so glad I found","Just recently I lost both my parents to cancer , and recently since my brother in law . I have taken a little time of for reflection and to relax and chill . Whilst walking down from totenham court road I noticed down one street a particular inviting hotel , as I walked past the smell of beautiful scented perfume and a warm vibe I thought I'll pop in have a little look . A few weeks have pasted since then and I think I have stayed at this hotel 5 or six times . What's different about the bloomsbury is the sense of family welcome and feel to it , the stunning traditional decor and well maintained hotel . On arrival I noted that I would like. DVD player in my room , this was no problem and immediately sought . From requests such as fruit in the room or cereals and yoghurt at obscure times of day. Nothing is a problem . The staff are so cheerful all the time especially one of housekeeping who does evening turndown , wish I could remember her name , beautiful smile . The breakfast s included in my rate have been second to none and have always been hot and tasty . Even the Danishes and toast has been warm ( not an easy feet when feeding such a big hotel with as many floors . So thank you bloomsbury , you are now officially my second home and are in my heart , from the Guys at reception, right through to concierge , housekeeping and kitchen and maintenance , if you are in the area , there is really no other place quite like it , as a chef having working in big hotels and restaurants myself , I kinda know what works ,,let me tell you this place does . See you soon guys and many thanks :)",5,2014,08,21
115,"Very charming, great location",The hotel was a couple of blocks from the Undergroud and the British Museum. It was a pleasure to return every evening to the welcoming staff and charming hotel. The rooms were a little small but very attractive and very well appointed.  We will definitely return.,5,2014,08,21
115,Excellent London Hotel,First rate central London Hotel with excellent facilities. Staff extremely helpful and rooms well-appointed and well maintained. Would highly recommend. Will definitely use again if travelling to London.,5,2014,08,20
115,Just Great!,"Just got back from a 4 night stay and cannot say enough. From the moment you arrive the staff cannot be more helpful. The lobby is like entering the living room of an old friend, welcoming and inviting. The design and attention to detail did not go unnoticed. The rooms are large well-appointed and the beds are extremely comfortable. The breakfast was quite good but I particularly like the Juicery, try the London Greens and the Hollywood are both fantastic!",5,2014,08,19
115,Excellant Hotel 10/10!!!,"We stayed at The Bloomsbury for the Saturday night and absolutley loved it. I travelled with my fiance and our toddler (17 months old) and was made to feel so welcomed.  I upgraded our room to a superior room and when we arrived it had a lovely wooden cot with a Johnsons pack of essential baby items and a teddy with a Bloomsbury hotel jumper on, my little boy loved it and had a wonderful nights sleep.  Our room was very stylish and comfortable. We had breakfast on the Sunday morning and it was excellant !! again the staff made us welcomed and gave our toddler a new pack of Peppa Pigs books which he loved!!  I definitley recommend this hotel and i am very glad i found this little gem and will definitley return in the future.",5,2014,08,19
115,Best place to stay.,"This is the second time that we have stayed here, and again everything was great, can't recommend it enough, great . The service was great from when we arrived to when we left and very personalised,  we will be back again.",5,2014,08,19
115,A hotel worthy of a special mention...,"We arrived from Hong Kong @ 0830 after a 12.5 hour flight and whilst we were not scheduled to Check-in until 1400 that afternoon, the Reservations Staff did a marvellous job of assessing the hotels room availability so we could check in early. Thanks to them we had a fantastic shower  after which we relaxed & generally ""got our bearings"" before we stepped out of the hotel. Our room was well appointed as would be expected of a hotel of this calibre; However, the cleanliness, attention to detail and overall presentation of our room by the Housekeeping Staff couldn't be faulted. Breakfast in the mornings in the Restaurant was very well presented, balanced, with a wholesome high quality. The Table Staff were efficient, attentive and very courteous - well led by a Supervisor who knows her operation intimately. It was a pleasure to go to breakfast each morning!
 
However, special mention must go to the member of Housekeeping who attended to our room. I mistakenly left my wallet in our room and when I realised during the day where it was, I was naturally concerned for its integrity as it had over £160, credit card & drivers licence in it. When I returned to our room the wallet was carefully placed under my pillow with a corner sticking out to highlight its presence. Not a single item had been touched - it was completely intact. 
 
Given all the ""bad news"" on TV's, in newspapers and on the radios across the world, our conditioning is such that we expect to be wronged - particularly when any amount of money will make life a little easier. I also know 5 star hotels across the world expect their employees to demonstrate the highest levels of honesty as a reflection of the hotels values.
 
The honesty, integrity and values demonstrated by this special person are obvious to themselves - but I believe it's very important the Bloomsbury Management is aware of this special person and their contribution to restoring our belief that there are decent, honest & trustworthy people amongst us.",5,2014,08,18
115,Perfect for a weekend,"Perfect for a weekend trip with your love. Everything was good, except for the small room. Excellent breakfast and good bed. The location aone block from New Oxford Street and to tube station Totemham Court",5,2014,08,18
115,Great place to stay!,"My wife and I, along with another couple, spent three nights at this hotel while visiting London. While we were out and about the majority of the time, we found the hotel a wonderful haven. The room was very nice, but the staff is what stands out. From the porters to the concierge to the front desk personnel to the restaurant staff, they were all extremely helpful, friendly, and courteous. The hotel is located very close to the British Museum and within easy walking distance of Trafalgar Square, Convent Gardens, and many other London attractions.",5,2014,08,18
115,Lovely central hotel with a friendly feel,"I came for a 1 Night stay with my 11 year old daughter, as part of a theatre night treat!
The double room was a good size and equipped well, with nice coffees/machine and a separate tea tray, big TV plus iPod speaker etc. 
Great central location. Lovely friendly staff. Quiet in hotel room/area. 
We had breakfast in bed - wow huge breakfasts and nice selection! 
Nice in-bathroom room toiletry range too.
My only negative comment - and this may simply be for my particular room - would be the sink in the bathroom was tiny and the central set tap meant you couldn't wash your face well without soaking the floor or banging yourself - it was really a hand basin nothing more. 
But, that aside the room itself had lovely decor and this is a well recommended central London hotel!",5,2014,08,17
115,Perfect location,"We spent a couple of nights at this hotel and were very impressed. Our room was quiet, clean, comfortable and tastefully decorated. The staff at the front desk were very efficient but also very welcoming. Lovely scents floated around the corridors and there are some amazing books lying around in the entrance hall. We had breakfast in the hotel on both mornings, a wonderful selection for all. A little disappointed with the porridge but everything else was delicious. The location of this hotel is perfect. Directly opposite is L.Cornelissen & Son, the most tantalising art shop with all sorts of temptations. Within a few minutes you can get to The British Museum, Oxford Street, Convent Garden, the theatres and much, much more. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,08,17
115,"Good hotel, accommodating staff","We stayed here overnight after seeing a show, the hotel is ideally located for the a Westend.

The staff were welcoming on arrival and very polite.

The downside is that the room was very small for a superior room, but it was clean and had everything you would need.

Breakfast was good with a variety of choice and again efficient staff",3,2014,08,17
115,A Lovely Hotel and Very Friendly Staff,"We stayed at this hotel on the 15th August and was very impressed. Our room was amazing and staff were so very friendly, could not do enough for us. Brian the concierge was very welcoming with a great knowledge of the area. Giles was brilliant in the Bar, he kept the Bar area clean at all times and he did fantastic cocktails. Louise was also very friendly and so helpful. When we arrived in the afternoon we saw some people having afternoon tea and the cakes looked absolutely mouth watering.So pleased with our experience, would definitely recommend this to anyone an cannot wait to return, will difficultly be having afternoon tea soon. Thank you to ALL the staff for making our stay so lovely.",5,2014,08,16
115,Fab Hotel!!!,"Love this hotel have stayed their twice in the past few months and my second visit was just as great as my first. From the moment you arrive you are made to feel so welcome from the concierge`s at the door to the lovely receptionists checking you in, during our stay not once did we meet a staff member who was not smiling and extremely helpful. The rooms are on the small side but beautifully furnished and everything you need or want, also the most important aspects beautifully clean, comfy beds and pillows. My second stay was for our Anniversary and minutes after checking into our room there was a knock on the door and the hotel had sent up a beautiful slate platter wrapped up really prettily with gorgeous fruit and pastries also an Anniversary card such a lovely surprise and so unexpected a really nice gesture.
Whilst I appreciate there are a lot of great hotels in London now I have found this one I would not hesitate to come back to this hotel any time I visit London in the future and would highly recommend it as was done to us. A little haven in the heart of a big City!!!!!",5,2014,08,16
115,Perfect Experience!,"Our hotel room was lovely as well as comfortable. The hotel itself not only looked elegant but also smelled amazing! The breakfast far exceeded expectations.  However, the best part of the Bloomsbury, is its staff.  Brian, the concierge, made recommendations, drew countless maps and inquired each day about our adventures.  His friendly, professional, caring attention really made us feel cared for.  The lobby staff and restaurant staff were all so friendly and helpful!  I wouldn't dream of coming to London and staying anywhere else.",5,2014,08,15
115,Wonderful staff and rooms,"I stayed two nights 50/50 social and business. The whole experience was perfect in every respect. The staff are superbly trained and managed and the rooms are extremely well thought out - right down to the heated bathroom floors. I had breakfast and a business lunch twice and both were professionally managed. I usually avoid hotel breakfasts because I find the crowded industrial fast-feeding systems uncomfortable, but this was pleasantly different. 

It would be very difficult to find a better hotel, with more welcoming and efficient staff, in any location in London. I travel extensively for business and spend many (too many) nights in hotels but I would very happily return to the Bloomsbury.",5,2014,08,15
115,Perfect hotel,"Recently spent 3 nights at The Bloomsbury.  From the moment we arrived we had a first class stay.  
The staff were polite and friendly and made our stay even more enjoyable.   The hotel is well situated for Theatreland, shopping and sight-seeing.  The surrounding area has many good cafés bars and restaurants to suit all tastes.

The breakfast at The Bloomsbury is fantastic.  A good start to anyone's day!  Rooms were clean and well-appointed apart from a lack of drawer-space.  The lighting was a little dowdy in the rooms for our taste too but I am 'nit picking' now.   Overall a lovely break in a lovely hotel.  I would love to return.",5,2014,08,14
115,"London Trip,","We were lucky enough to win two nights in London and had a choice of three hotels.
We were so happy we picked The Bloomsbury Hotel,
Location, very pleasant staff, and a lovely room. 
It was our first time in London, so we needed some help, Underground etc
Overall a beautiful hotel.",5,2014,08,13
115,Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon Tea at the Bloomsbury Hotel was a great experience. Very pleasant environment, and very courteous staff made our afternoon very relaxing and enjoyable. The Chef produced outstanding sandwiches, cakes, and superb scones complimented with cream and quality jam. The three of us were impressed with the quality of the Coffee, Earl Grey Tea and English Breakfast. We would most definitely visit again and strongly recommend. Rick.",5,2014,08,12
115,Very accomidating,I recently stayed at the The Bloomsbury Hotel and had a lovely time. I arrived to London at 6:30 am on the red-eye and got to the hotel around 7:30. I had called for an early check in and the found a room for me when I got there. The first night I came back they had placed a fruit basket in the room for me. The staff always had a smile on their faces and were very pleasant in the mornings. The only suggestion I would give is to put a clock in the room so I didn't have to check my phone all the time.,5,2014,08,12
115,A lovely hotel with fantastic staff!,"We have just returned from a two night stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel in London.  This is a lovely, quiet and relaxed hotel, situated just off Tottenham Court Road on Great Russell Street. The hotel is very nicely furnished and is spotlessly clean. Bedrooms were small but very nicely appointed. The breakfast which was included in the price was beautiful.  We were all really impressed with the staff in the hotel.  They were all polite and very helpful. In fact, nothing was too much trouble for them and they went out of their way to ensure we had a lovely time.  It is these things that you remember and that make your stay that little bit extra special.  Tottenham Court Road tube station was just around the corner and there were also regular bus services. Covent Garden and Soho were a ten minute walk (if that!) and we also walked all the way to the South Bank so it is a very central base from which to explore London. We ate out on both evenings in the nearby Charlotte Street (5 minutes away) which had lots of lovely bars and restaurants and a lovely relaxed feel. This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel and I would most certainly recommend it to others. Thank you to everyone at The Bloomsbury Hotel for a lovely stay!",4,2014,08,11
115,"Great location, great staff and fab breakfast","Stayed over night for a weekend visit to London, it was fab the location us great he staff are so helpful and welcoming will definitely recommend thus hotel and be back again for sure! Close to Covent Garden and Oxford Street",5,2014,08,11
115,"Third time here, will be back next year!","This is the third time myself and my mam have stayed in ths hotel on our annual trip to London. We still love it. Had a deluxe room, level 6, was lovely.walk in shower was fantastic. Beds very comfy, plenty of room. Coffee nespresso machine was great. Thank you very much to Ben off the front desk who came up to our room when I rang to say I couldn't work it, much appreciated. Extra coffee and milk provided when requested. No noise at all, very quiet room. If anything the lighting is a bit dull, but very flattering, lol. Towelling robes are lovely, great quality. Concierge extremely helpful, very polite. Breakfast was gorgeous, the continental choice is lovely, fresh fruit was lush, veggie breakfast great although not too sure about the veggie sausage, was like deep fried potato. Great staff in the restaurant although at times bit to eager to take plates away. Given bottles of water on our checkout. We will be back next year.",5,2014,08,10
115,A haven from the bustle of the Capital,"Stayed recently for three days. This very comfortable and well appointed hotel is well located for West End theatres, and their pre- theatre dinner with a glass of wine included is excellent value. Afternoon teas are less good value, but too much for one person to eat, so share one ! Explore Nearby Tottenham Court Road if you are into Electricals & Teccy gadgets. The Staff are a real asset to this establishment, being both efficient and always very friendly. TC road tube is just around the corner. The building was designed by Architect Sir Edwin Lutyens of New Delhi/Castle Drogo/Thiepval WW1 monument, fame.",5,2014,08,10
115,"Great rooms, just don't leave any belongings","Hotel in a great location, on a street which is not horrendously ""London"" busy. 
Friendly check-in staff,  decor and comfy reception area.
Some lovely pubs and cafes in the vicinity.

Requested a room with kingsize bed which we were allocated. However, we also requested a high floor due to my sound phobia, which was not honoured, and our room was on the 2nd floor. The room was at the back of hotel. I'm sure this would be quiet, as it is away from the traffic, however,  be aware that the rear of the hotel is the service area, so we were treated to an early wake-up call by the binmen which is not ideal on a slightly hungover Saturday morning.  

Lots of finishing touches in the room, including Nespresso machine, complimentary mineral water, quality toiletries etc.
I loved it here, it had a very chilled atmosphere, classy but not stuffy.  

I would have given the hotel 5 stars..... however when I got home I realised I had left a travel pillow in the room. The following day I emailed the hotel and was told by housekeeping that nothing had been found in the room. It is the only place it would have been in, as it was not in my suitcase!!!   So now, this has left me with a trust issue with the hotel.  Otherwise, it would have been perfect.",4,2014,08,08
115,Excellent location and service,"I absolutely love hotels that welcome you with a lovely aroma and the Bloomsbury does not disappoint. The hotel is easily accessbile from London Euston and is perfectly located for most of London's key sights. Check-in was extremely efficient and the service from staff welcoming. The room was small but luxurious. We did not use any of the hotel's facilities, including the restaurant but can highly recommend the hotel for its location, service and the quality of its rooms.",4,2014,08,07
115,Afternoon tea,"We had one of the best afternoon tea at the ritz a few weeks ago for my mum birthday and last week we had afternoon tea at this hotel and I can tell you that the quality of the tea was as good as the ritz or even better. The scones were soft and moist, still warm inside and the other little cakes were as good. We will definitely come back.",5,2014,08,07
115,An excellent visit,"Every year we return and every year we have a lovely visit.  Front of house staff are fantastic.  Room was a good size for just a standard room.  Breakfast was delicious and of a very high standard. Our only critisism would be the behind the scenes staffing, due to the fact that each day we needed to ask for another tea bag and packet of biscuits.  Thank you for your superb hospitality. ",5,2014,08,07
115,Classy Hotel with a great location,"Pros:

-High standards of interior
-Super effective airco
-Great bed and pillows
-Robe & slippers provide as standard (don't take these for granted in UK)
-Ironing in the room works wonders
-Magazines & quality freebies
-Top notch concierge(s) (Great restaurants Abdul, thank you!)
-Small but well equipped gym
-Coffee machine in the room
-Iphone dock in the room

Cons:

-Grumpy amd unprofessional breakfast staff working under Maria, only one to smile was the asian young lady who almost made us feel welcome (spend an hour learning customer service from the concierges)
-Room views less than impressive into office next door
-Opening the closet door hiding minibar took dynamite and crowbar
-Once open, you couldn't put any of your own drinks inside the fridge. (e.g. cold drinking water would have been nice)",4,2014,08,06
115,Wonderful service!,We spent 5 days at the Bloomsbury in July.  The concierge staff was wonderful and helped us set up a private visit to our ancestral manor.  They went above and beyond at every step.  We had given up hope of being able to visit the manor and this really made our trip.  We are forever thankful to them.  Every member of the hotel staff was exemplary and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.,5,2014,08,06
115,Great hotel at great location,"It is our first time staying at this hotel which has a very spacious lobby and the brown bricks exterior is rustic but at the same time elegant. The rooms are cozy and comfortable and the bed and pillows are comfy too.
The concierge Paolo was very helpful and assisted us a lot
The location of this hotel is very centralised and is just walking distance to Covent garden and oxford street. 
There is also a 24 hours cafe diagonally in front of the hotel entrance.",4,2014,08,05
115,an accidental find but what a treasure,"This hotel came up on a site (can't remember which one) when looking for somewhere to stay for 1 night when up in town to see a show at the Apollo for my birthday. Got the most amazing deal on 1 night with breakfast - couldn't believe how fabulous the hotel was when we turned up - it was so plush and welcoming and so totally gorgeous. The room was a delight - spotlessly clean, really beautifully furnished with a huge bed that was so comfy we almost missed breakfast! We had a cocktail each before bed and I can highly recommend the oriental mojito. If I had any minor niggles, it would be that the water pressure in the above bath shower wasn't great (but it was adequate) and the hot breakfast buffet only had scrambled eggs which looked a little tired. I blissed out on the delicious Danish, but my hubby was disappointed not to have a fried egg with his traditional English. I'm sure we could have asked for a fried egg and the team would have been more than happy to help, but we were in a hurry, so ... I would love to return for a longer stay - I'll keep an eye out for offers - and would recommend for comfort, welcome and location",5,2014,08,05
115,nice hotel,"we stayed to nights for theater visit and anniversary, very good hotel at a good price. staff very friendly and helpful restaurant staff especially good. breakfast was good all you can eat, lunch was good but could do with a bit more choice although plenty of choice outside hotel.",4,2014,08,05
115,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel in the center of London. Shopping on short distance. Fantastic restaurants close by. We stay in this hotel every time we visit London for Business or for fun. Rooms are not big, but clean and large enough to accommodate 2 people.",5,2014,08,05
115,Disappointment,"After reading so many good comments, i must admit i was somehow disappointed by this hotel.
It's a quite charming, typically bristish old-fashioned hotel rather centrally situated near Soho . This what concerns the building and the general atmosphere.
We made a reservation for a double bedroom with 2 beds. The room was dark ,very old-fashioned and small. Moreover there was a disagreeable smell in it , which was impossible to make disappear as it's not possible to open the window properly.
The bathroom was very small as well.
I found breakfast expensive considering the quality of it. This hotel is nothing compared to the K+K where i stayed at a previous stay. Less central, but very nearby a tube station, less expensive and of much better quality.",3,2014,08,05
115,"""Great location""","We were a group of 5 adults and 2 children on holidays in London. This was our first time visiting the city and stayed for 3 nights. The key location of the hotel and it's courteous staff was most memorable.  We were allowed early check-in without hassle. The rooms were of average size but clean and without odors. The area of the hotel was quiet and safe at night.  Noise level was minimum.  The breakfast that came with the package was fantastic.   The walk to the British museum was less than 10 minutes down Great Russell St.  Trafalgar Square was a 20 minute leisurely walk with kids. SoHo was minutes away and catching a West End show was not a problem. Restaurants, convenience stores, and currency changers were plenty.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2014,08,05
115,great London hotel,"Just had 3 nights at this wonderful hotel.  Always makes a difference when you arrive at a hotel and they let you check in early.  The staff were really friendly in all aspects from reception to housekeeping to breakfast staff.  Joel was especially friendly in the bar - a great bartender.  Ideal location for most of West End - Soho, Oxford St, British Museum etc.  Would definitely recommend it and return next time",5,2014,08,03
115,Very nice hotel,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury hotel for two nights and everything was just perfect. The location was good, almost next to the British Museum. The room was not big, but easily large enough to accomodate two people. And most importantly everything was nice and clean, which is not always the case with London hotels. 

The staff was friendly and helped us in everything we needed. I would gladly stay here again.",5,2014,08,02
115,Always a wonderful stay.,"Stayed in the hotel over two consecutive weekends while in London to see our son. This is the third time we've stayed here and each time it's been a pleasure. The hotel staff are always lovely and friendly and make you feel so welcome.  We are always allowed to check in early and nothing is too much trouble. We asked for an upgrade the second weekend and were given a great room with the best bed we've slept in for a long time!! 
The bartender was so professional and we sat and chatted with him for a while on the Saturday evening.  Unfortunately I can't remember his name but he was a delight. The bar is such a relaxing place to unwind after a day in London. 
We stayed the first weekend with our other  son and his fiancé and they have said the next time they're in London they will be staying at the hotel. They were so impressed. 
Sorry it's taken so long to write a review but time seems to have gone so fast. 
Once again a great stay in a wonderful hotel. Can't recommend it highly enough.",5,2014,08,02
115,Perfect,Stayed for two nights and loved our stay. Staff were very polite and professional: offering us bottles of water as we checked out was a nice touch. Happy with room size (Hotel rooms in London aren't massive) and the amenities included were excellent.  We were seeing a stand up show in Soho so the location was excellent for that. Its right next to all the action: Oxford Street and Trafalgar Square for example all within walking distance. We never got the tube once. Fantastic stay and would visit again.,5,2014,08,01
115,Lovely hotel in a great location,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury for three nights. The staff were fabulous and very helpful. We arrived in London around 8 am (4:30 am in our jet lagged timezone) and they let us check in early which was amazing. 

We booked a Deluxe Queen, which I found to be on the smaller size and our view from the window was a brick wall two feet away. For the amount of money we paid to stay, we found this really disappointing. Our tv didn't work for the entire trip, even after reporting it, but it wasn't a huge problem for us. Other than that, the rooms were very clean and lovely. The bed was so comfortable!

We had a fabulous evening in the bar and had a wonderful meal. The bartender, Joel, was so professional and we had such a wonderful experience because of him. 

Overall, the hotel was lovely and we had a nice stay there. ",3,2014,07,31
115,beautiful,"arrived here and went to check in, lady on the desk was lovely, really good at her job and very welcoming. we got a upgrade and the room was lovely although a little smaller than we anticipated it was spotlessly clean and very smart. didnt have breakfast as had to leave early but will be back again soon. thanks to all. ",5,2014,07,30
115,"Great Facilities, Good locations, great service","It was my first time at this Hotel.
The location is very good, very close to tottenham tube station and well located if you want to visit museums, go shopping or go our for dinner.
The facilities are excellent, nice rooms, nice saloons and nice atmosphere.
Also the service is very good, from reception to restaurant they are very professional and very kind, always trying to help.
The breakfast is excellent with a nice choice and great quality food and there is free wi-fi at a very decent speed.
Above all a great choice in Central London.",5,2014,07,30
115,"Great Locations, lots of extras, good value for money","We stayed for one night in July with our American friends who were in London for the first time. I'm so glad this hotel gave our friends a great first impression.  The room was lovely with lots of touches, Nespresso coffee maker etc.  The staff we met were exceptionally helpful.  It's great to know of a good, reasonably priced hotel in heart of London.  We will recommend and return.  Thank you!",5,2014,07,29
115,Really lovely in every way.,"Have just returned from a one night stay & thought everything about the hotel was perfect...very welcoming & helpful staff, gorgeous & extremely comfortable reception area with books & newspapers (didn't want to leave!), very attractive & well equipped bedroom, great breakfast & beautiful smells all around the hotel. This hotel has thought of just about everything, it's our new ""favourite"" & we can't wait to return...",5,2014,07,27
115,The Bloomsbury...Putting the 'Great' in Great Russell Street!!,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is an absolute gem managed and run by diamonds! This was our first stay at the hotel and was extremely short, just one night, but in that short time we fell in love with the place, the location is perfect, the ambience is delightful and the attention given to the guest is second to none, a personal and very friendly attention that cant help but make you feel special. We always stay in the area on our visits to the theatre and to concerts, the West End, Covent Garden and Royal Festival Hall being so close to hand, we can't believe how we've managed to miss The Bloomsbury!!...needless to say, she is now our preferred hotel for future visits.",5,2014,07,25
115,Top notch!,"The Bloomsbury is a beautiful hotel. It is conveniently located to pubs, restaurants, and other attractions. We did not have a car, and did not need one. The building itself is very unassuming but when you enter the door it is amazing. Very beautiful décor. The bellman and the concierge helped us with directions to attractions and gave us recommendations for pubs and restaurants. The bellman advised us of a scheduled taxi strike and summoned a taxi for us before the strike so we would make it to the airport for our flight. All of the staff was very professional, yet warm and welcoming. Our rooms were wonderful! They were modern and spotless! The bed was so comfy. I highly recommend this hotel if you are traveling to London!",5,2014,07,24
115,A Pleasant stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel with a minor issue,"Spent 4 days with my partner at the Bloomsbury Hotel in July 2014. Overall we had a very good stay and found the staff to be friendly, pleasant and generally amenable.

We arrived early in the morning and as a GHA black member they let us check into our room early. The room, (a Deluxe) although nicely furnished was very small with no storage space. I asked if they had a room with a bit more space. They said they couldn't upgrade me as they didn't have a room for my entire stay, but they did, very kindly, find me a Deluxe room with a lot more space, which was much nicer. 

Unfortunately the next day, we had some plumbing issues: after running the shower for 30 seconds it was evident the water was not draining and it started to flood the bathroom. I reported it to the front desk and they said someone would come straight up to fix it. However when we got back to our room late in the evening it was evident that nobody had been to fix it and the following day we had to endure very short showers and a bit more mopping up the bathroom floor! Again reported it and this time they sent someone to fix the issue straight away.

Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was very good - if you book with the reception desk the day before you save over £5 per person.

Despite the shower issues, it was a good stay and I would go back.",4,2014,07,24
115,I can't rate this hotel highly enough!,"We will definitely be staying here for all our future London visits.

Excellent location, first street on the right after Tottenham court (get out at exit 3), gorgeously appointed rooms, very cool lobby but most of all FANTASTIC 5 Star service!! We have stayed in rooms that are triple the price of these and have never received such good service with a fresh juice and towels on arrival. The lady at reception is an absolute darling. Our first room didn't have a view (it was still a lovely room we just wanted a bit of a London view) and there were none in our category with views available that night but the very next day she moved us to a gorgeous room with a view and went out of her way to do so. I was sick during our stay and the late night room service lady made me a special lemon and honey tea for my cold despite it not being on the menu and recommended soups to help me feel better... Just all round stella staff that make you feel very welcome.

The Bloomsbury Hotel is in a super cool location in London, close to heaps of trendy spots - a must stay for every traveller - I can see this place moving up to a 5 star rating once they have a pool. ",5,2014,07,24
115,The Bloomsbury Hotel - Doyle Collection,"Great hotel and great staff.  Brian is a great concierge and the bellmen are uniquely helpful.  Luis is a gem and recent addition.  He even walked us toward our location to be sure we wouldn't get lost.  It's a long but pleasant walk down Charing Cross Road to Trafalgar Square, the Royal Horseguards, 10 Downing Street, Westminster Abbey and the Parliament.  Very convenient to some of the top plays and musicals.  Only two blocks from the British Museum.",5,2014,07,22
115,Hidden Gem in the Heart of London,"Wow, what a great hotel. Excellent location, excellent warm, friendly and accommodating staff. Short walk to a tube station, Soho and Covent Gardens about 10 minutes way. Once you walk inside the doors of the hotel, you are instantly greeted by a relaxed and calming atmosphere, set by wonderful scented candles.  We stayed with a group of 7 friends.  All of  our rooms were big, spacious and impeccable presented. Dessert plate from Head Chef Paul was a treat. Popcorn at 1am was just what we needed after a long day sightseeing.  Breakfast was excellent, well appointed buffet with plenty of variety of fruit, meats, pastries, juices with hot breakfast from the Kitchen. The late night bar staff were very helpful and attentive to our party  - not an easy job. I've stayed in some of the best hotels in the world for work and The Bloomsbury is by far my favorite.   
A must for anyone looking for a hotel in London. Congrats to Michael and his wonderful team. Looking forward to my next visit already…",5,2014,07,21
115,Great hotel at great location,"Stayed at The Bloomsbury Hotel late June 2014 and had a lovely stay. The staff were all very friendly. We got a very good and nice room that had all we needed. The hotel is on a street just behind Oxford Street close to the Tottenham Court Road tube station. The location is perfect. 
The hotel has a very calm and relaxing atmosphere and it was very quiet.
The room was modern and clean and the bathroom was also nice and clean.
We had no complaints.",5,2014,07,21
115,Excellent,Fantastic location and very accommodating staff. Perfect for Soho and Covent Garden with  rooms of a very high standard and impeccably presented. I don't think you could do better at this very reasonable price. Highly recommended - we wouldn't think twice about visiting again. ,5,2014,07,18
115,My favorite hotel.  Ever.,"I've stayed in many hotels, including many luxury hotels, and this is my favorite hotel ever.  We arrived here after originally having booked a less expensive hotel, but when we went to check into that hotel, I just thought it was too grim and industrial to stay in for a vacation in London that we'd long been looking forward to.  After looking at the reviews for the Bloomsbury Hotel, we arrived here, and couldn't have been happier.  

It's everything you'd want in a London hotel.  Beautiful, great location.  Heck, it even smells great.  The appointments are as nice, and the service is as good as any of the best hotels I've stayed at.  But it's the staff who really set the place apart.  They are completely wonderful -- genuinely nice and helpful, from the gentleman who took our bags at the door, to the lovely woman who booked us in, to the two concierges who took it upon themselves (bless them) to sort out a large snafu with our rental car. This is the kind of hotel you remember with great fondness, and come back to.  We certainly will.",5,2014,07,17
115,"Birthday party, dining and stay. Great place to stay. very helpful staff","We have planned our birthday party for our kids and the Head Chief-Sir Paul (very down to earth person) assisted us with all the menu and other arrangments. We are including our guest was very impressed with the selection of the menu, great tasting food, great venue (being in the center of London), room are clean and very helpful staff . The breakfast selection is also great.Our guess was also impressed that they wanted to arrange there party in the future also in the hotel . 
I would definitely well come back and stay, book an event in this hotel. Im completely satisfied with our stay, the venue, the food, excellent support of the staff especially the Head Chief-Sir Paul and Maria who have help us above and beyond of there Job.",5,2014,07,16
115,"All The Comforts of Home, if You Lived Like a King!","My wife and I spent 5 incredible days in London and on the recommendation of friends, stayed at The Bloomsbury Hotel.  There were so many wonderful details about this hotel, it's hard to know where to begin.  As we walked into the lobby after our trek from the airport via the Underground, there was a lovely aroma that filled the lobby and we were to discover much of the hotel, that came from scented candles that created an ambiance of feeling more like we were n a very elegant home than a hotel.  The hotel staff and concierge were professional and very helpful.  Our room had a king size bed and enough space to feel like we weren't cramped.  And the rooms were very quiet, although the area where the hotel is located was on a busy street.  A few hours after we arrived, there was a knock on the door and we were greeted with a tray of fresh fruit and desserts with a lovely note from the concierge welcoming us to London.  I can't say enough about hotel and their caring and helpful staff except that on the last night we were there, when we were reviewing our plans to have to get to the airport, the staff arranged to send up complementary coffee at 6:30 in the morning so we could at least be caffeinated before heading onto our next leg of our journey.  I am sure there are many wonderful hotels to stay at in London, but we felt incredibly fortunate to have stayed at The Bloomsbury which was so warm, welcoming and classy!",5,2014,07,15
115,"Amazing, beautiful, wonderful","We love staying here, the staff are so welcoming, friendly and helpful. The concierge can never do enough for you. Fantastic location right on Covent Garden, China Town, Oxford Street etc. Food is always delicious and the bar has a fantastic ambience and selection of drinks, always served by very friendly staff. Rooms are luxurious, very well equiped, comfortable and beautifully decorated. The bathroom has everything you need. This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Its amazing, we always feel so special when we stay there and very well looked after.",5,2014,07,14
115,Top notch hotel,"A perfect place to stay for that weekend away in London. Most places were within walking distance, even The Thames, about 20 mins. Our room was 609, that although at the back of the hotel overlooking another building, it was very well equipped and spotlessly clean. The bed was very comfortable and I loved the little extras like bed turning down service and chocolates. The bathroom was compact with little space to put things but it was adequate for our needs. Breakfast was served until 11.30 so it gave us the opportunity to have a lie in. Service of breakfast was a little slow but when it arrived it was delicious. We would certainly stay there again.",4,2014,07,14
115,VIP service,"Stayed here with my friend in May. We wanted somewhere in a good location so we could go out for a meal and drinks. Couldn't have been more convenient  literally 2 minute walk from tube station. On check in we were given hot towels to clean our hands and elderflower cordial.(The reception smelt amazing!) Our luggage was then delivered to our room. Our room was lovely comfortable bed, nice modern bathroom and air conditioning. My only criticism is breakfast not included in the price extra £25 each. ",5,2014,07,13
115,Amazing location quality and service,"This hotel offers quality boutique suites close to soho Coventry garden and Leicester square. Breakfast until 11,30 fantastic and the barman kabir is a great asset to the company with nothing a problem he looked after us well. Thank you all ",5,2014,07,13
115,Lovely hotel and great location,"I stayed here with my friend over a weekend. We had a lovely room. It was well equipped, ac, bathrobes/slippers, comfortable bed and great bathroom. The check in staff and concierge were very helpful, and spoken good English. The breakfast was included in our rate, and there was a good selection of choice including gluten free and vegetarian options. Although we had quite a wait for breakfast to arrive once we ordered.
The location is near to Oxford Street, and the bars and restaurants of Covent Garden & Soho. 
Lovely hotel",5,2014,07,13
115,An excellent hotel in a great location,"This was our second time to visit the Bloomsbury and we had no hesitation in booking when we decided to return to this area in London. The staff were both friendly and courteous at all times from the moment we arrived until our checkout,The standard room was a reasonable size and spotlessly clean. At night the room was silent and led to a good nights sleep. Breakfast was cooked fresh and there was an excellent choice at the buffet. We really enjoyed our stay here and I would recommend this highly.",5,2014,07,12
115,"""Excellent Customer Service""","Our recent 7 day stay at the Bloomsbury was our second visit in two years. In addition to the great location, outstanding breakfast and comfortable room, the customer service provided by the entire staff exceeded our already high expectations from our previous visit!   A special shout out to Kashif and Abdul at the front door; Maria, Estelita, and Chris in the dining room and Joel in the lounge! The Bloomsbury is a quality place with quality people. We enthusiastically recommend this hotel!",5,2014,07,11
115,"A pleasant surprise, outstanding and reasonably priced","We chose the Bloomsbury for an overnight stay whilst visiting a theatre in the West End to celebrate a special occasion. The hotel is located a short walk from the heart of Theatre Land which was one of the main reasons for selecting the hotel, however the hotels attention to detail in guest comfort and kind gesture helping us to celebrate a special occasion, incredibly comfortable room & bed is reason I would recommend the Bloomsbury Hotel to anyone considering staying in that part of town. The Hotel was clean and quiet, even at the weekend on the heart of London, and we would definitely stay again.",5,2014,07,10
115,Perfect Position,"An excellent hotel right in the thick of the action. Walking distance to most attractions but quiet in the rooms. The staff were very friendly and welcoming and quality is the theme through this gem.
The continental breakfast was by far the best we have come across with a wide variety of cold meats, cheeses, boiled eggs, pastries etc. etc
If you want a quality hotel in a great position this is the one to choose.",5,2014,07,10
115,Perfect for London getaway or business stay,"Stayed in June to celebrate our wedding anniversary. From the warm welcome of doorman Kashif to the attentive reception team, it was a real pleasure. 
We arrived the day of a London taxi strike (it was about 26 C) and we were hot and bothered - reception gave us hot hand towels and ice cold fresh lemonade to cool off while we checked in; lovely! 
It's a great central location for shopping & theatre and only a very short walk from the British Museum. Our room was small but perfect for our stay and the Resident's bar was cool, comfortable and intimate. Had a wonderful stay and look forward to going back!",5,2014,07,10
115,Review on hotel staff,"the Guest Relation Manager , Mr. Mohamed Zain treate us beyond all our expatations ,although  we  experienced many hotels all over the world we have never encounterd the warm & kind hospitality we got from him.",5,2014,07,10
115,Average hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in July during which we also held a conference at the same hotel.

The Check In was pleasant, late at night (around midnight) and within 10 minutes I could make my way to my room.

The hotel is a big building, with small elevators, which brought me to my floor (was 3rd floor I believe). When I got to the room I found that the room was actually very tiny, had no view (close by building) and had very thin walls. 

The room size was the size of the bed + narrow walk way around it, the quality of the bed was average and wasn't I nice comfy bed to sink into such as other international hotels offer. The barroom only had a bathtub/shower combo and also had a small footprint.

Breakfast was served in the hotel's restaurant, it was good, had quite a few options, good coffee(!) and there is a range of breakfast options to choose from from the menu.

All in all I would not return to this hotel if it was for a private trip and I could choose my own location.",3,2014,07,10
115,very nice,"This hotel is at a good place : near museums, restaurants, in a calm street. The staff is kindly, discreet and class. This is an historic modernized house, with a chic decoration, and a good restaurant.",5,2014,07,09
115,Exceptional,"We arrived 9:45PM for our 3 night stay directly from Heathrow after a long international flight and were a bit frazzled. The doorman rushed right up and took our bags and personally ushered us to the wonderful, courteous and prompt Reception Manager at the front desk. The atmosphere was soothing and the fresh squeezed juice was just what we needed. The doorman took care of everything and sent us down to the lovely and cozy bar / lounge to sip a delightful complementary martini while he took our bags to our room. What more can I say? Everyone at the Bloomsbury was amazing. Friendly, helpful, courteous and just plain nice! We ended each evening of our stay back at the hotel for a nightcap in the bar/lounge and each of the two bartenders on duty those nights were fantastic. The room was beautifully appointed, comfortable bed, AC that worked well and dead quiet! Perfect for a good nights sleep. Our room and the entire hotel were spotlessly clean. We could not have had a better location in all of London either. The Bloomsbury was just around the corner - no more than one block - from the Tottenham Court Rd Tube station on the Black line which made getting around all of London a breeze. We could not have been happier with our hotel choice and would definitely book again!!!",5,2014,07,09
115,Return visit - 2014 spring,"This hotel and staff just keep getting better - I spent 10 days here in May, with two friends and Brian and concierge staff, doormen, front desk staff and rooms personnel were all friendly, professional and beyond helpful.  The location is terrific also, within West End, Leicester Square and Covent Garden walking distance and of course the British Museum is just up the block.",5,2014,07,08
115,Brilliant!,"I spent ages chosing this hotel.  I wanted a good hotel for under £200 for a double per night.  I paid £174 for the Bloomsbury.  It was our Ruby Wedding Anniversary and the hotel didn't disappoint.

We were upgraded and had a card and cake delivered to the room.  Totally unexpected but much appreciated.  The room was compact but had everything you needed.  The bathroom was huge with a double shower as well as a bath.  Nice set of toiletries too.  The room was double glazed and despite being in the centre of London on a saturday night, we had a really quiet night's sleep.

The location of the hotel is great: 2 mins walk from exit 3 of the Tottenham Court Raod tube station.  Oxford Street is on your doorstep as well as Covent Garden and the British Museum.

I was impressed by the staff at this hotel: management is obviously good here as their ethos seems to be that guests should have a relaxing and pleasant stay.  This hotel has really reached a high standard of guest care.  No hesitation in recommending it.  One of the best hotels we've stayed at in central London and better than many who charge more.",5,2014,07,08
115,"Great Location, good all-rounder!","5 minutes in a cab from Euston, close to Covent Garden and West End (located a stones' throw from the British Museum, ideal location. Chose the hotel online because of the great reviews and it is perfectly true. I could not fault them. All the staff were very polite, helpful and attentive.We asked for a quiet room and got it, although the Great Russell Street was fairly quiet anyway. Rooms were to a good specification and although not large were cosy and ample for the purpose. Breakfast was terrific, with lots of choice and some great hot breakfasts on offer - yum!
Would I stay again - definitely. The Bloomsbury (Doyle Hotel Group) should be very proud of their staff, as they really were excellent. Well Done!!",4,2014,07,08
115,A definate must stay or else you will be dissapointed elsewhere,"Where do I start. I have stayed with work in a lot of the major hotels in London and I can say the Bloomsbury has a much better ambiance than any of them. The whole staff that we met were excellent in manner and service - nothing is to much trouble. The management should be very proud of how they train their staff to a standard not normally found in london hotels. 
We arrived about 11ish and went to check in first class service and our room was already for us. Went to the room and what a pleasure, clean, bight, excellent tasteful decor very well appointed (coffe machine, docking station, kettle, mini bar) we could have holed u there for the day but no we went off to the sites. Upon our return we went for afternoon tea another pleasure and make sure you have a chat with the Portuguese gentleman who may serve you - lots of knowledge and very helpful. 
Before we went to the theatre we had drinks in the bar and again another delight excellent lighting and surroundings. Upon our return the room had been given a tidy up by the staff and all was spotless again, not expected and a delight to find.
We had the continential breakfast - Just go and look at it and feast you eyes, we were taken aback by the choices of meats various breads and items.
My last point would be if you are staying elsewhere go and have a look at the Bloomsbury and see what you could have had, we will definately be going again.",5,2014,07,07
115,Afternoon Tea for a birthday treat!,"Bought as a birthday present, my sister and I had afternoon tea at the hotel.  

Walking in the front door we were wowed by the decadence of the lobby, not your average tea shop!!

Choice of 12 different teas, instead of a usual menu, we were handed a box containing sample of all teas to choose from.
The food was ample.  Sandwiches x 8, scones, jam and clotted cream x 4, fruit cake x 4, fruit tarts x 2, chocolate tarts x 2 and meringues x 2.  This was for two!  One plus was we could take anything we didn't eat home with us...which we did!!!  
The food was excellent, although the bread of the  sandwiches were a little dry!

The restrooms are worthy a visit, not only to see the immaculate facilities, but it gives you an opportunity to wander a little around the hotel...beautiful hotel!

We would love to have afternoon tea again and share it with our family and friends!
A truly wonderful birthday treat!!",4,2014,07,06
115,Just perfect London stay,"This hotel has a nice ""english"" feeling, nice lobby, comfortable and nice rooms and bathroom. Very good location close to Convent Garden, British museum, and Oxford Street.  Good service and kind and helpful staff. Good concierge recomendations for restaurants, etc.
Nice neibourghood too!  Recommendable London hotel.",4,2014,07,04
115,Lovely stay,"My family and I wanted to stay in an interesting section of London to see both London and take day trips outside of the city.  This hotel was perfect for that.  It is in the Bloomsbury area of London which is interesting, it is near the Tottenham Court Underground, and it is well-served by London taxis.  It is almost across the street from the British Museum, so we could go over for a couple of hours and then go back another time to avoid the overload we sometimes get when spending all day in a museum.  It was easy to get to rail stations for the trips outside of London:  Bletchley Park, Cambridge, Canterbury and the White Cliffs of Dover, and a group ""special access"" tour to Stonehenge with Golden Tours.  On this tour you go before or after the park is open and you are taken to actually walk among the stones.  Fantastic experience!  

The hotel was lovely and the staff were extremely attentive.  They knew us by name by the second day.  We had a package that included a full English breakfast, which is well worth it if you are breakfast eaters like we are.  The food was delicious and varied.  Everything from a serve yourself breakfast bar with breads, cheeses, tarts, fruit, yoghurt, cold cereal, and water and juices, to a full kitchen menu.  I especially loved the omelet and the porridge.  For us Americans they also had coffee!!  And it's fun to try the ""full English breakfast"" too.    

The concierge, Brian, and his staff deserve special mention.  They were helpful with local recommendations, but Brian really helped on our ""ancestor adventure!""  I had found a VERY small area north of London called Edworth.  To get there, we had to take a train to Biggleswade, get a taxi to Edworth Manor Farm, look around at the church on the property (St. George's) be picked up by the taxi and taken to a bus station in Great Barford, ride the bus to Cambridge for the afternoon, and take a train back to London.  With Brian's help making phone calls and arrangements for us, it worked perfectly and was a wonderful day.  Even my skeptical husband acknowledged that it was fun and worked out like clockwork.

The rooms at the hotel are very nice too.  We had a large room on the 6th floor.  However, our son and daughter-in-law had a room on the 7th floor which was nice also, but much smaller even though it was in the same category as our room.  Someone later told us that the rooms on the 7th and 8th floor are smaller.

Overall, I can't recommend the hotel enough.",5,2014,07,04
115,"Charming Hotel, Great Location","Right by the British Museum and next door to Soho and Covent Garden, the location of this pretty hotel can't be beat. Beautiful lobby with fantastic smelling candles welcome you, outdoor terrace for cocktails, cozy, clubby bar, and lovely staff. I recommend.",5,2014,07,04
115,Beautiful hotel and lovely staff,"My fiance and I stayed here recently for our 5th anniversary and the staff treated us like royalty.  They were considerate, showed interest and attentive in all areas of their duty.  The hotel is impeccably clean and nicely furnished too.  The hotel is also located well within easy walk of covent garden, oxford street and the west end theatres, so an excellent choice for anyone to explore the big city.  Couldn't recommend more :)",5,2014,07,03
115,Memorable,"We don't usually stay in 5 star hotels but spoilt ourselves for the start of a Europe holiday by staying a few days here.  The location is excellent, just off Oxford Street, 2 minutes from Tottenham Court Underground and walking distance to a lot if a London attractions and the West End theaters.  We will remember this hotel for being a little different - olde style character with modern amenities. As you would expect, service is very good and the room was nicely appointed.  On the other hand the bed was soft, the fridge accommodated the mini bar only  and we found the bar very expensive.  On balance, yes, memorable but for us not really value for money.

If you are traveling to the hotel via Underground from Heathrow, we suggest going to a Holborn and transferring there to the Central Line to Tottenham Court.  A challenge transferring with bags in the peak hours but otherwise very easy.",4,2014,07,01
115,short break,"We stayed for a short break. Very good location you could walk everywhere, yet it was not noisy. The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The room was very clean and comfortable.  I would recommend it to anyone.  We cannot comment on the food as we ate out.",5,2014,06,30
115,A quality hotel ...,"Stayed here during a weekend break in London. I stay in a lot of hotels on business and this is up there with the best. Good location and within easy walking distance of Covent Garden, the theatre district, Oxford St., etc. 

We had a superior room which was nicely furnished to a high standard and spotlessly clean. A little small but perfect for a short stay.

I don't recommend many hotels that I stay in but I'd recommend this one.",4,2014,06,29
115,Amazing!,"Stayed here for one night and I did not want to leave!

All the staff are extremely professional and helpful. The Hotel is in a great location, the rooms are modern, comfortable and hard to top.

I visit London quite regularly and can honestly say I hope to make the Bloomsbury Hotel my home away from home.

Cannot wait to go back.",5,2014,06,29
115,Love it,"Its a lovely building. Rock and roll location. The interior is really something else. Its lavish but warm and welcoming. The room are small but cosey and you dont feel cramped. Its a special place to stay. Good beds, quiet for sleeping. A classy classic. Will return.",5,2014,06,28
115,"Sonya W  ""Great time in London UK""","I stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel in London, UK.  It was very nice and clean.  The people were very friendly.  It was located to local shops and restaurants.  The British museum was within walking distance.  Also, you could walk to Soho, Picadilly Circus, and Leceister Square.  The only thing that I did not like about the hotel is that we saw a mouse in the hotel lobby.  Also, the rooms are very small but are ver clean. We informed staff and they took care of it.  Other than that, we had a great time.  The breakfast was good.  The hotel is convenient to the subway station as well.  Overall, the stay was great!",4,2014,06,25
115,great stay,"We stayed just for one night for and to see a show. Really excellent hotel.Had hot towels and drink at reception.Lovely room with air conditioning, very quiet with a turn down service..Great location near to tube and West End. Excellent breakfast and attentive staff.Really felt this was a very special hotel. Really the best hotel in the area",5,2014,06,24
115,Quality option in London,Excellent hotel that I would be happy to recommend for a trip to London. Superb location for all types of visitors. Staff extremely friendly in general and were very pleasant and efficient in particular at reception.,5,2014,06,24
115,Old world meets new - brilliant,"I stayed on business last October and was not disappointed. In fact the disappointing thing was that I had to check out and leave. 

Good points:
Location to Oxford street & West end theaters
Beautiful boutique hotel
Would prefer over both Raddisson hotels which are 60 second walk away
Quiet location - which is ironic given its location to Oxford street
Service service and service - this is how it is done, from receptionists, restaurant staff to porters
Room size is good for central London 
5 minute walk to Tottenham Court road tube station
Very nice breakfast

Bad points:
I had to leave
Couldn't fault it on this trip,

I am due to stay here again in July so I will be interested to see if the hotel has maintained its standards since my last trip. 

I stay in this part of London regularly and this hotel can be pricey relative to the 2 Radisson hotels which as I mentioned above are extremely close however if you are not price sensitive, or an a personal trip, then I would choose this one every time.",4,2014,06,22
115,One of the Best,"We have just had 2 wonderful nights at The Bloomsbury. From the moment we checked in we were made to feel special and when they found out it was my wife's birthday and our anniversary they lavished  us with little extras.  The room was comfortable, the food was excellent  and the staff were so attentive and friendly.  It's position just off Tottenham Court Road and 2 minutes from Oxford Street is so handy.  Next trip London this will be the hotel of our choice. Never got to use the fitness  centre so cannot comment.  Criticism, the usual one, the room lighting is inadequate.  Why do all the hotels forget that women need to do their hair and put on their make up",5,2014,06,22
115,Mixing business and pleasure,"Of course wherever one stays depends so much on one's needs and this hotel fit well with adding a touch of indulgence to a business trip. The location provides easy access to reasonable eating, shopping, and of course the British Museum is right there. But if you are comfortable walking in London and open to exploring it's a great spot. Easy access to trains and busses too. But the staff is what really makes Bloomsbury shine. Every single one took excellent time and attention to help the guests. Thanks to all!!",5,2014,06,22
115,Perfect location with friendly staff,"I and my husband spent a little over a week in London on a research trip and holiday in early May. We chose the Bloomsbury Hotel mainly for its location and reputation, and for the fact that it was a ""nice"" hotel that fit within our budget. We were not disappointed. It was easy to get to from LHR via the tube (Tottenham Court Road station is right around the corner), and as soon as we arrived the staff made us feel welcome and answered all of our questions. Some Americans may find the standard room to be small, but it suited our needs with the en-suite bath and a desk. The lighting was a little dim and there was only a wardrobe for our clothes, but it was sufficient. I did appreciate the hotel's efforts at energy conservation; the lights only stayed on if you inserted the room key into the wall switch, so they were off while we were out. Primarily, the location was ideal; across the street from the British Museum, lots of places to eat nearby, a park down the street, quiet (for a city), and within walking distance of the West End, Trafalger Square, the National Gallery, Parliament, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, and so much more. We walked to many more places than we thought we would. In short, we will always stay at the Bloomsury when in London.",5,2014,06,21
115,Afternoon tea,"As part of a gift from our daughter and her husband we had afternoon tea at The Bloomsbury Hotel prior to going to the theatre.  What a lovely hotel - elegant and a quiet oasis in the middle of London. The service was friendly, efficient and we were in no way rushed. The lounge where we ate was beautifully decorated with pleasant music playing unobtrusively in the background. As for the food - delicate sandwiches, warm scones with jam and cream, fruit cake, merangues, strawberry and chocolate pastries and choice of teas and coffee it was well presented and tasted wonderful. I'm struggling to find fault so l hope the hotel will take this as advice rather than criticism when l suggest the use of cake forks rather than ordinary forks they are just more practical. We can thoroughly recommend.",5,2014,06,20
115,Lovely Hotel,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is a beautiful boutique hotel in a great location, it is in the centre of London walking distance to The British Museum, Leicester Square, Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden.  The staff are very welcoming and polite and very friendly. The room was very comfortable although quite small, but was comfortable for our 7 night stay and the bathroom was an excellent size with nice amenities and huge thick bath towels.  Free WiFi  throughout the hotel. Breakfast was very generous The Landseer Bar was great for a drink in the evening. there are lots of restaurants and pubs very close by. Would love to stay again",5,2014,06,19
115,Amazing Hotel!!,"Stayed here for one night as a birthday treat.. Loved this hotel so much!! It is a  really really nice hotel, clean and modern hotel and the staff are very friendly!! :) Situated in a really good location, not far from the tube station.",5,2014,06,19
115,Wonderful service and splendid accommodation,"rich breakfast, polite staff, the concierge always had good tour tips, the Landseer bar at evening was a really good surprise. the service and ambient was great. and most important - best location, in the center of London and quiet !",5,2014,06,17
115,Old world charm close to some of London's best shopping,"The Bloomsbury is a lovely boutique hotel in a great location if you intend to shop up a storm at the likes of M&S, Uniqlo, Zara, TopShop etc - although finding space in your room to store the results of your shopping may propose a challenge! The rooms are nicely appointed (although quite compact) but the bathrooms are almost impractically small. 
Overall the hotel could do with a bit of a refresh - the lifts were incredibly small and unreliable and the hotel overall was perhaps a little dark and gloomy once you walked past the reception area (which was actually quite lovely).
Staff at The Bloomsbury were exceptionally friendly at all times and the service levels were of a high standard (although they did charge us for a breakfast we did not have but the error was readily rectified). We didn't include the breakfast buffet in our booking so unable to comment on the food quality but the bar was a warm and friendly place to visit for a drink in the evenings with very accommodating staff.
The Bloomsbury is a great hotel if you want to be close to the shopping without being in the heart of activity and noise - unless you are prepared to spend the big bucks to upgrade to a suite, be prepared for small living quarters -  but if you don't intend to spend too much time in your room, this shouldn't really matter anyway.",4,2014,06,17
115,Great hotel - great staff,"Me and my daughter stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in June. Smallest room I have ever been in in a 4 star hotel, but didn't mind, loved it, great location and most of all great staff, so helpful. Giving us the best directions when we were traveling e.t.c. Thank you Brian and the others. Hope to be back. I definitely can recommend this hotel.",4,2014,06,17
115,Good Well-located hotel as long as you can get into your room!,"We were here for 3 nights while seeing some shows and visiting British Museum and National Gallery, for which it is pretty well located. Standard room was typically small given the amount of luggage we had, but well-appointed. Bathroom one at a time only thank you. 

Free wifi was very good as was complimentary Nespresso machine. Continental Breakfast OK but choice somewhat limited. Our main problem was getting into room. Our keys failed and it eventually (after we nearly missed a deadline) turned out that the door battery was bung. And to add insult to injury we were locked out of the room immediately we paid the bill even though we needed access to it for a while longer. It is their highly annoying policy apparently 

But staff were all very obliging, particularly at front desk when some printing etc was needed.",4,2014,06,17
115,Fantastic Hotel,"My wife and I were absolutely delighted at the way staff treated us. We arrived early and there was no problem from the staff in being able to accommodate us. Very friendly, curteous and  helpful. The hotel itself is very clean, the rooms are spacious and breakfast is excellent. We will return.",5,2014,06,17
115,Excellent stay in London,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is not in the middle of shopping, but rather, paces away from the British Museum.  It is located in the center of the center of London - surprisingly quiet for such a busy area.  Breakfast was very good with lots of options. Our room was comfortable, clean and modern and the staff was very helpful, going out of their way to make my stay better.  I have already recommended the hotel to a friend who often has guests to London and needs good recommendations.  Very pleased with my stay.",5,2014,06,16
115,"Great hotel , great location","I stayed here for 1night with my husband, as we were going to a concert at 02. The greeting from staff was second to none, the hotel is spotless and room was spacious and clean. Breakfast was another hit, being cooked to order and to your liking. Would love to stay again however slightly out of my budget, however saying that from hotels I have stayed at in London this outstrips others. Staff were friendly and couldn't do enough for you. Keep up the good work. ",5,2014,06,16
115,Revisited and still great!,"Stayed here again almost a year since last time and not disappointed. Very clean, comfortable room. Hotel in very central position. Staff great and breakfast excellent. Love how it's freshly cooked to order. Will return.",5,2014,06,16
115,London break ,"Stayed at this hotel in December 2013, just wanted to get away for a short break to the capital.. We did some research and thought we had found the ideal hotel... How wrong we were, 
It wasn't cheap either... The room was dirty, and cramped, we ended up in a basement room, the breakfast wasn't upto much either, poor quality products... I think this was advertised as a four star hotel... I don't know how they get away with it!!! Thank god it was only three nights.. Wouldn't stay there again.. ",2,2014,06,16
115,Birthday trip to London,"I came to the Bloomsbury for my birthday weekend, having travelled from Sheffield, I wanted this to be a amazing weekend. Not only was the hotel beautiful and the service fantastic, I felt so very special to check into my room and find a beautiful birthday cake and card waiting for me. So personal and yet so simple. I will be returning without any doubt and thank you for making my weekend a fantastic one.",5,2014,06,14
115,A Lovely London Experience at the Bloomsbury Hotel,"Very clean comfortable room with all modern conveniences. Great location, friendly competent staff give the hotel a very personal touch. Excellent breakfast, enjoyed drinks in the bar, overall good atmosphere, would definitely recommend it and will return on my next trip.",5,2014,06,14
115,You can do better,"My wife and I spent four nights at the Bloomsbury in a superior room.  The location was great as it was only 11/2 blocks from the British Museum and a short walk to the theater district, the Royal Opera, and Covent Garden.  It was also a modest walk to the sites of “official London” such as Parliament, Big Ben, etc.  A variety of reasonably priced (for London, that is) cafes and restaurants are also quite close.

The room was adequate in size with sufficient storage space and a large, comfortable bed.  There was even space to put our suitcases out of the way.  The view out the window of the building across the street wasn’t very thrilling, but that really didn’t matter very much.  What did matter, however, was the extremely small bathroom that contained a combination bath/shower that never really provided hot water. Try as we might, neither my wife nor I were ever able to get a hot shower in our four days at the Bloomsbury.  Additionally, the bathroom was so small that it was quite difficult to turn around without bumping into something.

While the service in the lobby was very good, housekeeping was sketchy.  On two evenings the housekeepers came so early for turn-down service that we had yet to leave for dinner.  Similarly, the number and types of towels left for us were erratic.

In summary, in spite of its excellent location, I’m sure you can do better than the Bloomsbury.",3,2014,06,13
115,viking weekend,"just to let everybody know what a-wonderful weekend we had staying at the bloomsbury hotel for my husbands birthday, we went to the viking exebition and in the evening we had a lovely meal in the restaurant at the end of our meal they came out with a birthday cake and even sang happy birthday brilliant.   the staff were really helpful and  very friendly the room was clean with lovely soft towels  would recommend  this hotel to you all.",5,2014,06,13
115,Wonderful city break,We stayed at the bloomsbury whilst we had a city break in london. The staff were so friendly and couldnt do enough for you. The hotel was beautiful and felt so welcoming. The location was  ideal as we were at the theatre that night.Would definately recomend,5,2014,06,13
115,Bloomsbury hotel,"This is a lovely hotel which is very convenient for west end, Euston and St Pancras.  My husband and I  stayed here last weekend to attend a family party nearby.  Comfortable rooms, very quiet and good for disabled guests.  Staff couldn't do enough for us but didn't sample food as we were visiting relatives.  Would definitely stay there again if in London.",5,2014,06,13
115,One of my favorite hotels,"We had an excellent stay - lovely atmosphere, extremely helpful and friendly staff, delicious breakfast (the only meal I had at the hotel, but I had it daily), and a very central location.  We even had problems with our flights having been booked incorrectly, and the hotel was accommodating when we had to turn up a day early.  The walk from the tube station was barely a block, and we were able to easily explore the city and got good dinner recommendations from the staff.

It was just what I look for in a hotel: elegant, friendly, well-located - and it always smelled great, to boot.  They have fancy candles in the reception that weren't overpowering.",5,2014,06,13
115,Good London hotel,"Really nice hotel - stayed here for my husband's 40th. The room was on the small side but to be expected in London. It was clean and nicely decorated. The hotel had a great location and we were able to walk everywhere but in spite of this it was very quiet and we weren't disturbed by noise at all. The staff were all incredibly friendly, helpful and polite and dealt with a broken coffee machine immediately. We didn't have breakfast included as this seemed quite expensive and didn't eat at the hotel. Overall impressed by the general ambience and really good staff.",4,2014,06,10
115,A nightmare from start to finish,"What a shambles of a stay. 

The good? Great location. Rooms are decent.

The bad: checking in, the receptionist informed me that he couldn't make a transaction with my card. Next day I ring my back to find out that contrary to what the receptionist said, €366 euro was withdrawn from my account by the Bloomsbury!!!? Incompetence.

When I tried to settle the remaining outstanding balance I was met by a hotel receptionist manager who made a simple transaction as confusing as possible and delivered every reply in a most condescending tone. I will never know why some people choose a customer facing role!

At night when coming back to the hotel I discovered my card didn't work to gain access to my room. Again, back to reception I went. this time with the night staff to deal with. Different staff but same terrible attitude. The concierge sarcastically suggested he walk me to my room in a manner that suggested I wasn't bright enough to work the door! Thanks pal!

As for value for money, this place is a bit of a joke. Continental breakfast is something  like 12 pounds for toast porridge and juice. 

The jokers charged me for my complimentary paper on check out too.

Avoid.

115,Enjoyable sty,Having stayed in this hotel several times whilst on a weekend theatre break to London we found this hotel very comfortable. There is always clean linen the rooms are warm and there is always hot water. Breakfast is varied and enjoyable.,4,2014,06,10
115,very well located British hotel,nice sweet british hotel very well located near the British museum and close to Tottenham station in a quite area. Breakfast could be more complete with a larger choice of vegetables and more warm dishes like sausages and sunny up eggs in the continental buffet.,5,2014,06,07
115,Room and breakfast not at the required standards,"This is supposed to be a high end hotel in one of the best areas of London, and it is priced accordingly. Therefore you would not expect a room with a tiny window facing a wall just a couple of meters away, and a bathroom with a sink so small you can not even wash your hands comfortably (see photo, the size is the one of an airplane sink).
At breakfast you will find some frozen fruits, that are not yet unfrozen...
A lot of better alternatives in London!",2,2014,06,06
115,Brilliant hotel,"This was by far the best hotel I've ever stayed in and would recommend to anyone. I took my girlfriend here for valentines day and it was well worth the 1-2 hour trip. The staff were incredibly friendly, helpful and attentive, e.g. helping me locate a nice restaurant for an evening meal. The hotel is located perfectly, close range to Oxford Street for shopping during the day, with a lot of restaurants surrounding for the evening. The stay itself was incredible; the room was immaculate on arrival and in the morning you won't want to leave the bed due to the comfiness.",5,2014,06,05
115,Refuge for a weary traveller,"I was delighted with this hotel when I spent a night there after a wearying sojourn in Africa. The staff gave me a warm welcome and allowed me to check into the room early, for which I was very grateful.  The room was more spacious than I expected for a major city, and was very nicely appointed.  The bathroom seemed quite luxurious, as well.  The location, within easy walking distance of the British Museum and other central London attractions, was very convenient, allowing a person to return to stash packages or rest for a few minutes between destinations.  Although  I ate dinner in the hotel's restaurant mainly because I was too tired to go anywhere else,  I was pleasantly surprised at the delicious food and the charming, candlelit atmosphere. My 6:15 wake-up call on the morning I left was followed by the delivery of a perfect cup of coffee, a very nice touch.  I would stay here again.",5,2014,06,04
115,Outstanding Hotel,"Brian, the concierge, was like an old friend every night waiting for us when we came home. He gave us great suggestions, helped us with our reservations, and always had a smile on his face. Maria in the restaurant was so helpful in getting my lactaid-free milk and greeted me daily by my name. Louise at the front desk explained the bill to me and was so helpful--what a place. It's worth every penny. The hotel room was clean and bright with nice amenities. Great location--we went to the theatre two nights we were there and it's all within walking distance, and the British Museum is in the next block. If you're going for fish and chips, a few blocks away is Rock and Soul--yummy! If we go back to London, why would I stay anywhere else?",5,2014,06,02
115,The Bloomsbury Hotel London,"Fantastic hotel very welcoming ,Concierge go above and beyond ,reception staff lovely check in and out very quick offered towels,  refreshments.  Rooms very comfortable and spotless beds turned down every night and chocolates .Dressing  gown ,slippers , Nespresso provided .Towels changed daily and rooms cleaned .Joel the bar men in Landseer bar is one of the nicest people you could every meet service excellent a true gentlemen and a credit to the Bloomsbury. Breakfast is quality and nothing is to much trouble always addressed by our full names nice touch in my eyes that they take the time to remember guests thank you Maria for looking after us  would not hesitate in recommending this hotel best hotel I have ever stayed at and look forward to going back next year . Kind regards Mr & Mrs Cavener",5,2014,06,02
115,Perfect London Hotel,"My husband and I stayed in The Bloomsbury Hotel for two nights and we could not have enjoyed our stay more: The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, The room was really spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was also spacious, very nicely decorated and stocked with shower gel and body lotion etc which were lovely to use. We were also impressed that there was not only a kettle in the room for making tea but an espresso machine for real coffee.
The breakfast is fabulous: The pastries are as good as the best French patisserie, there is fresh fruit and excellent yogurt along with an extensive menu of  cooked dishes and the healthy options are a fantastic idea. 
As for the location: It could not be better: Incredibly central but in a neighbourhood of character. 
The fact that this hotel was designed by the famous architect Lutyens was the icing on the cake.",5,2014,06,02
115,Fantastic Hotel in the heart of Theatre Land,This is just a fantastic hotel.  Rooms are large and really clean the staff are very helpful.  Location is amazing right in the heart of theatre land.  Food service was slow but food good when it did arrive!  We will be going back!,5,2014,06,02
115,Perfect,"A lovely hotel, excellent staff, best location possible for seeing London. It's right near a tube stop, but we never used it because almost everything is in walking distance. The room is very nice, with a great shower. It is small, but more than adequate for 2 people. Definitely will stay here again when we come back to London. ",5,2014,05,31
115,London mini break,"Excellent hotel, welcomed in from heavy rain and Porter took cases from us and showed us to the reception desk to allow us to check in where we were given hot, wet cloths to freshen up! Room on 7th floor, adequate sized, lovely decor, clean bathroom with toiletries which were replaced during our 3 night stay. Well stocked tea tray with Nespresso machine, although we didn't use it as we weren't sure how to! Didn't  see instructions however they may have been there and we just didn't see them. Bed turned down and dressing gown placed on bed with slippers on first night along with 2 chocolates! Bed turned down every other night and chocolates appeared again! Free Bottles of water were replaced daily
Breakfast was fabulous with a large continental buffet and hot options available. The staff were very welcoming and friendly especially Maria and Espelita who were very attentive and always asked if we would like more toast and coffee etc!
When we were leaving  the friendly porter who we had spoken to a couple of times in the lift took my case to the front door for me and My husband was offered a couple of small bottles of water for the flight home.
All in all a lovely hotel, pricey but in a great location. Would certainly go back again and recommend to anyone
NB if you are coming from Heathrow, don't do what we did and get off the tube at Holburn as it's quite a walk with luggage. Change at Leicester Square and head for Tottenham Ct Rd and it's just round the corner!",5,2014,05,30
115,The Bloomsbury Hotel London,Good Hotel the location is excellent; the hotel is pretty much in walking distance of many London attractions including the British museum which is up the street from the hotel. The staff is courteous and helpful. The rooms are clean and well kept.,4,2014,05,30
115,Great hotel in a great location,"You will not find a much better hotel in London, the staff is very helpful, the rooms are large (by London standards), the quality and cleanliness are all brilliant. There is also free wifi and attentive staff throughout. Would highly recommend others to stay here.",5,2014,05,30
115,A rare pleasent experience with London hotels,"Stayed 1 night for business. This is probably the first hotel in London where I actually felt ""at home"". Difficult to say why in detail - but let me highlight a few points
- The breakfast was really(!) nice. As someone who stays 50-100 nights a year in hotels I must say that the breakfast was really above and beyond what I normally found. A nice touch for example with the fresh orange juice 
- The Juicery - an on-site juice bar. The ""Malted Milkshake"" with cocunut water, almond butter, dates and vanilla protein was great after the morning workout. The other alternatives also looked great.
- the room was both comparatively large (for London) and well kept. 

Overall: I will return - really easy to see why this is one of the top ranking hotels in London. Only downside: The fitness center was at best ""average"": A room in the basement with a 4 cardio and a few lifting positions - but still OK",5,2014,05,30
115,Home away from home,"The Bloomsbury hotel has become my favorite place to stay in London when I go for business. Location is very convenient right off the Totterham Court tube station, 5 minute walking distance to Oxford Street and the British Museum. All of the staff members have been friendly and helpful. They make sure that I feel comfortable and well taken care of every time I stay. What I really adore about this hotel is that its rooms are just cozy, but yet modern. Lobby smells like heaven. Upon checking in, staff often offers water or tea. I sleep well even though I often struggling with jetlag. The rooms are equipped with lots of outlet and plugs for all sorts of tech accessories. 

I can't wait for my return to the Bloomsbury.",5,2014,05,29
115,Everything you want,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is everything you want and need when it comes to a London Hotel. The location is perfect, just a short walk from Covent Garden, Oxford Street etc. and the food was fantastic. From the lobby to the bedrooms, the place just oozes class. You won’t find a better hotel at such a reasonable price. Wonderful experience.",5,2014,05,29
115,"Expensive, but room, service, and location great","Just a little stroll from the British Museum and within a few blocks of three subway lines, the Bloomsbury was an excellent choice for a London base.  Everything went smoothly from the doorman taking our luggage upstairs to the concierge arranging for a taxi to a hassle-free front desk experience.  The room was reasonably spacious for a couple, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean and more than adequate, and everything was quiet.  I had requested a walk-in shower and received it. No doubt we would return.  Newspapers were available in the comfortable lounge.

The Bloomsbury had several restaurants and room service but we felt we could do better elsewhere, and did.    Nor did we try the breakfast (which, being London, was not included) but found a small, spare Italian cafe right across the street for breakfast Panini to excellent cappuccino and cornetti, made by a native Italiano who was as friendly as can be.

We stayed three nights.",5,2014,05,29
115,Oasis of calm in the centre of London,"Stayed for one night at this hotel to see Miss Saigon and we have been totally spoilt. Nothing has been too much trouble for any of the staff , rooms spotless, reception helpful, breakfast plentiful. Having stayed at many hotels over the years this has to be one of the best. ",5,2014,05,29
115,"Comfortable, stylis, cosy with a homefeel touch","I loved staying in this hotel although there have been some issues. The area is perfect (near to Oxford Street), rooms incredibly large (only a bit too dark), staff nice and helpful, really tried their best (although often forgot me:-)
In  the room you have all you need incl. bathrobe, slippers, complimentary wi-fi and bottles of water. 
Problems: NO breakfast option for people with cow milk allergy (all breads and pastry contain milk). I also ordered an inroom breakfast and didn't get it (after being waiting for almost an hour I had to cancel it). Minibar in the room locked (and hasn't been unlocked although I asked for it). Not even a tiny space in the minibar for storing you own stuff in it (I had some medical products that I had to store in the kitchen and request it all the time which was a bit annoying for both sides).",4,2014,05,29
115,Wonderful Experience!  Highly Recommend,"My wife and I arrived at this hotel and were promptly greeted by a very courteous and professional staff.  We stayed here for 5 wonderful nights and every day was a pleasure.  The location can't be beat with the both the British Museum and Oxford Street in walking distance.  It was also easy to walk to Covent Garden and 2 tube stations are a short walk from the hotel.

We had a wonderful dinner at the restaurant downstairs and then we met Joel the bartender who made this experience even more special.  Joel was one of the best bartenders I have ever met.  He takes care of his customers like they are royalty.  He made my wife and I feel like we were at home.  When we go back to this hotel, we will definitely look forward to meeting Joel again.

The price of this hotel was very reasonable given how close it is to the center of they city.  We will definitely be staying here again when we come back to London!",5,2014,05,28
115,Lovely hotel ...excellent service....great location,"Stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel for one night. What a lovely place, offered lemonade on arrival and hot face cloth to freshen up. Stayed in a standard double room which was well equipped, clean and comfortable.  Location excellent, a few  minutes walk from  Tottenham Court Road tube station and ideally located for the West End and Covent Garden. I will definitely stay here again, very impressed.",5,2014,05,28
115,Lovely experience,"Great place & food, loved the rooms & location means there's so much on your doorstep! Can't wait to come back. Staff were lovely, rooms pleasant & comfy, service was top-drawer, and all in the heart of London. I've stayed at lots of hotels, and this is right up there. Mark my words! Oh so very much. ",5,2014,05,28
115,"Lovely Staff, Lovely Stay!",I stayed here with my girlfriend and we both thoroughly enjoyed our time. The location was excellent and the staff were some of the nicest I have come across. We didn't have any issues and shall be staying here again very soon!,5,2014,05,28
115,"Excellent stay, definately recommend","The hotel is very well located at a quiet street, but close to the main West End attractions and shopping areas. The staff was very helpful and friendly, the room was big enough and had everything you need for a short stay including a coffee machine! Internet is free throughout the hotel, although the speed is quite slow - that is an area to improve. Breakfast was quite good, and there are a couple of supermarkets close to the hotel open till late.  I enjoyed my morning exercises in the fitness room, well equipped and airy. Will definitely stay at the Bloomsbury next time visiting London!",5,2014,05,27
115,Fantastic hotel,"If you're looking for a good hotel in London that is not over-priced but still delivers a top class quality service, then look no further.  The touch of Ireland with the reception staff was an added bonus.  Rooms good size and very clean.  Food to a high standard.  Definitely recommend.",5,2014,05,27
115,Afternoon tea at the Bloomsbury,"We had afternoon tea here on 15th May and it was a wonderful experience.
We started with a glass of Bloomsbury champagne (one must)! before sampling the delicious sandwiches, scones with jam and clotted cream and the pastries, which were to die for, all served up by a most professional gentleman from the Algarve who was very friendly and informative.
I would recommend this experience to anyone who is visiting London and this hotel as it was an afternoon to remember",5,2014,05,27
115,"Beautiful hotel, Great location!","Stayed over the christmas holidays. Beautiful, clean hotel. Very friendly and helpful staff. Front desk was eager to assist with directions. If you get a chance, try the afternoon tea for a truly English experience. Would definitely recommend to others and stay here again!",5,2014,05,27
115,Another brilliant stay,"After staying in December 2013, we decided to book again and stayed this weekend, just as good. Can't recommend enough. Staff all so pleasant but not over top. Stayed in a smaller room this time (our choice), still didn't matter. Don't hesitate to stay here.",5,2014,05,25
115,Returning in July...,"I'm delighted to say that I have made plans to return to The Bloomsbury for my next trip to London this summer.  As I wrote last year, I am a novice traveler, but I do understand comfort & familiarity.  The Bloomsbury is now my ""home-away-from-home"" in London, a great but beastly city for a shy but excited world traveler.  I am comforted to know, from experience, the high quality concierge of The Bloomsbury; their collective commitment, their work ethic & their passion to make their hotel authentically that ""third place"" for their clients is the stuff that brings me back ""home.""",5,2014,05,25
115,Another Excellent Stay,"Just returned from a weekend at the Bloomsbury. We stayed in a junior suite on the fifth floor and I shall request this room on our next visit. The room was wonderful! It had triple aspect large windows, a massive bathroom that was beautifully appointed, a very comfy bed, and a large sitting area with comfy chairs to lounge on. I could go on and on but suffice to say we were impressed.

Every member of staff we encountered was polite, helpful and professional. We had drinks in the bar both nights and were served be Joel who made us extremely welcome. Breakfast was excellent both mornings. 

Can't wait for an excuse to stay again. ",5,2014,05,25
115,great conference venue,I was here for the day for a conference. The central London venue was excellent and easy to reach from both tube and national rail. Food at lunch time was great with a variety of meals to suit all tastes.  An excellent central London venue for a conference.,4,2014,05,24
115,"Great hotel, Great location, Great service","I highly recommend if you looking for clean rooms, excellent hospitality and a great location then stay at the Bloomsbury.  I was there for a quick business trip but truly enjoyed my stay.  We had dinner at their restaurants twice and both times we had excellent service and the food was fabulous.  I will definitely make this my place at home when I'm in London again.  ",5,2014,05,24
115,Great little hotel,"This hotel was in a great location, and we were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room as it was in Europe. The room was very clean, and modern. In room coffee was good. Bed comfortable. The only complaint is that the bathroom lighting was a little dim, so hard to see well to put makeup on. 

Staff was also great. Our rate included breakfast, and the continental buffet was wonderful. 

Would definitely consider staying here again next time.",4,2014,05,23
115,Good quality hotel,"Staff very helpful and welcoming, clean hotel, proper nespresso coffee machine in room - turndown service and great location - would highly reccomend for business travellers or pleasure - great bar in the basement ",5,2014,05,23
115,A great English hotel,"Only stayed here one night on a business trip. Great reception staff, couldn't have been more helpful. The hotel is very tastefully decorated. Great rooms and a fantastic library.  The food in the restaurant is very good, with excellent seafood option. Would definitely stay here again.  Could do with a bit more natural light but then again so could most London hotels.",4,2014,05,23
115,Amazing,"Loves everything in this hotel..Gr8 work they are so kind. Helpfulness.nice decoration. .nice stuff so kindly ..clean hotel..i love the location so quite either they dont disturb me..thanks a lot for

 everyone. .Kind regards",5,2014,05,22
115,"Good Value, friendly staff, Location spot on","Stayed Easter Saturday and got a really good deal . Booked via link on trip advisor, Hotel was very clean and tidy, friendly and welcoming staff, slippers and dressing gowns even in the standard room.

Location perfect.",5,2014,05,22
115,Favourite stay in London!,"My favourite stay in London by far. The hotel and staff provide such a warm welcome you don’t want to leave. My boyfriend and I stayed here recently and couldn’t have asked for more, the quality and attention to detail in the rooms, cleanliness of the entire hotel and of course the food menus are outstanding. More than happy to recommend this hotel to everyone we know and will happily visit again.",5,2014,05,22
115,Amazing experience,"I recently stayed at the Bloomsbury hotel during a short business trip. The hotel location is great as is is close to major shopping areas, restaurants and bars, as well as many touristic places (3 minute walk to the British museum). The rooms are great, and even though the bathrooms are not very large, they work perfectly. The service, in general, is amazing. I had dinner at the hotel restaurant a couple of times and found the food to be fresh and honest, a lot better than what you would expect from a ""regular"" hotel restaurant. All in all, this was a great experience and I know exactly where to stay the next time I travel to London.",5,2014,05,21
115,good 4 star hotel,"i stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in may and had a great time. 

the check-in was very friendly and our luggage was brought up to the room straight away. the entrance as well as the building is very well kept and the interiors are a mix of oriental but luxurious old english style with lots of wood and dark reds. 
we had a superior room on the fith floor which is about 21 sqare meters. the room is a decent size for london but for a superior room i would expect a double bathroom. there was only one sink and no place to hang the hand towel. across from the window is an office building so you can't ever really have the curtains up during the week and you can see right in.
the room is equipped with coffee (nespresso)maschine and kettle as well as a mini bar with soft drinks. also an ipod docking station was available.
i don't really have anything else to say apart from that the room could have been a bit bigger. the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. the rooms were always very clean and we always got little chocolates each night. the beds were okay but not too comfortable..
I would definately stay here again and the location was great!",4,2014,05,21
115,Back again and not disappointed,Always a warm welcome from very helpful staff. I always try and stay here now when I visit London as the staff make a big effort and the location is so convenient. I liked the new juice bar which was great for a healthy smoothie for breakfast. Rooms can be small but for the money are very well appointed wi lovely toiletries and a robe,5,2014,05,21
115,Great hotel and friendly staff,"My wife and I stayed here for a night recently and we' were very impressed. The room was great! Very spacious, clean and to a high standard. The hotel bar is a great place for a quiet relaxing drink and the breakfast was great too.",5,2014,05,20
115,London staycation,"I booked this hotel on the recommendation of a friend, and was very impressed by the venue and staff. There was a great deal of attention to detail which is often overlooked in central London hotels.

The room was impeccably decorated and comfortable. Overall I was very impressed and intend to return at the next opportunity! ",5,2014,05,20
115,A charming and impressively run establishment,"I recently enjoyed a two night stay at The Bloomsbury, and I would thoroughly recommend the hotel. I am perpetually in and out of London hotels during the week for work commitments and am often confronted by mediocre service, average dining experiences and facilities which frankly do not justify the exorbitant prices that seem a prerequisite for these establishments.
The Bloomsbury market a pleasant change from these all too familiar experiences – while it is not cheap by any means, I found the level of service impeccable, the atmosphere to be friendly and inviting, and the bar and waiting staff to be helpful and attentive. Evidently, there is a management team in place who clearly recognise what is important to guests. The juicery in the Lobby was a particularly nice touch and I look forward to returning soon!",5,2014,05,19
115,Excellent hotel - 1st choice from now on,I stayed here for business and thought everything was fantastic. The hotel/room was very clean and if I did have any queries the lovely staff would be very understanding and quick to help me. I will be staying here in future after a wonderful 1st time. ,5,2014,05,19
115,Small Room But Perfectly Formed ....,"I stayed her on business this week, the room was quite small especially the bathroom.  However everything in there was top notch.  The bed was comfy and all the amenities were of top quality.  We had a great nights sleep.  Breakfast was also very relaxed and good choice, service was prompt and friendly.  My only criticism was the terrace in the afternoon we waited 45 minutes to get a drink and when they finally arrived the order was wrong.  The guy who served us was very professional but the place was defiantly understaffed.  Just one waiter for the whole terrace which was very busy.  Otherwise a perfect stay.  I would definitely stay here again",5,2014,05,16
115,Great location. Excellent service,"This is a very good hotel with a perfect central location. Rooms were large for London standards - my superior room on the 5th floor was surprisingly spacious, very quiet, faced the back ( so no views- which was fine) had windows that opened but good double glazing. Free water in the room, replenished on turn down service and free wifi. Towels and robes were in good condition - very comfortable beds.  All staff from check in to check out were impressively polite and helpful. One minor irritant was that the shower was not very powerful at all -  but it would not stop me returning. I didn't use any of the bars or restaurants. Highly recommended. ",4,2014,05,13
115,Exceptional Staff and Lovely Hotel,"I stayed here with my Husband for one night  while we celebrated our 21st wedding anniversary. We had tickets for Ronnie Scott's, which is a short walk away. All the staff we encountered were lovely, especially Louise at the front desk who enquired about the reason for our stay. When we were settled in our room a member of staff brought up 2 glasses of champagne & an anniversary card .This personal touch was so thoughtful and much appreciated! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The Hotel lobby smells gorgeous, the rooms are pleasantly decorated and clean. The breakfast was delicious & kept us going all day. Although quite pricey you definitely get what you pay for. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this great hotel.",5,2014,05,13
115,Great Stay in Central London,I stay here regularly when I travel with work and always love coming back! The staff are all really friendly and go above and beyond to help you feel at home! The rooms are comfortable and the location is hard to beat (steps away from the nearest tube station and a mere 10 minutes walk to Covent Garden!). I always recommend my friends stay here when they travel to London!,5,2014,05,13
115,Above and Beyond,"I stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel during a short business trip to London- I'm always sure to have a nice experience at the Bloomsbury. During this trip the hotel staff went above and beyond to make my stay special. During my early check-in, after a long-haul flight, I mentioned that the lobby smelled spectacular to the gentleman at the front desk. While I was getting settled into my room, a member of the staff brought me up a candle, the same candles that were lit in the lobby, and let me know that since I enjoyed it so much I could have one in my room during my stay. That bit of personalization made my day, and made my stay. I'll return to the Bloomsbury again and again for the great location, comfortable rooms and amazing service.",5,2014,05,11
115,Excellent staff and hotel,"Just spent 5 nights at the Bloomsbury-the staff is fantastic!  Everyone was wonderful. Special thanks to Brian, Mario and Abdul (Concierge), Maria & Estella (restaurant) & Adela at Front Desk.  The list could be longer but can't remember all of the names!  Hotel is very comfortable.  We always felt safe and well taken care of",5,2014,05,10
115,short stay,"Me and my partner stayed here last year for a short weekend whilst visiting London. The room was very clean and well presented. The staff were very polite, friendly and welcoming. Expensive but well worth it for the experience. very good location we took a taxi to the theatre how ever easy enough to walk. We also walked to Houston train station which took no longer than 15 minutes and was a enjoyable walk. Cant wait to visit again.",5,2014,05,09
115,Very classy central London hotel,"I popped in briefly to drop off my bags on the way to dropping my rental car back at the Euston Station Depot (not too far a walk) and while the staff seemed a little bit surprised, they were very accommodating and held my bags for me.  On my return I had a very warm welcome, it seemed all the staff new my name already - really nice.  At check-in there was a little joke about being a spy and from that point on the really friendly Adella and Ben called me Mr Bond.
The room was great, modern, classy and very well sized for London with all the right amenities and a large bathroom.  I met my colleague in the bar for a few drinks before dinner and had a great time.  The bar staff were very friendly and chatty and poured a mean martini and mojito.  When I returned to my room I was really pleasantly surprised to find a note from Adella and Ben and a voucher for a Bond style martini - really great touch, thanks guys!
I stayed for two nights and had a conference on site for two days.  The service was brilliant throughout, the conference room (The Library) was very cool and the food was top notch.  Overall a great stay in a fantastic location - I would definitely stay again!",5,2014,05,08
115,Superb Hotel in great location,"My wife and I returned for a two night stay and once again it didn't disappoint. A big thank you to Michael Neve and his attentive staff, you have a hotel to be proud of, nothing was too much trouble. This is a beautiful hotel, spotlessly clean in a fabulous location. Will look forward to a return visit. ",5,2014,05,07
115,Comfortable well located boutique hotel,"We stayed for a couple of nights in a standard room over the May bank holiday weekend. The room was spotlessly clean with a  comfortable King size bed and 32"" flat screen tv. We were well looked after during our stay by polite but not overbearing staff that made us feel very much at home. The Bloomsbury Is Ideally located for the best that London has to offer with loads of great attractions within walking distance.(The British Museum, Oxford St., Covent Garden and Theatre land are all on your doorstep) All in all a great good value west end choice.",5,2014,05,06
115,Small but perfectly formed,"Stayed here for my Sister-in-Law's birthday. The hotel is in a terrific position for access to the west end. We only had a 'standard room' so can't comment on the bigger rooms but the room we had was quite small (about on a par with a Holiday Inn) - the fixtures are better of course. 

I mentioned at check in that we were here for a birthday and when we returned to the room in the early evening to get ready for dinner my sis in law had a personalised birthday cake and card from the two receptionists. It was a really nice thing for the to do so I would like to mention Adella and Ben, thanks guys!

Would recommed this hotel but spend a bit more and get a bigger room.",4,2014,05,06
115,Don't let the looks fool you,"I have a long history with this hotel. It's always been my first choice in London whenever I'm there (about 2-3 times a year), but my last stay changed my impression completely. I stayed there for about 2 weeks in winter 2012 and a month in summer, and 6 nights with my partner in January 2014 for a New Year's getaway. 

There's no denying that the location of this hotel is definitely great. It's within walking distance from all major attractions; Leicester Square, Oxford Street, Soho and very accessible through major tube stations (Tottenham Court Road station is 3 mins away). 

The rooms are nicely decorated and very cozy. Very comfortable beds and luxurious bathrooms. 

However, the service of the hotel is probably the worst I've ever experienced for what I 
pay - especially the reception staff. On all my stays, the credit card machine doesn't seem to work properly.

First incident - Summer 2012: 
When I had to check out from my 28 night stay in Summer 2012, and after paying a huge bill for the room and in-room dining, there was a problem with my credit card as did not accept any transactions. On my way out, the bill was being settled but the credit card did not seem to work. There was about 120 pounds (out of 4500+ pounds that was already settled) that the card did not accept to process. I explained to the receptionist that my flight is in 2 hours and my friend is staying in the room for the night as I have already paid for it and he'd be happy to settle the rest of the payment. 
I was basically shouted at by the receptionist saying ""WE WANT THE MONEY NOW!, I'VE BEEN TRYING TO PROCESS YOUR CARD ALL DAY BUT IT'S NOT WORKING"". 

As my friend was sleeping in the room, I had to call my family to send their credit card details to pay the remaining amount. Again, the system did not accept the payment and I was blamed. Thankfully, the problem was in the hotel's payment system.
Another issue I faced during that trip is that they blocked the full amount of my stay on my credit card and did not release it until 2 weeks after I've checked out, which probably caused the whole problem.

Also, my GHA account (the loyalty program) was only credited for 10 nights, not the whole stay. 

Second incident - January 2014: 
This experience at this hotel has paled in comparison with the other hotels in the Group (the Marylebone). As a platinum GHA member, I did not feel very special upon check-in. Although the check-in staff were delightful, especially, Joelle, we were disappointed by a number of things not least the way in which the night manager seemed to dismiss our regular stays at GHA hotels for over 30 nights a year as relatively insignificant as compared with others who stay for months at a time. What we sought was a way to upgrade our room to a deluxe by paying extra and a complimentary upgrade to a suite by way of benefit from the platinum membership. But instead we were shown a series of extremely small deluxe rooms only one of which had the desired kingsize bed.

Having travelled for a long time, we settled for the room (that looks like a renovated attic) in order to rest only to find these things lacking:

- Hairs on the sheets of the bed behind the pillows
- No complimentary water
- No kettle
- No answer (just answerphone) from room service by telephone after having tried 5 times to reach them between 10pm and 1130pm
- No shower gel or conditioner in the room
- Not having been asked on check-in whether we wanted a newspaper
- A malfunctioning ipod dock with no cable
- A malfunctioning bedside reading lamp
- A malfunctioning nespresso machine

After emailing the day manager with our complaint, we received a call on 4th night (out of 6) offering us a different room. However, we didn't want to go through the trouble of packing and unpacking for a 48 hour stay. 

In conclusion, I'd recommend this hotel for ""in and out"" stays of 3-4 nights. It's nicely decorated and clean, but don't expect any special treatment or 5-star service for the overpriced rooms compared to its neighbours like the Radisson Edwardian.",3,2014,05,06
115,Superb attention to detail,"My wife and I,  plus my brother and his partner stayed here for a birthday celebration on the 5th of May. Our arrival was handled professionally with a smile and some appropriate humour as it was my wife's birthday. The rooms were spotlessly clean and the concierge attentive. We arrived back to ready ourselves for the evening, and we were surprised and delighted to find a lovely birthday card from the reception team with a generous portion of lemon cake. The towels had been replaced and the room given a tidy!
This is a very well run hotel, which isn't expensive for central London, and the staff are amazing. Highly recommended.",5,2014,05,06
115,Top Class,"My wife and I spent a 4 day city break at The Bloomsbury Hotel last week. Room was excellent, very comfortable, well equipped and fairly spacious (we had paid extra for a deluxe room). Staff were excellent, especially hostess at breakfast who remembered our names and greeted us personally each time she saw us. Breakfast was very good. Terrific location, just off Oxford Street and near Covent Garden / Soho. 

We will certainly return.",5,2014,05,04
115,Excellent city break at The Bloomsbury,"Lovely weekend in London staying at The Bloomsbury. Hotel bedrooms felt luxurious and very clean. An upmarket boutique hotel with all the staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms well equipped and the public areas were very impressive too. Would definitely return. Ideally situated for Covent Garden, theatres/museums and a great choice of restaurants.  Good location for sightseeing too.",5,2014,05,03
115,Can't fault it.,"I stayed as a single female. The service was excellent, bedroom very comfortable with a Nespresso machine. Good bathroom, with Aromatherapy Associates products. Free Wi-Fi. Try to get a deal including breakfast, as I did. the breakfast is very good. Ideal situation for the British Museum and only 5 mins or so to Covent Garden. Convenient for buses and Tottenham Court Road tube station. I'll definitely return.",5,2014,05,01
115,Nice experience,"Great hotel located 2 minutes from the British Museum and 15 minutes walking to Trafalgar Square. Very helpful and polite staff. Small rooms but fully equipped (there were even electric kettle, coffe machine, iron, slippers). And when I first entered the hotel I thought I got to some kind of palace).
I only did not like the stairs before the main enterance, as it is quite difficult to carry luggage and conquer those steps.
However, all in all it was great! Thank you!",5,2014,04,30
115,Wonderful hotel with fabulous service!,"A huge thank you to Michael Neve & his staff for a wonderful stay at this fabulous hotel. 5 of us had an overnight stay for a shopping trip to celebrate my daughters 21st birthday. The hotel is perfectly positioned just off Oxford St.. The service was impeccable , the hotel spotless, the rooms beautiful & the breakfast was just perfect. We would love to go back & stay again & could not recommend this hotel highly enough. Thank you again for a memorable stay!",5,2014,04,29
115,Long weekend,"Service was excellent, we were offered hot flannels on arrival and complimentary smoothly. Our room was very comfortable and the facilities and refreshments excellent including Nespresso machine.  This was a good location for our stay, we went to see the Jersey Boys at the Piccadilly Theatre which  was within walking distance. The British Museum, Covent Gardens, Big Ben, the London Eye, all within walking distance.  We didn't need to use the tube during our stay.  The Hotel staff were courteous and very helpful at all times. After busy days walking and sightseeing it was lovely to come back to the hotel to relax.  We had 2 evening meals in the restaurant which were delicious and the bar afterwards was very relaxing. Excellent Cocktails! We had a wonderful stay and would definitely recommend the Hotel.",5,2014,04,28
115,"Absolutely fantastic, enjoyed every minute of our stay !!!!!","This hotel was amazing and we had a wonderful stay. We stayed at this hotel to celebrate my fiancées birthday and we're delighted to find the hotel staff had made a great effort and had out a card and a (delicious) birthday cake in our room. The hotel staff were always happy and helpful. The rooms were beautiful, clean and modern with a marble en suite  bathroom. Our stay was incredible and we would definetly stay here again. Thank you to Bloomsbury Hotel for our lovely stay. ",5,2014,04,28
115,London Marathon Stay,"Stayed at four hotels during our ten day visit. Greenwich, Windsor and two in London. This hotel was a better experience than the hotel we stayed at on Park Lane. The staff was personable. The room was very clean and large for European standards. The workout room was good. There was even a fruit tray waiting for us upon check-in which was great as we had just finished the marathon. Good location for many activities. Quiet, which again is not always the case as many older hotels have poor sound quality between rooms and the street below. Definitely would stay again and recommend.",5,2014,04,27
115,Great location but .....,"Stayed there  for 5 days 
In my humble opinion it has pros and some cons which shouldn't be there for such expensive hotel 

1st pros : the hotel has a great location for the major shopping street Oxford st . Steps away from the Tottenham metro station.
They check the room twice daily to make up the bed and provide clean towels and tea bags if needed
The room aircondition work both cold and hot which was something important for me I leave in hot country and can't sleep if the room is cold

The breakfast was ok 

The hotel staff is very cheerful, helpful and polite 

Cons : they do check the room twice but the don't clean it from dust at all !!! The whole 5 days the dust accumulate on the bedside lambs and looked really disturbing, also the room was never vaccumed. There was a big spiderweb above the window which make me wondering every night is there a spider in the room ??
The last thing that I really hated and thanks God that I only noticed it in my last night other wise I was going to change the room or the hotel  ""the silvefish bug ""!!! (they usually leave in dusty areas). I hate those .... I found two of them wondering on the bathroom floor in my last night in the hotel !!!
I took photos for these cons but won't post them cause no need to do so 

In the morning during checking out I informed the reception guy about those bugs ... He didn't know what am talking about but he apologized to me for the inconvenience

",3,2014,04,26
115,First Time In This Excellent Hotel,"Stayed at The Bloomsbury for 3 nights and found it to be an excellent hotel.
Very efficient,friendly staff,tasteful décor,nice food,great location.
We usually stay in the Bloomsbury area but this is our first - but certainly not our last visit to The Bloomsbury.
Very comfortable stay.",5,2014,04,26
115,A nice pool of Tranquility,"The hotel is very nicely situated with good access to all the major shopping attractions of Oxford street etc. just visiting with my wife for a couple of nights as a surprise treat by her for my birthday. On arrival we were warmly greeted and offered the potential to upgrade to a superior room at a price that seemed possibly unecessary but reasonable which we at first declined. On being shown our room it seemed somewhat ""compact"" (as well as minus one bathrobe) so we elected to view the alternatives which were larger by degrees and settled for one with a seperate shower but a limited view of the interior of the building and a little dingy. However the space was much more welcome as were two bathrobes.
Everything appeared clean and tastefully decorated although the flatscreen tv did have faulty pixel lines down the centre of the screen but it was no biggy and we chose not to fuss. On the first night the management kindly left a birthday card and some very nice cake in our room :).
We chose to eat out as I was also seeing family in London but my impression was it came at a premium which reflects Its classy ambience. I also never tried the fitness centre and I cant say if it had a pool. The free wi-fi was very welcome. On departure day we received two housekeeping visits 8.10 am and 9.30 am but checkout was 11.00 am and although the staff were apologetic it felt a little hasty and mildly annoying. When we finally checked out there did seem to be some discrepency with the eventual upgrade charge we paid and that which we were expecting. This was apparently to be ""investigated"" and whilst most everything about our stay was couched with courtesy it did leave one feeling a trifle flustered and ""wanting"" particularly in regards to the troubles my wife undertook in arranging our visit. I think I would stay there again but maybe ensure I was getting the right room at a price that did not end up surprising me.",4,2014,04,26
115,Fantastic location,"We stayed at the hotel for one night, choosing it for the location so near to the British Museum.  The ambiance is so tranquil you would not believe you were in the centre of a large city.  
We arrived at 12 noon, and to our surprise were able to check in straight away. Our room was quiet, as requested, very pleasant with a small but perfect bathroom with lovely large fluffy towels. We had the full breakfast, and were impressed with the choice and quality of the food, especially the fresh papaya and yummy yoghurt.  We also had an evening meal in the restaurant (as we had been out walking all day and didn't want to go out again.) The restaurant was too quiet, but the quality of the food was good though we felt the portions too small.
The staff in all areas were very helpful and friendly.",5,2014,04,25
115,Brilliant experience!,The Bloomsbury is in a fantastic location. The staff provide a wonderful experience for all with ease and pleasure. Rooms are very clean and attention to detail is obviously important. We had a fantastic stay and will definitely return on our next trip to London.,5,2014,04,25
115,Great hotel ! Not my last time here !,"I stayed here just one night before the Easter but i can tell you that the hotel is not very big and this is important if you want to feel special guest, close to amneties but a poor breakfast if you chose a continental breakfast.",4,2014,04,24
115,great location,"Amazing location! We loved this hotel because it was just around the corner from a tube station and we could walk/travel to anywhere in the city easily.  There are great little takeaway restaurants/cafes right on the street as well as endless shopping and dining within walking distance.  It was clean, nice, and just the perfect place for a London getaway.  The rooms are small unless you do an upgrade (well, small from my American perspective!) We found a deal online that was less expensive.",5,2014,04,22
115,Fantastic !!! :),My Husband and I stayed at the Bloomsbury for 2 nights. Our room was very clean and spacious. The staff are all very nice and go out of their way to make you feel welcome. The food in the Bloomsbury restaurant is absolutely delicious!! We had a fantastic time and will be returning.,5,2014,04,20
115,Birthday trip,"We booked this hotel as part of a holiday to celebrate my girlfriend's 30th birthday. Upon arrival our taxi door was opened for us and our bags whisked out straight inside. The hot towels at check in were a nice touch. Our room was lovely and our bags brought up to us by Abdul the concierge. He asked if we were there for a special occasion and arranged for a birthday cake (lit candle and all) and free drinks to be brought to us. A lovely way to begin our celebrations. The staff were lovely and friendly and the scented candles in the hall meant that the hotel smelled great. Situated in a great location, we will most definitely stay here again when we return to London.",5,2014,04,19
115,Very nice hotel - Great location!,"Stayed in this hotel over the weekend and it was a great hotel. 
The location is perfect and so ideal - close to both Oxford Street and Convent garden. 
The hotel itself is very clean and the rooms are lovely, would recommend.",4,2014,04,15
115,A real pleasure to at The Bloomsbury,"Great location, a short walk to Covent Garden, Soho and Oxford Street. Friendly staff that seemed to know what I wanted before I asked. A special thank you to the staff organising the breakfasts, will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,04,15
115,An perfect example of how a hotel should be,"Booked this to stay in prior to London Marathon as it was a convenient location in central London.

We arrived several hours early, but had a pleasant greeting and no issues with early check in.

Rooms are stylishly decorated, with good facilities, bed was comfortable, bath and shower in room. We called reception as we wanted more coffee pods and they were at our door within a couple of minutes.

Knowing I was running the Marathon reception even called the room to offer a breakfast to go and complimentary drink. A nice touch.

The hotel is beautifully decorated and has a great ambiance with Jazz playing and scented candles. As other reviewers have noted it's a calm environment after the hustle of central London.

Staff were happy to hold our cases after check out and service was consistently good and friendly.

We wish we'd have had longer here to make the most of the juice bar and restaurant.
Our favourite London hotel to date.",5,2014,04,14
115,Great Hotel in Bloomsbury,"This is the best hotel at which we have stayed in London.  (See my review entitled ""Minority Report"" about the Egerton, which we disliked.). The hotel is on a quiet street, very close to the British Museum, and within walking distance of Covent Garden.  The room was large, quiet, clean, and well-appointed.

Our fee included breakfast, and the breakfast menu and buffet were outstanding.  (Never equalled for us in England, and rarely elsewhere.)

All of the staff were friendly, but of special note were the two hostesses at breakfast--Maria and Estelita.

The Bloomsbury is the hotel you want if you are in London!",5,2014,04,10
115,Very comfortable stay,Stayed for one night and didn't really spend a huge amount of time in the hotel but check in/out was smooth with very friendly staff and the room itself was spacious and comfortable with everything I needed and all in very good condition. Considering it's central location it was very quiet. My only personal preference would be for a proper duvet and bigger pillows but it didn't stop me having a good nights sleep.,4,2014,04,09
115,Outstanding Hotel,On entering the Bloomsbury Hotel I felt a very warm welcome from the very attentive staff. It proved to be a very calming environment which is always a bonus when on business in London. I will certainly have this hotel on top of my list for my next trip.,5,2014,04,08
115,Quintessential understated English style,"Stayed for 1st time here on a recent Sat nite out in London. Having stayed in more central London hotels over the years than I care to recall, finally we've found one which I'd be more than happy to return to (without having to spend excessively)
Lovely welcoming lobby area decorated in rich warm reds, & immediately makes you feel as though you're staying somewhere really rather special. We had a well appointed room with high quality furnishings, spotlessly clean & very light due to huge windows, which appear to be present in almost every room.
Really excellent staff, especially the ever friendly concierge's where nothing was too much trouble.  
Slick check-in & check-out - really like the invoice-under-the-door on morning of checkout - allows you to check over your bill at your leisure rather than hurriedly checking it over at reception - nice touch, & simple but good idea to simplify your stay.
Didn't eat at hotel as we had restaurant reservation with friends.
Taxi's always available right outside the hotel, & great location for short walk to Tottenham Court Rd Tube station, & Tottenham Court Rd car park too where a hotel-sponsored discount is available.
All in all - really very good - will definitely be back when we're next in central London again.
Well done The Bloomsbury !",5,2014,04,07
115,Excellent location,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is in an excellent location, we did not have to use the public transport at all as everything was within walking distance,  The service at the hotel was second to none, friendly staff always happy to help.   We were greeted with lovely smiles from the moment we walked through the doors,nothing was too much trouble.  I loved the smell of the hotel, they had perfumed candles burning throuhout the hotel lobby and the decor was beautiful.  In our room we had nice little touches, dressing gowns and slippers plus amazingly an umberella which is always good in our lovely English Weather..  A nice little touch when checking out we were offered a bottle of water and they offered to look after our bags whilst we finished our sightseeing of the area.  I truly think this hotel should be a 5 star.",5,2014,04,07
115,A highly recommended Hotel,"A wonderful hotel in the heart of London's Theatre Land. A warm welcome from the reception with a welcome healthy drink from the 'juicery'. Some of the most attentive and courteous staff I have encountered. Spotlessly clean hotel, quiet, excellent food, enormous bed, TV with all channels,nice touches, even a large umbrella had it been raining. An expresso machine in the room and adequate tea/coffee making facilities. WIFI,room service, in store fridge,safe,hairdryer etc. Yes I would return to this hotel without any doubt.Very handy for the British Museum and all the theatres . An abundance of bars, restaurants and a London Red Bus every minute to the whole of London and railway stations and the underrground. Yes ,a perfect hotel in a perfect location.",5,2014,04,04
115,Absolutely wonderful.,"The Bloomsbury Hotel should be a 5 star. From the moment you walk through the doors and are greeted by the concierge you are aware that this is not just another hotel.
This is a unique and individual experience with excellent food and service and attention to detail. The hotel staff are very polite and nothing was too much trouble for them. The hotel was very clean and tidy and the room was excellent. We only stayed one night but left wishing we could stay longer.
You must try this wonderful hotel.
We will definitely be back again!

115,Blooming lovely,"We booked the Bloomsbury when visiting London for a friend's birthday and were very impressed by both it's splendour (to us provincials it seemed VERY swanky) and its warm welcome.  Literally a stone's throw from Tottenham Court Road at one end of the street and the British Museum at the other, if you are doing touristy London it's very happily situated.  We arrived on a sunny Saturday afternoon in March having nabbed a bargain deal on the internet so were very pleasantly surprised to find a quality hotel with unerringly polite and helpful door and desk staff.  We were on a budget so didn't check out the cocktail bar (although the voucher for a free cocktail was a nice touch) and headed up to our room - closely followed by the doorman with our bags.  Nothing seemed to be too much trouble.  We were located up on the sixth floor in a compact but well-appointed room.  Tasteful decoration, lovely modern bathroom, and the usual TV, tea and coffee making facilities as well as a nice view of the Centre Point Tower (no, really - we thought it was cool) meant we were happy bunnies.  We slept in a very comfortable bed and despite the hotel being busy, weren't disturbed at all by other guests coming and going.  We didn't stop for breakfast as we'd spied an attractive looking diner opposite and headed there (VQ - also recommended) but having stayed once I would most definitely choose this hotel again - it's not often that you experience such a quality hotel in this price range in the capital, and this one is well worth a return visit.",4,2014,04,02
115,"Elegant, friendly and relaxed- perfect for he special weekend I'd planned for my husband's birthday!","Thank you to The Bloomsbury Hotel for a lovely stay and for making my husband's special birthday even more so! We didn't get a free upgrade when I asked but they sent two glasses of bubbly and a desert with 'happy birthday' written on the plate to our room a few minutes after our arrival- fab! 

The location is great especially for shows. The hotel staff are polite and accommodating and the hotel itself is clean, elegant and very comfortable. The Rooms are well decorated, it's a nice boutique hotel with no 'chain' feel to it. There are also nice touches like espresso coffee maker. We would definitely stay there again! ",5,2014,04,02
115,Stay here...,"Superb hotel which I've had the pleasure of staying at on business many times over the last 3 years. The staff are friendly and attentive, the rooms contemporary and the food excellent. Malaka - the duty night manager is the bar to which every hotel manager should be assessed and Maria who manages the Restaurant provides excellent service with a smile, even at 7am!! 

If your considering the hotel for a business or private function the George V suite at the end of the corridor is by far the best!

Highly Recommend this hotel 

P.s It also smells great - You'll understand what I mean when you go there!!",5,2014,04,02
115,Amazing,"This is a really superb hotel. Every amenity you could need is there and the staff couldn't be nicer. I almost don't want to write this review so that the hotel isn't booked next time I'm in London. But alas, they treated us so well that I can't withhold the nice worlds. Thank you all for a very nice stay!",5,2014,04,01
115,"Hotel was great, bar - even better","My experience at the Bloomsbury was an absolute pleasure starting from the time I checked in and lasting up until the very moment I checked out. The staff was extremely friendly and courteous and really knew how to make a guest feel welcome. My room was furnished with every imaginable amenity and the bed felt great to sleep in. I think the best aspect of our stay though was becoming acquainted with the resident bartender, Joel. My associate and I were traveling on business and whenever we stopped by, he made us feel as if we were at home. The quality of his drinks could only have been matched by his warming personality and we will be sure to stop by there the next time we're in town, even if we don't happen to be staying at the hotel!",5,2014,04,01
115,Highly recommend!,"We have just returned from a lovely weekend in London and stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel-from the moment we arrived we were made to feel really welcome and the staff were very friendly and chatty and took an interest in what our plans were for the weekend. The room was very comfortable, the bed was lovely,the mixed nuts in the mini bar were amazing, and the full english breakfast was the perfect remedy for a hangover!! Oh and my husband was particularly impressed that there was the Sky Sports channel..... 
Will definitely recommend!",5,2014,04,01
115,A friendly top-notch hotel with faultless service,"Just returned from an excellent one night stay at The Bloomsbury, and must say we were extremely impressed with the hotel, the staff, and the service we received. Our stay was part of my 50th Birthday celebrations, and my wife and I could not have received a better service from start to finish. We were spending the whole day in London, so arrived at 9.00am to off-load our luggage, and were immediately offered an early check-in there and then, and given vouchers for complimentary cocktails, in recognition of my Birthday. 
Having spent the day sight-seeing, we returned for dinner in the Landseer Restaurant, and once seated were offered complimentary champagne (again a nice touch). When our smiling and courteous waitress accidently tipped my glass over, I was brought a replacement without hesitation. The wonderful meal was topped off with an exquisitely made surprise Birthday Cake, which made a delicious dessert. And breakfast the next day was amazing too.
On a rare night away without the kids, we were made to feel totally at home and relaxed  and I really cannot recommend this place highly enough. Well done to all the staff.",5,2014,04,01
115,Friendly service,"I stop at the Bloomsbury on a regular basis for work and I can without question recommend this hotel to anyone. 
I stay in many hotels all over the uk and the Bloomsbury is my favourite by far. 
All the staff are polite and welcominge especial Joel the barman who made it a pleasure to spend time there.",5,2014,03,31
115,Consistent excellence,"We've stayed in many London hotels over the years, but rarely do we stay in the same one twice. However, when we checked into the Bloomsbury for the first time, last year, it didn't feel like any other hotel we'd stayed in before. We now consider it our London base and it's our first choice whenever we are in the capital. The staff are always helpful and friendly. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the concierge have, over our visits, sourced west end tickets, hired a chauffeur driven car and provided advice and local information. The Landseer restaurant and bar is a nice place to unwind each night with an old fashioned and discuss the day.
The central location of the hotel is ideal for the British Museum and Oxford Street. A short walk in any direction and you will find yourself amongst countless London attractions.",5,2014,03,31
115,"""Very comfortable, calm hotel, in central London""","The Bloomsbury on Great Russell Street is my preferred hotel for business when I am in London. As soon as you walk in the door it's an oasis of calm and comfort. The staff are excellent and extremely pleasant and always make me feel welcome. I love the decor in the rooms. After a busy day it's calming and organic and somewhere you want to be. The coffee machine in the rooms is fantastic. It's the first thing I do when I get in. A 'good' cup of coffee and a few moments to catch my breath. One of the major advantages for me is the peace and quiet.  I have never stayed in a room where noise was an issue and this is very important to me when I have early mornings and long days. The take away express breakfast is a great advantage and always good. The hotel itself is very central with public transport links 2 mins from the hotel. In fact, you have everything you need right there on your door step. I would certainly recommend this hotel for a stay, whether that be business or pleasure, and I hope to return in the not so distant future.",5,2014,03,31
115,Classic english style,"Great Hotel.  Very convenient location in the city centre and the British museum is not far from here.All main sightseeing attractions are in the walk distance. Comfortable rooms with all necessary equipment ( tea,coffee machine,hairdryer,good quality cosmetic),cosy bed and the silence that invites you to have a good sleep.The staff is very professional and friendly,delicious breakfasts.I  have traveled a lot and I can compare this place with others: it's a really good hotel for business trip.Hope be back on my vacation in the future.",5,2014,03,30
115,"Husband Birthday, Romano L.","We are regular guest at the Bloomsbury hotel and especially at the Landseer Restaurant & Bar and we are always very pleased with the service and quality of the food.
We came on the 27th of March for my husband birthday and as usual we had a lovely time, the waitress Estelita was very nice and friendly, very attentive at our needs. The Chef Paul made a wonderful and delicious chocolate/raspberry cake that made my husband very happy and made the lunch very special. So thank you and for sure we will be back very soon for the Jazz night in May !",5,2014,03,29
115,Excellent hotel,"I have stayed in Bloomsbury at Great Russel street in March 2014. 
Location of the hotel is very comfortable. The British Museum is in a 2 minutes walk. You can get to the Tube in 2 minutes. There are many bus stops nearby the hotel. Bus 24 goes to the Trafalgar square and Westminster (so You can get to best tourist attractions just in 15 minutes), bus 73 travels from Oxford street, and if You are not mind to walk, You can definitely get to many attractions in London just by walking. 
There is a pharmacy, souvenir shops and a small supermarket near the hotel as well.
Hotel is very clean, and very stylish. The room was small, however very clean. There was a coffee machine in room, kettle (with ea and coffee), ironing desk, hair drier and all the amenities which are usually present in any good hotel. 
The view from the room- well I can say that it was great, however, it was not bad as well
The breakfast was very well prepared if choose from menu. 
All staff in hotel was very assisting, smiling always and trying to do their best to be supportive
I liked this hotel, and would recommend for those people who are not on a budget and want to stay in a good and quiet place",4,2014,03,27
115,Excellent hotel close to many major London attractions,"We recently took our 7 year old grandson for a weekend in London, this hotel was central to most of the things we wanted to see. In addition the hotel was welcoming, clean and the staff were friendly and welcoming and went out of their way to ensure we were happy with everything. Would definitely use this hotel again and it was very quiet, unusually so for such a busy area.",5,2014,03,27
115,Excellent service and very friendly staff,"My wife asked me to come along as she is going on a business trip to London. I had reservations at first but once I met the friendly and very professional staff I have no regrets. Generous breakfast, excellent service and a great location make this an excellent place to stay whether on pleasure or business trip. We highly recommend it! 

Don't forget to take some time to try the Landseer Restaurant and Bar with their great staff (i.e. Maria and Estelita). Their concierge was also very helpful in assisting us to get around and see the attractions in London.",5,2014,03,26
115,Outstanding,"I can honestly say we have been amazed at our time at this hotel. To get such a personal and friendly hotel in the centre of London is rare. From the moment we arrived outside we were made to feel so welcome in a genuine way. It was my husbands 40th Birthday treat and  from the reception onwards he was congratulated, we had complimentary drinks and cake. I can honestly say we cannot wait to return, I can't imagine staying anywhere else after our first visit here. Thank you to all at The Bloomsbury.",5,2014,03,25
115,I hope to return,"There's nothing but accolades for the Bloomsbury Hotel.  Located within walking distance of many business and tourist destinations, the hotel is welcoming, immaculate, and staffed by capable, eager-to-please professionals.  The breakfast buffet is generous and varied and the dinner menu equally appealing.  Admittedly, the standard hotel room is petite, but not surprising for London (or New York or Paris, for that matter).   I hope to stay there again.",5,2014,03,25
115,Great hotel for business and pleasure,"I stayed here with friends all going to a rugby match in Twickenham and mixed some business in the trip. It has been a few years since I've been in London so was delighted to find this hotel. Great location for walking and beside a main tube line. The staff were excellent and always friendly and helpful. Our room was on the top floor but very comfortable and quiet and included a bath and a shower in the very modern spotless bathroom. Breakfast was a highlight, an excellent selection of food including healthy options. It extended until 11oclock and we lingered both mornings of our stay. Looking forward to getting back to London just to stay here...",5,2014,03,24
115,Janet R,"We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by the pleasant door staff and this set the tone for our visit. All the staff throughout the hotel were fantastic, helpful, polite and nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were excellent and the breakfast the best we have had in any Hotel we have stayed in. Can't wait to visit again.",5,2014,03,23
115,Couple of Hiccups - but................,"The first time I visited was on business and I couldn't wait to go back to celebrate my 50th birthday with my husband.  We arrived early but was able to check in - ladies on reception were very helpful.  However, when we entered the room it was quite uninspiring and had twin beds!! not what we wanted when we expected a king or Queen size.  My husband went down to Reception and we were allocated the next room which was not as lovely as the first time I stayed but none the less very nice, only one bathrobe though and 3 nespresso pods? It appeared the room was ready for a single person, but, these were only niggles and not enough to complain about, we weren't in London to spend a lot of time in the room.  We did ask if we could turn off the fridge as it made a very loud noise which would have been very annoying eventually.  When we arrived back to the room after a night out, the fridge had been turned off and there were rose petal spread over the bed and in the bathroom with candles.  Lovely touch and unexpected.

The next morning as a surprise my husband had arranged a bottle of champagne and chocolates to arrive to the room at 8.00am which didn't arrive and he was really annoyed and quite upset as it was something he had wanted to do for me while opening my presents. On our way to breakfast my husband went to see Reception to complain to be told that they had been delivered to the wrong room, which apparently was the room were should have been given in the first place as it was a lovely room (no idea as we didn't get to see it).  I told him not to worry about it these things happen and I wasn't going to let it spoil my day.  During breakfast the lady who had served us came to the table with two glasses of champagne and a lovely birthday cake I guess to make up for earlier which was really appreciated.

We arrived back to the room in the afternoon to be greeted with chocolates and a birthday card from the hotel - again really lovely and to top it off when getting ready for the theatre in the evening, there was a knock at the door and was greeted by 3 members of staff with a bottle of champagne on ice, a lovely cake with a candle, surrounded by fruit and 'Happy Birthday' written in strawberry sauce with the staff singing happy birthday.  This was totally unexpected and so lovely the earlier hiccups totally forgotten.  The staff had more than made up for it.  (Didn't get any names unfortunately).

I wasn't looking forward to this birthday, but the hotel made it so memorable that it turned out to be the best day and I am so grateful to all the staff who made it really special.

Special mention to the concierge who are so polite and a credit to the hotel, on departure we were asked if we wanted them to store our luggage as we had the full day in London before our train home.  

Fantastic service, lovely hotel and amazing staff - thank you for everything you did,  we will be back.",5,2014,03,21
115,Always great,"I had a couple of issues with their card reader and room key not working on arrival, but as ever the staff could not do enough for you. 

Still my best hotel to stay in when in London, hard to explain , but it just had a great great feel about the place when you stay. .

Thanks

Peter",5,2014,03,21
115,First Class Experience,"Very welcoming, courteous, forwardcoming staff, comfortable rooms, beautiful common areas. Very good breakfast menu. Good restaurant and light meal offer in the Bar. A true welcome home experience. 
Close to Tottenham Court subway station. Walking distance to British Museum on one side and Oxford Street shopping area to the other side.
",5,2014,03,20
115,Trade show,"Ideal location as only short walk from tube. Parks nearby with all amenities at short distance
. Food in restaurant is good but slighly expensive. Rooms are plush and welcoming. Will visit again when opportunity arises",4,2014,03,19
115,A special hotel,"This was my first stay at the Bloomsbury.  The staff there, from the doormen, to the front desk, to the wait staff ... were excellent and friendly. Kashif at the door, was not only helpful, but made the stay feel a bit like home every time I ran into him.  

The decor was well cared for and comfortably elegant.  The room though a bit small and not inexpensive (both are true across London), was quiet and very comfortable.  The food in the hotel was excellent as well.  For me, the location was perfect, as well as being easily accessible to the Underground.  All in all, I fully intend to stay there again, when the opportunity arises.

Thank you Bloomsbury for the service and treatment.",5,2014,03,19
115,Nice effort and great outcome.,"Second time staying at this property in London and I have to say I have noticed changes upon  my initial comments of slow check in and some lapse on the cleaning of rooms. Everything was taken care of quick and without delay. Grounds are perfect,service is outstanding and in general rooms are very well appointed (loved the Nespresso machines on each room).

It's a great pleasure to pay the luxury of this hotel when you exactly get what you pay for.
Congratulations to the front desk team and concierge (OUTSTANDING SERVICE)",5,2014,03,18
115,Lovely hotel with a few little niggles,"Very friendly welcome by receptionists and concierge, also notably a lovely aroma every time we entered the lobby/reception area with top class candles emitting the most fresh fragrance.
We had a standard room which was furnished with good quality tables, chairs, drapes etc..however the room had no drawer space which is a most basic requirement in an hotel room.
If we had have been there more than our 2 nights our extra t shirts, underwear etc. would have had no place to be stored, pretty basic needs here mind. There was actually a wall with space for a set of drawers that could have been put there, which was under utilised to say the least. The fridge was too noisy when it was in its cool mode adding to the niggle of no drawer space and making it a bit of an effort to get to sleep.
Great quantities of coffee, tea and a fresh coffee maker were lovely adittions to the room.
Having said this, the bathroom was also excellently laid out, with ample space and toiletries.
The room was also quietly positioned with hardly any sound to be heard from a very nicely decorated corridor with thick carpets nulling the sounds of walking feet going past.
Breakfasts were lovely, all of the usual continental stuff plus a fantastic quality full English was served. They do get this very right, all set out very well and easy to access.
I would stay here again , although I would pay more for a superior room which hopefully will be better designed than the standards.
A great hotel in a great location for a 5 to 10 minute walk to the west end.",4,2014,03,17
115,The Bloomsbury Hotel London,"Have just spent a weekend in The Bloomsbury Hotel London for my husband's birthday. From the moment we arrived until we left nothing was too much trouble, the staff were friendly and welcoming. A birthday cake was in the room when we checked in and after dinner, which was delicious, a complimentary glass of bubbly was delivered to our table. The hotel is well placed for Covent garden, theatres,British museum and shopping, would highly recommend it.",5,2014,03,16
115,Perfect Location,"A perfect hotel and perfect location for us. A very warm welcome upon arrival, seemless check in by friendly staff. Excellent service in the bar and restaurant and within easy walking distance for Theatre land.
Would definately go back again. :)",5,2014,03,16
115,Very Special Birthday weekend in the Bloomsbury,"We recently travelled to London with my son for his 14th Birthday and to see Arsenal in the FA Cup Quarter finals. Staying at the Bloomsbury really made this extra special and in addition Arsenal won 4-1! 
The chef made an Arsenal cake which was left in our room and was such a wonderful surprise on our return from the match. For the minute we arrived - the staff really took great care of us and nothing was too much trouble for them. The hotels is in a fantastic location and we would very strongly recomend it for its comfort, charms and top class staff.",5,2014,03,11
115,Excellent indeed!,"My wife and I stayed over friday and saturday nights recently. From check-in to departure our whole experience was absolutely great. All of the staff, without exception, are welcoming, friendly, professional and helpful. We had the full breakfast menu and the choice of cooked plates was very good for variety and quality. Between us over the two days we had the flu english, eggs Benedict and the Japanese breakfast. All were well prepared with good quality ingredients. As is usual for London the hotel drinks were pricey but there is a wide choice, again of quality.  We didn't eat from the restaurant or bar evening menus but they looked good.
Our room was one of their superior doubles on a side wall. It was spacious and comfortable with good facilities, including a nespresso machine, and was totally silent - no street noise, no neighbour noise. Perfect!. One small issue we had with the design of the bathroom tap was that you can't get the small kettle under the tap to fill it with water for a cup of tea! We had a complimentary water as well as a fridge of other soft drinks. 
Overall a lovely, fine quality stay. We had a great weekend enhanced by our stay here.",5,2014,03,10
115,Brilliant,"Check in was very quick and efficient, staff all had a smile and were very helpful. The location is very hard to beat, as everything was within walking distance.

All the staff provided excellent customer service and a friendly approach which was really appreciated. Hotel amenities were first class and our superior room was well furnished, presented excellently and maintained well throughout our stay. Thanks to everyone for a super stay",5,2014,03,09
115,Nice Hotel,"For a large hotel, it had a very friendly and warm feel to the public areas. It was extremely well maintained and great attention had been paid to outlooks from windows into internal spaces ensuring that these were pleasant.",4,2014,03,08
115,Fabulous,"Great hotel booked it through another agent, hotel plus /show. 
Was pleasantly surprised hotel was above all expectations great location close to amenities lovely and cosy. 
Mario the door man GREAT guy a+++++",5,2014,03,06
115,EXCELLENT AND MORE,"Staff and service were exceptional where nothing was too much trouble. Always and everywhere a smile and a greeting. The hotel is perfectly situated for ""the West End"" shopping, Theatre Land, underground and more. The rooms are quiet and exceptionally well furnished. The hotel is modern, very well designed and decorated with all comforts associated. We found breakfast and dinner to be top class with perfect service. Will come again for sure.",5,2014,03,06
115,Couldn't ask for anymore,"Just arrived back from a stay at this hotel and we were beyond impressed with the hotels efforts to go the extra mile. I booked a standard room through the website getaroom.com and although this website has many bad reviews it was roughly half the price of the nearest offering. I minimised risk by paying on a credit card and confirming the booking with the hotel the next day ( I had no problems with this). I also made the hotel aware I was going to ask my now fiancée to marry me whilst staying at the hotel. On telling them this they responded by saying they would do everything to make our stay as special as possible and they really did. Our room was upgraded, after I proposed we returned to find rose petals, candles, a bottle of prosseco, strawberries and chocolate and a card congratulating us ( good thing she said yes). I really can't praise their efforts enough and would recommend this hotel to anyone! Oh and also you can walk to the majority of London's best attractions saving you lots on travel costs.",5,2014,03,03
115,"Fantastic staff, great location","Greeted with a warm welcome. A home from home. Great location. Everything is in easy reach. Beautiful rooms , great breakfast. Dinner was fabulous , I highly recommend the lamb, really tasty. 
The staff here are warm and genuine. They are a credit to the hotel always ready with a big hello and smile . In particular Brian at the concierge desk, who has a great knowledge of the city and everything needed to enjoy your stay in this wonderful city. 
Thanks for an amazing stay!",5,2014,03,02
115,Top notch service and perfect location,"This was my first stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel and I will no doubt book the same hotel when I visit London next time. The room was spotlessly clean and elegantly decorated, complimentary Wifi and impeccable service. I have never experienced such devoted hotel staff ever before. They were very helpful with all of my questions and enquiries. Delicious breakfast. 
2 mins walk to nearest tube station (Tottenham Court Road) and Oxfort Street - the perfect location for both business and pleasure. No tube changes to get to Liverpool Street/Stansted Express makes this a great location if you travel to/from Stansted Airport.
I'm already looking forward to my next stay!",5,2014,02,28
115,A business hotel with great service ,I've heard good things about this hotel and finally tried it. The staff was happy to accommodate me into a room even though I arrived way too early for check-in. The first room I got wasn't to my liking (near service area and too far from lift) but they were happy to accommodate me and changed a room. Wifi was excellent throughout the hotel. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept on. A great hotel especially for weary business travellers! ,4,2014,02,27
115,"Wonderful, Romantic and Great location","My girlfriend and I went to London for 5 days, and decided to stay at The Bloomsbury. Great decision! We were welcome with champagne and roses on the bed and bath top. The staff were so gently and asked constantly if they could do anything better for us. The breakfast was wonderful, and so was the service. The room got cleaned, up to three times a day, which made the experience better. We'd recommend The Bloomsbury for everyone who wants the best location in the heart of London, wants luxury and an romantic atmosphere! It's worth every penny!",5,2014,02,27
115,Lovely hotel,"This was a lovely hotel situated in a central location. The British Museum and the Tottenham Court Road tube station are only ~ 1 block away. Restaurants, pubs, and theaters of Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus, and Covent Garden are also an easy walk from the hotel and the tube makes any other attraction easily accessible at a reasonable cost. We stayed for 5 nights in a standard room. Overall, the room was clean, tastefully decorated, and quiet. This is central London and our room was small (as you might expect in NYC). The bathroom was also lovely, but again, small and difficult to navigate with two people (if makes for a comical exercise for a second person to try to retrieve an item when the bathroom is already occupied). In retrospect, I would recommend upgrading to a larger room, especially if you are staying more than 2-3 nights – we found it difficult to navigate around the room with our two suitcases given the limited closet and floor space.  Additional wall hooks along the long wall opposite the bed would be an appreciated addition, especially for bulky coats which are difficult to fit in the closet. Wireless internet is provided and we had no difficult with access; there are also two computers and printers for use in the lobby. We never enjoyed the hotel restaurant although we often stopped at the bar downstairs for a nightcap and were pleased with the selection and service. Overall, we would not hesitate to stay here again, but would likely opt for a larger room. 

Additional information that might be of help:

If traveling from Heathrow, it is approximately an hour by tube to the hotel (with 1 transfer). You will have to navigate steps; if you have physical limitations, I would not recommend this option. Otherwise, this is the least expensive (and very easy) option at less than 6€/person. 

For first time visitors, pubs in central London close at 11-12, even on weekends. This made the hotel bar a much appreciated option given its late last call.

A related point to above: this is central London and many commute into the city. As a result, restaurants (just as pubs) close relatively early. On a positive note, for those preferring to eat later in the evening (~9pm) we found reservations were rarely needed. 

For tourists, do take advantage of the 2-4-1 offer by the National Rail Service for many popular attractions. Details are available on a number of tripadvisor forums.",4,2014,02,26
115,Averil H Exquiste Weekend Stay,"Great weekend was had in the Bloomsbury, brilliant location for all attractions, the staff were most helpful and friendly, the room was amazing and quiet.  We enjoyed a superb meal in the hotel restaurant.",5,2014,02,25
115,excellent,"I enjoyed the stay in the bloomsbury; the location is perfect. the hotel is nicely decorated, nice restaurant and bar. the rooms are perfectly equipped with nespresso, tea maker and iron. excellent staff.",5,2014,02,24
115,Wonderful weekend stay.,"We were so very well looked after it was unbelievable. Outstanding room- we were upgraded, gift of fresh fruit in the room. Quiet and peaceful which more than made up for the last time we were there when we complained about noise from the hotel's heating/ air con system which had the master unit outside our room. The staff are all fantastic - so well trained, the bar manager spent a lot of time on an American couple and not us on Sat evening- where were our nibbles? But a small point. Great breakfast!",5,2014,02,23
115,Fantastic hotel - better than 5 stars!!,"I stay at this hotel twice a year for a week or more on company business with colleagues of mine.  From the time your foot hits the entry way and the bellman opens the doors to greet you, there is nothing but first class that comes your way.  The staff are all top notch professionals; they treat you with respect and go out of their way to help you.  The food is extremely good here and the rooms are wonderful.  I 've stayed in the suite #312 and it's marvelous.  I've stayed at other hotels who call themselves first class or 5 stars and they don't even come close to what the Bloomsbury has to offer. When my colleagues and I come to London, we don't even think about staying anywhere else.  You are in the center of everything and an easy walk to restaurants, theater, shopping etc.",5,2014,02,22
115,My new home away from home,"From friendly, helpful staff to immaculate (if somewhat smallish) rooms, The Bloomsbury is my new favourite hotel in London. 

From the moment I checked in at 8:30 in the morning a very helpful staff were eager to ready a room for me and ensure that I was comfortable. Abdul in concierge went above and beyond to find the location for a conference I was attending and his warm smile and genuine greeting made just walking through the lobby something to look forward to.

The rooms were spotless and modern with a minimalist decor. Very comfortable and quiet stay.

Complimentary turn down every night and a personalized, handwritten welcome note from the first relations manager along with a complimentary drink voucher at the bar were th finishing touches on a stay that made me feel like a member of the family.

Room service was prompt and food was very tasty.

The Bloomsbury is my new favourite hotel in London. You won't be disappointed!",5,2014,02,22
115,Great hotel in great location,"I stayed here for New Years, the service and room was fab! Great cocktails in the lounge bar all the staff were friendly and the next morning we had breakfast in our room very nice! The location is superb would def go back!",5,2014,02,22
115,A place of clam in the busy city.,"My girlfriend and I stayed Sunday - Thursday. The hotel was lovely. Very pleasant and attentive staff. Extremely clean.
Superb breakfast - lots of options. 
The superior room was great the bed  was very comfortable. 
Good location for the underground.
Would highly recommend.
 ",5,2014,02,21
115,Lovely,"Beautiful building from the outside, took us a while to find only because a taxi driver took us too the wrong Bloomsbury hotel... As soon as we arrived we were greeted by the doorman & directed to the reception.  We were given our key cards & went straight upstairs. The decor is beautiful with bowls of floating candles & a gorgeous aroma filled the lobby. Our room & bathroom were rather small but had lovely decor & were nice & cosy. The bed was comfy & soft & was situated opposite a mirrored wall which made the room feel a little bigger. Not much of a view as it was a small window, looking across the street to another building. The room had a well stocked fridge & even better, a Nescafe Dolce Gusto coffee machine with a box filled with different flavoured coffee pods which was a god send in the morning. The room had a wardrobe complete with hairdryer, safe, ironing board etc. We had breakfast the next morning which consisted of a traditional english & a continental. Lovely stay, next time we hope to visit the restaurant!",3,2014,02,20
115,Excellent hotel - consistent across the board,"I stay in London on business almost every week and the Bloomsbury has now become my hotel of choice. The decor is lovely - the lobby area looks like a luncg/tea room in a country house - the service is friendly and efficient, and the rooms are well appointed (although the standard rooms can be a little small).

The location is between the British Museum and Tottenham Court Road. For those who don't know London, this is ashort walk to the restaurants and night spots of soho and the shopping of Oxford Street.

My girlfriend tells me the breakfast is very good (I have not eaten there) and the bar is cosy and relaxed. I have yet to use any fitness facilities.

This is not a cheap hotel, so probably best for business or the personally wealthy, but if you are can afford it then it is well worth the money.",4,2014,02,20
115,Amazing hotel,We stayed for one night at the hotel and from the moment we arrived we were treated exceptionally well. The staff was so kind and welcoming. Our room was divine and we had everything we needed. It is situated in the perfect location. We will definitely go back!,5,2014,02,17
115,Excellent overnight stay,"This is the second overnight stay for a theatre evening and I cannot fault the hotel in any way.
I am not easily pleased so to find no faults is indeed a rarity in my experience with hotels.
The hotel location is great for shopping the theatre district and close to three main line stations..
Staff friendly and attentive without being pushy. The hotel is stylish but not pretentious.
I have stayed in the Cork hotel from the same group and found the same level of excellence.
Would not consider any other hotel on future trips to London.
CJI Northampton",5,2014,02,17
115,Would definitely stay again!,"Lovely hotel in a great location. Staff were great to. Hotel done everything to make our stay fantastic, as it was our anniversary we really appreciated that. Would recommend this hotel to friends and family in the future and would stay again when we are next in London.",5,2014,02,17
115,Great stay,"Great service, we were allowed to check in early and out late for no extra charge. We were also given a bottle of water for our return journey. Very clean everywhere and our room was well fitted and spacious, except for small bathroom which is why I have not given it 5/5.
Breakfast gets 5/5
Will definitely return",4,2014,02,16
115,Fabulous hotel!,"We had a great weekend in London and the hotel was a big part of that! Friendly and helpful staff, clean and modern rooms with all the amenities you could want, great service, high quality food and drinks. It also has a great location, situated in a quiet road but still close enough to walk to many famous locations. We will be back!",5,2014,02,13
115,Great Hotel !!,"The Bloomsbury hotel has a very good location in London. Quiet area but still close to Soho and Covent garden. Shopping, pubs and clubs nearby. Friendly staff, fantastic facilities and really nice rooms with very comfy beds. Recommended.",5,2014,02,12
115,Classic Bloomsbury,"The Bloomsbury combines traditional charm with a contemporary twist. The staff are exceptionally polite, service is discrete and efficient. The rooms whilst not large are very comfortable with high quality fixtures and fittings. There's free wi-fi and nice touches like welcoming chocolate or pastries. A great hotel in a great location.",5,2014,02,12
115,Great hotel with good profesional staff,"I really enjoy my stay in that beautiful hotel in the center of London near Oxford Street to do shopping and near the British Museum by foot... Food was good. Very nice people, a very good staff. Room very quiet and confortable. very good bed.",5,2014,02,12
115,Beautiful classic hotel,"Comfortable beds, helpful staff, clean and tidy. They were happy to keep our cases for the day after we checked out so we could enjoy London for the day before catching the train home. Fabulous location, tube station just around the corner. Excellent and recommended to all, would definitely stay again!",5,2014,02,11
115,Excellent service great hotel,Stay in December staff where helpful from the first phone conversation to checking in and out. Hotel in good location couldn't fault anything.  Well done Bloomsbury sure we will be back again. Breakfast was good beds comfortable. ,5,2014,02,11
115,Elegance in Bloomsbury,"A travel agent recommended the Bloomsbury as her favorite boutique hotel in London, and I can certainly see why.  Elegant, accommodating of all our needs, well-situated..this hotel has it all. My husband and I had previously stayed in another hotel in the Doyle group (the Marylebone) which provided excellent service, but which was not as well-located and simply not as, well, pretty! The concierge was helpful at all times, as were all the staff members. We enjoyed the breakfast as it enabled us to see the sights all day before becoming hungry enough to seek out a late afternoon pub meal. Don't miss the Bloomsbury Hotel.",5,2014,02,10
115,This is Where I Would Choose to Stay in London!,"The Bloomsbury is an outstanding hotel.  Great location, quiet, comfortable, modern but in a building with real charm and character.

London has many great places to stay, but the one thing that made this hotel so enjoyable, was the staff.  Everyone was so genuinely welcoming and kind that it made such a real difference.

Sleep comfort was outstanding as was breakfast with a good buffet selection, with hot food prepared to order.  

Close to all the important parts of town and just 60 seconds from The Underground, this is where I would choose to stay in London every time.",5,2014,02,10
115,Perfect,"Just returned from a short visit to the Bloomsbury, had a perfect weekend staff are amazing from restaurant to Brian at the door. Very centrally located great for museums and shopping, would definitely recommend. ",5,2014,02,10
115,"Superb Staff, Superior Hotel","This little gem is not to be missed. The stuff is friendly and efficient. Brian and Abdul in concierge are Amazing. Louise at the front desk made sure I was well cared after. 

The property is superbly located, walking distance to the theater district, the Strand, Soho, the big museums etc. the Central line is a block away. The largest shopping street in Europe is also a block away. There are tons of great restaurants everywhere. FREE WIFI EVERYWHERE (are you listening Marriott ?). And it is fast even by US standards. The is especially great for the business guest. 

Now the down sides, less down perhaps, than a gentle decline. The rooms are small and the elevators slow and cramped. I would recommend a lower floor and use the steps. 

Some of the rooms have two twin beds. They bar is closed during he day but they staff will bring drinks to you in the lobby. 

That's about all I can think of. 

Bruce's travel top of the day is about the concierge service in Europe. It is much more of a profession here. Look for the crossed keys on the label of the concierge. This means they have gone through a rigorous training ",5,2014,02,07
115,Amazing!,"Stayed here on three occasions now and would not want to stay anywhere else.
Location spot on!
Very comfortable bedrooms. Not such a lover of the food but breakfast is really nice.
Staff are very helpful and knowledgable.",5,2014,02,06
115,Great service in a good location,My wife and I stayed in the Bloomsbury for the first time from Thursday 30th January to Wednesday 5th February and had a great time. Staff were very polite and attentive when required. We stayed in Room 216 which is opposite the lifts which initially was a concern but there was no noise at all. The room was well equipped and the bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was excellent with a bath and separate shower.  We had breakfast each day which was very good with an extensive hot food menu and buffet available. We had a few visits to the bar for a post dinner drink and I can recommend the excellently spiced Bloody Mary. We look forward to staying here again.,4,2014,02,06
115,January at the Bloomsbury...,"Spent two nights at the Bloomsbury in January at a conference.
Beautiful hotel, rooms are very well appointed, excellent location, staff are very attentive and friendly.

Would highly recommend the hotel.",5,2014,02,06
115,Excellent hotel in a perfect location,"We stayed in a suite in this hotel a few weeks ago for one night.  The suite was spacious and comfortable with two huge armchairs to relax in.  This is a great location with most west end theatres, restaurants, and of course Oxford Street on the doorstep - all within walking distance.  The staff were attentive, polite, extremely helpful and very professional. The basement bar is lovely environment to relax at the end of an evening and enjoy a nightcap or two. We would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,02,05
115,Denise J - Amazing Hotel,This was our third time at the Bloomsbury Hotel.  As always the staff are unbelievably polite and helpful - everyone of them.  The food is wonderful - had a pre-theatre meal and breakfast every day.  The rooms are spotless as is all of the hotel.  Someone was there all the time to order taxis for us and to carry our bags. They make you feel very special at this hotel. Thank you to all the staff for making our stay once again memorable.  I would recommend this hotel to everyone. We will be making our fourth visit later in the year - can't wait.,5,2014,02,04
115,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury on Friday and Saturday night and we thouroughly enjoyed our stay.  A very smooth check-in, room was ready and waiting for us and the concierge was so helpful.  We stayed in room 206 and although we did not have a view, it was very quiet and I had a very very good nights sleep.  The room was spotless and well equipped.  Bathroom was spotless.  We were so close to the west end and we were able to walk to both of the shows we had booked.  Also breakfast was such a relaxed affair, served up to 11.00am which enabled us to have a long lie in on Sunday morning. I would definately stay here again.  No complaints whatsoever. 5/5",5,2014,02,04
115,Fantastic hotel and location,"This is my second visit to the Bloomsbury and I highly recommend it.

Reception area has a calm vibe compared with most other hotels that are all hustle and bustle. Check in was swift with an extremley pleasant and professional host. We stayed in a deluxe room which was very spacious by London standards. The room is well equipped also has good temp controls and a spacious bathroom with seperate shower.
The room was cleaned to a good standard each day. 

The location is perfect a 1min walk to Tottenham court road station. Local shop and restraunts right out side with a supermarket and pharmacy at the end of street. Within Walking distance to Oxford street, Leicester square and Covent garden. 

This is a well kept hotel that has charm and character. Rooms are well maintained.
There are often good rates to be found which is an added bonus.

I have stayed in several hotels in London but Bloomsbury remains top of my list. I will be returning to stay on my next visit to London. 

",5,2014,02,03
115,A Great Location,"We spent a superb time at the hotel.  We had a lovely welcome by the staff; nothing was too much trouble.  Our room was very comfortable and well-equipped and quiet.  How civilized it is, too, to be able to go down, at the latest by 11.00 a.m., for breakfast and still find a wide variety of food to eat.  We are not ""morning"" people so this was a treat not to have to rush and we could take our time to wake up!  The Bloomsbury Hotel is approximately 20-25 minutes walk from the theatres in the West End which was ideal for us as we had come up so see two plays.  We walked to Camden Market as well.  Another bonus.  It is possible to eat an evening meal at the hotel, but there are plenty of nearby restaurants if you wish to eat out.  Nonetheless, the food is very reasonable in price; they do a cracking hot chocolate.  The hotel is very near the Dickens Museum.  Thank you to all the staff who made our stay very enjoyable and relaxing.  We shall stay there again.",5,2014,02,03
115,A Fine Hotel in Central London,"This is a fine hotel with a relaxed atmosphere that you feel as soon as you walk in the front doors, thanks to the soft lighting and scented candles burning in the lobby that feels more like the sitting room of a large home. The location is convenient for the West End, shopping on Oxford Street, Soho, Covent Garden and the British Museum. The Tottenham Court Tube station is just 5 minutes away and the hotel is easily reached by taxi from Paddington Train Station if you are arriving in the UK via Heathrow.

Rooms are quiet and well-appointed with comfortable beds, good quality linens and pillows. The hotel has a small but well-equipped fitness centre, although there is no pool. The business centre is located at one end of the lobby with terminals, printer and scanner. Wifi is available throughout the hotel.

The staff members are very friendly and helpful. All requests are met with a smile and fulfilled as soon as possible. 

Breakfast is served in the lower ground floor restaurant that also serves as the dinner time restaurant. Breakfast is either from a buffet or from the menu and is well-prepared. The dinner time experience did not match up with expectations created by the rest of the experience at the hotel. The food was not so well-prepared and the prices too high for the quality delivered. You will have a better experience at nearby restaurants for less money.

For a central London hotel in this location with the level of service and quality of rooms the Bloomsbury is a very good value proposition well-worth your consideration.",5,2014,02,02
115,Great place,"Lovely place for a Saturday in London. Room was great and staff very friendly. Great breakfast and room had plenty of space, nespresso was great, bathroom was very nice with a great shower. Quick to check in and out and again very friendly staff",4,2014,02,02
115,Great feel to this hotel,Very pleasant stay - the Bloomsbury has a great relaxing feel to it. Cosy comfortable room and not at all noisy. Dinner in the restaurant was excellent - would especially recommend the burger! Our only quibble was the breakfast. The buffet style breakfast was fairly limiting and wasn't replenished - we had to ask.  Overall though we'd definitely return.,4,2014,02,01
115,Great value for money,"Great hotel, in a central location for a reasonable room rate for London. What more could you ask for. Our room was clean and cozy. Didn't have a great nights sleep due to the fire alarm going off three times but that aside would definitely stay again.",4,2014,01,31
115,First class hotel,We stayed in this hotel for a couple of days for a business conference on 28th and 29th January 2014. I found the service excellent and the staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly. In particular there was a concierge named Kasif who was so helpful. He gave us great directions for anywhere we were going. He always had a smile on his face and remembered my name every time I came into the hotel. Staff like Kasif are so important to a hotel as they are the first people you meet when you enter a hotel and they give you the first impression of a hotel. The rooms were very comfortable and very quiet. The reception were also very helpful and friendly. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anybody visiting London for business or pleasure. It is also very central. Only a walk away from Oxford St and Covent garden. Well done!,5,2014,01,31
115,"Luxurious, friendly and convenient","I loved staying here and couldn't fault The Bloomsbury Hotel in anyway. The hotel is beautiful, and luxurious, and the all staff were so helpful and friendly. I felt at home here and it was very convenient to so many of the famous London sights. The Concierge was particularily helpful and gave me daily advice on how to get about and make the most of my stay in London. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone if you don't mind spending a few quid.",5,2014,01,31
115,"High quality, great location, fantastic staff","The Bloomsbury is in a great location, right off Oxford Street/ Tottenham Court Road and very convenient to TCR tube station. The foyer is a bit unconventional but is really welcoming. I had a room on the eighth floor and was hardly able to hear any noise from the busy London streets. The breakfast is a bit pricey at £21 but a good quality Irish breakfast. One minor gripe is that in many ways the hotel feels like a piece of Ireland in London with the breakfasts, newspapers etc but they really should stock i
irish breakfast tea to get it right. But that is a very minor gripe.",5,2014,01,30
115,Fantastic hotel!,"Great weekend in London with my husband. We stayed at The Bloomsbury Hotel for 2 nights in January 2014 and it was fantastic. 
The location is perfect. Near the Tottenham Court Road Metro Station (a few minutes walk). Short walk to Convent Garden, Soho, Oxford Street.... 
The hotel staff were very friendly and welcoming. We arrived at 10 a.m., the room was ready and it was possible the early check-in.
The street is very quiet and the bed was perfect, extremely comfortable. Slept like a baby.
The room was spacious enough and well decorated. 
The breakfast was very good, with good buffet selection.
The hotel offers free WIFI and an iPod/iPhone docking station in the room.
Good service and high standards. The outstanding service of all staff needs to be pointed out. The best of all was the service we received from Estelita.
We already recommend this hotel and we will stay again.",5,2014,01,28
115,Loved it!,"I stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel on Saturday the 25th January. On check in the staff were very welcoming. The room was immaculate and well stocked with above average quality bathroom products. I can honestly say I have NEVER slept in a bed as comfortable as the one in room 426! I seriously could have stayed in bed all day!

We had drinks in the basement bar which again were lovely - try the Espresso Martini it's delicious! Again the service was faultless.

We were booked to see a gig at Soho Theatre so needed to get there for a certain time. The doorman went out of his way to walk to the main street in order to hail a cab - what a star (it was lashing down at this point). I hope his boss reads this as he really did go - quite literally 'the extra mile!!' 

Highly recommend this hotel and will definitely return.",5,2014,01,28
115,Fantastic hotel in a perfect location,"Stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel for 2 nights in late December 2013 (first chance I've got to write the review).  Absolutely wonderful experience.  First of all the location was perfect, just a few minutes walking distance to the tube station or a short walk to main attractions like Oxford Street, Leicester Square, Convent Garden etc. The hotel staff where very friendly and welcoming, always saying hello each time we walked past and holding the main entrance door open for us each time we left the hotel.  The hotel itself was beautiful.  Our hotel room was a reasonable size and very clean, the beds very comfortable, fresh bedding both nights and they left us a couple of chocolates next to the bed.  The hotel offers free WIFI and an iPod/iPhone docking station in the room was also a bonus.  Would recommend this hotel.",5,2014,01,27
115,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed here for the weekend, the staff are very friendly, the location is fantastic, rooms are clean and the turn down service is great. Breakfast was fab, great buffet selection plus eggs Benedict were amazing!! We turned up 5 minutes before they were closing Sunday and they still served us!! also, the hotel smells amazing, lots of scented candles scattered around!  Brilliant stay! Would highly recommend!!",5,2014,01,27
115,Wonderful hotel as part of threatre stayover for my daughters 21st,"Great weekend in London with our daughters and her friends. Very friendly staff, rooms are small but very clean. Beds were extremely comfortable, I enjoyed one of best nights sleep...in a long time! Brilliant location for getting around this fabulous city.",4,2014,01,25
115,Excellent City Centre Hotel,"If you want good service and high standards you need look no further, this hotel ticks all the boxes. Beautifully appointed rooms and free wifi throughout the hotel is a bonus. The staff are very friendly and keen to please. Lovely bar and good food. The reception/lobby area has large comfy seating and throughout the hotel scented candles burn so a beautiful aroma is everywhere. Great location, walking distance to Leicester Square, Covert Garden and theatre land. Oxford Street shopping is on the door step too as well as the British Museum. We had a perfect weekend break here.",5,2014,01,20
115,A Really Nice Hotel,"We stayed here for my birthday, the hotel was lovely. The staff were really nice, and the room although small was very nice and clean. The location was ideal, right down the road from Tottenham court tube station and the Hakasan Restuarant. We had cocktails in the bar before we went out for the evening and the bar was cool, would recommend to stay here.",5,2014,01,20
115,"Great location, perfect service","Stayed for one night in a suite. From arrival to departure, all staff were exceptionally polite and helpful. All areas were spotlessly clean and of very high standards. Suite was very spacious and well decorated. Landseer Bar was a lovely way to end an evening out, relaxed and stress free.
Will definitely visit here again, ideal spot for West End and sightseeing.  Worth paying that little bit more for a quality hotel",5,2014,01,20
115,Great central location and comfortable hotel,"This hotel has a great location just of Tottenham Court Road, so close to Oxford Street and theatres and you can easily connect to other parts of the city via the Underground.
A very comfortable hotel with almost a ""boutique"" feel about it. Rooms are on the small side but certainly large enough for a short stay and they are very well furnished and maintained offering some nice details such as complimentary Nespresso. Reception staff give a pleasant welcome and the restaurant offers a good menu. Overall a great hotel for a business or short leisure stay and would consider staying here again.",4,2014,01,17
115,Landseer Bar in Bloomsbury Hotel. Go there!,"The Bloomsbury Hotel seriously expands your view on price/performance ratio against similar hotels in this part of London. Make sure you stop by the Landseer Bar. Perfect mix of dining and bar, professional and personal atmosphere, well selected wine menue. The outstanding service staff needs to be pointed out. You have a sophisticated question about Wine? Ask for Jeff.",5,2014,01,14
115,Highly recommended,"What a wonderful hotel, the location is excellent and the hotel itself is warm and welcoming. We had a super room, spacious, furnished to a high standard, clean and comfortable. From arrival to departure the whole experience was brilliant. A special mention must go to Jeffry, what an asset to the hotel.  Working in the reception bar, nothing is to much trouble, he even treated me to a wonderful honey and lemon drink for my sore throat ! Thanks Jeffry for making our stay extra special. It was our second visit, and from now on every time we go to London The Bloomsbury will be our first choice.",4,2014,01,14
115,Magnificent Christmas Experience,"My Fiance and I were looking for somewhere special to spend our Christmas 2013. We certainly found it. 
From the moment we arrived the staff excelled at making us feel welcome. Joelle at reception was extremely helpful. The room was lovely, and very opulent bathroom. One criticism of the room would be that there was only one small wardrobe as the other half of it was occupied with a nesspresso machine. 
The bar/restaurant are visually impressive as well as serving delicious food with helpful happy staff. Alina who worked in the bar until the early hours was amazingly accommodating. Our glasses were never empty and we were always welcomed with a smile. 

The location of The Bloomsbury was perfect. A stone throw from Soho,Oxford St a short walk to china town and convent garden. There is a tube station approx. 2 minute walk from the hotel too should you need to go further a field. Parking is directly opposite the hotel. 

I must say that every member of staff we came in to contact with impressed us. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff for making our stay a perfect Christmas getaway. Zain and Bruno on reception at night and the concierge who Im afraid I didn't get his name, Joelle and Alina. We both wish you a very happy new year and are looking forward to returning to The Bloomsbury very soon . 
Rhianon and Royce Benson .",5,2014,01,13
115,Amazing,"Came for a we with my boyfriend. The room was lovely, the hotel is amazing, calm and well situated, the staff really kind and nice. Cant say anything negative. Didnt try the breakfast, because we woke up late and prefered to take our time in the morning to relax. There was everything to have a tea anyway in the bedroom. I'll go back whenever I need.... :-)",5,2014,01,13
115,31-12-2013,"I would highly recommend this hotel. Slept like a baby, bed was very comfortable. Wish I had another night there. Staffs welcoming was brilliant. Room was clean, bathroom was extra clean. Very happy, will stay again.",5,2014,01,10
115,Needs to buck its ideas up a bit,"To start with the positives, this is a beautiful building in a fantastic location. The room was a decent size and quiet, if rather dark. Wardrobe space was very limited, and only one drawer. A huge amount of space was take up by a noisy minibar fridge, which should be scrapped. But there were loads of little niggles - lamps that didn't work, wardrobe lights that didn't switch off when you closed the door, shower gel was not routinely stocked up - I had to ring down to get some more sent up. Slthough we specifically asked for an early check-in, the room was not ready when we arrived; and we had also asked for the double bed to be split into two singles, but it too two attempts to get this right. The staff were generally friendly, but refused to serve me a drink in the beautiful foyer, insisting instead that I go down to the dingy basement bar. Why? I was meeting a friend and hoped to impress her with the foyer grandeur. Instead, we agreed that the bar could have been anywhere. So, I'm afraid I probably won't be back soon. It's just not customer-focused enough, and there is a lack of attention to detail. By the way, don't take the hotel breakfast, but walk a block north to Gail's Kitchen - best patisserie and coffee around, for half the price.",3,2014,01,08
115,Great location,We have stayed at this hotel before its in a great location. and the staff have always been very helpful. We will go back again later this year -   the British Museum is just across the road and its FREE,4,2014,01,07
115,Fantastic location,"After looking at so many London hotels that would suit our needs, we decided on the Bloomsbury. This hotel is in a great location, Tottenham court road tube station is just round the corner and its about 2 minutes walk to oxford street. Lots of restaurants/ fast food also within short walking distance.

Staff around the hotel were pleasant and polite, and check in/ out was hassle free. Our room was ready when we arrived at 10am which was great as we had an early start. Also the night before we checked out, we asked the reception staff if it was possible to have a late checkout. We were able to stay in our room until 1pm for free but anything after that would be half a night rate.

The hotel room itself was nice however we did pay a little extra for a superior room, but I can't imagine that this was any different from a standard room. Room was cleaned thoroughly each day and plenty of towels etc. The coffee/ tea making facilities were fantastic, the nespresso machine was a lovely extra. My husband was delighted with the extra tv channels that you don't usually get such as Sky sports 1,2&3. 

Breakfast was included in our stay, but we only managed to get up one out of the 3 mornings during our stay. Nothing was too much bother for the staff and we left feeling full.",4,2014,01,03
115,Wonderful Service from Estelita,"My wife and I had a wonderful lunch at the Landseer just before Christmas. The atmosphere was mafgical and the food excellent but besrt of all was the service we received from Estelita. 

The restaurant was busy with a number of corporate parties but she gave us her full attention and the service was exemplary.

The restaurant is very convenient to the British Museum and provides a wonderful interlude during a full day of museum exhibitions.

We shall certainly go again.

115,Truly excellent hotel,"When you book and 5 star hotel in London the Bloomsbury offers the experience you expect. We had a superior room at the front of the property. Big windows that let in lots of light and the room was immaculate. 

The service from the staff was great, they couldn't do enough to help. Would definitely stay again as the location is perfect. A short walk to Covent Garden or Soho but in a quiet location aay from traffic and street noise.

Don't hesitate to book!",5,2014,01,02
115,"Great Location, fantastic staff!","We stayed here for 2 nights between Christmas and New Year.  The hotel is in a great location, just around the corner from Tottenham Court Road tube station, and in walking distance to both Covent Garden & Oxford Street. The Dominion Theatre is also 2 mins walk - ideal for those wanting to see 'We will rock you'.
The staff could not be more helpful - would definitely stay here again!",5,2013,12,31
115,"Great location, pretty hotel, poor service","I booked the Bloomsbury after reading great reviews on tripadvisor and was very surprised and disappointed about the poor service we recieved during our stay. I'm not usually a complainer but this time I'll take the time to write a review. We arrived early and decided to go by the hotel to leave our luggage. No one helped us with the luggage and no one came to see if we needed any assistance. I went to the reception to check-in but they couldn't find my reservation. They asked us to sit down so they could make some calls. After 35 min we were offered some tea and then we waited another 15 min before the issue was resolved. When we got to the room it was freezing and I realized that there was no extra bed which we had asked for in the reservation. I called the reception and asked about the bed and the first response was that it's going to be additional charges. Not the most service minded reply. An extra bed was arranged. The bathroom was clean but shampoo bottles had not been refilled and was half empty. At 20:30 they called from reception telling me that they was to charge my credit card for the room. Ok why call about that when they knew that I had small children that perhaps had gone to bed? The next afternoon they called again about the room charges, at this point I was rather annoyed they asked if they could offer any compensation perhaps something sweet for the kids. I accepted, the compensation was 5 microwaved fruit pies. If that is considered compensation don't bother.
One night we went to the bar to have something small to eat, we waited 45 min and then we got the wrong order. Our waiter was very sweet and offered us free drinks as compensation.
At check-out the bill was wrong and the pre-paid reservation fee had not been deducted.
All these things can happen I just feel that we experienced far too many hick-ups and that the approach from the staff was not as forthcoming and professional as I'd expected. I'm sure that this probably was just bad luck given that so many on tripadvisor are positive about the hotel. But we will not come back to this hotel and can not recommend it to anyone.

115,A favourite,"I stay at the Bloomsbury quite regularly for work and it is always a pleasure. The hotel is immaculately decorated and in a great location for my work and the west end.
The room I take is a superior double which provides an excellent bed and bathroom at a good price, with breakfast included.
And they will always have a place in my heart as last time I stayed I left my passport and other vital documents in the safe when I checked out. But upon retuning a little later that day the lovely staff recovered them for me without complaint, which was quite a relief - next time I will leave the minibar alone!
Will be back next year of course.",5,2013,12,23
115,A great location and well decorated,"A lovely evening after a night out. Booked with hotel tonight and we were well received. Excellent service and we had a great night's sleep. As I said before, it is a great location and more than enough space for a few nights. We stayed in room 116. I would recommend.",4,2013,12,20
115,Great hotel in a great location,"Spent a lovely 2 night pre christmas break here last week. The hotel was lovely and christmasy on arrival which made it even more welcoming. The room we had was lovely on the sixth floor, it had a lovely big bathroom with separate shower and bath, I especially love the bath products used here. The restaurant was very handy as it serves late and just what we needed after a late flight arrival. There is a great selection at breakfast from the buffet and hot menu. 
The location of this hotel is fab as its just at bottom of Oxford Street and also beside the tube station at Tottenham Court Rd which has the central line so we found the location so handy for getting the christmas shopping done! Would definitely return",5,2013,12,19
115,Excellent,"First stay at this hotel.  I found the staff to be very welcoming and quite knowledgeable.  The room we had was well furnished and clean.  The hotel generally looked very well maintained, all decoration was good.  Very clean throughout.  I would stay here again.  The position of the hotel was really an advantage for those who shop!  All in all a very good experience.",5,2013,12,19
115,Stylish and personal,"Good quality. Modern feel in the rooms within an authentic and stylish environment (hallways, breakfast room, facade etc).

Nice personnel. Good quality breakfast (but very hot in the breakfast room).

Good location!",4,2013,12,18
115,"Excellent Hotel, awful experience.","I have stayed here a few times and it cannot be disputed - it is a lovely hotel, finished well with stylish rooms and priced well in line with location and quality.

Rooms are not massive but certainly roomy enough. Bed is comfortable and pillows are feathered and plump. Nespresso machine in upgraded rooms and the coffee tray is well stocked with biscuits and teas, coffees and hot chocolates.

Bathrooms excellent too, toiletries plentiful and shower hot and water pressure good.

I arrived late last night after a long day and evening at work. I therefore wanted to enjoy a good nights rest and bit of a lie in this morning. That wasn't to be thanks to the horrific and extremely pushy house keeping staff on floor 5. Utterly disgraceful is the only way I can describe the experience. I stayed in room 522.

I placed the little red 'do not disturb' at my door at 8.11am this morning a housekeeper knocked loudly, came into the room and woke me up. She apologised and left. She proceeded to knock loudly and clean vacated rooms around me, rendering me unable to get back to sleep. At 9.21am she was back knocking on my door and I told her promptly to go away. At 10.42am the door knocked again and by this stage I was furious, packed my bags and left.

It was obvious they wanted me out of my room and I cant explain why. It was both harassing and extremely annoying. I will unfortunately not be staying at this hotel again, which is a shame as I have used it before as it is close to my place of work.

Minibar prices are high compared to other London Hotels. Even more expensive than the Hilton with still water costing £3.25 a bottle. Many 4 star plus hotels will provide a bottle for free in the room.

I find it hard to rate my stay beyond a 2 star rating as I left angry, tired and everything I shouldn't have from an establishment like this. Poor.",2,2013,12,18
115,Loving the Bloomsbury,The Bloomsbury looked invitingly lit up as we arrived on a Dec eve. We were offered a refreshing cucumber water as we checked in. We had a superior double room. Highly finished room. Great bathroom. Really good bar serving champagne cocktails and helpful staff. All very central. And there was no tray charge for breakfast in bed!,5,2013,12,16
115,Lovely Hotel - Would recommend,"We stayed at Bloomsbury in middle of December for one night on a Saturday.
Arrival: I had contacted the hotel prior to ask if possible an earlier check in would be appreciated and they were able to accommodate this request. Simple check in process and friendly staff.
Rooms: (423) was lovely and looked out onto the street, it had big bed, bath & shower, coffee machine, large flat screen TV etc. and was very comfortable and clean.
Nice little touches such as couple chocolates left in our room in the evening.
Although there was some faint traffic noise it was December so we didn't need the windows open and found no problems with noise.
Food & Drink: We didn't eat at the hotel however we did have a drink in the bar, were well looked after and Joel knew how to make good cocktails.
Location: 5 minutes walk to Soho/Covent Garden, 30-40 minutes walk along Oxford Street to Marble Arch and 7 minutes on the tube to Camden, it was well located for central London.

Overall it was a lovely stay at the hotel (as a birthday treat) and would happily stay again.",5,2013,12,16
115,"Great location, excellent stuff","The standard room was not as spacious as it could be, still I enjoyed staying in the hotel. Some minor issues occurred, but the stuff settled everything promptly. All the personnel were friendly and helpful, especially the hostess at the restaurant, Estelita. I do hope to visit London shortly and   stay at the very same hotel again.",5,2013,12,15
115,Great staff,An excellent hotel and a wonderful staff. Paolo was especially helpful in securing some hard-to-get tickets for us and making sure that all went smoothly at the box office. He also gave us great recommendations for restaurants. We are most grateful!,5,2013,12,13
115,Excellent customer service,"Arrived and found I had booked the following night, my mistake but reception could not have reacted better. I sat in a comfortable sofa with a complimentary drink near by whilst it was sorted. I was even upgraded for my inconvenience. Fanstatic given it was my mistake!! The rooms are to a high standard and the facilities were great. Location was great for my business needs the next day and its only a short work to Oxford Street or the Theatres. Will definately return.",5,2013,12,13
115,Great central location with great service,"Stayed 1 night recently for a charity ball. We've stayed several times previously and it never fails to disappoint. From the moment we arrived to when we left we received personal service. The hotel has a particularly welcoming atmosphere, creating the perfect ambience, with friendly staff, well designed rooms with comfortable beds.",5,2013,12,12
115,Lovely hotel,"Spent last weekend at The Bloomsbury and had an excellent stay.  Suite 312 was large, well equipped and very comfy. The roll top bath was a lovely touch. Did not eat at the hotel but had drinks in the bar. Staff extremely professional and polite.  Check in and out was swift and well organised. One slight hitch with our bill was promptly corrected and apologised for. Will definitely book to stay again in the new year for our next London trip as the location of The Bloomsbury is excellent. ",5,2013,12,12
115,A lovely traditional hotel with fantastic service,"Stayed 1 night last weekend as a special pre-xmas treat and was not disappointed. It's a beautiful, cosy, stylish, traditional hotel with fantastic service. The rooms have been modernised and decorated to a high standard. The location was perfect, within walking distance of Oxford street and Soho. I was impressed with the small touches that made a difference such as the cold hand towels at check -in and the refreshing jugs of cucumber water in the reception area.",5,2013,12,11
115,An excellent experience,"From the moment we arrived at the Bloomsbury Hotel we were pampered.The staff were friendly and welcoming, couldn't ask for better. One member of staff, Brian, was an absolute star. We were having a problem sourcing a gift for our granddaughter , Brian got it for us on his day off - what service. We were upgraded in our room as it was a belated wedding anniversary trip to London,the hotel gave us a card plus a bottle of champayne. All in all a very enjoyable stay. would highly recommend the hotel.",5,2013,12,11
115,Excellent stay due to hotel staff,"Visiting London for a Carol Service, 3rd stay at the hotel. Due to a problem during our last stay we were upgraded to Superior Room with breakfast. Checked in early and left luggage as attending Church Service and came back at 1500hrs to be given our room. On entering room on the 3rd floor there was a ""booming"" /disco noise underneath and I rang Reception asking if we were under the bar? They dealt with the problem as last stay was disrupted due to noise. The Guest Manager upgraded us to a Suite on the 7th floor and also gave us Complimentary dinner.
We only had time for a quick meal in the restaurant due to attenting the Military Tattoo in the evening. Staff at the Bloomsbury Hotel make your stay, they go out of their way to be courteous and make each individual feel welcome at the hotel.
Will stay again.
Thank you",5,2013,12,09
115,Style comfort experience rest all of this in a great location,My job force me to travel all over the world so I take the hotel experience very personal and for me The Bloomsbury hotel was a great surprise because I find such a beautiful hotel with rooms carefully desing to add space style and comfort in a tight London. Really  loved it,5,2013,12,09
115,As good as their word,"After a slightly disappointing experience last year the hotel contacted me and offered a free upgrade and breakfast if we returned.  We did go back exactly 12 months later and they honoured that commitment throughout our 3 night stay.  Given that breakfast is over £20 each, my wife and I recognised that was a fairly substantial offer on their part and it was therefore appreciated.  This is a good hotel and we like it and although there is the odd thing that niggles we will likely be back again next year.",4,2013,12,08
115,Amazing Stay at the Bloomsbury,"Ok, so this review is backdated quite a bit, though hopefully it'll still be of use.

My husband & I stayed at the Bloomsbury in April 2012 for 3 nights. We decided to book the bloomsbury at the time due to its trip advisor ranking - it came within the top 10 in London at that time, though as our trip drew nearer there were quite a number of not so good reviews. It was a special break for us, and we didn't want to risk being let down, we debated cancelling and changing hotel to one of our original contenders, though we opted to contacted the hotel directly, the GM at the time was Becky, who replied offering us a good deal of reassurance about our forthcoming trip.

We had the most amazing stay, on arriving our room was not ready, though the receptionist advised we had been upgraded to the middle room category which was a lovely added bonus, we were advised to come back at 2pm. We arrived back and our room was still not ready, and we were asked to take a seat for a few minutes, the assistance manager then came over to speak to us and he had upgraded us to a suite for the entire stay!!! 

We were shown to our huge room, with an entrance seating area, a huge bed, a seperate seating area with 2 chaise's,  a massive flatscreen tv, and to top it off a massive bathroom, with seperate room for WC, seperate area for shower, 2 wash hand basins and a beautiful roll top bath - with TV mounted in the wall!!!! And to top it all off - a bottle of Moet was delivered to our room - i thought the waitress had brought it to the wrong room at first, then she advised it was courtesy of the manager!!!

We had the most amazing 3 nights at this hotel, it was truly beautiful.... the location wasn't great, you were within walking distance of most things, and the underground was just along the road, though the area wasn't very good to walk about in at  night - we always opted for a cab!

We ate at Gordon Ramsays Petrus & Goodmans Steak house in Maddox st, both of which were sublime.... we also had the elite package on the thames river cruise in the Symphony all glass boat which was just phenomenal! the food wasn't great for £250.00 for 2 people, though it was all about the experience!

Becky, if you're still at the hotel, thank you so much for a wonderful stay!!!",5,2013,12,08
115,Lovely staff,"Hi, I stayed on a Thursday for 3 nights and was amazed how lovely the staff are!! Everyone is friendly and always smiles, the hotel is warm and makes you feel at home! The rooms are a decent size and the location is just amazing.... Actually prefer it to oxford street. I shall be back! You guys can charge more for what you offer believe me! Thank you for everything we will be your new regulars xxx",5,2013,12,05
115,"Great Hotel, Great Location","Hotel is centrally located near SoHo and the British Museum. Lobby was nice but room was spectacular: beautiful furnishings, large room, convenient power sources, nice sitting area, beautiful and large marble bathroom with claw footed it  and separate rainforest shower. 
Service was nice from arrival through departure, room was not ready upon arrival but after a quick visit to the British Museum (2 minutes away) we were shown to our room. 
Tea in the Library was great and inexpensive at £30 including a glass of champagne. 
Location was great for eating out and drinking in SoHo.",4,2013,12,04
115,2 night stay bloomsbury great russel street,"We stayed in a superior room which was not huge but still very nice, towels changed daily.

115,Short Stay for 50th Party,"A really nice hotel in an amazingly convenient location 

All the staff were friendly & very helpful

The complimentry bottle of water on departure is a nice touch too",4,2013,12,02
115,Enjoyable,"My partner and I got here on 29th of November and stayed for 2 nights. The location is amazing. We were upgraded and received pressco as it was my birthday which was lovely! The room was clean and quiet. The few niggles were that the water pressure was not so good, the drinks were very expensive, and upon check in we were not told where anything was or times of breakfast etc. was just given our key. Also at lunch time we wanted to sit in the bar for drinks and nibbles but it did not open until 4pm? So sat in the lobby which We was not happy with so we went out. 
Oh the breakfast was lovely. 
We would return if it wasn't so expensive. Then we would feel it was great value for money. 
Hope this helps.

115,'Amazing',"We originally chose to stay at this hotel due to its location and after reading outstanding reviews on TripAdvisor we were not disappointed. The hotel is outstanding in so many ways. The staff are extremely friendly and their customer service is second to none. Nothing is too much trouble for them. Our room was very luxurious and spotlessly clean. We enjoyed every aspect of the room from daily newspapers, constant replenishment of beverages, bed sheets being turned down to weather forecast details and chocolates left each evening. The room was well insulated - quiet and peaceful stay. We spent a weekend in London to celebrate a birthday and were surprised with a complimentary bottle of wine from the hotel. Absolutely amazing stay - will 100% definitely stay here again.",5,2013,11,30
115,Wonderful,"I have stayed at this hotel twice and it really is the best I have stayed at when I've been in London, the first time I stayed there was a lady playing the harp when we were sitting downstairs but I didn't see her this time, I was on a high floor and it was lovely to look from the window and see the area when I got in at night, it was late so the street were almost empty and being high up there was no sound, very surreal and nice, the rooms are very comfortable with high bouncy beds, lovely en suite bathrooms, handy for theatre and shopping which is what this trip was, I'll definately be returning here when I'm visiting this part of London",5,2013,11,28
115,"great service, super hotel","i was visiting london for a few days and passed the hotel after visiting the british museum and  decided to call into the hotel to relax and have a coffee before going to see a show 
all the staff where very welcoming 
i was sat having coffee and flicking through my a to z of london looking for the theatre for that evening
brian murphy came to me and said hello and asked if i needed any help with directions
i explained i was looking for the lyceum theatre and he went and got a good a4  sized map for me and with a pen drew my route to the lyceum which was great as i had no idea where to go
i then decided as mr murphy was so helpfull and i was so comfortable decided to have some food before going to the theatre which mr murphy arranged for us 
i was staying at adifferent hotel however on my next visit i will stay at the bloomsbury !!!!!",5,2013,11,27
115,Fun in london,"I stayed here with my two children Tuesday 29th and Wednesday 30th October.  We had to amend our booking due to trains not traveling into London the previous day, the hotel kindly amended our booking and did not charge us for the Monday evening that we where original booked.  The staff at the hotel we extremely helpful and made the children feel very welcome.  The rooms where well furnished, clean and comfortable.  

We did not eat breakfast at the hotel as I thought that paying the £15 charge for children was excessive considering they are 8 and 4 considering I had to upgrade the room to accommodate one adult and two children.

Cost of hotel not cheap but not excessive for London.  Location great.  

Children loved the concierge Brian he had loads of time for them a credit to the hotel  

I would return to the hotel again very enjoyable visit.",4,2013,11,27
115,Lovely Hotel,"Superb hotel, very good service, excellent location.  The staff were attentive and very pleasant.  The rooms were spotless with very comfortable beds and plenty of tea and coffee.Very conveniently located for the theatres and Oxford Street, and only a 15 minute walk to Trafalgar Square.  Tottenham Court Road tube station is just around the corner but there are lots of roadworks there at the moment, and it gets a bit confusing.  Breakfast at the hotel was nice, but I only had the continental, not the cooked breakfast so I cannot comment on that.  The dining room service was very good, and didnt feel hurried at all.  The tables do seem to be very close together though, and if you get a table at the edge of the room, the comfortable chairs are very low, so the table is almost at your chin!",4,2013,11,26
115,Very impressed,"Great location for shopping,theatres,restaurants,and attractions.
Hotel has lovely rooms ,comfortable beds,and a nice feel ,my only slight criticism was that I found the bar somewhat cramped,small and chaotic, however certainly one of the better hotels I have stayed in London and will return

115,Can't wait to go back!,"We visited this lovely hotel 9/10 November , and can't wait to go back.
Lovely welcome, all staff were very good, helpful and cheerful. The aroma when you walk through the doors is relaxing without being overpowering. The whole hotel was clean and not tired like some we have stayed in, bedroom lovely , bed comfy, no noise from rest of hotel at all in room 316 or 317 .  Breakfast very nice and well worth cost  even better if inclusive as ours was, staff very attentive. 
I have been in business in the service industry, I'm not easily pleased and soon find cause to complain as I have a tendency to pay attention to detail and feel others in the service industry should do the same.",5,2013,11,25
115,Lovely hotel,"My husband & I really enjoyed our stay.  Our room was very comfortable & clean.  We loved the expresso machine in the room & the fact that decaf coffee was provided as it rarely is.
The hotel is a brilliant location, close enough to walk to Oxford street but far enough away that the noise wasn't a problem.  Our only criticism was the way we were treated at breakfast on the fisry morning of our stay, when the man in charge of the restaurant believed we only had continental breakfast included when I had paid for the English breakfast.  Instead of going away & checking this he stood & argued with my in front of other guests which was quite embarrassing & then when he finally did go & call reception to check he didn't bother coming straight back to me so I sat waiting for what felt like a very long time.  Eventually a waitress went over to him to check.  He then cam back & said they had made an error & took my order,  by this time my husband had already had the continental breakfast as he couldn't wait for food any longer which was extremely annoying as his was already paid for. Apart from this one man the rest of the staff were absolutely lovely and overly helpful.",4,2013,11,25
115,Lovely Hotel,Our 2nd time here and once again a very pleasant stay.  A hot hand towel and a welcoming drink were offered at check in. I had mentioned that it was our anniversary and we were given an upgraded room upon arrival and then 1/2 hour later there was a knock at the door and a lovely chilled bottle of prosecco along with a card arrived! All very nice touches that will ensure we would not hesitate to stay here again. The room was lovely and the hotel is perfectly situated for a night out in the West End. All the staff we came across were charming and friendly.,5,2013,11,25
115,Lovely stay. ,Just returned from a three night stay at this great hotel. The staff really make this a lovely place to stay. It is fabulously located for theatre and shopping. The room was lovely especially as we were up graded.  Very comfortable and well appointed on the sixth floor. No problem with any noise and I'm a light sleeper. Didn't eat breakfast but the pre theatre meal was lovely.  ,5,2013,11,24
115,Fantastic stay,"We stayed at the bloomsbury this month on a shopping trip! The hotel is well maintained, clean and very well organised. The check in was great, hot towel and a drink on arrival is such a nice touch. Our room was beautiful and immaculate, breakfast excellent although the coffee taste could be better. Nice buffet! Dinner is lovely, beautiful ambience and the phillipino barman was fun, we had to wait in the bar to get a table but we probably should have booked! Thanks!!!",5,2013,11,24
115,Bloom-intastic!,"Stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel two weeks in a row for business. A very warm reception by Ben on the desk, hot towel offered and lovely festive cinnamon drink too which were lovely touches. The room was tastefully decorated and bed very comfy for a great night's rest. Breakfast has a great continental selection. I enjoyed the fruit salad, as nice choice of fruit including few types of melon, pineapple and papaya, yum! Coffee/Tea, toast and fresh juice is brought to you by order which is good service.  Also dined in the hotels restaurant. I opted for two 'small plates' of squid and seafood noodles which were very tasty however they were bigger than expected so I probably could have been satisfied with one, however I'm sure those with larger appetites would have been more than happy. Really love this hotel, keep it up!",5,2013,11,23
115,Very good.,"My wife and I decided to return to the bloomsbury as we were on a shopping trip. As usual the reception staff were excellent, couldn't do enough for you. I requested low floor which we were given. The restaurant food was very good with very good service! The room was very clean and bed comfortable. Breakfast was ok but the service was not!!  We felt we were being rushed to finish our breakfast on the first morning of our stay as the manager on duty constantly was looking at his watch and looking towards our table. On the second morning we asked for toast to be better toasted and it was as if we were asking them to cut their arm off for us. Not too good considering the price we paid for our two night stay. Overall this hotel is beautiful and would return but without paying to have breakfast",4,2013,11,22
115,excellent service and very good location,"We stayed 3 nights and had a very good experience. The staff were all very friendly and helpful.  room 605 was very compact, shower only, no bath, but we had all we needed and a very generous hospitaily tray which was replenished in the evening. a comfortable bed with good linen. I would have given this hotel rating 5 but the soundproofing was inadequate as I was woken by next doors alarm clock etc!!
I would however stay again in this hotel but upgrade to another room.we did not sample the breakfast.",4,2013,11,21
115,Mr & Mrs Jeffries,"Stayed for one night as we going to theatre,lovely hotel, great location and very clean and tidy. We asked if we could have an upgraded room prior to arrival and they did, nice surprise.Staff were very pleasant and helpful especially concierge when we asked if we could leave our luggage in the hotel after checkout whilst we visited other sites, also iv'e never seen a taxi arrive so quick when we realised we were going to miss our train, many thanks for making it a fantastic visit to London .",4,2013,11,20
115,Superb Location - Lovely Hotel,"We stayed here for two nights recently. I felt we got by London standards a good rate at booking  but when I saw the location I felt we got a bargain. The hotel has undergone a recent renovation and it is simply very smart. The lobby area is lovely and smells constantly of glorious scented candles. 

The location is a 5 min walk to covent garden, Shaftsbury avenue, soho and oxford street. Also within 5 mins is the glorious charlotte street - do not miss it. And make sure you check out ROKA. My tip for one of the best restaurants in London. Holborn Tube ( picadilly line ) is an 8min walk - i timed it. A two min cab ride if you are getting the tube from LHR. Tottenham Court tube ( central line ) is two mins walk. Overall the area is really safe. Bloomsbury is quaint and gorgeous whilst being a stones throw from all the hyper activity of the west end. It is an interesting mix.

Our room was average size - it is london - but was spotless and was tastefully decorated. I wouldnt say luxurious - more pristinely functional. Breakfast was fine - there is much on offer in the area so maybe venture out and find something. 

All in all we will be back",5,2013,11,19
115,Beautiful hotel in fabulous location.,"We have just returned from a one night stay at the Bloomsbury - fantastic! 
From the moment we walked into the lobby we felt welcome. Ben on reception was lovely and even though we arrived before 11am our room was ready.  Room was immaculate, decor lovely and plenty of space.  We were out for most of the day and upon our return the candles lighting up the steps and lobby were beautiful.  We had a drink in the bar which was nice and relaxing after the hustle and bustle of the city.
It was our anniversary and when returning to our room we had been left a complementary bottle of fizz - thank you Mikel that was so thoughtful.
Breakfast was yummy lots to choose from and we weren't rushed at all.
When checking out we were even offered a bottle of water for our journey - really nice touch.
All the staff at this hotel make you feel welcome - we would recommend this hotel and will be returning.",5,2013,11,17
115,First class accommodation but wouldn't say value for money.,"After a little trouble getting to the hotel due to the taxi driver not actually knowing it's location my partner and I found the service on check in very pleasant with being given a refreshing drink and a hot towel and above all our room actually being available early. 

The room it's self was good albeit slightly on the small side, but with a extremely soft comfortable super king size bed right in the middle of it. 

Could not fault the service elsewhere apart from the lobby bar where my friends and I were left waiting quite a while before getting served and then being told the fruit juice I ordered was out of stock. 

Overall a very nice hotel with friendly staff but we found over priced and not really value for money.  ",4,2013,11,17
115,Top marks,"Excellent all around. Very helpful, cheerful and courteous staff. Upholstery good. Pleasant lobby. Fabulous breakfast. Room size OK with good bathroom. Location awesome. Only downside, next door's hangers banging noisy. Would definitely stay again.",4,2013,11,17
115,Awesome,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury hotel for my wife's birthday... I have to say. It was fantastic, the staff were great, very friendly especially after we had a nightmare journey.  Mikel checked us in and as it was a special occasion he managed to upgrade our room, and somehow managed to get a lovely bottle of prosecco in the room.  I highly recommend the hotel as the service is top class and the food is amazing. 
",5,2013,11,14
115,Fantastic hotel,"What a lovely hotel this is. A great location and fantastic staff.
As you walk into the enormous lobby the scented candles create a wonderful atmosphere and the check-in staff were warm and courteous.
The room had everything we needed but was a little on the small side but perfectly suited us for our 1 night stay.
Excellent tea and coffee making facilities and lovely toiletries in the bathroom together with really high quality robes.
We didn't eat the the hotel but had drinks in the bar later in the evening. Again, great staff (especially Jerry) who was very friendly and chatty, and the atmosphere perfect for quiet drinks.
All in all we had a great time and I do feel that this hotel is exceptionally good value considering the service and location. We'll certainly stay again.
Thanks to all thw wonderful staff that looked after us so very well.",5,2013,11,14
115,Always a pleasure,"I often stay here and, most importantly, I often book business guests in here. Fantastic location, very welcoming staff and a very comfortable and relaxed lobby lounge. Basically, an excellent traditional hotel that knows its business and is always on its game. Yes, it can be on the pricey side but it more often than not offers better value than its two close neighbour hotels.
A small thing but I also appreciate the fact that, when I book and pay for guests, they always remember to email me a copy of the bill!",4,2013,11,12
115,Fantastic stay in a great part of London,"This hotel was great.  I stayed for 9 nights for work, and I would have stayed for another 9 nights if I could have.  The rooms was spacious for London, the area perfect (close to British Museum, awesome Indian food and a 30 second walk to the underground.)  The room was clean, well decorated (my girlfriend wanted all the tables and the headboard).  It was a very comfortable bed, and when the curtains were closed ABSOLUTELY NO LIGHT CAME IN, so I got amazing sleep.  Breakfast was included with my stay, as was a complimentary cocktail.  The housekeeping staff was very nice, and made up the room beautifully.  The hotel smells fantastic--I wish I would have asked where they get them.
The only negative was that there was a planned fire drill for staff at 11am one morning.  We were never notified--I guess they just assumed we would be up by 11am (hello first day jet-lag)  Even with the startle that caused, I am looking forward to returning.",5,2013,11,11
115,Nice,"Overall very nice, very well located, clean, service was welcoming and helpful.

On the not so good side : we were once ringed in our room at 1A.M. to pay a bill we were told could be paid at checkout...
      ",4,2013,11,11
115,"Very nice, good-location","This is a lovely hotel lots of corridors and twists & turns to get to the room but it was a good size with everything we needed, staff are very accommodating and friendly.
We only had a bar snack of chips & onion rings it was presented beautifully, we where off to Gordon Ramsay's restaurant early evening 
I would recommend this hotel, but if you like a bar it limited and was closed on our return at about 11pm :-( only just wanted to sit & take in the lovely evening didn't want to go to a crowded pub",4,2013,11,07
115,50th Anniversary Treat,"We booked two rooms at the Bloomsbury as part of a 50th Wedding Anniversary treat for our mom and dad. The location is superb - easy for Oxford St, Covent Garden, the Theatre District and central London attractions. We asked for an accessible room and got this and our own room right next door. Check in was 14:00hrs - we arrived early. One room was ready so we could use that straight away. When we returned from a trip out we had to phone for our luggage (shame it wasn't brought up) and it arrived pretty quickly. The concierge was very good - helping with Moms wheelchair and getting taxi's. The hotel rooms are very clean, tidy, well decorated and comfortable. The hotel surroundings are very good - particularly at night when much lighting is by candle. The hotel bar at LG level is relaxed and stylish - well worth a visit. Breakfast is comprehensive and there are plenty of staff for a busy service. Car Parking is a very short walk away and the hotel get a discount for residents. Overall - to be recommended.",5,2013,11,06
115,Pretty hotel in great location,"I am a Black Level award member but it was difficult to get this recognition which was disappointing. First room shown was very small, low ceiling and a window looking at a wall (room 715 I think). Eventually got the upgrade that is offered at my award level (room 614) and was happy with the new room albeit on the backside of the hotel. Comfortable bed and very clean. Bathroom nice with a rainhead shower that I apprecaite as a taller guy. Was woken up with trash collection in the back alley but as suggested by others, probably to be expected in London.

The hotel is very well located and I found a couple of very nice restaurants in the area and intersting walking. Easy walk to Soho and all the action.

Gym is okay but in the basement so no windows. A little bit of everything but in a small space. There is a big YMCA across the steet but I was not able to find out if you can get a day membership.",4,2013,11,06
115,A luxury peaceful haven,Have just enjoyed a fabulous weekend at the Bloomsbury Hotel. From the moment we arrived the staff could not do enough to help us enjoy our stay. Our rooms were exactly what we had asked for. Having stayed in other London hotels we were very pleased not to be sleeping in a broom cupboard! It is just off Oxford Street and in walking distance of theatre land. Already planning our next visit.,5,2013,11,04
115,Luxury and excellent service,"I just spent the weekend of 2-3 November at the Bloomsbury Hotel and can highly recommend it. I was in London for a jazz concert at Ronnie Scott's and wanted something within walking distance of the club. The Bloomsbury and the Montague on the Gardens were the main contenders. In the end I chose The Bloomsbury because of the positive reviews here, the menu in the Landseer Restaurant, and the architecture by Lutyens. I made the right choice.

The service from all staff - bellboy, receptionists, concierge, restaurant - was excellent. They really do listen to what their guests want. The hotel is big enough to have good facilities but small enough to keep a personal level of service. My room was a superior and a nice size, with elegant furniture. At the front of the hotel and on the 4th floor, but still very quiet with little traffic noise.

I ate in the Landseer restaurant and the quality of the food was very good. At breakfast there was a great choice of cooked meat and smoked fish - pastrami, chicken, chorizo, salami, salmon, herring - which was ideal for somebody trying to lose their sweet tooth. The hotel lobby is stunning and the renovation has tastefully kept many original features. Afternoon tea is served in the lobby and, although I did not try that, looked to be great value. I have no hesitation in recommending The Bloomsbury and will certainly stay there next time I'm in London.",5,2013,11,04
115,Lovely stay at a great hotel ,"We booked The Bloomsbury hotel for our one night stay as we were going to the theatre. We usually stay in a Doyle hotel in Dublin ( The Westbury ) which we love so were had high hopes for The Bloomsbury and it didn't disappoint! Upon arrival we were told the we had be upgraded as it was my husbands birthday and we also received a card a bottle of prosecco upon our return from the theatre which was very thoughtful and a nice touch. The room was a good size not huge but large enough, it did have a massive bed which we loved, so comfortable! Very clean and tastefully decorated. Unfortunately we only had a small window with a inner view but as we were only staying the night it didn't bother us. Bathroom was clean and fictional, sink a little on the small side, might get annoying if we were staying for longer. We decided to have a drink in the hotel bar after our show, bar was comfortable and staff very attentive however the music didn't seem to really match the ambience if that makes sense? However it didn't ruin our time there, merely an observation. Drinks were usual hotel prices and were ok, I always have a Bellini when we are away and this one was only ok, glass only just over half full so a bit disappointed in that. We pre booked our breakfast for £15 and we thought this was reasonable, we had a full English which was cooked fresh and brought to our table and I have to say it was the nicest hotel breakfast I have eaten! All hot, fresh items and eggs cooked to perfection! All in all I would recommend this hotel to any of my friends and we hope to return in the future.    ",5,2013,11,04
115,Outstanding!,"We stayed for 2 nights and booked based on TA reviews. As usual they did not disappoint as we found this hotel excellent in every way. Very attentive efficient staff, lovely ambience both in the hotel lobby and bar area. Our room was a standard double on the 7th floor. Beautiful high quality bedding, immaculately clean bathroom, lovely extra's like tea, coffee, bottled water and biscuits. Our room cost a bit more than we would usually pay for a room in London but all in all it was well worth it for our stay which was mainly to attend the theatre to see Les Miserables. It is in an ideal location for theatre land, Soho, China Town, Oxford Street etc. Would highly recommend it.",5,2013,11,03
115,Thank you to The Bloomsbury for our amazing break. Going that extra mile.,"Thanks to The Bloomsbury Hotel my partner and I had the most amazing stay. A relaxing weekend. I have stayed most hotels in London over the years even though i enjoyed myself there was never a hotel that i would turn around and say im coming back here. Well now ive found it, The Bloomsbury Hotel. Perfect. Amazing reception and welcome, was suprised to be asked if i wanted a hand towel and drink whilst i booked in!! Escorted through the lifts and whilst being overjoyed with my room the service and cleanliness, it didnt stop there. My partner and i were due to see a show and upon returning to our room we were suprised with a bottle of prosecco chilled with two glasses, truffels and a card ""To Mrs Thompson Happy Birthday complements the manager...I hadnt asked for it!! all because i said i was bringing my partner up for her birthday. Now thats what i call going that extra mile. Thats exactly what we are missing from hotels. Of course it isnt everything but it was that little touch that made me and my partner say this is going to be our hotel that we come back to again and again. Thank you Bloomsbury.",5,2013,11,03
115,Great hotel and friendly staff,"We stayed in TBH for four nights with (me and my daughter who is 8).The service is excellent, everyone is so friendly, and welcoming. The location is also great. We loved the hotel, and we will definately come back!",5,2013,11,02
115,Very fine first class hotel in superb position,"We chose this hotel for a one night stay between our railway station (Euston) and theatreland after having checked on Tripadvisor and looked at the hotel's website. It sounded grand without being pretentious, and it more than lived up to expectations. The public areas are what one would expect from a Lutyens building. Superior double room was attractively and tastefully furnished, with a marble bathroom and despite being close to Tottenham Court Road was very quiet. We returned late from our theatre feeling a bit peckish and were served an excellent club sandwich (one between 2, the waiter brought a second plate without us asking for it), just what we wanted. And not overpriced for such a good hotel in central London.

Breakfast was outstanding - see the previous post - and staff throughout the hotel were very friendly and solicitous without being annoying.

We will certainly spoil ourselves next time we visit London and stay here again!",5,2013,10,29
115,Already planning our next trip to this hotel...,"First time traveling to London on my own with my two daughters (13yrs & 21yrs) for 4nights (Oct 13 half term), so I wanted somewhere I felt safe, looked after and central- The Bloomsbury didn’t disappoint.  Firstly- the hotel itself is luxurious yet comfortable (the website really is what you see when you arrive); the warm aroma and atmosphere created from the scented candles in the entrance hall/lobby relaxes you immediately!   Staff were all incredibly attentive from the concierge, reception, restaurant and rooms service (used quite a bit- evening hot chocolate to die for!).  The one thing I love about The Bloomsbury is that although the staff are professional and helpful they really do genuinely care and will stop at nothing to ensure your stay is as best as they can make it - perfect!   The concierge –well, their wealth of London knowledge is impressive!  They couldn’t have done enough to ensure we knew where and how we were getting to our filled to the brim ‘Daily Outings’.
I love the fact we had a mixture of walking and bus travel (we purchased an oyster card) during our stay.  The Bloomsbury is in walking distance to the Theatres, British Museum, Covent Garden, Carnaby Street, Soho.  Some days we took a simple direct bus journey and we were in Harrods, Chelsea/Kensington, Natural History Museum in under  20mins.  We ate in the restaurant taking advantage of the Pre-Theatre Menu which was delicious and then went to see We will Rock You @The Dominion Theatre (feet away, literally!), by contrast we ate in The Bluebird, Chelsea similar priced set menu and The Bloomsbury knocked socks off the standard of food.
On a final note  and by no means least priority– our teenage daughter has a LIFE THREATENING NUT ALLERGY, incredibly severe and aggressive.  I emailed the hotel pre-stay.  I was emailed back from the manager (no less) who acknowledged the severity of her allergy and my request that no staff would handle/eat foods containing nuts prior to serving our daughter –all was noted.    Upon arrival and true to form, ALL staff were fully aware of the severity of our daughters allergy and restaurant/room service staff couldn’t have done enough to communicate with us foods she could/couldn’t eat.  The chef team offered to adapt any foods she wanted to ensure she wasn’t left out with her choice of food solely due to her allergy.
What more can I say, in a nutshell -The Bloomsbury Hotel is for us, “the” best hotel in London.  We will be back soon….a Christmas Shopping  Trip is on the cards!  ",5,2013,10,29
115,"Luxury comfort, Great Service and Location!","We really enjoyed our short stay in this lovely Hotel. It combined luxurious surroundings with friendly service. A large and comfortable bedroom on the sixth floor. We dined out in the evening after a theatre trip and treated ourselves to a cocktail at a very famous London cocktail bar. What a mistake! We later tried the same cocktail at the Bloomsbury which was far superior (and about half the price!) we were looked after by the charming Alina in the Landseer bar. She certainly has a talent for mixing special cocktails! 
Breakfast was a treat - next time we will dine in at the Landseer Restaurant.

Location very good for the West End and 3 or 4 minutes walk to the nearest tube station (Tottenham Court Road).
We will return!",5,2013,10,28
115,2 night stay,"we stayed here and was lovely apart from having to pay extra for breakfast
staff were lovely very clean 
very helpful would stay again 1 o'clock check out was great to 
coffee was lovely bath room very clean 
air con brill",5,2013,10,28
115,Very plush upmarket hotel in Central London,"Let me paint a picture...

Leather winged armchairs, an old library, a chapel converted into a private dining room, a bottle of whisky with morning porridge, an umbrella in the bedrooms, marble bathrooms.....need I say much more ???

Lovely rooms, good size, location just off Tottenham Court Road, 5 mins from Tube.  Excellent if you can afford it !  

Breakfast was lovely, large top quality buffet, non stop juice and coffee served to you with the restaurant staff immaculate, polished.  Beautiful bar staff all selected carefully and all dressed to impress (but with bar prices paying for those outfits). Staff served all drinks to your table, after you were seated in the leather seats, couches and with the  large cushions....yes this is luxury and sumptuous.....

Dinner was fantastic quality......god knows what it was but it was good !!!

Luckily I was here on business !!",5,2013,10,27
115,August 2013- couple stay,"Overall I was happy with my experience.  Decent size room (small in comparison to NY but good in comparison to some of the other european hotels, free internet in your room (which we did not receive at other hotels in Europe so it was definitely appreciated), staff was kind and accommodating.  I read reviews about noise issues before going, but I did not have any issues- my area was quiet and it was the middle of the summer. The neighborhood was pleasant and easy to get around to sites.

Would reccommend, just know it was a little pricier than other options.",5,2013,10,27
115,Enjoyed this hotel near the British Museum,"The room was very nice and cozy for two. Space seems like such an exotic notion in European hotels but the  bathroom area was not too small and the bed was very comfy. We were there in winter and felt warm and comfortable. The breakfasts in the cavernous lower level were tasty and big. We walked all over the city from this location and loved the choice of restaurants around. There were a couple of yummy Spanish and Morocan restaurants, and of course numerous authentic English pubs we visited. Traflagar Square was about a 15 minute walk from the hotel.
I would definitely stay here again. I thought the location was quite handy and you can pop in and out of the British Museum fairly easy towards the end of the day.",5,2013,10,26
115,A nice place to stay with caring staff and no noise,This is definitely a good place to stay. My first stay at a Doyle hotel. Stylish and very attentive staff - such a change from the standard London patter. The orginal architecture is somewhat brutal but the conversion is quite imaginative. The bedroom was very nicely furnished in a creative and underplayed manner. Nice finishes with proper slippers and bathrobes and biscuits etc. Room turndown was thorough and replenished all room supplies - very nice touch.  I could only find two things to improve: the  level of lighting in the room is inadequate for doing business work;  the towels carry the stong odour of dry cleaning - do switch to water laundry please. I would stay and again and thoroughly recommend. Thanks to all the wonderful staff.,5,2013,10,26
115,Great Location for a London stay,"Stayed at the Bloomsbury hotel in May and completely enjoyed my experience.  Very convenient to the tube station, grocery, shops, British Museum and Covent Garden.  I walked to them all.  When we checked in, the front desk asked if we would like a tour of our room.  Finding that silly we declined.  After our first evening there we realized we may need a tour for we were unable to turn on the bedside lights without the ceiling lights on as well...To find out....no tour needed...the lights are all on or all off.  Our hot water didn't come on...fixed pronto.  Our air conditioning had a little wrench displayed, fixed when we returned to our room.  Front desk great, Concierge great, Breakfast room ladies were especially nice.  We had both the continental breakfast and ordered off the menu and were quite pleased.  Overall, this is a perfect hotel to compliment fabulous London.",4,2013,10,25
115,Great staff and location for exploring London,"I hadn't stayed here for a couple of months as I had found it hard to get a room due to popularity of hotel.
It was so nice to be back the welcome is so warm from the staff and the lobby smells great!
Very luxe rooms a little small but very well appointed with charm 
Great location near tottenham court road tube and walking to covent garden",5,2013,10,23
115,Outstanding meal - half price with taste card!!,Found this hotel restaurant on the taste card and was pleasantly surprised that it offered 50% off the food bill even on a Saturday. You have to book though. The food was excellent. What you save in the food bill using a taste card you spend in the alcohol (or at least we did). All in all a very pleasant experience. Will definitely be going back. Perhaps on my 40th birthday next year. Something special.,5,2013,10,23
115,The perfect hotel for a perfect stay!,"Our family stayed in London at The Bloomsbury Hotel in mid October 2013. The weather was ""up and down"" with cold and rain, but the hotel and staff were fantastic. I travel a lot for ""business and pleasure"" and I have never had such ""over the top"" excellent professional service. The rooms were spacious and well appointed...as were the public areas. The staff's recommendations for local restaurants and points of interest was great...and their attention to detail as a ""staff and company"" left nothing to be desired. I would highly recommend The Bloomsbury Hotel to anyone looking for an above average hotel experience at a quality ""value for price"" property. We will definitely be staying there again.",5,2013,10,23
115,Perfect!,"Stayed at the bloomsbury Saturday 19th October. This was my 2nd time staying here & yet again I enjoyed every aspect of my stay here!

Upon arrival to the bloomsbury you are greeted by the most wonderful smell of scented candles & gorgeous fresh flowers, 
Check in was very quick & easy. We arrived at 11:30 so we were far to early to check into our room but left our luggage with concierge whilst we did some shopping. 
Arrived back at the hotel at 2pm, our room was ready. 

Our room (a suite) was absolutely stunning! 
Lovely big bed, which was very comfortable. 
Decorated beautifully & very much to my husband & my selfs taste. 
Amazing large mirror in the bedroom. Gorgeous comfy lounging seats and a large table perfect for all the shopping bags :-)
A selection of lights perfect for every mood. Including a dimmer switch which I personally prefer to use with lighting. 
Good selection of teas & coffee on the tea tray. We did not use the coffee machine this time but it does make fantastic coffee!
Robes & slippers are also a nice touch for when getting ready or just lounging. 
Bathroom was a very nice size with huge walk in/wet room style shower & bath tub with TV. 
The toiletries in the bathroom were very very nice. I personally never use the complementary toiletries but I forgot to bring shampoo & conditioner so used the free stuff. 
I have to say I was very impressed, smelt Devine & did not dry my hair out like most other hotel freebie toiletries. Lovely large mirror in the bathroom & also a smaller free standing magnified mirror perfect for applying makeup etc. 
There was also a very handy cosmetic/toiletry trolley in the bathroom, great for storing make up shower gel & deodorant.  I'm personally a very tidy person so this was great for me!
Hidden underneath was also a set of scales, which I thought was quite neat.

Breakfast at The Bloomsbury is perfection! It really is wonderful!
The great team they have running the breakfast in the mornings, makes everything run like clockwork. 
Shown to your table & immediately asked what hot drink you would like. 
Given the menu & asked if you would like toast. In a matter of minutes your hot drink arrives & you are offered a choice of fresh juices & shown where the continental breakfast selection is. 
The hot menu is great, offering salmon, eggs Benedict's, full English, waffles etc but my personal favourite pancakes. They have to be the best pancakes I have ever have, even beating the pancakes I've had in the USA!
Nothing is too much for the breakfast team & they will do anything they can to help you. 

I feel I must say, whilst visiting this weekend it was actually my birthday & my husband & I had planned to go out for dinner. Unfortunately my husband became unwell & spent our whole trip in bed. The hotel team could not have been more caring & helpful than what they were. Concierge were truly wonderful! 
It was actually very lovely to be asked each time they saw me how my husband was doing & if there was anything they could do. 

The location of this hotel is PERFECT! Literally just off Oxford street. And central to everything. 

The Bloomsbury for me ticks every box, and I am already looking forward to my next visit",5,2013,10,22
115,Gastvrij en comfortabel,"We arrived in Bloomsbury with our 2-years old daughter. The reception was great. To allow our daughter to have a nap, the room was made available earlier. She was treated like a princess by the staff in the lobby and even got a nice teddy, which she still cherishes today. The room was not very large, but tidy, comfortable, and cosy - with a large range of amenities. We enjoyed fine drinks in the lounge and a breakfast that was correct. We would definitely go back - both for business and for leisure. Congrats again to the staff: masters in hospitality!",5,2013,10,21
115,Grace Notes Galore,"What a lovely find!  The location superb -- a 5 minute walk to the British Museum and Oxford Street shopping.   The entire staff made my birthday celebration the best ever.  They presented my husband and me with a delicious chocolate cake, champagne and a birthday wish from the hotel manager.  Brian, the concierge handled every detail with warmth and panache.   
If you enjoy Old World style and service, this is the hotel for you.",5,2013,10,20
115,Excellent hotel!,"Excellent hotel. Staff were very friendly and cooperative. The hotel was fully booked during my stay there and in spite of that they managed to make me keep the same room for an extra night.  It's the first time that I have only positive comments. I would highly recommend this hotel to either solo travelers like me or other types of travelers (business, couples, family, friends).",5,2013,10,17
115,Loved this hotel!,"We chose to stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel for our first trip to London. It was our home base for 10 nights and it was perfect. Liked being on a quieter street, yet still very close to the essentials. Very close to tube station, and an easy walk to the theatres in the evening. Loved the candles in the entrance and lobby-such a nice atmosphere after being out touring all day! The room was very clean, the staff was very friendly, and also very helpful with our daily plans! The continental breakfast has an excellent selection and was a great way to start our day!",5,2013,10,17
115,"A nice, quiet hotel, with a GREAT STAFF","This must be the fourth time I stay at this Hotel while in London.  What brings me back is the staff. The front desk staff are extremely friendly, the concierge, this time it was Gary, will go out of his way to try and find you last minutes ticket to sold our London shows, and recommending places to go. He also remembered me from previous visits. Went down for breakfast the next morning, and was warmly greeted by Maria, who not only remembered me, but also my husband and my two boys who were with me on another trip two years ago. I was very impressed. Then there was Chris, who was so kind, brought me my double espresso and a croissant. With all honestly, Maria and Chris made my breakfast enjoyable (since I was travelling for the weekend on my own).  After a long day walking around London, I had to stop  at the bar downstairs for an appetiser and a glass of wine before going to bed, and both Orinta and Alina were great, the two nights I stayed there. The second night, they knew which wind I preferred the previous night. I will stop here, summing it all up, if I ever come to London again (solo, with kids, or just spouse or both) I will stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel because of the staff. It is the staff that make the hotel so great. Thank you so much for making my solo weekend memorable.",5,2013,10,16
115,Hotel is worth 10 stars!,"I book this hotel twice a year for business to hold training classes, and from the time you are greeted at the front door until the time you step into a cab to return home, the staff at the Bloomsbury Hotel give 150% to their customers. From my first encounter with Ana Silva in booking my training rooms, to the wonderful Husain (not sure if I have his name spelled right) who sets up our training room (I swear he can read my mind!), to the wonderful concierge staff who do all the little things for me, this hotel goes above and beyond the definition of quality customer service.  

The front desk staff are helpful with any room requirements and no matter who you see at the Bloomsbury hotel, they have a smile on their face.  I was sitting in the lobby waiting for a client and just observing everything, and this hotel has so much charm and elegance.  You see the doorman not only open the door for the guests, but also for the staff, truly a sign of professionalism.  I have nothing but good things to say about everyone and everything at the Bloomsbury Hotel.  

The food is wonderful and the bar staff are amazing. I’m not sure how many people actually work here at the hotel, but they come from all over the world and it’s wonderful to talk to all of them.  I already have my dates booked for 2014 and we are customers for life!!!",5,2013,10,16
115,Near perfect,"We stayed here mid october for one night to go and see a west end show. All the staff were very helpful and pleasant , including the gentleman who shared our lift on his way to unblock a sink!
Our room was 620 and was spotlessly clean. On our return in the afternoon they had turned down the bed, replenished the bottled water we drunk and  re tidied the room. The only Niggel we had was The mattress was ready for replacing as we found our selves rolling together in the middle , and we are only average build ,  our sleep was disturbed because of this.  The breakfast servis was also a little slow , but The quality of the food was worth the wait.
All in all excellent location , lovely decor , and good value for money.
We defiantly will recommend and return again.",4,2013,10,15
115,Stylish and Polished,We had stayed at this hotel several years ago before it was taken over by the Doyle Collection and were impressed by the dramatic changes made to the decor of the hotel.  The lobby has an exotic touch with Moroccon chandliers and furnishings.  The rooms are beautifully outfitted with luxury amenties.  There was a very high staff to guest ratio.  On checkin we were given a room with a closet but no chest of drawers.  They quickly offered us some other options with more storage.  One amenity that was not listed on their website which we used several times was their modern gym.  The hotel is located about a block from the Tube and the British museum.  We'd stay here again.,4,2013,10,14
115,Amazing Staff- Beautiful Hotel,The staff here are incredibly friendly. The front desk staff that helped us were Mikel and Rickey. They both were terrific. Very honest and kind. Great guys. Helped us with everything. Genuinely cared a lot about making sure we enjoyed ourselves.,5,2013,10,11
115,Great place to stay,_We stayed there with 9 family members. Our overall experience was excellent. The location is ideal in the heart of London. As it was in a quiet area we could sleep with the window open. The lobby welcomed us with friendly stuff and beatiful flowers and many little lit candles beautifully arranged. We were very surprised about the range of breakfast choices. Ms Estelita and her team was very friendly and helpful. Thank you for everything.,5,2013,10,10
115,An amazing building,Everything is nice about this hotel. The lobby with its original shape and decor is a must if you enjoy the style of the 30ties. You feel very welcomed as soon as you enter the front door and it is most certainly value for money.,5,2013,10,08
115,"Lovely hotel & staff, great location.","The staff were all very helpful (thankyou Kashif). The hotel has a small boutique atmosphere, a lovely foyer and very comfortable rooms. The location is great. Very close(about 10 mins walk) to Oxford Street and Soho. Bathroom very small but would stay again as rest of room very comfortable. Complimentary tea & coffee service lovely touch.",5,2013,10,06
115,"Great hotel, would definitely return.","The Bloomsbury Hotel is ideally located, all the staff were wonderful and the overall experience was excellent. We opted for the continental breakfast, there is plenty of choice and it will definitely satisfy you for a busy day around London. 
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London. ",5,2013,10,06
115,Best hotel in London so far ,"I've stayed in quite a few hotels in London, all 4 & 5 star and can't normally be bothered to write a review- good or bad, however I've been compelled to. The customer svc was excellent, nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The hotel smells great when all the candles are lit and we were even upgraded. The rooms are a little small, however as this was a base it wasn't a problem. Really clean too. Fantastic hotel. Hope to return. ",5,2013,10,05
115,The Amazing Bloomsbury Hotel,"After 2 months of travelling around Europe, my travels ended in London at The Bloomsbury Hotel where I stayed there for a week. It is the most amazing hotel that I have ever been to in the 2 months of my travel. It is situated in walking distance from Oxford Street for some serious shopping, many restaurants, hop on hop off bus tours and many of the sights that are situated near by. I felt very safe at this hotel which was very important for me as I was travelling alone. The cleanliness of my room was outstanding and was cleaned everyday once I had left the room. The staff were nothing but friendly and took the time to help me out and ensure that i knew where I was going when seeing the sights. They also organised my transport to the airport when leaving which was a spacious chauffered car. If i ever return to London which I am hoping to, I will definitely be staying at The Bloomsbury Hotel.",5,2013,10,05
115,Long weekend,Second time at this hotel and will not be the last. Location excellent. Staff wonderful nothing was to much for them  Treated ourselves to a suite and didnt want to leave. Never felt the need to comment on a hotel before but perfect home from home to supplement a perfect weekend,5,2013,10,03
115,Bloomsbury Hotel - Blooming Lovely,"Recently I was lucky enough to stay for one night in this wonderful, Doyle Collection hotel, which is located in central London, just a few minutes walk from Tottenham Court Road tube station.  Its location makes it ideal for visiting London with many options for transport, and also major visitor attractions are close by (The British Museum is further down the street & Primark around the corner on Oxford St).

Having been out for the evening with friends I returned to the hotel to find that the steps at the front door, and all down the corridor to the lift was decorated with lanterns & candles...it is quite a beautiful sight. A little fairys grotto!

The hotel is beautifully decorated, well kept, very clean, the rooms are well equipped, and all of the staff whom I met or spoke to were friendly and helpful.  At checkout I had an item from the minibar on my bill that I had not used...A quick mention to the guy serving me, and this was taken straight off the bill.

I can't comment on the food, or leisure facilities as I didnt use them, but a quick leaf through the Christmas brochure, has made me think that visiting the Bloomsbury during the festive period might be a treat to myself that I cannot resist!",5,2013,10,02
115,Birthday celebration,"We have just returned from a superb stay at the Bloomsbury hotel.
The ambience of the hotel is exceptional and the smells in all the public rooms with the floating candles w ere beautiful.
We were given a wonderful room on the 7th floor and really appreciated the bottle of prosecco delivered to us on our first night. This was a very special touch.
It was just the food that let this hotel down slightly. We decided to eat in the restaurant on our second night in the hotel and this was very disappointing. My food from the starter menu and served as a main course had to be returned as was cold and greasy. Unfortunately by the time it was delivered to me again, my husband had finished his dinner of steak and chips ! This was not exactly the romantic dinner we had hoped for !
Breakfast was good but quite expensive at 21.95 for a cooked breakfast. We expected to pay as we hadn't  booked an inclusive breakfast package. We will do in future ,the site is rather misleading when it states breakfast at 15 per head. This is for continental breakfast only.
Another glitch was when a small snack of cheese straws was ordered from the bar on the Saturday evening. This snack took over an hour to appear !!
Afternoon tea was very good !

Overall though a lovely stay. The hotel staff were so friendly and courteous and should be congratulated on their service.

Get the food right please and this hotel will be graded excellent. We would certainly return at some point as it is such an excellent location with such a super room.",4,2013,10,01
115,Nice but a little disappointing for a 4****,"We stayed in a Deluxe room for a long weekend. The hotel is very well located, perfect for shopping and for visiting the city. We were amazed by the beauty of the entrance, all the candles and the nice furnitures.
The room was nice, the bed was comfortable (despite the small size of the bed for 2). 
There were 3 negatives issues we faced. 1) the noice of the air-conditioning of the room above us during the night, 2) the mini-bar which has compartments by drawers and the items are charged directly on the room when removed. We took a drink and had a problem with the drawer and we also discovered that the cans were dirty, sticky because of the mold inside the drawer... 3) We were checked-in and checked-out by the same receptionist who was not very friendly. He was always expeditive with us, which was disappointing and unpleasant. ",4,2013,09,30
115,Wonderful!,"This was our second stay at the Bloomsbury.  After the first not so great stay...this one was wonderful!  We cannot comment on the breakfast this time around as this was not included in the package.
After spending a week in London for business, my partner flew in to spend a long weekend with me in London.  Check-in went very smooth and Ricky was outgoing and friendly: a great way to start our stay.
The room was cosy and clean.  We felt right at home.  The slight mishap with the stained bathrobe hanging in the closet was fixed by room service the next day.
On our last day we went for the Afternoon Tea.  The service provided by the staff was so warm and gracious and spoiled us.  A definite great finish to a wonderful get away weekend in London.
We will return :-)",4,2013,09,29
115,Proof that this site is a great source!,"I decided to book this hotel after I read the recommendations. Tucked into a quiet street, but near enough to walk or ""tube it"" to major sites, this place is a gem. The concierge service is excellent, the rooms are comfortable, and the  ""superior continental"" breakfast includes offerings for any taste.  I'd come again! ",5,2013,09,27
115,Loved the candles!,"We booked this hotel last minute through Hotel Tonight and were not disappointed. The room we were given was compact but well furnished, nice bathroom (although please can hotels add in a magnifying mirror). The staff were friendly and welcoming and we loved the candles. The outside bar terrace was lovely and we enjoyed a drink outside at 10 30 in the evening listening to the sounds of London.
The location of this hotel is really convenient for Oxford Street and the West End. Breakfast was excellent......so altogether no complaints and we really enjoyed our stay. Would we go back-definitely.",4,2013,09,27
115,Fantastic,"I booked this hotel as a treat for my husbands birthday as I was taking him to a football match in london. Unfortunately the day of the match changed and we couldn't  go, but decided to have a few days in london anyway. Well, all I can say is within a few minutes of entering, all disappointment was forgotten. This hotel is immaculate, food fantastic and smells delightful but what sets it above the rest is  the staff. They are amazing!!! After a very pleasant check in and a chat with the receptionist we arrived in our room to find a complimentary bottle of sparkling rose and a birthday card. We couldn't believe it and were delighted.  The next morning we had a fantastic breakfast served by the friendliest staff and a read of the complimentary papers before heading out. On the way I asked the concierge about theatre tickets etc. He went way beyond his  duties and sent us off full of optimism and loaded with info. We had the best day we've ever experienced in london thanks to him and we were genuinely sorry to leave the following day.   This hotel has a very traditional style, but incorporates the modern world flawlessly, even down to the Apple Macs for guests in the foyer and nespresso machines in the rooms.  I can still smell all the different scents from the floating candles placed throughout.  To sum up, If you want to stay in a beautiful central  hotel and feel more relaxed and welcomed than you ever have before, then this is the hotel for you. My husband and I are still talking about it and can't wait to go back before 
Christmas. The management have thought of everything to make this hotel amazing and I can't thank all the staff enough for making our  break perfect. ",5,2013,09,27
115,Really really perfect hotel.,"It was great. It is hard to make me happy. But I really appreciated. Definetly if I go to london again I will choose The Bloomsbury Hotel. I don't have any relationship with The Bloomsbury Hotel group. So, trust me and stay there if you wanna realy enjoy London. By the way, hotel smells so nice. ",5,2013,09,27
115,AAAAAAAAAmazing Hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The location of this fabulous hotel is perfect and is only a short walk to Soho, The British Museum. The Tottenham Court Road Tube Station is also super near and very convenient. My partner and I stayed in a beautiful Deluxe Room for three nights in late August which was spacious and comfortable. The room was beautifully designed, contemporary, warm and cozy with great amenities such as complimentary still and sparkling water bottles, a shinny nespresso machine, biscuits, bathrobes and a docking station.

The staff were the most polite and accommodating I have come across in some time (I travel extensively).Every perosn working in the hotel was smiling all the time.The continental breakfast buffet was presented beautifully with an awesome selection of pastries, croissants, local jams, cheeses, fruits and tiny smoothies. They also offered variety of hot breakfast to order. I opted for the full English breakfast option. I tried the Full Breakfast on the first morning and it was delicious. My partner enjoyed the eggs benedict and the americano coffee was perfect.

We enjoyed afternoon tea in the hotel on day 2.It had not been planned but when we passed several other guests eating we had to take a look at the menu. It tasted so good!! Great value and the attention to detail was outstanding. This hotel I have to say was one of the best I have stayed in in  some time. It is a hidden Gem. I can’t speak enough of it. If you are planning a trip to London stay in The Bloomsbury Hotel. I don’t usually write comments on trip advisor but on this occasion I felt I had too!",5,2013,09,24
115,A hidden gem,"After booking this hotel and researching how close to Tottenham Court Road station was, I was slightly worried it would be in a loud, lively location. It is only 5 minutes away from the tube station but is hidden away on a quiet street.

The room décor was nice, modern and simple. Comfortable bed with just the right amount of wardrobe space. Bathroom was amazing. Most importantly it was clean. Tea and coffee making facilities available in the room.

This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. Undisturbed nights sleep which is something that I have found very hard to accomplish in many hotels.

Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely return.",5,2013,09,24
115,"beautiful hotel, but don't forget the basics!","A strong hot shower surely is not that difficult? After our friendly complaint to reception, nothing changed, a weak lukewarm shower is all that could be delivered. Staff were lovely, but unfortunately on the 5th floor they open and let slam hallway service doors from early in the morning, repetitively. Fix the heavy doors, you are in hotel where people are trying to rest - bizarre.
Overall very nice, but don't forget why I am here.  I am paying the bill to rest peacefully and to come in out of the cold to a nice hot shower. Too hard it seems.",3,2013,09,24
115,Lovely building. Full service high quality hotel. Fantastic location,"Beautiful exterior and impressive entrance hall. The staff were very helpful. Some of the rooms were a bit small, but reasonable for London. Quality restaurant. Amazing location for Coventry Garden and Oxford St.",5,2013,09,21
115,Afternoon tea at the Bloomsbury,"My wife and I spent a fantastic 2 hours at the Bloomsbury on 12th September after visiting the Pompeii Exhibition at the British Museum. For under £20 at a London hotel it was not only excellent value but the quality could be felt throughout the Lutyens dining room and facilities. The service was first class, and we were not hurried out (as was the case at the Ritz a couple of years ago). We had a sofa, loads to eat and as much tea as we could drink. We sampled the 'facilities' and they were also excellent. Other local tea establishments will need to up their game to compete on price and location... We will definitely return...",5,2013,09,19
115,Outstanding service and flawless attention to detail,"The hotel exterior does not scream excess with tacky extravagance and that’s what makes this hotel beautiful and elegant. The location is perfect, only a short walk to Soho, British museum, Tottenham Court Road and Holborn station. Super easy when you take the tube from Heathrow to Holborn (only one short stairs down from the train to exit).
We stayed at room 206 with big windows facing west onto a small street. We were on vacation and wanted to see other room options for more pleasant London trip so the hotel staff allowed us to see several rooms that are available that day. One of the room located on the upper floor was much bigger but the windows are a bit small and the other room available was facing the courtyard, I was happy with room 206. The room was beautifully designed, contemporary, warm and cozy with great amenities such as complimentary still and sparkling water bottles, Nespresso machine, tea, cookies, bathrobes, umbrella and ihome. 
The staff are very nice, polite and accommodating. The turndown service with a nice little surprise was delightful. We had afternoon tea at the Lutyens lounge, it was fantastic and relaxing. The continental breakfast buffet was presented beautifully with good selections of pastries, croissants, local jams, cheeses, fruits and many more. They also offered variety of breakfast to order menu for the full English breakfast option. I tried the waffles with maple syrup and full English breakfast and they are very good.  
It may seem like I’m promoting the hotel so much but I just love it there. I can’t wait to go back to London and stay at The Bloomsbury again.",5,2013,09,18
115,The Bloomsbury Hotel,"I stayed here with my husband in September and got a really good last minute deal on the room (less than half usual price). On arrival we couldn't have had a nicer welcome. Every staff member couldn't have been more helpful. The hotel itself is beautiful and our individual room was modern, clean and really cosy. We had a drink in the downstairs bar which was beautifully lit with great service.
The Bloomsbury Hotel is perfectly placed for Oxford Street and all it's surrounding facilities.
I would definitely stay here again - and pay the usual higher price - well worth it.",5,2013,09,17
115,Comforting stay,"During our family vacation to Europe, my husband booked us a stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel. It was a very, very enjoyable stay! We experienced very friendly and helpful staff - notably the restaurant hostess Estrellita - and were offered very large, comfortable rooms. It was extremely relaxing to retreat to this hotel, following a busy day out in the 'Big Smoke'.",4,2013,09,17
115,My favourite hotel in London,"I love this hotel, it is like a second home to me. I have stayed an average of 1-2 night per week in this hotel for the past 4 years. Initially I stayed only for business trips but I like it so much that now I stay there also on private trips. The hotel is excellent, extremely beautiful and elegant, really modern rooms and the friendliest staff you can find in London. A truly luxury hotel. And the location could not be better, at the heart of London, literally next door to the British Museum, Oxford Street and Soho, and walking distance to Leichester Square, Trafalgar Square and all other attractions. Room service is very good, although if you go too often it does not have enough variety, but I guess no place does. Great value for money. I strongly recommend this hotel to anyone going to London, either for business or leisure.",5,2013,09,15
115,Excellent repeat trip,"This was our third annual visit, and we hope to return again.  Service was excellent, especially the breakfast restaurant staff and hostess Estrellita. Location is great and rooms relatively large for London and nicely appointed.  The only quirk we found is that each year there seems to be a new procedure which has resulted in inconsistencies in the bill.  Every time the discrepancies have been straightened out promptly, but vigilance by the guest is a good idea.  Overall, this hotel is a lovely oasis in a high-energy city, and we look forward to future stays.",5,2013,09,12
115,A Real Touch of Class,"First-rate experience. Greeted warmly, and the staff had arranged for a bottle of champagne to be waiting in the room for my wife's birthday. Dinner in the hotel was wonderful - -staff were able to answer menu questions, and the wine list was extensive. Brian, the concierge, was very helpful in arranging cabs and offering suggestions for places to visit. The hotel's location, next to the British Museum and near Covent Garden was ideal.  Good bar, and the Seamus Heaney library was a nice touch.

We simply could not have asked for a better place to stay during this quick (too quick) trip to London and we will certainly stay here again.",5,2013,09,12
115,21st birthday surprise tea.,"My best friend brought me to Bloomsbury Hotel for a birthday surprise tea. The moment we walked into the hotel, staff greeted us with great warmth. The food and service was nothing short of perfection. 
The head of concierge, Brian made the entire experience even more special. Once he was aware of my birthday, I was treated to a glass of champagne, a rendition of 'happy birthday' and even a little gift. 
It was a perfect day and I will definitely be recommending this to anyone and everyone!",5,2013,09,11
115,Lovely wedding night stay,"My husband and I stayed on our wedding night last Friday. Lovely luxury hotel with a spacious room and fantastic staff. We came back to find our room decorated with rose petals and the staff went out of their way to make our stay special. Will be coming back for our anniversary! 

The location is great for visiting the British Museum, Oxford Street etc and the hotel location is at the quieter end of Great Russell Street so not noisy at all. I stay in a lot of hotels for work but this has been the nicest stay in London so far. If you want to spend a bit more and stay in a luxury hotel this is a great choice.",5,2013,09,11
115,Great stay,"I have never left a hotel  review before but felt I must do so on this occasion because we were  so impressed with the hotel,  the attentive staff, and the value for money that this hotel offered.  We were most impressed with the complimentary champagne when we used the bar to celebrate my wife's birthday  and the free  bottle of bubbly in an ice bucket they snuck into  our room while we out.  No need to spend hours searching / reading reviews  anymore -  we will definitely use this hotel for our next visit to London",5,2013,09,10
115,Excellent stay,I stayed at the Bloomsbury hotel for 2 nights with my partner and we had a lovely stay. The location is perfect for shopping and transportation. The service was excellent especially Brian at the concierge who gave us great tips about things to do in London as we didn't know London so well. Thank you for the well recommended restaurants and tours. We hope to come back soon and when we do we will stay here again.,5,2013,09,09
115,A Memorable Weekend,"My wife and I spent two nights at The Bloomsbury over the August bank holiday weekend in celebration of our wedding anniversary, where we were booked into a superior room.  From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very welcome.  Both the concierge and front desk staff were extremely polite and friendly.  We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived at our room.  It was well designed and spacious, with a bathroom that housed both a bath tub and a generous shower cubicle.

The bar and restaurant staff were all very friendly and accommodating, and the food was excellent, breakfast included.  We ended up dining in the restaurant on both nights of our stay as opposed to eating out.

The location of The Bloomsbury was excellent as both my wife and I enjoy a bit of shopping.  Although we live in London and have frequented the West End on many occasions, we were a bit apprehensive about staying in Town, but make no mistake! It was a totally different experience, one which we will remember for a long time and we enjoyed every moment it.

Thank You very much Bloomsbury.  Truly a wonderful hotel.

Mr A Alexander",5,2013,09,09
115,The Bloomsbury Hotel - Now my favourite hotel!!!,"The location of the The Bloomsbury Hotel is excellent, being just around the corner from Tottenham Court Road Tube Station & Oxford St.

The hotel and its staff are outstanding. The staff were friendly, responsive and respectful; and genuinely so.  The hotel foyer and rooms are beautiful and comfortable.  The, refreshing face whipes, bottles of water and the lemonade and iced tea in the foyer were a really nice touch.  They even gave our little boy, Jakob a hotel teddy bear to keep! Everything worked - no blocked drains, no IT issues...nothing. The wifi was fast, the in-room coffee machine a real treat!. I would HIGHLY recommend the hotel to anyone.",5,2013,09,08
115,wonderful hotel,Just returned from a 2 night stay at the wonderful Bloomsbury Hotel perfect location wonderful staff and lots of little touches in room turn down service and a teddy bear for my grand daughter hope to return soon.,5,2013,09,06
115,"Stayed here a few times, great location","This s a reliable place I use frequently as it is near our office, just off Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street so very handy.
Nicely done rooms with good bathrooms & beds, good service, didn't use the restaurant this time but it is decent and worth trying.
Will return soon, no doubt.",4,2013,09,05
115,Great hotel in a superb location with the bet staff.,"We stayed in this hotel from ayg 22-26 (2 adults in our 30s and a 3 year old). We booked a superior room. Maybe were used to much larger rooms in dubai but in London the small rooms are normal - and actually compared to Europe the rooms were not that small. Very nice and modrn decor in room. Really like it. Exceptionally clean (and that's the most important thing to me!)The location is just great!!! Very near to covent garden and oxford. The hotel has a lot of amazing review on TR and now we know why.
We never encountered any staff who are that helpful and friendly AND love what they're doing - they're not faking and you feel it.
All the staff! On the bar, conceirge., reception! Every single one of them!!
Thank you so much Bloomsburry for making our stay wonderful. (we were also upgraded :))
Nothing was too much for you!

",5,2013,09,05
115,Great Trip!,"The hotel was very nice and is centrally located to sites, shopping and restaurants. A little pricey but the location allows you to avoid spending money on cab fare as everything is within walking distance.
      ",4,2013,09,04
115,A truly mixed bag,"Another reviewer wrote the following about their arrival here:
“One problem we found up front was the set of stairs leading up to the entrance door. This requires a bit if effort if you have heavy cases. We observed quite a few people struggling up and down the stairs during our stay and the hotel has helpfully placed a sign asking people not to roll bags up and down the stairs to avoid damage. One problem is perhaps that the doormen can't see people approaching ás they seem to stay firmly inside the hotel in cooler weather.”
In our case, the weather was fine, and I would expect doormen to watch out in all weather.   This hotel entrance is NOT at street level -- you MUST ascend the stairs. (There appears to be an unappealing handicap entrance around one side, but we did not approach it.)  The first 4 times I entered or re-entered the hotel, I never saw any hotel staff outside the building, or appearing to watch for arrivals at all.  On our third night, we suddenly saw doormen who seemed to be in attendance.   On arrival, once we had wrestled the bags up and inside, then someone offered to help us with our bags (no, thank you).  We were annoyed and this was cast a shadow over our arrival. You should not stay here if you have any mobility issues or lack of strength with your bags. 
My overall impressions are these:  beautiful hotel, tastefully decorated, fantastic location, our room was quiet, good-sized and good looking (Room 511).  However, we had many frustrations, omissions, and service problems.
ASK for help with the lights and electricity in your room.  This may be obvious to some but we were baffled.  Eventually it turned out you put your key card in a slot just inside your room, but this was not explained.  The power strip just over the desk is quite confusing as well.  No one offered to take us up, although this is probably due to what happened upon our arrival.   Lighting switches in the room extraordinarily complicated.  Could not turn on or off one of the bedside lights without planning as to wall switches and much experimentation.  
Big confusion upon our arrival about our rate, luckily I had printouts from our reservation showing the rate we should be charged.  There is a big “hold” put on your credit card for “incidentals”, beyond the actual room rate.  In the end, our charges were as expected.  Be sure to have printouts or records of any reservation details. 
There was a STEP just inside the door to the hall.  Those with mobility issues should ask are there any steps I will have to take?
Restaurant is in the basement and not even near the elevator.  It appeared abandoned to us.  Not inviting.  There was a bar in the main hotel lobby, but it is 100% hidden from view.  We literally did not know it was there until the last minutes of our stay.  Tip:  upon entering main doors, turn right then turn right again.  Bar area is very small but they do offer drinks in the pretty lobby.  No one told us and there is no sign.  Missed opportunity.
Bathroom tub/shower is very tight.  The area near showerhead is exceedingly narrow and inside of the tub was shaped like a coffin (wider at the head, narrower at the feet), making it very tricky to use.  We are average sized people.  Only towel racks are IN the shower.  One plus is the bathroom mirror does not fog.  
Cleaning staff very nice, but appeared quite frightened when I asked a question.  Concierge did try to help me with my car hire reservation.  Hard to give a service rating since some people were nice and helpful, but the arrival issue needs serious attention (reason for my ""poor"" rating).
I have more issues but realize I will sound like one of “those people”.  Honestly we thought the hotel was very pretty, with a great location, and our room was quiet and nice insofar as we could work it.  It is very close to a Boots store, and not far from coffee shops and the Tube stop for Tottenham Court Road.",3,2013,09,03
115,Great location and great British service.,Excellent desk staff and more than excellent concierge service. Rooms are a bit small but adequate.  Loved our stay in London. Around the corner from the tube. London is much like NYC in that their subway system can get you anywhere. Hotel is almost across the street from the British Museum,4,2013,09,03
115,Beautiful Central London Hotel,"We stayed at The Bloomsbury Hotel for two nights after a week exploring Scandinavia.  What a treat to end the trip in such convenient luxury!  The rooms are spacious, the decorating is up-to-date, and the location is absolutely perfect for walking to all kinds of London attractions.  The British Museum is a few steps down the street, and the theater district, fine restaurants and art museums are within walking distance.  And if you happen to be an artist, just step across the street to L Cornelissen & Son, where you will find a wonderland of quality art supplies.  It all adds up to a brilliant stay in London, with The Bloomsbury Hotel as a home base . . . lovely!",5,2013,09,03
115,A few days stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel and Sightseeing in London,"This is an excellent hotel - within walking distance to lots of popular attractions and is on the same street as the British Museum.  The trip was a sightseeing 'expedition' for the sights of London Eye, The Tower, Big Ben and lots of others and this hotel is not far from any of them.  So, excellent for underground etc.  Also if you want to hit the shops.

Apart from the hotel being excellent, the staff were amazing.  Very very helpful.  And.. it was my Grandsons's 13th Birthday and we had dinner in the Restaurant and they even baked a 'special birthday cake' and we had a round of free drinks!  Not many hotels would do that!

The suite that we stayed in was also absolutely fantastic with plenty of space and an old styled claw foot bath - what a delight!

Would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2013,09,03
115,Amazing Home Away from Home,"We travel to London and the UK frequently.  Usually we can't wait to get out of London.  The hotels are usually cold, dirty and too expensive for the value received.  This hotel is a remarkable exception!  We extended our stay and came back for two additional stays during our travels to recharge.  They were amazing with our kids.  Gary and Brian (concierge staff) helped to arrange not one but two Football games for my husband and son.  Johnathan in the lobby bar entertained and nourished ;-) my mom, my 6 year old daughter and myself.  The entire staff is top notch.  I feel bad I can't name them all.  The rooms were fabulous and very comfortable.  Very elegant but not overdone.  Love the facecloths!  Hard to find and essential to bathing children!  Thank you Bloomsbury!  We can't wait to come back! See you soon!",5,2013,09,02
115,Excellent hotel.,"My wife and I have just returned from a two night stay at this wonderful hotel. The trip was a short sightseeing type break without the kids. The location of this establishment is brilliant, walking distance to lots of the popular attractions. It is on the same street as the British museum and just around the corner from the Dominion theatre that is showing ""We will rock you"" which is an awesome musical. The hotel is probably only one mile or so from Euston train station which is either a £6 taxi journey, or just over a 15 minute walk.
The ambience of the hotel is excellent it is very relaxing and tranquil. The place is very clean with good facilities. The decor is quite grand in the lobby, and I found the rooms to be very contemperous. 
For me the best overall part is the staff, they are all very friendly and efficient. I don’t wish to single any one member out because they are all great. However special mention to Brian who is one of the concierges’. Please do not hesitate to book a stay at this hotel. We look forward to returning soon. Many thanks indeed to all concerned.",5,2013,08,31
115,Lovely elegant  comfortable,I had visit London with my daughter for a few terrific days. The hotel  supply a lovely stay in elegant beautiful room and surroundings. we met a helpfull frofessional nice staff. The breakfast was exalent. Irena from breakfast was so attentive and assisting. Defiantly will come back. ,5,2013,08,31
115,Excellent.Would certainly go back,"I booked this hotel as a surprise present to celebrate my husband's birthday and wanted it to be special and it certainly was. The hotel is in an ideal location within walking distance of lots of attractions. The staff are welcoming, friendly and professional and nothing was too much trouble for them.Breakfast was wonderful with a great choice. We were even given an upgraded room and a bottle of bubbly to celebrate the occasion. 
Would thoroughly recommend the hotel.",5,2013,08,30
115,Thank you Chris,"We, seven people in all, stayed in the hotel for a whole week and the hotel fulfilled all our expectations - excellent location, nice decor, good ambience, close to tube and plenty of bus lines,......we had a good stay for the whole week. Most of the staff was polite and helpful. Air-conditioning was good. A special mention to Chris, who served us breakfast every day and had been excellent and attentive. You can tell he enjoys his work and feel happy by giving his customers satisfaction. 

There are slight draw backs in the hotel. One night I was woken up by the noise from the next room at 3am. Apparently there were weak points in the room insulation. But when we reported to the front desk we were given another room at the end of the corridor and had quiet sleep afterwards. 

One more comment is that the choice of food for breakfast isn’t such a wide selection though healthy. It may be ok for people who stay a few nights but for us, seven days of cereal and boil eggs…..I think I will stay off boil eggs for quite a while.",4,2013,08,30
115,Lovely!,"I was booked into this hotel initially for business, and then stayed for personal time - I really loved it - location wise the hotel is close to Soho, Covent Garden, various theatres and Oxford Street,  just for starters -the tube station is conveniently located just around the corner - the staff and service were lovely - breakfasts, high tea were great in particular - rooms were beautiful and spotless - it was a really enjoyable experience which I will do again!",5,2013,08,30
115,"An oasis of calm, tranquility and luxury - beyond outstanding","My wife and I stayed for one night to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It seemed like the staff knew somehow as the level of service, attention and sheer specialness that we experienced was beyond outstanding. It is a unique hotel in location and atmosphere for the leisure guest. They have managed to evoke a bygone age where manners, service and quality still genuinely count.",5,2013,08,30
115,Great location for shows in the west end next to Oxford street had a fabulous time would recommend,"Great hotel right next to Oxford street very close to the west end would recommend this hotel to anyone who is stopping in London can't wait to go back , tube station round the corner from hotel , the british museum on the same road all in all a great location for exploring London , mark d",5,2013,08,29
115,Well positioned,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel earlier this year and although it wouldn't have been my first choice, I found this hotel very well positioned for all sorts of attractions such as The British Museum, Ronnie Scotts Jazz Club, many theatres, Covent Garden, and the stores of Oxford/Regent St etc.  

The room we were allocated wasn't very big, but was very nicely decorated, had a really nice bathroom, flat screen TV and felt very cosy.  

The breakfast area/restaurant was very pleasant and we had the pre-theatre special menu on one of the nights which was very good value. 

For a London hotel, the Bloomsbury was a friendly establishment to which we would readily return - although maybe in a slightly bigger room!",4,2013,08,28
115,Blooming good,"This Hotel was selected for its perceived quality and location. We were visiting for a long weekend to see The Bolshoi Ballet at Covent Garden. We were not disappointed in either respect, the location was within easy walking distance of the key tourist attractions in Central London including the maze of little shops and boutiques north of the ex Covent Garden Market site itself. The British Museum was 5 minutes away. The Hotel was quality throughout with a very impressive foyer, the bedroom was luxuriously appointed, quiet and comfortable. The front of house staff were excellent and attentive with a desire to please, to the extent that (nice touch this) we were given two bottles of iced water the minute we set foot inside-very welcome to hot and weary travellers just arriving. Price of a full breakfast was a little high at over £20 but there were some items included, we hav'nt been offered anywhere else. All in all thoroughly recommended we will certainly return.",4,2013,08,27
115,Gets better every time we stay,"We have been staying at The Bloomsbury Hotel in Great Russell St, London since September 2001 when it was part of the Jury's Chain. We then worked in the UK but have now returned to live in Melbourne but go back regularly.   Now renamed it belongs to The Doyle Collection.  It was always gracious and welcoming but now it is classy and worthy of any visitor.  It is my idea of a comfortable hotel with top class service and amenities.  The Conscierge Department's Brian and his offsider Gary (and the team) are wonderful.  Nothing is too much trouble.  From the time they take your luggage on arrival to the time they say farewell you are treated like a friend.  Theatre tickets are produced almost as soon as you enquire and Gary even stood in line to get a ticket for The Pompeii Exhibition for me early one morning before he started work.  That's dedication.  As we were staying for eight nights as part of our 50th Anniversary celebrations we were upgraded for the whole time and this made the stay even more perfect.  Thanks to all at The Bloomsbury for a memorable stay.  Food in the dining room is even better than it used to be (and it was always delicious).  We will be back asap.",5,2013,08,27
115,Best place I've stayed in a long time,"I've recently stayed at the Bloomsbury hotel and found my stay incredible! I was deeply impressed with the attention to detail staff offer to meeting needs of guests and going that extra mile! I stayed for my boyfriend's birthday and mentioned it was a special occasion, immediately our room got upgraded from a standard to an amazing deluxe! The room was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean! As we entered our room we had been given a bottle of complementary champagne and 2 home made deserts, this made us feel as guests special as it is an extremely kind gesture from the hotel. We decided to try the breakfast in the morning which was in a beautifully decorated room with calming music- perfect for the morning ! The breakfast can seem pricey but as soon as it arrives its worth it the buffet is £15 and the cooked breakfasts were £22 tea, coffee and juice is offered as soon as your mug/glass is empty! Staff are polite and very helpful! I hope this review encourages people to visit this hotel as I left with a very big smile on my face as I felt every thing was fantastic!! ",5,2013,08,26
115,"Excellent Service, Location, Ambiance and Food!","Having recently stayed at the Bloomsbury I would like to thank all the staff for making our stay so wonderful. We had a beautiful room the bed was so comfy didn't want to leave! The staff were very friendly and helpful and the food was well presented and tasted great. We visited various locations nearby which were easy to travel to by tube or on foot including the V & A Museum, the London Aquarium, the London Eye, Oxford St, Trafalgar Sq and Covent Garden. Thank you all very much.",5,2013,08,24
115,Weekend away,"We stayed here for two nights in August and found it was a perfect location for walking out to the sites of London; we did the Natural History, Science and V&A Museums, Hyde Park, Covent Garden, Trafalgar, National Portrait Gallery, Tate Modern and a few other bits and pieces. Best of all the British Museum was just around the corner. Defintiely recommend this place as a convenient and comfortable spot to rest during a weekend away. The breakfast was amazing!",5,2013,08,23
115,Great Location,"I stayed there with my family and also with a friend for 9 days.  I chose it because it is incredibly convenient to 2 major tube lines, (just off Oxford Street) British Museum and West End shows. (Soho and Carnaby street as well) The staff was wonderfully helpful and the wi-fi free and in working order at all times. (which is a major plus for me!) The rooms are small but well appointed and the beds super cozy. I stayed in the family room (which had a large fantastic tub and bathroom) and a double room with my friend when the kids were at camp. We would have slept until noon if we didn't set the alarm. We walked around the corner to Cafe Rouge for breakfast every day before we hopped on the tube for out day out. Do look up shows that are on limited runs - we saw Dan Radcliff in the Cripple if Innishman that was only on for 6 weeks- and Black Swan Reloaded (on for 4 days)- possibly one of the best dance performances I have every seen and I live in New York City! If you want to chance it - tix are 10 pounds 2 hours before the show and are almost always house seats.",5,2013,08,21
115,Great staff - great location - nice hotel,"We were looking for a good hotel situated close to Tottenham Court Road and Bloomsbury Hotel is what we found and booked. The hotel itself is great, very helpful staff, location superb in a rather quiet street but still only 10 minutes walking from Oxford street, the main shopping street.
The standard rooms are very tasteful, nice decoration and big enough for two. What was a bit annoying was the mini bar/refrigerator that made quite some noize and I had no idea how to turn that off. 
Tip: very nice and yummie lemonade in the lobby of the hotel!!",4,2013,08,21
115,Lovely!!,"Stayed here for 3 nights. It did not disappoint in any area. Service and staff were exceptional from the time we arrived. We were greeted at the taxi and escorted to the lobby where refreshing drinks were offered. After a long flight and traveling with family, nothing beats walking into a hotel with such warm reception. It felt like the staff were waiting for us to arrive. The check in process was easy and we had some time to just sit in the lobby over a cool drink to catch our breath and talk to the staff about our upcoming days in London. I was so busy before leaving, I did not have a chance to plan. I was so grateful to the staff who helped develop our sightseeing itinerary and provided some great shopping tips. 

The room was quiet, internet access worked immediately, beds were comfy, the breakfast spread was amazing (time extended on weekends for late risers)! The guidance from staff was spot on with restaurant and sight seeing recommendations. After one of our long days, we ordered room service and received a delicious meal. 

Great location and time in London, will definitely return!!",5,2013,08,20
115,Wonderful hotel in London,"Great Service, convenient location for British Museum, local pubs, and can walk to theatre district.
Staff goes out of its way to be accommodating.  Beds comfy but no king-size available.  All in all pretty good value when breakfast is included.",5,2013,08,20
115,Perfect luxury weekend,"My girlfriend and I live in London but wanted to give ourselves a treat for the weekend. The Bloomsbury delivered in every possible way, nothing was too much trouble for them. The location is perfect, allowing us to go out on Friday night and easily walk back. We ate in the Landseer restaurant on the Saturday - hands down one of the best meals I've ever had! Our room (523) was stunning. Highly recommend this place for visitors...or even Londoners looking for a treat!",5,2013,08,19
115,Very helpful staff,"I had booked a three night stay at this hotel. However some mistake with the actual amount of nights and got sent over to their sister property The Marlebone. They were very helpful and got us a taxi, helped with luggage and even paid for the cab. Afternoon tea here is a real treat and the restaurant is lovely. Would recommend to a friend without hesitation.",4,2013,08,18
115,Brilliant Staff,"We stayed for 2 nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  We chose the hotel because of it's brilliant reviews and value for money; we were not disappointed.  
Every member of staff was courteous, friendly, attentive and helpful.  In particular, a bar tender named Jonathan went above and beyond for us and we felt like we had made a friend.
The lobby was very grand and swish.  Our room was extremely clean and had everything we needed. It was also very quiet at night and we had a very peaceful night's sleep.  The air conditioning was a welcome bonus.
The breakfast was lovely and we were attended to very swiftly.
We found the location of the hotel brilliant for all parts of central London.  We didn't need the tube and took the odd taxi.
We will definitely stay again.  
Many thanks x",5,2013,08,18
115,Amazing!,"I booked a night at this hotel because of its location. This was a birthday surprise for my partner. I chose this hotel as it was walking distance to the theatre we were going to. On arrival we checked in and we were so lucky that we got upgraded to a deluxe room. Very very happy with this. The gentleman behind the counter was friendly and helpful. The hotel its self is very elegant on the inside but on the outside you would never know. On arrival into our room, there was nothing that I could moan about, the room size was great two comfy chairs and a nice size bathroom with a king size bed. Very happy so far. I did email the hotel previously to my stay to let them know that it was my other half's birthday. To my surprise, we had a knock at the door and champagne delivered with a note from the duty manager wishing my partner happy birthday! WOW!!!  Thank you! Slept well in the hotel which was nice and quiet. We also opted for the turn down service this was also a very nice touch. Went down for breakfast and had the continental. My partner and I enjoyed this and there was plenty to choose from, the food was very good quality along with the welcoming staff. I would definitely recommend this hotel, I just wish I could have stayed longer.",5,2013,08,18
115,Lovely hotel,An excellent location on a quiet side street in Bloomsbury just a block or two away from the British Museum and a short walk to the theatre district. The decor is lovely and the staff was exceedingly courteous and helpful. The concierges were a huge help to us since we had never been to London before. I would recommend to anyone. Thank you for a wonderful stay.,5,2013,08,17
115,Staying in London? Stay here!,"We only had one night in London but this hotel was excellent at every point: bell boys courteous and helpful whilst remaining in the background not in your face, reception staff quick efficient, helpful and extremely polite, hotel public areas clean, tidy and interesting - little things like free drinks in reception for the hot and thirsty traveller were most welcome, hotel rooms with everything you need from quality toiletries to Nespresso coffee machine. 

Late night bar downstairs is a secret delight, a few of us down there including a charming Scot and his wife (England v Scotland at Wembley) enjoyed drinks from the skilful cocktail lady together with free nibbles. 

The full Irish is to be recommended, absolutely delicious and once again the staff all went the distance to make sure that all was well.

Truly could not fault this hotel and will be the first call next time we are in London",5,2013,08,17
115,A top anniversary stay,"I booked this hotel because I loved the design, traditional yet stylish. It was for my Wedding Anniversary so wanted something special and also close to the Theatre in Alwych. When I booked direct I spoke to a lovely Irish lady and after explaining my needs I was booked into a room. Upon arrival to my delight we were able to get a room upgrade to an Executive suite, the lady on reception that morning (10th) was more than accommodating and lovely. We were given a free bottle of wine in our room (which was spacious, elegant and gorgeous) and amazingly I asked about the candle in reception which had the most beautiful smell and I was given one. I would love to stay here again and didn't want to leave, the staff are more than helpful and friendly, my husband and I really loved this hotel, and would like to thank the receptionist's for making our stay a memorable one.",5,2013,08,15
115,Thank you,"I had mentioned in our booking that we were staying here for our honeymoon.  As a result, we were upgraded to a better room and a complimentary bottle of champagne was left in our room.  It was a lovely touch and made our stay special.  The location is excellent and the lobby very nice - the rooms are a bit small, but this is London...",5,2013,08,14
115,superb couldn't ask for more  Bernie123,"We stayed at the hotel for just one night but we had the best service you could possibly ask for. the hotel organised tickets for "" We will Rock you"" for us on request and as we arrived we where greeted by the duty manager with a big friendly smile and our tickets. check in was very friendly and smooth as where all the front of house staff. 
The room was very clean, spaces and light.
We had a meal in the Landseer Restaurant prior to the show and this set of the evening to a brilliant start. the a la carte menu gives a great selection of innovative but yet classic dishes. i had a steak that was cooked to perfection and the chicken roulade dish on the pre-theater menu with the risotto was just divine.we didn't  have desserts as time was running out so we where offered to come back after the show for coffee and desserts. well, that just finished the evening of perfectly.The only negative comment i could think of was that the rolls for dinner seem to be a little under cooked and no choice in either white or brown roll. if that was the only thing then its not a problem.  Maria the restaurant supervisor and her team just couldn't do enough for us and  all credit to chef Paul and his team for delivering such great food. when in London again i will stay at the Bloomsbury hotel without question.  Thanks a lot for a great time!!",4,2013,08,14
115,Fabulous!,"Took my mum just for one night to celebrate her birthday and we thought it was fabulous! Gorgeous lobby, great reception staff. Room was beautiful and even though an internal view was still light. Extra touches - good quality toiletries in bathroom, nespresso machine, a fruit plate and cakes brought by room service to say happy birthday, turn down service which not only sorted beds and left chocolates but also changed mugs and towels for clean ones - we felt very spoilt. Concierge service was brilliant - got us taxis within 5 minutes. Breakfast a real treat too and service was great. All in all worth every penny and would go back but would like to stay for longer!
",5,2013,08,10
115,Excellent - all you could want,"Stayed just the one night in August.We had tickets for the Pompeii exhibit in the British museum. We arrived about lunchtime hoping they could look after our luggage as we though it too early to book in. However, after a very nice welcome, we were told we could go straight to our room which was fantastic after a hot train /tube journey.
good location for British museum and tube.
Very cool room, great bed and all very clean.
Staff excellent, got us taxis and looked after luggage in the morning.
We didn't eat at the hotel but the bar was very nice.
Would recommend and definitely stay again.",4,2013,08,09
115,"Fantastic, highly recommend!","We stayed here for our first wedding anniversary. The hotel made it so special by upgrading us to a fantastic suite, we couldn't have asked for more. But the hotel gave us more! We also received a bottle of prosecco.

This was a fantastic experience from start to finish. Friendly and helpful staff, offering towels to refresh your hands on arrival and bottles of water as you leave. Fresh lemonade and ice tea in the lobby. Concierge giving advice and making bookings.  Cooked breakfast to order as well as a big selection of continental goodies.

The hotel is in a fantastic location, close to the tube, Oxford street, the theatre district and covent garden.

We can't wait to go back!",5,2013,08,06
115,Best London hotel experience!,"We spent 4 nights at this hotel in early August and I must say that it made our trip! It is an expensive hotel (as are most hotels in London) but the location is amazing...a 2 min walk from the tube station, 5 minutes to Covent Garden, soho and Oxford street shopping. 

I cannot say enough about the staff. They were incredibly friendly and helpful. From the moment we checked in to when we left...reception, concierge, breakfast staff were all amazing. A special mention to Mohamed Zain who helped us start our trip on a high note....treated us to champagne and fruit in our fabulous room to celebrate a special occasion. Thank you Zain! 

The room was beautiful and spotless!  Not massive but still large for London standards and plenty of space. The bathroom was nice and large as well. The bed was possibly one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've slept in. 

All in all, it was amazing. Thank you to everyone at the hotel who made our experience so enjoyable.",5,2013,08,05
115,"Good location, well appointed.","Lovely, classic hotel in a great location in Soho.

1. Rooms
Small but comfortable room. Lots of storage.
Thoughtful tea, coffee, hot cocoa biscuit offering in the cupboard.

2. Service
Friendly staff.
Housekeeping seemed to make the rounds (a) early) and (b) often. Not sure why...
Juices, coffee/tea service in the lobby

3. Electronics
If you are American, be sure to get instructions on how to operate lights, hair dryers, anything that needs to be plugged in before you head up to your room. Not intuitive and pretty frustrating.

4. Gym
Gym in the basement was just ok. Needs A/V attention.",3,2013,08,05
115,Amazing!,Booked this hotel for my parents birthday and the hotel were amazing. My parents were greeted with a bottle of Prosecco. Their room was beautiful and the had a lovely view! They also said the staff were very polite and were very helpful. They said they would definitely stay there again. And they said the bed and pillows were heavenly.,5,2013,08,05
115,Fantastic!,"Beautiful hotel in an excellent location which is tastefully decorated and has been recently refurbished. The spotless room and bathroom were quite small but it had everything you need for an enjoyable stay. Beds and bedding were comfortable, there were dressing gowns and slippers, the air con was very quiet and tea/coffee making facilities were fine. A freshly cooked, full English breakfast was served by very attentive staff and the fresh juice, toast and tea were plentiful. There was iced tea and lemonade in the lobby and we were offered bottled water on our departure. Would definitely stay again.",5,2013,08,04
115,Very good,"Just stayed one night at the Bloomsbury Hotel with my boyfriend to treat ourselves and we were not disappointed! Our expectations from a hotel of this caliber were all met. 
Pros:
Location - very close to tube station, bars, restaurants, shopping
Staff - all very professional, friendly and helpful
Room - large and spacious (we had Deluxe room), air conditioning worked well, nespresso machine in the room
Breakfast - good range of food and plenty of hot and cold options.
Cons:
Personally we found the bed a bit too soft - this is the only reason I marked it down (I would have given it 4.5 out of 5 if I could have)
Overall a lovely stay, would definitely go back again and would recommend!",4,2013,08,04
115,Lovely hotel in great location,"I stayed in the hotel for 4 nights in July.  Hotel and room was very clean, comfortable and conveniently located.  The rooms were all well equipped, the bed was very comfortable. Plenty of space for myself, TV worked perfectly, room service was very good and had a fast turnaround time. The staff was very attentive and helpful when needed. I would highly recommend this hotel and would return myself when possible. The only thing I would do differently if i stayed there again is pass on the breakfast.  For the choices given it seemed a bit pricey in my opinion.",5,2013,07,31
115,Great staff & good location.,"Lovely hotel in a good location – it’s a good 5 minute walk away from Covent Garden. Food and drinks in the hotel are pricey but it’s London so I’m not surprised. We had a basic superior room, & no it isn’t huge but it is definitely big enough – we only paid £130 a night for our room and I think it was great value for money. All of the staff were very friendly & the lemonade/ ice team and bottles of water in reception are a nice touch. I will be staying again.",4,2013,07,30
115,great staff and  amazing hotel,"My girlfriend and I stopped in London for a few nights before heading to see my family in Ireland. I first want to express how well the hotel's location was. The hotel was convenient to all the historic tourist spots in London, restaurants and pubs. Also the hotel is very close to the underground train station. The ambiance of the hotel was spectacular. The staff was knowledgeable, very friendly and professional. I can not say enough about the staff from housekeeping to the front desk to the management. Mr.Mcgrath was a very genuine man, Brian the concierge was very friendly, helpful and just a class act. The general manager made our stay very pleasant and a time we would never forget. Hope to go back and visit this wonderful hotel and extraordinary staff. I would just like to thank the hotel for our great memories. Thank you very much Brian Joyce",5,2013,07,29
115,Professional polite and helpful staff - excellent location,We had a weekend away at this hotel in July.  We were greeted at the door with a smile. Cannot fault the professionalism friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff nothing was too much trouble.  Our room was excellent fully equipped to meet our needs extremely comfortable made for a very relaxing weekend away.  The bar in the lower ground floor is very cosy and there is a lovely atmosphere as you walk in.  The bar staff are very friendly nothing is too much trouble. The breakfast menu caters for everyone I dont think there was anylthing missing from the menu and again the staff were very attentive and made sure you had everything you needed.  The Restaurant menu is very impressive and the the food is excellent.  You are made to feel very welcome at this hotel.  The hotel is centrally located and the staff will advise you on places to go and things to see if you ask them.  Would definitely recommend to friends and family and stay here again.,5,2013,07,29
115,Great Location and Service,"We stayed for at the hotel as a Birthday treat and cannot fault location for theatre land and the west end.  Staff service in the hotel was a joy with every member of staff being polite and service very efficient.

We stayed in a suite room which was very large and impressively furnished.

Rooms are quite, air con is excellent and beds very comfortable.

Breakfast cooked to order and buffet attractive and varied.

A good choice for a theatre night or shopping weekend!",5,2013,07,29
115,Best Hotel Yet,"Our daughter booked this hotel for us as she had previously stayed there. The service was excellent from start to finish, nothing was too much trouble for them. The room was very comfortable and clean.  We also dined there in the evening and this meal was excellent, the breakfast was also very good. The hotel is very well located for both the theatre and the shops. We  normally try a different hotel each time we visit London but for our next visit we will definitely stay at the Bloomsbury again. It's the little touches that make a difference; we arrived when it was extremely hot weather so we were not prepared for rain. When we were leaving for the theatre we were told it was going to rain but in the wardrobe there was an umbrella and were we glad of it when we came out of the theatre. They also provided us with bottles of water for the journey home.",5,2013,07,29
115,Good place to stay - Centrally located London hotel,"We chose this hotel for a long weekend in May and were quite happy with our experience. It was exactly what we wanted for that specific weekend in London: a comfortable base in the buzzing city centre.

The hotel has been nicely renovated, service is good. However, we thought our room, which was located on the top floor, was extremely small (room also had quite a low ceiling which didn't help). The bathroom was well equipped but then again very small.

There is certainly nothing wrong with this hotel and many people might like it. So, would we stay here again? Perhaps if we just need a comfortable, stylish and centrally located place to stay. However, if we would like to have a real ""weekend away"" experience, we would probably chose for something else.",3,2013,07,26
115,Well located and very pleasant,"We had two very pleasant nights at the Bloomsbury Hotel. 

We arrived on a very hot afternoon so the ice tea was welcome as we're the hand towels.

Our room was adequate without being special. The bed was very comfortable. 

It has a very nice gym in the basement.

The lower ground floor bar was excellent and the lobby is excellent for a drink or just to relax.

All the staff were very cheerful and helpful.

The hotel is conveniently  located  a few hundred metres from Soho on one side and the British Museum on the other. The Tottenham Court Road Tube station is just around the corner.

115,First Class Hotel,"I stayed in this hotel for a business trip, it was a first class hotel from start to finish.
On arrival the staff were professional, helpful polite and made me feel very welcome. I cannot recommend enough.
Dined in the restaurant, food was very impressive too. 
Even as I left the manager took time to ensure I enjoyed my stay, I will definatley stay here again.",5,2013,07,25
115,"Good hotel, but quite expensive","This hotel is very centrally located only a few steps away from British Museum and Oxford Street. It's the perfect place to stay if you go to London for a short break and don't wanna spent to much time travelling with public transport. If you stay here you can use your legs instead.
Some of the rooms are extremely small, and whatever you buy at this hotel it will cost you a fortune. Spend your money on some of the restaurants in the area instead.",4,2013,07,25
115,As always top quality in every possible way,"We have stayed in this Hotel on several occasions and it had always been of the highest standard. The staff and management are helpful, friendly and polite. Can't recommend highly enough. We have always been impressed  with every aspect of our stay in the hotel and have been made to feel comfortable and very welcome ",5,2013,07,24
115,Nice hotel great location,"We stayed here as a family for one night. The hotel is very nice and our room was comfortable. The location was great and the terrace out side was nice as we had nice weather.
The only down side was we had to take 2 rooms as we were 2 adults and 2 children and at £280 + tax per room it turned into a very expensive weekend.
If they had some family rooms we would stay again.",4,2013,07,24
115,Birthday delight!,"We just spent five nights (July 10-15) at the charming Bloomsbury Hotel.After two nights in the hotel, we ran into the hotel project manager, Mr. Roderick McGrath, who asked how things were going. Since he asked, we explained that we were in a room that was near housekeeping, making it more than a little noisy at odd times. He immediately offered to move us to another
room, and we packed up and left for the day. On the way out we mentioned this to the desk and said that we appreciated the gesture since we were there for a special birthday. In the evening, when we returned, our bags had been moved to a large suite and a big birthday cake had been placed on a table, along with a bottle of Moet & Chandon on ice and a birthday card signed by the staff. It's true that we'd been placed in a room that was noisy. I gather some people complain and others don't. We were on the fence about it. But the response was exceptionally gracious and made our stay unforgettable. Much thanks to Mr. McGrath and his staff.

The Bloomsbury is on a quiet street near the British Museum and deceptively close to Charing Cross Road (2 minutes away) and the West End theaters (a 15-minute walk). The hotel website recommends using the Holborn tube stop, a short distance from the hotel, but in fact the incredibly convenient Tottenham Court Road station is only a 100 yards or so away, if that. That area's a little busier and a lot less quaint. Rooms are small, tho not by London standards, and well appointed. Good value for London. Depending on the time of day, coffee and tea or
lemonade and iced tea, or water to take away, are available in the ample lobby. The rooms and all the common areas are very clean. The breakfast buffet, which is optional, is lovely, and is served in a very nice room. Staff is very attentive and responsive to problems, as illustrated by our experience.

We will return.  There is no question of that.",5,2013,07,23
115,Bloomsbury in July,"We were booked into the Bloomsbury by our children for an anniversary a few years ago.  We love it and always stay there now when in London. Just stayed again for the Ashes Cricket at Lords.   The rooms are good, comfortable, great beds, sheets etc - and my wife says that when you walk in the lobby it smells lovely, actually I'd noticed that too.   Staff are always pleasant, helpful and well trained. Location, between Tottenham Court Road and the British Museum is really good, close to West End, Covent Garden and so on.  Bit expensive but this is a lovely hotel in the middle of London.  It was 32C today, quite warm for London, and the air conditioning works excellently.",5,2013,07,22
115,"Beautiful Hotel, great staff","We arrived on a very hot day and the welcome was fantastic, moist towels, ice tea and lemon available in reception.  The room was decent, with quality products and nice touches like a Nespresso machine for coffee, ipod docking station and free wifi.
The restaurant and bar is on the lower ground floor which is dark and gloomy with the shutters closed, which would not be my choice to sit in especially on a beautiful day.
The reception area is luxurious and welcoming at the same time, floating scented candles create of lovely atmosphere.  All the staff were charming, even if they did struggle a bit with a Yorkshire accent.
It is not a cheap budget hotel but I would judge it to be good value for money (just!).",4,2013,07,22
115,Couldn't fault it.,"This was a short business trip - a quick overnight stop in London. I didn't stay for dinner, nor even have a drink in the bar! From what I did experience though, I couldn't find any faults and I really enjoyed my stay.
The service was attentive and friendly without being overbearing which sometimes makes me feel uncomfortable in higher-end establishments.
My room was tidy, clean, modern and had a fabulously comfortable bed. The bathroom was neat and modern. The air conditioning worked as it should which was definitely a neccessity in the 30 degree London heat. The was no street noise despite only being on the second floor.
The whole place had a feel of subtle, relaxed and understated elegance which really is a refreshing change in London and other big cities these days.
I stayed for breakfast before departing and ordered the eggs benedict which was served reasonably swiftly and was cooked just as I enjoy it.
I would definitely visit again and would also consider spending a leisure break there. Very nice all round!",5,2013,07,21
115,Perfect!,"I am not a world traveler; I'm such an intimidated novice.  I recently traveled to Oxford and later London.  My stay at The Bloomsbury (July 12 - 15) provided me with confidence, comfort, great food, and the desire to return to England, and while in London, book another stay at The Bloomsbury.  Specifically, I was impressed with employees and their willingness to accommodate my sister and me with whatever question or need. In close proximity to the British Museum & Trafalgar Square, Bloomsbury provides a perfect base from which to plan excursions and exploration.  I so thankful that my experience was genuinely without complaints.",5,2013,07,20
115,Hotel staff and location made up for the problems,"My husband and I recently stayed here for a week-long trip to London. When we first showed up we were jet-lagged and exhausted, and they put us in a superior room so small we barely had room for our bags. To give it perspective, the room only had a single double bed in it - and it definitely wouldn't have fit a king and probably not even a queen. Having stayed here before and knowing all the rooms aren't like this, my husband spoke to the front desk about his concern since I was planning on working from the room for the week. Additionally the bed was SUPER uncomfortable and being more than 6 months pregnant I was worried after the first night about how we were going to spend a week there. 

The front staff was amazing and helped us move immediately to a deluxe room the next day. The room they moved us into had a lot more space, with a king size bed and was a much more comfortable room. The staff at the property were great all week and did a good job of making sure everything we needed was taken care of. You couldn't ask for a better location - it's so central and right in the middle of everything. I would stay here again and would recommend it to a friend, but just make sure you don't book a superior room as it's not worth the price.",4,2013,07,18
115,Birthday Trip,"Just back from a wonderful nights stay in this hotel. The staff were very attentive and couldn't have done more for us, in particular Dan who was working on reception when we checked in. All the staff genuinely seemed pleased to be at work.",5,2013,07,16
115,lovely stay,"I recently stayed at this hotel
July2-8
The hotel is a small well run.Very professional staff and pleasant
They go out of there way to be helpful
The lobby is elegant and classy
The morning breakfast was perfection
I liked staying in this area as it was not as touristy as the other larger hotels
Yet it was close to everything
We discovered a street that was full of really good restaurants not touristy
We enjoyed Hotel Charlotte lounge and restaurant
Roka is very good asian and fun! Had gone to there sister restaurant in Scottsdale and had a great dinner 
was surprised when I saw it in London
There is a veru good Gelato restaurant off that main street
What I liked about this street is it wasnt crowded like the more tourist areas
We enjoyed Tea at Harrods
Fortnum and Mason Tea and shopping
Hampton Court was a lovely day trip very easy to get to on train
We traveled on the tube everywhere felt very safe
The British Museum is close by 
I recommend this hotel and hope you found this helpful",5,2013,07,15
115,Will use again!,"We chose this hotel as we were having an all day meeting followed by entertaining some clients in a restaurant in the theatre district, so the location was perfect having also noted some great bars there too!
The staff were attentive from the moment we arrived, giving you the feeling that we were expected; 'welcome! Let me show you to your conference room, don't worry about checking in at reception, we'll bring the keys to you' - wow!   
And we didn't need to ask for anything it was all there or suggested; 'what time would you like your lunch, or shall we simply bring it to your conference room' - these guys are good.
And although being bang in the centre of London, this place seems to be a quiet little oasis; I got sleep!
Thoroughly recommended!",5,2013,07,15
115,"Good hotel, great service",Bloomsbury Hotel is a very nice hotel located in an excellent location -- British Museum is only about 3 blocks away and it's right by Oxford Street and near Soho.  The rooms are small but that's typical for London.  I found the staff to be outstanding.  They went out of their way to be helpful. I would definitely stay there again.,4,2013,07,14
115,"Tasteful decor , great location","Very nice hotel. Stayed in a superior room which was an ok size but nicely fitted out. Location is 30secs from totter ham court tube, 5 mins to Covent garden and 10 mins to Leicester sq and Soho. Bathrooms are typical for London ie v small",4,2013,07,14
115,Very nice & perfect location,"Stayed here last night for our weekend away in London.  Friendly staff and good, clean hotel.  Perfectly located for the West End, Chinatown, Soho, Covent Garden etc......all within walking distance.

I would stay here again and wouldn't hesitate in recommending it to others.",4,2013,07,14
115,Ok but not five star,"We stayed here while attending a work event, in a deluxe room.  The decor and furnishings are very tasteful, and our (deluxe) room was a reasonable size, with two comfortable chairs in addition to the usual bed / desk / TV etc.  We also had two windows, which was nice.  See my photos for a better idea of the room.  The bathroom was small but nicely decorated, and looked better than a standard chain hotel bathroom.  

My complaints with this hotel were threefold: 

1) The coffee maker was dirty!  We had to scrub the coffee maker before it was usable, which really isn't acceptable in a five star hotel.  I'm not particularly fussy, but the water intake for this was absolutely filthy.
2) Yet again, I didn't get the perks I'm supposed to with my frequent flyer programme, despite presenting my membership card etc etc.  In fairness this is a recurrent theme with GHA group hotels, and not unique to this one.  It's disappointing in a five star hotel.
3) Breakfast service was very slow - not a disaster, but again not what one would expect in a five star hotel.  From the breakfast experience I certainly wouldn't rush to dine in the hotel restaurant in the evening!

The staff we interacted with were reasonably friendly and seemed quite efficient, but the experience somehow lacked the finesse of other five star hotels in London and elsewhere around the world.  

This hotel is certainly more than adequate as a bed for the night, but it lacks the attention to detail I'd expect in a five star hotel.  Unfortunately I won't be returning.",3,2013,07,13
115,"Very good hotel, but standard rooms really small","Bloomsbury Hotel is a very nice hotel, located in the centre of London, close to Covent Garden and Oxford Street. Very impressive lobby and convenient and big check-in area create very good first impression. I stayed in a standard room, which was nicely decorated and comfortable but it was very small. The website is clear, it is a room ideally for a single traveller or for a couple not bothered with the lack of space. Service is very attentive, comfort of sleep very good and access to the tube and other key areas of town very easy. I would definitely recommend it for a quick visit in London!",4,2013,07,12
115,Nice Hotel but smallish room,"We recently stayed at this hotel for three nights so that we could spend time in London before taking a cruise.  The hotel was very nice, the furnishings were very tasteful, the bathroom was well-appointed and everything was very clean.  The only problem that we commented on was that the room was too small for us to be there comfortably.  There was one place to put one piece of luggage, but that was all.  There was very little floor space to maneuver around the room.  Even though I liked the appointments of room, I probably would not stay here again because of the room size.  While costs are high in London for a nice hotel room, I did think that the cost for this particular room was a bit high for what we got.  The concierge staff and the front desk staff were very nice and helpful. Unfortunately, the mattress had an issue too - both sides rolled to the middle - I hate that.  When we complained, we were told that there were no more rooms in our price category but they would place a board under to mattress to see if that would help.  It didn't.",4,2013,07,12
115,Love love love the Bloomsbury Hotel,"Wouldn't stay anywhere else in London.. The staff are very helpful and go out of there way to make your stay pleasant :) the hotel is immaculate and has any facility you could expect from a hotel, even a chapel and library are based within this hotel.. The location is great.. If you're going for a central trip.. As its based just off Oxford street.. Near Tottenham court road station.. Would strongly reccomend this hotel :)",5,2013,07,12
115,2013 Update on my previous review and experience,"This June I used the hotel as a ""guest"" accommodation for two close friends who were in London for four days and it went beautifully (as I expected).  In addition, the concierge staff and overall staff/management went out of their way to make my guests have an exceptional experience - I just received a thank you note from them which indicated that everything was not only as promised, but with added personal touches (for instance, not only were the daily fruit baskets and wine provided as promised, but each day was a different combination of fresh fruits and varietal wines...and finished on the birthday of one, with champagne and personal notes). In addition, as I knew would be the case, the concierge staff helped arrange special tickets and tours, and all in all made the stay spectacular.  I can't recommend highly enough.",5,2013,07,11
115,OK Hotel,"For central London this wasn't too bad a hotel but the size of the room was very disappointing.  Not even enough floor space to put down 1 suitcase, let alone 2, and no drawers to unpack for the few nights we were there, hence the need to be in/out of the cases.  We finally squeezed one on the floor behind the room door, consequently putting up with only being able to partially open the door for entry/exit.
The quality of the mattress wasn't the best.  It would sag when sitting on the edge of the bed.  There was just enough room for 2 people to get around the bed.  
We did check with the front desk on this problem and they stated that this was their standard classic room.  Unless you upgraded (larger in size? more $), the rooms are cramped.
Location of the hotel was great for walking to places, getting the underground tube, etc.",3,2013,07,11
115,Bad experience,"I have been to the hotel a few times without a problem with the exception of my third time when I dealt with a French receptionist called Louise. She clearly has problems with Americans. She was rude and inconsiderate of others' feelings. I went downstrairs to check out. The first thing she asked me was ""where are you from?"" I said the United States, she said something in French I did not know. Then she asked me about my last name origin, I said I was half Italian.

Anyway, she asked me if any bags were in the room and I said yes. She asked me if I needed help bringing them down, I said yes please. Then she rudely said "" you dont expect me to go bring them down for you"" I said no ma'am ! You asked me if I needed help and I said yes but I did not imply that whatsoever.

I let it go. I asked her if I could get  receipt to prove to my employer that I paid the hotel fees to get reimbursed, then she blew the strongest air on my face and said "" I give to you that before"" cute grammar but rude response. I explained to her that there might be some miscommunication and that I did not get a receipt. I apologized to her and asked her politely to print out another receipt. She responded in French and threw the receipt on the table.

I felt pretty humiliated. Here I was trying to be the nicest that I could  to get something that I think I am entitled to, a receipt!  I asked the doormen to connect me with the manager so I spoke with a guy named Mikel Alvarez who did not show much care about the incident.

Will I come back? No! I paid 2200 pounds for 5 days only. I think I can get a much better experience with that price. This happened on July 2013.

Best of luck",1,2013,07,08
115,Great for business,"I can't fault this hotel on anything - I stayed the night and hosted a meeting in one of their conference rooms and absolutely everything was perfectly organised.

We used what was probably the smallest meeting room (three of us in the meeting) and the room seemed to have been pre-prepared to exactly how we would need it. The plasma screen on the wall was ideal and a member of staff was quickly on hand to explain to us technophobes how to connect to it.

Great staff, great food, great facilities - it's not often I'm that impressed and hence why I've registered on TripAdvisoor specifically to leave this review!",5,2013,07,06
115,amazing anniversary stay,"Thankyou to the staff and management at the bloomsbury hotel for making our first year anniversary stay a special one!we had a one night stop over on the 26th june, and it was perfect!  A beautiful luxury hotel, in a central location and very kind and helpful staff throughout our stay! the extra touches you provided for us made the trip even more special! Thankyou we cant wait to come again! :)",5,2013,07,03
115,Great Location and Staff that made me feel truly welcome,"From the front desk, to the doorman, to staff whom I encountered in the halls, every person to a fault greeted me and was immediately willing to help with whatever I was asking about.  I booked at the last minute due to a problem with previously arranged lodgings, and had a standard room for two nights.  The room was not large, but beautifully appointed and lovely.  Everything was thought of down to the last detail and the room was silent.  (room 619).  I heard voices in the hall passing once - that was it!  No outside trucks, traffic or voices.  It was amazing.  It was the warmest day of the year so far and the AC was instantly responsive.  Lovely amenities, iPod dock, robes and slippers, tea and cookies (or a french press for coffee).  Most delicious smelling toiletries - the whole hotel smelled great!  In the lobby there was always a pitcher of iced tea or lemonade when we came in from a warm day of sightseeing.  The bed was very comfortable and my one small complaint is that it is made in a way that the sheets and duvet only reach mid chest - please make the beds so these can come up to my neck!  Needless to say, that is about all I could find that wasn't near perfect.  I will definitely choose this hotel on future trips - did I mention that there are 3 tube stops within a 5 minute walk - one a block away?  I stopped in the British Museum randomly 3 or 4 times, because it is so close.  I can't say enough good things about the hotel.  Did not dine at the hotel, so will defer to others on the restaurant and room service, but I did eat the chocolates left on the pillow every night!

Final great thank you - we had to leave our apartment at 11am on a Sunday morning, when we arrived the hotel had a room ready for us.  I know they can't promise this, but it was so appreciated after a bad experience with our previous lodgings.",5,2013,07,02
115,"Perfect location, understated luxury","We stayed here for our honeymoon right after Christmas in 2012 into January 2013.  We were very impressed by the service and cleanliness of the hotel.  Overall, the hotel provides an understated luxury that makes it extremely comfortable while also feeling elegant.  The hotel is in a truly unbeatable location--we walked to nearly everything in the city with ease.  It is also very close to the Tottenham Court tube station and also to many bus stops that will take you throughout the city very conveniently.  The staff was very helpful and friendly, and we felt like valued guests through our entire stay.  This hotel is really a gem, we have recommended it repeatedly to friends and family traveling to London and we will be back on our next trip!",5,2013,07,01
115,Great location and enjoyable stay,"Stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel. This is a few mins walk from Tottingham Court Road Tube, and very close to the Dominion Theatre (We will rock you). From here it is very easy to get onto Oxford Street on foot.

Room was a superior room on 8th floor (804),  clean and comfortable. Only minor downsides were (1) Loose grout on bathroom floor which nipped and cut wife's foot, (2) No windows in room, only skylights, so i;'d not recommend 804 if you stay here.

Other than that, would go back and stay there again, staff friendly and helpful",4,2013,07,01
115,Great spot and high standard,"What a near perfect position for theatre land and Covent Garden. Breakfast was excellent and the concierge Brian got what we needed when it looked unlikely. Standard room a bit small (as usual in London) but well maintained.

It's not cheap but by London standards not that expensive, well above average.",4,2013,06,30
115,One if my all time favourite stays to the Bloomsbury Hotel.,"This is by far my favourite hotel in the capital for both business and pleasure; superb location on a quiet street seconds from the bustle of Oxford street, splendid decor and staff who really go the extra mile to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing. This is a four star hotel which far outperforms its rating. 

I was greeted by one of the porters wearing a bowler hat opening the cab door... he swiftly took my luggage up the steps and into the foyer. At check in I was greeted by Mikel and Gunilla, always good to see familiar faces after a long journey and on this occasion I was lucky enough to be upgraded to a junior suite. 

The suite was really comfortable and  the decor superb; spacious, plush carpet and furnishings, with coffee machine and roll-top bath with plazma screen in the bathroom. The complementary water and Times newspaper are always very welcome. If you are planning a special weekend in London or are lucky enough to have the corporate allowance to book a junior Suite the Bloomsbury is a real gem in the capital.

Breakfast is always one of the highlights at the Bloomsbury. Estralita is always very welcoming and it's a pleasure to see her and she always remembers how I like things... Usually my Eggs Benedict! These are a highlight on the Bloomsbury menu.

I cannot recommend the team at the Bloomsbury more highly - a four star hotel with five star service!
Mr Roughton

",5,2013,06,30
115,Lovely stay,"My husband and I stayed here for one night after trip to the theatre.  Absolutely lovely hotel, bedroom spacious and very clean.  Staff very helpful and polite.  The hotel is very central with Oxford Street just around the corner and a ten minute walk to Queens Theatre.  Lots of little things making it a really enjoyable stay such as the complimentary bottled water, tea, coffee, hot chocolate and biscuits.  Came back from the theatre to find the bed turned down and a chocolate on the pillow! Bed very comfortable with lovely crisp white linen.  Breakfast was very tasty with lots to choose from and many offers from staff to replenish toast, coffee etc. Would definitely recommend and will stay here again.",5,2013,06,29
115,Excellent stay,"Stayed here for one night on business and thought the hotel just lovely.  The room was perfect, and had everything you need for a very comfortable stay including a lovely coffee machine and fab toiletries.  Being a woman on my own I didn't venture far but the location is just perfect.  A few minutes walk to the tube and theatres.  Bathrobes and slippers are provided so I was quite happy staying in the room chilling out watching TV on a very comfortable bed.  I had to turn down the heating on arrival as the air con was set to 28 degrees!  I like the heat but it was a bit warm.
Planning on going back with my husband for a few days in the near future.",5,2013,06,27
115,Wonderful staff and great suite!,"We had a corner suite, were treated like royalty and the rooms are beautiful, with a huge bathroom, including a luxurious claw-footed tub. The staff and breakfast is excellent. Just two blocks from the metro, which we loved! We particularly liked Roddy, who sent us a complementary bottle of champagne. I left some things in the room by accident and they were nice enough to send them back to me in America. One item was a camera! Imagine that! A French hotel would find your request amusing and ignore it.
My only small gripe, which is not their fault, is the bed does not have top sheets. You are either  covered in a down-filled duvet and too warm, or bare. This is apparently how most hotels do it in England and France.",5,2013,06,26
115,Perfect.,"My wife and I have just had a wonderful stay (one night) at the Bloomsbury Hotel in Great Russell Street. This was a return visit for us and no doubt we will treat ourselves again. It is a beautiful hotel in a great location. Very tasteful rooms, immaculately kept - and charming, friendly staff. Just perfect.",5,2013,06,24
115,Great Stay,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is located in a great spot.  It is out of the hustle and bustle of the city but close by to the tube, the train station is nearby.  Even Trafalgar Square is not that far if you don't mind walking and exploring the city.

The staff is extremely friendly and helpful to a person being in England for the first time.  The concierge was extremely helpful especially.

The hotel is going more green (environmentally helpful) with the room lights and AC.  Once I discovered the trick by asking, it makes a lot of sense.  I applaud their efforts.

I will stay here again when I return to London to see what I did not see this time.",5,2013,06,23
115,Great Hotel in fantastic location,"Stayed here for a night post theatre and had a suite as a treat with the family. Great room lots of space but the girls loved the bathroom with large roll top bath where the could luxuriate in front of a TV built into the wall in front of the bath. I loved the great shower with the big square shower head above you which was like a great warm rain storm fab.

Breakfast was fantastic a brilliant continental breakfast as good as any I have eaten in Germany. The girls including the wife had the fresh prepared crepes and waffles with clotted cream and berrys I am assured were excellent.

No parking at the hotel but checked with the secure underground car park in Bloomsbury Square 3 minute walk to the hotel and got 24 hr parking for £15.

Terrific experience great service  fab stay just wish it could have been longer",5,2013,06,22
115,Lovely stay,"We spent three nights at the Bloomsbury and found it to be a charming hotel conveniently located to central London and the Tottenham Court underground. The concierge and front desk staff do their best to be helpful, but we were surprised that they had few dining suggestions. Trip Advisor was far more helpful when choosing a restaurant. We did not opt for the rather expensive breakfast served at the hotel, since the cafe two doors to the left of the hotel offered an excellent breakfast for less than 5 pounds. (The porridge and freshly squeezed orange juice were excllent!) Still, we can recommend the Bloomsbury as a moderately priced hotel in the heart of pricey London.",5,2013,06,22
115,Excellent for business and pleasure,"My company booked a room here for a key customer meeting and the general opinion from all of us is that we have now found a venue we will use repeatedly. Guests came from all over the UK and all found the venue easy to get to. The meeting room was well set out and catered for with a great lunch covering all dietary requirements but being very original in choices. The staff are all exceptionally friendly and helpful.
Room I had was a little on the small side but in London who wants to spend too much time in the hotel room. The room was well decorated and comfortabel though and the excellent air conditioning was a blessing.
Ideally located for sightseeing London as well.
So for business or pleasure, if you budget allows I would fully recommend the Bloomsbury.
It even conveniently has an NCP car park directly across the road, yet another blessing when, as I did, driving into London.
We are already planning our next meeting there.",5,2013,06,21
115,Nice stay in a great location,"Was only one night in London, for a business dinner, I booked the Bloomsbury due to other positive reviews here and the central location. I had to be in the N.W. for dinner the evening I arrived and the city for meetings the next morning but also wanted to do a bit of shopping in covent garden. For all of that this hotel is perfectly placed. 
One thing your really do notiice here is the polite enthusiasm of all the staff. The doorman was top class and everybody else I met very friendly and helpful. 
The room is what you might expect at the rate. Nicely furnished with comfortable double bed, a good work desk with ipod dock and a good sized TV on the wall. Bathroom was also nice and clean and the shower OK. I would probably pay a bit of a premium next time to have a room with a window facing the outside rather than another wall but I picked this up as a last available so cannot make a fuss about that. The only complaint was the ineffectiveness of the aircon, it was a very warm night and although I set it for a low temp the room was remained too warm for my liking.  
Certainly I would stay there again. This time due to my agenda I did not get to try the restaurant or bar so something additional to do on the next trip.",4,2013,06,20
115,Not improving,"Since my last experience at this hotel I've decided to give it a try this week as I was over in London again. Conclusion not better than before. Arrived in the room quite late in the night and it was impossible to turn off the TV! The remote was not working and the main switch was blocked. Had to call House keeping service that had to remove the TV from the fram and unplug the power cord. I definitely have problems with my room each time that i come to this hotel.

The good point: Staff is quite friendly and the lobby of the hotel is very cozy, the location of the hotel couldn't be better.",3,2013,06,20
115,The PERFECT place to stay in London!,"This hotel is in a fabulous location in walking distance from major museums as well as the theater district with its many good to wonderful restaurants. The suite was Impeccably clean, large and beautifully decorated. The hotel staff was extremely courteous and accommodating. The concierge was able to obtain very good tickets to a sold out show for us. They went out of their way to help our daughter surprise us for a milestone anniversary by placing her gifts sent from the States in our room prior to our arrival. Don't look any further, this is an excellent hotel in London.",5,2013,06,19
115,Great Place!,Stayed two nights here.  Very nice modern bathroom with air conditioning in the room even.  The staff is EXCELLENT.  Very friendly.  Made my first time in Europe a lovely experience.  Great bar downstairs too.  Really don't have anything negative to say about the place.,5,2013,06,17
115,A lovely place to stay,"We have now stayed here twice, and really I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in London.  Very friendly staff, who make you really feel welcome, comfortable rooms (not enormous, but this is London...) and a perfect location, with a car park a few steps away if you need it.  Look no further.  Only criticism was that the television didn't work, they attempted to fix it immediately, and apologised profusely.  In any case, we didn't stay there to watch television so no big deal.",5,2013,06,17
115,Afternoon Delight,"We went there on saturday for afternoon Tea in the Lutyens Lounge. Well what can I say. The tea was absolutely delicious, iin lovely traditional surroundings. Beautifully presented and extremely generous amount for two people. Would highly recommend this tea to anyone and would definitely return to the hotel, possibly for an overnight stay. Really lovely afternoon, thank you.",5,2013,06,16
115,"Great friendly service, nice rooms - will come again","We stayed for one night in The Bloomsbury Hotel. Despite our last-minute booking our request for a travel cot could be accomodated. Staff were extremly friendly and made us feel special. Our room was reasonably sized and very quiet. There was a vide variety for breakfast. The hotel is located near the British Museum and also near Tottenham Court Road tube station, so works well for both tourist and business trips.",5,2013,06,16
115,a lovely stay,"I booked the hotel using trip advisor as a guide, and we were not disappointed.  The hotel was centrally located so that we were in walking distance of the shops ( we did a lot of walking) but also only a short walk to the tube so it was easy to get to and from Heathrow airport.  The hotel itself was lovely, the room was small but the furnishings and the bed were plush.  We had a lovely breakfast.  The staff were very efficient and very helpful.  I would definately stay here again.",5,2013,06,16
115,Had a great time in Bloomsbury hotel,Hotel is in a very good location- it is very close to covent gardens and within 10 minutes walk to Leicester Suare and within 5 minutes walk to the tube station. Hotel is located in a quiet street and has all facilities needed for an enjoyable vacation or business. Wiifii is free of charge in all areas including the room. They have a fitness centre which I used and thought was very clean and well equiped. Staff is very friendly and very helpful. Only thing I found a little bit disturbing is that refreigerator was a bit noisy.... but I am very sensitive to noise. ,5,2013,06,16
115,Perfect weekend in a perfect location.,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay. The hotel was impressive from the moment we approached it. The staff were professional and helpful and the room more than met our expectations. Considering the central location it was extremely quiet and felt very private. It was very clean, and I'm fussy when it comes to hotel rooms, and had all the amenities you could ask for. I was especially impressed that our tea/coffee supplies were refreshed on our first day when we had only had the room for a few hours! Breakfast was very tasty and we were glad we added it to our stay. Basically, if we were to stay in the same area again this would be the first place we'd stay.",5,2013,06,14
115,Great location and,"A group of four friends stayed at the hotel in late may 2013. A very pleasant impression of the hotel - exactly what we wanted: great access to the British Museum, and shopping on Oxford Street. It is a great hotel, if slightly with an impersonal feel to it. The rooms were clean, quiet and if we needed anything, it was delivered within  few minutes.The service is smooth, the only suggestion would be for the concierge staff to be more knowledgeable about the available dining options in the area. We have actually had better luck finding restaurants using the Tripadvisor app on the Iphone.",4,2013,06,13
115,Girls roaming the corridors,"A hotel of the luxury brand 'Doyle Collection' in the heart of London, i.e. The Bloomsbury Hotel should be a treat in every way. The rooms are nice and clean (although mine was lacking in natural daylight), staff open doors when entering and leaving, scented candles are lit, well basically a wonderful experience.
However to my horror and amazement, I was woken up the second night of my stay by somebody knocking on my door late in the evening. A certain 'Eva' introduced herself by stating that she was here to provide me with 'entertainment' and 'passionate fun'!
I shut the door and called reception. The manager was taking this extremely lightly and didn't seem in the least surprised nor worried that this had happened.
In the meanwhile, Eva had made her way down to reception and told the manager she had made a mistake with the room number!
This even worried me more.

All I can recommend when booking a 450 pound suite here, is that you may get more service than you actually paid for! So just lock your door tightly at night!",1,2013,06,12
115,Tamara and Gabriels Bloomsbury Experience,"So glad I chose to stay in this lovely hotel. I brought my 8 year old son on a short theatre break and the staff were fantastic; even surprising him with a special hotel bear when they found out he was teddy mad! Our room was beautiful stylish and spotless and the aromatherapy toiletries were gorgeous. It was in a perfectly central location for us and we loved that the area of Bloomsbury was quiet a peaceful little oasis. I thought the hotel had great character, with very elegant architecture and lots of interesting literacy history. I recommend a visit to the old library. We decided to have dinner at the hotel and we both found the food exceptional. We also had an amazing breakfast with a wide selection of all wonderful things, the cooked breakfast was delicious. My son and I had a truly memorable trip to London and I cant thank the staff enough Thank you Janaina for taking such good care of us and for being so attentive and making it such a special time. Cant wait to come back :)",5,2013,06,11
115,Really nice hotel with a great location,We stayed over bank holiday weekend and so the room rate was quite high - similar to the rest of London. So if we based our stay on the normal rate this hotel is definitely value for money. Really nice comfortable clean rooms and a great location. Staff friendly and eager to help. Def stay here again :) ,5,2013,06,11
115,Wonderful hotel,"The atmosphere of the Bloomsbury is both sophisticated and cozy.  The staff was outstanding, especially the concierge service.   All of the staff was always helpful, pleasant and professional. We really enjoyed meals in the dining room and snacks and drinks in the bar.   We looked forward to tea in the lobby after a day of exploring London.  Our room was very comfortable.  I loved the ""extras"":  thick bath robes, slippers, tea, coffee, snacks, etc. The hotel location is so convenient.  We stayed 9 days, and we are looking forward to our next visit.",5,2013,06,11
115,Short weekend stay,"I stayed here with my partner on Saturday 8th June for 1 night to celebrate our Anniversary. The hotel was everything I expected, door service, lovely smell as you walk in and very friendly receptionist offering warm towels on arrival. The room was clean and smart, one of our room keys didn't work at one point which was a bit of a nuisance, but other than that we enjoyed our stay. Extra mention to the manager for the Prosecco in our room, much appreciated!!",4,2013,06,11
115,Did not live up to our expectations,"We primarily chose to stay at the Bloomsbury due to its Location, GHA Platinum membership and the many things it promises on its website. After spending a week on business in London, I extended to spend a tranquil and relaxing weekend here with my husband. Naturally that has its price but thats what i was willing to pay for. 

I sent feedback omments below to the Bloomsbury Hotel Mailbox during our stay and have yet to hear back.  Frankly, at other hotels, management is proactive and reacts.  Reading the reviews on TripAdvisor though, I see that they prefer to just write their comments on this forum.

The arrival was great, the upgraded room was wonderful.   The first night was sound. A nice start to a long-awaited luxury hotel stay.  But the next day, things started to go downhill.

What was supposed to be a culinary highlight during breakfast was a let down (order not properly taken, poached egg more like a hard boiled egg, staff's attitude poor towards feedback and the change of attitude towards us in general during the remaining service,  buttermilk pancakes had a pita bread like texture, etc).  The breakfast the next day was nothing to write home about.  Quite frankly, we expected much more quality.  I ordered the scrambled eggs with salmon and the presentation was not very appetizing.  The toast was charred black on the edges, but I was told that this is British style.

We arrived back from dinner and had a crowd of youths (that were from an event happening within the hotel premises) with alcohol and cigarettes in their hands, smoking at the entrance and blocking the way. We thought we had arrived at one of those pubs. What an uncomfortable situation this was while passing.   There is a sign at the steps, stating that smoking is not allowed in that area.  Well - the hotel staff did not care to enforce this.

There  was a party event downstairs  and the music beats could be heard from the 6th floor; we could not sleep.  The reception told us that they were helpless and stated that they cannot control their guests. However, the music would stop at midnight. It was past midnight and the music was still playing -  I assume the guests had taken control of the sound system.
Maybe out of courtesy it would have been nice to forewarn the other guests not associated to this event that there will be this noise and a little token of compensation.  However there was nothing.

The GHA platinum status seemed to be forgotten here.  We received no local amenity or note.  The newspaper was forgotten on our final day.  Very inconsistent service.

While we checked-out, I mentioned a few of these issues to the energetic front desk lady.  She said the event did not take place within the hotel and blamed it on some clubgoers in the area.  We did receive two cocktail vouchers for our missed amenity but this did not make up for the overall disappointment.

The major disappointment lies with the service presence and attitude, the quality of breakfast and the noise. I opted to stay here and receive the value for this pricy stay.I wanted to experience the warm and welcoming service as well as relaxation that ive encountered at GHA facilities worldwide. This hotel clearly misses the mark that the others have set.

Such a shame, great location and rooms but we will probably stay somewhere else next time we are in London.",3,2013,06,10
115,Amazing Concierge Service at The Bloomsbury!,"We spent 3 nights at the Bloomsbury and had a simply wonderful time! We hit London at EXACTLY the right time from a weather standpoint - it was in the 70’s with bright, bright sunny days. We stayed in a suite with free wifi, adapters for the US devices, tea and/or coffee, water and biscuits. These amenities are REALLY important to me as I wake up so early. Even our bathroom had a TV in it!  There is a fully equipped Fitness Center in the basement with everything you need for a great work out. 

The Concierge services headed by Mr. Brian Murphy are worthy a special mention. Brian and his staff literally can’t do enough for you. They are a fountain of information about transportation, must-see exhibits, plays, etc. They address you by name, which is pretty remarkable with the number of guests they have, are super cheerful and no query is too much trouble for them.

Finally the location of this hotel is ideal. You are walking distance from Tottenham Court Tube Station, the British Museum, Covent Garden and it’s great shopping, the West End Theaters, China Town, etc. 

We have been to the Bloomsbury numerous times and will definitely be back!

The Rapps",5,2013,06,10
115,Superb Hotel,"Just back from a 2 night stay. Can't praise the staff enough. Nothing too much trouble for them,
especially Zanic? the duty manager for making my Birthday so special. Will certainly be visiting
again. Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,06,10
115,Truly gracious staff,"Spent four nights at the Bloomsbury as we enjoyed London in spite of the chilly May weather.  We loved all the conveniences of the location and the room offerings.  Wifi worked great; adapters for U.S. devices were supplied in the room.  The coffee maker, the teapot, tea choices, cookies (perhaps I should say biscuits) were all top rate.  Room temp controls were wonderful.  It is very tight quarters, however, and the bed was a little soft and saggy for my tastes.  We loved discovering the pocket neighborhoods nearby.  Don't miss Monmouth Coffee if you're serious about fine coffee.  The staff at this hotel is absolutely superlative.",5,2013,06,08
115,Fabulous time in the Bloomsbury,"I and my sister stayed at the Bloomsbury hotel recently & we had such a wonderful time! We actually flew over from Dublin to see our grandparents but we really wanted to be in London for a night as we love it so much. The hotel staff were fabulous & the room was fabulous too! Great location for shopping & we went to see the ""We Will Rock You"" show ... simply amazing!

A big thank you to everyone at the Bloomsbury - the staff in reception couldn't have been nicer!

A special big thank you to the General Manager - Michael (and he knows why!)!!",5,2013,06,08
115,An Outstanding Hotel,"Perfectly located within walking distance of Oxford Street, Regents Park, Hyde Park, Green Park, and the Dominion Theatre, this hotel is a real gem.

With beautifully furnished rooms, very attentive staff and excellent service, this is a proper hotel providing everything a hotel should provide to guarantee a superb stay.

We'll definitely be back",5,2013,06,05
115,"Amazing, AMAZING hotel!","Just home from four fabulous nights in this amazing hotel! Cannot say enough about the staff, especially the concierge...haven't come across genuine customer service like that in a long time! The hotel is beautiful and so well located. You have to stay here! Will most definately be back!",5,2013,06,04
115,Cosy hotel tucked away from the hustle & bustle,"What a great find! We first stayed here in December 2012 for over a week and again in May of this year. The hotel is so close & convenient to Oxford Street it really is a hidden gem. At the end of the street you have Boots & Sainsburys for all your snacks and toiletries you left at home and in the other direction you have Tottenham Court road with stacks of eating choices, homewares stores, banks and loads more and then in the other direction you have Oxford Street where you will shop till you drop! The plus is that your hotel is close when you're feet just wont walk you any further! 

Positives:
Warm inviting lobby with fresh apples & beverages
Quiet location just minutes from Oxford Street
Nice modern furnishings
Comfy bed
Semi spacious rooms
Usable window in the room for fresh air
Super close to Tottenham Court Road tube
Super close to great restaurants in Soho - Princi, Busaba Thai, Tap Coffee for awesome lattes/flat whites

Negatives:
Old, slow elevators
Tiny bathroom with a door that is unable to be completely opened due to lack of space",5,2013,06,03
115,An excellent hotel in a great location!,The staff here are very helpful and attentive and nothing is too much trouble.  The rooms are well decorated and have everything you need.  There is a wide variety of foods at breakfast to suit everyone.  We walked to Oxford Street and theatre land as well as Trafalgar Square with the hotel being in such a great location.  The facilities are excellent too.,5,2013,06,02
115,An outstanding hotel in an excellent location,"This is one of the best hotels that we have ever stayed at. Our room was extremely comfortable and serviced twice daily.  All the staff were friendly, welcoming and extremely professional - in a warm way. The hotel facilities were excellent. We highly recommend this hotel. It was extremely well priced for its central London location.",5,2013,06,01
115,Great service!,"I chose this hotel for its location near the theatre, shops and all the major sites in London.  But I never expected it to be warm and welcoming because its more of a business hotel.  I was pleasantly surprised.  When you first walk in, the scent of the candles and décor just take your breath away.  The concierge service virtually walked me to the tube and helped me find my way around London, which can be very confusing at first.  They were so friendly, and they are the main reason why I'm writing this review.  The supermarket and cafes are just steps away, and the tube is around the corner. The rooms are small but very clean and modern. I loved this hotel and would definitely return.",5,2013,05,31
115,"Super location, top service!","The location was super if you wanted to do some shopping - just 5 - 7 mins walk from Oxford Street. Yet it was tucked away on a quiet street. Then the staff - ever willing to help. The rooms were so neat, the heater was flawless. 

I'll definitely come back, though I look forward to trying out the other hotels on the Doyle Collection stable!!!",5,2013,05,30
115,"Great hotel, great location","This hotel is located in the heart of London, very near the Totenham Court tube station and within a short walking distance to SoHo and the theater district.  Extremely convenient and located on a quiet side street.  The room was appropriated well and very clean.  The room was a little small, but not uncomfortable.  Excellent and friendly staff.  This was my and my partner's first trip to London and certainly not our last.  We will most definitely return to this wonderful hotel.",5,2013,05,29
115,Incredible experience,"This was my wife's first trip to London and I wanted to make sure I did it right, meaning finding a hotel that was decent, professional, clean and accommodating. The Bloomsbury exceeded my expectations. As soon as we arraived at the hotel, the doorman and staff ensured that we knew their names if case there was anything we needed, we just had to ask. The front desk staff were amazing and whisked us to the room within minutes, but more important, ensured we had everything we needed to get settled in. 
The room was excellent and my wife's expectation the washroom had to be spotless, really spotless and it was. The hotel apologized they wanted to put us in another room but could not do so until the next day even though there was absolutely nothing wrong with our room. The next day the asked us to view to other rooms and allowed us to pick. Royalty doesn't get any better services.

The concierge and staff helped us getting out tickets for the shows, day trips, cabs and anything else we needed promptly. The hotel's central location to all of London's sites and theatre district could not have worked out any better. I was so pleased I included breakfast in my room rate to ensure I wasn't roaming the streets in the morning looking for a decent breakfast. The buffet and menu lacked for nothing. There was no skimping on their food offering.

Overall, our experience was nothing short of fantastic and I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone. No pretension, just great service, right from the front desk right down to the hostess in the breakfast room.",5,2013,05,29
115,Return stay just as good as the first,This is a great hotel that has maintained a very high standard in all areas. Front staff in particular are just fantastic and I think the rates are quite reasonable for London. We were in London for four days and took in a West End show - 10 min walk to Jersey Boys at the Prince Edward Theatre. Very close to the British Museum also which we visited for a couple of exhibitions. Rooms are well serviced and maintained as well as being of a reasonable size. Bed was very comfortable and the bar and restaurant in the Hotel are recommended. Fitness Centre was very good as well.,5,2013,05,28
115,Perfect to visit the British Museum,"Excellent location 5 mins gentle stroll to the British Museum and 2 mins from Tottenham Court Road tube station. Stayed two nights whilst on business and my wife visited the Pompei exhibition. Given a room on the 8th floor which was nice and quiet and away from traffic noise, however with windows open the police and ambulance sirens are always heard! The room well equipped and spotlessly clean, nice touches included a nexpresso coffee machine, iPod dock, water and chocolate, well stocked minibar etc, and most importantly a comfy bed. In comparison with most London hotel rooms well above average. The bar is in a dimly lit basement, perhaps lit so that you can't read the prices! but staff chatty and attentive. Breakfast was first-class with a great full English which was perfect, tasty bacon and black pudding. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.",5,2013,05,26
115,Lovely hotel,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is in a fantastic, central location - near SO much, yet sits back on a nice, quiet street. The rooms are lush and the staff was enormously helpful. My partner woke up with a bad cold on the day we were supposed to check out; I asked if we could stay an extra night but in a cheaper room. At noon, which should've been check-out time, they brought up keycards to our new room so that we could just move our stuff to the new room and get settled right away. It was very thoughtful and much appreciated. (Incidentally, there was almost no difference between the cheaper room (418) and the more expensive room (315) we stayed in. In fact, 418 actually seemed to have more living space, while 315's bathroom was much larger (although 418's was plenty large enough).

One word of warning: the breakfast is VERY expensive. The cold breakfast is a buffet for 15 pounds (that's a lot of money for a bowl of granola) and the hot breakfast (ordered off a menu) is 21 pounds. There's a Garfunkel's around the corner, and while it isn't the best breakfast in the world, is adequate and considerably cheaper.",5,2013,05,26
115,Did not live up to expectations!,"We stayed 2 nights here recently and as we don't go away very often we splashed out and booked a suite. On arrival in our room we found a hand written note, which I thought was a nice touch, to welcome us to the hotel as 'our guest' and please come to the bar for a complimentary cocktail.  We duly went down to the bar, ordered a drink each and showed the card to be immediately told that this card was only for one drink. I thought was a bit cheap considering what we'd paid for the room (almost £400/ night) and in all honesty it would have been better not to offer anything at all than just one complimentary drink for my husband, dressed up in a hand written note which was quite misleading.  We ordered 2 cocktails anyway and were told a further 2 times by bar staff we'd have to pay for one.  At NO point did we question or dispute this or ask for 2 complimentary drinks. I felt quite embarrassed and wondered if they thought we couldn't afford their drinks prices??? I ordered a Mojito but was then informed that they had no fresh mint so I would have to pick something else.  In the end the complimentary cocktail ended up being one I didn't want and had to pay 12 quid for! 

The room itself was lovely but there was a very squeaky door outside in the corridor which woke me up several times in the early morning. The fire alarm went off inexplicably in our room about 3am for about 30 seconds one night, we went out to investigate but no-one seemed to be evacuating the hotel so I have no idea if it was only in our room this happened? 

The bathroom was beautiful and had a roll top bath in front of a TV.  It would have been nice if bubble bath had been left in the room to go with the bath and nicer still if the TV remote worked, which it didn't, we finally managed to get a TV channel on but the sound coming out of the speakers was completely out of time with the pictures, making it unwatchable anyway.  There was also a set of scales in the room which didn't work...it may seem petty but what's the point of having stuff like that in the room if it doesn't work, especially when we were told when we checked in we had the best room in the hotel.

We booked a trip on the London Eye online and went down to reception to ask if we could print out the confirmation in order to collect tickets, we were told we could use one of the 2 computers at reception.  We couldn't get either to print and asked for assistance.  The receptionist couldn't get the printer working either and after shouting to the concierge - who either ignored her, or didn't hear her - she shrugged her shoulders and walked off leaving us to it.  We never got the printer to work and no-one seemed too bothered or very helpful.  

After reading the reviews here we were expecting a much better experience and unfortunately it just didn't live up to our expectations. We paid a lot of money for our stay and expected to be a bit pampered and while the location is great and the hotel is very clean I wouldn't book it for a luxury stay again as the service just wasn't up to it.",3,2013,05,22
115,Great location,"Stayed more than 3 nights recently - best is location on a quiet street but close to Brit Museum, Bloomsbury, Covent Garden, Seven Dials area. Door staff were attentive and helpful (Kashif) - desk staff less so.  We were in back - noise from street behind when dumpsters were dumped from the adjacent theater back stage door were unwelcome sound at 6am.
We would go back - mainly for the location.",3,2013,05,22
115,An Absolute Gem,"My husband and I wanted to visit the British Museum and so I used Tripadvisor to find a hotel nearby. What a gem I picked! The Bloomsbury Hotel  made our stay in London into a wonderful experience.
As we approached the hotel, the door was opened for us and we were greeted with a friendly, 'Welcome to the Bloomsbury Hotel'. We were guided to reception and our luggage was taken care of. The young lady at reception continued the good impression with her warmth and efficiency. (I am of the firm opinion that how you are treated at reception influences your impression of the hotel.) 
I had booked a superior double room which proved to be comfortable and spacious enough for a few day's stay. The room was spotless. The amenities first rate. Thank goodness for some decent coat-hangars! (A minor niggle was that there were only two little tubs of milk. We drink numerous cups of tea on a morning!)
Wherever we went in the hotel we were greeted by friendly helpful staff. Someone has done an excellent job at staff training.
Breakfasts were very good. There was a wide variety of choices for the Continental Breakfast which was well displayed. There was an equally wide choice of cooked breakfasts. (Again a minor niggle. There were several Irish and American newspapers in the breakfast room but very few English papers. As result my husband was forced to have a conversation with me over the breakfast table. We have never done this in over thirty years of marriage.)",5,2013,05,22
115,Trip to London,"My Husband and I , my son and his girlfriend recently stayed at this fab hotel , we were staying over and going to Ronnie Scotts.  The welcome at check in was lovely and friendly and the iced lemonade very welcome!!  lovely room and so very quiet hard to believe in London.
We were made to feel very welcome and all the staff were so friendly , we would highly recommend this to our friends and will certainly stay there again we wish we could of stayed longer!",5,2013,05,22
115,Can't fault this Hotel,"Stayed with business for two nights this is an excellent hotel, amenities and staff are so helpful and pleasant.  Room service was lovely and there was a great fresh selection of food at breakfast.  Could not do enough to make my stay any more comfortable.   Will definately stay again.  ",5,2013,05,22
115,Great London hotel,"Stayed at hotel Sunday 19th May, and would thoroughly recommend to travellers. Great location - 5min walk to Soho and music bars in Denmark Street. Easy access from tube and Euston Station. Rooms luxuriously appointed, and spotless. Staff extremely helpful and friendly. 
Nothing at all to complain about and prices for the leisure break extremely competative when booking directly via the hotels own website. We will come back again as location for shopping, and nightlife is great.
Joanne",5,2013,05,20
115,Very happy traveler,"We stayed at this hotel during one of my business trips at London. The hotel is centrally located and there's easy access to many of the attractions in Centra London. The hotel staff are very courteous and extremely helpful. Paolo (our concierge), went out of the way to organize a few things for us. The Check-in /check-out process was a breeze. We also had the Afternoon tea at the hotel, food quality was very good, however, the presentation could have been fancier.  

For those interested in shopping, there are many shops close by and if the weather is nice and warm, you would enjoy the walk.",5,2013,05,20
115,Very Happy Customer,"A very centrally placed Hotel offering a friendly welcome. Nothing was too much trouble for any member of the staff and as an elderly person, travelling alone, I found them very helpful.

The room I had, was a quality room and very comfortable. There are plenty of gadgets and interesting pieces of equipment, but the general comfort is very good.

The food on offer was quickly produced and very appetising, so I was a happy guest. My Thanks to all the staff.

115,Eleven out of Ten,"From check in to check out this hotel delivers first class service all the way. This really is a top quality venue. All the staff are impeccable which is the icing on the cake for this hotel as the location, comfort & quality of food is nothing short of amazing.

The bed and pillows is as comfortable as any I have ever slept in, add the ipod dock and coffee machine in room leaves nothing but total satisfaction.

We had breakfast and a three course lunch in the restaurant all of which was faultless. The eggs Florentine come highly recommended.

If you are thinking of visiting London and want a little bit of luxury in a fantastic location then look no further than the Bloomsbury Hotel",5,2013,05,17
115,Wonderful Weekend at the Bloomsbury Hotel,"Last weekend i stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel for the second visit.
it goes without saying that in a hotel of this standard you would expext, fabulous decor, excellent food, and spotless rooms.
But what sets this hotel apart from the usual ""faceless chain hotels"" in London is the staff.
Within an hour of us checking in the staff knew my son's name, and he was made to feel especially welcome.
The staff in the front hall, and on the front desk were especially friendly and seemed to all really enjoy the ""service"" part of their job.
So highly recommended, and great location too!",5,2013,05,17
115,Pick it for the location; enjoy it for the service,"I stayed here because of the location (close to the office for my business trip), but I have to say that I would gladly come back on vacation any time! The staff is incredibly warm and welcoming. My room was not big by any standards, but was beautifully decorated - the modern decor somehow works with the historical atmosphere, the bed was extremely comfortable as well.

My only complaint is that the shower head faced directly at the shower door, so the bathroom floor got a bit wet as I got into the shower - it would have been better to have it face the wall, but who knows if that was even a possibility when they were designing/redesigning. The staff gave me the option of waiting for a room with a bath or checking in early in this room with only a shower and I didn't care, so it really was my choice. I never bothered to mention it during my stay because it was simple enough to let the bathmat soak up the water (it's not my house, after all). But with the rest of the hotel being near perfect, this seemed out of place.

I hope to travel back to London again and stay at my new favorite hotel!",5,2013,05,14
115,"Great room, great location, great hotel!","Stayed for a weekend as a surprise for my fiancé. Had booked this hotel because I thought I got a good deal on the price. Arrived just before 2pm, reception staff were friendly and welcoming. Our room was 528, a superior room on the back of the hotel. Nice and quiet. The room was tastefully decorated, nespresso machine along with the usual tea and coffee facilities. Bathroom was clean. Breakfast was a continental Buffett and then a menu service for a full English. Breakfast staff were friendly, the food was hot and tasty. An unusual touch ordering off a menu I'm more used to a buffet but it was nice nonetheless. Location is just round the corner from the tube, good variety of shops and bars nearby. If you can get a good deal I'd stay here again. Well worth considering. ",5,2013,05,13
115,A lovely hotel,"The Bloomsbury is a lovely hotel very near the British Museum. The staff is polite and helpful--more than willing to go the extra mile to accommodate requests. The lobby is fitted out attractively with comfortable chairs and couches; it readily attracts guests, who read their papers, have a cup of tea or a glass of wine or just chat. The rooms are nice with very comfortable beds and even IPod docking stations. The rooms have plush robes and slippers and a tea tray complete with electric kettle and a variety of teas and coffee and Scottish cookies--very nice for a late afternoon pick-me-up. My only issue was there was no place to put my suitcase. I had such an excellent visit, it was a small price to pay. Many restaurants and shops withint a short walk.",5,2013,05,13
115,Weekend break,My husband and I try to get away to London alone for my birthday each year and have been staying at this hotel for many years now. It has over the past 18 months been rebranded as The Bloomsbury. The rooms have been refurbished in soft muted grey tones with modern accents of silver and black. The bathrooms are modern with all the extra you would expect from a 4* hotel. The bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning just right. We stayed in a standard room but it was very comfortable and quiet.,4,2013,05,13
115,"Beautiful, great service","What stood out for me was the service . The staff were friendly ,attentive and 100% professional. I will definitely be returning to this hotel. The location was very good ,as we were close to soya and Covent garden. The room was small, but perfectly adequate for the job.a big well done ,and thank you to all who made our stay feel very special.",5,2013,05,12
115,Heart of the City..,"This is a Proper Hotel..Set In the centre of London..you can feel the City's Heartbeat from here..Porters await your arrival on the entrance  steps ready  to transport Bags /Case's and all the rest of the stuff you promised yourself you would never buy again.. into the welcoming interior..Check in was flawless...the room was good..we were in an Attic on the 8th floor..though they probably don't call it an Attic .. it was spacious..and had all mod cons..we were very happy with it..

They have a pre show menu for those attending the theatre..which was very good..the Dinner  menu was I think a little pricey..but the food is good..Breakfast is a joy..they even have a box to keep the croissants warm..such things Impress me..I know..I know..But I have lived a sheltered life..All I All ..a good place to stay and see the greatest City in the World..",4,2013,05,11
115,"Location, location","I enjoyed my stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel. The location is excellent: within walking distance of Soho and Covent Garden, and close to cultural attractions such as the British Museum. My room wasn't huge, but was a good size for London; the bed was comfortable, with nice linens. Staff were pleasant and eager to please. ",5,2013,05,11
115,Very nice!!,"Beautiful hotel owned by the Doyle's.   Fast check in, the staff was attentive and pleasant.  The room was nicely appointed with a large marble bath.   The breakfast buffet and menu on the ground floor was ample and delicious, especially the omelet and waffles!  Also, great location close to the British museum.",5,2013,05,11
115,Great hotel,"Thoroughly enjoyed our few nights at the Bloomsbury, reiterate the previous positive reviews. Spot on place, central location, excellent staff, spotless, would definitely recommend and are looking forward to staying again! We had a couple of issues with our rooms, but these were dealt with super efficiently and we were given upgrades! No complaints at all.",5,2013,05,10
115,Great value and location,"Smallish though adequate and thoroughly modernized room. Spotless and quiet and on a quit street, 1 block from the British Museum. Excellent service and always helpful and knowledgible concierge. Flat screen TV's. Free wireless internet. Steps away fro Tottenham Court Road underground and Oxford street. walking distance to Covent Garden and Leicestershire Square. Free Newspapers. Have no complaints and would come here again.",5,2013,05,09
115,Excellent Stay - Special Thanks to Brian Head Concierge,"Just back from a fabulous stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel - from start to finish our stay was simply wonderful. We had been in contact with Brian before our arrival who kindly and efficiently arranged site seeing trips for us during our stay so when we arrived we did not have to waste a second on checking out what there was to do and how to go about booking it. On check in we received a very warm & friendly welcome from Louise and the concierge who staff brought us & our bags to our room. As promised Brain had everything left waiting for us so we were able to start our tour of London and its wonderful sights straight away. We went on the open top bus tour, visited the tower of London & also took a trip on the Eye! Our room was fabulous, spacious & comfortable with everything thing you require - bottled water, hot chocolate for our 6 year old and delicious biscuits! Breakfast both mornings was a feast - with an extensive cold buffet filled with cereals, nuts, fruit, yogurt, breads and a scrumptious menu to choose a range of hot dishes from  - from the traditional Full English to Pancakes to Eggs Benedict served by the most friendly and accommodating staff. The hotel is ideally located just off Oxford Street so we did not have to take a taxi or even a tube during our stay - everything was in walking distance.  Would like to say a huge Thank You to all the Staff at The Bloomsbury Hotel especially Brian & his team for making our stay in London so special - we will be back!",5,2013,05,09
115,The best kept secret in London!!,"I have never written a review before but felt I really must after our stay at the Bloomsbury this bank holiday weekend. Simply everything about our stay was wonderful! From the door men, the concierge to the receptionists with the magic hand towels, the breakfast staff, the chamber maids, in fact all staff were amazing! All said hello, and gave exceptional customer service, in particular Emma who served us numerous times in the bar area and was fantastic! The food was amazing, the steak offer which was available on an evening until 7 was fantastic value for money. Breakfast was also gorgeous, i had eggs Benedict and my husband had the eggs, bacon and spinach, which were so good we ordered the same the next day! I always say you get what you pay for, and having lived previously in London and stayed on many occasions at other hotels I really must say this is the best by far! For a memorable stay that you will never forget I would recommend the Bloomsbury......we will be back soon!!! Thank you.",5,2013,05,08
115,Perfect for Business Trip,"I regularly stay at The Bloomsbury for my business trips. The location is great, very central but not noisy. The building is classy and well maintained.
Rooms are nice and modern, pretty good for a central London hotel.
Nice continental breakfast, with availability of additional à la carte hot selections.
Service is pleasant. 
Ask for Express Check-Out: they leave your invoice under the door the day of your departure and you just have to drop the keys in the special box at the hall (no need to queue at the reception).
Totally deserved 4*. Rates are correct for location and service level.",4,2013,05,07
115,A wonderful experience,"My husband and I recently spent six nights at The Bloomsbury, and it was a terrific experience.

The hotel itself is lovely, the rooms are comfortable, and the staff are extremely attentive.  We felt like we were being treated like royalty.  In particular, we want to thank Paulo (the consierge), Roddy (front desk) and Estelita (breakfast) for being so warm and helpful during our stay.  Other staff were also excellent, but these were the individuals we got to know by name.

We are eager to come back the next time we are in London.  The location can't be beat for the British Museum, the restaurants on Charlottee Street, and public transit accessibility.",5,2013,05,06
115,a nice stay,"stayed in a city suite for one night, the room was large and modern. the bathroom was very well equipped . i found it strange that in a suite they said that you had fesh fruit and flowers. there was lillys in the bathroom strange place instead of the bedroom  or seating area , and the fruit was 2 apples next to the bottled water these apples had seen better days , but i dont really like apples so this did not affect me or my stay . the air conditioning was not working in our room  but my husband never ohoned down to try to get it sorted, so we opened the window this was quite noisy  ut when the windows were closed the room was very quiet.the one thing i didnt like at this hotel was at reception, there was a goldfish bowl with no oxgen weed or a pump and the water was quite low with one solitary goldfish gasping for air in the water, the other compaint i have is that at the bar i asked for a non alcaholic cocktail and the bar person didnt know that cocktail and there was no mention of that one behind the beer so she had to come over to our table and look at the ingredients on the cocktail to make it",4,2013,05,05
115,Super stay at a classy hotel,"This is a stunning hotel in the heat of London just of Tottenham court road.

Easy access to all the main attractions and shops and there is an NCP car park just accross the road.

Rooms are very clean and modern not something you always get in London! so this was a big plus

Speacial thanks to Michelle on reservations that got us in at the last minute and saved a special room for us.

Staff are all very helpful and give you plenty of time if needed, check in & out was a breeze, and breakfast was excellent.

Will be back again for sure",5,2013,05,03
115,outstanding service,"with such a massive choice of hotels in the area all offering around the same price it was lovely to see this hotel has invested so much in it's staff. Without exception the staff were professional yet friendly and extremely helpful. Nothing was too much trouble.
The location of the hotel is excellent, close to Tottenham Court, an easy walk to theatre land and also Covent Garden.
Rooms were all well maintained with everything you would expect from this star rated hotel.
The food was good and well presented.
The hotel was clean and tidy, we noticed one problem which was immediately dealt with.
Wouldn't hesitate to go back again!",5,2013,05,02
115,Excellent Location,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is in an excellent location, within walking distance to Covent Garden, Oxford Street and Leicester Square, and with the British Museum and Tottenham Court Road Tube Station just steps away. The service was generally efficient, and the housekeeping staff were great. While the room was comfortable and had all the necessary amenities, the bed sank in the middle and was thus uncomfortable to sleep in. Also, the air-conditioning did not work well in cooling the room, resulting in a couple of uncomfortably warm nights even though it was set at 18 degrees. We had a room at the back of the hotel, which meant we did not experience any noise issues from the street, although we were awakened in the mornings by doors slamming in the corridors.",4,2013,05,01
115,A Nice Hotel but ...,"We have stayed a number of times at the Kengsington Hotel which we enjoyed very much and decided to try its sister hotel, the Bloomsbury.

This is quite a different hotel with a much different feel, perhaps because of the fact that it is much larger. 

One problem we found up front was the set of stairs leading up to the entrance door. This requires a bit if effort if you have heavy cases. We observed quite a few people struggling up and down the stairs during our stay and the hotel has helpfully placed a sign asking people not to roll bags up and down the stairs to avoid damage. One problem is perhaps that the doormen can't see people approaching ás they seem to stay firmly inside the hotel in cooler weather.

Like the Kensington, the hotel has annoying little fridges that dont allow you to put anything of your own in to keep cool.'

Whilst the hotel was clean and reasonable well appointed, we found the atmosphere somewhat cold. Perhaps it's best suited to business travellers rather than people on holidays as we were.",3,2013,04,30
115,Brilliant Hotel Experience,"This hotel is in a great location close to theatres, travel etc yet tucked away in a quiet side street.  Amazing room, well equipped and spotlessly clearn, slept really well in King bed.  Staff couldn't do enough to help and English breakfast was excellent.  Will definitely visit again, great for weekends in London.",5,2013,04,29
115,Very disappointing!,"We stayed one night in a junior suite-the room was nice but looked like it needed a face lift and sound proofing! We were woken early to someone's tv on next door and drumming outside-you do not expect this in a top hotel in London and in a higher category of room! The room service  breakfast was cold and 2*star standard-you would get better in a Travel Lodge! Also the hotel does not provide parking or even valet. The only good thing about this hotel was the concierge, who not only gave me directions to a restaurant but actually walked me there! We would definitely not stay here again!",1,2013,04,28
115,Average hotel,"This is my second review of this hotel, but this time I can actually comment on the room,food,service. As this was a complimentary nights stay due to the last booking being messed up by this hotel.
We arrived after 2pm and was unable to go to our room as it was not ready ( even though check in time states 2pm) we were offered a complimentary tea or coffee while our room was prepared, which took about 20 minutes, on entering the room we found it to be clean with a lovely decor the bathroom was big and spacious and had complimentary toiletries.
, the mini bar was well stocked as well as the tea and coffee, I'm afraid I cannot comment on the dinner as we did not eat there in the evening.  due to going to see a show.
On our return to the room in the evening there was a nice platter of strawberries,melon,raspberries,cake, dried banana, dried apricots, unfortunately we were unable to enjoy this as it had been there for a few hours and was very warm, 
We had a comfortable night the bed was big and comfy .
We went for breakfast in the morning and the staff were helpful and welcoming my husband had the full English cooked breakfast, and I had the waffle with raspberrys and syrup my husband enjoyed his but unfortunately I did not as my raspberries had mould on them which then put me off my breakfast altogether! 
All in all we had a comfortable stay but I would not pay the prices they ask for a room as I found their sister hotel the marylebone to be of a much higher standard. ",3,2013,04,28
115,A pleasant stay...would consider again,"The Bloomsbury hotel was an overall positive experience, with only a few minor things to improve upon. We would definitely recommend this hotel to those looking to visit London as tourists.  

We found the location to be quite convenient, within a 5 -15 minute walk of major attractions, including the British Museum, most theatres, shopping, Piccadilly circus, Covent Garden, Trafalgar square, Soho and Charlotte street restaurants for example.  The immediate neighbourhood at Tottenham court road and Oxford feels a bit dodgy, but you only need pass by it, and we had no trouble. Tube stations are conveniently accessed, and cab rides are not too expensive given the central location as well. 

We stayed in a premium room, # 308.  Based on room tips on trip advisor, we had asked for a higher room but it was unavailable due to some renovations that were happening on the higher floors (which by the way we were not at all disturbed by, you wouldn't even know it was happening).   Our room faced the back of the hotel and was exceptionally quiet despite being a lower floor, so I wouldn't go by some of the recommendations from people who say lower floors might be noisy. The street in front is almost not used, so I can't imagine any noise even if you faced the front of the hotel. We had neither outside noise nor hallway noise to contend with...if you wanted to, you could sleep all day in this hotel.  The king sized bed was a nice treat in London, especially for the price, as was the large sized room.  The bed itself was a bit too soft for my liking, so it felt like your buttocks was sinking to the floor, but I suspect that with a better frame to support the bed, the mattress itself would have felt fine.  The room was complete with hair dryer, iron and board, Nespresso coffee machine and coffee capsules, complimentary tea and biscuits, bottled water and sparking water, a stocked mini bar (extra cost) ipod docking station, television, a very good hair dryer, loads of power outlets for charging our electronics etc, shampoo, soap and conditioner, body wash, cotton swabs and cutips, two robes and slippers, plenty of clothes hangers...every convenience seemed to be there.  The air conditioning in our room was very quiet, so I'm not sure why others had problems.  The temperature control works fine, once you determine the temperature you are most comfortable with.  

We did not eat in the restaurant however we did visit the bar for a nightcap.   While it is in the lower level of the hotel, it was still quite nice but very quiet and like the rest of the hotel, very dark. This would be my biggest complaint overall...the hotel must cater to vampires because you can't see anything in it. The room lighting was terrible, so expect to look like a clown after you apply your makeup and leave the hotel. And the common areas of the hotel were no different...very dark.  Not dingy...the entire hotel was spotlessly clean...just dimly lit.  I would recommend the hotel install a lit makeup mirror in the bathrooms, or change the lighting.

The coffee, tea and refreshing beverages in the lobby was a nice touch, as was the nightly turn-down service. We did not use the fitness centre so cannot comment on it. 

We had one small incident with our coffee maker seemingly not working, and it took three separate conversations with three different employees over the course of two days before they sent someone to tend to it.  As it turns out, it was our error and we felt sheepish, but that doesn't excuse the lack of urgency with which they addressed the problem.  They did provide us with a complimentary room service coffee for the inconvenience though. 

Overall, biggest pros are size of room, the quietness for sleeping, and convenient location, all in a relatively luxurious hotel with a smaller price tag than others comparable.  Biggest cons were the soft bed which made it difficult to get comfortable despite its large size, and lack of lighting in the room was a big annoyance. 

I rated the sleep quality very good instead of excellent, only because of the soft bed, and rated the service very good instead of excellent due to the lack of attention to the one issue we raised.  But rated the overall experience as excellent and we definitely would consider returning to this hotel when back in London.",5,2013,04,27
115,Outstanding service - great value for money in central London,"I've stayed in many central London hotels in this price range - this one positively stands out of the crowd! Great decor, very clean, lots of amenities, everything worked and quiet rooms. The highlight is the staff though: from the friendly porter at the door to the welcoming reception staff we felt taken care of from the first step into this house. The breakfast service was 5* class: very attentive service, no need to search juice or tea at the buffet, whenever our glasses were empty we were swiftly asked if we'd like another one, eggs et al. cooked to your preference and a lovely choice of breads, fruits, cheeses from the buffet - fantastic!",5,2013,04,27
115,"In the Bloomsbury Hotel in London Soho, you don't have to leave your Comfort Zone","This is ""extended comfort zone"" in the midst of Central London:

near Oxford Street (Shoppers Paradise) and Covent Garden/Soho (Going out Mecca), the Bloomsbury Hotel provides a cozy & comfy environment with a first class service.

From the warm welcome at the entrance and at reception to the ongoing service while being in the hotel - the service is fabulous! 

The interior design is a plushy, country home mix that makes you feel at home easily.

Bar and Restaurant is chic and stylish without being ""too cool to be cozy"".

As you see - ""cozy"" is a relevant term to describe this hotel. That doesn't cost a fortune but offers a lot.

My room was a bit overheated, especially in the bathroom. Here the floor heating was too powerful and made me sweat every time I went there to brush my teeth and do the make up...

Room had wireless internet and was very clean and well cared for.

All in all a very positive experience, I happily share with you. 

Also because the Concierge put some effort into pushing me to do so (in a charming way) when I said that I liked my stay before heading to the exit ;-)",4,2013,04,26
115,"(Mainly) Nice staff, shame about the hotel","Shower door broken. Air-conditioning waking us religiously every 15 minutes, no hot water, not the best of experiences to be honest. The crowning moment was at breakfast where my wife was told that she looked tired. Other than that? Nice staff. Very friendly and helpful. But the hotel room left a hell of a lot to be desired. Won't be going back.",1,2013,04,24
115,Great hotel in a great location with great service,We selected this hotel based on other trip advisor comments. The hotel is very well located in the center of London meters away from the British Museum. The hotel is very attentionate with customers offering a bottle of water and extremely welcoming. Love the nespresso machine in the room with six free capsules. Very comfortable bed and pillows very quiet and very clean. I would stay at this place again no doubts.,5,2013,04,22
115,Great hotel and great stay,"I've stayed there with my husband and son as we went to watch lion king,  the hotel is very impressive, especially the room we've stayed in which was the suite, the service was also very good. I would definitely stay again! Loved it",5,2013,04,22
115,One of Londons Gems.,"I've got to say, their service in every department was amazing. They're friendly and helpful and get things done when they're asked.
Finding the room was like a maze, but that was fun. The decor and feel of the hotel was great! Beautiful statues, wonderful aromas and soft lighting.
The room was good, just a shame the minibar was making a loud noise from the second day. The bed was comfy and the bathroom was beautiful. 
The size the same, if not slightly larger than a premier inn room. I don't think it was worth the amount I paid..

Almost Everything about this hotel was great! I will be staying here again, in around 8 weeks time. 

Pros:
Location
Service
Atmosphere
Food
Decor and furniture, both in the hotel and in the room

Cons:
Size of the room
Price",5,2013,04,21
115,My favorite place to stay - ANYWHERE!,"I just came back from a 5-night stay at the Bloomsbury, and it's truly my favorite hotel. The staff is gracious, kind, and anticipate any need you may have. I stayed in a studio suite this time around, and was blown away by the sheer size of the room and how well it was appointed it was. It's an incredible value for the type of service they provide and the location.",5,2013,04,21
115,"The most wonderful hotel stay I’ve ever enjoyed, and I’m spoiled!","From the moment I reached the wonderful doorman Mario in his bowler hat and traditional suit, I had the loveliest experience ever in a hotel stay, and that is saying a lot.  I left Amanpuri resort hugging my assigned assistant and crying with her as my stay was so lovely, but nothing matched my experience at the Bloomsbury Hotel so near the British Museum.

After weather-related terrible delays getting to London, I was desperately late for my appointment for the difficult-to-get Ice Age Exhibit at the British Museum.  I got to the Bloomsbury Hotel with 10 minutes’ time to reach the museum.  Roddy was at the desk taking care of every problem to get me checked in, my bags to my room and a bottle of water for me in my jet-lagged, frazzled, exhausted state.  I promptly spilled the water over the front desk area.  They were gracious and kept working for me as the rushed to save papers and equipment I had just “christened.’  Thanks to them, I reached the exhibit on time.

I returned to the hotel to have Jonathan serving me in the warm, yet chic lounge.  He was a delight helping me learn this area of London better after usually staying at the Marriott County Hall and the Kensington area.  I got to my room and it was warm and beautiful while efficient and meeting every need.  The young gentleman at the front desk was in my room in about 1 min. when I had difficulty getting the internet in my jet-lagged stupor (It was actually easy to get and free, I simply wasn’t functioning!).  He set up my new, complicated power transformer in addition to this help and graciously refused a gratuity.

The next morning Roddy saw me on my way to breakfast with a heavy bag and escorted me while carrying the bag and seeing that I got the perfect treatment at breakfast.  The smoked fish that I love was heavenly and every offering was delicious and of the highest quality.

As I was waiting to meet a friend for lunch, Nalif at the concierge desk and Andrea at the front desk arranged VIP tickets for my friend and I to attend the sought-after Pompeii exhibit at the museum as Roddy helped me with everything from a problem with my air reservation to Malta to arranging to rush me to Heathrow airport after this second museum visit.  The bell staff personally escorted my friend and I to the museum and introduced us to the ticket-taker/VIP service at the door to the exhibit.

As an avid traveler, this was my first trip after two difficult injuries and a challenging illness with a related weight gain, so I wasn’t traveling in top form.  It could have been a disaster.  Thanks to the amazing staff at the Bloomsbury, it was the perfect trip – and they took care of it all!",5,2013,04,21
115,Best kept secret in London,"Hotels, even in this category, can often be a little impersonal. Not the case here  - I don't know how they do it but everyone has a very genuine warmth about them, stepping through the doors is like coming home. Similarly the ambiance is elegant and relaxed with attention given to detail yet without being ostentatious. A remarkable place, we thoroughly  enjoyed spending our anniversary here and applaud everyone that made it so special. There are not too many hotels that one would go out of there way to visit but this certainly is one.",5,2013,04,19
115,Great hotel - great location,"Stayed here for one night recently after a gap of 4 years. This is still a very well run hotel. It is very well appointed and the staff are helpful and courteous.
I was attending a conference in the hotel and the catering was excellent.
It is a great location being just 2 minutes from Tottenham Ct Rd underground station.
I have no hesitation in recommending it.",5,2013,04,17
115,"Quality, comfort, friendliness and excellent location, topped with good value","We spent 3 nights from 11th to 14th April to celebrate 44 years of marriage. We were given a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe room, upon arrival. Excellent room and so quiet, considering you are in the heart of London. Restaurant was excellent, and food and wines were not expensive. Staff were always attentive. Great location, and most theatres within 15 minutes walk. Will definitely go back to the Bloomsbury.",5,2013,04,16
115,2nd visit,"We have just had our 2nd stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel staying in room 424.
All areas of hotel lovely and clean and very trendy.  The room very warm even with air con on so I wonder if it was working properly? Found the bathroom to be on the small size this stay.
Breakfast excellent and good service from all the waiting staff.

Ordered a newspaper on check in but did not get it delivered.

Would stay here again.",4,2013,04,15
115,"Good breakfast, great location","Stayed here for 5 nights, booked a deluxe room which was small & had very little storage space for clothes/belongings.  Luckliy we were asked to move to another room after 1 night as they needed to work on the air con on our floor so we were upgraded to a larger room with more storage space so this was a blessing in disguise for us as we were staying in london for a week so needed storage space. At check-in the receptionist was friendly & helpful, the breakfasts were excellent as was the service, every morning we were greeted by name with a smile & all the staff in the morning couldn't do enough for you.  We only used the bar & ate in the hotel on the first evening - the bar staff weren't as friendly & helpful as breakfast staff & the restaurant food was only ok so we chose to eat/drink out for the rest of our stay.  There seemed to be a lack of concierge/doormen during the weekend & when they were around a couple of them didn't even acknowledge us, they seemed to prefer to whisper amongst themselves. I think perhaps they prefer to deal with corporate customers rather than couples but as we only needed to use them once it didn't really affect our stay.  Overall we enoyed our stay here but as I say this seems to be more of a corporate hotel than leisure.  The hoursekeeping was good as was the cleanliness of the hotel but we didn't like the toiletries. Would recommend this hotel for short stays due to the price & location & the breakfast will set you up for the day.",4,2013,04,15
115,"Very nice location, Clean and Convinent","The location is very convineint very close to Tube station and Fitzrovia area, which is quite nice for dining. The hotel is very clean rooms are nice.

115,Excellent hotel,"Stayed at The Bloomsbury for one night in April. This is an excellent hotel in an ideal location, very close to all major attractions. The breakfast was lovely to start you off ready for a busy day. Would definately recommend and stay again.",5,2013,04,14
115,Thank you to the Bloomsbury for excellent consistent service and welcome.,"From the hot towel at check in to the complimentary coffee along with my wake up call, this hotel really knows how to do 'personal touches' well. The staff were friendly and welcoming throughout my stay. The hotel is in a superb location for theatre and shopping and only a couple of minutes from a main tube line. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in London now, whether on business or pleasure. If you haven't stayed here I cannot recommend it enough! Comfy beds, brilliant breakfast (especially the eggs Benedict), wonderful decor , it really does have a welcoming and comfortable feel. I stay at many hotels around the world but always look forward to checking into the Bloomsbury! 
Thank you, and see you next week for. Twenty something more nights!

115,Great Location,"Great location.  Within short walking distance to the British Museum, tube station, shops (Boots/Sainsburys) etc.  The room felt a little small, but the room had nice touches - great TV, bathrobes and slippers and a kettle to make teas.",4,2013,04,13
115,Fantastic location beautiful interior,"Loved my stay at this hotel everything  about my three night stay was exceptional from the decor to the room the beautiful lobby area the staff the unexpected upgrade. This hotel is beautiful the seating is so comfortable the lobby bar is so attractive the location bedside Oxford street and Tottenham court Tube is just fantastic. The neighbourhood around the hotel is full of independent shops and businesses and is a lovely part of London. His hotel is Irish owned and the attention to detail was amazing. The hotel interior makes a perfect backdrop for photos. My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights in August 2012 and it made our visit to London very special. We were in London for the wedding of two friends at the Ritz, I encouraged two other friends to stay at this hotel also they each had their own rooms and were delighted with my choice. The Bloomsbury hotel was like a home away from home. I loved my room the bed was so comfortable and I had a iPod docking station so I could listen to my music. The bathroom was beautiful. Do stay at this hotel you will not be disappointed. ",5,2013,04,12
115,Customer service was amazing,"We stayed here for two nights with 4 month old twins. The staff were very helpful especially the guys on the door who helped us carry our large amount of luggage. The concierge were extremely helpful and friendly. I think the concierge was called Gary but may have the name wrong. Went to boots for us to pick up something we needed for the babies and didn't take any money from us for his trouble. He also came and spoke to us and gave advice on local attractions. Checking up on things that interested us. 
The room: was clean and although we couldn't get our large double pram along the corridor this was stored for us and we were offered help to our room with the babies should we have needed it. The room was a good size for us and we had space for our 2 mosses baskets. One downside for me was not having a window with a view as ours faced onto a wall. However we don't normally go away to sit in the room. Location was also good with a car park just across the road.  I would recommend this hotel and would return if I was back in London. ",5,2013,04,12
115,Fabulous Central Hotel,"From the moment we checked in until the check out the experience at The Bloomsbury was a wonderful one. We were welcomed by Mikel at reception and checked in easily. Our room was lovely - a good size with a desk, bottled water, lots of tea & coffee (and a Netspresso machine!) and a welcome present of two very delicious lemon pastries.

The room had ensuite with a shower, which was lovely - plenty of towels and a robe & slippers to relax in. There were local interest magazines for people who might need information about the area, which was a nice touch.

We were in London to visit the Pompeii exhibition at The British Museum, which meant that the location of this hotel was perfect (it's less than a 5 minute walk away). It's also just round the corner from Tottenham Court Road and the shopping delights of Oxford Street too, so a fantastic location for people wanting to explore London.

Room service was brilliant (we fancied a hot chocolate and a milkshake around 11pm and they were delivered promptly and very tasty!) and the bed was very comfortable and a good size - we both had a very good nights sleep.

The breakfast (included in the price) was the best breakfast I have ever had at a hotel, if not anywhere! There is a buffet with fresh fruit, cheeses, pastries, cereals, porridge and fruit juices but also a hot breakfast menu. I had some cheese and fruits and a full English, which was one of the best I have ever eaten. My partner had pancakes followed by porridge, which were equally as good. 

We had a lovely nights stay at The Bloomsbury and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a treat or a romantic night away in central London. Thanks for such a wonderful experience!",5,2013,04,11
115,"Stayed for business, will be back","My office is in the Bloomsbury area and I've stayed at a number of hotels - this is my favorite in the neighborhood.  Nice, comfortable, clean rooms.  The location really can't be beat.  The staff were exceedingly nice, helpful and friendly.  There is a bar downstairs that stays open pretty late which was welcome after a long day at the office and late meetings.",4,2013,04,10
115,lovely hotel,"lovely, comfortable hotel in an excellent location.
the doormen are superb BUT surprisingly, for a hotel - the restaurant is excellent.
There are many restaurants nearby but the hotel restaurant is excellent and their wines are good, with a wide variety by the glass. 
We used it a lot but almost overlooked it and only got round to using it when one of us was exhausted. After that, we stayed in!",4,2013,04,10
115,Beautiful Hotel - American Business Traveler,"The hotel is absolutely gorgeous and rooms are in fantastic condition with high quality furnishings. The tea/coffee spread is abundant and they even provide an electric kettle! 

My room was a bit small but surprisingly comfortable given the size. My one gripe is the shower - which it appears is specific to this room type. There's no way to avoid a face slap of water when you get in. After discovering an American electric outlet which worked on my hair flatiron when my adapter/convertor did not, I was sold on this place.",4,2013,04,10
115,Brilliant Bloomsbury !  Fantastic location for a London break,"I have just returned from a two night stay at The Bloomsbury hotel with my husband. We were visiting London for a weekend break, art exhibitions and a show.

Our first impressions were good. On request we were upgraded to a quiet room at the side of the hotel. The staff couldn't  do enough  to help familiarise us with the hotel. the room was comfortable and a good size. A nice touch after a long journey was the complimentary iced tea or lemonade.
The location was excellent.We walked to most of the art galleries which was relaxing.
The bar staff were helpful and effecient.
 On the second night we decided to eat at the hotel as we had had a fairly hectic day. we sampled cocktails at the restaurant bar which were good. However I wouldn't recommend eating here. There was little atmosphere in the restaurant which was almost empty. The sea bass and chips were a tasty expensive option on a limited menu. In retrospect we wish we had eaten elsewhere. The cheese and biscuits were ok but again expensive with soggy biscuits. However the breakfast was good, again super friendly staff.
We only ate breakfast on the first day choosing to eat out on the second day as there are many good choices elsewhere at a fraction of the cost.
Our only negative comment on our room was the noisy air conditioning system. Otherwise the bed was really comfortable and the bathroom stylish. We have stayed in several London hotels and this was undoubtedly the best by far. Staying here is an excellent choice as long as you are prepared to spend money. W e found the cheapest deal on booking.com.
I would stay at the Doyle collection again mainly due to the outstanding and consistent friendliness and effeciency of the staff . A rare find in a London hotel. Also it would be hard to beat the location!",5,2013,04,10
115,An excellent choice,"I am a very frequent business traveller and spend more nights in hotels than I do in my own home. This does mean that I have learned to see past the first impression and into the sustainable qualities that afterwards remain.

While in agreement with some of the reviews of this hotel that hold some negative remarks about the air conditioning, and also about the somewhat limited views from the windows of this hotel, I have to point out that the air conditioning is being replaced, and never will be able to be totally silent (unless switched off) and that anyone wishing for an amazing view from their hotel room would do well to choose a location other than in one of the busiest city areas possible. Clearly the qualities of this hotel lie in other areas and its location is about proximity not beauty.

My well supported view of this hotel, having stayed here in excess of 200 nights all told, is as follows. It is an elegant building which is well looked after and decorated in a subtle and sophisticated manner. While the facilities of this hotel are nothing other than expected from any four star luxury hotel, it does point out how so many others do fail to meet the standard set by this one. What is far more important than both the building and its facilities however is the vital part that makes or breaks every hotel visit... the staff. Importantly, the staff of the Bloomsbury are the single most impressive team I have ever witnessed in all of my travels. While the housekeeping staff keep the rooms impeccably clean and well presented, they also come by each evening to offer to turndown your bed sheets in readiness for you. The concierge are always most willing to warmly greet you while opening the door for you, and are happy to take your luguage to and from your room, or to store it for the day awaiting your return. They will readily await your taxi in the rain while you wait in the lobby. The reception team are always happy to assist with anything you might ask of them and even kindly offer you a bottle of water upon checkout. 

The breakfast is a delicious and impressive feast which would provide anyone more than enough to start them on their day, and is beautifully executed too. They also have a wonderful steak and wine combination very affordably available on the bar menu or for room service. Their cocktail bar is a stylish and impressive feature and capable of delivering a variety of cocktails that are very hard to beat in terms of enjoyment and also value. 

Free wifi and even wired connections in the rooms are another must for any business traveller and this is the first one I have ever known to have never failed on any single visit. All the rooms now have iPhone/iPad powered dock and speakers too. 

Comparing the hotels in the very local vicinity I have failed to find one as pleasant as this and certainly have found several that are more expensive despite being in my opinion a less enjoyable hotel to visit. All in all, almost every hotel I have stayed in has failed to deliver a great experience in some way and on almost every visit too, and the Bloomsbury has yet to fail in almost any way after 200 nights and counting. I would challenge anyone to find a more consistently good hotel.

I believe in the personal touch, good taste and good manners. This hotel seems to be the epitome of these qualities to me.",5,2013,04,09
115,Really nice place,"My wife and I stayed here for one night while in London for a job interview. I would have never picked this hotel myself but my company did, I am glad they did what an amazing hotel, we could not fault it in anyway. The location is perfect. We will stay again on our next trip to London.",5,2013,04,09
115,Major disappointment; quite a surprise,"First let me say that I am not a harsh reviewer.  Writing this negative review was not easy for me, but one that I felt was justified considering my experience.

I'll start off with the positives: Hotel location is great, rooms are quite clean, and the customer service of the staff is excellent.

Now my ""not so good"" experience: Upon checking in, I was assigned to a room that was quite chilly.  I assumed it was because the room had been vacant for a bit (and it was quite cool in London).  Well 2 hrs later, the room had not warmed up.  So I requested a new room.

I was moved to a second room for the night.  After getting in bed, I was awakened every 30-45 minutes by a loud mechanical sound which kept me tossing and turning all night.  Not sure if it was the elevator or their heating system.  Finally @ 7am, I called and asked to move to another room for the duration of my stay.  They moved me to a third room, which was cold.  But I was assured it would warm up.  I left for work with my fingers crossed.

When I returned later in the evening, I found Room #3 to be just as cold as the first room.  Again, maintenance came to check and I was told that the heating system in the building was being replaced and some of the rooms were being impacted.  By this point, I was totally frustrated with the whole thing and demanded a room that was warm and quiet.

The hotel manager came up, along with another staff member, and moved me to a nice deluxe room where I stayed for the remaining nights.  The TV in the room was dying, so I had to call the concierge to come up and ""reset"" the TV twice.    

4 rooms in a week stay was just too much to handle and really soured me on the hotel.  I'll go back to staying at the Radisson Blu Edwardian, which is where I normally stay when working out of our London office.",2,2013,04,08
115,Excellent Hotel!,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for six nights during Easter 2013.
Our stay was excellent starting from the employees services(I have to mention Brian and Paulo the concierges that was very nice and helpful) through the hotel interior design to the room amenities.
The location was absolutly perfect for our needs, you can walk to almost anywhere in center of London.
We enjoyed it very much!!",5,2013,04,08
115,Great Stay!,"We stayed in a standard room which was well equipped, and is all you need if you just want somewhere to stay for a shopping trip etc. The decor was attractive in the bedroom and bathroom and the ipod docking station was a nice added touch. The only small downside was the view from the window where we could see scaffolding and nothing much else so that wasn't very attractive but we was out most of the time anyway so wasn't a major thing to fuss about. Staff were friendly and helpful, hotel was clean with attractive decor throughout and in a perfect spot for oxford Street shopping as it's only a 5 min walk away. Definately enjoyed our stay and will return when going back to Oxford Street!",4,2013,04,07
115,"Days in London for 60th birthday, Bob & Joyce L.","Booked on trevago, the hotel is brilliant for the West End and walking to all the central sights and theatres.
Great room (deluxe option) and food quality superb, with friendly helpful staff.
Highly recommended.  
Will use again as a base when having days in London.",5,2013,04,06
115,A Great Anniversary,From the moment we arrived we were treated like VIP's. We were upgraded and like the previos reviewer had free champgane sent to the room by the ever attentive general manager. All the staff were helpful and friendly and the breakfast was excellent. The room exceeded our expectations and last but not least the most comfortable bed. An excellent location for the British Museum as well,5,2013,04,05
115,Great stay at the Bloomsbury,"Staying at the Bloomsbury we had a great short city break to celebrate my wife's birthday. Hotel service, food, bar and gym facilities were excellent and the hotel location is superb for shopping and the West End. Highly recommended.",5,2013,04,05
115,Lush!!!!,"Boyfriend and I went to London to celebrate our two year anniversary. We booked The Bloomsbury Hotel through the Hotel Tonight app - this was brilliant as it meant we saved money on the normal price of a room. The service from the receptionists was impeccable. They could not have done more for us. The room was HUGE! I had to jump to sit on the bed!!!!! They have speakers in the bathroom so you get to listen to TV whilst having a nice relaxing soak in the tub! They even have a cheeky Nespresso machine hidden in the cupboard - my favourite!! The breakfast was so tasty too - and the food was out nice and quickly - our tea and coffee never went below half a cup too - excellent service!

Definitely plan to stay here again!",5,2013,04,05
115,Great location..,"Stayed here for about 7 days and didn't have any problems. The hotel in a great location, just down from The British Museum. It's in a quiet enough area that there isn't too much road noise that you can hear in the rooms. Covent Garden and Soho are about a 10 minute walk and there is a grocery store nearby to get anything you might need. The room was a bit on the small side for the price, but this is London so I expected that. The lobby was clean and cute, the halls smelled nice. Overall a great place that I'd recommend",4,2013,04,05
115,Superb trip,"My wife and I have never had such a fantastic stay in a UK hotel. From arrival to departure staff were excellent, very friendly and professional service. On arrival one of the staff overheard us talking to another guest about why we were there, it was our anniversary, our room was then upgraded for free and champagne sent to our room, all courtesy of the hotel. The suite was very well equipped with everything you could ever need. The bed was perfect, not too soft not too firm. We would have no hesitation in booking this hotel again or recommending it to anyone.",5,2013,04,04
115,Fantastic Easter Weekend!,"Just returned from a long weekend stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel.  London as always was fantastic, the hotel helped to make it a memorable stay, the staff from arrival to departure were nothing short of first class from concierge to the cleaning staff everyone one of them very friendly, polite, and more than helpful. The room was spotlessly clean and the bed one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. To summarise a perfect hotel in the perfect location.",5,2013,04,01
115,"Excellent location, nice and friendly hotel","We stayed here for 3 nights for a city trip.  The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful.   The room was not great: we hardly had daylight because the only window looked out on an inner court.  For the rest, the room was very well equipped (nespresso machine, iron, european power sockets (!)).  The bed was very soft, very good.  We didn't do breakfast nor any other meal here, because there are plenty of restaurants nearby.  Also the British Museum is in the same street, 100 m. further down. Several tube stations in walking distance, the closest is Tottenham Court.",4,2013,04,01
115,afternoon tea,"last week we went to have afternoon tea to the Lutyens Lounge in the Bloomsbury hotel, the experience was just amazing, when we arrived a really nice porter opened  the door for us and we were delighted with the beauty of that place, then the waiter came to us with a smile in his face, introduced him self, and took our coats to the cloakroom, then he showed us our table, took our order,and he served the tea and  the stand. Everything was really good, Jonathan was so nice and helpful with us, refilling tea as soon as our cups were empty, we didn't even touch the  teapots. to be honest the food was not as good as expected but that waiter made the experience become a nice memory

thanks",4,2013,03,30
115,Highly Recommended,"My recent four-day stay could not have been nicer. 

Everything about this hotel is gracious and comfortable. Physically, the building offers a gorgeous incorporation of older public-space architecture with newer in-room features (TV, bathrooms, lighting etc.) On check-in I asked for and was given an upgrade at no additional charge, and had a room with a king-sized bed. The room was very comfortably sized. The room and bath were immaculate. The bed, bedding, linens, bath and all in-room features (including no-hassle wifi) were great. My room was toward the back, so unfortunately it didn't offer much of a view. But it was quiet, and that mattered most to me.

My only note of caution is that, at least in bathrooms configured like mine, there is not a lot of counter space. In addition, the spray of the shower would reach the edge of the sink counter. A hand towel over the toiletries solved that problem.

The staff distinguishes itself. From the warm reception (by Mr McGrath? Perhaps I didn't recall the name right) through every contact I had with the door staff, desk, wait staff, and the concierges, I felt listened to, noticed and cared for. 

Nice touches abound. From the elegant beverage service available near the front desk, to the presentation of the breakfast buffet, to the quality of the drink and meal service available in the lobby, even down to the floating votives in glass vases on each table -- I believe reflect an attention and a form of hospitality that has an underlying kindness to it. Other hotels of course do similar things, but at this hotel it was clear that management has made a commitment to putting a quiet thoughtfulness and beauty into the job of hosting its guests.

The Bloomsbury exceeded my expectations. I won't hesitate to return.",5,2013,03,29
115,oh what a night!,"We recently held a Charity Ball at the Bloomsbury. Cannot thank them enough for the care and attention we received... the staff were amazing,  they worked to our evening's schedule and were completely flexible when service needed slowing and then speeding up. When one table had a little accident pre-service it was undressed and redressed in minutes.  The venue... the  King's Room held 120 diners, a 14 piece band,  dance floor and the bar perfectly. 
To top that, we had booked an over night stay - all i can say is they had to get an eviction order to remove me from the hotel bar at 2  and  my wife from the room 12 next day!  thanks once again to all the management and staff who made it a very successful  and enjoyable evening.",5,2013,03,28
115,A cold bathroom is not really attractive during wintertimes,"We stayed three nights in a Deluxe-Room. Room very small but ok. The attached bathroom is relatively big, however has no heating device at all. Temperatures outside were about minus. However, the reception didn`t care much about that.

In sharp contrast to that the staff in the restaurant is of outstanding quality. In fourty years of travelling worldwide we hardly experienced this friendliness and service-orientation.",2,2013,03,27
115,Wonderful stay!,"My friend and I booked into the Bloomsbury for one night on Sunday 24 March.  The staff were so friendly and helpful, it made our stay so special.  Thanks to Malaka and colleagues - we will certainly return when we book another show in London - it is within easy walking distance for the theatres.  So pleased we made this choice, we had a fabulous time!",5,2013,03,26
115,Living the lap of luxury,"Fantastic experience at this lovely hotel. We were there for a special occasion and enjoyed first class service and attention. 
Our room was huge and beautifully furnished with an amazing bathroom - a freestanding bath with its own TV, separate toilet and separate shower; like stepping into an interior design magazine spread. The bed was lovely and big and there was also a chaise lounge to complete the film star feel. Free wifi and lots of nice little touches.
The hotel is impressive with a stylish entrance lobby. There is a comfortable bar downstairs and the bar staff were friendly, we didn't have dinner there but did have the cooked breakfast which was good. It is a historic building from the turn of the century and, doing a bit of exploring, we found an impressive library (used for meetings) and even a chapel. 
There's no swimming pool or gym but it's just a few minutes walk from The British Museum and the West End - and really easy to get around.",5,2013,03,26
115,Excellent Hotel,"Wonderful weekend staying at this hotel.  The weather was terrible but the hotel was brilliant.  We had a lovely room and the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming.  We went to a show on the Saturday evening, but enjoyed a meal at the hotel on the Sunday evening.  The breakfast was very good with plenty of choice and we were not hurried in any way, just left to enjoy the meal, but always a member of staff making sure there was nothing else we needed, and there was no need for lunch as the breakfast was plentiful.  The concierge was very friendly and helpful as was Maria in the restaurant at breakfast.  In fact there was not one downside to this hotel, we will definitely be staying again next time we are in London.  The hotel is in a good position for theatres, shopping and the British museum was just across the road.",5,2013,03,26
115,Fabulous Hotel- Ideal Location and just lovely staff!,"I have stayed at the Bloomsbury a few times in the past few years and it is always an absolute pleasure. I cannot recommend the hotel enough- a central location, impeccable friendly service and beautiful rooms. The staff are so friendly- it was pouring with rain when i last stayed and the doorman went out of his way to find me a big umbrella to borrow so i didn't get soaked. I really feel at home there even when I stay on my own. The breakfast is always a treat and a real cut above your average London hotel fry up. A good choice all round!",5,2013,03,25
115,staff go that extra mile!!!!!,"I booked this hotel as it was close to the theatres in shaftesbury Avenue.  It was a surprise weekend for my husbands 50th . The hotel was extremely comfortable , even though it was quite grand looking, its not starch and stiffy as you might expect.  The concierge and the greeter  at the doors were particularly helpful with one of them (Phil), walking us round to the restaurent, which we couldnt find when we had tried to look for it earlier, in the snow and bitter cold.  He went out of his way and beyond to look after us.  We we very grateful for his help.  The Les Miserable was all of the show that we had hoped for , so all in all any one wishing to have a comfortable and relaxing  hotel the Bloomsbury Hotel is the one for you.",5,2013,03,25
115,excellent hotel,"Super weekend in London. The weather was atrocious but, due to lovely hotel and all necessary amenities didn't mind staying in when i had to. Very friendly and helpful staff. Tasty and filling breakfast, making lunch completely unnecessary! Great location right in the heart of town, ideal for theatres. Would recommend and will definitely stay here again.",5,2013,03,25
115,"Lovely dining room, good service, an oasis in Central London","We had dinner with friends at this hotel, early on a Saturday evening, after a theatre matinee. We hadn't pre-booked, but as we were early they were able to accommodate the four of us.
The main entrance and foyer are welcoming, although quite grand, staff were just so helpful, professional and made things easy for us.
Food is sensibly priced, especially for central London. Served well, delicious, we weren't hassled or rushed, despite the dining room filling up as the evening progressed.
Shall use again, for meeting friends or relaxing alone, when in London. 
Didn't stay as hotel guests so can't comment on rooms.",4,2013,03,24
115,"Great location, service and style","We stayed at the Bloomsbury for a Saturday night in Feb while down to see a West Bridgford end show (privates on parade) 

The show was average, the hotel was anything.but.... Loved it

 Great location - tube 2-3 min walk, Leicester square 10-15 Mun walk

Style was modern values with traditional styling, not tired, very fresh. Lovely breakfast, nice bar to return to and nice foyer to enjoy afternoon tea and relax.

We both really enjoyed the stay and we expect to stay here again

If the review was helpful, please click yes

Enjoy! ",5,2013,03,23
115,"super location, kind staff","We had been to this lovely hotel between Jan 31 and Feb 03, 2013. It was my husband's 40th birthday and I planned this visit as a surprise. The hotel management sent champagne to our room, it was very kind of them. Our room was 504, which was very nice and clean. There was a cattle and nesspresso machine; water, tea, coffee capsules and cookies were free. The concierge and the greeter at the door of the hotel (Abdul and Martin, if I recall correctly) were very helpful and kind. The location of the hotel was super, just one street parallel to Oxford Street, 5 min. walk to British Museum. The Tottenham Court Road metro station was also very close. 
We mostly walked and bought 1 day travelcard which can be used both in metro and bus. You can hop on and off from the bus at any stop you want. It's like using those tour buses but much cheaper. 
Primark which is a very big department store is just around the corner on Oxford Street, it's very cheap and especially kids clothing was very nice. Also Uniqlo, Clarks and Mothercare are other brands where you can shop for relatively low prices. 
I recommend Bocca di Lupo, an Italian restaurant on Archer St., very close to Piccadilly Circus.  The starters and wine were excellent. For good steak you can go to The Hawksmoor, but be sure to make reservation, we couldn't eat there because of that.",5,2013,03,22
115,"If you need help at night, don't stay in this hotel","I stayed in this hotel...the first room was a closet...honestly...was ridiculous.  The ""verbal assault"" of information at the front desk was terrifying...just rattling off information so quickly you can't understand half of it...but the defining moment is when I was assaulted outside this ""hotel"" and not a single hotel employee was around to care. By the time security was outside, the assault was over. I went to the front desk and asked how I could report the assault...the guy laughed (and I'm not exaggerating)...chuckled...and then said you dial 900 (or whatever).  There are lots of expensive hotels in London...loads of them...I suggest staying in one that doesn't sell a standard room/closet and that actually offers security 24 hours a day - not just during the day.  I will NEVER STAY IN THIS HOTEL AGAIN and advise all of you to consider the Covent Garden, Soho Grand or others...ridiculous.",1,2013,03,18
115,"Lovely hotel, great staff in a great location","This beautiful hotel exceeded our expectations.  Every staff member we interacted with was welcoming, knowledgeable and professional, and appeared to really enjoy their job.  The concierges and porters remembered us by name, so the service felt very personal. We made a last minute change to arrive a day earlier than planned, and the hotel accommodated us graciously.  When we arrived, we were upgraded to an executive king, one of the larger rooms at the hotel, with a sitting area and huge marble bathroom, and felt quite pampered.  The location for us was great:  a two minute walk to the British Museum, easy walk to Convent Garden, Soho and  Oxford St. shops, and around the corner from Tottenham Court Road tube stop, with its easy connections to major tourist attractions. There are good and reasonably priced (for London) restaurants nearby; Charlotte Street has several options. We did not get take breakfast at the hotel -- seemed expensive --  but went around the corner to Pret a Manger. Of course London hotel rates are very high, but having researched other hotels in the area before booking this one, I think the rates are not unreasonable for the quality of the room and service. Also, the hotel offered a discount for stays of more than two nights, which was helpful.",5,2013,03,18
115,"Central location, spacious rooms","This was my second time at The Bloomsbury Hotel, and the experiences were consistent. This is an excellent hotel with a good central location - in my opinion there isn't much immediately around it (I'm not a first time tourist), but everything is within a 10-20 minute walk or tube ride. 

The rates really varied by night - some were a great value (including weekends), and some not so much (mid-week prime!). But, the room size is spacious and considerably more than comparable hotels elsewhere in the city (I had a Superior Queen with both stays).

Service was professional - prompt check-in (and my room was even ready early, which was a great treat), the door men are friendly. Free wifi, water, tea, coffee and biscuits are a nice bonus.

A few constructive points:
- I tried to ring Housekeeping about 3 different times over my 6 night stay, and it always went to someones voicemail. I ended up calling Reception instead. It would have been nice to be able to quickly connect to Housekeeping.
- The lighting in my room (717) wasn't too great. There was a dimmer switch and I had it all the way up (I checked!), but it was still hard to see - especially the thermostat. There was a window, but it didn't get direct light. On a positive note though, Engineering had to come with a flash light to help with the Thermostat (he couldn't read it either!), and he was very professional.
- For the size of the room, the bathroom (though it had a full tub), was very small. It would have helped if there was a pocket door instead of a traditional door ... or if the bathroom was just in better proportion with the size of the room.",4,2013,03,14
115,Customer service of the highest standard,Tea for two in the bar area followed by a stunning meal in the restaurant. The service from the doorman to the service staff all made the experience every bit the quality of the one of the most professional but friendly hotels I have ever experienced!!  Made our visit pre show an great evening!,5,2013,03,13
115,Great hotel,"Got say this was a great hotel in a great location.  

The room was well equipped.  Espresso machine, dressing gowns, good soaps, great biscuit.  Fresh lemonade when we arrived.  Good meal and good price.  Polish waiter very friendly.  (Some staff a little stuffy but a small carp on my part)

Soho is only a few minutes a way.  Handy for British museum and all other attractions.  My wife and another couple loved it",5,2013,03,11
115,Expensive but worth it,"A wonderful place to celebrate a significant birthday.  We stayed three nights.  The location close to theatres, Britiish Museum, Oxford Street, etc is very good.  Our room was delightful though a little too warm; the restaurant had very helpful and friendly staff and offered high quality food.  We had dinner each evening and were never disappointed.  Overall the staff in this hotel are excellent.  Nothing appears to be too much trouble; they appear happy, busy and very courteous.  For a retired couple looking for a good place in London for a few nights, this is a nice hotel even though it's quite expensive!  We would certainly consider a further visit.",5,2013,03,11
115,Fabulous,"My husband and I stayed at The Bloomsbury this week-end for my birthday (Fri 8th-Sun10th March), we were very lucky to stay in one of the suites, incredibly spacious and comfortable, together with the largest on-suite I have ever seen and beautifully clean. We were made to feel very welcome by every member of friendly and helpful staff. When you walk in to the lobby there is a wonderful aroma from the floating candles that are placed on the window ledges. The breakfast was the nicest I have eaten in a hotel, with a wonderful continental selection followed by a freshly cooked Full English, as opposed to the normal buffet style you get in most hotels. There is nothing we did not like about this hotel and would HIGHLY recommend it, not only for the amazing location but also for the high quality of service. Thank you to The Bloomsbury for making my birthday week-end the best it could possibly be, and we look forward to returning again later in the year.",5,2013,03,11
115,Great stay in wonderful hotel!,"My partner booked flights to London the night before we were to arrive as an impulsive birthday present for me, but didn't book a hotel as he knows I'm very picky when it comes to where I'm staying. Considering we booked last minute, I didn't have high expectations! The Bloomsbury Hotel, I have to say, is definitely one of the best hotels I have stayed in in London. The location, just of Oxford St, is incredible. We were in the center of everything yet came back to a peaceful and quiet environment.. All staff were very good, always making sure we were ok and they were all so friendly..even at very busy breakfast times! Breakfast was of such a vast variety having the buffet and being able to order from the kitchen meant a great start to a busy day of sight seeing.. Will definitely be back there soon as the experience was just perfect! And a quick shout out to the smiley and hilarious Alma from Dublin, her laugh and wit definitely brightened up our mornings and we wish her the best of luck on her placement!",5,2013,03,06
115,Wonderful weekend!,"Although I travel quite a lot, and have lived in different countries,including England, and London, the Bloomsbury Hotel is the first I want to praise on the Web. For us, the weekend special had to be central, and surprise! it was also quiet. Smiling service everywhere, and efficient. High praise for our breakfast where I was treated to a hot gluten-free breakfast -eggs Benedict-! n addition to buffet spread. The restaurant is so pleasant we had dinner there too. There is a Seamus Heaney library -better for wet weather, but well-stocked! Before leaving, I used the lovely MAC in the spacious lobby to answer emails. I live in Paris, and have recommended the Bloombbury Hotel in French already on Tripadvisor.",5,2013,03,05
115,"Fantastic Hotel, Fantastic Staff!","On a recent trip to London to celebrate my partners birthday, we were having great difficulty in choosing a restaurant to eat at before attending a show for the evening (so many to choose from!), one of the concierge's i think his name was Paolo was so very very helpful in recommending a restaurant ,we are difficult to please and have very different tastes in food! but have to say his recommendation was top notch! Thank you Paolo and thank you Bloomsbury for an fantastic stay, want to come back real soon!",5,2013,03,03
115,Great Service and Great Location,"The bellman was great at giving brochures and help with the amenities in the room upon checking on to the hotel. Upon check out he was helpful at finding us a taxi that would accept a credit card as we were out of GBP. There was always apples, tea, and lemonade in the lobby and cookies, hot chocolate, tea, and expresso in the room. Very close to the British museum and Sir John Soane's  Museum and metro to everywhere you might want to visit.

On down side, the room was small as was the bathroom .",4,2013,03,03
115,"lovely, wanna go back","nice people, luxurious hotel, excellent cocktails, super comfortable beds, fast wifi, and the very appreciated express check out, that gave me time for a coffee in the morning. On top of that the location is really convenient. If I have to find a negative I would say that standard double rooms are a little bit small.",5,2013,03,02
115,Great staff,"I recently stayed at The Bloomsbury for 1 night and I highly recommend it.  The staff are all exteremely friendly and very helpful, from the poerters, receptionists to cleaners and waiting staff.  You really couldn't fault them.  The standard rooms are small but not a bad size for the centre of town and they are very clean and tiny.

There were a few weird design feature in my room, including the fact that you couldn't turn the hand basin tap to cold water as the mirror on the wall blocked the tap (complicated story but true), and due to a large, static shower screen, I need to actually climb inside the bath to turn the bath or shower on.  However, this did not detract from the loveliness of the room!

My room was near the doors to a staircase so was a little noisy but again, not a major problem.  I would just request a room away from the staircase in future.

I had room service which was delivered very quickly and delicious and the continenntal breakfast was very good indeed.

All in all, I would recommend this hotel, mainly due to the fact that the staff are outstanding.",4,2013,03,01
115,Fantastic Stay,"We stayed for 1 night on 2nd Feb what a great hotel. Check in very slick and extremely friendly staff. We arrived at 10am and our room was available immediately. The room was of a good size, really comfy king bed, very quiet. Breakfast has lots of choice and a very nice restaurant where it is served. Check out again very slick. The gentlemen on concierge were super efficient and kept our bags until our return later that evening, on our return the service was still impeccable calling us a taxi and making conversation about our trip to London. We would definitely stay here on our next visit to London perfect location.",5,2013,02,28
115,An upscale hotel in a great location,"The hotel and service were top notch and it is conveniently located by the British Museum, Soho and  trendy restaurants.  The rooms are moderate size but very comfortable and all the staff were great , helpful , knowledgeable, and attentive.  I can highly recommend this as a place to stay for both the business and casual traveller.",4,2013,02,27
115,Indulgence,"Stayed here for one night on business, couldn't have been better looked after, staff a delight. On arrival met by friendly doormen who escorted me to equally friendly reception staff. At reception a freshly prepared hot towel was offered. The room was equally pleasing with not only teas and coffes but a little coffee maker and section of individual coffee cartons. Toiletries were bliss, gorgeous smell and generous quantities. Dinner was lovely and the bar very seductive ..... With drinks at £11 for a large wine it was a bit pricey. Enjoyed breakfast and on departure was offered a bottle of water for my journey. Will definitely be back",5,2013,02,26
115,Another comfortable stay at the Bloomsbury,"This is the 6th time I have stayed at the Bloomsbury - previous stays both for business and pleasure. On all occasions, I have enjoyed the quiet atmosphere of the hotel and the courtesy of the staff. Some rooms can be a bit noisy especially those on the side overlooking the back entrance to the Dominion Theatre (?). The hotel is ideally placed both for shopping (Oxford Street), sightseeing (British Museum) and for business in the City (Central Line from Tottenham Court Road). Breakfast is delicious through the serving staff are almost too zealous!",5,2013,02,26
115,Good location for a conference,"We have had several one day seminars at this location and it has proved to be very good. The staff are very friendly and they floorplans of the conference rooms are well thought out. When you arrive into the lobby of the hotel it is wonderful to smell the scented candles that they burn at all times to greet your senses. 
I recommend it as the bar area, restaurant area and conference rooms are very nice and the staff is very friendly.",4,2013,02,25
115,Good Location and very comfortable,"Chose this hotel because of the location and it looked nice.  The staff are very friendly and accommodating, our room was lovely, we had a standard room so not huge but v.nice and quiet too.  We didn't have dinner, wish we had, but our breakfast was great. Just a short break wish it could have been longer, but would stay there again when next in town.",5,2013,02,23
115,"Very smart, central London hotel with lovely food!","Very smart, clean and tidy rooms with Nespresso machine (mmm!). Very professional, polite service from start to finish and the breakfast is delicious....I could have stayed in there eating all day!! Along with a great central London location near the theatres - we couldn't have got any better! Highly recommended!",5,2013,02,23
115,Excellent Chef,"I attended a seminar followed by Dinner where we needed to impress our invited guests and this Hotel meet all expectations and exceeded when it came to the food. The food was amazing and the huge effort from sourcing the produce to delivery on the evening was exceptional to say the least.

Overall the Hotel was simply excellent.",4,2013,02,23
115,Style and location,"Chose this hotel because of its location. I stayed at St. Giles hotel nearby ten years ago, and I remember the excellent location. This hotel was found by its tripadvisor rating. The service in the reception was excellent. The room was small, but very nice. A Nespresso coffemaker and an iPod dock was appreciated. The bathroom was nice and the water pressure and temperture very good. I was not able to turn off the aircondition and the noise from this made the sleep quality not too good. The bed was excellent. The breakfast was fantastic; best I've had in a long time.",4,2013,02,22
115,The Bloomsbury Hotel is simply beautiful.,"Staff is friendly, extremely helpful and the interior is gorgeous! 

I have been to the Bloomsbury Hotel more than once, and I would happily recommend it to everyone! Their afternoon tea is classic, and although I only mentioned on the day that I was gluten intolerant, the staff quickly arranged gluten free sandwiches. The outside patio is on the small side, but absolutely lovely in the summer!",5,2013,02,22
115,A stay to remember,"My wife and I had a fantastic time at the Bloomsbury.Not only was the decor and comfort of the highest standard, but the courtesy and politeness of staff made our stay such a memorable experience. The steak dish that we had, washed down with a lovely house sauvignon was excellent value for money and the pre meal cocktails need to be experienced. 
Thank you.",5,2013,02,21
115,Looks good from the website...but worst night sleep I have had for a long time,"This hotel looks look but from the moment I checked in I was disappointed. Check-in took a long time because a) the computer crashed b) the printer didn't work and c) the check-in person didn't seem to know what to do. I ordered some room servicer - the wrong order came, late, and was very poor (the pizza was warm, not hot, and the soup was clearly a packet). But the worst part of the stay was the sauna-like heat in the room. I had to have the air-con on full - which was next to useless - and the windows open, which in Central London means you don't sleep. I drank two bottles of water because it was so hot. And, in summary, barely slept.

I won't be staying here again and would recommend you stay at one of the hotels around the corner, which are cheaper and much better.",1,2013,02,19
115,wonderful stay,"We were fortunate enough to win our stay at the Bloomsbury hotel. The staff are so friendly and helpful particularly Bryan [think thats his name] The location of the hotel is within walking distance of many attractions. The hotel provides toiletries which are quality also plenty of towels. The breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice and again friendly staff. The room although small was comfortable, I would have no hesitation in staying herte again.",5,2013,02,17
115,A lovely weekend at the Bloomsbury Hotel,"A very chic but comfortable hotel.  The staff are attentive and friendly with excellent service throughout our stay.  We had a suite which was absolutely lovely!  Food was also very good.  The hotel is well situated for getting around London.  It is close to shops, theatres and a short walk from the tube.  We have already booked to go back and would thoroughly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,02,17
115,very comfortable hotel,"A very good hotel, the superior room was fairly small but well decorated and very clean.  The Pre-theatre dinner in The Landseer Restaurant  was good value for money and tasty. The staff and service was excellent.  Breakfast was excellent with a wide selection of hot and cold food.

However, we would not recommend the afternoon tea, the sandwiches were dry and we did not feel the quality of the food was equal to breakfast and dinner!! poor value for money.

Great location for The Dominion Theatre and shopping in Oxford Street.

We would definitely stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel again.",4,2013,02,16
115,Just perfect,"We bought our night at this hotel at a charity auction for Happy Child. The hotel is just perfect so much better than the 5 star chains. The staff are so friendly which is a good start. The room was immaculate with luxurious toiletries. 
Perfect location close to the shops and theatres of the West End.
We had cocktails before our show. The staff there must have the best job in the world!! They made sure that the cocktails tasted just right by tasting each one. ( they used a straw as a pipette so don't worry) They could not have been friendlier. We don't often go to London to stay but will stay again for sure.

Thank you everyone",5,2013,02,16
115,Bloomsbury Hotel Afternoon Tea? A total waste of time and money!!,"We have been to several hotels in London for afternoon tea, so we know the standard to expect, and this was not it. Don't waste your money.

The afternoon tea, for a special occasion, was arranged weeks in advance with a notified time of arrival, for January 2013. When we arrived we were directed to a corner of the reception hall, adjacent to the front door, where there were a couple of sofas and side tables. Apparently this is called the Lytuens Lounge?? 
Initially we were given tea or coffee, whilst waiting for the food selection to appear. After our coffee and tea (only English Breakfast or Earl Grey were  available), we were informed they had run out of scones and that these would not be available to us. Interestingly we were given the serving plate of jam and butter and cream for the scones, which they did not provide! What we were offered was what they could scrape up from the kitchen as if they were not expecting us. The uninspiring cake offering was two slightly stale bite-size mini muffins, a “minute sliver” of lemon cheese cake and a bakewell tart cut in half between two (pathetic!). For the savoury selection there were micro sandwiches on a stick (slightly dried up). 
However, for entertainment throughout our “Sumptuous” event, we were treated to watching the Hotel guests coming and going with suitcases via the front door and reception!!

[Please note the food selection, serving stand and ambiance, had no resemblance to what is implied on the Bloomsbury Hotel website, don't be fooled].
 
We hope that this information will be of some help to other potential guests! Perhaps the hotel management should consider whether they wish to step up the quality they offer to customers, or just withdraw this questionable service.",1,2013,02,16
115,Understated Luxury,"Stayed three nights for a conference.  The hotel is well appointed, unostentatious, and charming.  Great location for London visitors - walking distance to Oxford Street, Covent Garden, Soho.  Rooms are beautifully fitted out but not large. The hotel is relatively modest in size but very comfortable.  Staff members are friendly, courteous, and offer old school service with a smile. Yes, I'm talking about you, Kashif :) 

I only experienced one minor hiccup when a room service order failed to turn up within the promised 20 mins. However, when I called to check on progress, the staff offered a substantial discount on the meal to compensate for the delay.

I have no hesitation in recommending it to business travelers and tourists (particularly couples, rather than families) in London for a few days.",4,2013,02,14
115,Great centrally located hotel,"Just wanted to say we stayed at  this hotel for a London weekend.  It has an excellent location for the sightseeing in London  For the shoppers, Oxford and Regent Street is just minutes away on foot.  The hotel is decorated very stylishly throughout, the staff are extremely friendly and courteous.  The rooms are extremely comfortable.  The only slight problem we encountered was that when we turned off the air conditioning in our room, it gurgled at several intervals in the night, I am sure this a problem that can be easily rectified. This hasn't put us off though, we will be back for our next London weekend and look forward to the great and friendly service.",5,2013,02,13
115,A very good hotel with excellent service,"Stayed a weekend with my partner and I can recommend the hotel with pleasure! The hotels location is perfect for a London visit and the service is flawless!
The room wasn't very big but large enough for two persons and the the interior design tasteful! I will absolutely book this hotel for my next visit.",5,2013,02,13
115,Definately a good choice,"I spent 2 days for business in this hotel, it was very nice, excellent service, the room was just perfect.
Good location, close to a lot of theaters (i didn't know there were so many in such a small area) and a few minutes away by foot from Regent street, Carnaby,...
 All the members of the staff I was in contact with were always ""ready to help and answer"" with a special mention to Kashif  :-)",5,2013,02,13
115,Business trip,"Everyone who works at this hotel is truly in the business of hospitality. They seem to love their work, care personally about each of their guests, and are consumate professionals. I stay here on business trips- I came here first because of the location and pretty look of the hotel and rooms, and keep coming back because of the people that work here who make me feel at home, especially the concierge team. The food has been even better recently (try the soup, different every day!). Fast internet keeps me productive. The perfect boutique hotel.",5,2013,02,10
115,Great hotel with top notch service!,"Stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel for a weekend which included a We Will Rock You theatre package. Whilst not cheap ( it is  London after all) the Bloomsbury is one of the best hotels we've stayed in, all the staff went out if their way to make  us feel at home, the check in manageress was particularly charming.  We were lucky enough to be upgraded, our suite was modern but luxurious,  immaculately clean and the bed was heavenly.  I' m sure all the rooms would be of an equally high standard. The general areas, very much  in keeping with the period feel of this  Lutyens hotel, are comfortable with scented candles making for a heavenly atmosphere. Complimentary  bottled water, tea and coffee and newspapers are just another nice touch. We enjoyed a pre-theatre supper which was delicious and good value, even if not included in the theatre package. Breakfast was also good, freshly made juice of the day and the porridge is to die for, you can even opt to add a dash of Irish whiskey!  We would certainly stay at the Bloomsbury again, and  also intend to try other hotels in the small Doyle chain.",5,2013,02,10
115,"Food, drink & theatre weekend","Visiting for weekend and needed a hotel close to Palace theatre. We couldn't have picked a more pleasant and welcoming place. From concierge to reception, all staff were courteous and helpful. Our room was ideal and very nice indeed.

Plenty to choose from at breakfast, and all very tasty. The staff, again, all helpful in maintaining a very enjoyable experience for us

The ideal place for this type of west end break, and I think we would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,02,10
115,Excellent service!!,"Arrived London late Friday night due to delays at Heathrow. We had already booked a hotel at Russel Square. Decided quickly to book another hotel and fortunately there were available rooms at The Bloomsbury.
Friendly staff and very serviceminded. Special thanks to the ""concierges"" and staff at reception desk. High standard on rooms, bathroom and superb beds. In addition the hotel is located close to Tottenham Court Rd, Oxford Street, Soho and Covent Garden. Everything is within walking distance. Easy connection by taxi to either Paddington (Heathrow Express) or Victoria (Gatwick Express). Will recommend The Bloomsbury if you are looking for a quality hotel!
We will definately book it again for our next trip to London.

115,Overnight for Hotel and Theatre  - 50 metres apart,"Would have been 5 stars had we not been denied entry to our room by the room key failing (even after reception had re-set it!!). However, despite that this hotel does focus on providing allsorts of little things to make the 'big picture' excellent. As others have reported, the staff were excellent and the service was amazing, the rooms in the hotel were lovely and fairly large for London, also with the Nespresso coffee machines. Th included continental breakfast in the Landseer restaurant was a banquet and the Lutyens lounge was a great place to meet visitors for drinks when the bar wasn't open. The pre-theatre 2 (or 3) course meal in the Landseer British restaurant is good value, though only 3 choices on menu including 1 veggie for each course. We had specifically booked this hotel because of it's proximity to the Dominion Theatre on Tottenham Court Rd to reduce walking (mobility problems) and underground travel and our room overlooked the stage door and costume repair room!! I suspect that this hotel would be even nicer in the summer as it has a seated outdoor extension to the lounge and bar areas. Great value if you get a deal through Capital breaks or some similar organisation, otherwise the prices are definitely central London!!",4,2013,02,07
115,Weekend Away,"The staff were excellent and the service was amazing. Then the mussels, which I had for an evening meal, and the full English, for breakfast, was exquisite. Furthermore the rooms in the hotel were lovely and delightful then the bar area was a brilliant atmosphere especially when we were able to watch the rugby on Saturday afternoon.",5,2013,02,06
115,Beautiful Central Hotel,"We had a lovely weekend in the Bloomsbury Hotel, it was so central for the west end and within walking distance of lots of other attractions London Eye, westminster etc.  The staff from the doorman greeting you to the chamber maids were very welcoming and helpful.  The little added touches like candles lit through the hotel all added to the atmosphere we would definately go back again.  Thank you!",5,2013,02,06
115,Brilliant hotel with a great location.,"Brilliant hotel, great location close to Covent garden,Painless check in and out. Staff could not do enough for you. 
Excellent rooms with everything you need nice touch with the Nespresso coffee machines,Well worth a stay.",5,2013,02,06
115,Second visit and not disappointed!!!,"Having stayed here once before, We decided it a good option on our second trip to London. Luckily we were not disappointed as the high standards we received before had got better or were the same. The food is of a great standard, especially the evening meal we had. I asked reception if we could buy the bed when we left, so comfortable.

Really don't listen to the petty reviews from some reviewers, this is a great hotel. Much before than some of the bigger chains around in the area.",5,2013,02,06
115,What a find!,"Found myself in London for a week on business and didn't know where to stay.  Found a rate that suited and turned up at this hotel.  Day 2 and my initial impressions are only getting better ..... Staff very friendly from the doorman to the breakfast staff and nothing is too much trouble for them.  Good size room, clean, complimentary wifi great and look forward to beer and dinner in the restaurant night!  Keep up the good work!",5,2013,02,05
115,Bloomsbury Hotel Breakfast Is Excellent,"We would like in particular to praise the buffet breakfast at the Bloomsbury Hotel. Presided over by the delightful Maria, the atmosphere is extremely pleasant, the service excellent and the food plentiful, varied and delicious.",4,2013,02,05
115,central location,We stayed on saturday night after a night out in town. We booked the standard room which although small had enough space  for it to be comfortable. The room was clean with fluffy towels and bathrobes.The staff were very polite and helpful and we would stay here again.,5,2013,02,04
115,A little pricey for what you receive,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury for our honeymoon. We absolutely loved London. We found that the location was very good, maybe just a little off of where we spent most of our time. The hotel was nice and the people were friendly. We asked for an upgraded room and were willing to pay for it and were told since we used a travel site they could not accommodate this request. I found this odd as I have used numerous travel sites and travel frequently and never been told this to be the case. Our room was small but nice. Our view was awful it was just the interior of the hotel. We hoped that someone would care we were there on our honeymoon but no one seemed to. We are traveling back to London in October of 2013 and won't be staying here, it seemed as though a little customer service could go a long way. ",2,2013,02,03
115,"First choice for any stay in London, highly recommended","As someone who stays here on a regular basis, the staff are consistently friendly, welcoming and always happy to go the extra mile to help - the excellent Gunilla and Mohammed both lead the front of house teams and ensure it is always a pleasurable stay. The location is ideal and a 5 minute walk of Soho, Covent Garden and on the doorstep of Oxford Street. The breakfasts are amongst the best I've eaten anywhere and would kick any 5 star hotel offering into touch. The rooms are spacious and finished to a very high standard. Highly recommended for business or leisure and the concierge team are also experts in advising on where to go, see and eat in the area. Superb value for such a central London hotel.",5,2013,02,02
115,English class,Great hotel with a friendly staff. Safe neighborhood and a short walk to the British Museum. Not sure if we got lucky but our room was pretty big and there are heated marble floors in the bathroom! Beautifully decorated room with a huge comfy bed. The hotel was very clean and everyone there was happy to answer questions or give suggestions. No complaints about this place!,5,2013,02,02
115,Ok hotel,"Great location.....easy to get to and from, great for the theatre, great for shopping, would recommend purely for location, unfortunately this hotel was not for me, more of a personal opinion,I stayed with family and although the hotel has character, I just didn't appreciate the corporate feel to the hotel, when away for a few days I want to leave feeling completely pampered and relaxed, unfortunately I cannot say that I did, staff didn't really go out if their way to look after us, despite 2 night stay, no one seemed to recognise us, all in this is an ok hotel, but could be much better.",2,2013,02,01
115,Lots of charm,"I stayed here for four days on Business in January but would happily use it for vacation too. The hotel has nice character, It is stylish but feels inviting and warm.  For example - it had Heated bathroom floors and has a small but wonderful library/study ... they also use it as a small meeting room. Great service, Knowledgeable staff and nice amenities. The room comes with complementary tea and biscuits as well as sparkling and still water. And of course there is coffee too. 

It is also within walking distance of good restaurants and bars as well as theaters, It is also easy to get taxis to and from the hotel. The hotel restaurant is also pretty good. Another really nice thing about this hotel is that even though it is close to so many things it is very quiet

Plenty of outlets to accommodate multiple Devices and power cord types.",5,2013,01,30
115,Great stay in a well equipped friendly hotel,"I'm an MD of a London company owned by a large multi national. I have used the Bloomsbury several times through december, and most recently in January, to look after visiting international staff. All i can say is that the organisation has been excellent , the welcome warm and friendly and the attention to detail as good as in any top class hotel i've stayed in . The rooms are a very good size for London and are beautifully appointed with free wifi , nesspresso coffee makers and ipad/i phone docks.

All my visitors have been suitably impressed .

The location, right in the centre of everything, also makes this hotel a must!",5,2013,01,29
115,Superb,"Wonderfull hotel, service was second to none, room was inviting, comfortable, contemperary and lots of little extra's i.e nice bottles of toiletries nespresso coffee maker, ironing board and iron, selection of herbal and fruit teas etc and to top it off chocoltes on your pillow when you returned after dinner. Food was excellent, well presented and good value and a very exstencive range for breakfast. We will be staying again. A lovely end to a very enjoyable show at the theatre.",5,2013,01,28
115,A wonderful weekend stay!,"We had a wonderful time at this very well situated, beautifully appointed hotel. Have stayed several times before both for pleasure and business - mostly business- and have always been very impressed by the hotel and especially the service. The staff are a delight! So caring. Great breakfast - no, not cheap but relaxed, with plenty of choice and much more than we could eat! Lovely lounge area - great for enjoying a glass of champagne after the theatre.
We did move rooms at 1am because our room overlooking the covered atrium space was so noisy from we think, the main air conditioning/ heating units down below? Manager was very polite and helpful. We moved to a much quieter but smaller room - we had paid for a superior. A bit disappointed not to be offered any recompense for this, hence the 4 stars not 5. That said, we had a brilliant weekend overall.",4,2013,01,27
115,Bloomsbury is a real gem,"We stayed here as a 40th surprise weekend for my wife. We were upgraded for free to a suite which was amazing. 40 mins after getting into our room we were given a free bottle of proscetto. What more can I say?  The service was excellent, the location was perfect for Leicester sq and soho and only a short walk to some of the major sights

The food was terrific and a quick 5 min walk down Oxford street gets you to STEFs Italian which was amazingly good food for a very good price. 

All in all we had a fantastic stay at the Bloomsbury and would definitely recommend a visit. We will be coming back.",5,2013,01,27
115,Good but not great,"I chose the Bloomsbury Hotel for a weekend extension to a business trip in London. I wanted something with super convenient location to central London and good quality accommodation at a reasonable price. In my opinion the Bloomsbury offers good value given what it provides at its price point and the rooms were clean and pleasantly appointed. Personally, I'd prefer a hotel with a bit more signature character and atmosphere, though the hotel is definitely nice -- it's more traditional than my individual tastes and feels more like a business hotel. It definitely doesn't scream romantic getaway.

My only real issue with my stay is that I deliberately left the Do Not Disturb sign on the door when I left for the day and I came back to find that Housekeeping had come into my room and cleaned, moving all my belongings in the process. I had never experienced this before where the DND sign wasn't honored. Moreover, when I reported this occurrence to the front desk, the woman I spoke to politely listened but took no real interest in my level of concern. Disappointing, perhaps an isolated incident but could have been handled better.",4,2013,01,25
115,Sumptious!,"Nicely appointed hotel. Spotlessly clean.Extremely helpful and friendly staff. Great location, ideal for the centre of London. Perfect location for theatreland. Will definitely be back and will be recommending to our friends and family. ",5,2013,01,25
115,Knowledgable service with a smile!!,"Last minute booking, nothing planned! It didn't matter, this hotel is in a great location, close to several attractions, day and night. Lovely room and just the right amount of attention. The local knowledge by the concierge team meant we never put a foot wrong, some of of those lads must be around a long time, they know London like the back of their hand!!
Excellent stay, highly recommended",4,2013,01,24
115,Never Drops its Standards,"Always top notch. Stayed here a few times and everyone FIRST CLASS. How do they get such GREAT staff????

Malaka in the bar/restaurant is such an ambassador for this hotel you could be mistaken by thinking it was his,  even the doorman Kashif makes you feel so welcome. Nothing is a problem here. The best hotel I've stayed at. Only one small gripe is that I thought the shower a bit weak on pressure and means you take longer to wash. 

Havig said that I'll be back in a few weeks.",5,2013,01,23
115,First Class Hotel,"The Bloomsbury in Gt Russell Street is one of if not the best hotel that i have had the privilege to stay in
The Location is fab for shopping in Oxford Street and for the Theatre's and Cinema's in town and are all within easy walking distance
I was only staying for 2 nights but the hotel was so nice i stayed an extra 2 nights, my 6 yr old daughter was going to stay with me but as it was snowing so bad she couldn't make it but on arrival i was made really welcome and when i got to my room they had made up an extra bed for her and they had left a little gift of a teddy bear for her as well
The room was a lovely size, clean and well maintained and the bed was really comfortable
I had a couple of little problems but they were sorted out before i blinked
oh and i must say all the staff at the hotel are really lovely and will make your stay amazing
I must finish buy saying that i stay in London Hotels nearly every weekend and have stayed in every 5 star hotel in London and this was one of my most comfortable stays, This is not a party hotel like the Mayfair or the Sanderson, this is just a lovely hotel with lovely rooms and lovely staff :-)",5,2013,01,22
115,Top hotel!,"What a great experience! From the porters who first greet you,the receptionists,waiting staff and housekeeping,all are very friendly,helpful and professional. The reception is a great area to sit in and admire the decor together with the smell of fresh flowers.Our room, a superior kingsize was excellent and so quiet. Very well appointed and clean. Breakfast was a very unrushed affair with great food. We will definitely be coming again!",5,2013,01,21
115,Perfect base for central london,"I stayed here as a single traveller in December. Very much a boutique hotel and the attention to detail is obvious. From the porter who goes out of his way to offer help, the smell as you walk into the lobby, flowers, little extras. 

I had a standard room and it was small - I couldn't have had two people staying in here or much luggage. But absolutely fine for one and I took the advice from this website and requested a quiet room at the back of the hotel. 

It's a short walk (less than 5mins) to tottenham court tube and Oxford street for the shops/ Charlotte st and soho for the restaurants and bars 

With such a friendly and indulgent feel, I will definitely choose to stay here again when I travel to London. ",5,2013,01,18
115,Total luxury,"I keep wanting to go back to this place even though I really can't afford it! There's something very special about it. The reception area alone is so stunning, with beautiful furniture, fresh flowers, and scented candles everywhere.

The rooms themselves are just as elegant and stylish. I suppose you could say they're a bit on the small side but you get that a lot with big London hotels and I don't mind it at all because they're so comfortable. The bathrooms are dead nice too; heated under the floor, big fluffy dressing gowns and hot, powerful showers.

The Tube is really close and loads of stuff is just a short walk away, including the West End.

The service is great- first time we went we had a couple of issues with a broken tap and faulty air conditioning, but the staff found us a new room to sleep in. We were a bit surprised that they didn't help us move our things, but it was 2am and I think we were all a bit tired & not thinking straight. And we were offered a free stay to make up for it :)

Another time I went with a friend who had special food requirements which had to be taken into account when ordering room service, but nothing was too much trouble for the staff. They're lovely!

Usually I just use hotels as a place to sleep & the place I'm visiting is the main attraction. However this hotel is a big attraction and I have been back purely to stay in this hotel! I definitely recommend it.",5,2013,01,15
115,Perfect stay in the heart of London,"Everything was perfect about this hotel. The service was right on, the building was charming and felt both historic and modern at the same time, and the location couldn't be beat. It's two blocks from the heart of Oxford Street and a short walk to everything in Soho, Covent Garden, and Mayfair. Oh, and at night, they light candles and lanterns in the entrance and hallway that smell amazing. Really added to the welcoming experience of coming back to your hotel after a night on the town.",5,2013,01,14
115,Wonderful Hotel in a beautiful Area,"I actually traveled here in August 2010, but that was before I used Trip Advisor...I came across it on here, and wanted to review it. 

I stayed here for a night in London before going up north to Manchester for a friend's wedding. I wanted to do a bit of sight-seeing. Upon arrival (I was very early..way before check in...) the front desk was awesome because although I was too early, they offered to take my luggage so that I could go sight-seeing for the day. 

All of the staff here was very friendly and went to great lengths to be sure their guests were content.

The food was excellent. I would definitely recommend the breakfast tarts and tea on the terrace at any point in the day as a nice relaxing snack. 

The rooms were absolutely gorgeous! 

The next time I am in London, I will definitely be staying here!!!!",5,2013,01,13
115,"""A perfect girlie weekend!""","This was my second stay at The Bloomsbury, and yet again it was perfect in every way! From the minute you walk up the front steps you are treated as if you are the most important guest to arrive that day. The staff have perfected a fine balance of being attentive and friendly without being over bearing and too in your space. Nothing seems like too much trouble for them. 
The Bloomsbury Hotel is beautifully decorated with particular sensitivity paid to the splendour of the Lutyens design whilst seamlessly providing all modern conveniences too. 
My bedroom was luxurious, again wonderfully decorated with everything I needed and more. It was equipped with so many thoughtful and high quality extras that make you feel truly pampered. My bed was perfect, so unbelievable comfortable and coupled with the fact that it is SO quiet for central London, I slept like a log!
My friends and I met in the stunning bar for drinks where again we were so well looked after by the kind and thoughtful staff who made sure we had everything we needed before we went off to the theatre.
Breakfast the next morning was like being a child in a sweet shop, it was all delicious and you wanted a bit of everything! It was hard to choose. The staff were incredibly patient with our group as we all wanted something completely different,  but despite this all six dishes arrived at exactly the same time so we could eat together. They really do cater for every taste! 
I can't recommend The Bloomsbury Hotel highly enough. It is ideally located in Central London but you feel once you there you could be in the middle of the country, it is so peaceful and relaxing. The staff are wonderful and go out of their way to make your stay perfect in every way  they can. Thank you for a wonderful girlie weekend!",5,2013,01,13
115,A thoroughly pampered weekend!,"Stepping inside the front door, I was immediately enveloped in the sumptuous and relaxing aromas of the reception area. The bedroom was equally luxurious, with every need catered for, and a bathroom with heated floor, high quality fittings and a range of thoughtful complimentary toiletries. Heaven!
The bar area is welcoming and relaxing and the attentive and friendly staff meant that my friend's 50 the birthday celebrations got off to a wonderful start. This was mirrored in the morning in the restaurant where the breakfast staff were equally welcoming and the breakfast available was delicious. At no point were we made to feel rushed and boy could we natter!
The Bloomsbury has managed to achieve 5 star luxury with all the attentive service that one would expect but maintain a friendly, welcoming ambience. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,01,12
115,Top-notch hotel,"I had a fantastic experience at the Bloomsbury... it really was just wonderful all around. I arrived incredibly early and they were able to get me checked in early without a moment's hesitation. The hotel itself is lovely, and smells delicious (there are some beautiful candles going seemingly 24/7). I stayed in a deluxe queen room and it was well-appointed (especially the bathroom!). Most importantly, however, is that the bed was very comfortable and the hotel is QUIET. I got an amazing night's sleep each night I was there. The Bloomsbury in a fantastic location (30 seconds from Tottenham Court stop on the Tube and an incredibly short walk to the British Museum). Free WiFi, and an excellent restaurant as well.

This will be my home base the next time I am in London (and the time after that, and so on!).",5,2013,01,10
115,Recommended,"We stayed in a Superior Queen room. no 424 which overlooks Grt Russell st.
FOR
A perfect bed! 
Very quiet location, for such a busy area the street has little use and with the double glazing and curtains we had a great sleep. Nearly a miracle in London! No noise from other guests either.
Lovely linens.
We liked the decor.
Room and bathroom spotless and everything finished to a very high standard indeed.
Nespresso machine was a real treat. (and made very good coffee!)
Robes, slippers and wash products all very luxurious.
Powerful and hot shower.
Lounge very warm and comfortable with free coffee, water and papers.
Early dinner excellent and a good price too. Excellent service.
Nice staff.
A really lovely stay.
Against
Well the room is a bit cramped and the bathroom just about the smallest we have ever seen!!
Do the  interior designers ever stay in the rooms they design?  The furniture is too big and badly placed in this room. Ok perhaps for a single occupant but for two people it needs a serious re-think and a ruthless clear out.  If you are bigger than a size 10 (my wife) or more than a medium size man i think you would struggle!!",5,2013,01,10
115,"Sumptuous hotel, great experience","The Bloomsbury is a beautiful hotel.  The reception area is designed and furnished quite classically while comfortable and welcoming.  Staff are very attentive.  Our room was perfect, comfortable and spacious and with every facility from multiple shower heads to iPod dock.  The pre-theatre dinner was attractive and well priced.    Post-theatre drinks in the bar were a bit more expensive than I'd expected.",5,2013,01,10
115,Only one gripe with this fabulous hotel,"Stayed one night to catch a show. Excellent attentive service without being overbearing & the overall decor is clean, smart & rather delightful. Now lets get the gripe out the way. I am a wheelchair user & the only disabled access is around the corner of the main entrance. The lift is awkward & impossible to use as a single traveller. I was told the lift was new by the friendly concierge staff & why oh why it wasn't better planned is beyond me? We also were unable to get anyone to come to the disabled access entrance when we came back from our night out. Fortunately I had my crutches & was able to climb the few steps at the front. I do wonder how those unable to walk would deal with this issue?

The room was what you expect from central London. It was small, however there was plenty of space to move around in my wheelchair. We arrived early & the room wasn't ready, but an hour later after a pint around the corner all was sorted. There was a well appointed bathroom with the usual toiletries on offer. The sink was a little low for my standard wheelchair. We had a wonderfully comfortable bed & we slept like babies until we forced ourselves up for breakfast. The food itself was first class & as we had read a previous review saying the service was slow, we ordered our cooked breakfast quickly. We needn't have worried as the service was swift & friendly even though the restaurant was heaving. 

Loved our stay & would consider staying here again. In fact we are already on the verge of doing so. The disabled access is the only issue. It is manageable, but I want to be treated exactly as any able bodied person. That's difficult when I cannot get out of the hotel without help!",4,2013,01,07
115,A great welcome and we'll appointed,"A first class welcome and we'll appointed room. Little things, like proper coat hangers, decent coffee and a warm flannel, make for a very pleasant stay. Only stayed for one night, but would definitely stay again, no problem with an early check in and a 30 second walk from Tottenham Court tube station, if you get your bearings right.",5,2013,01,05
115,Loved It!,"Staff: First point that must be made - superb! Friendly, helpful, and make you feel like they are genuinely happy you are there to stay. Loved the doorman, concierge, receptionists and breakfast waitresses.

Room: A little on the small side but loved how it was furnished - modern, looked new and well-kept. Bed was a proper kingsize and not just two doubles pushed together which sadly seems to be becoming the norm nowadays. Pillows and duvet were super comfy. Slept extremely well and was even sad about not having enough time to just relax and lounge around in the room!

Bathroom: Very clean, except that our little sink was clogged. This was raised as we were checking out and the receptionist apologised and said it would be looked into. She was sincere and we were happy as it was such a minor problem.

Breakfast: Excellent, quality spread with a hot option. 15 pounds well spent.

Wi-Fi: Major score for me here. Free, fast and with great signal even in our room that was tucked away in a corner.",5,2013,01,04
115,Nice but not great,"We stayed for New Years eve to watch the fireworks.
The hotel and staff were nice but we had a couple of irritating issues.
The TV kept going into standby mode according to the maintenance guy which meant the remote
control would not work so we had to stretch behind the TV unit to switch it off at the mains while holding the on button in continuously on the front. This happened every time we wanted to use it and seemed to be quite a common problem.
Also, the sink wouldn't drain away, luckily it was partially resolved by the same maintenance man while he was in the room fixing the Tv!
We were on the 6th floor so the room was quite small as it was partly in the roof but that was ok apart from the bedside table & lamp were oversized for the room and were touching the slanted ceiling so we had to pull it away from the bed side to make some room.
On the positive side the room was spotlessly clean, well appointed & quiet",3,2013,01,03
115,Most helpful and friendly staff,"We spent just one night at the hotel, but were treated with the greatest respect by all staff. The receptionists, restaurant staff and concierges were cheerful, helpful and friendly without being informal. The room was very clean and well equipped. The location of course is superb, so close to The British Museum, Oxford Street and so on.",5,2013,01,03
115,Best Hotel In London!!!!,"I just can't say enough about this wonderful property. I visited London from the US for a very short trip in December and from the moment my taxi drew up to The Bloomsbury Hotel I felt like royalty. I was greeted warmly by a doorman who swiftly brought both me and my bag up the steps and into one of the most inviting hotel lobby's I have ever seen. The seasonal decorations and fresh flowers were out of this world, and the plush furnishings and wonderful scent (I'm guessing very expensive scented candles) that filled the lobby were exquisite. I loved the cosy and welcoming feeling, especially after a long trip! The front desk agent was friendly and efficient, hitting all the key check in points and anticipating my every need! Even better, my room was ready and waiting for me, despite the early hour of my arrival. My room was located on the 4th floor and was meticulously clean, luxurious and very well appointed (Nespresso machine, sony docking station so no phonecharger needed, free wireless internet access etc). Someone has clearly taken great care to ensure every possible aspect of a guests needs are covered in these rooms. From the high quality linens to the very upscale bath products, I couldn't have been happier! I enjoyed a wonderful nap in the extremely comfortable king size bed before meeting my friends for a Christmas lunch in Covent Garden (a short walk from the hotel), never once being disturbed by noise from elevators, housekeeping staff or other guests using the hallways, as is often the case when trying to catch up on sleep in the daytime in may other hotels. I enjoyed a drink in the intimate but upscale Landseer Bar, a perfect spot for enjoying a pre theatre cocktail or dinner from what I experienced! Every single encounter I had with the staff at this hotel was a great experience. Each one was happy to help me with whatever request I had and did so with genuine kindness and grace (this has not always been my experience when traveling in London). The bellman/doorman on my departure (I believe his name was Gary) even walked my luggage down Great Russell St to my friends waiting car, totally above and beyond!  

All in all my stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel could only be described as first class. I travel frequently and have stayed in numerous upscale hotels throughout the world, The Bloomsbury Hotel is a true gem, and the only place I will stay on my visits to London.",5,2013,01,02
115,my place to stay in Bloomsbury,"I enjoyed this hotel. Great ambience, perfect location, just around the corner from the tube station. Also some restaurants and grocery all within walking distance. Room was very nice, didnt feel very small and love the grand staircase. I will continue to book it for future trips.",4,2013,01,01
115,Good place to stay in the center,"It's a very nice hotel in an older building, but the inside seems to have been recently renovated so the rooms are quite modern, mid-sized and clean.

Breakfast was pretty good value for this kind of hotel at 15 pounds per person. It is a very adult breakfast (no chocolate cereal!), it is good quality food and the porridge and berries was very nice.

The only problems we had were that the sink did not drain very well, and the shower is not tall enough if you are 6'4""!

Otherwise a great place to stay, close to everything in the center (no need for the tube, just walk - although it's only 2 mins away).",4,2012,12,31
115,The best hotel in Bloomsbury,"If you can get a deal, or if someone else is paying ;-) I would highly recommend this hotel for business and pleasure.

I've stayed in 7 or 8 hotels in the Bloomsbury area over the years but this is the only one I've been compelled to review due to the quality of the staff, rooms and restaurant - all first class.

On a business trip, three of us were upgraded to individual suites which were huge, very well appointed with Nespresso machine, walk in wardrobe, drench shower and TV at the end of the bath (which I've never really understood.... nice touch though!!) 

The hotel is on a quiet street but perfectly located for business in and around the area. The foyer is lovely with attentive staff, complementary drinks and snacks as well as good seating areas for informal meetings.

It's a great find, one I wish I had discovered many years ago! Look forward to returning to this place.",5,2012,12,31
115,Relaxing in a great London location.,"The Bloomsbury Hotel on Great Russel Street is ideally located for easy access to tube stations and to the attractions of Oxford Street.  The welcome we received was incredibly warm from the moment we arrived at the front door.  The hotel is a stunning Georgian building with grand but unassuming frontage. The staff are very helpful and provide a great service with a smile.  We also had the breakfast which was lovely and with a wide choice to chose from.  The hotel interior is plush and luxurious without feeling overstated.  We had a fantastic and spacious room with plenty of storage and a huge comfortable bed. I can't fault this hotel.  We were reliably informed that the Bloomsbury is in the top 25 business hotels in Europe.  With the excellent and friendly service, I can see why.  I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again.     ",5,2012,12,30
115,a first class hidden gem in central london,"On a recent trip to London for a concert we stayed at the Bloomsury Hotel, very central for all transport facilities and within walking distance to entertainment i.e. theatres, cinemas and museums [the British Museum is in the same street]. The room was more than adequate for our needs with good facilities, the staff efficient, helpful and friendly. Breakfast menu was excellent with good choices at reasonable price. Try it and enjoy it.",5,2012,12,30
115,"Great hotel, rooms a bit on the ""cosy"" side","We stayed at the Bloomsbury in November for a long weekend.   Very comfortable property, fantastic location.   One complaint -- room was a tad cramped.   This a great location in London, so I get it.  But there really was no usable closet space.  If we'd been there for business or for a longer time that would have been a problem.  (I assume the higher room categories have more room.)   In any event, everything else was great.  Staff was nice & helpful, very quiet.   We'd definitely stay there again.",4,2012,12,29
115,Mediocre at Best,"I stayed recently at The Blomsbury for a short business trip in November. It wasn't a particularly great experience and I did not feel I received good value for my pounds. Although I found the location to be convenient and quiet, the hotel itself is very dated, with public areas looking old and stale with very bland decor. The restaurant and bar are in the basement and feel accordingly dark. The lobby is unattractive by any measure. My room was very small and dark with a view looking into a wall.  Service was not bad and they tried hard, but minor annoyances  marred my visit. Twice my in room safe failed and I had  to call for help which took over 30 minutes to fix.  
In short, I can't recommend this hotel.",3,2012,12,25
115,Fabulous location,"Lovely hotel, we were in a suite to accommodate our 10yr old with us and the room was lovely. Location brilliant to tube, to shopping, to theatres and connecting to airport expresses. Great for dining and nightlife in greek street so close. A few issues with service in the hotel restaurant and breakfast restaurant and getting the sugar refilled in room with nespresso machine. Worth another try we think.   ",4,2012,12,24
115,Luxury that is reasonably priced :),"Ideal location for anyway in central London.
Friendly & helpful staff
Luxurious hotel 
Warm & comfortable
Beautifully clean

Quick to check in & out-was able to check in 2 hours early. 
Would reccommend and will be staying here again!!",5,2012,12,23
115,Lovely & elegant hotel - price within reason,"This hotel was really charming. The lobby area is chic, warm and open. Staff are all very lovely and accomodating. The size of the room was alright but maybe on the smaller end of things (not spacious but decent). The room was modern and up to date where needed to be - bathroom and technology (tv, ipod dock). The location of the hotel is great and it's really worth splurging a little extra per night to be in this kind of location. 5 mins from Soho, 5 mins from covent garden, 5 mins from oxfird circus and 1 min from the tube station. Love it and would go back!",5,2012,12,21
115,Lovely place for first London stay,"I recently got back from a wonderful first time trip to England.  We stayed at The Bloomsbury Hotel for a week.  We had a great stay there! 

In planning this trip, it took some researching to figure out what area to stay in while in London, since the city is so large.  My son was studying there for a semester, so I looked for something that would be in the area of his school.  It was a great choice - we ended up having what felt like a central location.  Of course, I checked Tripadvisor and from the information there/here settled on The Bloomsbury Hotel as my first choice.  I contacted the deputy general manager before I booked to see if it was possible to stay there and have two beds - everything I saw online indicated only one bed per room.  I was traveling with my sister and had no desire to sleep in the same bed with her!  The deputy general manager was very helpful as we emailed back and forth - she answering my various questions and letting me know that they could give us an unzipped king room.  I booked a deluxe room and thought we were all set. 

The lobby and reception staff were consistently welcoming and helpful.  Our room (502) was nicely appointed, but very small.  We had one king bed which did not appear to have been separated other than the beds being sheeted separately.  I went back down to reception and they sent someone up to take a look at our non-separate bed problem.  Unfortunately, the person they sent up did not understand why we had a problem with the way the bed(s) were.  She kept saying they were two beds, even though there was no space between them.  We put her out of her misery and took care of it ourselves.  The two twin beds that made up the king were on wheels, so we moved them as far apart as we could given the space in the room.  That night we ordered room service, which was very nice and we slept soundly.  The hotel is very quiet. 

The next morning I talked with reception again.  They had said we could take a look at a suite and decide if we would like to move rooms.  We were happy enough with our room - as I mentioned, it was quiet and although very small, was certainly workable and very nice - but thought we should take a look at the suite and see what the difference would be.  And, oh!, what a difference!  The suite (room 414) was wonderful!  There was so much more space.  There was a small hallway where the wardrobe was, then the bed area, desk/tv area, sitting area and very large bathroom with claw foot tub, separate shower, separate toilet room, and double sinks!  How could we not move rooms, when we could have this lovely space for the same cost as our deluxe room?!  We changed rooms and when asked, we said they didn't need to hurry to get the bed unzipped.  The staff is very responsive though, and there was a harried housekeeping person ready to switch the king bed to two twins almost as soon as we got to our room!  She made up the beds and after she left, we once again separated them as far as we could, moving the nightstands in between the beds for more space.  Ultimately, I was so happy that we were able to switch to a suite!  Not only was it so much better to have the additional room (and the double sinks for two women to get ready!), it was really nice to have the two comfy chairs and ottoman, etc. because we ended most of our nights hanging out in our room with my children watching tv/movies, having drinks and appetizers.  This would not have been comfortable in our original room. 

A continental breakfast had been included with our stay.  They would seat you at a table, ask what you would like to have to drink and ask if you wanted white or brown toast.  Then you helped yourself to things like different cereals, mushy cereals - oatmeals and porridge, a few fruit choices, yogurt, meats and cheeses, pastries.  My sister loved the roasted red peppers.  We were always served six half slices of toast - even when I said I only wanted one.  I hated to see that waste everyday.  Our last night there I found out we could have our free breakfast as room service and only pay the delivery fee of 4 GBP (and tip).  That helped us out our last morning when we knew we wouldn't have enough time to go down to the restaurant for breakfast.  I wish I had known this earlier. 

Housekeeping:  someone else here had written about the overzealous housekeeping staff and I agree.  On the one hand, it was nice.  As I mentioned earlier, they were very quick to respond to our issues about the bed situation in both rooms and in the second room, the lighted mirror fell apart in my hand when I moved it and someone came up right away and fixed it.  On the other hand, it was irritating to have someone knock at the door every night asking if we wanted turn down service and one day we were so off schedule, they actually called us to see if they could service our room.  I feel like it would be our own fault if we didn't get out of our room in a timely manner and because of this our room wasn't serviced.  I wish there was a system to request no service.  Just give me some extra towels and glasses and I'm good.  I don't want to feel like I'm inconveniencing the housekeeping staff.  Also, there was one day my sister stayed in the room and the cleaning staff person was down on her hands and knees cleaning the bathroom floor, but I could tell the sink counter hadn't been cleaned.  I think she was rattled by someone staying in the room like that - so much so, that she forgot her key card for the lights.  We also found things (a pound coin, a pill) when we moved the beds and a pair of rolled up socks when we moved the chairs, which left you wondering how well the carpeted areas had been cleaned. 

The lights/power outlet situation:  I wish someone had told us more about the lights when we first checked in.  We got to our room and maybe we just didn't understand, but the lights go out if you don't leave your key card in a little slot for this near the door.  I can appreciate this as a energy saving measure.  It would help to have a little instruction note at the key card slot for this.  Also, as much as they are trying to save energy, there didn't seem to be a way to turn off banks of the recessed lights - it was all or nothing.  There were no power outlets in the bathroom.  The bathroom had good lighting and yet you couldn't fix your hair in there.  There is one outlet and I had to ask someone what it was for - apparently it is for a shaver.  If you want to use the hairdryer supplied or use your own hair drying/curling/straightening appliance, you have to do it by the desk where there is a nice big mirror, but the lighting isn't nearly as good as it is in the bathroom.  They did have a row of outlets and I appreciated that one of the outlets was a USA one.  We also had a iphone/ipod/ipad charger on the desk, which was helpful. 

Overall, we had a very nice, quiet, comfortable experience at The Bloomsbury Hotel.  I recommend it to others.  I thought the location was ideal.  As others have said, the Tottenham Court Road tube station - under remodeling in October - is not far at all.  There is a small convenience store very close to the hotel where you can get things like water, juice, snacks, magazines, postcards (and stamps) with a post box right outside of it.  There is a Sainsbury's not too far up Tottenham Court Road that we went to frequently.  When you first go in the store, there is a lot of to go type food and as you move farther in there is small sections of beer/wine/liquor, produce, dairy, and so on.  The British Museum is close by, there are many pubs, sandwich shops and other restaurants in the area - or a tube trip away.",5,2012,12,20
115,Top Class Bloomsbury,My wife and I recently spent a couple of days in London in early December. We chose the Doyle Group The Bloomsbury Hotel based on our experience of staying at their sister hotel The River Lee Hotel in Cork City Ireland which was excellent. On arrival we were greeted with a welcoming drink and warm towels to freshen up. The check-in was quick without any hassle. The very nice receptionist a girl from France called Louise allocated us a lovely room which was terrific with excellent decor and a huge comfortable bed. Tea and coffee making facilities were provided with complimentary bottled drinking water and biscuits which were replenished daily. The breakfast buffet was really top class and the service was impeccable. The concierge Brian was tremendously helpful and patient as were all the staff. The hotel is in a quiet street just around the corner from Oxford Street and the main shopping centres. It is also close to the Theatre district. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to potential travellers.,5,2012,12,20
115,Excellent hotel,"Stayed last Sunday night. 
Location excellent. Three minutes from tube. Ten minutes walk to Oxford street.
Fab room. Spotless. Had dinner which was very nice and quiet reasonable. Breakfast is a must. Extensive menu
Freshly cooked. 
The staff were exemplary at the Bloomsbury. Thanks to all and hope to see you again soon. ",5,2012,12,20
115,One of the best in London,This is the first time that I have stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel - having stayed many times in London - and only did so because it was a last minute booking. What a great surprise. The rooms are as good as you will find anywhere - not just London. The bedroom is gloriously well laid out and the bed is to die for - so comfortable. The bathroom is quite spacious and the toiletries are high class - and a shower that actually covers you in water!! Check in was easy and the people at Reception genuinely friendly - which makes a change for London!! It is easy to get to from Tottenham Court Road and only a short walk to Covent Garden. The bar downstairs has a real unique feel and the service was outstanding. We actually went to breakfast outside of the hotel and turning left as you leave - there are two really nice places to get a full English breakfast - just for a change from the hotel. If you want anywhere to stay in London this is the place to go to - and also reasonably priced.,5,2012,12,19
115,Delighted,"This was booked for my son and his girlfriend. I called the hotel to let them know it was his 21st birthday, they could not have been more receptive. They had a beautiful room and very kindly the manager left a note with a bottle of complimentary fizz for them to enjoy. Great location for them to enjoy the sights and a little RT.
I am impressed by the care and attention that was offered to them. Would definitely book this hotel again.
The only negative was the room was too warm so the air con was on, this was noisy and interfered with a good nights sleep.",5,2012,12,19
115,Outstanding!  A Very Special Place,"I trawled the internet looking for somewhere special to take my partner as he has had a very poor year health wise.  I found the Bloomsbury and was impressed with the photos and reviews.  I was however still worried having booked that i had made the right choice wanting everything to be perfect.   I contacted the hotel before my visit and received outstanding customer service, something that is all too lacking in today's society!  That conversation i had with Beccy Gunn cleared any doubts i had about making the right choice. She is a tremendous ambassador for the hotel.
The visit itself was perfect in every way.  The decor of the hotel, for our taste was perfect.  The scent of mulled wine and Lily of the Valley enhanced the ambiance of the lobby.  The mulled wine and mince pies were delicious!  All of the staff we encountered were immaculately turned out and extremely polite and courteous, always greeting us with a warm smile.  The surprise of an upgrade to a suite was very much appreciated, as was the bottle of wine and cakes, thank you to Beccy &  Mikel Alvarez.  The suite was beautiful, immaculately clean, beautifully decorated, in fact perfect in every way!  Loved our breakfast, I'm sorry i don't know the ladies name who booked us in but she was a joy and put a smile on our faces! I also really appreciated Beccy seeking us out at breakfast to ensure we were happy.  We most certainly were and i am so grateful for the hotel going above and beyond in helping my trip to London be everything i wanted it to be for my partner.  We have and will recommend this hotel to everyone and can't wait to return some day soon.  I have and will continue to recommend this hotel to everyone!  Memories that will never be forgotten!",5,2012,12,18
115,One of My Favorites - Now My London Go To,"Spent 2 nights at the Bloomsbury when I was in London for my former bosses 40th.  What an amazing place.  Extremely well located, its only about 3 minutes walk from the Tottenham Court Road tube station and about 10 minutes walk from Covent Garden.  My girlfriend got in the morning and before me, so she had to wait a bit for a room, but they got one set up as quickly as possible and the extremely comfortable lobby made it easy.  I'm a platinum member with Omni, which is in the GHA with Doyle Collection who own the Bloomsbury, and wasn't really recognized as such on check-in.  However, they did bring up a very nice greeting card and some minced pies. 

The bar is very nice, especially the extremely nice and knowledgeable staff.  I'm used to having to spell out how to make my favorite drink, but the bartender knew it as soon as I opened my mouth and did an amazing job.  

One of my absolute favorites - up there with the Canary in Santa Barbara and the Omni in L.A.",5,2012,12,17
115,great location,We have just stayed at the Bloomsbury hotel and to say it was very comfortable with nice fittings and very clean room. The location is great to see the places of interst.The bathroom was nice but on the small side. I would recomend this hotel to anyone.,4,2012,12,17
115,Central and quiet area,"I think this is a typical, a bit above average, hotel in London. The service is good but the nights maybe a bit expencive. I booked this by phone and was informed the rate was 105£, but it turned out to be 175£ when I got the confirmation by e-mail. Also note that the price does not include breakfast, nor VAT. With three beers in the bar and no breakfast, I ended up with a payment of 236£ for a night. 

The rooms are quite small (including the bathroom).  Room are equipped with a bathrobe and accessories. The minibar did not work so all beverages was room temperatur. Quite soft mattresses.

The location is great for shopping and points of interests, but as said, a bit expencive.",4,2012,12,17
115,Special Treatment,"My wife and I have just returned from a wonderful stay at The Bloomsbury to celebrate my wife's birthday.  I feel I must send an accolade of the highest order to the staff and management for the wonderful service we received during our stay.  The hotel is beautiful and ornate, spotlessly clean with super and attentive staff.  Location could not be better, especially as we were seeing ""We will Rock You"" at The Dominion, which is literally just around the corner.  The show was fantastic.  A special thank you to Mikel Alvarez for the wonderful champagne that awaited us in our room. Breakfast was outstanding, checkout swift and friendly.  This hotel gets the Big Thumbs Up and next time in London would not hesitate to book again.",5,2012,12,16
115,The best hotel in Central London!,"I have stayed in The Bloomsbury at least 10 times in the last 12 months. Every time I am amazed by the excellent service they offer. All the staff members are extremely helpful and courteous, and they will make their best effort to make your stay comfortable.

I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who is traveling on business or pleasure.

Keep up the great job!",5,2012,12,16
115,"A Gem of a hotel; wonderful location, complete comfort, tasteful decor and the friendliest welcome...","Having just stayed at the Bloomsbury in December I wanted to leave a review to thank the team the Bloomsbury for making all my visits this year perfect. Also to let anyone considering staying at a hotel in the Westend on business or leisure to put the Bloomsbury at the top of your list. 
I stay in so many hotels on business around the world but always look forward to staying at the Bloomsbury. It's setback in a quiet street just by Oxford street, the best of location for shopping and theatre but quiet enough not to be disturbed by traffic. The decor is tasteful, a mix of boutique hotel touches but on a grander scale and the rooms really are immaculate, soft duckfown pillows and fresh Egyptian cotton sheets. One of the biggest draws to return is the staff, they  really do make you feel genuinely welcome, from Brian the Head concierge to Estellia at breakfast and mikel the duty manager. I think the GHA loyalty scheme is a nice touch... Room upgrades and gifts of theatre tickets or other local experiences if you stay regularily. 
I stayed this month on leisure which was a novelty for me and took advantage of the Christmas package the Bloomsbury has on offer... The lobby looks wonderful with a huge spruce tree traditionally decorated, Mulled wine and mince pies offered at check in, late check out, breakfast and festive turn down. I definitely recommend the Eggs Benedict. If you are a tourist comming to London at Christmastime I'd say the Bloomsbury would make the perfect base and give you a real taste of a Traditional British Christmas but with contemporary comfort. 
I look forward to my next visit...",5,2012,12,15
115,Great hotel,"Have just stayed overnight at The Bloomsbury and can honestly say, it has cheered me that you can still find old fashioned courtesy, politness and professionalism in a major city hotel.
From Louise on reception to Estelita in the restaurant the staff were excellent.
Hotel is welcoming, rooms are great and kitted out to a very high standard.
I will definitely stay again and have promised my wife she can come next time.
Great hotel and great team.
and no I do not work for them or have any relations who work for the hotel.

115,"Nice staff & great location, calming atmosphere","ı stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and can say that the rooms are very clean, the staff are very helpful. Its located only couple of steps away from the british museum and to the other facilities. Breakfast was also nice with lots of alternatives, they were offering complimentary beverages on the lobby as it was christmas period i guess, but it seemed very elegant thought.
Enjoyed my stay a lot and definitly can advise it to everyone.",4,2012,12,14
115,"Good location, staff outstanding","Good location, easy location to get out and about around London.  Staff were outstanding throughout my stay, nothing was too much trouble for them.  Reception staff cheerful and helpful, food outlets serving good food and friendly, housekeeping keep the hotel looking in top shape.  Staff went out of their way to make my stay that bit more comfortable.  Great hotel for business, everything a finger tip away.  Will be back.",4,2012,12,13
115,Good hotel for business,"Couple of niggledies like a loose tile int he bathroom and not enough soundproofing against late night revellers. However, nice room and reception. Good location near Tottenham Court Roaf. Fast service at reception. Part of gHA but I don't know what that is.  Great soap and lotion collections. ",5,2012,12,12
115,Good not perfect and very expensive,"Nice hotel in a convenient situation.
I stayed for one night for a business 
It was all dressed up for Christmas and smelt lovely .The food in the restaurant was very good .
The room was almost £250 for one person for one night this only included a continental breakfast !
It was allegedly a superior room but was small it would have been hard to get to the far side of the bed it was so cramped and full of furniture and it was noisy being adjacent to the lift and just general hotel noise running water etc.
However the bed was really comfy and the room a nice temperature .If I had booked this room and paid for it myself I would have been very disappointed for these sort of prices even in London I expect some treat value and that was lacking .
   
",4,2012,12,11
115,Centre of London,"Excellent location for shopping, arrived early morning dropped bags off before venturing forth into London.We only stayed for one night but two days round town so it was useful to be able to leave our bags. Reception area was welcoming with lovely sofas and a welcome coffee or tea available or hot mulled wine and mince pies. Staff friendly and helpful. The room was very comfortable and well equipped.  Breakfast was excellent and well worth paying for in advance.",5,2012,12,10
115,Fantastic location and lovely staff,"I stayed here for business and was impressed from the moment I stepped inside. The staff were incredibly welcoming and helpful. I was suffering from a nasty cold so the complimentary mulled wine in the lobby was greatly appreciated (purely for medicinal prurposes!). John who was serving in the lobby bar was wonderful, nothing was too much trouble for him and he was always smiling. There was another Jonathan in the bar downstairs who served us in the evening. Again, we has lovely and made us feel very welcome despite the late hour! Lovely cocktails...
As for the room, it was nicely decorated and incredibly relaxing. My only quibble's would be that the heated towel rail is awkwardly positioned over the loo, being quite short, I found it difficult to get my towel up there so hung it on the back of the door instead. Also, for some reason, I was unable to turn the room lights off and keep my bedside light on, I either had to have them all on or all off which wasn't ideal when I went to bed. Other than that, the room had everything I could possibly have wanted.
Breakfast was lovely, with a good choice on the menu if you were having the 'hot' option. I opted for the pancakes which were a bit dense but luckily I quite like pancakes to be stodgy but if you're expecting them to come out light and fluffy you'd be a bit disappointed.
Overall, a lovely stay and I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming for business or pleasure.",4,2012,12,10
115,Excellent location and good service,"Have just returned after a 3 night stay with my wife. We are both able bodied. We booked a superior room and were allocated room 319. The bathroom is kitted out for disabled guests (good point generally) which means the bathroom is a wet room for ease of access (good point again). Unfortunately, when you use the shower it is difficult to contain the water within a reasonable area (bad point).  There is also no view as the room looks into a small inner courtyard (bad point again - why should disabled people not have a view too?). However, what really killed this room was that there is some sort of air duct/vent that runs directly above the ceiling and it is very noisy.  We rang reception just before midnight and they sent someone up who told us it would eventually switch-off - it didn't, which made for a very sleepless night (very bad point).  On the other hand, by the time we went to reception the next morning we had already been allocated a new room (422) and were offered many apologies (but nothing else - even a complimentary glass of wine would have been appreciated ).  Our new room was much better (although even here there was another noise coming from something mechanical in the ceiling but which was less intrusive and only intermittent). Great Russell St is not in itself a pretty street but the overall location is excellent for West End theatres, shops and restaurants as well as accessing all that Marylebone, Camden etc have to offer.  Generally, everyone at the hotel was very polite. There is an elegant reception/foyer that exudes a real ""upmarket"" feel (as good as, for example, the Goring Hotel). Although there was a Christams party being held on Saturday night we heard nothing of it from our room.  Breakfast is not cheap (£15 for continental and £21 for English) but what you expect to pay in this location.  The rooms were clean and the beds comfortable.  Would I stay again?  Despite the problems I have described the answer is yes.  We may have just been a little unlucky but next time I will definitely not just make an internet booking but will also phone ahead and insist on not being allocated room 319.",4,2012,12,09
115,Good but not perfect,"The location is excellent and the rooms are nice.  The staff is usually helpful, but not always.  Thus, the sink in the bathroom was half clogged, but during the whole week of our stay nobody tried to fix it.  Apparently the cleaning lady did not bother to alert the maintenance about it. Also, the ""Reception Team"" is too quick in charging the dredit card given at check in, when your account rises to more than 750 pounds.
The breakfast is excellent.",4,2012,12,09
115,Blooming lovely staff,"This is a Lovely boutique hotel close to British museum and close to shops.    Great foyer area. 
Staff could not be more helpful and courteous.  Very good service. 
Rooms very comfortable.  Free wifi, and well equipped. 
I too found the Room service food a bit average but wasn't too bad. 
",4,2012,12,07
115,"Great staff, horrible food.","I stayed here on business for 5 nights.  My room was comfy and clean (love the big bathtubs) and the staff was exceptionally nice (if not stretched too thin). 

But I have to say that the room service was some of the worst food I've ever had at a decent hotel. I ordered dinner 3 different nights, each time assuming I was just not ordering the thing they would do well...if there is one I didn't discover it.  Even the steak was fairly repellent. 

Think this is a nice hotel for travelers on holiday who are getting out every night for dinner, but really frustrating if you want to tuck in and eat in your room after a long days working.",3,2012,12,05
115,With our thanks,"We stayed here for a family celebration for a weekend and had the most wonderful time.  The staff were so friendly and extremely helpful. Nothing was too much trouble and they made our stay very special. The rooms were clean and spacious.  Locations was superb.  We had the most fantastic meal. I would just like to give our thanks to the fantastic staff who helped us during our evening meal. Unfortunately one of our group fell ill and the staff couldn't have been more caring, accommodating and professional.  Thank you so much for everything you did for us, we are so grateful. We would without a doubt stay here again.",5,2012,12,04
115,on business,"I stayed at this  hotel for 1 night only. service was second to none , all the staff from cleaners to managers were exceptionally helpful and polite. they couldn't do enough for me and made my busy stay enjoyable. I will definitely stay there again. well done ",5,2012,11,29
115,fantastic hotel,we stayed at the bloomsbury hotel on 25/11/12 and were delighted with the room and the service the staff provided. we were particularly pleased with the service we received from the concierge for whom no request was too much trouble and who's knowledge of the area and recommendations were perfect.,5,2012,11,29
115,Excellent hotel,"I spent 3 nights in the hotel and it was wonderful. The rooms were very comfortable, good bathroom, and very friendly and helpful service. The price for the room might have been a little too high, but everything in London is expensive.
The location was superb. Tube is only 100 meters away. Covent garden and Soho in a 2 minute walk. Picadilli 10 blocks away....
I would definitely go back again and recommend it to a friend.",5,2012,11,27
115,Quality decor and service but perhaps a bit too atmospheric,"This hotel has worked hard at giving quality service - staff are very curteous and helpful - the hotel foyer is magestic and the room I had was beautifully decorated with quality furnishings. I did find the room too hot (even in November) and it was too dark - although atmospheric - I struggled to see what I was doing. It made the stay a little gloomy.

Otherwise a quality place and an enjoyable stay.

Breakfast was good but there are too many questions being asked - so early in the morning !!",4,2012,11,27
115,Fantastic weekend,"We recently stayed 2 nights at The Bloomsbury Hotel, location is superb for the West End, we  had a great time wandering around Covent Garden and Soho and shopping for furniture on Tottenham Court Road.
The room was great, spotlessly clean, modern and contemporary. The staff were really attentive and helpful. Breakfast was a real highlight, the buffet was comprehensive and there is also a hot menu to choose from.
We will be staying again! - can't wait for another excuse to go to London for the weekend and to stay at The Bloomsbury, reasonably priced too for London!",5,2012,11,25
115,Excellent hotel with friendly staff,Only stayed here for one night but had a lovely time. Hotel excellently located for central London. The room was spacious. Good sized bathroom with power shower and luxury toiletries.  Fab breakfast. The staff are this hote's best asset. Really friendly and helpful. Will definitely come back. Oh and Jonathan in the bar makes a fab martini!,5,2012,11,25
115,An exceptional place,"First, it's a great hotel, from all aspects.The location is right near the British Museum, Oxford st. and transportation. 
The rooms are clean, beds and bathroom are great.

breakfast is very rich and tasty.

But above all - we had a medicel emergancy while staying and the staff was exceptionally supportive, caring and encouraging.

Truely recommended",5,2012,11,25
115,Exceptional Service,"I have made over 120 trips to London on business over the last 20 years.
The Bloomsbury ranks second to none in customer service and facilities.
Rooms are impeccable and the facilities terrific.
I would highly recommend this hotel for the business or vacationing traveler.",5,2012,11,24
115,Excellent stay in a great hotel,"I and my wife stayed at the Bloomsbury hotel during my 50th anniversary weekend. We were upgraded to a better room and honored with a bottle of champagne. The Bloomsbury is a great looking old style hotel with great history and excellent service. The location could not be better and even though it is located in the heart of London we could not hear any traffic sound at all from our room. The breakfast is excellent and the bar is a cozy place to visit before going to the theater. This will definitely be our hotel during annual trips to London.
Orn Sigurdsson, Iceland.",5,2012,11,19
115,Average I guess,"I stayed for just one night on business.  I have spent a lot of tie in London over the last few years and I would just say it was another average London hotel. The location was great, handy to the Tube and New Oxford Street, it was an easy walk to Covent garden.  The room was small (by London standard it was ok) but the bathroom was very tight, you would not want to be big to fit in to the shower, which was in the tub. It was clean, the bed comfortable so really I’d sum it up as neither great not poor. I never tried the breakfast, it was expensive and I did not have the B&B package, plenty of spots outside to have a quick bite but they did have great coffee in the lobby so I will give them a plus for that. I would also have to give it to them for the free WiFi, it worked and worked very well so you get a plus here also. Ok so location good, bed comfortable, expensive (210 + tax) but I’d say just OK if you are visiting for a night.",3,2012,11,19
115,Very good location,"Spent 4 nights for business at the Bloomsbury Hotel. Another average 4-star London hotel, neither great not poor. On the positives: Very good location, just next to Tottenham Court Road station and a few minutes by cab from Covent Garden, the Strand, Oxford Street or London St Pancras station. The bed is fine and clean. Good eggs Benedict at breakfast. Free WiFi and newspaper including the Financial Times. On the less positives: Small room, no view, noisy room fridge, clogged sink in the bathroom (as reported in a previous comment - that is just unacceptable). The bar and breakfast room are located on the lower ground floor, meaning no window / natural light. Staff is OK (95% international, mostly from Eastern Europe), but not exceptional and not passionate: just doing what they need to do. I could have put 4 stars not 3, but at £250/night + tax, it deserves an average rating.",3,2012,11,17
115,A wonderful hotel,"Stayed here for a week in early November, and loved it. From the moment we stepped out of the cab we were greeted with a very friendly staff. Check-in was easy and flawless, and room 623 very welcoming. Plenty of room to put all belonging away, including suitcases, and a roll away if required. The bath and amenities are superb. Location can not be beat. We enjoyed champagne in our room prior to stepping out to watch the theater ... only steps away.  Shopping is also just minutes away in Covent Garden and Oxford Street. Can't wait to get back to London again and stay here.",5,2012,11,17
115,My return trip!,"I stayed here a second time exactly one year from my last visit. It's a great hotel! Excellent service, comfortable beds, breakfast included, fitness center and free wifi. Oh yeah and great value and location.

I very much enjoy my visits to the Bloomsbury and expect I will stay here again in the future.",4,2012,11,14
115,"I've stayed in a whole lot worse, for a whole lot more!","Having stayed here three times now I have to say its one of my favourite in the city! After a day of filming and travelling im always made to feel VERY welcome! From the reception staff to the maids everyone seems to smile as they pass!

Rooms each time have been clean, and big considering the location of a central London hotel. You are litrally a 2min walk to the subway, Dominion theatre and lots of places to eat and shop!

Every evening your also greeted with turn down service, newspaper and a Lily O'brien choc....seriously what more can you ask for. 
See you in a few weeks!!!!",5,2012,11,11
115,Should be a 5 star,"Lovely hotel, great location, very friendly and efficient staff. Will definitely stay there again! Very nice touch with the complementary tea, coffee and soft drinks in reception. Although the rooms
Are a little compact, the bed was lovely and comfortable.",5,2012,11,11
115,Quality service,"We stayed for three nights, the staff were always very obliging from the bell boys to cleaners. The room was clean and well stocked with all the necessities. The bathroom trolley needed a bit of TLC  but apart from that everything worked. The bar was pleasant to relax in and the bar staff very enthusiastic.",5,2012,11,09
115,The bar at the bloomsbury hotel,"After a really busy day with several meetings, running all around london, so angry because businesses were not doing well, i reached to the boomsbury's hotel  bar, wich is in the basement, is not to big but is really elegant and cozy, in the bar was Jonathan, who offered me a fruty and refreshing cocktail. through his entertaining conversation, made me laugh and helped me to forget about the bad day. 
i think is a nice and exlusive place to drink some good coktails in london that not to many people knows.",5,2012,11,07
115,LOVE the Bloomsbury,"me and my boyfriend stayed here in march after weeks of looking for the perfect hotel in london , we settled on the bloomsbury! we LOVED it! the decor is beautiful , the smell of the scented candles is amazing when you walk in.
All the staff we came across were lovely and polite. Great that you can leave your luggage at the hotel before check in as our train arrived very early into London.
The breakfast is fab we ordered room service a couple of times and it was very quick.
Great location for central london, oxford street, tube stations, covent garden ect!
loved it so much i am returning with my mum in 2 weeks! 

oh and the bedrooms and the bed wow, best nights sleep ever!",5,2012,11,07
115,Excellent service from start to finish,"My wife and I were struggling to book a room at one of our usual hotels and I tried The Bloomsbury Hotel at the 11th hour – I’m glad I did.  From the moment I contacted the hotel through to the time we checked out we were well looked after.  This was part of a ‘special weekend’ for us and it got off to an excellent start when booking in at reception and we were told that we’d been upgraded.  The room was excellent, very clean with all the facilities you’d expect.  We used room service, the Bar and the restaurant (for breakfast) and all were fault free.  The hotel was pivotal in our enjoyment of a lovely weekend and we will definitely use them again.  Final special thanks go to Beccy Gunn the Deputy General Manager who went out of her way to make our stay an enjoyable one.",5,2012,11,07
115,Terrific Hotel.,"We stayed here for a London break recently. The hotel was great. The reception staff were most welcoming as were the concierge and porters. Our room was fantastic with the highlight being the bathroom. We loved the location and ease of access. The bar is intimate and a lovely place to spend time after a show. The breakfast is second to none. We'll be back.

115,Pampered Start to Married Life!,"We had a great stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel albeit only two nights at the beginning of our Honeymoon.  Despite being close to very busy central London shopping streets the hotel was quiet and perfect for a peaceful, romantic stay. The staff were always attentive, polite , friendly and knowledgable but not intrusive.    We ate breakfast and an evening meal and were pleased with the choices and standard of food.  The decor throughout the hotel is beautiful (we didn't use the fitness facilities) and the beautiful, original staircase is so much better than the lift!  It is only a 5-10 minute walk to the British Museum which is well worth a visit and also close to several theatres.   We have already recommended The Bloomsbury Hotel to our friends and family.",5,2012,11,06
115,Keep Calm and Stay at the Bloomsbury,"Enjoyed this hotel for many reasons. Great beds, beautiful rooms, location to metro and other sights, and super helpful concierge.  You will like this hotel!
I would stay here again upon returning to London. Restful and relaxing rooms make this a must stay. ",5,2012,11,05
115,Excellent location,"The hotel is located in a central location, close to oxford street and British museum. Very good service in general! the staff is very helpful. However I had a noise issue in my room (strong noise coming from the AC unit during the night) they offered me another room and tried to fix the problem in a very professional manner. Other than that there is nothing to say and its a great value for price.",4,2012,11,05
115,Perfect,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is in a great location - near a tube station but in a quiet street. Handy for theatres and the London museum. 
All the staff we encountered were extremely polite.
The breakfasts were delicious with lots of choice in cooked dishes and also in the buffet. This was one of the best hotel breakfast experiences I have ever had.
The room and bed were comfortable.
I loved the smell of the scented floating candles in the corridor leading to lifts, that is a very nice touch. ",5,2012,11,05
115,Location is perfect!,"Stayed here for just one night and had a very enjoyable experience. The location is 2 minutes from Tottenham Court tube station, just off Tottenham Court road. It's an extremely handy location for central London with the main shopping areas on the door step.
The rooms were very clean and the staff were extremely friendly. I'd certainly consider staying here next time I'm in London",5,2012,11,05
115,Great location and service,"So many London hotels are so deferential they become unfriendly; the Bloomsbury was a real surprise, normal people on concierge, an Irish girl on reception, friendly folk in the cocktail bar and at breakfast, just the job. We'll be back!",5,2012,11,03
115,Home from Home..!!,"Their is a sporting saying.."" Form is Temporary.. Class is Pernament.."". The form is in relation to other hotel types in London , but to my wife & i.. the Class is definatly & the  Personification  of Class is the .. Bloomsbury hotel in Russell square.   The hotel interior is as the title states is very homely, the rooms , we stayed in a Superior room which is soothing & timeless, when you enter it,  you just automatically relax..!!.   The same applies for the resturant // bar // & breakfast. the food & beverages, tea ..cofee & beers are top class. The location is great, Est; walking distance to Oxford street..5 mins & within 10 mins you enter the Social Hub of .. Covent Garden..Leicster Square & Soho,with fab resturants & bars of all types . But allow me to conclude by advocating the Bloomsbury Hotel staff.

115,Doesn't feel like it costs the price tag,"Overall impression is that the hotel does not cost the price. No one is waiting for the guests, so u have to carry your luggage yourself up the large stairs. That's something u need after a long flight for sure. Rooms are big, but there is no character in decoration. Really, nothing special. Room service is mediocre, bar was lacking drinks they've advertised. 

Wifi is free across the whole hotel - that's a good thing. I will be certainly trying something else next time in London",3,2012,11,02
115,Perfect one-night getaway,"We spent our wedding night at the Bloomsbury hotel in 2011 and the combination of the great location, excellent service and comfortable rooms brought us back for our first night away from home after the birth of our son. Once again the Bloomsbury lived up to our expectations. This time we couldn't afford the brilliant suite we had on our wedding night but the room certainly lived up to the high standard you would expect for this price in London - sadly many others do not. We really appreciated the personal welcome from the staff. We had a great night out and a long comfortable lie-in. A rather decadent but well-deserved treat.",5,2012,11,02
115,comfortable stay in central location,"Staff were very professional friendly and helpful, Hotel is comfortable and well appointed. For position near the British museum, Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road you couldn't do better. 
We were upgraded and our room and bathroom were very nice, with bath and wet room style shower, also ironing board and iron, tea and coffee making, safe, alarm clock. In the morning complementary coffee and papers in the lounge.",5,2012,10,30
115,"The Bloomsbury Hotel, Great Russell Street, London","This hotel is just superb for both the tourist and business man.  The location is just excellent - right in the heart of the West End with The Dominion Theatre (We Will Rock You) just a 2 minutes walk away.  Not that you would know it. The rooms, particularly at the back of the hotel, are VERY quiet. They are well appointed to boot. The larger rooms are particularly well equipped, On one of our stays (I've stayed on a number of times) my family stayed on one room which had a TV over the bath!  We normally cannot get our son into the bath - here we couldn't get him out! The food is just excellent with a good choice for breakfast - something for all tastes. An indulgence - being able to read the daily papers over breakfast is just a great way to start the day. The staff are just great - very attentive. This hotel is very well run and managed. I have recommended this hotel to my immediate family and also to friends and my company. All who have stayed on my initial recommendation have not made any adverse comments. My sister stayed there just last weekend (60th birthday present) and I received text updates throughout her stay to say just how pleased she was with the hotel. My advice - try it. I would be VERY surprised if you will be disappointed. David.",5,2012,10,30
115,Excellent Hotel,"Have just returned from a wonderful stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel.  The staff were friendly, professional and went out of their way to help.  We were upgraded to a wonderful deluxe room, which was quiet, large and with the most comfortable large bed.  Breakfast was excellent, I am used to a buffet style, but here the cooked breakfast is made to order.  It was superb.  The location is excellent with a tube station within a couple of minutes walk.  Looking forward to staying again.  Would recommend without hesitation.",5,2012,10,29
115,A little bit of luxury just off Tottenham Court Road,"This hotel was just fantastic for what we wanted.
We needed to be near Park Lane for a swish black tie dinner at The Grosvenor and we wanted to make the most of a night away without the children.
Traditional good old fashioned service and surroundings, for not too bad a price when booked through Hotels.co
The room we had was small but luxuriously furnished, the bedding was to die for, with the most comfortable hotel bed I've experienced in a long time.
The equipment and facilities were also excellent, with an iPod speaker/charger, Nespesso coffee machine and every kind of connection and socket you could ever need.
Check in was friendly and efficient, and the front of house staff very courteous.
Sadly we didn't sample the restaurant, bar or breakfast facilities but the building is lovely. Would highly recommend",5,2012,10,29
115,"Great Location, Great rooms, Great service.. almost too much service","First time to London and had the pleasure of staying at the Bloomsbury Hotel for 5 nights. Business and pleasure trip combo.

Have to say the location for this hotel is PERFECT!  half a block from Tottenham Court Road tube station and steps off of Oxford Street, steps away from the British Museum, and moments away from Soho and Covent Garden.. the location is supreme.

The hotel is quite nice too. Very chic and attentive.  Almost too attentive.. I can open my own door, but the greeting was indeed nice.  I'm not a fru fru type of guy, so the door man was a bit much for my liking, but they were sweet so.. i let them open the door for me. haha.  

The room was great. good lighting options and plenty of space in the queen room.  Bed super comfortable and free waters/coffee etc and free wifi which worked very well.  Toilettries were great as was room service and turndown service. :)  the robes and slippers were super comfy.  Didnt appreciate that hot water took a while.. and frankly.. one morning didn't get any until the occupant of the room next to me stopped using the shower..  have to also say that if your neighbour is watching the tele at 3am, you will hear it.. especially if its loud.. otherwise though.. the hotel is super quiet and makes a great spot for a good restful sleep.

The TV remote was confusing.  Beds super comfy.  I would definitely stay here again.",4,2012,10,29
115,Large hotel that provides the care of a small one,"This was my fourth stay at the Bloomsbury and it will not be the last. The reception area manages to combine elegance with intimacy, a quality that extends to other areas of this smoothly-run operation. From the calm of the candle-lit ground floor corridor to the quality of decor in the rooms, the hotel exudes class. Nor are casual visitors overlooked: washrooms in the public areas are immaculate. Staff are friendly and helpful - there's real charm to the people on the desk - but maintain a quiet reserve and the whole impression is of staying in a boutique hotel. It is not cheap, one would hardly expect it to be, given the location and standard of finish. But having stayed in more expensive places, we would not trouble to look elsewhere for accommodation in London.",5,2012,10,28
115,Excellent Hotel,"The Doyle Collection continues to raise the bar in terms of quality and doing a wonderful ambassadorial job for the modern Irish hospitality industry. This hotel is one of the world's best. From the warm Irish welcome that greeted me at check-in, to the extremely well appointed rooms with wonderful bedding and amazing shower, I almost didn't want to venture out to work or to explore the wider charms of London.

My only cause for concern is the bar and restaurant aren't being used to showcase the other wonderful aspects of modern Ireland, like our winning cuisine, craft whiskies or beers, but there is plenty of time to add this to the portfolio.",5,2012,10,27
115,Superb!,"I travel extensively with work and am picky about the hotels I stay in. This was my first stay at the Bloomsbury and I loved it! 

The General Manager and her staff provided me with exemplary service. This is one of the very few hotels I have stayed at this year where the staff remembered my name!  The combination of extreme professionalism, helpfulness and quality left me with a very strong impression of this hotel. The quality of the room was extremely high, even by London's high standards. 

The location of the hotel was excellent and is suitable for both business and leisure. 

I highly recommend you giving this hotel a try. You will not be disappointed!",5,2012,10,26
115,The best hotel ever!,"We loved our room so much, we never left it! We had a suite which gave us a living room, gorgeous bed and enormous bathroom (with fabukous free-standing bath facing a TV set into the wall). The food was lovely so we ordered room service for both dinner and breakfast and we only left when it was time to check out!",5,2012,10,26
115,One night stay in the Bloomsbury.,Really nice hotel but the rooms are tiny. The hotel isn't cheap but it's nice and quiet. We decided to treat ourselves to breakfast room service. It was quite expensive and was without tea or coffee. The hotel is very central and near the British Museum. Don't think we will be back as we didn't find good value for money.,3,2012,10,26
115,Home from Home,"I frequently stay at this wonderful hotel as it is an 'oasis of style and calm' yet just a few steps from the West End. The public rooms are elegant and the restaurant a great place to eat where one is served by welcoming and attentive staff; I also find the lobby bar to be a great place to relax. The rooms are large, nicely furnished and with very comfortable beds.

A home from home in Central London.",5,2012,10,25
115,Lovely hotel in a great location,We truly enjoyed our stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel.  The staff is fantastic and the rooms are very well appointed with very nice bathrooms and lots of nice touches.  It is close to the tube and within a short walking distance of tons of wonderful restaurants and theaters.  The bed was very comfortable and the rooms were quiet.  We would highly recommend the Bloomsbury.,5,2012,10,25
115,Oustanding Hotel,"As a frequent visitor to London and having read the reviews on here I decided to spend the weekend in this hotel and I was not dissapointed. The hotel is perfectly located, close to all attractions, shows, tours etc.
The hotel itself is beautiful decorated with a very luxurious feel which is carried throughout the hotel and into the rooms. Our room offered plenty of space and the bed was extremely comfortable. Overall it was very relaxing
On our first night we decided to dine in the restaurant as we were seeing a show close by. We enjoyed delicious cocktails in the bar (Tthe Mojito is a must!!) 
We then had the pleasure of an absoloutely amazing and delicious tasty experience in the restaurant. The food was beautiful presented, tasted wonderful and the staff were very attentive without being obtrusive.
The star of the show though in this hotel are its people. From the moment we stepped out of our taxi we were warmly welcomed by Gary, we were then met with smiling faces in reception and also in the bar and restaurant. 
The concierge team were super in recommendating shows, restaurants and bars. We were very impressed to also see them in the rain run to the end of the street in the rain to get us taxis.
Overall this hotel is a complete gem which offers luxurious surroundings with excellent service. 
Thank you for a wonderful experience and we will definitely be back and will definitely recomment the Bloomsbury hotel.",5,2012,10,25
115,Outstanding!,"We have stayed at this hotel a number of years ago and were very satisfied with our visit, however - the upgraded interiors and luxury we found on this recent visit were outstanding.  A beautiful retreat from the busy city streets which was a truly pleasurable and relaxing experience.  As someone who stays in a lot of hotels - this has become one of my favourites with the little and simple touches that made me and my partner feel more than just 'guests'.  We could not fault a single thing from beautiful rooms, to comfortable beds and the best hotel breakfast out there - hot, fresh and excellent quality.  The service and courteousy offered by the staff is first class.  We have also stayed at the Doyle Collection's Bristol hotel - which is excellent also - where we were so impressed we had our civil partnership there.  We are now even bigger fans of this hotel chain - and would like to thank the Bloomsbury for a most magnificent stay.",5,2012,10,22
115,Perfect in every way,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury to celebrate our Silver Wedding and it was perfect in every way. The staff were very attentive and couldn't do enough for us. The room had a large and very comfortable bed and all the amenities you could wish for. Breakfast was first class and it was useful that it was served until 10am. 

The location of the Bloomsbury is excellent and within walking distance of the theatres, Oxford Street and the British Museum.

We would certainly recommend this hotel for a luxury break.",5,2012,10,22
115,Blooming Marvellous Bloomsbury,"I am just back from an amazing stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel. Having never written a review before for trip advisor, I feel compelled to say what a wonderful experience it was. The staff are perfectly attentive and genuine in their approach. The standard deluxe room was fantastic with plenty of space and a comfortable bed. The late breakfast until 11.30 and the Leisurely London package which meant a checkout of 3pm, meant a truely relaxing stay.
Thank you so much. I will definitely be returning.",5,2012,10,20
115,A good London base,"The hotel has character, it is well placed for central London attractions, the West End and is very near to the British Museum. It was an easy walk from Euston even with a small case. The food at both lunch and dinner was good and the service was appropriate. It is an old building with plenty of discrete spaces, our conference dinner was in the library which really was a library. Hope to revisit when not on business.",4,2012,10,20
115,Luxury Worth The Price,"We only had the pleasure for one night of staying at this beautiful Hotel with great facilities and great central London location. This was complemented by the friendliness of the staff in particular the charming young Head Concierge ""Brian"". Excellent rooms & if its a good nights sleep your looking for after a hectic or relaxing day you'll certainly find it here.... the darkness of the room with the blackout curtains & the peacefulness within the room was particularly memorable for my Husband and I.
We didn't have the chance to dine in the restaurant as we had dinner booked elsewhere, but if the breakfast was anything to go by we missed out on an excellent meal.
Lovely cocktails were served & enjoyed in the Landseer Bar.

Overall excellent value for the money paid & a small price to pay for the luxury enjoyed. Were looking forward to returning & staying on our next trip to London.

Lisa Keane",5,2012,10,15
115,Excellent - not cheap but worth it,I stayed for 3 nights in this excellent hotel - a stones throw from Tottenham Ct Road tube and The British Museum. The building is beautiful with much evidence in the public areas of its architectural history. Lovely comfortable quiet room with a soft bed  and fine linen. iPod dock Nespresso machine mineral water and other little touches such as umbrellas in the room made my deluxe room feel just that. Excellent friendly staff (those in the bar made great cocktails) . Breakfast a little on the pricey side so I opted for the little cafe over the road - good Italian coffee and bacon sandwiches! The South Indain restaurant over the road serves excellent dosas if you like that style of food (which I do). Will definitely stay again if I am visiting the West End which is a relatively short walk away.,5,2012,10,14
115,Luxurious,"A lovely room, very comfortable with the nice touches such as an iPad dock and a great shower.  The continental breakfast had plenty of choice of meats, cereal, bread and fruit.  The only small niggles were check-in being slow, a mix-up with left luggage, and being disturbed twice while still in the room by housekeeping coming in, the second time with a Do Not Disturb sign outside.  There are several steps to enter so we tried the level access round the side, which didn't seem to connect anywhere.  With all these niggles, it still deserves a four star as the room is just so great.",4,2012,10,12
115,A perfecy match quality-price,"my first stay and defintely not the last! Great decor, excellent assistance, perfect staff. I was particularly struck by the efficiency at the check in and check out, surely the fastest I ever experienced.",5,2012,10,11
115,Great rooms and good location,"First of all Bloomsbury is in my opinion the best area to stay in London. It is convenient for everything including the West End, Covent Garden, the Embankment and a huge number of other attractions but still relatively peaceful. The Bloomsbury Hotel is itself just a two minute walk to the British Museum and has been the subject of a recent refurbishment which really shows in the rooms and public areas.

I booked a superior room on the 4th Floor which was spacious and extremely well equipped with quality furnishings and fittings. The bathroom although small was beautifully finished and had underfloor heating. Everywhere you look in this hotel you will see the original woodwork and glass a treat for those interested in design and architecture.

The check in service and staff are on the whole very welcoming, friendly and efficient. There is someone on hand to help with luggage and taxi reservations and the concierge was helpful with directions, restaurant bookings etc. The bar in the foyer area is lovely and the service there also very good. It is a lovely venue for afternoon tea.

So why not excellent? Breakfast was included in the room rate that I got. The breakfast room, main bar and restaurant are all on the lower ground floor and although a lot of money has been spent on these areas it still feels a bit dark and soulless. What little natural light might be available is effectively ruined by the shutters. 

Breakfast itself is an area where the hotel really needs to think again. The cold buffet is fine-plenty to choose from and mostly very good quality. The cooked options are made to order which would be okay if they could do this to a good standard in a reasonable amount of time. On none of my three visits was the breakfast area particularly busy but service of a cooked option took at least twenty minutes. On our last morning after 20 minutes the waitress informed me that they had run out of my order-waffles?- I declined to order anything else mainly because of time. After  a further 10 minutes my Mother's scrambled egg and smoked salmon had still not arrived and we left as we had a taxi to catch. If the breakfast area had been busy I would have understood this but there could not have been more than half a dozen tables in at the time. 

In summary this is a very good hotel in a great area but if you are a stickler for breakfast then you might be better off at one of the Radissons along the road.",4,2012,10,11
115,We coundn't fault it,"It was our first time to the Bloomsbury ,a friend had recommend it to us ,so pleased she did .
From the moment we arrived the service didn't stop coming ,but discreet .
our room was well appointed, comfortable bed ,plenty of towels,nespresso coffee machine in the rooms fresh milk instantly available.
Nice touch was on return from our evening out, our clothes had been tided and the bathroom fully serviced as well as the bed turned back .
The breakfast buffet; I could not think of one more ingredient /item that was not on offer it was internationally caterered for and beautifully presented",5,2012,10,08
115,THE STAFF AWFUL,we booked to stay at this hotel for an eveing when we arrived we were tolod by Mr Mohammed Zain that our booking was in complete even though i had all my paper work confirming this to be untrue he told us that there were no rooms available even though at the time of booking there were and that we were to go to the Marylebone hotel which is the sister hotel he was not interested in the fact that i had confirmation of our booking and refused to help in anyway we then had to pay for a cab to the Marylebone hotel he did not tell us the address so then my husband had to go back in to get the address when my husband entered Mr Mohammed Zain was on the telephone to Marylebone hotel informing them of our arrival please now go to the Marylebone hotel for review of what came next!,1,2012,10,08
115,Good room but too much drama,"A good, corporate hotel with clean facilities and brisk, efficient desk staff. Hotel room attendants are excellent. When our air-con wasn't working (and the desk had been notified some time before), a staff member appeared for the turn-down service and offered to get a small heater, which was gratefully received. 
The big problem was the domestic argument at midnight in the room next door that involved shouting, screaming and eventually the police. My partner and I were pretty shaken by this. It's not something you'd expect from a hotel of this calibre. We had called the desk at the height of the screaming so management must have been aware of the distress of others in nearby rooms. The next morning, I thought that when I mentioned it to the staff, I would be directed to the manager to get a kind word acknowledging my ordeal. But no. Nothing. Just a 'Yes, we heard about that' and a 'I'll tell the manager.' Well, we told three different staff members over three successive mornings, each time to be promised that the manager would get back to us. The manager didn't. Not one word or even a cup of tea from anyone in charge. I know that they aren't responsible for the domestic but it happened in their hotel and as my partner and I were visiting London for a long-overdue holiday, we thought it was pretty poor form that nothing was said. This incident marred an otherwise great holiday in beautiful London.",3,2012,10,08
115,Lovely staff and hotel,"Booked a basic room for a one night stay.The room was lovely,with a very comfy bed and everything you need.The toiletries were aromatherapy associates so I had a hard time getting out of the bath as the oils were gorgeous.Its a great location for everything no need for taxis.The staff were the best thing.Everyone was very helpful and friendly especially the lady at breakfast who was in charge.I felt as if my mum was fussing over me it was great.We had the self serve breakfast lots of fresh fruit,bakery items and cold meats an excellent selection.Will Definitely stay here again but will try not to trip up the bedroom step more than once",5,2012,10,01
115,Bloomin Fantastic!!,"I stayed here recently after a bad experience a couple of months ago as I was offered a complimentary night as a result. All I can say is how wonderful it was this time round, I was offered an upgraded suite and it was simply gorgeous. The room was absolutely fantastic, huge with the most comfortable bed and the bathroom was extraordinary! Breakfast was delicious too. I am very impressed with how they dealt with a complaint - they followed up with me promptly and professionally. They really made a huge effort to turn a bad experience into a positive one and I will definitely stay here again.",5,2012,09,30
115,Birthday Treat,"Stayed here as was within walking distance to War Horse showing at New London Theatre. Was very pleasantly surprised, from reception area (all comfy welcoming couches, homemade lemonade and fresh water out in jugs) and welcoming front desk staff, to being upgraded immediately to massive suite with enough water and toiletries for 8 people, to quality of bed linen, comfortable beds, quietness of hotel for central london location and all of this for £156 through a last minute.com booking! We loved it. Good power shower and separate bath in room. We didn't have breakfast there as this was a Monday night stay and we had to catch train back to work in am so cannot comment on dining facilities at all, but for a one night stopover, to see a show - was perfect.",5,2012,09,28
115,Very surprised at the rave reviews,"This hotel is pretty corporate; I am sure that as a conference venue it's just fine. But for a romantic night in the capital there are much better options. Our 6th floor Suite was large and the king sized bed was ultra-comfortable. But the room was somewhat soul-less. Breakfast was poor. No personal touches. dreadful tea and coffee - why do hotels almost never get this tight? Smoked haddock had a nasty after-taste which lingered for hours. It's not cheap, so I had hoped for better.",3,2012,09,27
115,Luxurious relaxation,Myself and my daughter are just back from a 3 night stay in this beautiful relaxing hotel ! But the most Beautifull thing was the wonderful staff ! We arrived on Friday without our luggage as it was lost in transit ! They could not have been more nice . The concierge staff seen that we were so upset told us we could have a complimentary afternoon tea on the Sunday ! The continental breakfast was superb ! I did not want to leave this tranquil place in the heart of London ! Thank you Bloomsbury !!,5,2012,09,26
115,Great hotel!,"A very good hotel in every aspect. We will definitely return here in our next trip to london. Big and confortable room, nice downstairs bar, two blocks from a tube station, very clean and helpful staff. ",4,2012,09,25
115,"Perfect Hotel, Perfect Location.","I stayed at The Bloomsbury Hotel in mid-July of 2012. I loved it. The hotel is in a perfect location, just a minute walk from the famous Oxford Street. It was perfect for me because first I was traveling alone and second I could walk everywhere and I went to London for their shopping experience. 
The staff was very polite, their concierge was very helpful, the breakfast was good too and the room was very clean and comfortable. I will go back again for sure. 
I must add, I went to London just a few days before the Olympics and the prices were very affordable considering that fact. I enjoyed London so much and it's mostly because of the Hotel.",5,2012,09,24
115,recommed hotel,"the hotel is in excellent location.close to metro,british museum,oxford street,chaina town,etc.the stuff is polite and helpful.breakfast is good.clean room.at first we got small room and we did not like it,so in the next day they changed to a larger room.the hotel is well decorated.recommended",4,2012,09,20
115,"Nice hotel, great location","The Bloomsbury is well positioned for quick trips to all of the London sites and shopping.  The hotel itself is charming and warm.  I always seek out clean and comfortable rooms, which the Bloomsbury offered.  The staff was relatively helpful and friendly.  I would stay here again when visiting and definitely recommend it to others.",4,2012,09,19
115,Celebratory weekend,Had an excellent stay at the Bloomsbury hotel. Booked tickets for 'We Will Rock You' and needed a place to stay. Couldn't have picked a better hotel. Perfect location with staff who can't do enough to help you. Can't wait to go back.,5,2012,09,18
115,Third time and even better than the last,"This was our third trip to the hotel and as always the staff were really friendly and helpful,  particularly the concierge.  The rooms are comfortable, clean and well equipped, I would recommend asking for a room overlooking Great Russell Street, not the greatest view but a bonus to have natural light.  On our last visit we had a room that looked into an internal courtyard which wasn't very attractive and quite gloomy. (This still didn't spoil our trip)  The hotel is within walking distance of so many places to visit, British Museum,  theatreland, Covent Garden and Oxford Street to name but a few.  I recommend the bar which is really relaxed and cosy.  The food is reasonably priced and on this visit we enjoyed a sirloin steak, chips, tomato and mushroom and glass of wine for less than £30 for the two of us in the bar.  The chips were to die for.  Last night we ate in the restaurant and the food was first class.  We are already planning our next visit.",5,2012,09,17
115,Twice in two weeks and both excellent,"My work often takes me to London, and in the past two weeks I have found myself at two events in this hotel. One a formal meeting in a conference room, the other a rather delicious BBQ on an open-air terrace. On both occasions I was struck by the warmth of welcome, the efficiency of the staff and the comforts on offer. The hotel is a bit of a Tardis. From the street you would never know the treasures inside. The Library and Chapel function rooms are truly atmospheric. The BBQ area is probably seasonal, but the food was delicious. The bar area downstairs got a fair twist of business too ! Overall, I was impressed and am very happy to recommend this hotel to anyone traveling for pleasure or business. Just off Oxford Street and within minutes of theatreland theres a lot on the doorstep, although we hardly went out.",5,2012,09,15
115,Second time and still great!,"Our return to The Bloomsbury Hotel didn't start off very well. We decided to go back (this time with my mother and brother, so we booked two rooms) because the area where the hotel is located is great, the staff were great and we had enjoyed the experience. This time, the person at check-in seemed a little lost - which was understandable since it was indicated she was a trainee. Once we were given our rooms, we noticed there was a continuous leak coming from the room above ours right into our toilet seat. We immediately informed reception who promised to send someone to take care of it. Since we had things to do, we informed them we would enjoy the city and check the status once we returned. Since the problem could not be solved in time, we were moved to another room - bigger and nicer, by the way! - and Mohamed Zain, the  person in charge, gave us all complimentary drink cards to choose from the hotel bar area (which we didn't have a chance to visit last time and is really nice, cozy and offers a good variety of drinks to choose from). We were very satisfied with the way they handled the situation. The rest, as always, very nice: great location, friendly staff, vibrating area, comfortable and clean rooms... The minor, for me, continues to be the shower: no matter how one places the glass flap door, it always seems to splash more water than needed on the floor. Still, next time we are headed to London, I know we will be happy to be back here!",5,2012,09,14
115,WHAT A GREAT HOTEL,"Our daughter is studying in London so we took her and stayed for 9 days at the Bloomsbury.  I was so worried about the hotel being small or a/c not working adequately.  Wow....was I surprised.  This hotel is modern, clean & luxurious! A/C was amazing and I like a cold room & I had to turn a/c temp up a few nights due to how cold it got. My husband and I had an amazing 9 days at the hotel.  Beccy and the staff are wonderful.  We are already planning our return trip to London and another stay at this amazing hotel. Great location...easy walk to tube,Starbucks,British Museum, buses, Boots & grocery store.",5,2012,09,13
115,superb quality and service !,"We were booked into this hotel by my friend along with a party of 30 of us , for a birthday celebration . From the moment we arrived we were greeted by welcoming staff who directed to our rooms for the overnight stay . The rooms were spotlessly clean and comfortable any amenities needed for a business trip are catered for eg wireless connection , laundry services . wake up call etc ; We did not have the evening meal as we were there to attend a party but the breakfast the next day was lovely .A continental with every thing set out buffet style . I can throughly recommend the croissants . A cooked breakfast is available at an extra cost we didnt feel the need for one but a couple in our party had some and it looked delicious . there is a lounge area to sit with a mid morning coffee but we sat on the terrace mainly a large group of us as the weather was very good and the staff are only too happy to serve you out there also .All in all a wonderful stay .",5,2012,09,11
115,Central London Gem,"Tucked away off a side street off Oxford street you will find this Gem of a hotel.  I booked this hotel at short notice due to my regular hotel being fully occupied, and I am so glad it was.  At the time of my visit at the end of August it offered me a great price for central London. Although I am sure these prices will change depending on season.

What was great about the hotel was the 5 star staff service I received from this advertised 4 star hotel. The Location is superb and ideal for any first time visitors to London. All the famous sights are in reasonable walking distance and while you explore you will pass so many great bars and restaurants.  The area you are in means you are surrounded by all the best West End theatres with so many popular shows to choose from.

The room I stayed in was great, clean, tidy and actually  larger than I expected. It had free relatively fast Wi Fi free internet.  For the tired and those who have just traveled far there is a nice little restaurant and great little bar in the basement level.  The breakfast was superb and catered for those wanting traditional english breakfast or intercontinental light breakfasts. The catering staff were superb.  The front desk crew and concierge were also more than helpful and offered additional advice and help to any questions I had. If they cant answer immediately, they will get back to you.

The only slight downsides were for any fitness enthusiasts who want to attempt to stay trim whilst gorging on London delights, is that the gym is quite limited and not in the best of spaces. There is no pool either.  The entrance to the hotel is straight off the street up some stairs, therefore those of you who require assistance please ensure you phone ahead to the hotel or go inside and the staff will assist you happily.  However, these two points are heavily outweighed by all the positive sides to this hotel.  LOCATION, GREAT STAFF, ROOM COMFORT = EXCELLENT",5,2012,09,08
115,"Outstanding customer service, luxurious room","I would like to express my gratitude to the Bloomsbury hotel, for making our 10th wedding anniversary such a special time. As we were attending a matinee show, we needed to get ready, and although our room wasnt ready, the receptionist offered us a twin room which she assured would be switched to a double bed whilst we were out at the show. She also very kindly upgraded us to a deluxe room. She was so helpful, the service was truly exceptional. 
The room, was devine, very luxurious, comfortable bed, dressing gowns, slippers, lovely shower. 
After arriving back from the show, they had, as promised made the bed into a double, and also had very kindly left us a bottle of moet champagne, chilling in an ice bucket. This really topped off our stay. Would recommend this hotel to anyone. It is a super location for west end shows and covent garden. Right next to Tottenham court rd tube, and next to We will Rock you show.

Well Done, to all the staff, we shall definitely return.",5,2012,09,07
115,An Ideal Weekend Base in London,The politeness and standard of Customer Service throughout the hotel was first class. We must have met 40+ members of staff during our weekend stay and there was not one that fell below the very high standard set by the first person we met --- the doorman and then the receptionist. Outstanding service and there was always someone on hand too. Our Executive Room was very quiet and smokefree and gave us plenty of space to spend time in - unlike our room last year in the Strand Palace Hotel which was really small!  - Breakfast was not included in the price of the room - which was a pity but it was still good value for money at £15 all inclusive - £25 would have been too much!. It was a pity that all eating establishments were on the LOWER Ground Floor which made them a bit airless and there was no view of course. The food was excellent! Next time we must have Dinner in the Hotel . Finding our room (415) was a bit of a rabbit warren and again rather airless and claustrophobic. The aromatic candles were a lovely idea in all public areas. A/C was noisy when initially switched OFF!  It was good that the windows did actually open too - so no need for Air Con at night!------- We will come again,5,2012,09,03
115,Great Hotel,"Spent a 4 day business trip. The room was very clean and the service was excellent. The location is great, with everything within just a walking distance. I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone.",5,2012,09,02
115,"Stylish hotel, great location","Just spent the bank holiday weekend in this lovely, central hotel. It was perfectly located for the West End and close to the underground. Our room was a great size, very modern, and the bed was ridiculously comfortable. Nice toiletries, robes, slippers etc. We didn't have breakfast but we had a lovely drink in the bar downstairs.  Recommend this hotel for a nice weekend break.",5,2012,08,29
115,"Excellent location, charming hotel","This is a comfortable, classy hotel with an unbeatable location (Covent Garden, the British Museum and the West End theatres are all minutes away). I have stayed here for business several times and have always been happy with the service and facilities. The only two negative experiences so far have been: 1 - once I was kept awake by an air conditioner fan that was broken and automatically switched itself on several times during the night, making a loud noise. I explained this to the receptionist the following morning who made her apologies, but did not offer any sort of compensation. 2 - Another time, I could hear every word of the film my next door's neighbour was watching until 1:30 am (either he kept the volume at full blast, or the walls are paper thin) and I couldn't sleep until he went to bed as well, as a result. Apart from these two incidents, I am happy to recommend this hotel.",4,2012,08,28
115,A haven of comfort only a short stroll from the buzz of London.,"Spur of the moment weekend trip to London with my daughter and managed to get a great last minute online deal for a superior room. Chose  Bloomsbury  based on its central location and previous reviews. 

Very welcoming, scented candles and comfy sofas in reception area create a great atmosphere. Room had everything we could wish for and very stylish. Not huge room or bathroom but everything had been thought of: minibar, tea/coffee/ robes and slippers, huge very comfy bed, lovely toiletries. Turn down service replaced all our towels and left us bottled water by the bed.

Staff very helpful, concierge charged our phones for us while we ate breakfast as we had forgotten a charger! Breakfast buffet plentiful and lots of 'cooked to order' hot options too.

Some London hotels are nothing but a base for the night but The Bloomsbury had a really personal feel to it and we will definitely return.

",5,2012,08,28
115,Great location and friendly staff,"I booked this hotel as a birthday treat for a weekend of sightseeing in London. The building looks great from the outside and is in a fantastic location near Covent Garden, the British Museum and the West End. The interior has been nicely renovated with stylish and comfortable decor. The staff are friendly and we were given a spacious quiet room as requested. This hotel is definitely good value for it's location, high standard of accommodation and service and I would highly reccommend it.",5,2012,08,27
115,"Quality stay, close to everything.","Well what can I say just returned from the Bloomsbury and it is class in every sense off the word, close to everything, very helpfully,friendly staff.

Simply can't fault this hotel that just about sums it up do not hesitate book now!!!!!!!!",5,2012,08,26
115,Trip to The Globe Theatre & Bloomsbury Hotel,"Just had another wonderful overnight visit to this great hotel who also booked our excellent seats at The Globe Theatre to see Taming of the Shew.   The staff were their usual courteous selves, the room was fabulous - spacious and well appointed and the pre-show dinner delicious.  The concierge gave precise instructions for the wretched congestion charges and the best wayto get to the Theatre and the whole trip was smooth and trouble-free.

We always use The Bloomsbury for our London visits and cannot recommend it highly enough.  Thank you to the Manager and all his staff, hope to see you again very soon",5,2012,08,22
115,Chic and Sophisicated,"Booked this hotel for a one night stay to absorb London post Olympics.  The hotel has recently been renovated, the building looks wonderful from the outside and it just keeps getting better when you walk through the doors.  Our room was beautifully appointed, with a nice big comfy bed and decent size flat screen tv.  The room was small, but unless you pay for a suite, this is to be expected in London, regardless of where you stay.  That said, it was very stylist with a lovely bathroom.  Linen was lovely on the bed and the Towels were fabulously fluffy and soft (these things are very important to us).   The location of this hotel was one of the prime reasons we booked it and it is great for those who want to be near Covent Garden, Leicester Square and the main shopping areas.  We can't comment on the food or drink as we didn't partake - mainly because the prices for us, seemed very high, but you are spoilt for choice for resturants and bars in the local area and in London generally which suited us and we preferred to eat whilst out and about.",5,2012,08,20
115,Lovely stay,"I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday. We stayed in a superior room which was Â£158. Our room was great with tea and coffee tray, ironing board, gowns and slippers with lovely fluffy towels in the bathroom. The staff were very polite at all times.  The view wasn't great as we had a wall outside our window but the room made up for it.

As we left the hotel the receptionist asked If we'd like a water for our journey which we accepted. Wound definitely stay here again. 

Champagne by the glass was a little expensive. All in all a great time.",5,2012,08,19
115,Stayed during the Olympics,"Good building and a central location. The building looks to have been recently renovated and were completed to a high standard. Rooms are about average for London (small). Hard to judge the value for money as I paid Olympic prices. Biggest downside was that the air conditioning system was very noisy. Even when switched off in the room, there was a lot of noise from the vents in the wall in the bathroom.

The bar is below street level, but there is a nice patio on the side of the building that very few people seemed to find.",3,2012,08,15
115,What a disappointment,"After staying at their sister hotel in Washington D.C., I thought this choice was a slam dunk.  I arrived extremely early because of my flight, and it was merely a stopover for me to see friends while heading to Switzerland.  
I  told them that I'm aware I'm very early, but will leave my bags and walk around town.  Although, I asked how early they thought I would be able to check in.  I was told that I can check in probably by noon at the latest.
After numerous stops into the hotel during the day, I was told that they have a room, but if I can wait a little while longer they can give me a nicer room.  No Problem.
When I finally checked in around 2 PM (THANKS FOR THE EARLY CHECK-IN), the room was the size of a postage stamp with the tiniest window tucked all the way in the corner of the room and it was facing a wall.  wow!  I'm glad I waited for such a ""BETTER ROOM""
The website photos are truly not indicative of what you will be staying in.  Also, it was arguably the SMALLEST bathroom I have ever seen in my life.
The next day, I left my bags with the valet for a couple of hours since my flight wasn't leaving till evening.   When I returned to get my bags and wait for my car for the airport, I asked the General Manager if I can change some euros for pounds to pay for my car.  He told me that since I had already checked out, that it was against policy.   WHAT!!!!!   So, all of a sudden a guest who is no longer is not to be trusted, even though I paid by credit card.   He told me there was a foreign exchange down the street, but failed to mention that it was closed by that time, so I was SOL.   He was quite arrogant.
NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!",2,2012,08,11
115,Outstanding London Hotel,"My family travelled to London in July and stayed at The Bloomsbury. We arrived at 8 in the morning and were promptly checked-in. A big plus after a 13 hour flight. Our first impression of the hotel was very positive. The lobby was welcoming as were the staff. Our room was tastefully furnished, clean and very comfortable. My wife was very happy (and she's very fussy) with the room and you know the saying, 'happy wife, happy life'. The rest of our stay was bliss. Good breakfast, helpful staff and true warmth from everyone we encountered. The lady at breakfast always remembered my son's name and made an effort to make him a hot chocolate each morning. We wouldn't stay anywhere else when in London. Marc and Charlotte",5,2012,08,04
115,Respectability with almost family cosiness,"My daughter and I enjoyed this wonderful place in July, when visited London for sightseeing and Queen+Adam Lambert show. We booked the hotel almost 2 months ahead - and enjoyed reasonable prices with really high quality service. Room was impeccably cleaned on our request. Food from the restaurant was nice, particularly breakfasts with huge fruit plate and oat porridge. The tea cooking set (kettle and tea & coffee bags) made our days. Each time we came back from our daily city adventures, the delicate fragrance from candles in the glass jars along the way from the lobby to the elevators made us sigh with relief - ""at last home""... The personnel is highly complaisant and very friendly, ready to provide any help.
We were impressed by the marble bath interior in our room. This reminded to us the best Turkish ad Arab bathroom traditions. 
Just one wish regarding the bathroom: more towel holders and hygienic shower would be an advantage. 
We would definitely recommend this place to everybody who wants to enjoy quiet escape right in teh heart of world megalopolis.",5,2012,08,03
115,Beautiful Hotel in a Great Location,"The Bloomsbury Hotel is a wonderful hotel centrally located in London.  It is a quick walk to Soho Square, Oxford Street, Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square, Convent Garden, etc. -- and right near the Tottenham Court Road tube station to get you anywhere you want to go!

I checked in to my room late at night, around 10pm.  The staff at the reception desk was very courteous, and check-in took only 5 minutes.  My room was beautifully decorated and the perfect size -- it had large comfortable bed, nice-sized desk, clean and modern bathroom.  There is also complimentary wi-fi, which was a huge plus!  My air conditioning and TV were not working when I came into the room, but reception was able to come up to the room and resolve the issue right away. 

I also ordered room service a couple of times, and both orders were prompt and of good value.

I will definitely choose The Bloomsbury Hotel again for my next trip to London!",5,2012,07,29
115,Great value in London,"We were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The price was very reasonable, by London standards, and though the (standard) rooms were a bit small, the hotel was clean and pleasant, and the service was great. The location is perfect - just a few minutes' walk from the British Museum and the Tottenham Court tube station. The lobby is beautiful and equipped with oversized chairs/couches, including an area that serves afternoon tea, and computers/printers for use by guests. There are also complimentary water/iced tea and apples available for guests.",5,2012,07,28
115,London Stay,"We recently enjoyed an excellent stay at the hotel.
Firstly the room was beautifully presented and had seen the benefit from recent upgrdes. The staff gave a very professional service and made us feel very welcome.
This hotel provides the perfect base for a central london break, visiting the sites, shopping & seeing a show.

 Andrew & Emma Butler",5,2012,07,27
115,Great hotel,"From the moment we arrived on a wet and windy day the staff were all fantastic and a credit to the hotel. They are either very well trained or just very nice people who made us feel very welcome. Our room was a good size, beautifully decorated and immaculately clean as was the bathroom with lovely toiletries. Free wi-fi was a bonus as was the Apple docking station and a good quality hairdryer. I was also impressed to find an ironing board and iron in the wardrobe!  We had only paid for continental breakfast but there was plenty of choice and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The location was only a few minutes walk from the underground and really convenient for both shopping and theatres. The only small downside was the noisy air conditioning but all in all this is one of the nicest hotels I have had the pleasure to stay in.",5,2012,07,26
115,"""European"" rooms, but Very Nice!","This hotel is just gorgeous. If you're okay with a tiny room and bathroom, this is a fantastic place to stay. Gorgeous lobby, gracious concierge, great breakfast, delicious room service... Just don't be surprised when you find you can reach the sink from the toilet. Incredibly clean, good location...",4,2012,07,25
115,"Once bitten, twice not going back.","This review relates to two reviews i have had within the space of a month at this hotel. I am a GHA black member and have stayed at a few Doyle Hotels this year in London and Dublin. My first shambolic experience turned out with regards to my redemption of a black level experience for a we will rock you tour backstage tour and tickets + dinner and champagne.  Essentially due to incompetence everywhere i only received two tickets, no backstage tour, no dinner or champagne.. Things were also generally poor around the hotel with regard to  my stay. This has already been addressed and the hotel have offered my complimentary dinner and champagne as a way of apology. The next instance is with regard to my stay this weekend. As the manager seems happy to respond to tripadvisor reviews and not direct emails, i'll post the mail in here.

Hi Beccy, hope you are well. I just have spent two nights at your hotel in room 312. You may remember me as the guy who had trouble with his black redemption of the We Will Rock You Tour and meal, so i thought i would come back and see how things were again..
 
I have to say i was quite underwhelmed again i'm sorry to say. I'm not sure what i should be expecting being a black member but your hotel just doesn't hit the same standards as either the Kensington or Marylebone for some reason. I had paid for a suite this time so obviously wasnt subject to an upgrade and met Fabian again at check in who welcomed me back, so that was a good start. The room was fine but the first minor trouble was when i went to drink one of the waters on the table to find that it had already been opened and some drunk.
I was hugely shocked at how poor the breakfast was. I ordered salmon and eggs. This turned up looking more like a omelette in a basket with hardly any salmon. It was actually quite disgusting and presentation was very very poor. The orange juice that was served in the glass jugs was also rancid. Ive eaten breakfast before at your hotel and choosen exactly the same dish before so should know what to expect. So i didnt bother eating there on my second morning.
I'm also slightly underwhelmed as what i should expect as a black member for local benefits and choice of amenity. It was the same as my last stay, there was absolutely nothing offered to me. At the Kensington Hotel you receive a nice welcome note by the manager and a chef inspired dish for example in your room. Throughout my stay, there was zero, just bottled water on arrival of which i would expect any 4 or 5* hotel to offer one or two bottles free. So it would be nice if there would be some clarification as to what a black member should expect from your hotel. I realise the best hotel stays are the ones that go where nobodys noticed but at your hotel you just feel that you are there to collect the money with seemingly no personal touches aimed at your most loyal members.

So all in all i have spent close to 1000 gbp over the month in this hotel. As a diamond black member of hilton also, you get free room upgrade, executive floor.. Here i got a couple of bottles of water and a hotel which doesnt match its Doyle peers.",2,2012,07,25
115,Hidden gem in the heart of London,"Fantastic stay at this hotel. From the moment we entered until the day we left. The decor is great, the room was fantastically comfortable. The staff were attentive but not over the top. Just how I like a 5 star stay. Highly recommended.",5,2012,07,24
115,Stylish and could be excellent but some issues,"My husband and I stayed for one night in a superior room at the Bloomsbury Hotel whilst attending a business wine tasting event in May. 

Location: The hotel is in a great location, Oxford Street and Covent Garden are nearby and it is a short walk to Tottenham Court Road tube stop. There were a few steps up to the hotel entrance but the porters were very helpful in assisting us with our luggage. The reception area is very grand which gives a good first impression on arrival.

Rooms: Our room was on the small side, however very clean and traditionally stylish and well furnished with a large comfortable bed, chaise longue and some nice mirrors. WIFI was complimentary which was a bonus, then there were the usual in-room facilities: TV, tea and coffee tray, air conditioning, safe, iron and ironing board, hairdryer, but only one bathrobe which was annoying, and the lighting was too dark, so no good for putting on makeup. The bathroom appeared to be of a high standard until I ran the bath and scalded my foot... it turned out that the temperature control for the bath was broken so the water kept shooting up to boiling hot unless I held the control in place, which was inconvenient to say the least and could have been quite dangerous.

There was no gym or swimming pool. We had some drinks in the lobby bar which we enjoyed but didn’t eat in the hotel restaurant or have breakfast as we thought the price of £15 per person was extortionate! There is a decent and reasonable cafe opposite the hotel which we went to instead.

All the staff that we came into contact with were polite, friendly and helpful, particularly the reception staff who allowed us to check into our room early.

We got a business rate at £140 per night on room only, which I consider to be reasonable for London. However this was not as good value as our recent stay at the Pestana Chelsea Bridge nor was our stay as pleasant, as there were a few elements of our stay which could have been better.",3,2012,07,19
115,An excellent second stay,"We stayed at this hotel for the first time in January 2012 and did not have a particularly good experience. I wrote a review on this site and the hotel manager responded by asking us to email her to discuss it further. I emailed her and she offered us a complimentary nights stay including breakfast, which I thought was appropriate in the circumstances, but never the less very generous.
We stayed at the hotel on July 10th and had a really good night. 
Our room had been upgraded to a Studio Suite which was stunning. I didn't have the opportunity to use the free-standing, roll-top bath, but if I'd had more time I definitely would have indulged. There's even a built in TV to watch while having a soak! I did use the shower though, which had four separate shower heads, lovely!
The room also had a huge TV, an espresso machine and a very comfortable sofa. It was quiet (apart from people slamming the doors in nearby rooms early next morning. Cleaners maybe?) and very clean and well maintained. The room overall was beautifully decorated and furnished and very comfortable.
The breakfast was also of a really good standard; a huge amount to choose from at the self service buffet and also from the menu. The staff were pleasant and not intrusive.
We wouldn't have been able to afford a room of this standard ordinarily, but if we are looking for a luxurious treat in the future, we know where to go.
Thank you to the manager and to all the staff for giving us such a lovely stay and for putting right the disappointment of our initial stay in January.",5,2012,07,18
115,A spot of Afternoon Tea,We recently purchased a virgin experience voucher that we redeemed at the hotel for afternoon tea. The service was great and so was the food - we would definitely return!,4,2012,07,12
115,dissappointing,"This hotel is in a fantastic location - within easy walking distance of soho and its many bars/restaurants and all rooms have been refurbished to a good standard.  The building itself is beautiful and the interior is gorgeous.  We were all set for a fantastic night at the hotel until we discovered the bed throw had two large nasty stains on it.  On further inspection of the bed the pillows (under the pillowcases) were covered in hairs.  When I complained that the bed was dirty I was told 'it shouldn't be'!  I did realise that!  The bed was changed immediately and the housekeeper was very apologetic.  In my mind the room then felt unclean.  Unfortunately, things got worse when we realised that we were staying in the noisiest room ever and doors started creaking and banging from 6.20am onwards so returned from our stay feeling more tired than when we arrived.  When I mentioned it to the staff they just kept saying 'sorry' .... yes, us too!  Maybe we were unlucky ... but you take your chances!",3,2012,07,10
115,The Bloomsbury Hotel,"We stayed here for our 25th wedding Anniversary and had a wonderful time. The manager upgraded us to a suite and it was so beautiful, it really made the anniversary extra special for us.  We were also given a free cocktail   The staff are very friendly and helpful, the hotel is in a excellent location.  We will be staying again and have reccomended to family and friends.  Thank you to all at Bllomsbury.",5,2012,07,09

last but not least a special thanks to MALAKA. doing a wonderful job in the bar !!
you all made this trip one to remember  xx",5,2012,07,07
115,Nice breakfast,Great location but a tad expensive. We had a superior room but a large pizza would have crowded The room. Very nice breakfast but not included in price and at gbp 15 a person not exactly cheap,3,2012,07,02
115,"Clean and comfortable, but a little stuffy","We booked at this hotel after an experience with a the Clarendon a few years ago.  That room was small, and there wasn't a comfortable chair to read in the entire hotel.  The Bloomsbury did have comfortable chairs and enough light to read a book (important for us).  However, there were multiple people leaping to open the doors, often in morning coats, and there were maids entering the room five or six times a day, to ""check on whether things were as they should be.""  The last night we were there, we put the ""do not disturb"" in the door, and around 9pm, a card was slipped under the door indicating their distress that we did not want them coming in to turn down the bed, and begging us to call them if we needed anything.  Really, overkill.  We'll probably keep shopping for a hotel that is both comfortable and friendly.",4,2012,07,02
115,"Fantastic location, clean modern hotel and lovely breakfast.","I booked this hotel after reading reviews on trip advisor and I wasn't dissapointed.  The hotel is just around the corner from Tottenham Court Road tube, it is a 10 minute brisk walk to Covent Garden and theatre land and is on the edge of Oxford Street.

We stayed in a standard deluxe room, the rooms are not huge but adequate for a couple and luggage, our room was modern, clean and well appointed with a good sized wardrobe and luggage storage area, flat screen tv and ipad docking station.  The bathroom was very small and consisted of shower, toilet and sink and it had a heated floor, it again was clean and modern and had the usual toiletries etc.  The air conditioning unit is slightly noisy when in operation but it didn't stop us from getting a good nights sleep.

We paid for a full breakfast when we made the booking which appeared to be cheaper than paying for it at the hotel after arrival.  The breakfasts were lovely, there was a very good choice and range of fruit, cereals, cheese, meat, pateries, bread, juices etc presented well, and a seperate menu from which to order hot food, I had cinnamon french toast each morning of our stay as it was so delicious and my partner had the eggs benedict and blueberry pancakes which he also said was lovely.

Staff were friendly and attentive, there was also jugs of fresh lemonade and ice tea in the reception area for guest to enjoy complimentary, the lemonade was very refreshing after a hot day walking around the sites of London!

Overall the hotel is beautiful and clean, it appears well managed and the staff are well trained.  I regularly visit London and I will definetly return to this hotel not only because of its location but because it was a nice place to return to each evening after a busy day.  I would also consider using other hotels in their group if I was visiting other cities where they are located.",5,2012,07,02
115,Top Class Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights last week. All I can say is this is one truly beautiful and charming hotel in a great location just off Tottenham Court Rd.
When we checked in, we were greeted by a very nice doorman who greets everyone when entering or leaving the hotel
Rooms were very nice and beds very comfortable. Free WIFI was a major plus. We didn't eat at the hotel so cannot comment on the food. 
I would highly recommend this hotel",5,2012,06,29
115,Staff Who Care!!,"We came to London in the early spring of 2011 for meetings prior to participating in the Oxford Literary Festival. The beautiful Georgian building offers a calm elegance to the bustling landscape of Covent Garden. The first room we were shown to was a charming split-level double room, with the bathroom and dressing area above and the bedroom below. Unfortunately there was alot of street noise and air conditioner noise, which makes it difficult for my insomniac husband to sleep, so we examined two others. We were finally placed in a top-floor, corner room, which was very quiet indeed. The rooms were spacious and well-lit and the decor was tasteful. We had good wifi signal throughout the hotel. The bath products provided in the room were good quality, and there was even an iron and ironing board in the wardrobe! The food in the restaurant was very very good, as was the service at both dinner and breakfast. Breakfast was a sumptuous buffet. In the bar the mixologists are truly that! The atmosphere in the lobby and other public spaces is airy and comfortable and welcoming. All the staff we encountered were friendly and professional. I never had to open a car door, or the lobby door, and as soon as we would arrive back at the hotel we were offered assistance with our bags or shopping or whatever. We held a meeting in a quiet corner area of the lobby and were given discreet service. My congratulations to the managment team that oversee the running of this very smart hotel. Nothing can beat quality and location!!",5,2012,06,29
115,Beautiful Charming Boutique Hotel in the heart of the West End,"My second stay at this beautiful, friendly hotel. I stayed at The Bloomsbury for 6 days, end May on vacation.   After a long international flight, being greeted by a smiley doorman, refreshments of iced tea, fresh fruit and lemonade at the reception and an efficient quick checkin, I knew that my choice to return to stay here again a year on, was a good one.   Although  the hotel was fully occupied and my room was not ready, I was able to relax in the lobby on one of the large couches with my iPad as the free wireless Internet access (available throughout the hotel) was also pretty good.  My room was quiet, extremely clean, nicely decorated, with a bath which always had hot water.  Room service and the meal I had was excellent and beautifully presented.  Keep up the great standards, will definitely be back.",4,2012,06,28
115,Absolutely lovely,"Stayed for a week, great location just outside of Tottenham Court rd tube station, a short walk to Oxford circus and the Soho.

Staff extremely friendly, specially the ones at breakfast. Very comfortable room and bed, great night sleep.

Free wifi

Having a doorman greeting you whenever enter or leaving the hotel is a great plus :)",5,2012,06,25
115,Superb service of a bygone era,"I stayed at this hotel on business and found the service to be first class all round.  It is so charming having a doorman, fruit punch on arrival etc - truly service of a bygone era - think Agatha Christie's Poirot films!  I ate at the restaurant and the Irish waiter was really charming and attentive and the food was really good.  Rooms were great and very comfortable bed with plush pillows. Not a cheap option but you get what you pay for and this is worth the money.",5,2012,06,22
115,LOVED this hotel!,"We spent 4 nights there on vacation with our family. When we arrived, we were dismayed to find that the hotel had no record of our reservation. It was not the hotel's fault--it was the travel agent's fault.  We were treated like royalty while it was sorted out.  They brought us tea, apologized profusely for the delay, gave us vouchers for free drinks in the bar, and, after our reservation was finally found, they upgraded our rooms!  The accommodations were lovely, the beds were extremely comfortable, the location was fantastic, but the staff was really outstanding, particularly Brian.  We loved the breakfast and the wi-fi.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2012,06,21
115,superb hotel,"We stayed here for two nights and found from the welcome we got on arrival to when we left the staff were all friendly and courteous. The room was clean and very comfortable, towels changed daily and room tidied in the evening as well.The location is superb as the tube is handy but also within walking distance of a lot of attractions. The breakfast was superb! and We would be very happy to return for another stay, strongly recommend this hotel as fantastic value for money",5,2012,06,21
115,"Lovely hotel, fantastic service, unbeatable location","My wife and I stayed here for three nights during a recent trip to London for our anniversary. We stayed here based on the reviews and were not disappointed. The hotel is lovely, the service is impeccable, and the location is hard to beat. One perk is that the hotel is within easy walking distance to everything in the West End, yet is whisper quiet at night. There was no noise whatsoever. Fantastic! I also love a hotel that has some character and style. The Bloomsbury is a throwback to another era, one that predates all of the corporate hotel chains that predominate today. It felt refined yet homey. 

We had a deluxe room, which was still on the small side, but perfectly fine for our needs. The bed was amazingly comfortable and the nightly turndown service was a nice touch. (A robe and slippers were also included.) The room featured lots of small touches and little amenities that made it more pleasant. These included a full-sized iron and ironing board, a decent-sized in-room safe (my 15"" laptop did not fit), a large closet, an iPod dock with speakers, and so on. The room featured a small desk and an armchair. The lighting system was terrific, as you could control most elements of it from the bed. There was a flat screen TV that we did not use. Two bottles of water were provided daily. Dry cleaning service was available, another nice touch, although we did not use it.

The bath was particularly nice, with white marble everywhere, a full-sized tub, and nice soaps and lotions. 

Cleaning service was provided daily with no problems. My wife used the workout room, which she described as small but perfectly adequate for this type of setup. The breakfast buffet was not included in the price of the room, so we skipped it. This seems like something that should come included in the price of a ""deluxe"" room, but it wasn't a big deal.

My lone complaint is that the internet service, while free, was very slow and often somewhat useless. I wish European hotels would figure out that in this day and age, working high-speed internet is essential, not a bonus. At these prices, I expect to have working, high-speed internet. I'm willing to pay extra, even, but this is really something this and other hotels should look into. It's akin to not having hot water or plumbing that functions. That's a minor complaint, however, and overall our stay was incredibly pleasant. Thanks to the Bloomsbury staff for making our trip to London memorable! We will return for sure.",5,2012,06,21
115,Ottimo hotel in zona servitissima,"I spent 2 nights in this hotel, whch is located in a silent street just a few steps away from Tottenham cour road, and 5 minutes away from Covent Garden and the British Museum. The hotel was newly renovated and it shows; the lobby is gorgeous and staff kind and helpful. Rooms are nicely furbished, in a modern and sober taste, with more than sufficient storage room (which is not so common!). Bath was not huge but perfect, room was decently sized (mine was number 610) and pretty silent - fantastic bedding and free wifi, which is a plus. 
I also enjoyed the breakfast, quick and efficient, with a smiling staff and great toast (all warm food/drinks on request). Good value for money and lovely atmosphere in a pretty convenient spot in London - strongly recommended.",5,2012,06,19
115,Lovely hotel would definitely be coming back,"We stayed for 2 nights to celebrate our 10th anniversary!  The staff in the hotel were outstanding, the door staff greeted us from our taxi carried our bags for us and were very helpful through out our stay, Our room was spacious and very comfortable, the breakfast was lovely and had alot of choice, we will definitely be staying here again and would recommended to family and friends, thank you to all the staff at the hotel for making our weekend so enjoyable!!",5,2012,06,18
115,Fantastic hotel fantastic value,"I won a stay in this fab hotel last year and I realised the week before it expired and yet the hotel very kindly extended the voucher.
When you walk in you are greeted by beautiful lobby area, candles burning, lovely sofas. 
The receptionist was very welcoming and helpful,
The room was beautiful, very modern , clean and beautifully appointed. Lovely bathroom with walk in shower and a bath tub.
We had drinks in the bar downstairs where they make a mean cocktail !,,
Breakfast in the morning was absolutely delicious
I have travelled extensively with my job, staying in hotels at least 4x per month so I have a very high bench Mark and I can honestly say I would recommend this hotel to anyone because the standard was so high.
I am going on a girly weekend to Dublin soon and I have booked The Westbury because it's the Doyle Collection company who own the Bloomsbury. I am hoping it is going to be just as fabulous !!!!",5,2012,06,17
115,Not bad but not the best,"We stayed for 3 nights for our 15th Wedding anniversary! 
The staff on the door are fantastic... Whenever we needed a taxi they would run up the road and not come back without one! 
Our room was a good size and bed extremely comfortable. Bathroom was awful... Every time we had a shower water went everywhere! Curtains around shower were useless! Also bedroom so hot... Window wouldn't open enough.
Also had a wakeup call at 8.30am on last morning??? Not requested by us! I think they wanted us to check out promptly!
Good location.... ",4,2012,06,15
115,short weekend stay in London near Covent Garden,Good 4 star hotel within 10 min walk of all restaurants (famous ones are The Ivy and J Sheekey) and theatres around Covent Garden area. Only 100 yards from Tottenham Court Road Tube Station and 10 mins walk from Leicester Square tube station. Very professional experienced staff and smart modern room.,4,2012,06,11
115,Excellent customer service,"Stayed here for two nights on a room only basis for the queens jubilee and my partners birthday. I had emailed the hotel ahead to inform them in was his birthday and had an email straight back from Michelle that they had added complimentary continental breakfast to our booking for both days!! On arrival was greeted by the concierge who were very welcoming, after a bit of confusion about payment at the reception we was shown to our room, big enough with beautiful decor and a very comfy bed!! The breakfast was buffet style with more than enough choice to satisfy everyone's needs. On the morning of my partners birthday we was greeted with a champagne breakfast complimentary of the hotel which should of cost £31 each!! This was beautiful and a wonderful gesture from them. The cleaners came to your room twice a day and changed towels both times if requested which was a lovely touch, nice to come back to the room with the curtains drawn and the dressing gowns on the bed ready for us!!  Would definitely stay again and would recommend to everyone thinking of staying here!! ",5,2012,06,07
115,"Nice hotel, great location, shame about the service.","The Bloomsbury is in a great location, near to Covent Garden, Theatres and The British Museum. The hotel lobby is lovely, however, the rooms are small and very dark! Ladies there is not enough light in the rooms to even do your make up easily! The service in the hotel was very poor for example: there was only one dressing gown provided, yet two of us stayed in the room, our morning papers were not delivered, the hosue keeper knocked on twice prior to check out to see when we were leaving which was very rude, and the porter did not bring our bags up to the room, we had to go down and pick them up ourselves, only to arrive and they then offer to bring them up - bizarre! 

When asked on check- out if everything was ok, we explained why the service was lacking , to be advised the Manager would give us a call to discuss our concerns further...still waiting for the call! 

It isn't a bad hotel at all...just lots of room for improvement- especially for the price and the fact there is so much choice and you can easily stay somewhere else for the same price with better service.",3,2012,06,06
115,A Luxurious Escape In London,"London offers more hotel options than one can easily fathom. Everything from a budget hotel to near palaces fit, literally, for kings and queens. In between these extremes are hotels like The Bloomsbury. The service from everyone we encountered at the hotel was supurb. From the bellman to handled our extensive amount of luggage (my wife never travels lightly) from the cab to our room, to the people at the front desk who checked us in and endured our travel weary humor, to the maids who made sure our room was always clean and well appointed. 

The hotel offers a very nice breakfast. It wasn't included in our room price and, if I have any complaint at all about the hotel, it would be the price of the breakfast. However, once you're eating it, the sting of the price fades away a bit. Our room was not overly large, but it was VERY comfortable. 

The hotel is located in an area that is perfect for hitting nearly all of London's vast, interesting sites. We had intended on using the Underground to get around, but we found that our location allowed us to easily walk to most of what we wanted to see. We did ""Tube"" it to places like Tower Hill and Knightsbridge, but most everything else was a pleasant walk from the hotel.",5,2012,06,01
115,1 night stay for a conference,"Had a night here for a work conference and was well looked after. Room was smallish and on the back so quiet but bathroom was huge, mainly because it had disabled facilities. Shower was open to the room except for a flimsy curtain so water went everywhere but suppose this was for wheelchair users, who knows.
Free wifi, decent breakfast (extra charge) but a great location just off Tottenham Ct Road. Would go back.",4,2012,05,31
115,Fine hotel in the West End,"I quite liked the location of this hotel, the room was really nice and the reception and concierge were very good.  However this hotel is really let down by the restaurant. I ate there for 5 breakfasts  and two dinners and other than the pleasant Philippino waiter the rest of the staff were either rude or incompetent or both and the breakfast provided is more low rent cafeteria than 4 star hotel.",4,2012,05,29
115,Good spot,"Small rooms but guess that's te ey it is in
London.  Very central to lots of activities and great service.",4,2012,05,28
115,A perfect stay on a fantastic hotel!,"This was really a surprise! A very nice hotel with excellent staff. The service is perfect and we have been so well taken care of.

Thankyou especially John, our waitor at the terass. And thankyou everybody at The Bloomsbury Hotel for making my anniversary to a day to remeber!",5,2012,05,27
115,Good experience in the end.,"The Bloomsbury Hotel met my expectations for a central London 4 star Hotel. Check in was fast and easy, had some issue with the cleaning of the room ( they forgot to do it) and even though I called to remind them when I was back from my day of walking the room was the same. Gym and facilities were very good and check out was a little slow, asking for a taxi was also very slow but I guess it was the time of the morning, something to bare in mind if you need to catch a flight at 7am from Heathrow.

I would go back to this hotel in the near future if I go back to London. Recommended.",4,2012,05,26
115,"Good hotel, but there's room for improvement","Stayed here for 4 nights. As a third guest in the room, they assured me on the phone that my bed would be big enough, but instead it ended up being a pretty tiny one with no room for my feet, so I had quite uncomfortable sleeps. I Was offered a separate room but with a surcharge, so I declined. It once happened that by mid-afternoon our room wasn't cleaned up yet, so I requested the desk to send the maids, but somehow they showed up nearly 1 hour later! But the worst part of the experience was the bathroom, because the sink was clugged and the shower was hard to figure out how to use. But, other than that, the place was great: perfect location ner Oxford Street, very nice staff and there was a nice atmosphere in the main hall. They even gave you vouchers for one free drink at the hotel bar, which is a treat I've never received anywhere else. The bathroom and cleaning service problems were just a combination of bad luck, but they need to be more clear when they explain the accomodation for a third guest in the room. Other than that, I'd have no problems staying with them again.",3,2012,05,25
115,A great place to stay,Excellent service from arrival to departure. The staff were attentive throughout our stay. Nothing was too much trouble. We had a very comfortable double room with all the amenities required for a short stay. The food was excellent. The breakfast on offer was a fantastic variety to suit all tastes. There was even fresh papaya. I recommend this hotel as a perfect place to stay for a weekend in London.,5,2012,05,23
115,A haven from Oxford Street bustle,"Despite being only a 100 metres from Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street this hotel is a quiet haven away from the hustle and bustle. From the moment you walk into the candlelit reception you feel relaxed. Staff are friendly and check in is efficient. Rooms are a good size and the bar and restaurant are never busy or loud. All in all a good hotel for business or leisure and reasonably priced. Sister hotel of The Marylebone, Welbeck Street.",4,2012,05,22
115,Excellent,"This hotel excels itself in every way. Amazing service from the moment we entered the doors, concierge was just what you'd expect. We didn't have chance to try any of the dinner service but breakfast was adequate, full English or continental available. The room was clean, maybe a little small but it was big enough for what we needed. Bathroom was beautiful, very modern. Don't have any complains, would stay again. I will say that you get what you pay for here though, it's not a 'cheap' hotel, but if you have the money to stay here, do it.",5,2012,05,22
115,Good location,"Stayed here for one night only with my teenage family for bed & breakfast.  The staff were very obliging and nothing too much trouble.  We were able to book in early and leave our cases as the room was not available till 2.30pm, and again leave our cases on Sunday till we were ready to collect them for our return home.  The hotel is decorated to a very good standard , quite traditional and my husband & I stayed in the delux suite on the 6th floor which was a good sized room.  The bathroom was lovely with separaate bath and shower and heated floor.  Would visit here again but stay an extra night.  Another plus is breakfast on Sunday is available to 11.30am and check out is 12pm.  Very close to Totenham Court Road tube and Dominion Theatre so a handy location",4,2012,05,22
115,Anniversary celebration,"My husband and I booked an executive queen room for one night last Friday and were extremely pleased with the service at this hotel.  We were given a voucher for two free cocktails to celebrate our anniversary, which was a very nice touch.  We have never stayed anywhere where the staff were more friendly and obliging - nothing was too much trouble.  The hotel was very clean and the room, although a little on the small side, had everything we needed to enjoy a lovely stay.  We would definitely recommend this hotel to any guests.",5,2012,05,21
115,Lovely hotel in a central location,"After a brief overnight stay in 2011 I came back to stay at the Bloomsbury for 3 days for a work trip. In spite of a busy central location near Covent Garden and the theatre district, you immediately feel relaxed on walking into the candle lit reception. The rooms are spacious and decked out in calm modern colours, with all the little touches needed to make sure you enjoy your stay - including huge fluffy towels, pristine sheets on the pillow topped bed and high-tech flat screen TVs with a great selection of channels. Staff are lovely, and the hotel seemed nice and busy. The only thing stopping me from giving it a 5 star review is the lack of a swimming pool and the same noisy air conditioner that other reviews have mentioned (though only heard this for max 20 minutes over my 3 days) I would definitely recommend this hotel if you're working or playing in this area.",4,2012,05,20
115,"Jim & Carlene ""Great Hotel, fabulous Staff""","We stayed at this hotel in March of 2012, and it was a great place to be, the staff was great every single one of them that we interacted with, the room & bath was clean, easy walking access to Oxford Street, if you like shopping, the Art gallery & theatre. We enjoyed our stay and will recommend it to all interested, and we will stay there again.",5,2012,05,17
115,Absolutely fabulous!,"My husband and I stayed at The Bloomsbury as a weekend shopping trip for his birthday. 
I had a look on the hotels Facebook profile prior to the trip and said that we were very much looking forward to staying with them. 
We arrived at the hotel via the tube (Totenham Court Road station is literally around the corner!) we were a couple of hours early for check-in but the concierge took our bags for us and gave us an umbrella as ""it looks like it may rain later"" :-) 
When we returned to the hotel we were told our bags were waiting for us in our room & that we had also been upgraded (always a nice surprise!!) 
We walked into our room on the 7th floor & were gobsmacked, the room was spacious, beautifully decorated & the bed was a lovely size! We had a walk in closet & the bathroom had a free standing double shower aswel as a bath & a TV!! We were welcomed with champagne on ice & a birthday card for my husband..fantastic service! 
The hotel itself was beautiful with candles & flowers in all areas. The staff were extremely helpful & the concierge staff in particular were polite, pleasant & very helpful! 
We dined at the hotel for breakfast & had the full English and bits from the continental. My husband enjoyed croissant & orange juice and the cooked breakfast was very nice. The only gripe we had was that the waiting staff kept forgetting things & we did end up waiting quite a while in the end for hot food. But it did not dampen our experience. 
The location of this hotel is second to none! We were there for the shopping & with Oxford street round the corner we were not disappointed! We also saw a show at the Dominion theatre, which again is a five minute walk away. 
We visit London 3-4 times a year and always try to stay in different hotels, however I will certainly be booking the Bloomsbury for our next visit! 
",5,2012,05,12
115,Nice hotel in a great location,"I stayed at the hotel for a business trip. It was a nice, comfortable place to come back to after a long day. The room was tastefully decorated and much larger than what you'd typically get from a centrally-located London hotel. My only issue is that the room was not well ventilated and the air conditioner was loud. All in all still a very good stay.",4,2012,05,12
115,Good Hotel great location,Stayed here recently with my partner. Room was good. Staff were pleasant and helpful. Would definately stay here again when I return to London,5,2012,05,09
115,Good location and friendly staff,"We stayed at this hotel for a weekend during April.  The hotel is very conveniently located near to the Dominion Theatre but it is extremely quiet considering its location.

The check in/out was efficient and our bedroom and bathroom were surprisingly spacious.  The room was also very clean.

The food, drink and service were excellent and a wonderful breakfast was served in our room on each morning.

We will definitely use this hotel in the future when we stay in London.",4,2012,05,09
115,A bit disappointed,"I stayed over the bank holiday weekend and booked a standard double room on the leisurely london package which cost £204 in total. The late check out with the leisurely london package is very convenient. Having stayed 4 times before at this hotel I know that the hotel is fautless for both it's location and staff friendliness. It is also very clean and the rooms are lovely. This time round I was disappointed because (1) on check in I was given a check in form with another guest's details on it and asked to sign it. I explained the details, which included an address, tel no and email were not mine, only to be asked to cross them out and write in my own because ""the form printed out like that"". Confidentiality of guest details is clearly not an issue but I think it should be!  (2) The TV in the room only worked properly after jiggling the wires at the back (3) Only 1 bathrobe in the room and that was tatty with 2 holes in it (4) at breakfast I heard 2 other guests complaining that their food was cold and late, although both these issues were dealt with quickly and politely by the staff. These issues are only small and on balance I will probably stay at this hotel again because the previous 3 times the experience has been better.",3,2012,05,07
115,Beautiful hotel close to theatres,"The Bloomsbury is a lovely relaxing oasis of calm located just behind the dominion theatre off Tottenham Court Road. Considering the hotel is just off the main drag of the busiest shopping street in England it is very quiet and there wasn't any noise at night. 

The hotel was refurbished around 4 years ago and its rooms are modern, elegant  and most importantly very clean. We stayed for two nights over May bank holiday and couldn't fault the hotel or staff. We will definitely be returning as the location was brilliant and the hotel exactly to our liking.",5,2012,05,06
115,"Perfect Location, excellent service","This hotel is in the perfect location, close to bars, restaurants, theatres and within walking distance to the busy shopping area of Oxford Street.

The hotel rooms are so elegantly decorated and very clean, the bathrooms are stunning and have heated floor tiles which is a nice touch.
The beds are very comfortable and i have the best sleeps on those pillows everytime i stay here.
The walls are abit thin but not too disturbing, you will never hear the outside traffic as the windows are sound proof.
If you are booking one of the King or Queen Suites, you will not be disapointed, they are my favourite rooms in this hotel.
The bar has a really warm feel to it and having barman Malaka working there just makes your stay even more pleasant, he really makes you feel at home and will go over to everyones table to make sure they are happy with everything and see how their stay at the hotel is going (very nice man).
We had dinner in the bar and we had the most loveliest man Andrei who was looking after us, he made sure we had everything we needed and always came back to check if we were ok.
They also have a terrace where you can sit outside with the heated lamps so even when the weather is bad you can still chillout with your drinks outside. We had afternoon drinks out on the terrace and concierge Nalif was so lovely looking after us.

All in all you will have a lovely stay with excellent service, friendly staff & great food if you stay at The Bloomsbury. 
Anytime i'm in town i will always stay at this hotel. Why go anywhere else when you can have all you need in one place.",5,2012,05,05
115,perfect location but their breakfast was poor,"the hotel is in a prime spot .. 2 min walk from tottenham court road station and 10 min walk from oxford street....the room we stayed in was king deluxe which is the room that anyone should take .. the standard room is very small .. gets u claustrophobic and has no view ... bathroom floors were surprisingly heated...room was posh and the bathroom too .. 

had continental breakfast but the variety was very pooor .. all meat available was pork or ham, which didnt leave much option for muslims..croissant and cereal and that was it .. poached eggs as welll .. when asked for  omlette or scrambled we were asked to pay 5 pounds additional which is a pretty hefty amount for eggs!! had to make a fuss to not pay those additional pounds considering the lack of variety !!",4,2012,04,30
115,"Great location, nice room, efficient service but poor sleep","Great location - right by Tottenham Court Road tube station and the vibrant Charlotte Street area and Bloomsbury.

Sleep quality - the bed was firm and nice and there was no noise from the outside (road traffic, delivery etc), but the walls seem paper thin and I could hear the TV from the adjacent room and people coming and going in the corridor.

Room - while the room was small, it was well laid out, nicely decorated and had everything I needed (ironing board, hairdryer, kettle).

Service - while the fron desk staff were polite and efficient, no one except Jeni (?) went the extra mile, engaged in small talk, smiled at you, etc.",4,2012,04,30
115,Lovely hotel in a perfect location,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury for 6 nights and were fully satisfied with the hotel. It is a wonderful location - very close to the Tottenham Court tube station, and with the British Museum just up the street, and as other reviews have noted, in walking distance of many neighborhoods. The lobby and common areas were elegantly furnished, yet warm and comfortable, and kept immaculate. The room is very nice - not a whit of tacky hotel feeling. And the staff was friendly and helpful. We were really quite impressed.",5,2012,04,29
115,Fantastic,"Our first visit to London, so there were a few things I was looking for with regards to accommodation.  It had to be nice, obviously, but also central to as many of the touristy sites as possible, with enough shopping options at hand to melt my wife's credit card.  I wanted to sample 'traditional English pubs', and ingest as much warm English ale and 'pub grub' as possible.  Thank God we stayed at The Bloomsbury!

Arriving from Paris via Eurostar at St Pancras Station, both my wife and I were unable to locate Platform 9¾ despite our best efforts.  A three-minute cab ride to the hotel, where no sooner had our luggage touched the footpath than a nice young chap appeared and whisked them upstairs. This became the (gold) standard of service we received from the staff at The Bloomsbury: attentive, cheerful, courteous, and always one step ahead.

We were two hours early for check-in, so amused ourselves by sniffing around the immediate surrounds, and soon discovered that (had we been so inclined) there is literally no need to go more than 500m from the hotel -- a dozen great pubs, the British Museum, the shopping mayhem of Oxford Street -- all within a lazy amble.  That could easily have been it for me, but my wife wanted to see all the ye olde tourist attractions, and so The Bloomsbury became our walking base.  It was perfect.

We stayed in Room 403 and I have to admit that I giggled like a little girl when I first stepped into the room.  It totally exceeded expectations, and for once was every bit as good as the photos you see on the website.  In fact, our room IS one of the ones on the Doyle Collection website!  Spacious, quiet, modern, ridiculously clean, with a big bouncy bed and down pillows, I don't think I have ever slept better in my life.  Huge television, and another one in the bath!  Awesome.  Walk-in robe where we could tuck our suitcases out of the way, and all the usual quality amenities you would expect from this verging-on 5 star hotel.

The hotel is so handy to Oxford Street that I now have permanent friction burns on my hands from hauling shopping bags up and down the street for my wife, who went into somewhat of a  frenzy.  There are so many pubs (my favourite, the Three Tuns) nearby that it almost made decision-making irrelevant -- just spin a bottle, walk a hundred meters in the direction indicated, and prepare for the gastropub experience of a lifetime.  Say what you like about the English, they know how to fry a chip!   

Finally, the hotel made me break my cardinal rule, that when on vacation one never dines twice at the same hotel.  The Landseer Restaurant, on the lower-ground level of the hotel, was the best eating of my life, and was so good it will be getting its own review. breakfast was served in the Landseer, and the daily buffet was varied, interesting (kippers!) and fresh.

This hotel gets full marks from me.  We walked everywhere from The Bloomsbury except the Tower of London, and only then because the London Marathon was underway and there were annoying road closures.  For that really rainy day, having the British Museum 50m up the road was sensational.  i don't know if staff at The Bloomsbury review TripAdvisor postings, but if they do -- thank you and well done, we had the time of our lives!",5,2012,04,28
115,Top Class,My wife and I stayed at this hotel for one night only when we came up from Brighton to an evening performance of the Warhorse at a nearby theatre. Although we were only in the hotel for a short time we were both very impressed. All the staff were friendly and very efficient. The room was a delight. It was very clean and had all the 'extras' you don't always find in hotels. Wifi was free and easily accessible and the TV in the room showed amongst other channels Sky Sports. The hotel also provided other 'perks' which again added to feel that the staff really wanted to look after you such as ready available soft drinks on arrival and bottles of water to take with you on departure. We only ate breakfast at the hotel but here to the staff were 'on the ball' and the food tasty and plentiful. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. ,5,2012,04,24
115,"Cosy Hotel, great location","Nice hotel right near tottenham tube station. Everything else (soho, covent garden, oxford street) in walking distance",4,2012,04,22
115,Honeymoon of Dreams,"We checked into this hotel for our Honeymoon and from start to finish, it was a dream. Compliments to the chap who checked us in, very pleasant, efficient, respectful and he smiled. Our room was stunning and so clean. Service in this Hotel top class. Thank you - we will definitely be back.",5,2012,04,21
115,Great little boutique hotel in London,"I loved this hotel - the lobby is beautiful, the gym is nice, and the rooms are very modern.  I like to stay here when I am in London on business.  It is right at Tottenham Court Station and is within walking distance to Soho, Covent Garden and Oxford Circus.",4,2012,04,17
115,Excellent stay!,"The Bloomsbury hotel is an excellent choice due to its key location, with an easy access to the main tourists spots. Room was well furnished, comfortable, beautifully decorated,good size, and overlooking Great Russel Street. When you walk in the hotel, the atmosphere is very warm and the concierge and reception are very welcoming and helpful. We definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2012,04,15
115,"Very good value, very friendly service.","Nice hotel, charming in fact. Very well located (Tottenham Court tube is 2 blocs away, British Meseum is at a 3 minute walk)  Received great service. The concierge service was quite friendly and effective in gaining me suggestion for restaurants and ways to get last minute tickets to a play. I truly appreciated having North American standard electrical outlets available near the desk  in the room !  Same with free wireless service (although not nearly as fast as one would expect in 2012, but hey, t'was free).  Breakfast included with base price  nice buffet, enough to chose from. But food services should know what a café au lait is however !!  ;-)",4,2012,04,14
115,4th Stay at the Bloomsbury,"I had the pleasure of stopping at this fantastic hotel whilst on business in London on the 2nd April. The hotel as always was spotless, the concierge and front desk were as always attentive and pleasant. As other reviews suggest the rooms are not overly large but are comfortable and very well furnished in a contemporary fashion. The breakfast room is well appointed and the service and quality of food was good. I do however have one issue, during my stay in room 706 I was repeatedly woken by a knocking noise coming from either the plumbing or A/C, switching off the A/C at 4am made no difference. I did report the fault to the night desk who, to their credit offered to change my room, something I didn’t relish at 4am, but that was my choice I did at least have the option. On checking out I was asked if I enjoyed my stay to which I replied yes but unfortunately I had a noise in the room, I then asked if it was reported, It hadn’t, apologies were given and I was told that the manager would be informed etc. In my job I don’t get the opportunity to travel extensively, my hotel choice is usually made by myself so the Bloomsbury is my hotel of choice in central London I don’t usually write reviews but this hotel is so good I think that my issue, the fact that I had a disturbed night’s sleep, should be addressed by the management if the hotel is to further improve on what is already an excellent establishment. This one issue has prevented me from giving 5 an excellent rating, hopefully at my next visit, and I will visit again these issues will have been addressed.",4,2012,04,12
115,Lovely place to stay,"Had our second visit here in February 2012. It really is a lovely hotel in central London. Rooms are small but beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean. Staff are very friendly and helpful.
Can't comment on the food in the hotel as we refuse to pay £20 per head for breakfast.",4,2012,04,09
115,Hotel was fine,"I like boutique hotels a LOT!  This place definitely covers that for sure, its my 3rd stay here,but my first time reviewing.  I think its hard to rate any London hotels well, as the rooms are always SOOOOO small.  As someone who has traveled to about 30 cities across the globe, the rooms in London hotels are always small, but you can't hold that against the bloomsbury, obviously.

Their staff is always very helpful when you need.  The location is great as well, especially being so close to a major underground station.

The restaurant is so-so, but with so many other places accessible, don't let that influence your decision.  The Bar (Landseer) in the basement always has a nice set of tech-geeks it seems like, and the bartenders down there are always great, with whipping up great drinks and offering advice for tourists / visitors.

I'd recommend this place for sure, just keep in mind, the rooms are gonna be small.",3,2012,04,01
115,good quality hotel efficient staff,"My wife had an accident a couple of weeks before we arrived and she arrived in a wheelchair, all the staff were very helpful as soon as we arrived assisting in using lift  at side of hotel to foyer then very efficiently booking us in and giving us the opportunity to have another room with a shower for use with disabilities. the room was very clean.and cosy.. we used the bar which was spacious enough for the wheelchair and the service , drinks to table, were lovely. Toilets emaculate .Due to mobility we used the room service and the food was bought up fast and  was smashing. All the staff were so nice and pleasant they made what was  unusual and difficult circumstances for us with my wife in a wheelchair an enjoyable occasion. It was very close to theatre area,British museum and covent garden. 10 out of 10 for everyone there.Thank you and we will definately return .(were there 9/3/12 and 10/3/12)",5,2012,03,31
115,Very Poor Treatment,"I stayed here recently for a week on business and have stayed here several times before with great satisfaction. When I arrived it transpired that there had been a mix up that that the agent I booked through (otel.com) had cancelled the booking without calling me. Anyway they assured me at the check in desk that they would sort this out. I sat down in their lobby for almost an hour without anyone updating me. Then when I went to the desk they said that they could do nothing they were fully booked. I asked to speak with a manager who ended up giving me a room for the night and saying he would sort it out in the morning but that I would have to check out the next day. I checked out the next day and was told I would be called in the morning to confirm there was a room available from the manager - no call came. I called them in the afternoon only to be told that they could do nothing there was no room and I would need to book in somewhere else. I couldn't believe how poorly I was treated. They said they could book me in the following day but that I would have to pay their daily rate which was triple what I had booked per night. I asked them to honor the rate which they said wouldn't under any circumstances. Had they made it clear on the first night that there was no room I could have made other arrangements however they left me completely dependent on them and were useless. I asked why they had not done this and the manager said he hadn't wanted me to feel ""deserted"". I can't believe that they would treat a customer in this way. I had to book another hotel and arrived back to the hotel late to collect my bag the manager then said he could fit me in and would honor the rate. After all of their fuss and the stress they caused they could honor the rate so they lied in the first instance. The people on the check in desk couldn't have been less useful. I would never stay here again as I cannot imagine being treated worse. On top of this the breakfast is exceptionally poor.",1,2012,03,29
115,Good quality hotel in excellent location,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights in March, and loved the place.  It's not a typical big chain hotel, and although we didn't eat there, the downstairs bar was good for a quiet nightcap at the end of the day.

The staff were all great, and maid service and towel changes twice a day were unexpected but impressive.

The location is excellent.  Less than 5 minutes walk to the top of Oxford street, 10 minutes walk to the heart of Soho and Covent Garden.  I'll definitely stay here again.

One negative was the cost of a cooked breakfast at £22 per person (I'll never understand high charges such as this, as you can get a 2 course set lunch there a few hours later for £12!).  But there are some nice and much cheaper small cafes virtually next door to the hotel where you can get breakfast for much less.",4,2012,03,29
115,Lovely hotel in central location,"I usually stay at more business-oriented hotels as the rooms are more spacious and you can get a great rate on the weekends, but since it was a special occasion - a boutique hotel was more appropriate. I booked The Bloomsbury as it seemed to be very central and had a nice decor, and most reviews were positive! 

We arrived an early morning and our room was not ready, this seldom happen and it's my first time at a London hotel checking in before official check-in time that I've not been given a room straight away. Fortunately they had luggage storage so we could wander around while waiting for the room to be cleaned. I loved the lovely decorated reception area and the candles that were lit up in different parts of the hotel. It also smelled wonderful at all times, so the atmosphere was great.

Our room was nice, but a bit on the small side. The bed was a queen size and could barely fit the two of us (and we're very normal-sized!). I loved the free internet access and the bath products from Aromatherapy Associates. Most of the room seemed to be of a great standard and I'm very picky! Our window was faced toward a backyard, not interesting and a bit sad, but then again it was quiet.

The location is excellent, and it's perfect if you like shopping, eating out and sightseeing as you have lots of choices nearby (Oxford street, British Museum, SoHo). I would definitely stay at Bloomsbury again due to the location!

Most of the staff were polite and helpful, but there was one girl in the reception who seemed a bit nonchalant and acted surly. The reason I'm not giving the hotel ""Excellent"" is that it is quite expensive unless you get a good deal, the surly girl in the reception, the tiny size of the bed and the sad view from the window.
But I will definitely recommend Bloomsbury to others and hopefully we will be back!",4,2012,03,27
115,Great Stay,"Really enjoyed my stay - I am not a fan of most London Hotels but this was one of the exceptions.
-	Very conveniently located.
-	Spacious rooms - not the largest but reasonable size for London.
-	A reasonable gym (though weirdly missing machines for legs – seem to have everything else covered)
-	Great customer service for most of the part - Got coffee with my wakeup call with a very pretty flower
Continental Breakfast has a good range of food

Good conference facilities - we had some technical difficulties starting off and to recover from the issues the hotel offered first round of free drinks to all the delegates",4,2012,03,26
115,WONDERFUL OASIS IN CENTRAL LONDON,"I booked this hotel for a weekend theatre trip as it had very good reviews.  We were not disappointed.  The hotel was immaculate having recently undergone a refurbishment.  The staff were so attentive and approachable and it must be the quietest central London hotel I have stayed in.  I am a very light sleeper and slept soundly here.  It is in an ideal situation just around the corner from Tottenham Court Road underground station.  The rooms boast all mod cons and the little extras such as the towelling bathrobes, slippers and umbrellas hanging in the wardrobes all added up to make a fabulous weekend.  Will definitely be returning.  My only gripe has to be the extortionate price of food and drinks.  £7.50 for a Tia Maria, £21 for breakfast.  Fortunately there is a very nice Cafe Rouge just around the corner next to the Tube Station and we had breakfast there each day for £5.95 (fresh croissants, baguettes, freshly squeezed orange juice and coffee).  I do feel the hotel is missing a trick here.",5,2012,03,26
115,Very very good...,"This was a surprise for my wife's birthday, and the whole stay was fantastic, the staff were helpful attentive and friendly, and the room was excellent
Highly recomended",5,2012,03,25
115,excellent,"My wife and I recently spent a thoroughly enjoyable week at the Bloomsbury Hotel
on Great Russell Street in London. Accommodations, staff and location could
not have been better. Big theater goers, we were within 10-15 minutes walking
distance of the theater district and saw 6 productions during our stay. We had a great 
hotel deal through Great Escapes, which made our stay even more enjoyable--and
affordable. Two thumbs up for the Bloomsbury Hotel!",5,2012,03,22
115,"Location is A+, but at 250 pounds a night, sleep would be nice.","Phenomenal location a few blocks away from the Tube and the British Museum. The hotel appears to attract mostly business travelers (see 250 pounds a night note!) The decor in the lobby is excellent and makes the hotel seem luxurious. The staff from reception are welcoming and competent. The concierge in particular was excellent, giving knowledgeable suggestions with just the right amount of British charm.

The room was a little disappointing size wise, but you have to remember your in the middle of downtown London and it was certainly adequate. The main issue was noise from the other rooms. Because of where the televisions are mounted on the walls of the rooms (basically directly above the adjoining rooms' headboard,) we were unfortunately able to hear the audio of our neighbors until the wee hours of the morning.

We alerted the hotel staff, and while they weren't able to do anything about it that night (which is understandable), they did move us to another room (upgrade actually) which did not have the same problem. That showed great service and was appreciated.

Still sleep is important!",3,2012,03,21
115,"Quality, location and charm","This outstanding four-star hotel is located near Tottenham Court Road tube stop, a very convenient location just a few steps from the British Museum. The street, however, is quiet, but sightseeing or shopping is easy.

Being a four-star hotel, one would expect a lot from the amenities and services, and the Bloomsbury Hotel delivers. The hotel offers friendly service, from check-in personnel to concierge and room service. A lot of extra amenities are available, such as a newspaper delivered to your door, 24-hour room service, a gym, free tea and coffee making facilities and even complimentary shortbread.

In addition to daily cleaning, there is a complimentary evening turndown service. The room was very clean and comfortable, and quite large for a central London hotel room. There is a mini bar, but sadly no fridge space for guests' own snacks. The TV has plenty of British and international channels, and free WiFi is offered throughout the hotel. The rooms are located in a labyrinth of corridors, and the most remote rooms enjoy more privacy and quiet. While the walls in room are by no means paper-thin, sounds from the corridor do leak in, like in most hotels. Furthermore, there was a constant, though not annoyingly loud mechanical humming sound coming from the adjacent building. While the noise was audible 24/7, it wasn't loud enough to disturb our sleep. This problem might only affect the rooms on the edge of the building. But there were occasional louder sounds eminating from the air conditioning vents. We didn't really have a view to speak of either.

However, these were minor complaints, and overall we were very satisfied with out stay. The continental breakfast was quite nice, with fresh fruit, good yoghurt, the usual cheese, eggs, charcuterie etc. Scones and muffins seemed to be available only sporadically, though. Full English breakfast is also available at a higher cost.",4,2012,03,19
115,Great location but not great hotel,"Pleasant entrance and helpful staff and stayed in superior room .Room decor ,furnishings nothing special but just about ok for a four star , fairly clean and comfortable . Awful nights sleep with noisey guests  in corridors in the early hours that the duty porter had to sort out twice .",3,2012,03,11
115,Luxury at Sensible Prices - But Some Gremlins,"This is the second time I've stayed here with business.  And I will be returning in April, as this is one of my employer's preferred hotels.

You can't fault the location, just off the Tottenham Court Road at the end of the main stretch of Oxford Street.

When I checked in this time, I was welcomed back and later, when I got into my room, there  was a hand-written note from the manager, again acknowledging I was a returning customer.  A nice touch.

Whilst my previous stay was uneventful, I hit a number of issues this time.  First of all, the original key card I was given didn't work, so after a few attempts to enter my room, I had to return to the reception to get a new one.

Then I discovered that the TV in my room didn't work.  Maintenance duly arrived and managed to get the set working, though I was warned that if the problem returned, this would require a change of room.  On returning from dinner, the TV had indeed frozen again, and so, having just run a bath and unpacked, I had to relocate to another floor.

The third misfortune happened at breakfast.  When I checked in, the very personable receptionist offered a discounted full breakfast for £15.  I was happy to add this to my reservation. However, the following morning, the restaurant staff presented me with a bill for £21, the usual full cost.  I queried this, given I had pre-paid the lower amount.  When the waitress returned, this time it was with a bill for £5.  This, she said, was a surcharge, as I had only paid for a continental breakfast.  Given I had been offered a discounted breakfast rate, I still disputed this extra charge, but decided to resolve this at checkout.  When I did checkout, the receptionist removed the surcharge from my invoice, even showing me the annotation on my guest record card, indicating that I had indeed pre-paid for a full breakfast.  Interestingly, the restaurant staff seemed happy to tell me that they'd already had the ""same problem"" with another guest that morning.  Regrettably, it would appear that the problem was with the restaurant staff not being aware of this particular deal.

The first time I stayed, I paid for an upgraded room, as the standard rooms were all occupied, but I needed to stay with colleagues who had already secured the rooms we normally book.  The upgraded rooms are very comfortable indeed, with lots of added extras.  This time, I was booked into the standard rooms.  American guests would probably say they were on the small side, but for central London and in such an historic building as this, they are of a decent size.  But they are still comfortable, nicely lit and with a regular sized bathroom. The evening turn-down service is a nice touch, along with a bathrobe and slippers.  I've always slept well here.  Navigating the slalom of corridors is interesting, though this adds to the character of the place.

The front-of-house team members are all very polite, sociable and efficient.  Whenever you encounter them, they will always strike up a conversation and show genuine interest in the day you've had, or evening planned.  The offer at breakfast is a mixture of a continental cold buffet and a cooked-to-order hot English breakfast.  And very tasty, with polite service (though the bill issue took the shine off this).

I am looking forward to staying here again in April.  Repeat guests are certainly made to feel valued.  Hopefully, next time, all the technology will work and any breakfast offers will be honoured by the restaurant staff.",4,2012,03,08
115,Beyond expectations...,"With the current economic climate you don't really expect to get much for what you pay for, even if the price is quite high. This hotel has made us hopeful again of good service in decent hotels.  Staff were very friendly and not snooty, our doorman (Asian/Middle Eastern?) always had a smile for us (should've asked for his name as  his other colleagues weren't that smiley!)   We also got an upgrade which is always a very nice surprise.  We stayed over a Sat-Sunday and it was fairly busy.  Location was fantastic, as either the back way to the hotel or the main road one was easy to get to. (from Tottenham Court Station)  Lots of cheap Korean restaurants past Centre Point, which was a bonus and a more upmarket one near Holborn called Asadal.  
All in all nearly perfect, there was a problem with being billed with a phone call, I rang hotel reception to request for a late checkout, and I don't understand why this came up on the bill as a charged call.  They did remove it from our bill, it was only 40p, but it was strange how calling within hotel phones would incur a charge.",5,2012,03,06

115,Welcoming hotel in excellent location,"We stayed here for three nights and found from the welcome we got on arrival to when we left the staff were all friendly and courteous. The room was clean and comfortable, towels changed daily and room tidied in the evening as well.The location is good as the tube is handy but also within walking distance of a lot of attractions. We would be very happy to return for another stay.",4,2012,02,26

115,"Bloomsbury Hotel,Steps from The British Museum","Spent too brief a time in The Bloomsbury, late Fall in London (2011) the weather was perfect to explore the area from the hotel, a few short strides can take you to The Dominion theatre, The British Museum.  A little further west,  you are in Oxford Street, head south for West End theatres, Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square and The National Gallery.
The hotel was built as a YWCA at the start of The 20th Century, conceived by renowed designer, Edward Luytens, it is a lovely Victorian Era structure. A charming lobby appears as you enter from the not terribly busy street it is situated on. Greeted by a friendly staff, shown to a comfortable and capacious room, we were happy to be there.
Just one evening spent but resolved to return to Russell Avenue and the charms of The bloomsbury.",5,2012,02,22
115,brilliant hotel,"stayed at the bloomsbury hotel feb 2012 from fri until mon and have to say it is one of the best hotels ive stayed in.  staff were very friendly and helpful, hotel was in a great location and rooms were in excellent condition and very clean. breakfast is a bit pricey but you are staying in a 4 star hotel afterall and there is a great restaraunt just round the corner",5,2012,02,15
115,"Great location, great hotel","Location was great for this hotel, just off the main shopping road so very convenient.   Staff were very good.  Rooms nice.

Price for breakfast was over the top but there are a couple of cafes just a few doors down.",4,2012,02,12
115,"Just an all-round average 4 star hotel, but free wi-fi - BRAVO!","This hotel was just very bog standard really for a 4 star London hotel. Nothing terrible about it, but nothing particularly great either.

Our bathroom (room 519) needed some attention. The bathroom door would not open unless pushed hard because it became jammed against the floor. I mentioned this to Reception who said they would ask Maintenance to sort it out. Maintenance did nothing & I had no further response from Reception about this complaint. We were staying for 3 nights & having to practically charge at the bathroom door became very tedious & annoying. Had we been elderly we probably wouldn't have had the strength to even access the bathroom. The sink tap is positioned too close to the mirror which means you can't turn the hot water on properly, & the sealing strip at the bottom of the glass divide in the bath/shower kept falling off. These are small things but not acceptable.

On the positive, the room was spotlessly clean & sufficient for our needs. Also, a very big ''well done'' for the free wi-fi. I find it a real con when hotels charge for wi-fi access, so this was very welcomed - thank you.

The staff were friendly & largely efficient, but that can't include Reception or Maintenance as they didn't sort out the door problem. The doormen were particularly cheerful, friendly & efficient. The location is good as the nearest tube station is just around the corner.

I work within the travel industry & own two unrelated travel companies. I communicated with the hotel before my arrival & advised that I was looking to find a new quality 4 star London hotel to offer to my off-shore clients. My trip was personal & not for business, but at the same time whilst I was staying at The Bloomsbury I was viewing it to put future business their way. I made them aware of this but they obviously still thought it acceptable to put me in a room with a sub-standard bathroom. Needless to say, I will not be recommending this hotel to my clients & The Bloomsbury have lost out on a great deal of future bookings. 

There are better 4 star London hotels out there.",3,2012,02,11
115,Great Staff!,"We recently spent three nights at the Bloomsbury Hotel and had a wonderful experience. The location is great--just up the street from the British Museum and a couple of minutes from the Tube and buses. The hotel itself is very attractive, with comfortable rooms. (I loved the radiant heat in the tile floors of the bathroom!) Only negative was the lighting in the bathroom, overhead halogen spots over the sink, that make putting on makeup difficult. 
     The most amazing thing here is the staff. They went far beyond efficiency, being genuinely friendly and eager to please. We really put them to the test, as it happened. A day after we moved on to a hotel in Oxford, I realized I had forgotten my pillbox with my blood pressure medication back at the Bloomsbury. I phoned in a panic, and they said they would talk to the cleaning staff. I figured that they would have thrown it away, and worried about how I could get the medicine in the UK. Then, they called back, and I was delighted to hear that the cleaners had kept it, ""Just in case it was important."" What are the chances? The wonderful concierge and his assistant sent it on to me by courier and I got it the next morning. They even called the following day to make sure I had gotten it. What wonderful service! I love everything about this place! We'll be back.",5,2012,02,09
115,Nice hotel,"I was just in London for two days for a shopping and theatre visit, and stayed for one night at the Bloomsbury. It was a bit of a treat to stay centrally (normally I'd choose something perhaps in Greater London or even travel back home the same evening.)

The location of the hotel is perfect. Short stroll to theatres, restaurants, to all kinds of interesting shops along Denmark Street and Charing Cross et al. Excellent for visiting the British Museum.

I stayed in a room on the third floor and it was a very decent size. The bathroom was delightful, with black marble and large shower. Various nice bathroom toiletries and small bits you tend to forget at home (such as cotton buds!)

The bed was comfortable, with various pillows for choice. After I came back in the evening, I found my bed had been turned down and already the few items I'd used (e.g. cream in my tea) had been re-stocked. I slept well overall, although at times I found it got a little too hot in my room. Probably I could have had a look at the air con and turned it up, but it wasn't as bad for me to do that, and I soon fell into a peaceful sleep.

I didn't have dinner at the hotel, but breakfast the next morning. I chose Continental, and it was a buffet with similar choices as I'd seen in other hotels. The coffee was very good, as were the range of juices and marmalade/jams available.

Overall it was a nice (if short) stay and I would choose this hotel again in future.",4,2012,02,09
115,"Great Hotel, Variable pricing along the year","Stayed at the hotel several times in the last year (2011) for business.
Rooms are great, service is excellent and the location is unbeatable - on SOHO and Covent Garden, and within walking distance from everywhere else (unless you prefer the tube of course).
Only issue is that pricing can vary a lot (which is also true for other hotels in London) - I have paid anything from 180 pounds to 280 pounds (occasionally prices went even higher, but that's where i drew the line). Trick is to book at least 2-3 weeks in advance (which is doable if you can plan ahead, unlike my situation in some cases), and of course depends on the season",5,2012,02,09
115,"Great Hotel, Great Location.","Stayed for two nights (3rd and 4th February) as a treat for my 50th Birthday and was very happy and pleased with the Hotel.  I was with a friend and the hotel happily turned our room into a twin bedded room for the weekend.  The room was lovely and clean with modern and stylish bathroom (took a while to work out how to use the shower!) and very comfortable beds (if you like soft beds like me...although my friend would have preferred a more firmer mattress)  The rest of the hotel was lovely with nice little touches which made all the difference (the floating candles and the gorgeous incense smell in the corridors!)  The location of the hotel, in our opinion, was perfect for getting out and about.  We were on Oxford street shoppin withing 5 minutes of leaving the hotel.  Also we were seeing a show in Picadilly on saturday night and again, just a few minutes away.  Would definitley use this hotel again when visiting London and highly recommend it.",5,2012,02,07
115,Fantastic Stay - thank you!,"I simply cannot fault this hotel. The customer service was excellent, quality of rooms lovely, and very good location.

i would have no hesitation in returning here and would highly recommend it to anyone staying in london - location is perfect for the theatres and restaurants.",5,2012,02,06

Quick check in and very friendly og helpfull staff, very where in the hotel.

115,"Great hotel, fantastic staff, awesome bar","This hotel is very nicely located, a short walk from soho, covent garden and picaddily. The rooms are very nicely done, with great screens, confortable beds, and awesome bathrooms. 

More importantly, the staff is really nice. The bar downstairs is just perfect. Malaka knows how to treat his customers and he definitely knows how to make cocktails. 

I would definitely come back to the bloomsbury for my future trips to London.",5,2012,02,01
115,My go to hotel in central London,"When visiting London on business, I always check to see if there's a room available at The Bloomsbury before checking anywhere else.  No there aren't any hipsters in the lobby or neon jellyfish in the elevator, just a well run hotel that meets my needs as a business traveler.  

The hotel itself seems like it's been around a while, like most things in this area of town.  It's been properly kept up and has a nice sized lobby if hanging out/working outside your room is your thing. The rooms are 100% modernized and the sizes vary depending on type/location in the building.  There's a nice restaurant downstairs for breakfast which has a buffet type option if you're in a hurry or you can order the full English if you have the time.

I really like the location because it's on a street with nothing else!  No clubs, theaters or other late night noise that can keep me up. But it's just a short walk from all of the fun of downtown London but I can escape away for solitude and a good night's rest.",5,2012,01,31
115,Excellent on all counts,"Stayed end of January 2012 for 3 nights - a trip for my partner and I. The hotel was way above expectation - friendly staff, GREAT location, lovely public rooms and bedrooms. The few small requests we made to staff were dealt with promptly and efficiently. We will definitely use The Bloomsbury again and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone else.",5,2012,01,30
115,Fab!! Comfortable & stylish.,"The Bloomsubury is located just around the corner from the Dominion Theatre nr. Oxford street so a great place to stay if your going to see a show or shopping in Oxford street. 
The hotel has a lovley lobby and friendly staff. Candles and insense in the hall way throughout hotel.
Room is very comfortable and smelled georgous. The bed was very comfortable and had a great night sleep, very cosy and nicely decorated. Quite spacious too. Would recommend this hotel definately.",5,2012,01,30
115,Smashing,"I stayed at the Bloomsbury in mid January.  I was skeptical because my friends chose the hotel from a fly+stay deal from the KLM.  The lobby was very attractive, but I was still wary.  The room was actually very nice.  The bellman tried very hard to get the window open, and then apologized profusely when he couldn't (no fresh air on the top floors).  
Breakfast in the restaurant was mediocre, but room service was great.  Much better, but you do pay more.
What made this hotel so great was the location:  near the British Museum, the West End, and Oxford Street.  We walked most places. I loved it!  It's in such a great area.
With one minor exception, the staff were unbelievably helpful, friendly, and informative.  
I like trying different hotels, but I might just have to stay here again because it's so very convenient.  
I recommend this hotel enthusiastically.",5,2012,01,30
115,We will be revisiting !,I have stayed in various London hotels over the years and overall I have had some very good experiences but my most recent visit to the Bloomsbury Hotel I have to say is well up there in the top rankings. The staff were attentive and genuinely pleasant in their manner towards their residents. I liked the offer of free refreshments upon arrival in the foyer and upon leaving the offer of a free water to take with you on your journey. Some other top London Hotels could learn a thing or two from the management at this particular hotel. We also appreciated the free cocktail vouchers for the bar which we did use and as a consequence we stayed most of the evening drinking some very nice cocktails. The bar itself had a lovely ambience and the staff there were also very attentive and tried hard to please.The rooms were very clean and nicely decorated. We had breakfast in our room and I have to say my full English was good. My wife's breakfast comprised of smoked haddock was overdone but I can't say it was inedible. Both my wife and I have stated our intention to visit again soon.,5,2012,01,30
115,Good service and comfortable rooms,"We stayed two nights here at the end of January, a weekend away for my partner and I. Staff were helpful and polite, the room was comfortable and bigger than others I've stayed in London at a similar price. Free wi-fi is always a bonus but watch out for the bar and restaurant prices - expensive. The full English breakfast is £20, continental £15, cheaper if you book in advance. The location is absolutely perfect for theatres and Covent Garden, both within ten minutes' walk from the hotel. The British Museum is less than five minutes along the road.",4,2012,01,29
115,Exceptional service,"I stayed at this hotel recently on business and was really impressed with everything the hotel had to offer. Really friendly, helpful staff and very high quality accommodation. The location is also really good, close to Oxford street. I would definitely recommend staying here. ",5,2012,01,26
115,Helpful staff and vibrating area,"I had contacted the hotel staff before travelling informing them our flight to London arrived early in the morning and that we would probably be there a few hours before check-in time. When we got there, they managed to get us in earlier than expected, which was already a good start. The decoration of the common areas has an interesting mix of modern and traditional. The room that we were given was indeed not very big (this is what is often said of hotel rooms in London, however). Moving around with two pieces of luggage could have been complicated if not for the closet available - where we had to store one of the suitcases. Another minor was with the setting of the shower temperature - it seemed to have a life of its own and get colder by itself. On the bright side, the room was always kept very nicely. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful, which is always very appreciated. One day walking through London - which offered a lovely weather by the end of October - I twisted my foot. When asking at the reception, very quickly someone sent a bucket with ice which solved the problem for me. And the staff member responsible for it was kind enough to ask if I was feeling better on the next day! Finally, the area where the hotel is located was perfect for us, very easy to move around both by foot and by public transportation, with the Central line located at a 2 min-walk from it.",4,2012,01,23
115,"Lovely hotel, perfect location for theatres","Great hotel, good size rooms with everything you could need - temple spa toiletries. Nice selection for continental breakfast buffet. Perfect location for walking to theatres, Covent Garden, Oxford St. Relaxed welcoming atmosphere.  ",5,2012,01,22
115,Pleasant and well situated,"Well presented, and conveniently located for theatres and shops. The lobby has a welcoming, old-fashioned feel.
Check-in and check-out was quick and efficient, and staff attentive and friendly.
Superior room was clean and comfortable and we slept well, but next door's wall mounted TV could be heard quite well in the morning!",4,2012,01,22
115,Excellent stay!,"Just got home from a very quick trip to London.  And my stay at The Bloomsbury couldn't have been more comfortable. The public area of the hotel was always welcoming and warm.  Yet, it still reflected and olde British standard. The room was well appointed and much larger than I had expected (after numerous of my friends had told me the rooms in London were among the smallest they had ever stayed in).  The staff were more than helpful and very friendly - as I became a regular at the restaurant for breakfast they would great me warmly every morning, ask about my plans for the day and provide a bit of interaction for my solo trip, which I appreciated.  Returning to my room every evening after stomping around London all day was a pleasure.  My bed was always turned down for me and the bathroom was prepared for the start of my next day.  On the room - the bed was one of the most comfortable I've had.  Most importantly, the room was always kept clean and well ordered. I have to give a special thanks to the staff, also, for helping me to fix my luggage before I left.  They eventually tracked down a pair of pliers and got me all fixed up.  This alleviated a lot of anxiety for me.  The location couldn't have been better either: close to a tube station that I became quite familiar with and just next door to The British Museum and a short walk to Drury Lane.  I became quite comfortable with the neighbourhood, as well.  The doormen were always willing to provide directions or assistance to restaurants and amenities and inquire about my day and offer suggestions for my travels. If I ever return to London I will definitely stay here again.",5,2012,01,21
115,"Perfect location, really nice hotel.",It's the perfect location and a really nice middle class hotell feeling lika a luxury hotel. Nice flowers and a perfect smell of fig scented candles.,4,2012,01,20
115,"Location, Luxury, Quite, and Attentive","The hotel knows how to make you feel like you are a guest and they understand hospitality.  During my stay I never touched the front door handle.  From the moment you step up, both of the double doors are opened by attendants that warmly great you.  The lobby hotel smells so good with candles lining the halls to the elevator, front desk people that cater to you, restaurant and bar staff that tend to your needs and a feeling of warm welcome in the air.  You are almost proud to stay here.  

Our room had a large comfortable bed with a large LG flat screen TV.  We had plenty of room for two super-sized suitcases.  The bathroom had marble from floor to ceiling and great lighting.  We slept so well.  

The hotel is so close to the party and night life of SOHO a 5-min walk, a 2-min walk to the Tube (METRO), and very close walk to many attractions and shopping.  A number of local pubs and fine dining are close to the hotel.

The day we checked out, they handed us both a bottle of water and offered to watch our bags if we had time to enjoy the city before our flight.",5,2012,01,18
115,A little disappointing for the price,"We stayed here on the night of my husband's 40th birthday. We arrived at noon and were unable to check in until 2.30pm so we had to leave our bags. When we returned at 10.30pm, we were a little underwhelmed by our room. Don't get me wrong, it was clean and nicer than most hotels I've been to, but I can't help feeling it wasn't worth the money. The room was stiflingly hot and when we put the air con on, it was too loud to sleep. So we had to turn it off and suffer with the heat. When I finally got to sleep, I was woken by drilling at about 2.15am. This went on for two hours at intervals of 15-20 mins. Next morning, we both had showers and found that the shower screen didn't meet the side of the bath, there was a gap of about a centimetre which meant that the floor of the bathroom got covered in water. I also thought that we could have been provided with more than two sachets of sugar and coffee in the room, a bit miserly! We told the duty manager who apologised but didn't offer us any refund or compensation as we had already paid, but instead gave us his email address so we could get a discount the next time we visited. Not good enough I'm afraid. We're not going to risk paying those prices for another sleepless night. The hotel is beautiful but I felt that the service was  impersonal and overall, disappointing.",3,2012,01,18
115,"great location, great staff and quiet luxury","we stayed at the bloomsbury hotel for my wifrs 30th birthday weekend arriving on the friday and departing on the sunday. firstly the location is great. getting off the tube at tottenham court and walking up the steps to the dominion theatre you know you are in the heart of things. a few hundred yards of a walk leads you to this great hotel, in a quiet side street. on entering the hotel you get the wow factor with elegant surroundings and staff opening the doors for you. check in was simple and as we were early the consierge put our bags away and brought them to the room for us when it was ready. the rooms were big enough for what you get in london with a mini bar (charges applied) wide screen tv, wardrobe, ensuite, hairdryer and all the other bits you would expect. hotel bar was a bit expensive but you expect that in a place like this although not as dear as drinking in the south of ireland. atmosphere in the bar was great too. didnt eat here as we had dinner booked in claridges gordon ramsey restaraunt. just around the corner is oxford street which is busy but comfortable. i would recommend this place especially if you are going to oend a few hours around the hotel",5,2012,01,17
115,Luxurious accommodation for a girlie shopping weekend,"This hotel has it all, including a great location right next to the Tottenham Court Road tube station. The service was good, the rooms clean and relatively large. Also, the afternoon tea served in the lobby was  very nice. The only constructive feedback I'd like to say is that I would expect a wider choice of pillows, since all of them were quite thick! And we never learned how to put the volume on the tv... :)",4,2012,01,16
115,Great old style hotel!,"We arrived at this hotel for a weekend break,There was three of us girls ,someone helped us in with our bags ,while we were getting checked in they took our bags up to our room,hotel staff were very helpfull  ,we had a pre theatre meal in the hotel which was second to none ,we will be back in the future ,we all really enjoyed our stay.",4,2012,01,16
115,Great weekend,Stayed on a Friday and Saturday all the staff very helpfull. We stayed in a superior room which is the most basic but its still a nice room very clean and has every thing you could want just a little tip pre book your breakfast its cheaper all in all a great hotel,4,2012,01,15
115,"Excellent location, great staff but need improvement on housekeeping","I stayed here with my wife for 3 nights after Christmas Day in 2011.  We booked Superior Room through booking.com but got upgraded to Junior Suite during check-in.  The room is extremely big and clean.  Bed is very comfortable.  The hotel also provides us 2 bottles of water (one still one sparkling) every day.  Location of the hotel is excellent, few steps to Oxford Street and Tube (Tottenham Court Road).   
Drawbacks: 
- Breakfast is over-price but you can find a cafe few steps outside the hotel providing cheaper English Breakfast.  
- The room has 2 bathrobes provided but were taken away by housekeeping during our 2nd day without replacement.  
- No refrigerator for guest own use in the room.
- No replacement for coffee cube though they have espresso machine in the room.",4,2012,01,07
115,Lovely hotel in an excellent location,"This hotel was lovely and was of the nicest I have stayed in. Everywhere was spotlessly clean and the whole place had a gorgeously cosy, yet chic feel to it - was an absolute pleasure to stay there!
Unfortunately, we had to move from the room we were allocated, as the television was not working. However, we were allocated a larger room and were also given vouchers for 2 complimentary cocktails in the hotel bar, which was a nice touch.
We stayed on a room-only basis but did eat in the hotel restaurant on our first evening. The service was great and the food was lovely - it was also excellent value - 3 courses for £25.
The staff at reception were both approachable and pleasant, and called us a taxi when we asked and also answered any questions we had. There were also complimentary drinks at reception - mulled wine, home-made lemonade and iced tea - nice refreshement after pounding the streets of London Town!
I will defintely stay at this hotel again, as I really feel as though it has the perfect blend of luxury and quality, without comprimising a friendly, approachable service.",4,2012,01,07
115,Brilliant stay for New Year,"We had a great stay at the Bloomsbury for New Years Eve. The whole place was lit up with candles and had a very opulent feel about the place.  The staff couldn;t have been friendlier although I echo previous comments about how slow it was to get served in the lounge area during the day, not good if you are in a rush. Great location and a great hotel, I will be returning!!!",5,2012,01,05
115,Oh so convenient and great staff,"This hotel is brilliantly located for Covent Garden, Oxford Street shopping, West End shows and the British Museum is just along the road.

The staff are very friendly and helpful without being in your face, particularly John who works the bar and afternoon tea area.

Rooms are on the small side but immaculate and have everything you require.   Very modern bathrooms, lovely bed linen and fabrics.   Would definately stay again and recommend.",4,2012,01,03
115,Top notch hotel,"I have just returned from a New Year's Eve break and have to say how nicely surprised I was with this hotel.  It was affordable, included breakfast and was much more luxurious that my partner and I expected for what we had paid in such a Central London location.  The staff were friendly and welcoming.  The room, although small, was nicely decorated and I was pleased that the bathroom came stocked with shampoo AND conditioner! Perhaps the only constructive critism I could raise was the fact there was only one bathrobe despite it being booked for two people and the mini bar didn't work - however when I rang reception about this, I was brought a drink to my room free of charge.  A nice touch was a paper of our choice was delivered to our room in the morning and we were given a bottle of water each when we left.  Will definitely stay again.  ",5,2012,01,01
115,Could be excellent with a little attention to detail,"We booked this hotel for a weekend visit to London. The hotel is really well placed for Oxford Street, Soho and tube stations. The customer service was friendly, the decor of the hotel luxurious in the public areas and the rooms well decorated and clean if a little on the small side - to be expected in a city hotel. We ate breakfast 2 mornings which was good and plentiful.  Good full english on the second day with the only complaint being my husband's scrambled eggs were a bit over cooked. We ate in the restaurant one night which was excellent. My biggest issues are really only small but make a big difference: on arriving at our rooms our key cards didn't work, so as housekeeping were around doing turn downs they let us in. This also happened on the third day of our stay - we came back from breakfast to find they didn't work again and we had to go all the way back to reception to get them reactivated. Very frustrating! We also had only one set of towels in our bathroom on arrival when the room had clearly been booked for 2 people. I asked housekeeping if they could bring us another set, which didn't materialise, so we then asked at reception when we went down to dinner. When arriving back to our room after dinner the towels still hadn't arrived and I had to phone down to reception to ask a third time. They did eventually bring some up, but I feel it's really unacceptable to have to ask so many times for something which should have already been in the room. My other grips are that they only supply 2 measly pots of milk with the tea tray - how much does it cost really! And for a reasonably expensive room, no water in the room, just the mini bar. Plus when booking the cost didn't include VAT which put the cost of the room up quite a bit on check out. Overall, it was a good hotel, but the little things that were wrong could have made it an excellent hotel.",4,2011,12,30
115,Friendly accommodating staff,"Lovely hotel in quiet location but within two minutes of Tottenham Court Road. Unusual layout, being an ex-university building quite unlike standard hotel design.

Staff were charming from beginning to end.  I was given a pleasant room, but looking out onto a very small well/courtyard.  When I asked if I could have an ""exterior"" room, the receptionist immediately found one and I was able to change with no trouble at all.

The room perfect in every way, beautifully designed and furnished.  Admittedly, it would have been on the small side for 2 people, but was excellent for the business traveller.  I heard no noise from other rooms; after reading other recent  reviews I wonder whether I was just lucky.

Both the continental breakfast, with a wide selection of foods, and the individually cooked English breakfast were of a high standard.  All in all, I could not fault the hotel in any way.",5,2011,12,30
115,A lovely central hotel that caters to the business traveller.,"Lovely location and a very nice hotel. The room was nice but on the first night I recieved a call from reception to turn the TV down as it was disturbing the next door neighbours. Very strange, it was 09.30pm and the TV was only at half the total amount. 
Other than that everything was perfect. Nice breakfast in the room.",4,2011,12,19
115,Disappointed,"When I arrived at the hotel I was very impressed with the warm welcome from the male receptionist and the offer of mulled wine which I gladly accepted. When I arrived in the room I was surprised by how small it was. To get around the bed I had to virtually climb over a large chair. 
My husband joined me later to get ready for a Christmas party night.  After eventually working out how to get the shower on we found we only had one bathrobe. I came to dry my hair but struggled as the only mirror in the room is on the back of the wardrobe door and my hairdryer lead wouldn't stretch. Why are there no other mirrors in the bedroom? 
I hoped that the party would be better! Unfortunately I have to admit to being very disappointed with the food. I had ordered steak expecting to be asked how I would like it to be cooked - I wasn't and it arrived well done and cold.  As were the potatoes! I didn't complain as we had waited a considerable time and I didn't  like to create a fuss. Admittedly the dessert was lovely!
On a positive note the bed was extremely comfortable but during the night the size of the large furniture in a tiny room became an issue again when my husband fell over a low table by the bathroom door ! 
At 5am we were awoken by the television of the adjacent room.  I could hear every word of the programmes watched for the next two hours.  I appreciate that the hotel is not responsible for the noise of guests but the placing of the tv and the evident thin walls are their responsibility.
The continental breakfast was good and it is positive that breakfast is included in the price as this is not often the case in London.
On checkout I had hoped to raise all my grievances but disappointingly I was not asked about my stay.
Fortunately the concierge was able to find me a taxi quite quickly to make my departure! ",3,2011,12,16
115,"great location, not a great room","I stayed at this hotel for a business trip of three nights. I arrived late (10pm) and got great service at the front desk, two doormen, and plenty of smiles and welcomes. When I arrived in my room (room 706), it was fairly small, but comfortable enough for one person for a few days. I wasn't looking for luxury, but just a place to sleep for a few nights. I went to look out my window and I found a dark square of roof with a fake tree in a pot. No wonder the shades didn't work, there was really no reason to look out the window and it was certainly discouraged by the nonworking shades.

The bathroom was nice, but strangely the shower door opened inward and made it impossible to turn on the shower without standing under the cold water. The door completely blocked the knobs and needed some contortioning to reach around and get the water to the right temperature.

Once this was worked out, the pressure was good. The towels were not at all soft, but they were adequate.

Given that this was a ""Superior Room"", I wonder what you get for a standard room? It was late when I arrived and it was after a red-eye and meetings all day so I was in no condition to be complaining and changing rooms, I really just needed to sleep, and the room was very good for that. The bed was comfortable, and the room temperature was good with a good working thermostat. If I were traveling for leisure or had family with me I would have asked for a better room, but for this trip I just needed a comfortable place to sleep.

I didn't have much interaction with staff, but everyone I spoke to at the desk was very pleasant and they probably would have been very accommodating.",3,2011,12,15
115,"Excellent location, good service, couple of flaws","I stayed there last week (early Dec 2011) for four nights. The hotel is in an excellent location on the corner of Oxford St and Tottenham Court Road. You can realistically walk to most locations in the west end (theatres, shops, restaurants etc).

Hotel is very good quality - rooms, reception etc and merits it's TA rating. My rate included continental breakfast, which included a good variety of food and of good quality.

Customer service is generally very good and staff appear to genuinely want to help. My room was spotlessly clean every day and the house-keeping staff are top quality.

Couple of minor bugs: hotel room walls are pretty thin and if you have a loud(ish) neighbour, you're going to be able to hear everything they say. Phone system has just been upgraded (I was told) and therefore works sporadically (my phone kept flashing to say I had a message, but it was impossible to retrieve it).

I would stay there again.",4,2011,12,15
115,superb hotel wonderful staff,we stayed 2nights 11th and 12th dec ..staff amazing couldnt do enough for us so helpful..room wow thought i was going for relaxing break with partner but she had told staff she was planning proposal..room was upgraded and they went out of their way to make it special. suite was huge spotless and had everything you could possibly want/need really unable to fault such a lovely hotel all public areas were warm welcoming and spotless..fantastic area central london..needless to say i said yes to proposal and will no doubt be back at bloomsbury for our honeymoon cant think of anywhere nicer..late checkout offered and we were able to leave our cases there all day on day of check out until it was time for train home. thank you bloomsbury ....would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone,5,2011,12,14
115,Great location!,"Just back from great weekend in London and spent 1 night at the Bloomsbury! We had tickets for Jersey Boys at Prince Edward Theatre and the hotel is in a perfect location for this, only a 5-10minute walk away ;-) the hotel is in a gorgeous old building with high ceilings in reception and looks like lots of original features. We got a good deal on hotel from lastminute.com but otherwise it can be quite expensive for a night at the Bloomsbury. We got room only deal and were offered breakfast for &£15 extra if pre-booked or £21 the same day. However there are plenty of places nearby including Starbucks if you don't want to pay this if and if it's not included in your room deal. The rooms are modern in decor. We had seperate seating area and beds are really comfortable. Bathroom was quite small but well designed to provide everything you needed. The closet contained a safe, mini bar, coffee machine and tea facilities. The Lansdeer bar downstairs was nice but expensive (£13 for 2drinks). overall, great location and lovely clean hotel.",4,2011,12,12
115,Great Hotel - Great Price!,"This hotel has all the makings of a top notch, reasonably priced city centre hotel. The staff were very attentive and friendly. Check in was easy as was check out. My only gripe was the bar area. Why on earth have the bar stuck down in a dark basement? It was very small with low ceilings and panelled in wood. The bar staff were very warm and friendly, as was my champagne unfortunately! I would definitely stay again and really struggled to find anything wrong with this hotel.",4,2011,12,09
115,"Superb hotel, comfortable stay and first class service!","We stayed one night in the smallest room they have as unfortunately they were fully booked but despite the slightly cramped quarters we had an incredibly enjoyable saty. As above the staff were excellent particularly John barman and Katya at reception. They could not do enough to assist in all situations. The public areas have a warm and welcoming atmosphere, the decor is very tasteful and the cleanliness throughout is excellent. We ate in the bar in the evening, something we rarely do in London hotels, and had one of the best meals we have had for a long time and everything was more than reasonably priced.  Having been a fan of the County Hall Marriot for many years The Bllomsbury is our new hotel of choice in London.",5,2011,12,08
115,"Nice Hotel, Great Location, Nice Staff, but Oh My!","We stayed there three nights the weekend before Thanksgiving. Nice room, fabulous location, accommodating and super-pleasant staff. But that Sunday was so bad that it actually got us laughing after we stopped being put out. We left the room early enough to make a 10 AM church service across town at St. Margaret's (by Westminster Abbey). Then we came back to the British Museum, after lunch in a nearby pub -- an easy walk from the hotel. We got back to our room late afternoon to find that it hadn't yet been made up, though we saw a member of the housekeeping staff cleaning carpets in the hallway. We called housekeeping, and, since there was no answer, left a message that the room needed cleaning. After a half hour or so of no response, we decided to report the omission to reception (it was by now after 5 pm). The clerk there informed us that no one answered the phone in housekeeping on Sundays; so our message wouldn't have been picked up until Monday morning. 

We headed down to the bar, where we had had a pleasant couple of drinks the evening before. I discovered that the bar, which apparently doesn't stock my favorite gin, Tanqueray (the regular, not Tanqueray 10), was now out of the substitute I had ordered then, a local gin named Bulldog. We decided to eat at the bar; so I ordered lamb curry from the bar menu, and a Guinness with it. After a couple of minutes the waitress informed me that they were out of the curry; so I ordered fish and chips. Then she came by again to tell me that the bar was out of Guinness. Now the folks there were VERY nice. I can't complain about the attitude at all. In fact, I enjoyed our conversation with those working there. But really! They didn't have Tanqueray; they ran out of Bulldog; they ran out of lamb curry; and they ran out of Guinness. Who does the ordering? Who writes the menu? It was at that point that I started to laugh. It was a veritable comedy. I will say, though, that our room was ready for us when we got back to it. It simply shouldn't have taken so long.",3,2011,12,02
115,"Great location, ok rooms, miss on service","The Bloomsbury Hotel is a great location, really convenient, however with the construction on Oxford/Tottenham Court Roads it can make it challenging to get around.
The rooms were a nice size, however there are no clocks or any ihome-like device to play music etc. However I did find another sort of entertainment left on the top shelf of the room... porn magazines aimed at those interested in 50+ year old women!
From a service perspective, we called from our room to ask a variety of questions, including asking for some ice, which was delivered to our room with a £4 delivery charge. Our other calls were either never answered (including the operator) and we were not able to dial out of the hotel despite following the instructions in the room to a 't'.
We also met some family in the lobby and asked for a drink while we were catching up, there wasn't any issue with the ordering, however it took almost 30 minutes for the drinks to arrive.
I doubt I would return, as there are other London hotels that are much cheaper and would provide the same (if not better) experiences we had",3,2011,12,02
115,A nice hotel let down by the staff,Waited 30 minutes for a cocktail to be brought up to the lobby from the bar. Breakfast staff tried to clear before we were finished eating and housekeeping ignored the 'do not disturb' sign on the door. Very disappointing for a hotel of this stature,3,2011,11,30
115,Not what I expected,"This hotel is rated as a 4-star hotel.  And yet the service is so poor, I would rate it only a 2-star.  I gave it three, because the room was very nice and the hotel is in a good location.  Service problems were numerous: My first (and only) full day, my room had not been serviced by 3:30 p.m. and when I called reception, they said ""There's a turn down service at 6 p.m.""  When I insisted, they sent someone to clean my room.  When I went to the concierge desk to request a taxi, the conceriege told me that there was a taxi waiting for a guest to come down from theiur room and until the guest arrived, he couldn't help me.  I went out and got my own taxi.  The next night I called an hour before I needed the taxi to request one and was told to come down to the concierge desk 5 minutes before I needed the taxi.  When I did so, I was told that it would take 10-15 minutes to get a taxi!  The wind howled through the window in the bathroom, and the double pane window banged all night long.  I had to make 3 phone calls to get maintenance to put a shim in the window.

This is NOT the kind of service I expect at a 4-star hotel.  I wouldn't recommend this hotel as there are other hotles nearby (e.g. Radisson Edwardian) which have better service.",3,2011,11,29
115,Wonderful stay at this hotel!,"We stayed here for two nights with our little grand-daughter who had a very special interview to go to in London.  The staff were so friendly and helpful, that we felt we had family cheering her on! She ended up singing 'I think I'm gonna like it here' from Annie after the lovely welcome we got whilst checking in! She has got to the second round of the process - so thank you to all the staff who were so encouraging!  The hotel was simply first rate - great location for theatreland, Oxford Street, and everything else in Central London.  Tube Station a few yards away.  Lots of cafes and restaurants and even a small Sainsbury's.  British Museum very near too.  The hotel is designed in a subtle fusion of traditional and contemporary decor, and the public spaces are very welcoming and relaxing.  Our room was a good size for a central London hotel, spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished with a good supply of decent toiletries.  Everything in the room was well-maintained and in good working order.  Small point - perhaps a longer lead on the kettle?  We got a very good rate for our room and would certainly stay here again.  I can only echo all the other good comments about this hotel and cannot recommend it enough.  Well done Bloomsbury and your excellent staff.  We will be back!.........",5,2011,11,28
115,Great stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel,"We loved our stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel. Location is very good. Easy walking distance to Covent garden and Soho, and there are lots of good restaurants nearby. We asked to change our room after the first night as we were given a room very high up which I have a bit of problem sleeping in. Reception staff was very helpfull and we were given a room on the 3 floor. The room was very nice. It was clean and had all necessary equipment. Service was very friendly and polite. We will definitely use this hotel the next time we visit London.",5,2011,11,18
115,"Perfect Location, great service.","The hotel is in Bloomsbury but it is just 5 minutes walk to Soho square, the heart of Soho. British Museum is 2 minutes walk. I got a very good rate for my room compared to other hotels located in this beautiful area. The room was not big but spacious enough for London standards. I didn't like much the fact that the only window was difficult to open and it has no view on the streets but it's the only thing I didn't like. I stayed four days, the service has been always very good, they cleaned the room in the morning and came again in late evening to clean the room again and draw the curtains. One evening I returned to the room at 7 pm and went out for dinner at 9 pm, when I came back at 11 pm the room has been cleaned again, good! The people at the desk are very kind too without being oppressive, they don't ask to you if everything is fine 3 times a day, something I find often annoying.
The room had a very good and immediately working wi-fi internet, multiple outlets and a big HD TV. The bed was very comfy.",4,2011,11,15
115,lovely stay,"6 of us stayed here for 1 night on a theatre break. Hotel is very close to Tottenham Court Tube so very central and ideal location. Hotel is lovely, very clean and elegant. Lobby is very nice with candles lit all over which adds a nice atmosphere which is relaxed. 
Rooms were spotless, very well equipped and beds very comfy. Couldnt fault anything really. Breakfast was lovely too, again couldnt fault it. Only thing id say is we got a coffee and it was very expensive but hey you expect that when your in a hotel in Central London.
Would definately stay here again.",5,2011,11,14
115,Great treat for a birthday,"I had the most amazing stay at the bloomsbury hotel. It was a birthday treat from my partner and the staff couldnt be more accomodating. i was given a free cocktail at the bar and an upgrade to a suite. The cleanliness of the hotel is superb and the toiletries and Nespresso machine made the stay even more pleasurable. The bathroom had a tv, modern shower and bathrobes with slippers. 
The room was nicely decorated and had all the mod cons our stay required (plasma TV,coffee making facilities,hairdryer, lounge chairs,newspapers and magazines).

The mattress was very comfortable and we both slept soundly. We opted for a full english breakfast to be delivered to our room, it was delivered at our specified time and was warm and filling. There were no commercial pots of ketchup,cereal boxes like most hotels which was fabulous.

The hotel is a short walk from tottenham court road station and is easy reach of shops and the theatre. The staff are always willing to recommend restaurants and attractions in the area. The staff couldnt be more helpful if they tried. 

Overall i had a wonderful birthday in beautiful surroundings and it was definitely worth the money and time. Try the Mimosa cocktail in the Lansdeer bar..you wont be disappointed!",5,2011,11,13
115,"Lovely, Tranquil Hotel in the midst of Bustling London","This is a belated review coz we stayed at the Bloomsbury in July 2011. 

Initially we booked the superior rooms but later decided to upgrade to the deluxe rooms for the additional space. No regrets for this decision. We were assigned 2 lovely, quiet and ultra spacious rooms on the 6th floor. I have often heard that hotel rooms in London tend to be small. However, the rooms we were given were spacious! We couldn't even see the entrance door from our beds (partly because our room was L-shaped). 

I like the service staff here. They are warm, friendly, prompt and helpful. The general mood at the hotel was cozy, luxurious and warm. It's indeed a lovely place to return to after a long day of sightseeing. 

We love the location too. It's near the Westend theaters, Soho and many nice restaurants. The nearest underground station, Tottenham Court, is less than 5 minutes walk away. 

The only complaint I have is the drainage system of the shower stall area. Water tend to drain off slowly and as a result, the shower stall kind of floods easily.

Overall, we have enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to stay here again on our next visit to London.",4,2011,11,13
115,Hello London!!!,"London was the first stop on out trip to Europe.  We loved the hotel.  The staff was very nice.   There was a wedding going on so the put us on the 7th floor away from all the people and noise.  The room was great.  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was nice.  The hotel is clsoe to everything.  We are just within walking distance of music, food, and shopping.   We will stay here when we come to Londan again.",5,2011,11,12
115,Great place to Stay,"The position of this hotel is ideal for shows, shopping, pubs and food

Moreover, this hotel is up to date and classy. Staff are so pollished, frienly and helpfull. One little thing, I left the hotel in a hurry and by mistake left cash behind. Room service had been in and done a turn  down service. Everthing was in the exact place UNTOUCHED. Whilst it's what you'd expect this actually meant a lot to me

Air con was great

This is my favourite hotel!!  WELL DONE!! I'll be back",5,2011,11,07
115,Good hotel,"Good hotel but just a bit pricey.  Location was perfect for us, 2 minute walk from Tottenham Court Rod and a 15 minute walk from the Theatre district.

Room was warm and comfortable and decorated in a modern and contemporary style.  Breakfast was excellent although pricey.",4,2011,11,07
115,Great hotel great location,"Loved this hotel . We found our room very clean modern and comfortable. 
On arrival they gave us vouchers for cocktails . Which we took advantage. The price was quite competitive for London and location was spot on for us. 
My only moan was that isn't any parking and a warning there is a underground ncp car park 30 seconds away. But unless u have a mini it's a struggle to get down and once committed there's no going back. So watch your alloys.",4,2011,11,06
115,Great but expensive hotel,"Very good hotel, a small room but nice, luxurious furniture. Ideally situated, nearby Covent Garden and Soho. Breakfast was good and staff was nice.",4,2011,11,01
115,"Great Location, Great Hotel","If you love the British Museum, the British Library and walking to the shops and theaters of Covent Garden, this is a wonderful choice.  The location is near the Museum but far enough away to avoid the crowds entering it.  Catering to business people, the staff is serious and well trained.   The junior suite was an excellent size with an extremely generously sized bathroom, and specials are often offered for the junior suites, without breakfast. ( It would be wonderful if the hotel would offer breakfast with any rate, however, as it is still expensive even with the special rates.)

We did have some maintenance problems in our room, but the staff was very prompt in trying to fix them.  Kudos to the Guest Services Manager!  Cafe Rouge is around the corner on Tottenham Court Road for a reasonably priced and good breakfast in very pleasant surroundings if  breakfast is not included with your room price.",5,2011,10,31
115,Charming - Made to feel special,"Stayed here a few months ago but did not get round to leaving a review. I joined my partner who was visiting london on a course. The hotel feels very luxurious, all the staff are polite. The room was adequate, didn't have much of a view at all but that was ok. The bathroom was lovely too, it felt clean and the water got nice and hot quickly. Bed very comfortable, lovely complimentary bath robes too, big tv. The only negative of the room was that it was quite dark even with all the lights on so i had to go into the bathroom just to check i looked ok! Had a beautiful dinner in the restaurant (i can't remember the name) and the waiter was superb. I had the same dish for the 2 nights we were there but the second time round the portion was massive! its amazing what a conversation with a  waiter can do. The chef even came out and offered us a round of drinks! You don't often find that service especially as we are a couple in our early twenties. Drinks in the bar were expensive though so i wouldn't bother with that much! If breakfast hadn't of been included in the deal we got, i don't think i would have forked out for a cooked breakfast. I would have been tempted to find a cafe nearby but as it was, it was enjoyable. Great location for shopping and the tube. Would definitely stay here again!",4,2011,10,29
115,Comfortable In A Great Location,"We enjoyed our stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel.  Our room was small, but it was very nicely decorated with contemporary furnishings.  The bathroom was also small, but was modern and well appointed (it also had a heated floor, which was a nice touch).  The lobby and common areas of the hotel are very nice and charming.  

The service was fine - not amazing but adequate.  Even though it's a boutique hotel, it seems  to cater to a corporate clientele.  Our room rate included breakfast, which was ok.  They have a cold buffet and you can order hot items from the menu.  

Probably one of the best things about the hotel is the location - it's close to Soho and shopping on Oxford Street, and also has many restaurants and pubs located on the streets around the hotel.  While it's in the middle of everything, it's located on a quiet side street, which is nice.  Overall, I was satisfied with our stay.  Hotels in London are incredibly expensive, and we were able to get a pretty good rate, so it was a great value for the money.",4,2011,10,29
115,"Nice hotel, great location","Stayed October, 2011, for 11 days.  The room is adequate size, bed comfortable, if a bit soft for my taste.  Room was clean.  Linens replaced often.  Good flat screen TV.  Free WiFi, adequate speed.   Bathroom clean, well appointed, adequate size.  Good hot water, good shower fixtures and layout.  Room was very quiet and conducive to sleep (my biggest issue). 

Most staff were very helpful. 

Location is perfect for my tastes.  Very short walk to Tottenham Court tube, British Museum, Charlotte Street.  Easy walk to Covent Garden section, many good restaurants, some theaters, St. Paul's cathedral.  Easy tube connections to basically all attractions. 

Caveats.  Temperature control in my room was poor.  One could be too hot and then too cold several times in one night.  I have the impression that the climate control is just a poor design.   IMO, the breakfast was very overpriced.  Also, this hotel seems to be a popular wedding venue.  With the wrong choice of room you could have some fairly hefty noise problems. 

Overall, I would definitely stay here again.  The number 1 plus is the location - you are just off Tottenham Court Road and New Oxford Streets, but Great Russell St. itself is very quiet, and with proper choice of room you have no road noise whatsoever, complete silence.  The room itself is comfortable, and higher-end, but definitely not The Ritz.  The reality is that London hotel rooms are just really expensive.",4,2011,10,19
115,"Small room, disappointing breakfast, more effort please!","We stayed at the hotel for a wedding. The main areas of the hotel were...nice. The bar service was.....ok, nothing special. England is not known for its customer service and the bar service exemplified this. A few more smiles and a bit more eye contact wouldn't have gone amiss. The room again was..... ok. Nice toiletries, modern swish decor but pretty small, although I realise this is what you get for your money in central London. Breakfast was the most disappointing aspect. Stocks of many hot items (bacon, eggs etc) were not replenished in a timely manner at all, meaning several people were standing around waiting at the buffet. There were no plates or glasses for juice and despite several staff members walking around, I had to ask for these items. The hot breakfast was slightly greasy, a little nauseating. The cold selection was poor. Think cold meats slightly curled at the edges, sweaty cheese which had been sitting out for a long while.  The table service, though adequate, was delivered in slightly bored tones with few smiles and little eye contact. We stayed on Wall Street in New York earlier in the year. The hotel in New York cost less than The Bloomsbury, yet the contrast in customer service and quality of food couldn't have been more marked. Come on UK, let's not live up to our reputation for crap food and poor service! This hotel generally lived up to that, I'm sad to say.",3,2011,10,13
115,Work in progress,"I stayed one week at the Bloomsbury and loved its location. The restaurant is nice and breakfast is very good allowing you to order a la carte and/or buffet style. Only issue it was very warm, so not sure in the summer how comfortable it could be. I did not see AC.

The room in the 4th floor was boxy and small which is somehow more typical of UK hotels. the small window overlooked the next building so no views and rather dark. The bathroom was small but practical with nice marble all around. The aromatherapy shampoo, gel, etc. were very good and so were the towels.

My only compliant with the hotel is the door personnel. This hotel is not at street level so whe you arrive there is a flight of steep stairs to get to the main door, but nobody is there greeting you, so you end up having to unload your luggage from the taxi and go up the stairs with your luggage. I arrived at 7 pm on a Monday, so not sure what was the excuse. When I finally got there and opened the door, nobody came to offer help and the same after I checked in, nobody offer to take my luggage to my room... When I left the hotel was the same thing, I was  waiting in the lobby for my limo to the airport and advised the doormen (thee were there this time) to let me know when my car arrived. After 20 minutes I asked one of the guys and he told me that they would come in, when I replied how did he know and could he check if they were downstairs waiting, he motioned for me to go an check myself. I then insisted to please go outside and check and funny enough my limo was there waiting. I know it sounds petty, but this tells me about the training (lack of) in this establishment and if they had stars they would be a 3 to 4 star hotel at most, but prices do not reflect this at over 220 pounds a night (over 350 dollars). There is some work you need to do to make this hotel good. There is potential but you need to care more.",3,2011,10,10
115,High potential - with a few glitches,"Great location near Covent Gardens, Soho etc.  short walk to most places. The rooms were large and modern - new, clean - we were really pleased when we first walked in. (Appeared to be a solid 4+ star at first). Our shower faucet only provided cold water - there was an issue with the tap. Despite 3 calls down and a 2 visits from maintenance we never did use the shower or have warm water! (Had to sit in the bath and use the hand spray - what a pain) No offer to change rooms. The lights in the closet and Nespresso machine never worked, (that did get fixed day 2). There appeared to be a lot of maintenance issues in the hotel in general - we heard guests at reception complaining about over flowing and backed up toilets. We also heard about people complaining about strange smells. I think this hotel has a build qualiy and plumbing issue in general - these were not 'one offs'. I might stay here again - but it would have to be a 'deal' AND I'd check the room quickly before I unpacked. Get a new room (if available) if there is a problem.",4,2011,10,03
115,"Very nice hotel, got a pretty good deal","We took advantage of a deal the Bloomsbury was having and got one of their corner suites for £225.  That's expensive (especially when you're paid in USD), but actually a pretty good deal for a suite in central London.

The suite was very nice and a mini-bottle of wine was waiting for us with a hand-written welcome message.  The large bed was very comfy and the television was *enormous*, which came in handy when my wife got ill and we spent most of three days walled up in the hotel.

The location is fantastic, with tube access right around the corner, a pharmacy at the end of the block, many good restaurants nearby, etc.

I only had two small complaints: 
- There was a worker painting the walls on our floor one day and it smelled really bad
- The housekeeping staff did not obey the Do Not Disturb tag on the door.  When we hung it out, they would knock anyway, and even twice called us on the room phone to ask if they could come in and clean our room!  +1 for *really* wanting to clean our room, but sheesh.  Do Not Disturb means Do Not Disturb.",4,2011,09,28
115,We loved this hotel and it's location,"This hotel is superb for exploring central london, near to Oxford Street, Covent Garden and Soho.  The hotel was luxurious, our room was a little on the small side but the lovely decor and fantastic service made up for it.  All staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  They even tidy your room before bedtime and get your bed ready for you.  We got a great deal through superbreaks but we will defintaley be back to stay here again.  Also the British Museum is a 2 minute walk and worth a visit.",5,2011,09,27
115,"Great location, staff and hotel but our room wasn't great","We had a great experience at the Bloomsbury Hotel.  The location, staff and hotel in general was perfect.  Our room on the other hand was a little ""off"".  There was a very weird smell when you entered that very well could have been urine.  We also had no view at all and the shower had no water pressure.  But with all of that said, I would return because everything else great.",4,2011,09,23
115,One of the best!,"My wife and I stayed here last weeks for two nights on our honeymoon - it was simply wonderful. We had mentioned when booking that we were there for a special occasion, and they really did pull out all the stops. I can't thank the staff there enough for making our stay amazing. 
Our room (415) was nothing short of luxuriant. The style and  furnishing were lovely. The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was stylish, modern and spotlessly clean. 
One night we had our evening meal in the restaurant there and it was very tasty. Because of a minor problem with the plug in our shower we got a free desert or starter course. The shower was sorted no problems and the desert was excellent. We then had some drinks in the bar - the staff there were very friendly, as were all the staff we dealt with. In the mornings we had breakfast in the restaurant, and once again, it was great. 
I can highly recommend afternoon tea at the Bloomsbury. We went back for an aftenoon at the end of our trip having just returned from Paris. We were overwhelmed by tea, sandwiches and cakes. Happy times!
For our honeymoon break this was the perfect place to stay. To the staff - thankyou so much, we were made to feel very special indeed.",5,2011,09,21
115,Missing some basics,The room is small but well appointed. Show a similar care of design you'll find in Japanese hotels. This is good. But the bed is a bit sagging and the minibar is not replenished on Sundays. The water in the shower is so hot it is barely possible to shower. Even at the lowest temp setting. ,3,2011,09,18
115,"Nice, clean with friendly staff.","My partner and I stayed in room 214 for 2 nights, the room its self was ""cosy"" very clean and well appointed, the bathroom was also pretty good. The bed was ok, crisp and clean white cotton sheets, it was a little soft for my liking, it was like being eaten by a giant marshmallow, some of you will love it, I prefer a harder matress. There wasnt any veiw to speak of and late at night it became a little niosy outside the window, not a problem if you sleep with the windows closed.The public areas in the hotel were also of a good standard and pleasant to be around, the only thing that did not match the standard of the hotel was the Landseer Resturant, we found it to be poorly lit and the decor looked dated, with the exception of breakfast which was very good, the food in the evening wasnt to our liking, however, the starters were ok, the staff were very attentive and proficient, overall we think you would be better off eating out, we ate at the Tas resturant 2 minutes walk up the road, very clean and decent food, 2 starters+ 2 mains and a bottle of wine £65.
We enjoyed the hotel and liked the location which give easy walking to Oxford Street/Covent Garden and will most likely return.",4,2011,09,18
115,Comfortable Rooms and Excellent Value,"I stayed here for four nights and really enjoyed my stay. I would rate the hotel as ""Excellent"" were it not for a few hiccups at check-in.

The location is a reasonable walk from Holborn (if taking tube from Heathrow) and a hop, skip and a jump from Tottenham Court Road. Much of central London is within walking distance. There is a flight of stairs to get to the front door, but doormen are on hand to assist guests with baggage.

Upon arrival I was upgraded to a deluxe room - it had a king size bed, a spacious bathroom with tub, a TV and a kettle. There was very little noise and everything was very clean and maintained to a good standard.

The only criticism was that my room was not ready on time. I had requested an early check-in, and unfortunately the room wasn't ready. So, I left my bag and returned to the hotel after 2pm (check-in time). My room was still not ready and I was lefting standing at the desk for too long. Finally a decision was made to upgrade my room (to a room that was ready!) and I could check-in and get settled. At a hotel of this level I would have expected the room to be ready on time, or so the decision to change my room to be made quicker. To the benefit of the staff, they did send a half bottle of wine to my room, so that was greatly appreciated.

I would stay here again if there were similar on-line specials for the rate.",4,2011,09,17
115,Great hotel in a great location,"The reviews for this hotel were very good and based on them, I reserved it on the hotel website.
I spent four nights there with my husband a week ago and we loved the hotel. In our next trips to London, we would definitly stay there.
The room is quite big for european standards and so does the bathroom, with a very confortable heated floor. The decor is very nice and everything is brand new.
They have a good in-room safe, a very good hair-dryer (important thing to me!), as well as a eletric water boiler with assortment of teas and coffees and a small biscuit refilled every day. On the day we arrived, we even had a small bottle of wine welcoming us.
The room was always very clean, the cleaning lady came twice a day, what made our room always impecable.
The staff is great, everyone was pretty nice to us, from the porter to the concierge.
The location is great, one block to Oxford Street and to the tube station and you can go easily walking to lots of tourist spots in town.
I would definitly recommend this hotel to anyone who goes to London.",5,2011,09,15
115,Great value,"I am a frequent business traveler and have spent at least a night in six different London hotels in 2011 alone.  It is not a 5-star property, although in many respects it could be confused as such.  The rooms are well-furnished, attractive, and comfortable.  The service was excellent.

Some of the small touches were missing that you find at luxury properties, but I would consider the Bloomsbury to be the best value I have found.

Note:  I did pay to upgrade to a deluxe room, which had a seating area.  The room was more spacious than other upgraded rooms I have had.",5,2011,09,12
115,Good hotel in an excellent location,"A personal hotel with a great location, close to Soho, Picadilly and tons of great shopping. Room was quite small but well eqiupt and clean. Staff was helpful and friendly. The bar in the basement is great!",4,2011,09,12
115,Not sure....,"Overall the hotel is lovely, very friendly, helpful staff and clean rooms.

Only issue is, we only stayed the one night and we went out for a few hours. When we returned someone had been in our room and moved a few things around. Made us feel very uneasy as nobody should have been in there.",4,2011,09,11
115,Impressed,"I've been traveling to london frequently for work. I stayed at the Bloomsbury (by chance the first time) and i was very pleased with the experience. Since then, this is my hotel of choice. The hotel is very nice, but what makes it special is the staff! Everyone is expremely professional and polite. But special kudos go to Adnan. He is a star! He gets hospitality like nobody else! He is very polite, always attentive, super smart and solves any problem in a minute. My only wish, is that Olga would still be working there!",5,2011,09,08
115,"Really liked it, definitely will return","September prices for my usual hotel in London soared recently so I looked around for an alternative. The Bloomsbury location is very central and I had a superb room although I am not sure that all rooms are of this standard..
Staff are extremely attentive. Say hi to Eoin, the Food and Beverage manager, a young man with that ancient hotelier skill of remembering everything about his customers. 
I believe I have a new ""usual hotel"" in London.

Kieran O'Brien",5,2011,09,08
115,lovely hotel will definately stay there again,"Having stayed in london a few times for theatre trips etc & stayed in different hotels we have never found one where we would go back until we stayed here. It was a lovely hotel,Very plush & clean. Staff couldnt do enough for you. Very close to everything. When we arrived there was a complimentary bottle of wine in the room which was a nice touch.We did eat in the restaurant at night which again was nice & breakfast was lovely the following morning.
We would definately recommend this hotel to friends & family.",4,2011,09,06
115,"A Wonderful Hotel in a Magnificent Location, with Exceptional Staff.","Literally a two minute walk from Tottenham Court Road tube station this hotel was wonderful. The moment we stepped into The Bloomsbury Hotel we were made to feel extremely welcome by Brian the concierge-whose knowledge of the area proved extremely useful to us later on- Check in was quick and efficient.
Our room was spotlessly clean and featured all the mod cons - mini bar, hairdryer, iron/ironing board, espresso coffee machine, flat screen TV and an exceptionally comfortable queen size bed. 
At breakfast every morning we were greeted by Maria who looked after us impeccably, breakfast was presented well and cooked perfectly.  The al a carte restaurant was also well worth the visit on Saturday night, we both ordered succulent sirloin steaks cooked to perfection by the chef, prices were also competitive for the area.  Eoin our server made this a dining experience with his smiling face and witty charm.
Sights we visited on our three day visit that were within easy reach of the Bloomsbury; the British Museum a three minute walk from the Hotel, Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square, History Museum, Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament, London Eye, Buckingham Palace where we seen the Changing of the Guards ceremony, Hyde James and Green Park.  
We even went to see We Will Rock you at the Dominion Theatre, which is just around the corner from the Hotel.
Shopping is top of my to do list next time we visit this Hotel. 
Overall; A wonderful Hotel in a magnificent location with Exceptional staff. What more can I say The Bloomsbury Hotel has the full package.",5,2011,09,06
115,"Great Package, Excellent Location","We spent 3 nights here, whilst exploring the ""culinary"" delights of Soho and central London.  The room was gorgeous, the beds really comfortable, the brekkie was average, but the staff were fantastic.  Be sure to meet Gasper in the bar on your way back to your room - he is great craic.  We were on a great package, including breakfast - ask for the deal on the day.  I would like to suggest that the hotel staff could be a little more knowledgeable of their surroundings - restaurants, streets, and tourist destinations.  Be sure to dine at Gauthier's when you stay here - it is the most memorable of our dining experiences.  Thanx to all the staff, including Eion.  See you again soon.  Lin and Bobby.",5,2011,09,02
115,Very nice hotel with a great location,"Check in was very positive...everyone friendly and efficient.  Offered us tea or lemonade while our reservations were completed.  We stayed 5 days and were very pleased.

Room was nice, squeeky clean.  Bed was comfortable with high quality linens.  Small desk, good sized flat screen TV, very fast internet included in rate.  

Location was very good, about a block from the London Museum (free!).  And there are some fun pubs a couple of minutes walk.  Also, two blocks from a number of electronics stores to get your wires, plugs, adaptors at good rates.

Bathroom was small with a shower over the tub.  Several confusing knobs to fill the tub, activate the sprayer, or the shower and temperature were eventually negotiated.

We had a view of an airwell, but the window did open.  AC was efficient and fairly quiet but fan on low was present.

Room lighting was confusing to operate, with switches controlling several fixtures.  Bathroom lighting was poor, just a two small spotlights in the ceiling.  One was above the sink and that made it near impossible for my wife to apply makeup as her face was in shadow.

We had paid for the continental breakfast to be included an it was delightful.  Dozens of choices, great ham, pastries, fruit, coffee, tea, toast, smoked salmon, cheeses including a nice brie, etc.  Juices  were great.  You can also order your breakfast prepared or delivered to your room for an extra cost.

We had dinner at their restaurant.  Service was excellent, food was good.  The bar was fun with a very accomodating bartender.",5,2011,08,28
115,Very solid Hotel in great  location,"Visited the Bloomsbury Hotel at the end of July. It is superbly located, especially if you want to be near the Dominion Theatre as we did. It is also only a very short walk from the British Museum. The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable, the buffet breakfast consisted of a variety of hot and cold food well presented. It’s not cheap but well worth the money considering the location. We arrived after check in time but the room was not ready, we were seated in the bar area and offered a complimentary cocktail, frankly it was ok but no way would I have paid £15 for one! Would I go back? Sure I would.",4,2011,08,27
115,Good Hotel,"Stayed here on the way to paris, room only.  A bit pricy at 220 quid..  Nice room, friendly staff, great location.  Good but small gym - no water in the gym!  On the flip side we were offered a bottle of water each on the way in and on the way out in the morning.  Bath screen allows the floor to flood a bit but then don't they all! Bed comfey.  Great coffee machine.   We would definitey stay here again.",4,2011,08,23
115,A fabulous time!,"This is our second visit to The Bloomsbury Hotel and I have to say that we loved it even more the second time around.  Don't get me wrong, the first time was FABULOUS - we were really looking forward to coming back to London, and upon our arrival we were treated very special (as they treat all of their guests).  The rooms are fabulous, the staff very very attentive to your needs and the addition of all the other hotel guests that we met at the end of the evening around the bar, to talk about all of our adventures of the day made it a wonderful stay.  Not to mention the very tasty drinks and wonderful conversation that were made by our fave bartender, Gasper.  We will definitely be coming back next summer and are hoping we will be able to secure a room as the Olympics are there and we will definitely be going!  Thanks to everyone who made our stay wonderful, we appreciate the kindness very much!  Alex Anguiano & Cathi Nunn",5,2011,08,22
115,Wonderful location,"My fiancee and I stayed here during the first week of July, 2011.  It was my first time in London, and nearby the college (UCL) where my fiancee spent a semester abroad, so she knew the neighborhood quite well.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  Due to reasons far beyond our control, we arrived a full 24 hours late.  But we had been able to call ahead to alert them to our delay, and they were very understanding.  To help ease the inconvenience of our LA-London flight, they presented us with two free drink chits upon check-in.  A nice touch, though our flight woes had nothing to do with the hotel.  The room was small, but very comfortable.  We had a view of an interior airshaft, but that was fine since we were in the city to explore.  A nice feature of the room's location was that we were able to sleep in well past a 4:30am sunrise since the airshaft prevented it from getting too bright.  We walked nearly everywhere, and the two times we didn't, the Tottenham Court Rd tube stop was a quick 3 minute walk.  Its great central location made accessing the major attractions quite easy.  We had a number of fantastic meals in nearby Soho.  And after checking out, we had 90 minutes to kill before we needed to head to Paddington Station to grab the express to Heathrow, so we walked down the street to take in the Rosetta Stone a few other fine rooms at the British Museum!  All in all a wonderful introduction to London for me!  Easily a place I'd return to!",5,2011,08,19
115,"Love, love, love!!! :)","We love the hotel and everyone who works there! It may sound exaggerated but I think we hit a jackpot with this place.  Having gone thru several different hotels that are part of a tour group - to have to stay in a place that provides real tranquil and great amenities are a welcome treat!

It all started when we were choosing our accommodations while back home in Canada.  I emailed another hotel thru a friend's recommendation but never heard back. The Bloomsbury Hotel concierge (Paolo) though - responded with quick, accurate, complete replies! Wow! (I was inquiring about hotel transfer from Bloomsbury to Heathrow and got a great, quick reply).  I was stressing about this before because we are hauling 4 luggages from the tour and we still have a convention to attend to in the US - so the replies are awesome and makes for easier planning.  We booked with them without hesitation.

When we checked in that day, we were extremely early (we were just transferring from Westminster to Bloomsbury as our tour concluded that day) but they said we can go in our room now.  Wow, how's that for service?!!?  We got the doorman help us with the luggages and was just too delighted to see a very inviting room - well decor-ed and with airconditioning too. Great bathroom amenities as well and a turndown evening service too! Imagine that! :)

The breakfast buffet too was awesome.  Maria and Maria Estelita are great servers.  They make sure you get everything you need!  

Free wi-fi all over the hotel, great location (everyone mentioned about the tube being closeby) and close to Covent Garden as well! What's not mentioned too is the free printing of the e-tickets too.  Many hotels charge for that. 

I always believed that great service starts from having great staff. And Bloomsbury Hotel has awesome people! Thank you so much.  We will definitely go back to your hotel when we are in London!",5,2011,08,14
115,Very nice Hotel,"We stayed a couple of nights in the Bloomsbury and took in a couple of West End Shtows. The hotel is well located - near British Museum, Oxford St, West End Theatres etc.
Very professional front office staff who are very helpful and knowledgable. Rooms are modern, very clean and are large compared to the norm in London. Not the cheapest of course and the breakfast at £20 is a tad too high. Nonetheless a great stay and highly recommended.",4,2011,08,12
115,"Great hotel, great service, perfect location at a great price","I found this place because of the great reviews and all the great reviews are true!  The hotel is located 5 minutes from the metro stop and near a ton of restaurants and anything you could want to do.  The room was modern, bathroom was very nice, room was comfortable and affordable.  The concierge was super helpful in terms of giving us great restaurants, things to see & exact directions on how to get there.  They even let us have a small refrigerator for our room at no cost.  They also gave us 2 free drinks at the bar.  I would highly recommend this hotel because it has a great price, great rooms and great service.",5,2011,08,10
115,Disapointing,"We have stayed in many London hotels over the last 20 years. This time we decided to go for something more grand. And booked a superiour room in The Bloomsbury. Special deal, three nights for nearly 600 euros,this is without breakfast.On paper it looks fantastic. And when we arrived it feld like we were in the movies, cab doors opened and suitcases brought up to reception before we could even blink our eyes. Checked in, and  by the time we opened our hotel room door, we  came back to reality and found that the room was the useal small London hotel room, but this one was also very dark, with hardly any  naturel light coming in, as it was on a small awfull looking service courtyard. We had to refuse this room and the next, till we was offered a slightly bigger room, with stained carpet, and a window on a backstreet. But the bed is very comfy, if you can get some sleep, paperthin walls. We was in and out of the hotel lots off time but the doorman must have had the weekend off. Hardly saw them. On checkout,we weeled our suitcases down the steps ourselfs, luckely the steps are not very high. And yes, it is clean, but that is the least to expect. And it is in the area we wanted to be in, but he,so is the YMCA:-).",3,2011,08,09
115,Really wanted to like this hotel but just can’t.,"Air-conditioner made a lot of noise. The mattresses were soft (not in a good way). Pedal bin didn’t work properly; I had to use my hands to get it open. No fridge. And weird wiring stuff visible through the ceiling. As with many hotels in London, space is limited, and the dark furniture adds to the claustrophobic feel. 

But having said all that, the hotel has one of the nicest decors I’ve ever seen. Loved the use of Aromatherapy Associated products (who doesn’t?). Oh yes, WIFI is free.

Tottenham Court Road's tube station is about two minute walk away. It is not my favourite area in London, but considering how cheap the hotel is, you can’t really complain that much. Plus, the lovely and lively Charlotte Street is quite close.",3,2011,08,06
115,Very Plush!  We wouldnt stay anywhere else in London,"What an amazing hotel,   Only a 25 minute stroll from Kings Cross Station and a shart taxi ride.  From the outside the hotel looks amazing and the inside is even better.  The staff were more than helpful and very friendly.  The rooms are spacious and very well presented.  If you are seeing a show we would suggest having your evening meal in the hotel resteraunt.  The food is divine and they do a special offer for those seeing a show.  The service was excellent and the setting was very romantic.  We asked if we could have a late check out and this was free of charge.  When we visit London again we will most definately stay here again.  The hotel is only a short walk from Oxford Street and also the main theatres.Would definately recommend this hotel",5,2011,08,05
115,Great hotel. Great Location.,"We stayed here for 6 nights recently (well 4 of 6 so far).  It's great!  It's clean, the rooms are of a good size, the location is superb and the value is amazing.

Being adjacent to Soho and Covent Garden, there is an unlimited amount to do within a 10-minute walk.  Food, shopping, sights, Underground - everything.

The beds are great.  Bathrooms are newly renovated. Flatscreen TVs. FREE WIFI throughout the hotel!!

We are in an 8th floor room and we have skylights instead of windows, but they have shades on them that cut out all the light when drawn, so it's pitch black for sleeping (great for overcoming jet lag and napping).   This particular room would be bad for anyone wanting a view, but we don't care in the least.

The room is well air-conditioned and despite being on the top floor is not hot.

The lounge in the basement is well-stocked and run by a knowledgeable bartender.

The negatives are: the doors are thin and you can hear everything that goes on in the hall.  That said, we've got great floor mates, so have only really been bothered once.  I would imagine a rowdy group would make for a sleepless night.

At the moment the North line on the Tube does not stop at Tottenham Court Road because the station is being re-built.  This is beyond the control of the hotel, but it means most southerly trips have to be routed through Oxford Circus, so add a few more minutes to your travel time.  The ground-level area around the station is also under heavy construction and there is a bit of a detour to continue south at the intersection of Tottenham Court and New Oxford St (again not a big deal, but keep your maps handy).

We'll definitely stay here again.",5,2011,08,05
115,NIce hotel but our 2nd choice in this part of London.,"We stayed at The Bloomsbury Hotel in April for a Friday and Saturday night.  We had stayed in Bloomsbury last year and really liked the area for its easy walk to such areas as Covent Garden and Leicester Square.   We had hoped to return to the Radisson Edwardian Bloomsbury Street hotel again this year but they could not accommodate us for both nights of our stay.  As I had walked by this hotel several times and loved the looks of the building and the lobby we decided to give it a try. We got an excellent rate on the hotels own website of £131.00 per night including VAT. This was for a superior room with one queen bed.   

When we arrived at the hotel the door staff directed my husband to the NCP car park which was a block away from the hotel.  I was surprised they didn't offer to valet park the car like the hotel last year did. The rate for parking was £30.00 per day. 

On checking in we were given a room which turned out to be at the back of the hotel. It was very dark with just a tiny window in one corner, (room 611).  I asked to be moved and without any trouble we got a room facing the front of the hotel on an upper floor with a much bigger window, (room 524).  This was much brighter.  It was nicely decorated and very clean.  The bathroom was nice too although very small.  

The front desk staff were all friendly and helpful. The door staff was also great about providing us with parking tips and assistance when we were checking out and needed to park near the hotel to load the luggage. 

We did not eat in the restaurant as breakfast was not included in our rate. I did think the little outside seating area looked inviting. 

The location was good.  It was slightly closer to Tottenham Road tube station but a bit further to walk to Covent Garden.
 
I am not sure how old the building is but the rooms are a bit of a maze to get to with a lot of interesting twists and turns.  It has been nicely restored and redecorated. 

Overall we were not unhappy with our stay but if we visit this part of London again I would hope to get back into the Radisson Edwardian Bloomsbury.",4,2011,08,01
115,"Very professional, clean, good location & very comfortable...","Room: we stayed at the Bloomsbury for 3 nights in a deluxe room which was very comfortable, quite spacious and very quiet (it was on the 5th floor).  The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever experienced & extremely large too.  The room was decorated in a modern but discreet/low-key fashion - quite relaxing.

Staff: they were unfailingly polite and helpful from check-in to check-out and all points between.  We didn't rely on them too much but, even for our modest queries, they were polite and pleasant at all times.

Location: at first, we felt a little off the beaten track but that was more to do with our general lack of familiarity with London.  In fact, the hotel is just 5 minutes walk from Covent Garden and 10 minutes from Soho.  (Incidentally: Soho recommendations include Spuntino, Mildreds and Fernandez & Wells).

Price: okay, it's not at the budget end of the spectrum.  We paid 175 pounds sterling for the room for each night PLUS VAT.  This last bit caught me unawares.  When I booked, I mistakenly assumed the 175 was the all-in price - not so; the extra 20% VAT on checkout was a surprise.  But, overall, I still feel it represented very good value in terms of location, service & comfort (maybe that's just me experiencing some cognitive dissonance and rationalising after-the-fact!).

Other: I really liked the availability of the Irish Times each day in the lobby - nice touch; the free wifi was also appreciated and the bottles of water on departure.  Yes, I know these all go into the price but, still, they are nice touches.

PS: get the London open-top bus tour (red & yellow routes are best) - I was a determined skeptic about this but it was 200% enjoyable and informative - history was never so engaging.",4,2011,08,01
115,WOW!,"My brother was graduating in Nov 2010. My husband and I together with our 3 yr old son travelled to London to attend the.graduation ceremony which was being held at the barbican hall. Since we had lived in London for some yrs, we decided to ask some of our old time friends who were still in London if they could meet us for dinner, to catch up. 
We had to stay in a centralised location  and WOW! Aren't we glad we chose the Bloomsbury Hotel!! Tottenham court rd/central line was the closest tube station which is a  very short walk away from the hotel. Oxford st.(where all the main high street shops and some are located) was about 3 minutes walk so we managed to do some serious shopping! We were spoilt for choice when it came to lunch/ dinning because there were so many restaurants  and fast food shops which were walking distance which meant that we didn't have to  pay for cabs and all. Everything was super,but the best of all was the hotel! The room was LARGE enough for the three of us, super clean and comfortable. I particularly loved the small flat screen tv in the bathroom! The staff was fab! they were v. friendly especially to our son. On our first day when we were waiting to check in, they  gave him  an art pack so he could keep busy colouring and painting. I highly recommend this hotel for families travelling with children and will definately be back in the near future!",5,2011,08,01
115,Wonderful Hotel in London,"My daughter and I recently stayed at the Bloomsbury in London.  The location, for us, was perfect.  It is very close to the British Museum and Covent Gardens on a quiet street.  The room (401) was immaculate with comfortable beds, a safe, heated bathroom floor with a full tub and separate shower stall, air conditioning and free WiFi.   This room was not facing a road and did not have a view but that was not important for our stay, it was quiet and that was a plus for us.   The staff was very welcoming and the breakfast featured many fresh fruits as well as hard boiled eggs, meats, cheese, yogurt, cereals and pastries.  I would definitely choose to stay at the Bloomsbury again.",5,2011,07,31
115,excellent location with efficient friendly staff,"Without exception the staff were welcoming, knowledgeable and efficient.  They all remembered my name, and used it.  The location was perfect.  The only improvement would be a useable frig in the room.",5,2011,07,31
115,Great hotel and excellent location,"A great hotel in an excellent location. A  very relaxing stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel. Liked the little details, candles burning in the reception, Aromatherapy Associates bath products and excellent polite staff. The only negative thing was food and drinks were very expensive but then again it is London.",4,2011,07,29
115,Comfortable and perfect location,Right in the middle between business and leisure; comfortable hotel and stylish rooms. The room service High Tea was excellent!,4,2011,07,29
115,"Perfect location, perfect pillows","I picked the Bloomsbury Hotel for its location only a block from the British Museum and because I wanted some comfort as well. It was also easy walking distance to the three different theaters I attended, as well as to Covent Garden. I splurged on a suite, as the hotel was having a special on suites, and I felt that it lived up to its billing. There were some nice touches, such as warm tiles on the floor in the bathroom. The bed was very comfy, and the room felt cheery to come back to after a long day of sight-seeing. It was pricier than I am accustomed to, but I felt that it was worth the splurge because of the comfort and location.",4,2011,07,29
115,A very fine hotel,"We stayed there this past week in a studio suite.  We were very satisfied.  The hotel is well-located, two blocks from the British Museum on a side street around the corner  from a tube station on Tottenham Court Road, which is a lively shopping area.  There are good restaurants, bars and shops nearby.  While the hotel's exterior is unprepossessing, the lobby and reception area are elegant and have several very comfortable sitting areas.  We had breakfast in the restaurant, which was quite good, and drinks several evenings at the Bar, which remained open until after midnight, where the service was friendly.  The suite was spacious and well-furnished with a king-sized bed,  desk and couch, side tables, a large flat screen tv and large closet, although little drawer space.  The bathroom is large with a separate shower and free-standing tub, and the fixtures are new and of good quality.  The A/C worked well.  We thought the service was generally very good.  Since we were arriving in the morning we asked for early check-in.  When we arrived at around 11:00, our room was ready.  We would stay there again.",5,2011,07,27
115,Simply outstanding,"FRom the moment we walked through the door you felt the difference - the welcoming smile at reception , the attentive porter , the fresh and oh so tasty snacks , the clean, fresh bedroom completed simply by a very healthy breakfast - yes all this in a LOndon hotel - truly amazing !!!",5,2011,07,27
115,Bad News,"Air conditioning stuck on cold. Called for repair 3-4 times on check in. First sloughed off then told it can’t be fixed. Moving to anotgher room may have same result. Spent much of first day trying to repair this room. Stuffed drains, had to call for bathrobe, slippers, glasses, towels, maybe more. Screwed up[ bill on departure. Restaurant extremely expensive but good for dinner. Not enough theatre for the price. Manager full of himself gave us a 30% discount plus free dinner. Not worth the aggravation.",2,2011,07,23
115,Great Hotel for Business,Stayed there last year for a business purpose and  the room is good and comfortable. Charging for wireless internet access is now acceptable anymore,4,2011,07,21
115,Welcome sanctuary - was like coming home each day.,"Best welcome to a hotel during our 3 week trip by brendon at check-in. Tasteful room - 601- comfy beds- shame about the missing blind from one window. Appreciated the ironing board so don't have to pay pressing charges:) and free wi-fi, quality toiletries.  Getting a cab can be hard at times- sometimes there were 2 conceirges on and then none at other times-  couldn't figure that  out- but short walk to cross street to wave one down- wouldn't want to do that in winter though:) as always, it is the small things that make a stay memorable and the highlight of our stay was Monica at breakfast. Monica enquirer how did we enjoy our pancakes - we replied lightheartedly that they were 
delicious if a little small. Was 
nothing really major-but Monica 
thanked us for our feedback and 
promised she would personally see 
to it that we received a larger serve
 the next morning- which she  did plus she did not charge us- which 
was just so sweet and appreciated.
 We were just thinking about the 
larger serve and had forgotten 
about the offer of not charging- but Monica was true to her word. We had not even asked for it.  Example of someone thinking from the customer's view but taking it up a notch- a true hospitality professional.",5,2011,07,21
115,a lovely hotel,"we have just stayed at the bloomsbury hotel and combined it with a trip to see les miserable. what a lovely hotel. our room was very nice and the bed was even turned down . i havnt seen that sort of service for years.
we were on the 6th floor and it was really quiet. the breakfast was excellent although a bit pricey at £15. the pre dinner meal at £18 each was good value and included 2 courses and a good sized glass of wine. it was a wet weekend and we spent more time in the room than usual but it was very comfortable and i would definately stay here again.",4,2011,07,18
115,"comfortable in any way, friendly staff, cool design, quiet, but ""grey"" area.","Fantastic bed, small room, no view, but big and modern bathroom. Beatiful lobby with nice personel and athmosphere.",4,2011,07,16
115,Great Business Hotel - very good staff,"Our firm chooses this hotel for all our trips to London. We take about 30 bed nights a year minimum and are always impressed. I also stay here once or twice a year for a weekend away with my wife and we have never had a problem

Check in is always friendly and efficient and the rooms (some are a little small but not uncomfortably so) are well appointed with good bathrooms and very comfy double beds even in ""single rooms""

Breakfast is very good but there is no real natural light in the dining room (basement level) so it takes a while for your eyes to adjust.

The bar downstairs is nice and intimate and the Guinness is good (as it is an Irish hotel). The limited bar menu is actually very good value.

Location is great because it is a short walk of the West End and Soho.",4,2011,07,15
115,"Great location, friendly staff","Stayed just one night, and in all honesty cannot fault the location. Literally seconds from Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street, but set on a quiet street you can't complain at all about the central position!

The staff, from the moment they open the door to welcome you, through concierge, reception, wait etc are all of first rate quality. When I checked out, I was offered a bottle of water to take with me as well which was a nice thing (maybe my dehydrated state made them feel sorry for me, or maybe it was just standard fare - either way, it was a great touch!)

With free wi-fi throughout the hotel (a GREAT touch) and a comfortable foyer, the hotel has a lovely feel to it. Unlike lots of hotels I have stayed in, if you just want to take the load off your feet and pick up a newspaper and unwind a little, you are not pressured by any staff member trying o force coffee or scones down you.

The room I stayed in was very oddly shaped which meant the TV was hidden away almost around a corner. I would argue that if 2 were in the bed that one probably wouldn't be able to watch it!  The bathroom did have speakers linked to the TV though so you could hear what was going on, even if you couldn't see it!

The toiletries in the room were of a high standard (same as in the Mandarin Oriental New York) and the room also possessed robes, a safe, an ironing board and iron. The desk by the side of the bed was large and had enough plug sockets to run a small office. In my book that's a great thing - consider a laptop, mobile etc.

The bed was large and incredibly comfortable.

My room, 7th floor,  had one smallish window which looked out onto a brick wall, but it shone light into the room in enough quantity and didn't bother me.

Didn't eat at the restaurant for dinner, or take breakfast so cannot quote.

There is an NCP literally 50 yards away should you be foolish enough to want to drive into the centre of london and pay exhorbitant rates for parking. Shopping is literally around the corner, theatres are moments away (The Dominion Theatre - We Will Rock You) is less than 90 seconds away. Restaurants, bars, casino's etc a stones throw.

Would stay there again without a second thought.",4,2011,07,11
115,Nice hotel just not amazing,"We stayed for one night with friends after attending an event at Hyde Park.  Location was good as was near enough to Hyde Park that you could walk and take a look at all the shops on the way.  The room was what you would expect and was clean and comfortable.  A breakfast buffet was included with the price and we enjoyed our meal.

Couple of snags.  We had trouble with our key cards, they didn't work once and we had to keep going to reception to get them fixed which was fairly annoying.  Newspapers were also added to our bill the next day even though we didn't ask for them (the fee was removed once we pointed this out).

Overall stay was fairly pleasant but next time we might look into other options.",3,2011,07,09
115,"Good location, 3/4 star hotel.  Not bad, not amazing.","We were only here for a night, but the location was perfect, the hotel was nice but not worth the money.  But it was peak season.  Lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance, they have a  gym, but no pool, so my husband used the nice ymca around the corner.  

Rooms were smaller, service was good, clean. Beds too soft.",3,2011,07,07
115,"Excellent location, compact but all you need","Rooms a bit small but this is central London in an older area. Very comfortable, bed was one of the best we've had, including France and Italy. Very quiet, air-con worked well. Bathroom small but had all we needed, shower was good.
Staff were very helpful, good staff numbers, knowledgable.
Very convenient to transport, many areas just a short walk away.
Breakfast was OK, but not exceptional, and expensive. We went out to nearby cafes after the first morning.
Overall, highly recommended.",4,2011,07,06
115,Nice hotel but missing wow factor,"Stayed here for 2 nights, arrived on Friday afternoon to check in at 3pm only to be told the room wasn't ready, was told we could leave luggage with concierge and as an apology have a couple of free cocktails in the bar. Arrived back at 5pm to attempt check in again, while checking in, the receptionist just gave out cocktail vouchers to the couple checking it, so guessing the ""apology vouchers"" were in fact just given to everyone at check in. Now it’s not like we were actively looking for something for the room not being ready, but this irked a bit in the fact they were passed off in this way.
Checked into the room (809) and it was basically a box for £200 a night. Yes, London is stupidly expensive, but with the room arranged as i was you couldn't see the TV and the room was so dark without the lights on you could barely see anything, although the view out the window was a nice brick wall!! Had a moan at reception (who wouldn't), and to their credit they moved us, although they had to come up and collect our stuff and let us use the existing room to get ready as by now it was getting late and we wanted to go out.

So that aside, the hotel location is excellent, right around the corner from the Dominion Theatre and just a short walk to the British museum.
The staff are all very friendly and polite.
The hotel bar was nice, but if we didn't have the voucher, the price for a cocktail was scary.
While the hotel is efficient it just seems to lack that wow factor of some other London hotels. It’s not that there is really anything majorly wrong with the place; it’s just lacking that certain something.
I would stay here again, but only if I got a good deal.",3,2011,07,04
115,Fantastic hotel,"I was very happy with my stay at the Bloomsbury. First of all, the location is excellent. A short walk from most West End theatres, not to mention Soho, Piccadilly Circus, and the British Museum to name a few highlights, I could not have asked for a better spot to call home base for my trip. It's relatively quite close to just about everything in central London.

The staff was very friendly and always ready to help in any way. They went out of their way to make me feel welcome. My room was spotlessly clean, and the cleaning staff kept it that way. There was also free wi-fi, which was a very pleasant surprise. 

The hotel is conveniently close to the Tottenham Court underground station, which will get you pretty much anyplace that's connected to the metro system. Getting around was quite easy. One minor note: the Northern line currently is not servicing this station while the city performs upgrades. Supposedly it will be back in full service by late 2011. It was only a minor inconvenience for me (an extra connection on one occasion, an extra five minute's walk on another), but if you're planning on going in the next few months you might want to be aware of this ahead of time.

As I've said, my experience was overwhelmingly positive, but in the interest of complete disclosure, I will mention two minor nitpicks. First, the view from my room was admittedly somewhat unimpressive, although it did kind of grow on me. My room faced the brick wall of the back of the Dominion theatre, and the alley between the two buildings. To be fair, I never asked for a picturesque view, nor really needed one, as I spent as much time out and about as I could.

Second, the place isn't cheap. That being said, we are talking about a hotel in the dead centre of one of the most expensive cities on the planet. Though it stretched my budget to the limit, I have to admit it was well worth it. 

All in all, I'm glad I went with this hotel. It made all the difference in the world.",5,2011,06,26
115,We loved our stay,My daughter and I stayed at The Bloomsbury Hotel this past week and loved our stayed. The accomodations were very comfortable. It is obvious a refurbishment has recently occurred. Our room was small but comfortable. The staff was very friendly especially the bellhops.The kitchen staff was nice enough to allow us to eat breakfast even when we arrived shortly after 10:30am. We highly recommend Afternoon Tea in the hotel lobby after a day of sightseeing. We would definitely come back to The Bloomsbury Hotel.,4,2011,06,23
115,Great location and service,I've stayed a several other hotels in London and hadn't found one I really liked until I stayed at The Bloomsbury Hotel. The hotel is in a great location in the theater district. There a lots of restaurants near by as well. The hotel staff is pleasant and was helpful with my multiple travel needs during my visit. The room was quiet and well appointed. The only thing that threw me for a loop was that there was no dresser. I was on a 20 day business trip so I had a lot of items with me. They happily provided me with more hangers but a small dresser would have been preferred. All and all a very good stay.,4,2011,06,23
115,Lovely Hotel in a fantastic location,"My wife and i had a lovely weekend stay at The Bloomsbury whilst in London. We were very lucky as we were upgraded to a suite which was spacious and very comfortable.

Positives:

- Very clean room, Large comfy King size bed, quiet, great location ( Near theatres, Covent Garden, Oxford street, British museum and Tottenham Court Road Tube). Large bathroom and shower, lovely breakfast (opt for the ""Leisurely London"" package, costs £40 for the 2 nights, includes full breakfast on both mornings, £15 drink voucher and a 3pm late checkout, a bargain seeing as the breakfasts are £22 alone! They even delivered to our room free of charge) The TV in the bathroom & the Nespresso machine were nice touches.

The only negative i would give was that the room was very stuffy, even with the air-con on the lowest setting, i don't know if this was because we were on the top floor or there was an issue with the air-con? Other than that i can't really fault the hotel. 

If you're looking for somewhere comfortable, affordable and with a great location then seriously consider The Bloomsbury. I would definitely stay there again and will be recommending it to others.",4,2011,06,23
115,Pricey hotel in a good location,"Stayed 2 nights in June and we've enjoyed this pricey hotel. Really good situation near Oxford St, British Museum, Covent Garden...
Had booked a Deluxe Double room and had room #314 which was good in size. But the bathroom was very small and the bed was not the best. Cozy furnitures.
In-room Nespresso machine was a plus as well as free Wifi. But no breakfast included in our price.
Hotel staff is ok. Front desk staff especially should improve the customer service. Tried to charge us £60 for extras upon check-in but we've refused the offer. Concierge staff was better. 
You can have a nice dinner at the Indian restaurant in front of the hotel.
Next time, we might choose another hotel for the same price or cheaper.",4,2011,06,18
115,"Great service, great staff","I really enjoyed my couple days at the Bloomsbury.  It's in a VERY good location.  VERY close to the metro.  I was greeted by Abby who was very nice. It means a lot when the front desk people are very personable.  The bar was awesome too.  I had a GREAT margarita down there.  
The only thing I didn't like about the rooms, was the carpet.  It wasn't nice looking carpet.  But the room size was great and the hotel was very clean.  Very Very Good",4,2011,06,15
115,Wonderful Hotel and Service,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights at the end of May and it was a wonderful experience. The concierge was very helpful and the location is great (right off Tottenham Court Road station).

The first room that was given to us was not made and we were given another room immediately along with complimentary drinks for the mistake. The room was on the second floor and much larger. It has all the modern amenities. 

The shower pane is interesting since it can swing in/out, allowing water to get all over the bathroom floor. This style of shower door seems to be in common in Europe and not a bid deal. At times the ceiling light over the vanity/sink would not work either. Not a major deal but can be a nuisance.

As it was the Champions League final at Wembley, the concierge and receptionist was very helpful in giving us places to potentially watch the game. Turn down service in the evenings was a plus.

Overall we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again.",4,2011,06,15
115,"Great hotel...not cheap, but worth it!!","Stayed at the Bloomsbury last week for a couple of nights for shopping and meeting family. I picked this based on Tripadvisor comments and I wasn't disappointed. From the friendly hello from Adnan on the door (who throughout my stay was friendly and chatty) to the check-in who, as it was a warm day, provided a bottle of water to keep cool whilst completing the paperwork. 
The room was very, very comfortable!...bathroom whilst quite small was beautifully equipped. The only slight criticism (and I'm being picky here!) is there was no bathmat in the bath which meant it was bit slippy when having a shower. The room was also a bit dark but not much of an issue and doesn't affect my rating here. 
Had a meal in the lovely bar and the food was very good, whilst the service from the bar staff was friendly and very efficient...thanks go to Gasper who was excellent (see you there again soon!)
Great location just around the corner from Tottenham Court Road tube station...literally a few minutes walk, and lots of places of interest very near by...British Museum, Oxford Street, Covent Garden etc.
If the price is right I would not bother looking anywhere else in London so I can't say more than that!!",5,2011,06,15
115,Excellent,"Loverly hotel in a great location. It was out 1st wedding anniversary and we wanted to stay somewhere nice. The turn down service was a nice touch along with the robes and slippers. We even received a complimentary bottle of wine delivered to the room, I wasnt sure if everyone gets this but this arrived with only one glass! We would definately stay here again.",4,2011,06,14
115,A wrong most definitely righted,"Our latest stay here was a complimentary night due to a bit of a fiasco this time last year where we were treated a little shoddily (that review is on here further down). I’ll say one thing for the Bloomsbury Hotel, if they’ve wronged you and you let them know about it, they certainly try their utmost to put it right. They didn’t need to put us in a suite, and they didn’t need to provide full cooked breakfast, but they did and it was much appreciated. The suite was superb: spacious and luxurious. The quality of the breakfast constituents was quite exceptional for a large hotel. The Bloomsbury is a lovely hotel and the staff are (aforementioned fiasco aside) brilliant. It is again my first choice for accommodation in Bloomsbury (but without a pools win, not a suite unfortunately).",5,2011,06,13
115,"great hotel, poor housekeeping",got a small room but got a larger one only when i requested. location is great. service and staff are friendly and helpful. there are no ramps in the outside for easy access but there is a lift on the side. housekeeping is poor. i stayed for 8 nights and the room was not vacuumed once! bed covers rarely changed.,4,2011,06,13
115,Small room with uncomfy bed,Lovely public areas and helpful staff but we had a very small room with a bed that was impossible for two people to sleep in. You roll into the middle instantly and spend all night gripping on to the edge like you're on a ship! Don't go in room 518!  They did lend us an umbrella though!,3,2011,06,13
115,We didn't want to leave!,"We have just got home from an amazing and relaxing stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel. The location of the hotel is just perfect, within walking distance from the British Museum, Oxford Street, Covent Garden, the west end theatres and so on. The Staff here were all so friendly, helpful, warm and approachable! Nothing was too much trouble, and all the staff made sure that we had the perfect stay. Our room was beautiful, and the largest that we have stayed in, and our bathroom was perfect, with a bathtub and a wet room style shower. It was cleaned regularly, and each we can back from being out it had been tidied and we had fresh towels each day, which was a perfect touch. The restaurant was brilliant, the food and service were above and beyond anything we have experienced before. We didn't want to leave! Thank you Bloomsbury Hotel for giving us the perfect city break!! We will be coming back in the near future.",5,2011,06,05
115,Outstanding hotel,"Outstanding hotel, stay he regularly for work.  Very central, walking distance to lots of nightlife, beautifully decorated, and just altogether much better now that Doyles have taken it over from Jury's.

If it was to provide any form of constructive criticism, I would much rather have a buffet breakfast than have to wait on my order being cooked.  That is so old fashioned.",5,2011,05,24
115,Luxury in the heart of Londonbut at a price !,What a fantastic hotel. The staff and the rooms really are first class. The bathrooms are particularly impressive with underfloor heating and the whole hotel is just great. It is however expensive and breakfast is certainly not worth the extra £21 !,5,2011,05,17
115,A home away from home,"I had a fantastic 6-night stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel last week. The room was spacious & quiet; well appointed with comfy bed, robe/slippers and nice amenities. Free wi-fi and a US-style electrical socket were huge bonuses. Very convenient location one block from the British Museum &  quieter end of Bloomsbury Street in one direction; in the other direction, just around the corner from the bustle of Tottenham Court Road and Oxford St, with a Sainsburys, Boots, and Caffe Nero within a block. Very close to the Tube as well. 

But the best part was absolutely the people who work there. Every person at reception was so friendly and helpful, the housekeeping staff were lovely and the concierges/doormen were fantastic. A special thanks to Adnan on the front door, who made me feel so welcome - he was really above and beyond.",4,2011,05,17
115,Perfect hotel for a perfect stay!!!,"We booked an 8 night stay based upon TripAdvisor reviews and boy are we glad we did!  We could not have asked for a better experience.  Alison, at the reception desk, could not have been friendlier- from check-in to check-out!!!

We will look no further than the Bloomsbury Hotel on our next visit to London!",5,2011,05,15
115,"Great hotel, a gem, brilliant stay","Had a great stay at this hotel. Brilliant location, very central 10 minutes walk to Covent Garden.
 Stayed in Deluxe room which we could not fault, big comfortable bed, nice bathroom, well equipped with nice toiletries. Coffee machine in room, gowns and slippers.   Booked a Leisurely London package, which was fantastic, included lovely breakfast (which you can have room service at no extra cost) and a 3pm late checkout, which is fantastic after a late night as you don't feel rushed to have breakfast and check out quickly  and a £15 food and beverage credit, which gets you a couple of drinks in the bar, to get you started.
Really nice helpful staff and I must say a a special thankyou to Gasper, the bar tender, who gives you a warm welcome and could give Tom Cruise a run for his money with his cocktails and booze knowledge!
Having stayed in hotels for business all over the UK, I think The Bloomsbury is a real gem and am just about to book to return.",5,2011,05,14
115,Wonderful Experience!... great place to stay.,"I booked the Bloomsbury hotel as a surprise for my boyfriends birthday, and i am so glad i did.... the hotel is beautiful, the room was perfect and the service is impeccable!!.. top class. we also had dinner at The bloomsbury street bar and restaurant which is located within the hotel which was also very good.
 The overall experience was Perfect!!!.... i would highly reccomend this hotel.",5,2011,05,14
115,Perfect stay for my birthday,"We stayed for one night in a superior room. The room was well decorated and had a huge, very comfy queen size bed. The only downside was the scaffolding outside our bedroom window, but that can't be helped.

The hotel itself is beautiful. We were given complimentary cocktails in the lovely bar as it was my birthday.

We had breakfast in bed which was very yummy and had a late check out of 3pm which was great.

The location is great, right by Oxford street and Covent garden.

I would stay here again - just don't get muddled up with this hotel and the other bloomsbury hotel on the corner, like our taxi driver did!!",4,2011,05,12
115,"Nice hotel, great location","This is a great hotel for a visit to London.  It's not the  least expensive, but the location is superb, and we felt at home there during our recent visit.  If your trip is short, it's worth the splurge in order to be in that location.",4,2011,05,05
115,Overrated with some issues,"Stayed here recently on business. Problems started on checkin as my room wasn't ready. I was offered a complimentary coffee as compensation for the delay - however it was over an hour before I managed to get to my room. The checkin experience left a really bad impression.

All in all, the hotel is average for the class. Food seemed expensive - breakfast especially.

I've stayed in other hotels in the chain and they were ok - perhaps this was a one off bad experience. I don't plan on using this hotel again as there are better options in the area.",3,2011,05,05
115,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed for two nights with my husband for a leisurely break.  When we got to our room we were supllied with complimenatry still and sparkling water and a very nice bottle of red wine.  We had only been in the room for five minutes and a waitress arrived with a complimentary bottle of champagne to welcome us to the hotel. We also loved the nespresso coffee machine that was in our room.  The beds are extremely comfortable and are very roomy.  

The staff are extremely polite and helpful.  They are there and tend to your every need.  the TV has enough channels to please everyones taste.  The only downfall I would say about the room is in the bathroom there is a speaker that is linked to the tv and you are unable to turn it down.  But that is being extremely picky...it is the ONLY downside to this hotel.

The location is wonderful.  It is close enough to all the main attractions of London but is set in a quiet street so you are not affected by the hustle and bustle of the night life.  

I did not want to leave this hotel, it was fantastic.  There are not many hotels I would want to stay in again but I will definately be returning to this one.",5,2011,04,23
115,Lovely peaceful hotel in good location,"Enjoyed an overnight stay here. Reception and concierge extremely welcoming and efficient.  Our room was lovely, furnished to a high standard and perfectly clean. Breakfast was ok, but at £21 not that inspiring.  We had a good night's sleep as our room was amazingly quiet for central London. The only complaint we had was that everywhere seemd a little too dark - subdued lighting is all very good but this felt dark,  getting ready in our room we were unsure how we looked until we got outside into the light. The breakfast room was the same, dark. Despite this overall a good stay and  somewhere we would return to.",4,2011,04,21
115,Fantastic hotel- great value for something much more luxurious,"Gorgeous hotel- outside looks quite big, then once inside a massive lounge/reception area, very plush. The room was a good size, lots of mirrors and nice decor. Bathroom was lovely and lots of little extras around the room. It was also very quiet.

The staff were very pleasant and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. We went out for the evening and when we came back found that they had laid out the dressing gowns for us, drawn curtains, tidied up etc. A lovely surprise as we were not expecting room service at that time. 

It's a good location for Covent Garden which is in walking distance, especially good if you are seeing a show, eating out or shopping. Really easy to get to from Tottenham Court road tube station, which is great if you have a lot of luggage.

I would definitely recommend this hotel. For what it is its really not that expensive, you would probably pay at least £100 a night for london even if its just premier inn. This hotel is not over priced and is definately worth a little extra for quality and luxury. We will certainly be returning.",5,2011,04,17
115,Great Stay,"Stayed at The Bloomsbury for a 1 night break in London.  Really nice looking hotel from the outside and well located (2-3 minute walk from Tottenham Court Road tube station).  Staff were very friendly, hotel was very clean and tidy.  As it was only a 1 night city break we didn't actually use the hotel much but it was a confortable night sleep.  Bed and pillows were a bit too soft, but this is personal taste rather than a critisism as they are good quality.  Bathrooms was really nice as were the soaps and shampoos etc.  My only little complaint was the room.  It was a good size but we had a superior room and the picture of a superior room on their website is obviously not the reality, either that or we were just unlucky on room allocation.  We booked via a hotel booking  website and I had requested a nice room (as it was out 1st wedding anniversary) on a high floor, we were given a fairly dark and fairly small room, in the middle of the hotel, looking onto a brick wall.  I would definitly stay here again and recommend to others.",4,2011,04,11
115,A very nice hotel centrally located in London,"Overall, we had a very pleasant stay at The Bloomsbury. The staff was very friendly, accommodating and helpful.  Explaining to them at check in that I had had a bad experience in a noisy room in a different hotel, the staff went out of its way to make sure I had a quiet room and gave my husband and I certificates for a free cocktail because the room they had found for us wasn't quite ready.

The room itself was very stylishly decorated, clean and had upscale amenities including a minibar, nice toiletries and robes/slippers.  At the desk in the room there were outlets accommodating a variety of international electrical plugs, including U.S. which was a nice ""perk"".   The room itself was a bit cramped (this was London afterall) but the bed was extremely comfortable and the room very quiet.  The only negative was the shower which, if one were not careful, could result in water all over the floor of a somewhat small and awkwardly set up bathroom.

The Bloomsbury is located right near the Tottenham Court underground which is quite central to a number of locations in London.  All in all, we had a very pleasant stay.",4,2011,04,08
115,"Mixed experience--overall, disappointing","I'd like to give 3.5 stars for this one but can't, so I'm rounding down to 3 rather than up to 4 because the hotel's current average on TA (4.5) is a little high, IMO. (I think people are grading on a curve because it's London, where practically everything is disappointing for the money!)

Those other glowing TA reviews played a large role in my choice of this hotel for a weekend in London to celebrate my mother's birthday (a big one). Overall it was fine, but it wasn't as special an experience as I'd hoped it would be. 

I booked a studio suite for Mom, me, and my infant daughter to share. I sent an email to the hotel shortly after booking asking them to separate the king bed into two twins, requesting an especially quiet room location, and letting them know how important it was to us (two asthmatics and a baby) to have a nonsmoking room far away from any smoking rooms. I also let them know it was my mother's birthday, and asked a few questions about the package I had booked.

Either my original email went astray or it was overlooked, because I received no response. I also sent a query through the Doyle Collection website form and received no reply to that. I re-sent my email from another account the week before our arrival and received a prompt response acknowledging my bed request and nonsmoking request. (But not answering my question about the package). Not a great impression right off the bat.

However, when we arrived at the hotel, Gabby checked us in right away with great courtesy and professionalism. She was able to check us in very early (10:30 or 11 am, I think), which we appreciated so much since it meant that my daughter could nap right away after our long journey. The bellman (Paulo?) was also very kind and helpful. 

That afternoon we received a very nice complimentary fruit plate in the room. No note, so not sure if this is a standard welcome amenity in the studio suites, or a kind of acknowledgment of Mom's birthday. Nobody ever mentioned the birthday during our stay, so I wonder.

Our bedroom was exactly as pictured under the studio suite category on the hotel's website. The beds were extremely soft and not supportive, but not uncomfortable. The armchairs with ottomans were very comfortable for lounging, and the large round table was great for spreading out (and for setting up room service). The closet was not very large, but perfectly fine for a short stay.

The bathroom was considerably smaller than pictured. It did have a separate tub, but not the rolltop affair in the photo, and there was about two feet of space between the tub and the toilet (and shower around the corner). As other reviewers have noted, lighting is inadequate for makeup application and hairstyling. 

I agree with other reviewers that the lighting controls in the room are very hard to figure out, and the climate control panel often doesn't seem to respond to one's inputs. Another disappointing feature of the renovation which I'm not sure others highlighted is the lack of adequate soundproofing between rooms and between the room and the hall. Particularly in the bathroom, we could hear the conversations of other guests nearby. Every noise in the hall was audible (housekeeping, maintenance, guests), and one night were were unlucky enough to be kept awake by a couple's lovemaking session somewhere. 

Housekeeping was really disappointing. When we arrived, the bedroom seemed very clean and the sink, toilet, and shower were also well cleaned, but the tub had a layer of dust and several hairs. I had to wash it out myself before bathing my daughter in it. Then, when our room was made up on Saturday (we stayed Friday to Sunday, so it was only made up Saturday), the housekeeper didn't replace used toiletries or Nespresso pods, and worst of all, left us with only half a roll of toilet paper! Further, although we had left the room very tidy, the few things we left out (a hairdryer plugged in at the desk; books on the bedside table; toiletries in the shower) weren't put away or straightened at all. Of course that's not the stuff of nightmares, but it did fall short of the standard I expect from a hotel of this category. The toilet paper issue, on the other hand, fell short of the standard I expect from a Holiday Inn!

We ordered room service three times (breakfast twice and dinner once) and were happy with the quality of the food, generous portions, and prompt and friendly service. Pricey, but that's to be expected. The food menu did seem a bit limited. Drinks menu was extensive.

The second night of our stay we had two major problems with the room environment. It was a funny situation because normally I would have called the front desk about each, but my baby was already asleep for the night and I didn't want to risk waking her by making the phone call (or having a maintenance person visit the room for the first issue). 

1) The heat stopped working completely just as the adults were getting ready to go to bed. We turned the thermostat up all the way, but nothing but cold air blew from the vents. We just put an extra blanket on the baby and huddled under the covers ourselves. The system seemed to have fixed itself in the morning. 

2) The same night, our nonsmoking room started to fill with cigarette smoke. If we turned off the climate control it mitigated the smoke issue somewhat, but we really needed the heat in mid-March. The choice between warm, smokey air and less smoke but no heat became a moot point when the heat quit working!

The chainsmoking neighbor and the aforementioned amorous couple kept the adults up most of Saturday night (fortunately, baby slept!) so our sleep quality was pretty poor. When the smoker started up again Sunday morning, I called the front desk and Michael must have sent someone to investigate right away as the smoke stopped very soon thereafter. I was quite grateful for that and only wished I had been able to call in the night! Still, it is disappointing that the just installed climate control system not only ceases to heat from time to time, but also connects the rooms so intimately that a nonsmoking room can become a fumoir in a matter of minutes.

When we departed, Gabby checked us out after only a short wait, again with a perfect friendly and professional manner. She provided us with bottles of water for the trip; a nice touch. 

I waited a couple of weeks to write this review because I just wasn't sure how to summarize our strange, mixed experience. Some parts of our stay (front desk, bedroom, room service, location) were very nice, but the rest was so disappointing that all I can muster for this hotel is a big shrug. I'll try someplace else next time we're in town.",3,2011,04,02
115,Exellent short break,"We have recently returned from a short stay at The Bloomsbury,we are four adults just  wanting a nice relaxing few days break and this hotel made our stay perfect.From the moment we arrived all the staff were friendly and helpfull.Our rooms were spotless,the beds were some of the best we have encounted,we were on the fourth floor and although we over looked the main street there was no noise at all.We have stayed at lots of hotels in London and woulld rate this as one of the best.We had a small booking  problem when we arrived and with the help of Larry Casillo it was soon sorted out .We will definately be returning to this hotel again whenever we are in London.",5,2011,03,27
115,Modern clean spacious room with fab breakfast,"Stayed in their deluxe room which was very pleasant. Loved the coffee machine and lovely big bathroom even if the shower flooded all over the floor (R212).Bed was average quality. Room service breakfast was the best we have had in London and we have stayed at the best hotels in Knightsbridge and Park Lane. 
Only thing putting me off is the area as tottenham court road area isn't too smart!",4,2011,03,22
115,GREAT location,"Even though we arrived a tad too early we got an early check-in and a slightly bigger room than we ordered. The staff was friendly and professional.

The rooms are lovely, very clean and well decorated. 

Locationwise, you are in the centre of it all. Walking distance to Covent Garden and all of the amazing shops, clubs and events in SOHO.

I would definitely stay here again.",4,2011,03,12
115,Good quality hotel in a central location with lovely rooms,"I stayed at this hotel for business.  I would guess it's been given a makeover recently, as the room was lovely, a good size and the furnishings and bathroom looked pretty new.
The public areas are very classy, well furnished and beautifully decorated.  Rooms are stylish with good facilities - the one I had even had a coffee machine.  Bathrooms modern and very clean with good quality toiletries.
Staff were very helpful and the check-in and -out were quick and efficient.
Restaurant and bar are in the basement, well decorated and modern.  Breakfast is good, plenty of choice both cooked and continental breakfasts and service was quick.
The only thing that seemed to be missing was guests!  I stayed on a Saturday night and the bar and restaurant were quiet, though there seemed to be more people about the next morning.
Would certainly recommend the hotel - it's in a good location, not far from British Museum, Oxford Street shops and Covent Garden.  And it's high on my list of favourite hotels in London, so I will definitely return.",4,2011,03,10
115,"Incredible staff, you are not a room number you are vip.","I spent 17 nights at this amazing hotel, it was my second stay there(within 6 months),and the service was excellent as usual.Special thanks to Zain,,Adnan,Brian,Gary, Paulo,Gary,Nalef, the front desk people (all),the General Manager and the duty manager,Mr.Chris Bowen and his staff notably Tanveer and Aashiq,the Polish guy in the lobby bar, the room service people, the housekeeper and Mr Jamaly.",5,2011,03,08
115,Good location...,"Top quality hotel.  Staff very helpful and knowleable.
Beds beautifully comfortable. Room very quiet until everyone started showering in the morning - but that is only a small annoyance.
Good location for museums, shopping, eating - secure NCP car park only a few yards away.
I would definitely stay here again, and also recommend to friends.",4,2011,02,27
115,Excelent Value/Cost !,"Excelent hotel. Very nice and relatively spacious rooms, well maintained and furnished. Relative to othher big city hotels the rooms are not crouded and you don't suffer a claustrophoby feeling. Continental breakfast (part of our deal) was excelent and rich. 
Hotel staff very friendly and helpfull. Great Location- close to Covent Garden , theter land , Trafalgar but in a very quiet place.  Plenty excelent restorants in the neigborhood.",5,2011,02,25
115,Best Hotel We've EVER Stayed In...And We Travel A Lot!,"The Bloomsbury is EASILY the best hotel that my husband and I have ever stayed in!  The staff was so polite and accomodating, and provided exeptional service throughout our entire stay.  The location is great (a two minute walk away from the British Museum), and the whole hotel was beautifully decorated and very modern.  Our room was huge, even by American standards, and had a very comfortable pillow top bed with a fluffy comforter and pillows, a fully stocked desk and writing area, and two separate seating areas.  The bathroom had a jacuzzi tub, a lighted sink, and a separate shower area with a large rain shower head and several separate wall shower spouts.  Extra comforts included plush robes and slippers, plenty of extra towels, ample personal hygene and travel products, an in room espresso machine and fully stocked tea station, an in room safe, a television in the jacuzzi tub, complementary sparkling and still water and snacks, and maps and directories for London placed neatly on the desk in our room, just to name a few.  The staff also held our luggage for us, free of charge, after we checked out so that we could spend some final hours exploring the city.  I would rate this hotel with five stars based on the decor, service, location, and extra comforts, and am truly surprised that it is only rated with four stars.  We found this hotel fairly expensive, but better priced than other comparable hotels in London.",5,2011,02,15
115,A long weekend away to take in some shows.,"Although it is expensive we knew this before we booked so no real surprises there.
Our room was not ready for us when we arrived - not the best of starts - and not what you would expect for an establishment such as this.
The concierge service in respect to finding us bookings or getting access to places was useless.
Thats us done with the negetaives - everything else was positive - the room was excellent the ensuite bathroom was immaculate, the towels and bathrobes clean and fluffy, the room was decorated in the best taste, was well maintained and was very spacious and quiet.
The hotel restaurant and bar were very good and the staff only too pleased to assist - they understood my wifes Ceoliac allergy and recommended and adjusted things in the kitchen to suit - they even had gluten free bread- made her feel very comfortable - great! This ensured they received big personal tip from me!",5,2011,02,10
115,A Solid Four Star Hotel,"I found the Bloomsbury Hotel to be a solid 4 stars. The room size was pleasant for London, the bed comfortable, and the little extras appreciated - a good selection of magazines were in the room, the aromatic toiletries were nice, and the Nespresso Krups machine a convenient touch. The staff we encountered were polite and efficient, and the hotel was clean and elegantly decorated. The shower is an in-bath affair, which are never terribly comfortable to use, but it did the job. 

Breakfast in the morning was enjoyable - the buffet selection had an array of museli toppings, some cooked meats, fruit, and the usual fare. From the hot breakfast, I had the waffle with syrup, which was thick and chewy and simply lovely - a good start to the day. 

On the same street at the British Museum, this is a good hotel for the tourist, with Tottenham Court Road being the nearest tube station. Although I usually stay in other London locations, the Bloomsbury Hotel was comfortable and may draw me back to the Bloomsbury area in the future.",4,2011,01,20
115,"Great Hotel, Rude Staff!!!!!","I stayed at The Bloomsbury for one night last weekend. The room was lovely and very clean but the sheets were very noisy and rustled everytime I moved and woke me up countless times throughout the night. Also the rooms are very dark as is the whole hotel.
I only ate breakfast here but it was delicious and cooked very well.
The worst thing about this hotel is the staff, they really let it down! One of the bar guys in particular was unbelievably rude to me, my mother and my sister-in-law. He was so rude, he has put us off ever staying here again! He treated us as if we were insignificant and made us feel very uncomfortable! And he also took about 10-15 minutes to make 3 drinks!
Just goes to show, you can pay £200 per room and still get really bad service! Think I'll stay at Premier Inn next time, at least I know I'm guaranteed a good nights sleep and the staff will treat me with respect!",3,2011,01,19
115,Stayed there twice already,"I already stayed twice at this hotel. The location is great, it is close to Oxford Street and only 300m walking form Russell Square tube station. Also the Britische Museum is close by. 
For London this Hotel has a very high room standard. Althought there seem to be differnt room types. The first time, the room style seemed to be more modern, while during my second stay it had a more classic style. Both times everything was perfect.
As I had no breakfast there, I can't say anything about that.",5,2011,01,16
115,Good choice for London,"We liked this hotel very much.  We had a studio suite, which was spacious, comfortable, and modern.  We especially appreciated the huge bathroom.  We also appreciated having free wifi in our room.  The hotel's location is excellent -- close to everything in the west end, but on a quiet street so that we weren't bothered by noise from outside.  The breakfast choices they offered were quite expensive, so we went out to cafes instead -- too bad they didn't offer less-expensive choices.  My only complaint about our room is that it was quite dark.  The lighting was modern, with focused spotlights that were good for illuminating specific areas, but left a lot of dark shadows.  Overall, though, our stay was very satisfactory and I think it would be difficult for us to find a better hotel in central London for a comparable cost.",4,2010,12,28
115,Just great!,"Great hotel, great location, great staff!
A really nice hotel located very close to the British Museum and shopping area at Oxford/Regent Streets.
Neat and well designed premises, friendly, genuinely caring and efficient staff, quite spacey rooms and bathrooms, tasty breakfast and great cocktails at the bar.
One minus point: lift(s) - when going down for breakfast - the two existing relatively small lifts did not have enough capacity to get us down for some 10 mins (the hotel was full and therefore the lifts capacity did not match the number of guests on a weekend). Also, there is no lift/ramp for wheelchairs/pushchairs at the entry so our pushchair was each time carried by the door boy. Shame.

All in all - a very pleasant place to stay in very central location in London.",4,2010,12,11
115,Breakfast can be improved,"Great Service,wonderful helpful staff.Clean and well designed rooms.
Very expensive breakfast menu..
The Breakfast  buffet needs improvement,the choices were limited and cooked breakfast portions  were very small,not value for money.
Sleep in the hotel and have your breakfast somewhere else.",4,2010,12,11
115,Not the services of a four star hotel,"We've  stayed at this hotel 2 years ago and we liked it. This time it was a nightmare.
The first evening it was very cold in the room - colder than on the corridor. First they said we have to wait a while to get hotter but we waited more then one hour and nothing. 
The heating was not working properly- 5 minutes it was hot air , then 15 minutes it was cold air.
We asked another room but they only had one very small and also very cold. 
They brought us a heater but only the second day.
It took them four hours to agree that it was a problem with the heating so we barely sleep that night.
In the morning we did a big scandal and the manager agreed he wouldn't charge us the first night. When we checked out he was not there and the reception guy tried to make us pay also the first night. When he saw we are decided not to pay and we asked for the manager he gave us another bill which was already printed with the wright amount. 
Even so they charged the first night on our credit card even it was not on the bill.

Another issue is that the cleaning lady came to knock on our door 10 minutes after she saw us returning pretending to give us some biscuits which she was supposed to put in the room in the morning when she cleaned it. Not to mention we did not received any slippers but we saw a big box with it in the service room.",3,2010,12,09
115,loved it!,"Loved this hotel - we had a lovely room and so did my daughter and her partner. Every member of staff was so friendly and helpful, any staff you happened to meet in the corridors always greeted you and nothing was too much trouble. We had a slight problem with our reservation over a charge for breakfast - but this was sorted very quickly and the staff were full of apologies for the mistake. Have stayed in London many times at various hotels but none of them can match this one for the standard of the rooms, service or location. It was expensive but worth it.",5,2010,12,05
115,Dark Rooms,"Lovely hotel, but the rooms are designed for a man, they are too dark for putting your make up on, no mirror in front of the dressing table so nowhere to sit and dry your hair.  Even the bathroom was too dark and the tap set up made running a bath extremely slow.  If you go and stay there make sure you take your own small vanity mirror!!! Hairdryer was brilliant though.",4,2010,12,02
115,"Quality Hotel in British Museum Area, London - Great Concierge Staff, in particular","Frequent London Traveler, but this is at the top of the list of the hotels I've stayed in over many years, when combining location, convenience to the Tube, Quality shops, restaurants, museums and pubs in the vicinity, and within walking distance to Covent Garden, West End Theaters, Leicestershire Square, and easy Tube to Hyde Park, Kensingington, and the Tower.  Hotel itself is renewed in past ten years, but in a listed building; rooms and baths are small, but extremely well designed and maintained and the Staff is very professional and attentive. In particular both the head concierge, Brian Murphy, and the restaurant staff and chef were tremendously helpful.  Can't recommend enough.  Price was also a factor, and well worth the cost, including free WiFi (although lower floors have better service).",5,2010,11,27
115,Fabulous Hotel for a London City Break,"We have just returned from a three night stay at this superb hotel and cannot recommend it highly enough.Everything was special: the furnishings,decor,food,staff and ambiance.If I were to be picky I found the noise from the mini-bar irritating  as i tried to sleep but ear plugs sorted this out.
This is a great hotel in a tremendous location.",5,2010,11,26
115,Lovely Hotel,"This hotel is wonderful.  Nice surroundings, clean tasteful rooms and pleasant attentive staff. Its close to Oxfrod Street one way and to Covent Garden and the Theatres too.
The only tiny complaints 1) The rooms are too hot 2) Awful bath/shower tap arrangement made having a bath a pain.",5,2010,11,26
115,"poor, inattentive service, hardly ""luxury""","my negative experience was service related. I had multiple pieces of luggage and was not met by a bellhop to help get luggage up steps. after waiting in the rain i decided to do that myself, after which the bellhop not only did not apologize but suggested i should have left my luggage in the street and come up to ASK for help. If i had to ASK for help, then this is not luxury is it? I've had better experience at Hostels in my youth. This was the first impression of this hotel's service. The rest of the time we spent there only reinforced lackadaisical service as well as being locked out after midnight, which no-one warned me would happen. while location is superb, i will likely opt out for a different hotel next time.",2,2010,11,22
115,Stunning hotel and excellent service!!,"I booked this hotel was part of a theatre package and I have to say its one of the best hotels I have stayed in in London! Its foyer is stunning, service excellent and the room was luxurious.  Its location is brilliant being walkable distance to oxford street, piccadilly circus, leicester square etc.  We also had a continental breakfast included which was more than enough.

Overall would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2010,11,14
115,Very nice hotel,"Took a while to review which hotel to go to but could not fault the hotel, staff were very smart, polite and quick. Hotel was very clean and room was excellant, is situated just off Tottenham court road and is 2 minute walk to Oxford street, very quiet at night time.
Only had breakfast in hotel but this was of a very good standard.
All in all, could not fault the hotel and will certainly stay in one of the Ian Doyle collection again.",5,2010,11,10
115,"Gorgeous, modern hotel in the centre of everything","We loved our stay at the Bloomsbury hotel. Our room, a standard one, was lovely and modern, with spaciousness and a great bed. The internet (free) was speedy, and bathroom clean and new. 
The hotel is just simply luxurious. They burn fragrant candles in the foyer, so whenever you enter it smells divine. The exterior of the building is a well maintained period architecture piece, and in minutes you are at :Leicester Square, but far enough away for it not to be noisy 24/7. So close to the tube (Tottenham St Station) and it is a station that has a lot of links to other lines.
The staff are lovely and friendly, always greeted us warmly and were never brusque or rude.
It is ridiculous that this is a 4 star hotel, when our stay at both the Waldorf Hilton and Radisson Edwardian Hampshire, both 5 stars in the same area, were underwhelming in comparison.
If you get a good rate, stay here! You wont regret it.",5,2010,10,31
115,"Great Hotel, Great Location","I have stayed at this hotel 4 times for business, staying multiple nights each time. location is great near the west end and a block from a tube station. (take the Hethrow express to padington and then either cab or catch the tube with one transfer). Rooms are moderate to small but good enough size. LCD TV, marble bathrooms, good towels. Beds are comfortable with good linens. Beds are a bit soft for my taste, though. I have only eaten at the restaurant for breakfast but that is included and a very nice breakfast with buffet plus you can order hot food off the menu no extra charge. This is my go to hotel every time in london on business.",4,2010,10,12
115,"Still awaiting response from Hotel Manager , very poor !","My husband and i stayed in this hotel for the first time mostly because of the reveiws on tripadvisor ,and for location . 
We booked our room on the hotel site , and had a small reduction . We still paid £205 for the night , but felt it wpz worth it !!! , but how wrong were we . 
We were pointed to our room , which just in case you ever stay woz 512. take ear defenders with you , as you will be kept awake all night , by the water pump if you don, t .
We did ring down to reception twice and complain but were told , the noise would stop and also they could,nt move us as the hotel woz full , we only saw 3 people the whole time we were there . Customer service is not in use in this hotel !! 
We were contacted by e mail by the hotel manager to ask about our experience over 3 weeks ago , we have not heard another word .
My advice would be unless you are a business person and a regular guest  , avoid this hotel at all cost . Don,t stay !!",3,2010,10,11
115,"thoughtful staff, excellent facilities, great for Disabled","I was impressed that I had a phone call after booking online, from a member of staff to confirm that a wheelchair-friendly room had been allocated as requested, with further information about wheelchair access at the side of the hotel.  On arrival all went extremely smoothly.  Room was great, complete with a wet room en-suite rather than a bath, higher loo, a shower seat and lower sink - all ideal for the wheelchair user. Only grouse was that the lighting was poor in the room and bathroom.  Restaurant was very good, both in service and food.  Will definitely choose to stay there again.",5,2010,10,10
115,Great location fot the best price,"Stayed 2 nights in September with  my wife and we had a pleasant stay at the Bloomsbury hotel. 
Had booked in advance and had a very good price for a standard ""superior"" room as the call it. It came to 325 GBP with taxes but no breakfast (you'll find good places around for your morning start).
We've choosed this hotel for the price and of course its location which is really good. Next to Oxford St for shopping, easy access by bus or Tube at Tottenham Court Rd station, next to bars, cafés and restaurants.

We had room 410 and it was rather small but ok. Don't expect a US standard size there. Bathroom was modern with marble, room was nicely decorated with Flat screen TV, tea/coffee facilities, minibar, desk, A/C. The downside of the room is the bed (very soft so you can feel your partner moving during the night like jumping), and noisy on a Satruday night (people shouting in the Street).
But this is Central London and it's hard to beat this one. Staff is helpful and nice. 
Go for it! We'll surely come back with a good rate.",4,2010,09,23
115,Would definatly stay again,"Myself and Husband stayed one night at this hotel , location is excellent 2 min walk to Tottenham court Road.
We stayed in a standard room and it had everything we needed , nice comfy bed , widescreen TV,Iron and Ironing Board,Tea and coffee facilities etc. Staff were very nice and helpfull.
We had booked tickets to watch we will rock you and the theatre was located just at the end of the street which was perfect.
Yes its not the cheapest of hotels but as far as London hotels go this is is really nice.",5,2010,09,19
115,Great Hotel & Location,Stayed at Bloomsbury Hotel for three nights last week. Would definitely return on future trips to London. Walking distance to tons of stuff and easy tube access to everything else. Top notch.,4,2010,09,08
115,Top class,"Great location. Short way to Subway (Tottenham court road), ant Oxford street. 10-15 min walk to Covent garden and Leicester square. Just around the corner of British museum. 
Stylish, great service, good breakfast, trendy room with wonderful beds and pillows. A few stairs up to the entrance so disabled people has to enter through another entrance I think...? But all in all a top class experience!",5,2010,09,06
115,Very good 4 star and improving,"I travel to London on business most weeks and have now made the Bloomsbury my hotel of choice.   The beds are the most comfortable I've slept in in London.  The rooms vary in size, but all look very chic with modern decor and stylish bathrooms.  The staff are attentive and helpful.  The food is of a higher standard than other London 4 stars I've stayed in, and the pre theatre dinner menu excellent value (if I can get back in time for it - last orders by 7pm.  )  As other reviewer have said, it's an excellent location on a quiet road, but with Tottenham Court Rd tube station 2 minutes away and if you're there for pleasure, the West End and British Museum in walking distance. 

I have noticed a definite all round improvement over  the last year or so. After the refurb, I had a number of number of problems with the plumbing, heating and aircon - maybe I was just unlucky and my recent stays have been problem free. The service from staff has also improved and is now top notch.

A couple of suggestions:
 - PLEASE change the bar food menu from time for time for the benefit of your regulars!  All good stuff, but I can recite the menu by now!
-Leave some simple instructions in the rooms for the aircon /heating control - it just isn't intuitive and I still don't know how to work it. 
-Institute some form of loyalty reward for repeat guests - eg a free drink or maybe a voucher towards future stays.",5,2010,09,04
115,Top Choice Hotel,"Have just come back from 2 great nights at The Bloomsbury Hotel, celebrating our 1st wedding anniversary.  The staff we great, very professional but still managed to be friendly and helpful with a smile.  Checking in was easy and any relevant information was given about services and facilities, again with a nice friendly smile.  My 1st impression of the hotel from the reception area and staff was that we had made a good choice in this hotel and would enjoy out stay.  Upon entering our room, I was please to see that it was as good if not better than the photo's on the web site (which is most unusual). Room was nice and clean, good decor and a very comfy bed with the bathroom of a very nice standard.  Only food we had at the hotel was breakfast, which was nice but the Full English could have had a bit more to it for the price.  This is a great location for visiting attractions in London and has plenty of facilities around the area.",5,2010,08,29
115,Excellent Hotel!,"We stayed at The Bloomsbury Hotel for 8 nights and had a fabulous time!  The location was perfect for us as first time visitors to London.  The subway(tube) was right around the corner, as well as the West End where all the live theater shows and shopping are.  It is steps away from the British Museum and several cafes and restaurants, a few minutes walk to Covent Garden and Leicester Square.  The staff could not have been friendlier from the moment we walked thru the door.  Everyone made us feel at home.  It's a warm and comfortable hotel that we highly recommend.   We look forward to our next visit, hopefully very soon!",5,2010,08,23
115,Love the location of this hotel,"Stayed 2 nights in a huge suite (room no 614), beautiful and clean.  Nothing too much trouble for staff all very friendly. Have stayed before when it was Jury's and the rooms are far superior now and the whole place is much fresher. Lovely continental breakfast with lots of choice. Great location, just around the corner from Dominion Theatre on Tottenham Court Road, we walked to Regent Street, Leicester Square, Covent Garden - no need for taxis (apart from Kings Cross to hotel £8).  Will use this hotel time and time again.",5,2010,08,23
115,FANTASTIC,"I chose this hotel after reading the reviews on trip advisor and im so glad i did. The location is ideal, both close to all the action and in a quiet street. I booked a superior but was lucky enough to be upgraded to a deluxe room upon arrival. The room was very spacious and the bed was so comfortable. The staff were all friendly, professional and make you feel its all about you. I booked directly through the hotels own website thedoylecollection ,and i got the best deal with the leisurely london package.",5,2010,08,22
115,Perfect Location in the West End,"This hotel is literally yards away from the bustling West End, Oxford Street, Theatreland etc. Despite its proximity to everything, it is located in a really quiet side street which helps for a peaceful night's sleep

The rooms were enormous and superbly decorated.

Breakfast was vast and delicious

This felt like a five star hotel, but is always available at very generous rates. Superb value for money",5,2010,08,18
115,Disappointed,"Stayed there last weekend for two nights.Rooms very small, had a problem with room and we were advised that they would move us to a bigger room.They did move us but to a same sized room
The manager was very helpful
The hotel itself is nice though",3,2010,08,16
115,Great Hotel,"Very stylish, spacious well thought-out rooms. Fantastic marble bathrooms -ours had bath and walk-in shower. The whole hotel was completely refurbished a year ago so everthing is prestine and new. All the period features of the building were kept so you have the best of both worlds, a lot of character and new stylish interiors.
The location is obviously great; minutes to Oxford Street, the British Museum etc.
Staff are very professional and polite.

We will stay again!",5,2010,08,16
115,"Nice Hotel, horrible beds","Spent three nights here with my daughter at the end of an 11 day graduation trip.
First of all, we thought the hotel's location was perfect - around the corner from theaters, a few blocks from the British Museum, plenty of restaurants nearby, and one block from Tottenham Court Road tube station.  The central location was especially important on the weekend we were there, because most of the tube system was closed that weekend.

The hotel lobby is nice, and they have a fast computer with printer for printing boarding passes.  The room was, I would say, average-sized for a London hotel of this class.  The bathroom was very modern and nicely equipped.  There was a great selection of teas in the room, including several herbals, which I appreciated.  We were on the 4th floor, and didn't have any trouble with noise.

We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel; but they had a pre-theater menu for 18 pounds which we took advantage of.  The restaurant was nice and the food was very good.  For breakfast there are a couple of restaurants right around the corner that serve reasonably priced breakfasts (just don't bother trying the pancakes - even though I've been to London a few times, I guess I didn't realize these are more of an American thing - not so great in London)

There was only one negative - and it was a big one.  The bed was terrible.  It was a double, not a full queen, and really in need of replacement.  It was so soft and broken-down that when my daughter and I were both in the bed, we would roll towards the center and end up on top of each other.  After the first night, I just slept at the other end of the bed, which made it bearable, but still not comfortable.

We got a good deal on the hotel through lastminute.com, so I didn't complain about the bed, but in general, I think a hotel of this quality should have usable mattresses.  Hopefully they will be replacing them soon, because other than the bed, it was a great hotel!",4,2010,08,15
115,Brillant - AGAIN!,"We stayed at this hotel in April this year and decided to stay again for our trip last week (10th-12th Aug - 2nights)  again, it was brilliant and it has now become our hotel of choice for London.
The location could not be better... in the quiet Great Russell Street but just 2mins walk to Tottenham Court Road Tube Station, and 10 mins to Holborn, Covent Garden and China Town. Turn right out of the hotel into the leafy park squares and beautiful houses of Bloomsbury or left into the hustle and bustle of Tottenham Court Road and the shopping areas  as well as SoHo etc.
Rooms, as last time, were lovely. Beautifully furnished with comfortable beds and hot, powerful showers. This time we had a wetroom type bathroom which was great! Rooms have everything you need, from a Tresemme Hairdryer to an iron and ironing board.
Breakfast was delicious. We only paid for continental but this was a great way to start your day, with lots of choice on the buffet - all fresh and delicious.
We really looked forward to visiting the hotel's restaurant again and we were not disappointed. The food is fantasic in taste and presentation. The pre-theatre menu (available 5pm to 7pm I think) is excellent value for money and no comprimise on taste or choice and you get a glass of wine included.
The foyer area of the hotel is great, with a computer for the use of guests. The little bar area in the foyer is lovely too.
The staff in this hotel are brilliant - they are so helpful and genuinely friendly.
I love this hotel and would always try to stay here when visiting the capital.",5,2010,08,14
115,Fantastic hotel with a great location,The Bloomsbury hotel is such a beautiful gem of a hotel right in the centre of the west end. The rooms are stunning and decorated to a very high standard. The staff were very helpful throughout of stay. And we would defiantly go back for a break in London.,5,2010,08,06
115,"Cosy, elegant top tier hotel for business travel","The Bloomsbury is a cosy, nice and elegant, very stylish hotel perfectly accomodating business travellers. The rooms are nicely furnished, coffee making facility. Excellent value for money. Great hairdryers. Comfortable beds. Nice breakfast. Nice lobby. A must in London. Close to several bars and restaurants. Quiet but located in a lively area.",5,2010,08,05
115,Another Superb Visit,"Just back from another great stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel. I have to say that each time I visit it seems better than the last. I have now made the Bloomsbury my hotel of choice when visiting London. The location is second to none, friendly staff and a light relaxed atmosphere make this hotel a real find and one which I have happily shared with business contacts and friends alike. I normally don't take breakfast when I travel, preferring to taste the local offerings when out & about. Having had only good experiences at the hotel so far I decided to include breakfast this time round. I was really pleased I did. The morning team are friendly and very helpful to just awake guests. The food was delicious and I was obliged with my specific requests when it came to the cooked breakfast. We had a leisurely 45 minutes and felt comfortable and taken care of at all times. (not the looks one gets at some hotels suggesting you eat and go). All in all I would give the Bloomsbury 10 out of 10 and will be happily returning later this year. My thanks to the front desk and breakfast team for making our visit so enjoyable.",5,2010,07,28
115,Luxurious Hotel - Great breakfast spread,"My mum and i stayed at the bloomsbury as part of a theatre break package.  It wasn't cheap by any means, but it was a bit of a treat weekend, so instead of our usual premier inn we stayed here!

When booking online we had to book a double, so we rang up before our stay and requested a twin, which they said they could do but it would cost us £45, so we thought we'd be ok to share for a night.  When we arrived at the hotel on the day, i asked again about having a twin, and they very kindly separated our bed (which was two singles zipped together) within 20 minutes with no charge or problem - ideal!

The room was very comfortable and had all of the usual facillities. The staff were gracious and polite and extremely helpful.

We had drinks in the bar later, which had a lovely relaxed atmosphere.  Thi highlight however for me was the amazing breakfast spread in the morning of breads, fruits, yoghurts, juices etc - it was all delicious!

The location is great - 20 minutes walk from eustom and waterloo, right by oxford street and not far from the west end - it was perfect!

Its certainly not a bargain hotel, but is no more expensive than most london hotels of this standard, and it had a luxurious feel and friendly service that can often be missing in some hotels in london.
I would most definitely stay here again.",4,2010,07,27
115,Fabulous experience all round,"Our visit was a perfect experience, from the moment we stepped into the hotel, the staff were welcoming polite and very attentive. Our room was pure luxury, only the call of exciting surroundings could tempt us out. Covent Garden, British Museum and wonderful little side streets to explore.
The breakfast staff in the restaurant could not have been more efficient and friendly.",5,2010,07,24
115,"Fantastic hotel - elegant, luxurious and peaceful. A must for a romantic weekend.","We stayed two nights at the Bloomsbury hotel. From the moment we arrived from a busy and hot London street, the hotel was cool, calm and elegantly furnished. Our room was modern, without the usual signs of wear and tear that seem to be so evident in English hotels. The bathroom in particular was excellent. The room was very quiet - no road noise, and the bed very comfortable - both making for a very peaceful stay.

The highlight of the hotel would have to be the breakfast. The breakfast can be ordered to your room with no extra charge. The continental selection was extensive - the muesli was fantastic! The full breakfast menu was also very well presented, if a little expensive!

The location of the hotel - just off Tottenham court road, 2 minutes from Oxford Street was brilliant. Such a central location meant that the haven of the hotel was never far away.

The only thing that I could possibly complain about was that we ordered a breakfast newspaper which didn't arrive. But as we were too busy shopping and checking out the sights of London this really was the tiniest of things in an otherwise perfect weekend.",5,2010,07,23
115,"Elegant, full-service hotel, close by to tube, Soho, the theater district and museums","I've become a frequent guest of the hotel, most often for business, and most recently on vacation with my wife.  Architecturally resembling more a city mansion than your typical glass and brass chains, The Bloomsbury blends the best of full-service hospitality with the elegance/intimacy of a boutique hotel.  The rooms are spacious and well appointed, the common area lobby is inviting and tranquil, and the hotel's location provides one with easy access to public transportation, and is within walking distance of The British Museum, Soho, Chinatown and Covent Garden.  The staff are friendly yet discreet, room service at 2AM brought me a terrific club sandwich, and the outdoor terrace, in summer, offers a quiet, leafy escape to unwind and  sip a Pimm's.  For the quality of the experience, the rates represent a great value.",5,2010,07,21
115,excellent and very beautiful hotel,i stayed at the bloomsbury for a few days and i have to say it was a very pleasent stay the room was gorgeous and very clean the food also lived up to my expectations it was excellent all staff were very attentive and friendly as well the location is excellent as its around the corner from all the best shops fantastic hotel all round would definitly stay again and would highly recommend,5,2010,07,19
115,If this is the 82nd best hotel on London (out of 1059) then we are in trouble.,"The taxi driver had difficulty in finding which 'Bloomsbury Hotel' so make sure you say Great Russell Street or mention it was formerly Jurys. Apparently, there are several hotels with the name Bloomsbury in them.

The main entrance has no disabled access and the foyer is a bit dismal. We had a superior room but it was quite small. On the day we were there, we were looking forward to dinner but the restaurant was closed. I mentioned this to reception and they said no-one had told them. Seems there was a private party on that night.

The staff were very good; amongst the most friendly and helpful we have ever come across. Overall, fair value for money but, staff apart, a bit underwhelming.",3,2010,07,14
115,"Lovely hotel, but get it at a good price !","We booked this hotel from Hotel.com because although on many sites, this was by far the best rate. It beat Lastminute.com by £40, so shop around if you like the look of it. 
The room was as shown on the website,""Superior"" and was very nicely presented. The Landseer restaurant had lovely food, although we were the only customers in there on a saturday evening. A mix up occured when we'd ordered from the ""wrong"" menu, but a complimentary Martini cocktail was soon offered and all was well. 
The location is great for shopping, the British museum and is in walking distance of the West end and Trafalgar square.
It is a lovely hotel but get it at  a good price, if you dont prebook breakfast @ £15, then you have to pay £21 on the day so dont get caught out here.",4,2010,07,06
115,A Memorable Stay,"We recently had a three night stay in the Bloomsbury hotel. It ticked all the boxes as the location was excellent (close to Tottenham Road Tube), the staff were friendly and the rooms were both clean and modern. The continental breakfast was more than adequate and the table service was top notch. We were also walking distance from Covent Garden and the West End shows. Hope this review helps. You wont be disappointed.",5,2010,06,30
115,"A truly comfortable, welcoming, quiet hotel with a wonderfully helpful and personable staff","We have been satisfied with hotels in London in the past, but on this, our first stay at the Bloomsbury hotel, we are convinced this will be our hotel of choice for subsequent stays.  Any request was promptly and courteously attended to.  The location is great ...right around the corner from Tottenham Court metro with access to the Central and Northern lines.  Would especially call out the Operations Manager, Mr. Larry Casillo, who went out of his way to meet and assist his guests. 
The hotel was quiet...we were never awakened by sirens as in other hotels. Also, convenient to dining facilities.  The hotel restaurant is also noteworthy.  
Would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to London",5,2010,06,22
115,Missed It By That Much,"The Bloomsbury is a nice-looking hotel.  The location is hard to argue with -- just around the corner from the Tottenham Court Road tube station.  The hotel is very, very quiet.  

All that being said, for a hotel that promotes itself as business-savvy and conference-ready, the Bloomsbury misses the mark by just that much.  

The room itself was small, though that's not unexpected for London.  But the lack of wireless internet means one is stuck at a rather uncomfortable desk.  The forced-air unit is loud and is either on or off -- on, it's on at one temperature only and off means hot-and-stuffy.  The sink was slow-draining, but a little bit of late-night plumbing by the guests took care of that.  Unfortunately, neither the tub nor the shower managed to quite produce ""hot"" water, or even a reasonable facsimile thereof, despite visits by the day manager and the hotel maintenance staff -- though all of them banged on things in the bathroom quite enthusiastically.

The front door staff are hit-or-miss; the ""doorman"" did a brisk business watching me open the door for myself, while the front desk staff almost always answered the phone in fewer than 20 or so rings.  The housekeeping staff are attentive and friendly -- nearly all emigre Poles -- if somewhat lackadaisical, but the fun of a $275 per night hotel is in tidying up yourself.  The restaurant staff are unmotivated and disorganized.  On a Monday night, with only 2 other people in the Landseer restaurant, it took 25 minutes alone just to get the entree -- and I was glad to have ordered the lamb rare, as it's difficult to imagine how long medium or well-done might have taken.  To the restaurant's credit, though, the food is very good, and I would advise the Full English Breakfast option for those who have places to get to in the morning.

Taken as a whole, the convenience of the location, the quality of the food, and the hotel's quiet on an otherwise noisy street give this hotel the 3rd star in this review.  Had I been paying myself, and not having it paid for, I would be deeply, deeply grieved by the inattentive service, lack of wireless and hot water, and overall phone-it-in attitude that seems to prevail here.",3,2010,06,03
115,"great location, great bed, value for money in London","If you book, suggest you ask for a room at the front of the hotel. Rooms at the back are small with sloping roof.",4,2010,05,31
115,Loved it,I stayed here just for one night with my husband and two small kiddies. We had the Studio Suite and it was so lovely! The staff were very accommodating and provided a travel cot for the little one. Luxurious and comfortable. As the kids slept I watched a movie in the bath and then relaxed on the lovely chairs and flicked through all the magazines! Bliss! Watch out for the Nespresso machine its sooo loud.. :),5,2010,05,24
115,Disappointing given the positive reviews,"My client suggested this hotel, which is not that far (15 minute walk) to their office.  I took a taxi and recognized the hotel as a form Jury's Inn that I'd stayed at a couple of years earlier.  My heart sunk as I remembered the former hotel.  Dark, tired room, gym wasn't available, good breakfast.  You have to carry your bags from the street up to the lobby level to check in.  It was a hotel I wouldn't have stayed at again.

The lobby seemed to have been upgraded so I asked the woman at reception who said that they whole hotel had been given a renovation.  This room was better than the one I remember (probably refreshed) and the gym is now available.  The good news:  Internet and breakfast were part of the room rate.  However, the room was still pretty dark (a common failing of hotels) and the water in the bathroom was lukewarm at the tops.  I asked if this could be fixed and it was.  The breakfast was identical to the one I'd had at the Jury's version.  Internet didn't work immediately and I called the front desk.  A manage was going to come by, but it started working as I played with it.  The internet was wired and not wifi, which is not a big issue.  I needed to print something out.  There was a printer downstairs in the lobby.  The internet connection on that was the speed of molasses and the printer ran out of ink while I was printing.  The Bloomsbury is not a bad hotel, but it does not in my mind match the reviews it is getting.  I'd probably try another area hotel before staying here to see which was better.",3,2010,05,23
115,You Can Walk From Here to (Almost) Anywhere,"I booked my stay at this property based exclusively on the reviews on Trip Advisor - and more specifically because I saw that the manager of the hotel cared enough to log on and read the opinions of his guests.  I am working on my Masters Degree in Museum Studies and this hotel was perfectly located.

The hotel's website is gorgeous and easy to manage and that is where I booked my room.  I will list my few disappointments first - but as you can see from my rating, my overall stay was good. 
 
1.   The room was small and did not match exactly what I had viewed online.
2.   My room could have used a bit of spot cleaning of the walls and carpets.
3.   Housekeeping could have been a bit more careful with the cleaning of the room.  (I used a cup from the service tray which a housekeeper returned to the tray without washing.)  I will attribute this to an honest mistake on the person's part, but it made me a bit - squeamish.

If property managers wonder why we do not report every real or imagined infraction it is because we want to get away from these events rather than highlighting them.

Now for the great part of the review.

1.  The front desk helped me by allowing me to check in early which was important after flying for 7 1/2 hours from New York.
2.  The Concierge team was wonderful.  When my laptop's power cord did not fit properly, I was immediately given an adaptor.
3.  The hotel is two blocks away from the British Museum and quite literally in walking distance to Picadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square, South Hampton Row (part of Bloomsbury - pictures included).  
4.  The hotel is near every imaginable restaurant, near drug stores (Boots and Super Drug), supermarket chain (Waitrose), and convenience store chain (Sainsbury).  Of course there are also Starbuck's coffee shops and Pret a Manger sandwich shops..
5.  There is a lobster bisque in the Landseer restaurant (in the hotel) that is simply divine - I just wish one did not have to hear the noise from the bar which faces and is open to the restaurant area.
6.  Comfortable night's rest.
7.  Free Internet.  (Some hotels in New York state charge an exorbitant daily fee for Internet usage.)
8.  Located within walking distance of the many museums and galleries I needed to visit including the Wallace Collection at Marshall Square.  (An absolute must visit even if you do not usually go to art galleries or museums.)

Where one stays and the quality of that stay is critical to the trip.  If anyone books at this hotel, I think they will be satisfied -- and I also believe any complaints will be taken seriously by the front desk and acted upon.",4,2010,05,18
115,Perfect location for travelling around the capital,"We stayed here over the bank holiday in April, and all in all had a great time. The hotel was in a fantastic location close by Tottenham Court tube station and as we booked it from laterooms we got it at a great price.

We have a couple of fair observations, both good and not so good...

Good - location / we could check in early / the bar was lovely with a great selection / the communal areas were fantastic / the decoration was very high quality / the consierge was very helpful / room service was really good / all staff were very polite

Not so good - the rooms were small (but expected in London) / lighting in the room was poor / not enough wardrobe space / noisy neighbours (not the hotels fault) / B&B was continental (not specified when booking)

All in all we would recomend it to visitors who are going to spend most time out and about as for the price the location couldn't be beaten.

Enjoy!",4,2010,04,30
115,Wonderful Hotel,"We had stayed at this hotel before they had remodeled all the rooms, and I liked it then.  Now it is 100% better.  All the rooms have been redone. They are lovely and everything is brand new and spotless. This is a very quiet hotel.  The concierge staff are very helpful and follow through on any request. There is a computer in the lobby that you can use for free internet service. If breakfast is not included in the price of the room, it is too high.  We went right around the corner by the tube station to Garfunkels where we had breakfast for 10 pounds for two.  This hotel is only a couple minutes walk to the tube.  I definitely would stay here again.",5,2010,04,29
115,"First Class Hotel in Convenient, Central Location","Spent two nights at the Bloomsbury Hotel on a family city break with our two young children.  

Reception was efficient and friendly, and I was pleased that we could check-in mid-morning and go straight to the rooms.  The receptionist ensured that we had two adjacent rooms (425 and 426), which were located at the end of a quiet corridor.  Both rooms were comfortably and stylishly furnished, and spotlessly clean, as were the en-suite bathrooms.  Note: I'm pretty sure that this hotel only has double-bedded rooms, ie no twins.  We all slept very well and weren't disturbed by any noise from passing traffic or other guests.

The hotel is in a great location: approximately 2 minutes walk from Tottenham Court Underground, and 5 minutes walk from the British Museum (turn right out of hotel).  We were booked into the hotel on a room only basis, and decided not to have breakfast at the hotel as the children only wanted a light bite.  We ended up at Cafe Rouge, which is opposite the entrance to Tottenham Court Underground, sharing baskets of pastries and croissants, and enjoying cappuccinos and hot chocolates: all for under £25 for 4 of us.

I spent hours researching hotels in London for our family trip and am very pleased with my choice.  Next time I won't have any work to do, as we'll definitely be staying at the Bloomsbury!",5,2010,04,25
115,A beautiful building,"I wanted to spend a couple of nights here on a recent trip to London as the original building was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens who is the architect of among other things, the stunning Thiepval Memorial to the Missing on the Somme in France. And it is a beautiful building and especially the lobby and hall ways have that lovely colonial luxe ambience. And indeed, the staff are eager to help. The rooms are delightfully decorated and have quality bathroom products. There is free internet access in one's room which is an absolute bonus compared to some bigger hotels who want to charge you 15 pounds a day for the privilidge.  There is a nice bar and restaurant. The latter has a very good pre theatre menu for those who need to eat and go. And indeed, the hotel is a walk to the theatre district...as it is to the British Museum which is just up the street. I think if you get a good rate this is a really lovely hotel and most people will enjoy staying here",3,2010,04,18
115,"Great hotel, made our stay in London complete","Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights.  Had already booked it before we read some bad reviews about it on trip advisor. I have to say we disagree with the bad reviews that we read.  On entering the hotel we were met by a very helpful concierge team, then greeted by a friendly receptionist.  Rooms were fab and exactly what we had seen on the photos when we booked it.  Breakfast, although not the variety we have seen in other hotels, was adequate, and staff were friendly and prompt to serve us.  In the bar the barman was very friendly, took the ladies coats and recommended some places for us to go that night.  We also booked tickets for some sights through the hotel, which was hassle free.  All in all would like to say a big thank you to all the hotel staff, we had a very enjoyable stay.",5,2010,04,13
115,The best place to stay if you want to be close to Oxford St and stay in style,"We stayed here as a treat to ourselves after 6 weeks travelling throughout Europe.  It was a little more than we spent for accommodation everywhere else, but was a great way to end our trip.  The hotel was beautiful and elegant, the staff were most helpful and the location was perfect.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2010,04,11
115,Relaxing hotel right in the centre of London,"We stayed at the Bloomsbury  from 7 - 9th April and had a brilliant time. The hotel was literally just around the corner from the theatre we were going to, The Dominion  for 'We will rock you'. We had a lovely meal at Cafe Rouge (right next to the theatre) - the only reason we didn't eat in the restaurant was that it was empty and i would rather not eat in an empty restaurant. Tottenham Court Road tube station was just 2 minutes away, as were numerous shops and restaurants. The staff were efficient and friendly, the continental breakfast was varied and fresh. The bed was so comfortable with lovely pillows and a large flat screen tv on the wall. The bathroom was clean and smart with a great power shower; it was a real treat to have the luxurious complimentary toiletries. The only improvement i can suggest is to improve the lighting above the mirror. It was difficult to do make up and hair with the light above the dressing table being so dim. Keep up the good work at the Bloomsbury, will recommend you to friends.",5,2010,04,10
115,If you want a feel of a British Hotel with all the modern appointments this is the hotel to choose.,"I almost did not stay at the Bloomsbury Hotel because of a couple of reviews that were posted on tripadvisor...I printed the reviews and took them with me in case I had some issues at the hotel. I immediately threw the negative reviews away...Not only were the staff friendly and helpful but they were quick to change my room when I pointed out I was given a smoking room...I never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a cab that the valet happily found for me...directions to museums, shopping, and the theatre were easy to understand...and my taxi for the airport arrived exactly at 12:30...

My hotel room was great...wonderful bed...modern bathroom, ample closet with ironing board and hairdryer and plenty of space to hang everything...you might want to make sure what size room you are getting...I know I will always make sure that it is the same size as room 214...because I plan on staying at this hotel from now on...if you like to shop, go to the theater, and visit museums this is the hotel for you...everything is literally a few blocks away but the hotel is situated on a street that is so quite and does not have a lot of pedestrian or vehicle traffice.

I have stayed at two other highly rated hotels that were very disappointing...I guarantee you will be very happy with this hotel!",5,2010,04,08
115,Nice Hotel!,I stayed 6 nights at the Bloomsbury Hotel. I enjoyed the hospitality and overall friendliness of the hotel staff. The hotel is in a convenient location to tube stations and Oxford Street. In general it was quiet and comfortable,5,2010,04,07
115,"Very central, reasonable and very plush","Would recommend this as a place to stay if you are looking for central hotel, very close the theater district, whilst retaining a nice, quiet, outlook.

The bar area and the reception where both excellent, well furnished and presented with a touch of a classical look, whilst the rooms where a decent size, and nice new fixtures and fittings.",4,2010,04,06
115,Perfect location and friendly staff,"My husband and I stayed for one night in this perfectly located and highly recommended hotel. 5-10 minutes from Oxford Street, Soho, Covent Garden...We arrived around 11 am and were able to check in early. Great. Receptionist and concierge were very helpful and friendly throughout our stay. The room was quite small (but definitely okay compared to other London hotels). It was perfectly clean, nicely decorated and well maintained. The bed was okay - the pillows were fantastic. Only complaint about the room is the lack of hooks for towels in the bathroom and the fact that the mixer tap in the shower which was quite diffucult to work out. The complimentary shampoo and shower gel were very nice. We had a very nice experience at The Bloomsbury and will hopefully be back soon.",5,2010,04,06
115,Loved it!,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in March/April. I could not fault the hotel at all.
The location of the hotel is perfect, just a few minutes walk from Tottenham Court Road Tube station in one direction, and in the other, it is 5 minutes to The British Museum and Bloomsbury. 
We ate in the hotel restaurant on both nights, the food was very good. On the second night, we had the pre-theatre dinner, it was excellent value for money and had good choice. I would definately recommend that you eat in the hotel restaurant at least once during your stay! The breakfast was also very good, the buffet had a large selection and although we did not have the cooked breakfast it certainly filled us up for the day ahead!
The room we had was lovely and had everything you would need, it was very quiet and had a very large, comfortable bed, and the decor was very nice.
The staff in the hotel were all very friendly and helpful, nothing seemed too much trouble for them. We had a very warm welcome when we arrived at the hotel, and were offered hot towels to freshen up as we checked in.
All in all, despite the awful weather, we had a wonderful few days in the capital and I would not even consider staying in another hotel when I next visit London... I highly recommend The Bloomsbury Hotel!",5,2010,04,05
115,THE PERFECT PLACE TO STAY IN LONDON,"A really brilliant hotel, perfect location, excellent staff, exceptionally clean.We had a really brilliant weekend staying in a large family room. Really quiet inside despite the central London location. Breakfast was a delight and the concierge a real asset. One of the best hotels I have stayed in, definitely recommend!",5,2010,03,31
115,V.Friendly hotel - great service & character,"Stayed at this hotel for a weekend break with my young children in room 101 - plenty of space and v.comfortable with a great location. Concierge on arrival could not have been more helpful and although room was not ready on arrival, made sure our clothes were in the room when we came back and had been hung in the wardrobe. Breakfast each morning was excellent and really set us up for the day - the staff were very attentive throughout and gave good advice as to where to go. It worked for me with children, however, would definitely return as a business person without as it is a litrel gem tucked away behind Oxford Street / Tottenham Ct Road",5,2010,03,31
115,Good but could be greener,"Very convenient to Tottenham Court Road tube station. I'm not sure I would choose this area again, but it's a short walk to Soho and beyond. The British museum is 100 meters down the road.
The Bloomsbury is a 5 star luxury hotel, very low key, small and boutique. My room on the 6th floor was very small (normal for London), luckily I was alone. The room was very clean, free broadband connection, flat screen TV. The bathroom is very small, even the shower over the bath felt very narrow. Again, everything very clean - nice toiletries but no conditioner...
The overall mood is  quite conservative, and aside from the receptionist, I found the rest of the staff rather cool. No one helped me with my bags checking in (up a short flight of stairs) and no one other than reception even acknowledged me. Polite but not friendly or welcoming.
I had some issues with the bathroom, the basin sink plug stuck in so I had to clean my teeth over the bath. They did try to fix this as soon as notified, and they did offer to change my room when they couldn't. I felt changing rooms was more hassle than the basin not working. It was fixed the next day. The bathroom tap fittings are a case of design over function. Very hard to work out how to turn the water on - probably complicated by the fact that the tap fitting was not installed correctly - so to turn the water off, I had to select bath. Again, this was fixed the next day.
I also found the lighting infuriating. To turn on the bedside light, I had to get the exact configuration of master light, secondary light, then only would the bedside light turn on. The master light is not labeled and is beside the entrance door. Very frustrating. Again, design looks wonderful, but a couple of signs would have helped!
Lastly, the hotel should adopt a few more green friendly things - a simple sign to place on the bed to say I'm happy to sleep in the same sheets again? As another mentioned, the bed was very, very comfortable. There was tea and coffee, but the kettle doesn't have a plug near by, so had to plug it in on the bedside table. A few shortbread biscuits are included, very happy to have those when waking at 2.30am with jet lag.
There is a restaurant and bar downstairs, food is OK ( I only ate in the bar ) - a bit expensive but OK if you don't want to go out. Again, service is polite, but not friendly.
If you are fussy about hotels, I'm sure this will meet your standards. I had a very friendly rate through a corporate account, it's not a cheap hotel but it is a good one.
Hotel quality is there but they could work on the friendliness and the 'green' options.",4,2010,03,27
115,Good hotel in general although disappointed with treatment from reception staff,"Really good location. Two minutes from the tube. Five minutes walk to Soho and ten or so to Covent Garden.  Nice little bar downstairs and breakfast was very nice.  Nice realaxed atmosphere.  Best thing was location and Temple Spa products in bathrooms.  Worst thing was the farse we had with reception on first night.  We arrived at ten pm and had booked a superior room (standard for this hotel). Given the late hour, I asked if an upgrade was possible and was told it was.  Unfortunately, we were placed in a room which appeared of less quality than the standard room we had originall booked.  The luxury room was supposed to have robes and a coffee machine.  When I called down to reception to ask about these, I was told that we were in a disabled room and that it therefore did not come with the coffee machine nor the robes! I was rather perplexed at this. Disable guests ought to have the exact same facilities should they not!  In addition,the room had no disabled facilities whatsoever and was not wheel-chair friendly.  I felt like I had been lied to and was a little confused.  I complained the next morning about the receptionist's remarks, which I found offensive and was subsequently told by another receptionist that it was not a disabled room.  She apologised for the previous receptionist. We were moved to a standard room which was by far superior to the box room we had been given.  I would rather they had said no to the upgrade than give us a room which was below par to the room we had actually booked.
If it had not been for this incident, I would have rated this hotel more highly.
Great place to stay.  Just don't ask for an up-grade!",3,2010,03,22
115,"Central, simple, functional","Good location, decent value for London.  Room was adequate and clean with a few fresh updates.  Did the trick.",3,2010,03,15
115,Great Location,"I stayed at the Bloomsbury for three nights in late January/early February. First impressions were great as I arrived about 6.45am after the long flight from Australia to a cold, snowy London morning and they had a room available for me straight away. The early check-in was fantastic - unlikely to be available in busier times, but very much appreciated and the young lady on reception was very pleasant. The hotel itself is fine and the rooms a reasonable size by London standards. Without doubt, the best feature is the location. just 5 minutes to the British Museum or to the start of Oxford Street and direct access to Tottenham Court Rd and the tube. This was not my first stay in London but this would be a great hotel for first-timers due to the location. Tottenham Court Rd tube station is just round the corner, with one change to Heathrow.

A couple of gripes. The bar fridge has no space for private drinks/food. It is one of the automatic types, with everything taken out automatically added to your bill - hate that. The bathroom, while adequate, had two really annoying design faults. The water and heat settings for the shower were of the engraved type - I had to get into the shower and nose up to the taps to see what was what. The bathroom mirror had no lights above it and I'm sure this would drive ladies nuts.

Overall a great location for the price but with some annoying little niggles.",4,2010,03,15
115,"Comfortable Luxury, and Great Location","Had a great stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel for a business trip.  It's located on a nice, quiet, quintessential London street.  But don't read that and think it's in a deserted area.  Far from it.  In fact, it's on the same street as The British Museum (less than a five minute walk.  It's literally down the street).  And, it's a short walk to the popular shopping streets of Oxford and Regent, not to mention close to the West End theaters.

Like many London hotels, the rooms are not huge.  But what they lack in size, they make up for in comfort and design.  Very sophisticated lighting, flat panel TV on the wall, great furniture, clean carpeting, and a ridiculously comfortable bed.  The bathroom walls are all marble.  The floor?  HEATED tile.  Such a nice feature!

The hotel also boasts a highly regarded restaurant.  Breakfast was included in my rate, and it was a really nice spread!  You could help yourself to the continental buffet, as well as order off the menu... all included.  (You have to ask if breakfast is included with your room rate, though -- not all rooms come with it).  

What I liked most about this hotel is that it has character.  It's not this huge, overbearing building, whose best feature is its exterior.  No.  This hotel has a great, sophisticated exterior, and that character continues on the interior, as well as in the guest rooms.

I highly recommend this hotel, both for business and for pleasure.",4,2010,03,14
115,Only one word-Great!,"I arrived at the hotel on Mar 4 in the noon. They have already cleaned up my room and I can check in right away. The room is not big but comfortable. The bathroom is small but clean. 
The location is very good. Go out from the entrance of the hotel, turn left twice, the entrance of central line tube is over there. China town is just one stop distance. Near the tube station, there are a lot of restaurants. Just 5 minutes walk to British Museum.
As an asian, the only thing I have to complain is breakfast. They have a lot of bread few salty food. But that is just a very small problem. Fried eggs tasted very good and the brown roasted toast also great.
It is a very great place to stay in London.",5,2010,03,14
115,"Lovely Hotel, Great Location!","Easy to find from Tottenham Court Rd Tube.
Friendly staff on arrival, checkin no problem.
Spacious, clean room.
Nice bar downstairs, bit pricey but nothing new there!
Great for Theatre visits, located in middle of theatreland.
Would recommend and visit again!",4,2010,03,09
115,"Stunning Hotel, shame about the service...","My boyfriend and I stayed at the Bloomsbury as a treat for his birthday. I wanted to book something extra special for him and the Bloomsbury seemed like the perfect choice, so I paid £330 for a suite, including breakfast. The first thing I must say is that this is a truly beautiful hotel in a great location. From the lobby to the corridors to our fantastic room, all was stunning. The suite was a good size, on the corner of the building, so we had lots of light coming in from 2 sides. The bed was huge, as was the TV and the wonderful bathroom, which had a free-standing bath, tv set into the wall, separate shower and heated floor. We were very happy customers.
Unfortunately, the entire experience was spoilt by the couldn't-care-less attitude of the staff. The front desk receptionist, although not rude, wasn't exactly pleasant either, not once did she crack a smile. When asked for directions to the Lansdeer Restaurant, the porter mearly grunted 'downstairs, on the right', again with no smile.
The Lansdeer was an experience in itself. After waiting a few minutes by an empty front desk, we were eventually shown to our table. It was early and the place was quite empty, but the next two couples to come in were sat right next to us, on tables so close together you could hear eachothers conversations even at a whisper, which meant I actually felt uncomfortable talking to my boyfriend. Very odd considering there were so many other empty tables. Food was ordered and bread rolls were brought over with some butter...but I did not have a butter knife. The food was of a good standard but 4 large, unused wine glasses and the bread board were not taken away at any point, making our already cramped table even more so. Service was slow, staff were grumpy, the place has no atmosphere, other than an awkward one.
Breakfast in the morning was much of the same, but the staff were worse. There wasn't much in the way of choice if you didn't want a cooked breakfast and I had to wait for a member of staff to dish up their own breakfast before I could get to the fruit myself. The awful waitress we had practically threw the toast and plates onto our table and we had to listen quite hard to understand her bored mumbling. Her English was awful, amazing considering she was actually English. The place also had the atmosphere of a wake, not really what you want at breakfast!
As I said, it is a beautiful place, in a great location. If only they could get better staff, it might actually be the perfect hotel.",3,2010,03,09
115,"With friendlier, more helpful staff this could be a fantsatic hotel...","This hotel is really lovely and is in a great location for getting to and from Kings Cross and around London. The rooms were of  a good stndard and although we didn't eat there we also heard good things about the restuarant and the food. 

The one thing that could potentially ruin this hotel is the staff. Were they friendlier and more helpful this would be somewhere which I would look forward to returning to and it would make the difference from this hotel feeling like a little overpriced average hotel with quite nice rooms to a luxury hotel, to which it already claims to be.

On check in we didnt get a smile, a please or a thank you and it was the same when checking out. Also, a note for anyone who finds themesleves staying in rooms 612-615, you may have to figure out a 'secret' door to find your room- something else that we were not told about on reception. I paid with a debit card not a credit card which meant that I had to pay for things rather than charging them to our room which in itself is not a problem, however when we came back to the hptel after an evenbing out, our mini-bar which had been open when we left had been locked. Maybe this is hotel policy but it felt like we were sudenly in the 'cheap seats'.  

The hotel was part of a treat of a weekend away and I wanted it to feel like that, a treat! but the hotel really didn't. 

All this said, if there was a deal on I would go back and stay here but for the same price I think we could have stayed somewhere much nicer where they appreciate that the making of a good otel lies in the smaller and simple touches...maybe they could start with an occasional smile!",3,2010,03,08
115,Room good but breakfast disappointing,"When we booked it stated breakfast included. When we got to breakfast we found it was only continental, not the full English. The service was appalling, staff were surly and disinterested. It was a real shame as the room was very nice and the hotel beautiful. We wouldn't go back.",3,2010,03,05
115,"Perfect locale, perfect hotel. A few things needing sorted though.","The hotel is beautifully decorated and in a fantastic central location. The staff i found were generally very professional. Joshua & Paulo are extremely helpful on the concierge desk, a real credit to the hotel. The grumpy old man of a night porter (not the mustached gentleman but the foreign national, he needs to go to charm school). The executive room allocated to us was small but was clean, smart and sell looked after. The heating system even when switched off is very noisy and annoying especially at 3am. The tv in the room doesnt always work either.",3,2010,03,02
115,Pleasant hotel with fantastic staff.,"Just stayed for a couple of days while on a business trip with 10 partners.

Hotel is nice, though the room I had was a bit small. Unlike many other hotels, my room came with an iron and ironing board, full tea and coffee making facilities. Toiletries are ok and the bathroom clean and with an excellent shower. Looking at the room menu wine lists I noticed that the prices (while not cheap), were certainly good value: especially for London. The central airconditioning was easy to use and the TV had plenty of channels. WiFi internet was free (I hate places that ""nickle and dime"" you for 15-30quid a day) and very fast. My room was opposite the elevators but I never heard it through the solid door (nor did I hear any activity from the other guests).

We didn't eat at the Landseer restaurant in the Hotel, but spent a fair amount of time in the bar. There we met Igor Beaulieu; Manager of the Landseer British Kitchen. He made probably the best martinis we had ever drunk (gin or vodka), as well as sublime mojitos and arguably the best margarita in London. The bar has a great atmosphere: friendly and cosy and not sterile or intimidating.

Apart from one new lad behind the bar (who was honest and brave enough to tell us that he didn't know any restuarants in the area, but would find out for us) , everyone knew the area and had suggestions. Igor again proved the best though: phoning several restaurants on our behalf before managing to get us a table at the (difficult) time we wanted. 

Because it was walking distance rather than a taxi he insisted on walking us there to ensure we wouldn't get lost in the rain (and he provided umbrellas). 2 minutes and several turns down narrow roads later we are at the restaurant: one which is now on my top 5 places for dinner in the UK!

Will I return? Certainly. This hotel has plenty to recommend it and is cheaper than hotels where I normally stay (around the Lloyds building), but only a tube or 8 quid taxi fare from the centre of the insurance area, making it an excellent alternative. It is also 2 minutes walk from the British Museum and several of the major shows.",5,2010,02,20
115,Everything Just A Little Average and Below Par,"I'd done my research and having one free night with a points program, we stayed here for 2 nights in December (effectively getting for 1/2 price but it was still about £200).  We did get upgraded when we arrived but I failed to see what the difference was as the room, with no view, seemed pretty much like the one I'd booked.
The facilities do look nice enough and the room as been fairly well appointed with espresso maker, flat screen, nice bed, desk, etc. but on further inspection, it's just a little shabby, especially the bathroom in which the sink faucent was loose, and the carpets leading into it frayed.
The electricals alongside the desk weren't working and the hotel thoughtlessly has sockets which aren't standardised UK or US sockets (looks like UK socket but round pin on the ground) so we were left with one electrical outlet.
I really expected this hotel to just give a bit more for the price and the reputation but overall, it all just seemed a bit dated and in need of an overhaul.
Great location though!",3,2010,02,07
115,Good quality and Location.,"This is a very nice hotel.  Front desk lovely, smiley faces and very helpful.  The Concierge is brilliant, always willing to help everyone, so much so, that even on one occasion when we had to queue to see him, we didn’t mind as we could see he was genuinely helping other people staying at the hotel.

The hotel has a luxury/business feel so it will suit all those seeking a good standard stay as well as those coming for business into central London.  We came for sight seeing and its perfect for this.

The front lounge area is a little on the small size but adequate for chilling out or reading the days newspaper.  We were quickly checked in and our luggage was taken to the room by the bellboy.  Good service.  

The room we booked was a suite room.  Although it was high up in the hotel, it didn’t have fantastic views but from this location, there isn’t much to see so no complaint there.  The room is large and well equipped with a good comfortable sized bed (two twins next to each other).  There is a whopping 42inch LG lcd tv which is on a swivel stand which can be rotated to face the bed or the seating area in the suite.  There are ample connections for hooking up dvd, playstation, and even a MP3 player if you wanted to use the tv speakers – saves carrying silly little speakers.  There is a large working desk area and a very large wall covering mirror – see the pics.  I have to say, the room is just as illustrated on the internet.  The bathroom had a bath with tv in the tiles complete with remote control!  This was brill and a first I have seen in any hotel we have stayed in.  It also has a power shower which was brill with side jets and heated floor.  Very impressed.  The feel is very modern and luxurious.  The toiletries are by Temple Spa and very nice to use.

The chill out area had a nice large coffee table and two loungers where we enjoyed our drinks and also in room breakfast.

There is ample wardrobe space for a couple staying for a week.  The minibar has cans of soft drinks such as coke, lemonade etc but no alcohol.  There was also tea/coffee making facilities.

Breakfast in the dining area was very nice.  A full breakfast is made to order and comes on hot plate.  My wife ordered a made to order omelette and it was very nice.  All the ingredients were of very good quality, from the bacon to hash browns etc.  No cheap food here!  Also, there was a very good open buffet of cereals, fruit, yoghurts, continental breakfast, nuts, eggs, fruit juice etc etc.  There was lots on offer.

We found all the staff in the hotel to be very courteous and helpful.  The in room service was very good too.  We ordered breakfast as room service on one morning and it came up very hot and there was ample amount of food.

We had a slight problem in that we could not get our laptop to recognise the wired internet option in our room but this was probably our fault as we are not IT specialists.  The hotel duty manager was good enough to come up and have a look but no joy.  There is however wireless interest available in main lounge area and we saw many other guests using it no problem.  

London has many dated and old fashioned hotels but this is not one of them.  Its had a recent refurb and the staff from the dining area to front desk were very helpful and friendly.  My wife and I would definitely stay again when back in London.

Location wise, its around the corner from Tottenham court road station and walking distance to Covent Garden, Oxford Street, Leicester Square, Trafalgar Square.  If you are an able walker, you could walk to Big Ben, past 10 Downing Street and even as far as the London Eye.  Its far better to walk and take in all the sights!  Especially if you are snap happy like me.  Covent garden and Leicester Square are about ten mins away on foot, another five mins to Trafalgar Square and another ten mins to Big Ben.

A really good hotel with good service and very good location-would easily return to stay here on our next visit to London.",5,2010,02,03
115,Highly Recommended,"My boyfriend, two other friends & I had a fantastic stay here in Oct last year. I cant say enough about the lovely time we had, from a warm greeting from the lovely Kasha (apols if I have spelt your name incorrectly), Upgrade, Dinner reservations, Comfy pillows and tasty brekkie. This is a great place to base any trip to London from. The city is easily accessed via various tube, bus routes and walking. I am planning a return trip very soon to catch the new Phantom of the Opera Musical. Cant wait.",5,2010,02,02
115,Good Stay,"We initially booked this hotel for early jan but due to the weather condition had to modify our booking and the fare was more expensive. I did receive a confirmation by email and when i called 2days prior our arriving, they told me there was no booking made for these days. Anyway, after investigating, they later wrote back to me stating the mistake was on their end and would be happy o offer me a room with the initial rate that was given to me early january. When arriving to the hotel around 1pm, we had to wait for our room to be ready. My partner had asked for a smoking room. After 30min we were on our way to the room and when opening the door, old tobacco smelled filled the entire place. It was disgusting. We opened the windows, and left to walk around in the shopping streets. We came back around 7pm and again, the terrible smell had not disappeared. At that point, i didnt think i could take it so i called the reception and asked if we could swith to a non smoking room, asking them to verify how strong the smell was. I went down to the receptionist and she gave me a new room key and appologised for the disconfort. 
After that, all was nice. The rooms may not be very large but the design is modern with warm colours. I would go back to this hotel, the staff is pleasant and accomodating, and the location is perfect.",4,2010,02,01
115,lovely hotel great location,we arrived at the bloomsbury on a friday afternoon we were well looked after on check in  it was my husbands birthday so we were upgraded (thank you)our room was fabulous really spacious and luxurious loved it had a few drinks in bar over our stay but word of warning had a baileys coffee and was charged £9.50 bit steep!!also i know concierege prob on commission for ordering taxi but we were stung £18 with hotel taxi and £11 for black cab just for future ref other than that well looked after great location 5mins walk to oxford st soho and not much further for convent garden and the rest so thank again to all the staff at the bloomsbury,5,2010,01,26
115,excellent location,"Our stay was pleasant , the room (on the 8th floor-smoking) was spacious but a bit dark.
The location of the hotel is excellent. We were surprised by the breakfast - thank God we got english breakfast cause the continenantal was rather poor . 
Room service was very good , try the afternoon tea - worth it",5,2010,01,22
115,Great location and lovely hotel let down by front desk,"5 mins walk to Tottenham Court Rd tube station.  Beautifully decorated hotel, nice bar, rooms well appointed if a little cold.  Concierge friendly and helpful.  However we were disatissfied by the cold manner of the reception staff.  On checking in, one receptionist was on the phone to her bank checking her account in full view of guests.  The lady who served us did not smile once and barely looked at us whilst taking our credit card.  I work in the customer service industry,  so poor service always effects my choice of hotel.  Great location let down by service.",3,2010,01,22
115,Messed about and then downgraded !,"We have stayed here before and were impressed, however after the last stay just before Christmas I think we’ll be going elsewhere in future. The room had been booked for 2 months and was lovely – even if the view was just down one of the tiny side streets. We had trudged up from Southwark in torrential sleet so we thought we would have a bit of a relax and a nap after check-in before going out for something to eat. My wife and I awoke after about half an hour and the room was very chilly – which wasn’t great because she was coming down with a cold. I checked the heating controls and there was an ominous spanner flashing on the display. A call to reception led to an engineer eventually arriving and then disappearing again. After another half an hour of waiting and we finally decided to give up and hit the town. At reception, they told us that they were still trying to fix the heating in that section of the hotel and if, when we got back, they had failed they would move us to another room as “ we’ve got plenty available.“

We got back at about 10.30pm and were allocated another room. So we had to grab all of our stuff and trudge up 4 floors to the new one. This room was considerably different to our first one. Much smaller, it appeared to be located in the very innards of the hotel as the view wasn’t even to the outside, just some grim interior service courtyard. And to make matters worse, although the heating certainly worked, it sounded like a jumbo jet taking off and we had to turn it off once we went to bed. We were so tired, we couldn’t be bothered to complain. To add insult to injury, the room opposite ours acquired it’s occupants at about 2.30am and they weren’t your shy retiring types lets put it that way. With their room service supper as well the din didn’t die down until about 4am.

So in a nutshell, messed about and then shunted off to an inferior box room opposite a couple of big mouths in an apparently largely empty hotel. How nice it would have to have been upgraded, just so the nasty taste left our mouths. Never mind – one votes with one’s feet as they say.",1,2010,01,22
115,Nice Hotel but Deluxe room very Small,We booked a deluxe and while the room was decorated lovely we felt it was very small for a deluxe room in general. Would hate to see a standard size room!  It was advertised on their website as a totally different room and a lot bigger. The bathroom was very cold with no means of heating it.  In general our stay was good. Fantastic location for shopping in Oxford street and close to Leister Square and Soho. Tube Station right at the end of the road which took us everywhere within minutes.,4,2010,01,16
115,"Great Location, Lovely Rooms","We stayed at this hotel for our anniversary - absolutely loved the room; very cosy and comfortable.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The location was absolutely great...eveything was practically 5-10 minutes away so we has no problems getting anywhere.  Restaurants and bars were nearby too.  Room service was also great, food was nice.  There were a few hiccups with our breakfast; we has paid for it but for some reason was not recorded on the system - tried to resolve this but gave up in the end. Despite this, would definitely stay here again; it has already been recommended to a few friends.",5,2010,01,12
115,An absolute cracker of a hotel,"Wow!!!!!
Just got back from spending a few days at the Bloomsbury Hotel on Great Russell Street and have landed back to earth with a rather large bump.
The hotel, the perfect location, the room (with the heated floor in the bahroom), the Landseer bar, the Landseer restuarant, the food, the very helpful staff (special mention to Paolo at the concierge desk for getting us brilliant seats for We Will Rock You at the Dominion Theatre for Saturday night) were all absolutely perfect and I could not think of any way of improving on the experience we both had.
If you're looking for a reasonably priced, but very comfortable hotel which is quiet, bearing in mind your location, look no further than this place. And if you also like to ""take in a show"" as well as explore what London has to offer (mainly the shops), you can not find a better location.
Top marks all round and would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2010,01,10
115,Beautiful and well located hotel,Great Qualtiy:Price for a nice hotel that is extreemly well located. We booked our weekend on the web and there was an excellent package that we took. I would recommend it any time and will defineitely go back if I am back in London.,5,2010,01,02
115,Excellent Location,"The hotel is ideal for walking to covent garden, shaftesbury ave etc. We stayed for one night and paid £133 plus VAT for a double room. The room was nice and clean but quite dark. There was tea/coffee making facilities, bath and shower. There is a nice bar and restaurant, large lobby area where you can order drinks etc. when the bar is closed. Staff were friendly and helpful.",4,2009,12,15
115,excellent standard and location,"Fab hotel, would return again! Great location for Covent Garden, Soho, Oxford street.  Excellent rooms - comfiest bed I've ever slept in.  Plenty of bars and restaurants in area.",5,2009,12,11
115,LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This hotel is beautiful, warm and stylish and the staff are very friendly.  You enter the hotel to be greeted with a gorgeous huge reception area with lovely decor and beautiful fitments.
Our room was lovely and clean and well fitted.  They kept our party together so we were in adjoining rooms.
The breakfast was one of the best breakfasts Ive had - lots of choice - I had a homemade waffle and maple syrup!
The bar was atmospheric and stylish and the drinks were a good price for london I thought
Just one thing as mentioned by somebody else - the check in was quite late and our room wasnt ready.  When you've had a long journey I think 2 pm would be an acceptable checkin time!
In conclusion - a gorgeous place to stay!",5,2009,12,04
115,Overbooked - Disapointed,"We booked a room at the Bloomsbury specifically because of it's location - walking distance to theaters, restaurants, the musuem, etc.  We arrived early around 1PM and were told that our room was not ready yet, so we left our bags and went out for lunch.  When we returned we were told the hotel was overbooked and there was no room for us (we were also told that other people were in the same situation as some sort of consolation that we weren't the only people they did this to).   

While I think this is totally unacceptable, they did the only thing they could and re-booked us at their sister hotel, the Kensington.  That hotel was excellent, but it is in a completely different area of the city.  While they paid for a cab to take us to the other hotel to check in, we still had to pay for our transportation to go out in the evening because we couldn't walk to the restaurant/theater.  We also asked if they would compensate us for that, but they said no.

The final thing that bothered me about the whole situation was that when we arrived at the other hotel they booked for us, the front desk there seemed to have no idea about our situation or that they owed the cab driver for our fare.  They had to call back to the Bloomsbury to confirm our new reservation and made the cab driver wait to pay him (this was a bit uncomfortable).   The Bloomsbury could have called ahead to make sure that things went more smoothly.

So, they lobby looks very nice, but unfortunately we never got to see the rooms.",2,2009,12,02
115,Excellent Hotel in Central London,"First impressions count for a lot. From the moment the doors are opened for you by 2 doormen on your arrival you know you have arrived somewhere you want to stay. Reception was friendly and efficient and offered to help with theatre bookings, dinner bookings etc. Incredibly we were offered a smoking room which we took. This turned out to be on the top floor of the hotel but the speedy lifts made light work of that.
Stunning views from the window over the rooftops towards the BT Tower made me glad I am a smoker. The room was not large but was certainly adequate for our needs, after all how much time do you actually spend in your room when you are a tourist in London.
The room was clean and was cleaned every day of our stay, the bathroom had heated floor and heated mirror which is a godsend for shavers!
All the staff we met during our stay were friendly and approachable.
The location is excellent, within 2 minutes walk you can be in the British Museum or Oxford Street.
One word of caution, if you book through an agent such as Booking.com or Expedia keep your booking confirmation, you may need it. When we came to check out the hotel tried to charge us their standard rate which was £40 dearer than the rate we had got through the agent. If we had not had the agent's receipt we may have struggled.
Apart from that slight niggle we had an excellent stay at The Bloomsbury and would recommend it.",4,2009,11,26
115,The Bloomsbury gets it right,"We had a one night stay for a theatre trip and found  The  Bloomsbury excellent.  We were welcomed and all the staff were polite and friendly.  The room was spacious and clean. We decided to have the pre-theatre dinner in the hotel rather than hunt around for a place to eat, and were very glad that we did - the food was delicious, beautifully presented (and good value for money) and all the staff were very helpful. The breakfast buffet was a treat, and again we had excellent attention. Thank you Bloomsbury, we hope to do it again sometime.",5,2009,11,21
115,Looks beautiful but we had some problems,"We stayed here for one night.   We liked the style of the hotel, funky and really nicely furnished.   The building is beautiful and has plenty of historic features.

Our room wasn't ready when we arrived (after 3pm) which was disappointing but we were offered an upgrade to a suite (albeit a smoking room).  As non-smokers we were not really keen but wanted to get into the room and also were tempted by the upgrade! 

Although the room was pleasant and spacious, I would not describe it as a suite as it was similar in size and amenities to a deluxe room our friends were staying in.  There was a separate dressing room area and a part of the bedroom was set aside for two comfortable chairs.  The bathroom was lovely with separate shower and a large bath with a tiled-in TV.

Although we were happy with the room initially, later on we had problems with temperature - despite the air conditioning being set to the lowest temperature of 16 degrees celsius, the room was uncomfortably warm.  Unfortunately, as well as being ineffective, the air conditioning was very noisy.  Like some other hotels of this genre, the lighting was subtle (i.e. wholly inadequate) in the bedroom.

Our biggest problem was with the underfloor heating in the bathroom.  By the following morning the floor was so hot it was too hot to walk on.  It couldn't be controlled from inside the room and had to be adjusted from a cupboard in the hallway.  This did improve matters a bit but the whole room was made so unbearably hot we were glad to check out.   

Breakfast could only be described as chaotic.   There were insufficient numbers of staff, so that they did not have time to clear tables - one long table became a dumping ground as they - and other guests - cleared away used crockery.  It took nearly 15 minutes for us to get a menu and order tea/coffee.  When we eventually got our breakfast (which was perfectly nice), they further let themselves down by providing an empty bottle of sauce and leaving half-used pots of jam.

Overall, I would not return to this hotel.  We may have been very unlucky with room and breakfast but there are much better places to stay in London in the same price bracket.",3,2009,11,18
115,Beautiful place to stay,"I believe, staying at the Bloomsbury hotel has been a really good choice and not only due to its outstanding location: the decor of the rooms is quite sophisticated  and even the standard doubles have a design touch, often missing in other London hotels within a similar price range. The rooms are of a decent size and appear to be recently refurbished; the common areas look nice as well. The reception staff was quite helpful, which made my stay even more enjoyable.",5,2009,11,13
115,"Amazing room -decor, lighting, comfort!!!","We stayed overnight without breakfast, so don't know about the food BUT the room was amazing.   Very comfortable bed, quiet, ultra modern lighting, furnishing and decor but still cosy.   Air-conditioning kept room fresh at whatever temperature required and the bathroom was awesome with speakers from the tely relaying your favourite programme all tiled in marble and a bath with no taps -  that took a while to work out where the water came from.",5,2009,11,13
115,An oasis in the London hotel desert,"I was born in London well over seventy years ago but have lived in North America for 44 years. I return to the city every few years and have generally been disappointed at the low standards of hotel keeping in relation to the price.
The Bloomsbury was outstandingly good, and good value.
Check-in was easy after booking on the excellent website. The room was clean, and looked new, and was large by London hotel standards.
The 32"" LCD TV worked properly (sometimes they don't) and the room was quiet.
The bathroom (always a good criterion) was the most modern I have encountered in Britain, but I was unaccustomed to the taps which were, I think, German, and I would have appreciated an instruction diagram in the room brochure. Once I figured out the shower and the bathtub settings they worked perfectly.
A great hotel.",5,2009,11,07
115,almost right,"I am currently in one of the two rooms in the return beside the lift on the 7th floor. There is no noise from that but the floor of the room above creaks more than any I have heard in all my years of staying in hotels. The people last night didn't move around a lot but every move they did make was a creak. I coped and got to sleep but when the room started being cleaned at 10:10 this morning every move of the service was like it was happening beside me. Creak, creak, creak for 25 minutes. I'm not blaming the staff but it is annoying. The room we are in is very nice for a newly refurbished hotel but the little reading light attached to the bed doesn't work (right hand side). Does no-one notice things like the light switch is toltally recessed making it inoperative? Simple things like that should be checked each time a guest leaves. Sorry if this sounds like a bad review when I do like the place, the concenience, etc. I have stayed here many times and the Manager has even given us a special rate once due to prevoius problems so decided to give the new version a chance.  few simplethings would make this place perfect.",4,2009,11,07
115,"The perfect hotel, the perfect/classy spot in London.","The perfect location to visit, 5 minutes walk to everything; West end Shows, Oxford street shopping, great restaurants, subway station.  Excellent staff.  Perfect rooms. Everything the same as the pictures on the web site.",5,2009,11,04
115,Classy,"It is the small things set hotels apart - hot towels on arrival after a busy tube journey, a welcoming opened door and my favourite the heated bathroom floor. Turned out the door and within 5 mins I was looking at Egyptian mummies in the British Museum. Another small walk I was in Covent Garden. Perfect central location and will be back.",5,2009,11,01
115,Recommended place to stay in London,"Stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel on Great Russell Street, London for 2 nights over a weekend in mid October. My husband found the website and we liked the look of the hotel, and decided to book after reading the positive reviews on TripAdvisor.  Firstly, the Bloomsbury is a really lovely hotel, the staff who dealt with us (ie concierge and check-in staff) were very helpful.  We arrived too early to check in to our room but the staff were happy to let us drop off our bags and then return later.  Rooms were a little on the small side, but this is expected in a city where space is at a premium. The furnishings were great, particularly the large flat-screen TV, and the bathroom was excellent.  We didn't eat  breakfast there, but there are plenty of places to eat close by which aren't as expensive.  It's in a great location and very conveniently close to the Tottenham Court Rd tubestop.  Only minor fault would be that the AC/heating system in the room was a little noisy during the evening when trying to sleep, but didn't disturb us too much.  All in all, we enjoyed our stay at the Bloomsbury and would definitely return, and would also recommend it to friends.",4,2009,10,24
115,Fabulous!,"It was my husband's 50th and he didn't want to go abroad just for a few days so we decided on London.  We wanted to go and see We Will Rock You and be pretty central in London.  The Bloomsbury was just round the corner from the Dominion Theatre so I booked it on line directly with the Hotel.  They did a 'Stay & Rock' package for 2 nights including pre-theatre dinner with glass of wine and tickets.  The seats for the show are normally in the stalls but as it was a special birthday I asked if the tickets could be purchased in the stalls and I would pay the difference.  I was advised that the tickets had been purchased as requested and that I wouldn't have to pay any extra.  I was delighted.  When we got to the theatre we had front stall seats, couldn't have wished for better.  

The Hotel is lovely but I have to say I spent more on a 3 day break there than we did going to Barcelona for 4 nights in a 5* hotel last year.  However, I wouldn't have changed a thing.  It was clean, the food in the Hotel was excellent, we ate in the restaurant twice and were not disappointed at all.  The waiter in the restaurant in the evening was polite and helpful however the staff at breakfast seemed a bit miserable.  On the first morning I was told we had to pay for breakfast but advised the waiter we already had, it wasn't a problem though and we weren't asked again. Food was very good.

We only had one problem and that was on the first evening before our pre-theatre dinner I went to take a shower and the water was cold; it was also cold from the bath and the sink.  I rang reception 3 times but each time the line was cut off.  My husband went down to reception and was advised the Duty Manager would come and sort it out - he arrived within 5/10 minutes and sorted it out.

I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel and hope we will be able to afford it again one day.",4,2009,10,23
115,Excellent hotel,"My partner and I stayed at the Bloomsbury Hotel for 4 nights. The service upon arrival was very efficient, and we was given af room on the 2nd floor. The room was facing a wall, but that didn't bother us. The room was not very huge, but we had space enough for everything. The bathroom was very nice with a tub and a shower. The bed was very soft and comfortable.

The only ""bad"" thing about the room, was the speaker in the bathroom. First, the sound wasn't that good, and second, if you were watching tv late at night at a low volume, you could still hear it loud in the bathroom. We didn't knew if it bothered the neighbours.

The room we had, was VERY silent. The only noise we could hear, were from the other rooms, like people watching TV and people talking loud. The cleaning of the room was also excellent. We had breakfast in room one morning, which was very nice. The price was the same as if you were eating in the restaurant, and the breakfast arrived to our room at the chosen time.

The area around the hotel, was also fantastic. The Tottenham Court Road subway are just around the corner, and the Oxford Street, also just around the corner. We could walk the almost everywhere.

I would definately recommand this hotel. It is perfect for relax, sightseeing and shopping, and if (when)  we are going to London again, we would definately stay here again.",5,2009,10,22
115,"Room nice & elegant, housekeeping could use more training","The Bloomsbury Hotel is a lovely hotel with a great location.  We were able to walk everywhere and if we needed to take the tube, the Tottenham Court Road station was around the corner.   It is close to many great restaurants, coffee shops, theatres, and shopping.  The room was nice, thankfully we had a view of the street.  The alternative was a view of the closed courtyard and other rooms.   Housekeeping was not the best, after 4 nights we had to ask for a bedding change, towels were threadbare, and bathroom amenities sparse.   Also one issue with the Concierge, he sent us to the wrong address,  we requested directions to Fleet Street, we soon realized he gave us directions to Fifth Street, I suppose an understandable mistake.   With all that said, it is a  nice hotel and we  would happily stay there again.",4,2009,10,20
115,a real gem,"first time staying at the Bloomsbury and have to say,we were not dissapointed.The staff were very efficient and friendly.our room(212) was very comfortable and spotless,bathroom was very large and bright.Location wise,the hotel is a few mins from Oxford st and 5 mins from Soho so walkable to many great bars and eateries.
would have no hesitation in staying here again.",5,2009,10,20
115,great location,"My husband and i stayed here for my Birthday weekend.
The hotel is in a great location, round the corner from Oxford Street, not far from Regeant St and a few mins walk to Tottenham Court Road tube and within walking distance to Picadilly Circus.The hotel is large and nicely decorated, the majority of the staff are pleasant and polite.We stayed on the 7th floor , the room was of average size for London standards and was clean and well presented, the bathroom although small had all you would need....one small complaint was the shower, the shower head was full of limescale and dribbled water out of the head although the shower jets worked and you could have a decent shower, another small point is the shower screen isn't large enough and water does go everywhere!The air conditioning unit in my opinion is not strong enough to cope with the size of the hotel and at times felt like it was fighting a losing battle, and i don't know whether it was condensation or the unit was leaking but the floor of the bedroom was damp around the unit! However these are minor points as overall the room was what i expected for this standard of hotel and the colours and furnishings were nice!
I would recommend the cafes for breakfast as we ate breakfast in our room once and i am sorry but it was very expensive and whilst a one off was a ""treat"" ,i would be disappointed if i ate breakfast at the hotel for the rest of the stay.
I can recommend the indian restaurant opposite the hotel, it is a lovely Indian with great food , also the Restaurant ""Tas"" just up from the hotel, is very nice too!
The hotels concierge are great if you get lost, provide you with a map and we purchased our Bus tour tickets from them which are valid for 24hrs and show you London whilst allowing you to hop on and off the bus whenever you would like! 
The british museum is just up the road from the hotel and is great, and free.......which believe me you appreciate  as most attractions in London are expensive!!
The tower is great too and St Pauls catherdral.If you need any help the concierage provide you with any help that you may need, they are a good help!
Overall the hotel is of a good standard, great location and friendly staff......for London it did exceed my expectations!",4,2009,10,19
115,Disappointed,"We checked into the Bloomsbury today and I'm very disappointed with the room.  We decided to pay for a Deluxe Room because we wanted more space.  And after reading reviews on this website, we knew that the rooms sizes varied.  So when we checked in, we asked for one of the larger Deluxe rooms.  The front desk clerk told me that all the Deluxe rooms were large...in other words, the request wasn't really valid.  Well, we got to our room which was very nice, as other travelers have described. But our bathroom is the size of a postage stamp!  It is literally smaller that 8' x 6' !!!  And when we left our room to grab a bite, the inside door handle came off the door.  We called to have it fixed, which they handled promptly.  It would normally have only been an annoyance, but we were already feeling unhappy with the room, so  this just added further disappointment.  We have not been able to take a trip for several years, due to a family issue... so we were really looking forward to this experience. I'm afraid the hotel has certainly put a damper on things. I'm going to check with the front desk tomorrow and see whether there are any better Deluxe rooms available. We are here for 5 days, and twe do not look forward to using that small bathroom for that long.

PLEASE NOTE - I'm having trouble clicking on the ratings.  My overall rating is Poor.  I was trying to select Poor for Rooms and Value, but the web page is acting funny and will only take 4 or 5 circles, so I will just submit this review as is.",2,2009,10,13
115,Decent with some problems,"Firstly the location of the Hotel is fantastic, and the public areas are very open, bright and welcoming. Our room was not ready upon arrival, but we were there before the allocated check in time. 
The main dissapointment was our room. I had requested an upper floor room, which usually means brightness. However on this occasion we had a dark room with a window out to a wall. It was an end of corridor room, which left you with the impression of a garrett.
The other main problems were lighting in the room and temprature control. The lighting in the bathroom is too dim, and we struggled with the heat in the room. Even with the air con on full, it was still too warm for what was a very sunny day in London. 
As we were only staying one night, and were in a hurry we didn't have time to ask for a room change, so I would hope that our room was an exception?
Otherwise the furnishings etc, bed, aminities were great.",3,2009,10,10
115,central friendly clean,great hotel * central * good value * nice breakfast * thats the way i like it!,4,2009,10,08
115,"great location, modern decor, big rooms and hepful staff","We stayed here last night for the 3rd time, 2nd since the refit, and cannot fault the hotel.  The rooms are fairly big, for London, especially the bathrooms, decorated really lovely and the bed is more comfy than my room at home!  

Last night was the first time we have gone down to the bar which we found very comfy.  It's very hotel-ish with the Zero 7 music in the background etc but perfect for what we were after.  We had the steak sandwich and the duck wrap and were very happy with both.  The organic beer and red wine were good too!

All in all I think this hotel is a good all-rounder.",5,2009,10,05
115,Good value hotel for central London,"Stayed one night here on a Saturday night.  Booked through LateRooms for £135 (not including breakfast)
Generally a very nice stay.
Good points:
Newly decorated hotel and rooms were well appointed.
Staff extremely helpful
Location Excellent, close to shops, tube, west end, Covent Garden
Breakfast (which we paid an extra £15 for) was lovely, probably one of the nicest full english breakfasts I have had for a long time.
Not so good points:
Air conditioning on the 5th floor was very poor.  A member of staff admitted that the units are not powerful enough for the number of rooms on each floor.  We changed our room to the 8th floor (which has less rooms) and the AC was fine.
Shower was awful, incomprehensible array of knobs, water shot out everywhere except for the shower nossle",4,2009,09,29
115,"Amazing Place, Wonderful Staff, Beautiful Hotel, Just GREAT !!!!","We had a great stay at the hotel, the location is extremely good for shopping on Oxford Street, the theaters and night life. 
All the staff at the hotel were very friendly and welcoming, also the cleanliness of the bedrooms and public areas was excellent with great attention to details. 
Would highly recommend this hotel to for business travel or a luxury weekend break.",5,2009,09,28
115,Issues!,"Stayed here on a friday night, after travelling straight from work, i tried to check in and the lady gave me something to sign which had my surname on but had someone elses address, email and contact number, so i said i wait for my partner to get to the hotel as he had a reservation number..
Second time trying to check in and it was a different lady i explained what had happened and she still proceeded to try and check me with incorrect details, this stay was also for 2 nights and i was only staying for a night.. I asked them to call superbreaks(who i booked through) and she and another person on reception said they didnt have the number??? Fed up of waiting i decided to call them myself and managed to get things sorted- without much help from the staff! So we get to our room which wasnt what we had to book so i them had to stand back in the queue at reception and ask to move rooms, which they did for us... Having work on reception of a hotel i do not believe i recieved proper customer service at all, i dont think i heard a sorry for either members of staff for making us wait etc...
Everything else was very nice in the hotel, the rooms and breakfast.. Im not sure i would stay again, i have been put of slightly.",4,2009,09,28
115,A place to go back to,"My husband and I stayed two nights and we had no disappointment with this hotel which looked just like the pictures on its site. Extremely well located, quiet, luxurious. The bedroom was spacious with a big desk and a nice reading chair. I was very satisfied with two aspects that matter a lot to me: the lighting was very nice and warm, a dimmer was even connected to all the lights of the room; the bed and the pillows were very comfortable. I asked the second day for non allergenic pillows that were given to us very rapidly. All the rest goes without saying for a hotel of that range. We were just a bit surprised by some strong smell on our floor (the 3rd), maybe the new carpet?
The only glitch was with one of the concierges. We asked him the last day for a cab to Saint Pancras Train Station. It is literally a 10-minute ride and it cost us 10 pounds instead of 5 because the concierge had called a private car service (a friend, a cousin, who knows?). We only found this out when the cab arrived. The concierge told us at that time that he could not call black cabs that worked by the meter. He should at least have informed us from the beginning. It is the first time I see a hotel of that category not being able to offer its customers regular cabs! Of course, we were rushed by time to catch our train, so we had to pay the 10 pounds.",4,2009,09,19
115,Very Good hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights at the end of August & found this hotel to be of very high quality.  Arrived at lunch time on Saturday but the room wasn't ready (which is no problem as you would not expect it to be so early in the day).  The receptionist was all apologies & very nicely bumped us up to a suite!  We stayed as part of a package which included tickets for a show, however there was a bit of confusion over this with the concierge which ended up with us going to the theater & dealing with them directly.  The hotel had failed to book the tickets, however the theater rang the hotel & they sorted there & then immediately with no question of extra payment.

The suite when we got there was immaculate - large bed, what must have been a 47"" TV & a large sofa area for lounging.  The bathroom was also outstanding with a huge tub & separate walk in shower & toilet.  If going back I would definitely request an upgrade again & pay the difference to stay in room 312!

We had dinner in the restaurant 1 night which was not as good as it should have been.  The 3 waiters seemed a little lost at times & unsure of what they were doing.  1 in particular audibly tutted when we said we were only having 2 courses as part of the pre-theater dinner.  Attitudes like that can put people off returning very easily.  Food was good, and the following morning breakfast was good also with a huge selection.

The bar area is small but very nicely done.  The barman gives a huge welcome to everyone who walks in which is a nice touch & adds a good atmosphere to the place.  A good place to round an evening off in.

We were checking out early (5.30am) & asked the concierge the day before to book a taxi to Heathrow, unfortunatly when we got to reception the receptionist checked around & found none had been booked.  However he rang around several places & got one within 10 minutes (this was 5.45am on a bank holiday Monday so that's no mean feat!)

Overall a high quality hotel, just be sure to double check all transactions involving the concierge....",4,2009,09,08
115,"Bloomsbury Hotel - Superb, Stylish and Excellent Value for Money!","My husband and I stayed at The Bloomsbury Hotel on Friday 4th and Saturday 5th September, and I have to say this is one of the very best hotels that I have ever had the pleasure of staying in.  From walking through the front entrance you are greeted straight away with friendly hellos and enquiries about checking in.  We had a marvellous surprise waiting for us, as I had phoned ahead and said that if possible, as it was my husband's birthday, could we have a really nice standard room?  Well, when we checked in we were upgraded to a suite on the 7th floor, room 703, and I have to say it was gorgeous, red velvet chairs, a huge king size bed, with a gorgeous silk cream and red bedspread on it, walk in closet area, lovely marble bathroom with huge walk in shower and bath, spotlessly clean and tidy and all new.  We were thrilled with the room and the staff were all so friendly and professional as well.  We had breakfast in our room on both mornings, continental being included in the price, and it was brought up to us always promptly at the requested time; the food was lovely and fresh and plentiful and always with a rose in vase on the tray.

We had a drink in the hotel bar and were again treated with respect and friendliness.  I'm sorry, but I really cannot fault The Bloomsbury; its in an ideal spot, so close to all amenities, yet on a quiet street, yet you are five minutes from The British Museum and all other places are close by of interest.  Whilst in London, we ate at Mon Plaisir, a superb french restaurant and at The Boxwood Cafe for a late lunch, both excellent.  If we had been staying longer, then we would have definitely dined at the restaurant in the hotel.  I had a quick look in and it looked very modern and clean and new and I've heard that the food is very good.  We had room service on Satruday night and the food that was brought up was excellent.  All in all we were very impressed with this hotel and we are quite hard to please, but our weekend trip away started at The Bloomsbury Hotel and ended with excellent memories, thank you so much.  Michelle Ormrod.",5,2009,09,07
115,Blooming Lovely.,"Spent 3 nights at the Bloomsbury and very nice it was indeed.

The hotel is in a great location with the British museum only a couple of hundred yards along the same road, and only a 10-15 minute walk down to Leicester Square, Piccadilly and Covent Garden.

I stayed in a superior room which was nice and room by London standards.
Nice soft Queen bed and a flat screen tv.
There was a safe and hi-fi access if required.

The bathroom had both a bath and shower.

The staff were very friendly and helpful and when checking in i was offered a hot flannel, which is a lovely touch.

In the beautiful lobby there is a computer than gives free internet access to hotel customers.

My room was very quiet and always clean. 

Overall it was a very nice experience staying here which i would repeat again no problem.",5,2009,09,05
115,"Great Hotel,Great location!","Just returned from a long weekend at this fabulous hotel.This hotel is basically  a 2 minute walk from the British museum and Oxford street,5 minutes from soho and theatreland. The hotel is spotless,the staff friendly and cant do enough for you and the rom was quiet.We booked breakfast when we arrived as we got a great deal for room only.We paid £15 each per night for the full english and it was really nice but all the pubs and cafes in the area do breakfasts for a much cheaper £5 per head. Hope to go back soon.Would recommend to anyone.",5,2009,09,03
115,"Great location, nice hotel but small rooms","Just returned from a short stay in the Bloomsbury- overall a nice hotel, great location in central London, good value and friendly staff. The rooms are small however, and breakfast was expensive. All in al a good place to stay in central London.",4,2009,08,30
115,"brilliant , brilliant, brilliant","What a find! A fantastic hotel in central London at a mind numbing cheap price. We stayed here for two nights and will not be staying anywhere else when we go to London, which is frequently. The htel was beautifully decorated, the restaurant was delighful, the staff helpful ( i got a hot towel from reception upon arrival)the room was immaculate. Sky TV, expresso maker, breakfast in bed at no extra cost, the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in, i didn`t want to go home. 

The location, well, about 5 minutes walk from Oxford Circus. 

Book it on travel zoo and get bed and breakfast at a great rate.",5,2009,08,28
115,Good Hotel well located near to tube in quiet road.,Good Hotel well located near Tottenhan Court Road tube station so easy to get around. No Car parking and the car park opposite is £31 per day.,4,2009,08,22
115,At Great Stay at The Bloomsbury Hotel,"I booked the hotel based on reviews on this site and was very happy I did. This was a birthday surprise for my girlfriend, we went to a show and had a really nice meal out.

The staff were all very friendly and happy to help with any questions or advice.
Our room was very well decorated and extremely comfortable. Breakfast in the morning was very tasty and although we didn't pay for the full english the continental was more than enough.

The location of the hotel could not have been better for us, we walked everywhere and many of the top locations and sites are easily accessible by foot.

Overall a great stay and will defiantly return to this hotel.",5,2009,08,20
115,So Glad We Stayed Here,"Just returned from a four night stay and am so glad I chose this hotel after reading the reviews of it on TA.
Good location ,plenty of restaurants to choose from and only 5 min walk to the British Museum and 10 min to Covent Garden.
The hotel is newly refurbished very stylish, and comfortable, we had a room on the 5th floor at the front  that was a good size ,comfortable bed,nice  bathroom with a very good shower.
But what really makes this hotel special are the staff who without exception were polite,
helpful,and professional they were a real credit to the hotel.
We ate in the hotel one evening and although the restaurant lacks  atmosphere a little the food was excellent  and the service friendly and attentive.",5,2009,08,17
115,"Very good hotel overall, highly recommended","Stayed there for 3 nights, the hotel was newly renovated and both service and the rooms were excellent. Completely new. Its location was very very convenient too, within walking distance to oxford street, soho and convent garden.

The beds were soft and super comfortable too, the only complaint was that due to renovation works in the lobby, there was a fair bit of noise within the hotel, and even audiable from the rooms, but i guess it should be temporary and its limited to daytime only. 

Since I got a weekend 3N for 2N deal, it was a very good deal for its quality, on par with 5 star hotels.

Will return definitely!",4,2009,08,17
115,"Location, Plush at a bargain price","Very roomy, recently renovated hotel with very modern bathroom including sockets for USA, European, and Englih appliances -- and a lot of them at the desk.  Free Internet access and breakfast were included in my hotel charges.  The breakfast was a full English breakfast-- you could order anything hot as well as enjoy the buffet of cereals, pastries, multiple fruits and fruit juices and coffee, tea, or hot chocolate.  We saved a lot of not having to buy more than a snack for our lunch.   The hotel is less than five minutes from the Tottenham Court Road Underground station and bus stops and five minutes from the British museum.  There is an abundance of restaurants in the surrounding area.  Staff were friendly and helpful.    Hint:  if you are flying, book via the Internet with Easy Airport cars -- it cost only 35 pounds one way which sure beat wrestling with luggage if you went by train and the underground.  Public transportation is not as cheap as it used to be and if two or more people are travelling, it is worth the extra pounds to go by taxi when you have luggage.",5,2009,08,09
115,"Decent, clean, efficient and nicely decorated","Due to a business meeting at the end of our holiday we stayed in a The Bloomsbury and were reasonably impressed. The room although a little small and lacking the mini-bar that most have was beautifully decorated and comfortable. The free broadband worked well and allowed me to get things done quickly. The staff with one exception were polite, helpful and efficient. 
The hotel is a few hundred metres from Tottenham Court Road station and in walking distance to many places.
While we regrettably did not have time to go the restaurant we did have room service late one night. The food was freshly made and tasty so no complaints.

Overall a good hotel and at the price we paid pretty good value. Their rating will remain high provided they can continue this level of service without being ridiculous on price.",4,2009,08,05
115,The Best Hotel in London,"I dont normally write hotel reviews but the stanard of this hotel was excellent and warrants a review, from arrival and quick polite check in with hot towels to left luggage on departure everything was first class. The room was excellent with a queen bed and all facilities one could wish for , I cannot recommend it highly enough . To the management Thank you for making my wifes birthday treat to London so speial.",5,2009,08,04
115,Nice hotel- for the independent traveler (don't ask hotel for help),"We had a nice stay at the Bloomsbury. The hotel is situated in a nice location- close to bus and tube transportation and walking distance to most of London. The rooms were comfortable and small. Very little closet space and no dressers. Breakfast was included in our stay and it was great. My main concern/complaint was that the concierge staff and the front desk were not very helpful when it came to questions regarding London. They couldn't give us any recommendations for restaurants, no idea where the closest movie theater was located...etc. The head concierge was extremely helpful but he was the only exception. All and all a good hotel as long as you know what you want to see and do in London (and how to get there).",4,2009,07,31
115,"Great location; spacious, well decorated rooms",I stayed at this hotel for a week on business and loved it.   It's in a really nice location -- right near the British Museum.  The rooms have just been renovated and are very nicely appointed -- very modern and beautifully done.  The room I had was also huge.   Would definitely stay here again.,5,2009,07,28
115,Fab  4 star Hotel at reasonable price in Central London,"The Bloomsbury hotel is very central but situtated in a very quiet street, the hotel has been newly refurbished, on arrival at reception we were handed heated cloths to refresh our hands,""great after a long journey"" the staff are very good and extremely helpful, rooms are clean and comfortable, We sampled the food a few times and was impressed with the standard, it was tasty and portions were good, We booked the lazy weekend which allowed you a long lye in the morning and drinks to the value of £25.00 in the bar, ""great cocktail choice""
I would recommend this hotel and intend to return very soon.",4,2009,07,27
115,Great stay and location!,"Stayed here for 3 nights based on a travelzoo promotion and reviews.  However, when I logged onto the hotel website, I could not get the promotion.  We did not try the restaurant or bar so cannot comment.  One minor issue - it took 3 inquiries to finally get a bar of hand soap on our last night.  
Free internet connection (but no printer to print out boarding pass).  Location was good.  British Museum around the block from hotel.  Five min. walk to Tube stop Tottenham Court Road on Central/North line.  Buy the tube day pass for L5.60 and go all over.  There is a TKTS booth at Leicester Square for discount play tickets.  Don’t be fooled by all the booths when you exit the tube.  They are not the real TKTS booth and charge you more.  Take a one hour train ride to Windsor Castle.   Be prepared that all of the attractions are expensive but worth it.",4,2009,07,24
115,Good standard of hotel in handy location,"stayed here twice in July with work. The location could not be handier. Come out of Tottenham Court road tube and turn right past the Dominion Theatre
The hotel has had  a refurb since it was Jury's. It's now even nicer. Rooms are on the small side unless you upgrade but are bright, modern a touch of luxury even and have everything you need inc tea/coffee.
In July and August- they seem to be doing a B&B deal of £120pn which is super value for the location and the standard of the food. Staff are pleasant and helpful.
Will certainly use again.",4,2009,07,21
115,Nice room and ok size for London,"I stayed here before when it was Jurys and although the price has gone up a bit, it is all the better for its renovation. Really nicely styled room and an Ok size for London. Our room only had a shower and no bath but it was still good.

Location is excellent a few mins walk from Tottenham Court tube and eaily walkable to covent garden.

Reception staff were really efficient and it was a nice touch to welcome you withe hot towels.",4,2009,07,18
115,Keep returning to this lovely and central hotel,"I love this hotel and have stayed here three times. It's a perfect base for a weekend in London. 

It's recently been refurbished and the newly redecorated rooms are very modern, clean and comfortable. The rooms are small but great. The old character of the building also adds some charm to the lobby area.

The location is excellent- just off New Oxford Street, beside the tube, close to Soho and West End yet in a quiet street so you are not disturbed by noise.

It's great value for what you get and for the location and there are often good offers available.

I have not eaten here but have used the bar which is fine.

Keep returning to this central, comfortable hotel",5,2009,07,15
115,superb hotel great location,"great hotel - great location - rooms are not too small and are all newly furnished  this is by far the nicest hotel for the money we have stayed at in London would deffo stay again and recommend it highly
nice brekkie lots of choices - very polite staff
great hotel!!",5,2009,07,13
115,Our experience with the Bloomsbury Hotel,"We chose the Bloomsbury Hotel after reading the some good reviews on it.    Booked a week stay at deluxe room which we paid higher for the comfort with amenities like bath robes and slippers.    Here are our experience with hotel.  

The Good:

Hotel is nice being recently refurbished.  Friendly service at the restaurant, and concierge; especially Brian, the head concierge, who helped us with the tour & show tickets.  Food was pretty good at the restaurant and we visited twice since we were too tired to get out to explore on other restaurants for 2 nites.

Location is okay with Tottenham station around the corner but we did not particularly like the neighborhood near this station.

The Bad:

There are steps to get to the lobby which we did not really like; especially if you were struggling with your big baggages.   Of course, we could leave the bags on the street and go into the lobby to request concierge to pick them up but there must be someone watching the baggages while another go get the concierge.

Front desk was ok but lack of smiles.   We had a little disappointment during check in with the front desk guy.   When we make comments about the room that reserved for us too close to the elevator (we requested a room away from elevator) and wanted to take a look at the room.  He abruptly snatched back our reservation form showing an attitude problem.   It was bad to have guests forming a first bad impression right at the beginning.   

Hotel seems to be a little under staff maybe due to the current economic situation.  Concierge is very helpful but sometimes, they are not available because only one was on duty.   We were told that there was no housekeeping available until after 9.00 am when we were running out of coffee and sugar in the morning.  Operator did not volunteer to help unless you asked.

Two days in a row, false fire alarm went off 4 times in early morning.  One time in one day and 3 times in another within 1 hr.  We called to check and was told they were trying to fix it.  No morning call necessary for that morning.  A good insurance not to oversleep.

Room has free internet connection but was not wireless.  Refrigerator is locked with beverages and have no space for your own beverages.
Basin was leaking and we need to place a towel underneath it.  
Not sure if it was fixed but the towel was placed there till we left.

There are many other hotels in the neighborhood to check out if you want to live in this area.  It was ok to stay here if you want a newly refurbished facility.",3,2009,07,13
115,Just Perfect!,"I booked a Friday night out in London as a treat for me and my girlfriend and choose this hotel to stay over for the night,I read lots of the reviews on here and decided to try it out,I'm so glad I did because we both had a lovely stay after a long day and a night out.The hotel is fantastic both inside and out and the staff were all very polite and helpful with our needs,it's also in a perfect location for all the sights/bars/restaurants around the West End,a couple of minutes walk and your right in the mix! The rooms are superb with large LCD TV's and a nice bathroom too,last but not least I'd like to mention the beds,they are so comfortable! we had a king size bed and both slept really well,I would definitely stay here again.",5,2009,07,12
115,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for 1 night in June 2009. The hotel was wonderful. Good service, vey modern and clean and bright. Our room was smaller than rooms we've had in other hotels, but was stil an OK size. Location wise is excellent for getting to Covent Garden and the theatres.  We didn't eat at the hotel as we stayed on a room only babsis so I can't comment on the food, but there is a great little cafe just across the road which did lovely lunches and breakfast.",4,2009,07,12
115,Fantastic!,"Beautiful hotel in a great location, perfect as a base for exploring London and at a reasonable price - what more do you ask for! We stayed for three nights last week and were very impressed by the cleanliness, decor and furnishings in the hotel.  We had a packed schedule upon arrival in London, so much to see and do (including a day at the Tennis Championships in Wimbledon!).  We ate in the restaurant twice.  On both occasions the restaurant staff were extremely welcoming and friendly and the food was gorgeous!  Compliments to the chef!  We had a few drinks in the bar each night, the staff are very friendly and attentive.  The Bar Manager, Pritan, in particular went out of his way to please us and also made us some super cocktails!  Overall our experience in this hotel was fantastic! We look forward to our return in the near future!",5,2009,07,06
115,Lots of minor issues left a bad taste,"Broadly speaking, there is plenty to like about this hotel - good sized; well stocked rooms and a great position for theatreland & Oxford Street etc. My booking was for 2 rooms - my wife & I and my brother and his wife.

We booked through Expedia paying £268 for the two rooms. As it was a busy Saturday night our rooms where 2 floors apart; but no huge issue there. My brother's room however was clearly a disabled room as it had no bath and was most obviously laid out for wheelchair access. Arriving back at the hotel; the power to the room was lost which took reception around 20 minutes to solve (at midnight - inconvenient but not awful). In the morning the power was again lost 2 further times and fixed relatively quickly. They were offered a room change, but seeing as we were checking out in an hour or two; it didn't really seem worthwhile. No offer of a refund or part-refund was offered either.

Around a week later, I received a bill in the post showing my card had been charged £103.50 for my room which took 2 or 3 phone calls to eventually sort out and get refunded. If I hadn't noticed this on my statement; I'm sure it wouldn't have been detected as charged incorrectly by the Hotel either.

It also shows that the hotel's room rate of £90 +VAT is far less than the £134 we paid through Expedia for each room.

One final point - the cost of breakfast is a complete rip off at £21. Having read some reviews on here before leaving I saw that someone was unaware of this cost when assuming that breakfast was included. The same thing would have happened to us as when checking in the front of house staff told us when breakfast was served, but not that we had to pay for it. I asked if it was included and was told it wasn't.

So - hotel is good if your stay has no troubles. Just be sure to check you haven't been double charged, make sure you haven't been given a disabled access room & don't bother with their breakfasts. We found a great Turkish place nearby with Mediterranean breakfasts for around £5.",3,2009,07,06
115,"Great hotel, very friendly and helpful staff - I will definately visit again!","We arrived at midday as we had a theatre trip arranged.  We left our bags with the consierge whilst we went and had lunch in the bar.  The food was exceptional and the steak bagette melted in your mouth.
When we got our rooms we had one with a bath and one with a walk in shower -so I would recommend anyone that has a preference to mention this at the time of booking or check-in!  Both rooms were newly decorated, clean and of a reasonable size.  The bathrooms too were a good size.  We didn't have dinner at the hotel but wished we had as the meal we had out was terrible and ended up coming back and having dessert and coffee back at the hotel - again the food was very good!
The beds were very comfortable.
We found the staff very helpful and friendly and they couldn't do enough for us.
We visit London a couple of times a year and we will definately stay at this hotel from now on and we have stayed at some of the best! 
Overall - great location and great staff!!",5,2009,07,05
115,Very Pleasant stay,"Stayed here for a long weekend in London. The hotel was very clean and very modern, we stayed in a junior suite which was just perfect with a fantastic bathroom filled with plenty of bits and bobs that you always need when away from home. The staff were of excellent service and very helpful at all times. The only little grumble I have is that room service was quite slow having to wait 45 minutes even if you ordered at 3 in the morning, and not great food that was sent to us.  But overall an excellent hotel and we will certainly be going back.",5,2009,06,29
115,Perfect!,"Stayed for one night last weekend as part of a theatre package for my birthday. When we went to check in we were originally told that they couldn't check us in for another half an hour, 45 minutes because they were waiting on a linen delivery!? But the lady on the front desk was very very efficient in sorting us a room out quickly and we actually only waited about 5 minutes. She was very professional the entire time. Room was stunning. This hotel has recently gone under refurbishment so the rooms really feel as though they are brand new! Very clean, very pretty etc. 
Location is excellent, right around the corner from the British Museum and minutes away from covent garden/Leicester square and so on. We actually got cabs everywhere seeing as it was a 'special occasion'  and the cost was significantly under ten pounds each time. 
Our package deal included breakfast but when we went downstairs the next morning we were told continental breakfast included when my booking confirmation said english. However, I didn't say anything because the continental breakfast was excellent! Great selection of near on everything you could include in a description of a continental breakfast and staff were very attentive, although it was quite busy at the time we went down for breakfast they never looked rushed and came over to ask us how everything was and to offer us more toast - they certainly don't scrimp like some hotels do. A couple next to us were having the full english and it did look good too. 
Would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone. Obviously the price is quite steep but I would happily say it was worth the money.",5,2009,06,24
115,"Wonderful hotel, great staff. I won't stay anywhere else in London.","This was my 4th stay within a year at this beautiful, centrally located hotel.
Renovated since my last 2008 visit, the rooms are immaculate and beautifully appointed.
The staff in every department take great pride in their jobs and made me feel most welcome.
I would recommend this hotel on the basis that it's absolutely perfect as a base for exploring London, excellent for business travellers and terrific value for the money.",5,2009,06,18
115,"Absolutely fantastic, our London base for every vist!","We just stayed at the Bloomsbury on Sunday night. The hotel is immaculate with a lovely reception area. The staff were very friendly and helped with everything! We were also allowed to check in early as our room was ready, meaning we didn't have to carry around all our clothes etc. Our room was 608 and was a good size, large entrance with a ""to die for bed and bathroom"". The decoration was fantastic. Everything was clean and looked brand new. We had a large flat screen TV with Sky Sports and DTV, tea & coffee making stuff, magazines, hairdrier, ironing board & iron. We couldn't have asked for more! We will now be staying here each time we visit London as we know our money will be well spent. We had full breakfast which was gorgeous, I had Smoked Haddock & Scrambled and my boyfriend had a Full English. You could also help yourself to juice, cereal, fruit, meats and cheeses! We were stuffed and set up well for a days shopping!

We actually came back to the hotel on Monday for lunch, which again was lovely and quickly prepared.

Definately recommend this hotel time and time again a the location is perfect for any London trip and the hotel itself is FAULTLESS.

Well done Bloomsbury!!!",5,2009,06,16
115,Excellent choice,"Stayed at the Bloomsbury for 1 night and would thoroughly recommend it. Greeted by very friendly receptionists who checked us in promptly, offering us refreshing warm towels whilst they did so. The room was very nice with a very comfortable bed. One thing I was aware of later at night was how quiet it was, no banging of doors or loud televisions from next door ( a welcome change !). The public areas are very spacious and the whole hotel seemed very clean.  I would definitely reccomend this hotel.",5,2009,06,14
115,great hotel,Stayed at this hotel for four nights and it did not disappoint. At reception we were greeted by the very friendly and helpful Casha. She made us feel so welcome. Our bedroom was average in size but very clean and tastefully decorated. The beds are really comfy and the room was very quiet at night. The bar staff were also very efficient and friendly. as was the concierge. The location of this hotel is so central with the underground just  a two minute walk  from the hotel and all the shops of Oxford street a five minute walk away.  Overall a great  hotel in a great location with very helpful staff,5,2009,06,13
115,Good Hotel and location,"We stayed for one night here on 6th June.  We found the location of the hotel really easy, right at Tottenham Court Road tube station.  Check-in was quick and efficient, and although our room was not ready (we arrived about 11) our bags were stored for us.  We stayed in a superior room which was lovely, and the bed was sooo comfy I wanted to take it home with me!!  We had continental breakfast included in our rate which was a great start to the day.

I found the staff very friendly and helpfull, especially in the bar!  They didn't let us wait for our drinks at the bar, instead brought them to us!

All in all a very enjoyable stay and I would definitely stay again!",5,2009,06,08
115,Good Hotel and Good Location but Beware,"This hotel is in an ideal location in a happening part of London and I would have to compliment the reception staff in the hotel as I found them very helpful, friendly and professional throughout. 
However we did have a most unpleasant experience in the breakfast room on the first morning of our stay. We had mistakenly believed that breakfast was included on our room rate (We had paid €280 for our 2 night stay). My girlfriend and I proceeded to the self service breakfast selection and selected a few pieces of fruit and resumed our seats. Within seconds the restaurant manager asked us what our room number was. After giving it to him he checked it out and informed us that breakfast was not included with that room rate. I was a little surprised but nonetheless apologised and asked him to charge it to the room subject to me asking for the price. He then informed us in a dismissive manner that it would be £21.50 each for a full breakfast. We told him that the price was a little excessive and that we would get breakfast elsewhere. As we got up to leave he informed me that he would have to charge us for the few pieces of fruit that we had already consumed coming up with a random figure of £7. I felt totally humilated and embarrassed by the whole incicident especially as this was taking place in full view of a semi full breakfast room. I really thought it mean spirited to charge me for eating a few pieces of fruit that had been eated in error. It really left a bitter taste in my mouth and I for one will not be hurry back to this hotel and I will advise friends and colleagues accordingly.",3,2009,06,03
115,Excellent,"Great hotel. Clean, modern, spacious with great service.
Worth getting the breakfast included price.
Convenient to Tube - 2 mins walk
Overall excellent - would recomend and would certainly stay again",5,2009,05,31
115,Oh dear - Something just missing from this hotel,"Stayed there for 2 nights.  It isn't the same as Jury's used to be.  Yes the hotel is pretty and well located and the new room decor is good but there is just something wrong with the service here. 

Few things:

1.  On check in I had to ask about the £25 credit for food and drink that I received with the package I bought - that should have been pointed out to me I felt 

2  No TV remote control in the room - this should have been checked as part of the room servicing.  In fairness they sent one up within 15 mins

3,  The safe didn't work - that couldn't be corrected until the next morning

4.  The handle of the door was broken and came off in my hand - much panic as I tried to get the handle back on again so I could get the door opened.  I reported this but it wasn't fixed over the weekend and we had to be careful it didn't come off again.

5.  Breakfast was average for this sort of hotel.  On the second morning we came down late (but before breakfast ended) and were not offered a cooked breakfast - neithe rof us was particulalry hungry so we didn't push it but it seems strange that the staff may have been trying to avoid any more cooking.

6.  On check out, we were charged for room service food.  Fair enough but the famous £25 food credit was not deducted from the bill - again I had to ask for the credit to be applied.  There was no apology for this attempt to overcharge.

All in all this hotel has a great location and nice decor but it is missing a service quality that you would expect for the price.  Staff are polite and friendly but are just not with it in terms of service focus.

Disappointing as I liked to stay in these hotels under their own names.  I think I will look at the more consistent brands like Marriott in the future.",3,2009,05,24
115,Did not disappoint,"It is very difficult to choose a hotel without prior recommendation. I am so glad that we chose this hotel. I found the room and decor most pleasing.  The service in the bar and restaurant was excellent, the staff were so welcoming and attentive. From the moment we arrived to book in the delight of the refreshing flannel in reception the room and the meal in the restuarant, it made our stay in London very enjoyable. The Lazy stay deal is so worth while I recommend it to all. Thank you, we will certainly return and recommend this hotel to others.",5,2009,05,24
115,Excellent hotel,"We have just returned from an overnight stay at the Bloomsbury. We found an offer on line which gave us a late checkout (2pm) and breakfast included for a very good price. We found the hotel very easy to get to and just a few minutes walk from the British Museum. The rooms weren't quite ready but the staff were very friendly and took our bags while we wandered off for a bit of sightseeing. We returned 45 mins later and were given the key to our room and told our bags would follow. After an initla hiccup getting to the room we walked in and were very impressed. The room was a standard double room and was small but beuatifully decorated. Very clean with all the facilities needed. There was a nice big flatscreen TV - with speakers in the bathroom so you need not miss anything! The bed was one of the comfiest hotel beds I've ever stayed in and the shower was lovely to. 

We had booked a set 3 course dinner as we had tickets for the Albert Hall so wanted to eat first. The meal was excellent and the service from the staff was also excellent. We didn't feel rushed at all and they were constantly around to see to our every need. The morning breakfast was also very good with a continetal style buffet option as well as a full English ordered from the kitchen. The presentation and choice was great.

Checkout was easy and very quick. All in all an excellent stay and worth every penny. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone want to sight see around London. It is central but also quiet.",5,2009,05,23
115,Good location - facilities disappointing,"Starting with the positive - the location was very central. We stayed three nights and walked everywhere we went - the Globe Theatre, Covent Garden, Prince of Wales Theatre, Millennium Bridge, Westminster ...
Foyer and Reception areas were spacious. We didn't eat there so can't comment on the restaurant or breakfast facilities.
Our room was on the 7th floor so we took the lift. A couple of times we had to physically push the door the last couple of centimetres to get it to close so that the lift would move. We always arrived safely but it was a rather creaky journey.
The room itself was small but ok for our needs. One small window, looking out onto a dingy area between rooms. Other reviewers have commented on the lack of space for clothes - one rail with 4 hangers and a narrow shelf in the wardrobe. Again, for 3 nights it was ok - I would think it would be difficult if you were staying a week or more.
The room had a good sized flat-screen TV, a mini-bar style fridge which couldn't be used for storing your own bottled water etc. and tea and coffee making facilities. There was a selection of teabags (but only 2 of each variety, so once I had made a pot of tea on arrival I had used up all the ""standard"" teabags), coffee, 2 small cartons of UHT milk (again, used for the initial drink), 2 small cartons of UHT cream and a pack of Shortbread Fingers. I expect Housekeeping would have brought more if I had rung them, but initial supplies did seem a little sparse.
Our main problem was with the shower. The bathroom was smartly decorated with a good sized shower, hand basin and toilet. The shower was of the ""wet room"" style, with a central drain but no shower tray as such. ""Wet room"" was a very apt description, as whenever we used the shower, the entire bathroom floor got very wet indeed. After the first time, we had to paddle through about 2cm of water to get to the bathroom door or to get to the loo! We spent some time mopping this up with towels and the next time we used the shower, took the precaution of rolling up the bath mat and wedging it at the foot of the fixed glass partition. This reduced the quantity of excess water sloshing around the room, although we still needed to mop up. Eventually we decided just to have showers in the morning, turning the water off as quickly as possible and hope that Room Service could deal with the aftermath. The water did eventually drain away but it was a very slow process. 
As we didn't pay the full price for our room, I presume we were given one of the poorer rooms in the hotel and I felt the facilities were adequate. Had I paid the full rate or been staying longer, I would have complained about the shower and asked to move.
I would consider staying there again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.",3,2009,05,21
115,Highly recommended,"A very nice hotel in the perfect location for business or pleasure in London. Elegant decor in rooms and public spaces. A warm welcome at reception with refreshing towels. 
Very comfortable  and well equiped bedroom, I had a wonderful nights sleep. Breakfast was good: wide variety but service a little slow. I will certainly stay here again on my next visit to London.",5,2009,05,16
115,Superb Hotel,"Booked the Bloomsbury via Travelzoo and got a great deal, £105 inc vat, B&B and a 15% discount in the restaurant (not that i had dinner in there). Booked the hotel due to this deal and its location, Tottenham Court Road tube is just around the corner and only 15 mins from Victoria where we went to the theatre. The Lutyens designed hotel looks lovely from the outside and doesnt dissapoint on the inside. We were greeted at reception with a hot flannel, which was most welcome after negotiating the tubes, the friendly receptionist checked us in with minimal fuss and off we went to our room.
The hotel has recently been refurbished by the new owners and our room was nicely decorated and had a large flat screen tv and the heated bathroom floor was a nice touch too.
The room did feel a little small which was probably due to it being an end room and the view out of the window was of a wall, which wasnt great - felt like there were probably nicer rooms in the hotel but certainly wouldnt complain, it was nice enough and got a great deal anyway so wasnt too bothered by the size or lack of view.
Bed was comfy although the misses siggested it was a little too soft for her.
Breakfast was super with buffet cereals, fruits and pastries and plated hot food also available - Id recommend the kippers, they were lovely.
Check out was at 12 which was nice as didnt have to rush out/
Overall a great hotel in a great location, id definately recommend.",4,2009,05,09
115,So Glad We Chose This Hotel,"Before booking this hotel i had read a few mixed reviews here on Trip Advisor. I decided that i would give it a go anyway as some people really rated the hotel.
Upon arriving too early to check in, the concierge was more than happy to store our luggage so we could explore for a little while before checking in. The hotel is well placed for the tube Tottenham Court Road which is literally two minutes walk around the corner. However if you prefer to walk, Covent Garden, Soho, Oxford Street, Trafalgar Square and all the attractions are within short walks.
When returning to check in to the hotel it quick and easy.
The hotel its self has recently undergone a big refurbishment and was stunning, the reception/lobby area was very grand. We booked a Deluxe Double with a Queen Bed and were very impressed with the room. The room was very modern, with a huge widescreen TV at the bottom of the bed, walk in wardrobe, and modern bathroom which even had a flat screen in the bath! Simply Gorgeous!
One the last night of our stay we used the hotels room service facility, and it was lovely food and good value for money. 
This was my first time in London and I will definitely be returning to this hotel. Loved London but thought this hotel made our weekend.
Anyone reading the bad reviews on this hotel saying about noise from construction i can confirm on my stay i heard nothing and the hotel was very peaceful.
Well worth a stay!",5,2009,05,05

115,Fantastic stay at One of the Best located Hotels in London,"We enjoyed a weekend at the Bloomsbury Hotel, its a very nice hotel that has only just been renovated. Who ever thought it out thought of everything even down to being able to plug your laptop into the large flat screen in the room... Beautiful rooms, which are very large by London standards, a swanky coffee maker and some nice furnishings...  Overall the Staff were very helpful and the hotel was within minutes walk of the west end for easy access to the theatre and some pretty good bars and restaurants...  I have stayed at a few hotels in London - including some of the big names - but to be honest next time im going straight for the Bloomsbury - be mad not to...",5,2009,04,24
115,"FINE HOTEL, UNTIL THE BILL","The hotel was one we had wanted to stay at for some time and finally got the opportunity.  Though small in size and with a rather small window the room was wonderfully appointed.  The hotel, one block from Tottenham Court Station could not be better located.  However, when we paid the bill there was a telephone charge for 27 British Pounds.  We had made ONE call to a relative's cellular phone and that was the source of the charge.  That it was a cellular phone came as a surprise.  As did the 2.5 Pound / minute charge.  The amount to be charged was not listed or bear the room's phone.  Instead it was part of the small print inside a policy book in the night-table drawer.  We have written to the hotel's management but, as yet, have received no reply.  If you stay at this hotel and do not have your own cellular, take care.",4,2009,04,22
115,Mixed feelings.,"First, the good:
The location is great. Quiet yet central - easy walking to most things, easy access to public transit for the rest. Also handy to many restaurants, theatres, and shopping.
The rooms have recently been refurbished and are very lovely. Nice bathrooms, comfortable beds, and fairly spacious.
The price is not bad if you can get one of the deals. 
Public spaces are very pleasant and have a quiet personality.  There is also a good room service menu available I think around the clock, which is nice.  The free wi-fi access is also much appreciated.
Now onto the not-so-good:
The rooms have some real practicality issues. For example, there is insufficient space for clothing for two people; the fridge is vending-machine style and cannot be used; the air conditioning system was terribly noisy; and while the shampoo and bath gel provided are lovely, it seems strange to leave out lotion, which is more practical than bath gel.
The real issue, though, was the little things.  For example, on check-in (to our deluxe room), we were asked which paper we'd like in the morning.  On check-out, it turned out that we were charged for the paper.  We were gld to have had the paper, but this approach is bad in principle and will irk many people out of returning.  Also, one of the reasons we'd chosen the dexlue room was for the nespresso cofee.  On arrival, however, while the coffee machine was indeed there, they did not have the coffee, and simply handed us packets of instant coffee to make wiht a kettle.  Another little thing that is bad for inspiring repeat business.  Similarly, the desk staff were very friendly but very, very inefficient.  They were unable to answer fairly basic questions, and unable to find fairly basic information even after ten minutes on the internet.  We eventually had to use our international cel phones to phone a local grocery store, for example, to enquire as to their hours. again, a little thing, but in this business, it's the little things that count.
It is a fine hotel, and I would likely recommend it to friends who didn't travel much. But for me - there are better.",3,2009,04,17
115,Perfect Location to be in the heart of the action!,"Booked this hotel for a theatre break with my mother.  The location was fantastic, you could pretty much walk to Convent Garden, Leicester Square, Oxford St. etc within a few mins.  It is an especially good location for those who are going to the theatre.  We saw Jersey Boys - which was awesome! (again walking distance)
The hotel were very efficient and very friendly - no complaints.  The room was very small but perfectly formed - the location offset that by a million miles. What do you want for a 3 night break?   The continental breakfast was delicious and the choice was more than substantial  I would highly recommend this hotel for a weekend break - I would certainly return again.",5,2009,04,16
115,Great location for city break to London,"We stayed in this hotel over Easter and had a great time. We got a great offer of 3 nights for the price of 2 and was well worth it. The room was small enough but that is to be expected in central London. However, they had been recently redecorated to a high standard - even had underfloor heating in the bathroom! 

Location wise, it was great- central to everything- we walked to Covent Garden, Leister Square, Picadilly, Oxford Street etc. We didn't avail of breakfast as it was £15 per person, but there was a lovely little cafe just beside the place where a nice english breakfast was £5.00. We were beside the Dominion Theatre and saw We will Rock You musical, but there's loads of other theatres near by.
I would recommend the hotel, but don't expect the staff to be overly friendly- but thats sometimes the norm in the big cities..though the bar man was really nice and friendly and a dab hand at the auld speciality cocktails!!",4,2009,04,15
115,"Nice hotel, disappointing room","I stayed in this hotel during a short visit to London.
The Hotel is very elegant, the location is great, very close to Tottenham Court Road.
The room (706) had all the amenities, even free Internet but:
it was very tiny, the only window opened to a closed space and the flow of water in the shower was very weak.
I'm not sure that this room represents the hotel but if they sell it, it their responsibilty.",3,2009,04,14
115,Holiday Top!,"We stayed for the second time at this property. The location of the Hotel is excellent, very close to Oxford Street and the underground line (Tottehham Court Road stop). Room equipped with all amenities, clean and well furnished. Service taken care of by true 5 stars, with evening review. Breakfast varied and plentiful, especially with the possibility of choices GLUTEN FREE, since in the family we have two celiacs. Inside the Hotel there is a bar where you can enjoy cocktails / aperitifs and quick dishes. We dined very well in the hotel restaurant (Gregory welcomed us with great professionalism). All the staff is very helpful, prepared and very kind, from all receptionists (special note for Suhaina), to receptionists Carmine and Mihai. Special thanks to Marta De Santis, prepared, very professional and welcoming, who was able to meet our every request, also given the problem of celiac disease, making us feel at home.

The very friendly staff help with this - especially the two good souls Maria and Estelita. It is great how the two unobtrusively and very personable shape the breakfast experience with served breakfast for hot dishes and a very good buffet with a wide selection. 

In the evening, the Coral Room with its bar and exceptionally designed cocktail menu offers the ideal excuse to end the day in style and comfort. Here too, professional staff who love their job of providing good service. The Bloomsbury is warm and authentic.",5,2023,11,17

Nos atendió el señor Ortiz creo que de nombre  Emanuel. Llegamos por viaje de novios para celebrar año nuevo, después de que nos subieran las maletas a la habitación y dar una vuelta por el centro al llegar a la habitación. OMG una botella de champang y unos pétalos decorando la cama con forma de corazón.  He estado en hoteles de alto standing pero esta predisposición  es de aplauso.  Ya para finalizar y no de menos el desayuno espectacular así como la zona de cóctel y bar que tienen.  Hasta las botellas de agua las tienen puesta justo mostrando la marca, recta, todo en su sitio. Más que sorprendido y pocas veces doy un 10 por ser alguien con un nivel de exigencia bastante alto pero lo de este hotel y su Staff sobrepasa la excelencia.

Hier wird man von sehr gut geschultem Personal herzlich begrüßt und wirklich oft mit Namen angesprochen, gerade auch im Frühstücksbereich. Afternoon Tea wird im Coral Room serviert in dem sich auch eine große Bar befindet. 

Feine Cocktailbar im Untergeschoß und Musikclub, klasse live Musik mit ausserordentlich motiviertem Barkeepern, die ihr Handwerk verstehen und kleine Musikgruppen handverlesen ausgesucht werden. Bei tollen Cocktails findet man schnell den Draht zur Live Musik nicht als störendes Gedudel im Hintergrund, sondern als Ohrenschmaus - da  möchte man gar nicht mehr ins große komfortable Bett mit übergroßen Kopfkissen, die sich bequem anpassen lassen.

115,Klasse.,"Bin beim Londoner Zwischenstopp für zwei Nächte im The Bloomsbury eingekehrt.
War eine sehr gute Entscheidung. 
Habe ein exzellentes Team erlebt, fand das Ambiente cool aber nicht kalt, das Bett fantastisch und die Lage ideal zum einfach Loslaufen. 
Das Frühstück wird mit Buffet und einer feinen Auswahl an à la carte-Gerichten aufgetischt. Klar gibts Eggs Benedict. Und Eggs Florentine. Und Eggs Royale. Trotzdem mein Favorit: das getoastete Sauerteigbrot mit Avocado, Feta und gegrillten Cherry-Tomatoes.
Wer das vortreffliche Breakfast nicht mitgebucht hat und jetzt über den Preis quengeln will, wird nie verstehen, warum solch´ ein Start unbezahlbar ist: Man wird in den Tag geschmeichelt, mit Tipps versorgt (wenn man sich danach erkundigt) oder einfach in Ruhe gelassen. Anstatt ungefragt Hipster-Geschichten über die Herkunft lokaler Lebensmittel zu servieren (die Vollprofis erlebt man in Berlin), wird man hier lieber umsorgt – aufmerksam, flink und stets mit einer natürlichen Freundlichkeit. 
Für all das: Danke @The Bloomsbury team - you made my London days.

No contenta con el coctel que me recomendó la “adivina” del bar (sí.. este hotel lo tiene todo), un chico español que se llamaba Ema me recomendó una bebida que me encanto! Fue muy atento y nos recomendó una lugar para salir por la noche brutal.  
 
En definitiva, si estáis buscando donde quedaros para pasar el fin de semana en Londres, este es vuestro hotel!",5,2019,12,17
115,Fantastico!!!!,"uno dei migliori alberghi che tu possa trovare nella capitale ingles!

115,Hotel mit Charme,"Ich war hier für ein Wochenende mit meiner Frau.
Das Hotel ist super gelegen. Man fährt vom Flughafen einfach mit der Piccadelly Line zum Leicestersqaure und steigt dann um in die Northern zum Tottenham Court von dort sind es 2 Minuten Fussweg zum Hotel.
Der Empfang war sehr freundlich. Das Zimmer war etwas klein, für London aber okay.
Generell war alles sauber und gepflegt. Der Coral Room ist auf jeden Fall einen Besuch wert. 
Wir kommen gerne wieder",5,2019,08,28

La localización es ideal.
Lo recomiendo",5,2019,04,12
115,best choice,Habe meinen Geburtstag (8. Märzat jeden - internationaler Frauentag) in London gefeiert und wollte das passende Ambiente. Die Geschichte des Hotels passte so unfassbar gut zum Anlass. Der Jazzclub war für mich das i-Tüpfelchen für einen rundum fantastischen Aufenthalt. Danke für die tolle Zeit!,5,2019,03,17

115,Hotel excepcional,Hemos pasado dos días visitando Londres y nos recomendaron este Hotel. Está perfectamente ubicado en el centro de Londres y al lado de las principales calles. El servicio y la calidad de la atención ha sido excepcional y las instalaciones son inmejorables. Sin duda alguna recomendaríamos el Hotel 100%.,5,2018,11,22

Todo el personal es muy amable y nos han tratado de maravilla.
Muy recomendable",5,2018,11,04
115,Love this place!,Recomiendo mucho este lugar. La gente es super amable y se siente uno tranquilo. Si andas conociendo Londres este un lugar que te vas sentir agusto para descansar y seguir conociendo este pais Lindo. Super!,5,2018,10,23
115,Parece que entras en la novela del Gran Gatsby,"Es mi segunda estadía en este hotel maravilloso. Desde mi visita anterior cambiaron el interiorismo dándole un estilo años 20, sobre todo en el fabuloso bar y en las salas de estar, que es sumamente bello. 
La nota negativa es que el desayuno disminuyo en variedad y cantidad respecto de mi estadía anterior. Demasiado caro. 
Los artículos de toillette son de muy buena calidad así como las sabanas y las toallas.",5,2018,10,02
115,EXCELENTE HOTEL!!,"Un hotel súper recomendable. Hay que destacar la excelente atención de todo el personal q se esmera para q los huéspedes tengan la mejor estadía.
Excelentemente ubicado; cerca del Museo Británico; de la av. Oxford; de Coven Garden, etc.
Las habitaciones muy completas y con un exquisito mobiliario, al igual q el restaurante y cafeterías.
Destaco a Emmanuel, a Jero y Ricardo q hablan español.
A cuadra y media metro q viene del aeropuerto.
Súper recomendable The Bloomsbury!",5,2018,09,04
115,E' molto cambiato,"Torno al The Bloomsbury per il mio sesto soggiorno ( tutti precedenti la ristrutturazione ) e l’ ho trovato molto diverso da come lo ricordavo. Era un hotel classico, molto accogliente e soprattutto tranquillo pur essendo in una zona vivace della città.
Adesso è cambiato tutto, l’ ingresso ha ceduto il posto ad un moderno e rumorosissimo bar che da mattina a sera trasmette musica e, a contorno di tutto ciò, ai lati dell’ entrata dell’ hotel c'è  un bel ristorante con annessa musica dalla mattina alla sera. Le parti comuni sono sparite a parte un piccolo salotto con un camino carinissimo ma è difficile poter leggere un giornale o chiacchierare perché la musica del bar di fronte è perenne.
All’ arrivo mi è stata assegnata una delle peggiori camere che abbia mai visto nella mia ( lunga ) carriera da agente di viaggio, minuscola, angusta e priva di luce naturale. Il rumore delle macchine di condizionamento dell’ edificio hanno reso impossibile dormire. Tutto questo con una tariffa da oltre 300€ a notte.
Il giorno dopo ho potuto cambiare camera con un’ altra ( stessa categoria )  normale nella dimensione e con affaccio su Great Russell Street, tutti gli affacci sugli altri lati sono rumorosi anche per le tantissime macchine esterne dei condizionatori. 
Le camere hanno mantenuto un arredamento classico che era molto piacevole.
Il personale è gentilissimo e disponibile a risolvere qualunque problema con sollecitudine, la colazione è ancora molto buona anche se l’ assortimento non è vastissimo. Buonissime le uova alla  Benenedict,  Maria coordina la sala con bravura e professionalità.
Nella prima camera il frigobar era fornito ma con l' apertura bloccata, idem nella seconda camera e nonostante avessimo lasciato la carta di credito all' arrivo.
In conclusione non ho gradito come vengono trattati i clienti che arrivano con una prenotazione fatta da un’ agenzia di viaggio e per questo motivo non lo proporrò più ai clienti come ho fatto fino ad oggi.",3,2018,08,30
115,sehr schönes Hotel in bester Lage,"Das Bloomsbury können wir jedem empfehlen, der in einem luxeriösen Hotel verweilen möchte. Die Lage ist top!! Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Wir werde das Hotel auch beim nächsten London Trip buchen.",5,2018,08,30
115,Cumpleaños de mi mujer,"visitamos Londres mayo 2017 y tuvimos la suerte de poder hospedarnos en este maravilloso hotel . Una experiencia unica con un servicio y detalle al cliente que lo hace exclusivo.El personal fantastico , la atencion al cliente de lo mejor . Volvere sin dudarlo a este maravillo hotel",5,2018,07,06
115,Perfekt für einen kurzen Aufenthalt in London,"Das Bloomsbury kann ich jeden empfehlen, der in einem Viertel mit Kultur verweilen möchte. Wenige Fußminuten führen zum Britischen Museum und der Bahnhof Tottenham ist auch nicht weit entfernt. Von hier aus kann man noch weitere Stattviertel problemlos erreichen. Das Hotel an sich übezeugt durch seine moderne und trotzdem nicht zu kühle Einrichtung. Die Betten sind sehr bequem und die Bar lädt am Abend noch zu einem Absacker sein.",5,2018,06,12
115,Hotel para recomendar,"Un hotel muy comodo por ubicación cercana a los comercios, con muy buenas instalaciones y calidad de servicio, recomendado ! Habitaciones comodas, buen desayuno y toda la elegancia londinense presente.",4,2018,05,07
115,Sehr schönes Stadthotel in prima Lage mit besonderem Flair,"Haben dieses Hotel anlässlich eines Business Events gebucht. Die sehr gute Lage, Nähe Covent Garden, China Town, British Museum etc. würde sich bei einem Privataufenthalt sicherlich bestens bezahlt machen. Auch so konnte ich dieses saubere und angenehme Hotel mit einem besonderen Flair genießen. Hervorhebenswert sind die tolle Bar, die schöne Einrichtung, z.B. Lesezimmer und der überaus zuvorkommende Service (Empfang, Frühstücksteam/Dimitar!, Barpersonal). Die Zimmer sind etwas klein, aber für ein Cityhotel sicher ausreichend, mit allem was benötigt wird (inkl. Badewanne und kleinen Aufmerksamkeiten) ausgestattet. Kleiner Fitnessbereich - ok für Cross-Trainer und Laufband, sowie eine Handvoll Maschinen und Gewichte. Sicher deutlich über dem allgemeinen Hotelstandard in London was Preis/Leistung anbelangt. Gerne wieder. Kleiner Punktabzug, dass man kein Fenster öffnen kann, was aber Ansichtssache ist, insbesondere in der Innenstadt. Im Konferenzbereich war alles verfügbar für eine Tagung bis max. 30 Personen. Essen ist ok, aber nicht außergewöhnlich.",5,2018,04,11
115,Muy buen hotel con mejor personal,"Excelente atención tanto por parte del personal de recepción, donde Jero nos atendió en un perfecto español, y nos aconsejó en muchos aspectos prácticos, como por parte del personal de sala del servicio de desayunos: María, Estilita, Marina, Víctor y Dimitar.  Fue un placer la atención que nos dieron y el trato correctísimo que nos dispensaron.  El hotel está muy bien y la estancia fue muy agradable.  Los desayunos excelentes, pudiendo disfrutar del English breakfast en sus distintas variantes.  La habitación impecable con un baño enorme y limpísimo.  El hotel está muy bien ubicado, cerca del Metro y a un paso de Oxford Street y del British Museum.  Y con un paseo se llega a casi cualquiera de los principales puntos de interés de Londres.  Sin duda volveríamos si hiciésemos otro viaje allí.",5,2018,04,02
115,Comodo e bello,"Comodissimo per muoversi per Londra! Bello, moderno ma caratteristico, è nella zona dei teatri che risulta molto suggestiva.

Il personale è estremamente gentile e cordiale.

Ci sono più fermare della metro in zona.",5,2018,03,03
115,Tres tres chic!!,"In un fine settimana prenatalizio trovare una location di classe come il Bloomsbury rende il Natale ancora più intenso.

Sinonimo di classe, di comodità, di attenzione, di ottima accoglienza.

Grande la camera da letto, all’insegna del comfort, e comunque silenziosa, ovattata. Letto comodissimo. Sala da bagno all’altezza, pulita.
Personale curato, bello, attento.

Sacrificata la sala colazioni negli spazi al piano inferiore, ma ottima l’offerta, la qualità ed il servizio.

Il resto è Londra, e sei vicino a tutto.

Classe e qualità che si pagano, ma davvero volentieri.",4,2018,02,09
115,Ottimo Hotel! Consigliato!,"Ho pernottato a febbraio per due giorni con la mia ragazza, e ci siamo trovati benissimo, personale cordiale e soprattutto professionale.
Location Centrale, ottimo posto.
Buona colazione ed ottimo espresso, da gustare in versione double. :)
Pulizia delle Camere eccellente, inoltre sono ben fornite di tutto, ombrello,ferro ed asse da stiro, caffè,tè, acqua. (La sera ho chiesto una bustina di camomilla ed il personale me l'ha fornita in tempi brevissimi).
Consigliatissimo, ottimo anche il prezzo. Ci tornerò al mio prossimo viaggio a Londra.",5,2018,02,05
115,Luxuriöses Hotel in 1a Lage,"Das Beste an diesem Hotel ist definitiv die Lage. Man kann fußläufig komplett Soho in wenigen Minuten erreichen, das alleine reicht ja im Grunde schon aus.
Der Eingangsbereich die Terrasse und das Restaurant sind sehr chic und luxuriös, die Zimmer allerdings grenzwertig klein (trotz recht hohen, der Lage entsprechenden, Preisen). Die Ausstattung stimmt aber und da man ja eh nicht vor hat Stunden auf dem Zimmer zu verbringen passt das Gesamtpaket.",4,2018,01,06
115,It‘s like coming home,"Dieses wunderschöne Hotel hält wirklich alles,was es verspricht!
Von der erstklassigen luxuriösen Ausstattung über die überaus freundlichen Mitarbeiter bis hin zu dem ausgezeichneten Essen,findet man un diesem Hotel alles was einen gelungenen Urlaub ausmacht!
Abgesehen von der liebevoll gestalteten Dalloway Terrasse wo man herrlich Tea Time haben kann,sollte man auf jeden Fall in der kürzlich eröffneten Bar /Coral
Room einen Drink nehmen.Das Ambiente ist einmalig. Der Service ist ausgezeichnet!
Es ist für uns der 4. Aufenthalt in diesem Hotel und der nächste ist schon geplant!
Das Motto der Mitarbeiter: Geht nicht gibt es nicht!

Para repetir, sin duda...",5,2017,11,24
115,Sehr angenehmer Aufenthalt,"Sehr zuvor kommendes Personal, gutes Frühstück und jeden Tag frisches Obst auf den Zimmern. Das Hotel liegt nur 1 min. von der U-Bahn Station Tottenham Court entfernt. Werde wahrscheinlich wieder kommen.",5,2017,11,07
115,Por debajo de mis expectativas,Buenas instalaciones y buena ubicación. Solicité habitación doble con dos camas. Me dieron una con cama matrimonial porque no había las solicitadas. La habitación es correcta y el hotel está bien. Los grifos del baños son realmente complicados y de muy incómodo uso. El servicio de habitaciones nos dejó sin hacer la habitación hasta la tarde por lo que tras llegar a mediodía para descansar estaba todo sin hacer. El restaurante y desayuno están francamente bien y el gimnasio es pequeño pero correcto.,3,2017,11,06
115,Excelente hotel en Londres para alojarse y cenar,Personal muy muy atento y servicial. Excelente ubicación para visitar el British Museum. Habitaciones con todo lujo de detalles y camas muy confortables. La terraza es un lugar muy agradable para cenar. La única pega es que la carta del restaurante podría tener algún plato más.,5,2017,11,01
115,Ein bisschen wie zu Hause,"Wir waren schon einige Male im Bloomsbury, auch diesmal war alles von Anfang bis Ende schön und angenehm. Ich freue mich jedes Mal, das Hotelgebäude zu sehen, wenn ich mit dem Taxi ankomme, die Atmosphäre in der Lobby vermittelt das Gefühl, man sei in einer anderen Zeit, eben in der Zeit des ""Bloomsbury Set"". Die Angestellten sind alle freundlich, hilfsbereit und kompetent, man fühlt sich gleich willkommen. Die Zimmer sind gut ausgestattet (wenn möglich eins mit Blick auf die Great Russell Street buchen), das Frühstücksbuffet ist eine Freude, die nette Bedienung macht das Essen noch erfreulicher. Die Bar ist ein Klassiker. Und wenn man doch einmal rausgehen möchte und das Hotel durch den Haupteingang verlässt, kann man ganz bequem zu Fuss das British Museum, den Leicester Square oder Piccadilly Circus erreichen. Das Hotel sei allen ans Herz gelegt.",5,2017,10,16
115,HERMOSO HOTEL INMEJORABLE UBICACIÓN,A una cuadra de Tottenham Court Station y de Oxford Street. Caminamos como 30 minutos y llegamos al Big Ben. El hotel tiene habitaciones super confortables y lo único malo es que la cama es tan buena que no te quieres levantar por la mañana. El personal es muy profesional y muy amable.,5,2017,10,05
115,Jamas nos arrepentimos de volver..,Es la tercera vez que los visitamos . Son validos y muy eficientes . Destaco sobre todo al Sr Joao Carlos Vergueiro Night Manager  que supo con eficiencia y profesionalismo aclarar aquellos detalles que no habían resulto de excelencia . Decidimos volver próximamente gracias a eso . Felicitaciones !!!,4,2017,09,01
115,Ottima posizione ,Un bell'hotel a due passi da British Museum e dalla fermata di Tottenham court road. La camera non è così spaziosa ma ben pulita. In bagno si trovano buoni prodotti per l'igiene personale. Il personale è molto gentile e disponibile. A fianco all'hotel c'è un bel posto dove poter fare colazione senza spendere troppo.,4,2017,08,27
115,Muy bueno!!!,"Hospedarse en The Bloomsbury Hotel, es una experiencia excelente en varios sentidos. La ubicación inmejorable en el corazón de Bloombsbury, a un paso del British Museum, permite recorrer  cortas distancias en un Londres a pie, o en sus excelentes combinaciones del Tube.
La comodidad de las habitaciones.
La cordialidad en el trato de Suzanah, en recepción
Afternoon tea con Joan, inmejorable.
El English Breakfast es sobresaliente con la atención de María y su equipo (Nour, Marina, Kal, David, Victor), quienes  acompañan al huésped a un momento grato para degustar los sabores tradicionales londinenses
Jorge Mugni y Flia.",5,2017,08,10
115,alto nivel y excelente ubicacion,"muy buen hotel, distinguido y a 2 cuadras del British Museum. trato correctisimo y con posibilidad que te atiendan en tu idioma.

Volvería sin dudas.",5,2017,08,10
115,"Ruhiges, sauberes Hotel an bester Lage","Das Hotel ist gleich um die Ecke von der U-Bahn-Station Tottenham Court in einer ruhigen Strasse gelegen. Der Covent Garden mit Läden und Restaurants ist gut zu Fuss zu erreichen. Das British National Museum befindet sich an der selben Strasse in unmittelbarer Nähe. 
Wir hatten ein Superior-Zimmer im 5. Stock, das für Londoner Verhältnisse eine angenehme Grösse hatte. Das Zimmer selbst war sehr gepflegt und sauber. Die Angestellten durchwegs sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Die zum Hotel gehörende Dalloway Terrace und die im sous-sol gelegene Bar sind gemütlich für einen Snack oder einen Drink am Abend. Preis/Leistung insgesamt sind absolut top.",4,2017,07,18
115,Un piacevole soggiorno,"Approfitto di questa recensione per ringraziare Sirio, gentile e disponibile in ogni momento. Lo staff è semplicemente eccezionale! Consiglio questo hotel non solo per la bellezza, la comodità e la pulizia ma anche e soprattutto per l'accoglienza. Bravi! Tutto perfetto!",5,2017,07,13
115,Súper recomendable,"Muy bien ubicado, a 200 metros de estación de metro y Oxford Street y a solo 150 metros del British Museum.
Lugar refinado y cálido. Tiene un Bar muy romántico con música en vivo, pero lo que más nos llamó la atención es la calidez y la buena disposición del personal.
Desde Esteban en la puerta de entrada como los muchachos de la recepción JC, André y Sirio.
Estoy muy agradecido con ellos. Ojalá pueda volver pronto.

115,Lovely place to stay!!! ❤️,"Tre notti passate a Londra e gia' non vedo l'ora di tornare. L'abergo lo consiglio anche a chi non conosce la citta'. Si trova vicino ai miei quartieri preferiti Soho e Covent Garden e alla fermata del metro Tottenham Court Road, insomma da li' si arriva ovunque. L'albergo e' veramente bello e le camere pure anche se forse nella nostra ""Superior Room Queen Bed"" il bagno era un po' piccolo ma comunque pulitissimo!",4,2017,04,22
115,Hotel precioso,"Es un hotel precioso, bien situado a un paso del soho y del museo britanico. El personal es muy atento y tiene muchos servicios a tu disposicion, tiene botones, si quieres la prensa te la dejan cada mañana en la puerta de tu habitacion, incluso te encuentras la cama ta destapada para dormur cuando llegas por la noche con una chocolatina en la almohada. En españa se suele decir que los hoteles de 4 * en europa son peores q en España, pero con este hotel no se cumple. Es sin duda un 4* sup, el desayuno buffet muy completo y ademas tienen cada dia platos calientes elaborados aparte del buffet, nosotros probamos los huevos benedit y las tostadas francesas. Tengo que destacar la atencion de Giorgi y de Maria en l desayuno, fueron muy agradables y serviciales. Tambien probamos l té de la tarde en l restaurante del hotel y es toda una experiencia, te ponen una torre de tres plantas con sandwiches, bollitos y dulces, imposibles de terminartelos todos , y un litro de té. Tambien tienen un bar precioso ambientado en los años 20, decorado con muchisimo gusto, con cockteles buenisimos y con musica en vivo. Es un hotel fantastico y si vuelvo a Londres no dudare en repetir.",5,2017,04,17

115,Es un hotel viejo con algunas cosas modernizadas pero su estructura no permite grandes cambios,"El Bloomsbury es un hotel antiguo con los agradable que eso resulta, pero por ejemplo las habitaciones son oscuras y pequeñas en relación al precio.
La ubicación es buena cercana o relativamente cercana a todo.
A la habitación que nos dieron le faltaba mantenimiento ya que las paredes estaban oscurecidas por el hollín. Daba a un patio interno por lo que era sumamente oscura.
El personal de recepción y conserjes fueron muy amables y solícitos.
Solo es complicado el servicio de habitación. El primer día, por una supuesta superpoblación en el hotel, nos retiraron las batas y las pantuflas y no las recuperamos hasta como tres días después. Las amenities son correctas y eso si lo reponen abundantemente. 
A una media cuadra hay un supermercado que atiende hasta las doce de la noche y que tiene muchas variedad y buenos productos.
El servicio del bar es carísimo y la gente es muy poco amable, por no decir desagradable. Nos habían obsequiado (a raíz del tema de las sleepers)  un bono para tomar un refresco. Como era el día en que nos íbamos acudimos con nuestra ropa de viaje y notamos cierta discriminación. Apenas nos sirvieron lo que decía el bono y no nos ofrecieron nada mas como dando por sentado que no querríamos. Especialmente la Srta. que atendía mostraba muy poca amabilidad y cierto tono despectivo...

Meravigliosa veranda addobbata per Natale in cui abbiamo potuto fare colazione il giorno della partenza,

115,"Buon hotel, ma qualità prezzo no","Buon hotel situato in un'ottima posizione nel centro di Londra, lo staff è molto cordiale e sempre disposto ad accontentare ogni richiesta del cliente.
Le camere sono ben pulite e arredate ma piccole (superior room) e il bagno è decisamente minuscolo per un hotel di questa fascia.
Qualità/prezzo non delle migliori quindi..
Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per l'ultimo dell'anno e ovviamente un sovrapprezzo era giustificato ma se devo spendere 200€ a notte ( senza nemmeno colazione inclusa) esigo una stanza all'altezza.

",3,2017,01,02
115,Immer wieder toll!,"Ich war schon mehrmals in diesem Hotel, allein, mit einer Freundin und mit meinen Kindern. Es liegt angenehm nah an U-Bahn- und Bushaltestellen. Verschiedene Theater, das British Museum und Covent Garden kann man bequem zu Fuss erreichen. 
Die gute Lage, das schöne Gebäude, die einladende Lobby, die hübschen Zimmer (manchmal etwas klein), der Service und das äusserst freundliche und hilfsbereite Personal, das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis, ..., es gibt viele gute Gründe, das Bloomsbury zu wählen.

115,Ottimo,"Abbiamo soggiornato una notte in questo hotel, la prima volta. E' in una bella zona, con fermata metro vicina, quindi comodo. L'hotel e' molto carino, le camere semplici, in stile, belle. Il servizio e' cortese. Il rapporto qualita' prezzo molto buono.",4,2016,12,22

In der direkten Umgebung ist das British Museum. Gleichermaßen kann in den umgebenden Straßen eingekauft oder in vielen Restaurants gegessen werden und dies sehr interkulturell.

Der Service ist außergewöhnlich gut, die Zimmer sehr angenehm ausgestattet. 

Ich war zu einer Konferenz dorthin eingeladen und fand das Frühstücksbuffet und auch das Mittagessenangebot hervorragend. ",5,2016,11,21
115,Otra vez perfecto,"Nos hemos alojado varias veces en esto hotel y la verdad es que nunca decepciona. Su ubicación, encanto, ... posiblemente el único punto a comentar algo sería la sala del desayuno que podría ser mejor por poner un punto de mejora pero ya está.

El hotel está perfectamente situado cerca de restaurantes, atracciones turísticas, tiendas,... y las estaciones de metro a dos pasos que te llevan directo al aeropuerto de Heathrow.

La medida de las habitaciones varía. La clásica es un poco pequeña y vale la pena pagar un poco más por la superior/deluxe. Esta última vez nos alojamos en la suite y verdaderamente era muy grande con un baño enorme.

La zona está muy bien porque es una calle tranquila pero en un minuto caminando estás en pleno bullicio.",4,2016,11,15
115,Cordialità e gentilezza,"Sono rimasta particolarmente stupida dalla gentilezza dello staff, dalla reception alla sala colazioni. Tutti davvero molto cordiali. La camera era molto spaziosa e il bagno pulito, se devo proprio evidenziare un neo della stanza è la poca luminosità perché le finestre affacciavano su una corte interna. La colazione era abbondante ed erano presenti cibi dolci e salati. Anche il ristorante dell'hotel aveva personale molto preparato. Unica nota sfavorevole, il personale delle camere, non tutti sapevano bene l'inglese, infatti ci è stato difficile recuperare una coperta, e per un paio di giorni mancava un accappatoio nella stanza. Niente di trascendentale. Nel complesso ottimo hotel, dal personale alle camere e soprattutto alla posizione.",4,2016,11,11
115,sitio altamente recomendable,"Es un hotel con aroma a club privado ingles  La atencion en general desde keepersdoor,valets,. conserjes,mucamas ,recepcion Jeronimo(Jero) y en el breakfast Maria, todos ellos hacen que uno se sienta a gusto realmente.

115,Ottima struttura,"Ho soggiornato in questa struttura ad agosto 2016 con la mia famiglia. Hotel molto curato e di recente ristrutturazione. Le nostre camere standard erano molto curate ma non grandissime. Pulizia impeccabile. La colazione il vero punto di forza, anche perchè sono riuscito a trovare un'offerta in cui la colazione era inclusa nel prezzo. Tutto molto buono, sia il buffet che alla carta, di prima scelta. Un Ringraziamento e una lode speciale ai camerieri Sara (italiana, gentilissima), Georgi e Daniela, ragazzi disponibilissimi, gentilissimi e soprattutto molto professionali, non ci hanno mai fatto mancare nulla.

Nach größerer Recherche im Internet entschied man sich für das Bloomsbury: zentral aber dennoch ruhig gelegen, schöne Zimmer und alles das an Infrastruktur vorhanden, was man/frau so benötigt.
Gebucht war eine Suite mit der ausdrücklichen Bitte, doch möglichst NICHT im obersten Stockwerk (=Dachetage) untergebracht zu werden. Der Grund: eifriges Suchen im Internet hatte ergeben, dass diese Suite deutlich dunkler (allerdings auch deutlich größer) als die unteren Suiten zu sein schien.
Sehr freundlicher Check-In - aber leider mit dem Ergebnis, dass wir auf die oberste Etage gebucht waren. Nach einem ersten Spaziergang nahmen wir uns ein Herz und fragten nach einer Alternative - die obere Suite war zwar gigantisch groß, leider aber auch recht dunkel und das Bad ohne separate Toilette (letzteres ein deutlicher Nachteil bei drei Bewohnern). Man bat uns, einen Moment zu warten.... und begleitete uns dann persönlich in zwei weitere Suiten (in den Stockwerken darunter) zwischen denen wir auswählen konnten. Beide waren bis auf geringfügige Unterschiede hinsichtlich der Möblierung gleich geschnitten, schön hell und mit abgetrennter Toilette versehen. Wir waren begeistert und nahmen den Vorschlag zu wechseln dankbar an. Die Hilfsbereitschaft, mit der unser Wunsch nach Zimmerwechsel behandelt wurde, suchte wirklich ihresgleichen - vorbildlich! Die Bitte nach einer zweiten Decke für unser King-Size-Bett war dann quasi nur eine Nebensache, der aber sofort entsprochen wurde.
Frühstück war sehr lecker, vielfältig und ansprechend präsentiert. Einzig, dass man im ""Keller"" saß (und dieser Umstand auch nicht durch die Innenarchitektur kaschiert werden konnte) war ein kleiner Wehrmutstropfen.
Unsere drei Tage in London waren vollgepackt mit Ausflügen und Besichtigungen. Einen kleinen Nachmittagssnack in der Bar hätten wir deshalb das ein oder andere Mal gerne genommen. Hier kam eine Besonderheit der Briten zutage: Minderjährige sind in Bars auch wenn es nur darum geht, eine Kleinigkeit zu essen, bis auf Ausnahmen nicht gestattet. Unser Barmenu haben wir deshalb in den Hotellounge genommen. Eigentlich auch ganz schön, aber es dauerte doch ein wenig länger, weil das sehr freundliche Personal, das ja im Keller saß, quasi hellseherische Fähigkeiten besitzen musste, um zu erkennen, das z.B. ""Nachschub"" gewünscht wurde.
Das Lunchangebot zur Mittagszeit haben wir mit Freunden ebenfalls getestet und sehr ansprechend gefunden.
Alles in allem ein sehr runder Aufenthalt. Wir kommen gerne wieder.",4,2016,08,22
115,Ruidoso,"Evitar habitación 319. El ruido de las maquinas de ventilación no permite conciliar el sueño.  La respuesta ante mi queja fue, no tenemos habitaciones libres.

115,Quasi perfetto .....,"Cominciamo dall'unico punto negativo: il bagno , troppo piccolo e  scomodo per due persone (forse anche per una) . Detto questo non posso che confermare gli ottimi giudizi degli altri viaggiatori . Un bellissimo hotel a cominciare dalla facciata in tipico stile inglese a mattoncini , per continuare nella bella hall . Camera pulita e con tutti i confort . Avevamo paura della temutissima ""moquette"" inglese e del suo profumino ... non proprio gradevole ma ci siamo dovuti ricredere . Troverete la macchina da caffe' Nespresso rifornita quotidianamente con tre cialde gratis , due bottiglie di acqua (sempre gratis) , filtri per il the' .Ottima l'accoglienza e la professionalità dello staff . Posizione : fermata della metro Tottenham Court Road a 3 minuti , British Museum a 2 (praticamente di fronte all'hotel)  , National Gallery lontana ... 15 minuti. Se vi volete muovere a piedi , Covent Garden , Soho , Piccadilly sono a portata di una piacevolissima passeggiata di pochi minuti .Provata la colazione , ottima ma .... non economica come del resto il prezzo della camera . Che dire .... ve lo consiglio !!",4,2016,07,09
115,Perfect hotel for a stay in London,Albergo incantevole situato nel centro di Londra. A pochi minuti da Piccadilly Circus e da Bond Street. Ideale per chi vuol fare un weekend di shopping. È in assoluto il mio albergo preferito a Londra. Siamo stati per 3 notti nel luglio del 2012 l'ultima volta e ne eravamo completamente soddisfatti!! Grazie per averci fatto un upgrade in una junior suite. La camera era stupenda! Ritorneremo sicuramente!!,5,2016,07,01
115,Experiencia,"Si usted ha viajado al nordeste de Brasil hospedándose en hoteles 4 estrellas y desea, al viajar a Londres, ese nivel de servicio, confort y atención, permítame entonces  recomendarle el Hotel Bloomsbury. En él encontrará no sólo servicio y eficiencia, sino también algo muy importante para nosotros los latinos: la calidez de su personal.
Una mención aparte merecen Estelita y María, quienes tienen a su cargo el English Breakfast, y brindan una orientación inmejorable para que uno pueda disfrutar todo tipo de sabores.
No se pierdan la experiencia del afternoon tea, con las sugerencias de Joan. 
Por último, disfruten del ambiente acogedor de la Terrace Dalloway, en donde la cena les resultará inolvidable.

Wir verbrachten dort eine volle Woche und hatten am Anfang mit unserem Zimmer (superior) einfach Pech. Es hatte Fenster zu einem dunklen Innenhof, und vor allem eine sehr laute Klimaanlage, die wohl kaputt war. Nach unserer Reklamation bekamen wir zu einem frühest möglichen Termin ein neues Zimmer (upgrade) mit dem wir voll zufrieden waren. Der Servis war sehr nett und zuvorkommend.

Por dentro el hotel es precioso y las habitaciones también y en ellas dispones de todo tipo de amenities (Nespresso, galletitas, tes, albornoces, zapatillas, etc. Todo tipo de detalles que, aunque parezca una tontería, hacen tu estancia muy cómoda), con caja fuerte, wifi gratis, plancha, tabla de planchar para un imprevisto, etc. Lo recomiendo 100%.

Ante mi decepción ,volví a recepción y enseñé la foto q aparecía en la hoja de Booking.com q llevaba conmigo. No pudieron ninguna pega y al cabo de dos horas ya estábamos en otra habitación en la quinta planta con ventana a la calle y mucho más amplia . Lo que había pagado. Pero si no me hubiera quejado, cosa q me disgusta hacer, nos quedamos en un zulo por más de 200€ la noche. Por lo demás, estuvimos muy bien aunque Londres está más caro que nunca .

Habitación muy comoda y limpia.

115,Buen hotel con cosas a mejorar,"Lo mejor:
La ubicación, casi al lado del British Museum y de Oxford Street, cerca de metro y bus, con muchos restaurantes y comercios por la zona. El edificio es antiguo, muy bonito, y está muy bien cuidado, las habitaciones bien decoradas y cuidadas, bastante espaciosas para ser londres, y bien iluminadas; las camas muy cómodas, aunque un poco altas.
Lo peor:
No tiene vistas, es un hotel pequeño por lo que no es muy alto, la calle de atrás es estrecha por lo que desde esa fachada sólo ves pared y ventanas, la calle lateral y la frontal, que son las más abiertas, seguramente son para las habitaciones de más categoría, por lo que si tu habitación es estándar no esperes vistas abiertas desde tu ventana, serán o al callejón de atrás o al patio interior.

El personal es amable sin agobiar, el hotel es antiguo pero está muy bien mantenido y cuidado, los materiales son de calidad. El desayuno consiste en un buffet pequeño con fiambres fríos, fruta, cereales, leche....... el resto es a la carta, desayuno inglés, goffres, etc... Hay variedad y la comida está muy buena. Las habitaciones son espaciosas y cómodas, muy silenciosas, armario grande, caja fuerte con capacidad para portátil, cafetera, plancha, secador y hasta una nespresso; los baños cuidados y con buen sistema de agua caliente. La tv de patalla plana y enorme. También hay aire acondicionado-calefacción. 
Mi mayor queja, dejando a un lado la falta de vistas, es la poca organización que tiene el servicio de limpieza. No hay carteles para las puertas para avisar que no quieres que te molesten o que has salido y quieres que limpien el cuarto, con lo cual el servicio pasa cuando le parece y llamando a la puerta para comprobar si estás, lo cual cuando estás durmiendo o en la ducha es un agobio. En dos ocasiones regresé al hotel por la tarde y la habitación seguía sin hacer, por lo que tuve que llamar para que vinieran. A veces también pasan por la tarde-noche para ver si quieres que te abran la cama y te repongan artículos de baño. De nuevo un agobio si quieres dormir o descansar y sin el cartel de no molestar no puedes hacerlo. La limpieza en el baño bien, pero en la moqueta es muy insuficiente, y debajo de los muebles y las camas ni se molestan en limpiar, horrible si eres alérgico al polvo. Un día se me cayó algo bajo la cama y al ir a recogerlo casi muero de asco. Lo mismo pasa con la manta extra que hay en el armario, no está guardada en plástico y no se molestan en sacudirla a diario o en cambiarla, por lo que está de polvo hasta arriba. El personal que trabaja limpiando es muy amable y siempre acudieron rápido al llamarlos, pero como digo están muy mal organizados y eso hace que la limpieza en sí se resienta mucho. 
¿Volvería? Sabiendo que sigue sin haber carteles para las puertas es posible que no, soy una persona que pasa bastante tiempo en el hotel cuando viajo y espero poder descansar cuando estoy en él, cosa imposible si no puedes informar de que no quieres ser molestado o de que quieres tener la habitación limpia al volver. Tampoco lo haría si no mejoran el tema de la aspiración, para un alérgico es un infierno una aspiradora mal pasada o ropa de cama sin airear. Mejorando esos dos detalles sin duda lo recomendaría porque ha sido uno de los hoteles más bonitos que he visitado y la atención en general ha sido muy buena, además de contar con un buena desayuno y wifi gratis, algo fundamental hoy en día en cualquier hotel.",4,2015,10,23

115,"Eccellente posizione, ottimo hotel","Eccellente posizione, centralissimo, davvero vicino al British Museum, a Oxford Street, al Covent Garden e a 10 minuti a piedi da Trafalgar Square.
Fermata metro Tottenham Court a 100 metri, servitissimo dagli autobus.
I teatri sono a due passi e la zona è piena di ristoranti e punti di ristoro.

Tea, Nespresso, acqua e biscottini complimentary in camera. 
Comodo letto king size e spazi non angusti in camera superior.
Wi-Fi incluso. 
Gradevolissimo profumo nella hall e meravigliosi comodi divani che creano una piacevole accoglienza.
Ci siamo stati molto bene e facilmente ci torneremo.

Tuttavia, ci sono alcuni miglioramenti da fare per meritarsi i ""cinque pallini"" su TripAdvisor.
Con un rapporto qualità prezzo non proprio eccezionale (una media di 270 € a notte, per 4 notti) sia pure in alta stagione, si fa fatica a perdonare anche gli errori meno gravi.

La camera era impeccabilmente pulita, ma trovare i pigiami in un mucchio sul comodino, non mi è piaciuto affatto. Come il fatto che la saponettina (una sola) non sia mai stata rifornita, come invece è stato  per gli altri prodotti da bagno, a onor del vero.
Siamo stati sfortunati e, al ritorno dopo un'intera giornata in giro, la porta della camera non si è aperta. Abbiamo dovuto fare avanti e indietro due volte finchè qualcuno è venuto a controllare e ha  scoperto che si era completamente scaricata la batteria della serratura . Dopo un'attesa di 15 minuti nei comodi divani della hall (che alle 22, e dopo chilometri, a noi è parsa un'eternità) e solo dopo mia richiesta, ci è stata data una camera d'appoggio.
Alla fine, dopo circa un'ora dall'arrivo, siamo potuti rientrare in camera, ma il disagio è stato grande.
E in un hotel di questo tipo ti aspetti, il giorno dopo, di trovare un biglietto di scuse, o un invito per un drink (sono astemia e non mi interessa, ma apprezzo il gesto), o un mazzo di fiori...
E' vero che la Direzione, dopo che ho compilato il questionario on line, è stata molto cortese, si è scusata e ci ha offerto una colazione al prossimo soggiorno. Ma le scuse sarebbero state più gradite durante il soggiorno, non dopo
Comunque...meglio tardi che mai!

A parte questi nei, totalmente perdonabili se le stelle non fossero quattro,  è stato un buon soggiorno e il Bloomsbury Hotel rimane un hotel sicuramente consigliabile.",4,2015,01,18

Camera ben fornita e di ottime dimensioni, personale disponibile e sorridente, solo il breakfast non mi è sembrato all'altezza, con un buffet molto ben fornito ma un servizio un lento (o forse sfortunato...) inoltre la sala della colazione, seppur accogliente, si trova nel seminterrato.
Sicuramente verificherò sempre la disponibilità di questo hotel in occasione dei mie prossimi soggiorni a Londra !",5,2015,01,01
115,Muy bonito,Un hotel situado perfectamente que tiene de todo cerca. Las habitaciones limpias y con todo lo que se puede esperar en ella. El desayuno muy caro pero se puede desayunar en los muchos bares que hay cerca del hotel. El personal muy agradable y profesional.,5,2014,12,30
115,Gerne wieder!,"Das Hotel war an Super Lage. Die Oxford Street liegt sozusagen fast vor der Türe. Das Personal war nett und hilfsbereit. Das Zimmer war für 3 Tage ganz okey, klein aber fein, mit dem Nötigsten ausgestattet. Das Bett war ein bisschen unbequem aber unser Ziel war shoppen und nicht die Prinzessin auf der Erbse spielen;-) Wir kommen gerne wieder in das Hotel!",4,2014,12,27
115,Immer wieder gerne!,"Wunderschönes Hotel auf 5* Standard, außer dass natürlich wenige Dinge dazu fehlen.. Die Zimmer sind wunderschön, Betten extrem Bequem. Die Lobby duftet wunderbar...

1. Aufenthalt war absolut 5* wunderbares Zimmer.

2. Aufenthalt war auch super, bis auf dass Zimmer welches für Leute mit Rollstuhl war... Toilette viel zu hoch, überall rote Notfall Schnüre...

Würde auf jedenfalls immer wieder gehen... ",5,2014,12,12
115,Ottimo Hotel,"ci sono stato pochi giorni fa con la mia ragazza.
posizione veramente ottima e centrale.
albergo meraviglioso, hall da favola.
camera piccola ma bellissima.
ciabatte in camera, shampoo, balsamo serviti.
sulla scrivania a disposizione gratuiti: acqua, biscottini, the, caffè (macchina e cialde Espresso)
3 cose negative:
manca lo spazzolone del water.
tutte le sere verso 19/20 passa stanza per stanza bussando per il servizio lavanderia. nel caso qualcuno riposi (come nel nostro caso dopo ore a camminare) è abbastanza spiacevole.
l'ultima sera all'1.00 del mattino è partito un'allarme nella nostra stanza ma penso anche in quelle vicine dell'antincendio (forse qualcuno ha provato a fumare in stanza) durato 20 secondi e poi più nulla.
noi dormivamo bellamente e l'alllarme m'ha fatto perdere 30anni di vita.

nonostante tutto ve lo consiglio",5,2014,12,10
115,Sigue siendo perfecto,"De nuevo repetí en este hotel aunque en esta ocasión al viaje de trabajo se unió mi familia y extendimos la visita unos días. El personal del hotel es extremadamente amable, la cama perfecta, las amenities una maravilla, la ducha con agua a presión que tanto cuesta encontrar en esta ciudad, el desayuno variado y de calidad... 100% recomendable. Se nota en el precio, pero merece la pena sin duda. ",5,2014,12,02
115,vicino a tutto,"Centrale e raggiungibile molto facilmente .... molto pulito e tranquillo! Le stanze non sonno grandissime ma hanno tutti i comfort possibili e immaginabili,i bagni hanno sia doccia che bagno! Lo consiglio vivamente....colazione fantastica!",4,2014,12,02
115,Hermoso hotel en un excelente lugar,"El hotel es pequeño, pero con una pulcritud típicamente británica. Excelente la atención y muy cómoda la habitación, pese a que no era muy amplia, pero lo suficiente para nuestro viaje. De destacar la ubicación, a pocos metros de Hyde Park y con acceso a todos los medios de transporte. Recomendable",4,2014,10,31
115,Super Hotel,"Für ein NFLUK Spiel waren wir 4 Tagen in London und waren begeistert von diesem Hotel. Das Zimmer war sehr sauber und für Londoner Verhältnisse sehr gross. Super Lage, zentral und doch ruhig. Tube Station wenige Schritte vom Hotel entfernt aber auch zu Fuss ist man schnell überall. Kostenloses WiFi im Zimmer. Das Personal war immer sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit, Check-in und Ticket Erhalt lief 1a und auch bei einem Problem im Zimmer wurde sofort geholfen und dieses behoben. Das Frühstücksbuffet war auch sehr gut, es gibt 2 unterschiedlich Varianten, nur Buffet, was auch ausreichend ist, oder mit warmen Speisen, von Omletts bis Full English Breakfast. Die Bar am Abend ist in Ordnung. Für London ist dies unsere neue 1. Wahl geworden, einfach ein super Hotel.",5,2014,10,14
115,nice business hotel,"Zimmer sehr sauber, sehr freundliches Personal. Wir waren  etwas enttäuscht ¨über das kleine Zimmer. Das Bad war dafür umso schöner, leider kam nicht viel Wasser aus der Dusche. Die Lage ist sehr zentral.",4,2014,10,09
115,Muy recomendable!!,"Habitaciones muy comodas, limpias y confortables. La Ubicacion del hotel super buena! Queremos destacar la amabilidad del personal!!  En especial, Beatriz una española muy simpatica, que nos oriento y sugirio lugares desconocidos para nosotros. Tambien destacamos a Leo Altobello, un argentino que nos hace sentir orgullosos por su profesionalismo y que nos hizo sentir como en casa! Y no podemos olvidarnos de Mubarak, quien nos traslado al aeropuerto con una amabilidad pocas veces vista. Queremos volver!!!",4,2014,10,04
115,Un ottimo hotel in un ottima posizione di Londra,"Nel bellissimo quartiere di Bloomsbury, difronte al British Museum, distante 10 minuti a piedi da Trafalguar Square, attaccato alla fermata della metro Tottenham Court, diverse fermate di autobus nelle vicinanze.
Personale cordiale e sempre disponibile.
Un'ottima base per vivere la bellissima Londra.",5,2014,10,02
115,"Muy buena opción en el centro, aunque habitación superior pequeña","El hotel tiene una ubicación excelente, perfecta para conocer la ciudad. A pesar de su cercanía a la ajetreada Oxford Street y al British Museum, sorprende la tranquilidad en esta calle. Está a un paso de Covent Garden y el Soho, ideales para comer, cenar o simplemente pasear, y también junto al metro (Tottenham, Holborn). El hotel es elegante y confortable, y todo su personal muy amable y servicial.
Aunque no lo buscaba, hice la reserva con el desayuno incluido porque, aunque caro, por un precio similar al de otros hoteles en régimen de sólo alojamiento, y bastante peor valorados en Tripadvisor, conseguí este hotel con desayuno. Así que hicimos una reserva con ""english breakfast"" sin saber muy bien en qué consistiría, y la sorpresa fue que nos incluyó todo el buffet y además un plato caliente de la carta de desayunos por persona, lo cual resultó excelente y muy práctico a la vez.
Nos alojamos durante seis noches. Habíamos reservado una habitación superior y, desde mi punto de vista era pequeña, al menos para lo que acostumbramos en España. Cuando entramos lo comentamos con el botones, quien llamó a recepción inmediatamente y nos confirmó que se trataba de una habitación superior. A mi me sigue cabiendo la duda, ya que la web del hotel indica que las habitaciones superiores incluyen un sillón y la nuestra no lo tenía, ni tampoco hubiera cabido en ella. A pesar de todo, la habitación era muy completa en cuanto a servicios y amenities, que reponían diariamente sin excepción. El baño no era muy grande, pero suficiente. Detalles como las botellas de agua, el servicio de café (Nespresso) y té, con galletitas y bombones, wifi, el periódico, la plancha y tabla de planchar, uno de los enchufes de la habitación adaptado ""a la española"", el acondicionador para el pelo o el albornoz y las zapatillas, nos gustaron mucho, pero hubo algunos otros mejorables. La cama era un poco blanda y al tumbarte tendías a hundirte hacia el centro y chocar con el otro. El minibar era realmente un dispensador de bebidas, por lo que no había sitio disponible para enfriar tus propios alimentos. También escuchamos puntualmente ruidos de instalaciones que creímos identificar con la climatización, aunque nosotros no la pusimos en marcha, o puede que fuera un sistema automático de ambientadores (con muy buen aroma, por cierto).
En fin, recomiendo el hotel y volvería, aunque me quedo con la espinita clavada respecto al tamaño de la habitación.",4,2014,08,28
115,Altamente recomendable,"Empezando por su estratégica ubicación, a 200 mts del subterráneo, en el elegante y tranquilo barrio de Bloomsbury, y sobre todo la amabilidad de sus empleados, resaltando a Hugo, un español de Santander quien siempre tuvo respuestas y sugerencias adecuadas, con mucha pprofesionalidad y conocimientos, realmente muy recomendable. Como única sugerencia que mejoren un desnivel que existe en algunos dormitorios, suelen ser peligrosos. Lo demás excelente, en nuestro regreso a Londres no dudaremos en elegir este Hotel. Pepe y Alicia de Argentina",4,2014,08,28
115,Perfecto,"Ideal para ir al British caminando, perfectas las habitaciones, el personal muy simpático trataba de atenderte en todo momento. Limpias y amplias, una monada. Y la zona está fenomenal, con un súper donde venden comida recién hecha, perfecta para comerla en uno de los parques. Volveré!!!",4,2014,08,27
115,Signorile e tipicamente british,Situato in posizione ottimale per visitare la città a due passi dalla vivissima Oxford strett e alla stazione tottenham road della metró é una sistemazione ideale e confortevole per una bella esperienza londinese.Il personale è cortese e professionale anche se nessuno parla italiano. Tuttavia la disponibilità è tale da superare l'inconveniente. Le camere seppur non grandissime sono ben disposte e la pulizia è ottimale e impeccabile. La colazione è ricca e completa di alimenti di ottima qualità mentre il personale di sala è prontissimo ad accogliere ogni richiesta in maniera immediata. Sono entusiasta dei giorni trascorsi a Londra perché la città è incantevole come pure la sistemazione e il trattamento ricevuto.,5,2014,08,20
115,Muy céntrico.,"El hotel esta situado estratégicamente bien, cerca de los museos, las tiendas y los grandes teatros con musicales, y de la Royal Ópera House.
Las habitaciones superiores son muy amplias. Tienen cafetera y tetera, te ponen agua con gas y sin gas cada día, unas galletas y bombones. El desayuno tienen dos uno a la carta y otro continental. El personal es muy atento y servicial. Nosotros llevamos muchos años viniendo aquí y nos encontramos como en casa.

",4,2014,07,29
115,impresionante,"Hotel céntrico en Londres, con altas combinaciones de transporte en todos los sentidos, hotel de lujo, con habitaciones la superior que escogimos nosotros se adaptaba lo que se exponía por internet, una gozada de habitación, con espacio para café y tea en la misma habitación, el servicio muy atento a todo lo que le pides, el desayuno tipo bufet pero te ofrecen platos de cocina sin problema, en fin un lugar que no es barato pero vale la pena. Genial y altamente recomendable.  Repetiría seguro.",5,2014,07,01
115,Perfecto,"Estuve 4 noches en primer momento y luego de un tour, 2 noches más.
Este hotel es como deberían ser todos los hoteles, más alla de ser más o menos lujosos.
Desde el momento que llegas, te tratan en forma excelente, en la recpeción te dan toallitas calientes para que te limpies las manos y un refresco; en la puerta misma, al verte llegar, se acerca el portero para ayudarte con las valijas. todo es servicio.
Las habitaciones son normales, ni chicas ni grandes, cómodas, con un amoblamiento clásico pero moderno, baño completo (en habitaciones standard superior), con buenos porductos de tocador. Dan café y té de cortesía y dos botellas de agua mineral.
El desayuno es muy completo, con fiambres, quesos, frutas, cereales, jugos, etc etc; además está la opción gourmet, que es una selección de 7 ú 8 platos calientes que se preparan en el momento, a pedido.
Para los fumadores ( para todos en realidad), tiene una terraza en planta baja donde despuntar el vicio o tomar un poco de aire fresco rodeado de plantas. 
La ubicación es muy buena, cerca del subte y de numerosas líneas de buses, a pocas cuadras de Oxford St (lo que asegura comercios abiertos hasta tarde) y Covent Garden y el Soho.
Cunado vuelva a Londres, definitivamente, volveré a este hotel.",5,2014,06,30
115,Excelente opcion!!!!,estuve alojada en mayo 2014. las habitaciones son pequeñas pero muy comodas. excelente desayuno y la ubicacion es inmejorable!!!! Personal muy amable y solucionan todas las inquietudes. Felicitaciones y gracias!!!!,5,2014,06,20
115,Gute Lage in London,"Wir waren Anfang Dezember zum Weihnachtsshopping in London, das Hotel Bloomsbury haben wir vor allem wegen der zentralen Lage bzw. guten Tube-Anbindungen gebucht.
Das Hotel ist schön, die Zimmer sind klein und ein wenig ""verstaubt""... 
Schade, dass das Restaurant und die Hotelbar im Keller des Hotels ohne Ausblick sind, Qualität des Frühstücks für Londoner Verhältnisse ausgezeichnet. Hotelbar abends ganz nett für den kleinen ""Absacker"".",4,2014,06,04
115,"Lo mejor, su ubicación","Un buen hotel, con zonas comunes excelentes. El personal, encantador. A un paso de un montón de sitios, como Covent Garden y, sobre todo, resulta irresistible que esté pegado al Museo Británico. Muy recomendable. Quizá el precio, al menos cuando estuvimos nosotros, un tanto elevado. Si podéis pillar una oferta de algún tipo, no dejéis escapar este hotel.",4,2014,06,03
115,Charme a un passo dalla caotica Soho,"Camera e bagno spaziosi, confortevoli e curati nei dettagli. Personale cordiale, cortese e assolutamente disponibile. Ubicazione perfetta per muoversi in città e riposare in un angolo tranquillo. Molto piacevole il cocktail bar interno, dove preparano un ottimo Pimm's e si può ascoltare del buon jazz.",5,2014,05,27
115,Every time a .... perfect experience,"Non e' la prima volta per me al The Bloomsbury. Scelgo di soggiornare in questo hotel ogni volta mi trovi a londra per motivi di business. L'atmosfera e' eccezionale. C'e' nell'aria il sapore della vecchia Londra, elegante e signorile, educata e gentile, arricchita da nuovi sentori di spezie orientali. Amo questo hotel per tutto: la location, la professionalita' e gentilezza dello staff, la sobria eleganza degli ambienti... ogni volta al The Bloomsbury una esperienza perfetta!",5,2014,04,26
115,Top hotel,The Bloomsbury Hotel ist ein Hotel an einer super Lage. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Sie haben uns super Tickets für ein Musical organisiert. Der Service ist top. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist in Ordnung.Es sind nette Restaurants und sogar eine Apotheke in der Nähe. ,5,2014,04,26
115,Absolutamente perfecto,"Ya sea por su privilegiada ubicacion, como por la cordialidad y hospitalidad de su gente, este hotel le va a brindar una experiencia en extremo agradable.Las habitaciones estan equipadas con todo lo necesario para pasarla bien: Led TV,Cafetera Nespresso y variedades de te y aguas minerales (sin cargo), dock station con parlantes Ipod/ipad,caja fuerte,etc,etc.La lista es interminable.
Su ubicacion privilegiada, permite llegar caminando a Covent Garden, Oxford Circus,British Museum, Leicester Square y demas atracciones. Con lo cual, luego de tomar el desayuno,en donde encontraran una muy variada carta de platos calientes y comidas (aparte de las opciones habituales), podran salir a descubir esta maravillosa ciudad.
Las habitaciones estan decoradas con un gusto exquisito y son sumamente silenciosas para descansar de una jornada de largas caminatas.
Sin dudas este hotel sera mi eleccion en mi proxima visita.",5,2014,04,25
115,"Bell'albergo, peccato il materasso.","Decisamente un albergo di ottimo livello, anche i loro prezzi lo sono...
Offre tutte le comodità e i servizi che ci si deve attendere da un simile hotel; peccato che il materasso fosse o molto vecchio o troppo morbido per che ha problemi di schiena. Al mattino ci si sveglia più stanche della sera precedente.
Molto cortesi e professionali sia alla réception che il concierge. Disponibilissimi e sorridenti.
Ottima la posizione, quasi di fronte al British Museum.",4,2014,03,27
115,London,"Das Hotel ist an einer guten Lage und trotzdem sehr ruhig.Das Personal sehr zuvorkommend.
Nur wenige Meter von der u Bahn Station und in der Nähe des Britisch Museum.
Und gut zu Fuss ins Soho und China Town.",5,2014,03,26
115,Tolle Zeit/ Great time,"Wir hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt im Bloomsburyhotel während unserem Kurztrip in London. Wir kamen morgens früh an um ca.9 Uhr. Da um diese Zeit unsere Zimmer natürlich noch nicht bezugsbereit waren,spendierte uns das Hotel ein Frühstück. Das hatten wir gar nicht erwartet und waren positiv überrascht:). Die Zimmer sind schön und sauber und vom Lärm der Oxfordstreet,welche 2 min vom Hotel entfernt liegt,kriegt man gar nichts mit. Der Hotelpage Brian gab uns wertvolle Tipps rund um die Stadt und allgemein war er sehr zuvorkommend und symphathisch.Wir würden uns auf jeden Fall wieder für dieses Hotel entscheiden!",5,2014,03,08
115,Ottimo hotel nei pressi del British Museum,"Hotel molto bello e curato con personale gentile e che, all'eventualità, parla anche italiano. E' vicinissimo al British Museum e alla fermata della metro di Tottenham Court Road. L'edificio, evidentemente antico, è stato ristrutturato e modernizzato in modo magistrale, senza eliminare il fascino dello stabile (sia interno che esterno).
Servizio ottimo ma direi che 50 sterline per una colazione è decisamente troppo, soprattutto senza comunicazione agli ospiti e senza la varietà che ci si aspetterebbe. Ad ogni modo, basta mettere in conto di fare colazione fuori e si è a posto, visto che ci sono numerosi bar, Starbucks e Costa nei dintorni.
Vicinissimo alla metro con la quale si raggiunge ogni parte della città e vicinissimo al Dominion Theatre (dove abbiamo assistito allo spettacolo omaggio sui Queen).
Possibilità di lasciare senza problemi i bagagli in custodia fino alla partenza e anche all'arrivo se le camere non sono pronte.",4,2014,02,25
115,ottima scelta,"hotel davvero molto bello e curato.personale disponibile e molto gentile.le camere sono davvero ampie,hanno letti comodi e dei bellissimi bagni. davvero comodissimo per chi vuole visitare Londra ed essere in pieno centro. ritornerò!",5,2014,02,04
115,Estancia increíble igual que el trato,"Viajamos en familia a Londres a finales del mes de Agosto del 2013, realizamos la reserva del hotel mediante una agencia de viajes que nos contrató todo lo del mismo viaje. Se trata de un hotel con encanto propio, con sus particulares pequeños detalles en la recepción del hotel. Cabe resaltar su inmejorable situación, cerca del hotel se encuentran múltiples supermercados, tiendas y una parada de metro a no más de 2 minutos andando. También se encuentra muy cerca de la famosa calle Oxford Street. Además, un aplauso grande a todo el personal, que mostraron la cortesía y gen ingles desde el primer momento. En especial, al camarero del bar Jonathan, y a Simona y todas las camareras del restaurante que nos sirvieron y nos atendieron durante toda la estancia. Los únicos dos contras que pudimos encontrar, es la ausencia de desayuno caliente dentro del servicio que ofrecen de buffet como también la ausencia de algún canal de televisión en español. Por todo lo demás, es un hotel 100% recomendable.",5,2014,01,25
115,Veramente un bell'albergo nel cuore di Londra,"E' veramente un bell'albergo. Nel cuore di Londra attaccato a Tottenham Court Road e al British Museum.
Edificio del primi del '900 ottimamente restaurato. Le camere non sono enormi, ma molto ben arredate e bagno confortevole.
Ottimo servizio ed estrema gentilezza.
Unici punti negativi sono la colazione un pò misera (sia la parte dolce sia la parte salata) ed il soffione della doccia mezzo incrostato e quindi con un flusso d'acqua non all'altezza.
Ci tornerei volentieri.",5,2014,01,25
115,Ottima posizione e bell'atmosfera,"Un hotel di medie dimensioni,  che si lascia apprezzare per la piacevole atmosfera e soprattutto per l'ottima posizione, a pochi passi dal British Museum, dallo shopping di Oxford Street, dai teatri e dai locali di Leicester Square e Piccadilly. Inoltre la fermata della metro è proprio dietro l'angolo.  Sollecito e disponibile il personale addetto a reception e concierge. Camera dalle dimensioni piuttosto contenute, ma comunque comoda e ben equipaggiata. Nel complesso da consigliare per il buon rapporto qualità-prezzo, tenuto conto che si tratta del cuore di Londra.",4,2014,01,24
115,Perfect Location,"Wir verbrachten 4 Tage in diesem Londoner Hotel, insgesamt ist das Hotel gut, die Lage ist perfeckt und der ganz grosse Vorteil dieses typischen Englischen Hotels.
Weniger gut war die Lage des Zimmers leider war die Aussicht so wie der lärm gegenüber eines Bürogebäudes nicht dem Niveau angespasst.
Frühstück ist ok nicht top aber auch nicht schlecht.
Das Hotel kann ich empgehlen wegen der schönen Lage.
Enjoy",4,2014,01,11
115,elegantes Hotel,"Ein sehr angenehmes Hotel mit sehr freundlichem Service und sehr komfortablen Zimmern. Check In war sehr angenehm und freundlich. Die Lage ist sehr gut. Leider liegen Bar und Frühstücksraum im Keller, daher etwas dunkel. Allerdings gibt es auch eine Terrasse.",5,2013,12,23
115,ottimo hotel,"sono stato in questo hotel e devo dire che sono rimasto soddisfatto. Carina la location, ottima posizione, personale gentile ed ottimi servizi. Peccato che la camera era  piccola e cosi' anche il bagno. 
Davvero nulla da dire x il resto.

Consigliato",4,2013,12,02
115,Shhhhhhh.... No lo comenten mucho!!!,"Sino,  estará más caro y llenó la próxima visita....
La ubicación es perfecta para moverte por Londres sin casi necesitar el metro , bus o la Oyster card. A 5 min. de Covent Garden y el Soho, lugar de marcha nocturna. Bien conectado con todos los servicios de transporte.
El hotel es clásico por fuera y dentro tiene un estilo más moderno pero sin dejar de sér clásico y lujoso, fue renovado hace cuatro años y el estado en gral. es impecable! 
. La bienvenida fue rápida y amable. Gracias a la recepción especialmente a Mikel por tantos detalles, habla español y es muy amable .la habitación que nos asignaron era bastante grande y luminosa, con un mueble con set de te y cafetera de Nespresso gratis! El baño pequeño pero con bañera y todos los amenities disponibles, La cama king súper grande y cómoda. Tv pantalla plana, plancha , Safe y hasta paraguas había.
El desayuno vale las 15 libras, un pequeño bufete tiene todo lo necesario para un buen comienzo del día. 
El restaurante no lo disfrutamos ya que preferimos comer fuera. Pero el bar del subsuelo era perfecto  para un cóctel o una copa,  antes o después d la cena.
El Personal es muy profesional y dispuestos a ayudarte siempre. Gracias por el cava que nos enviaron por el cumpleaños de mi esposa! Un detalle inolvidable....
Lo recomiendo y volveremos nuestra próxima visita a Londres !",5,2013,11,25
115,Ottimo per un we lungo,"Ottima la posizione, a pochi metri dal british museum, si possono raggiungere a piedi molte delle principali attrazioni della city. Personale cordiale e disponibile.

115,Ottima scelta!!!,Abbiamo soggiornato per due notti durante un viaggio di lavoro. Ottima la posizione molto centrale e a due passi dal British Museum. Le Camere sono spaziose e molto ben curate.

Das Hotel liegt zentral, die Zimmer sind sauber und das ganze Hotel macht einen gepflegten Eindruck.",4,2013,10,23
115,"super Hotel, super Lage, toller Service","dieses Hotel überzeugt in allen Punkten.
Es liegt sehr nahe an der Shopping-Meile. Der Empfang beim Check in ist sehr freundlich und aufmerksam. Es gibt gleich Tee, Kaffee, Limonade. Der Consierge kümmert sich sehr zuvorkommend ums Gepäck. Die Zimmer sind sehr schön, modern, aber halt etwas dunkel. Es ist sehr sauber im ganzen Zimmer, es gibt auch eine Kaffeemaschine und Tee in jedem Zimmer.
Das Frühstück ist sehr gut, mit recht grosser Auswahl, das Personal ist sehr höflich und hilfsbereit. In der Bar ist es Abends sehr angenehm, um noch einen Drink zu nehmen. 
Wellness haben wir nicht genutzt und auch nicht im Restaurant gegessen.Wer mit einem Auto anreist sollte beachten, dass das Hotel kein Parking hat. Wenige Meter neben dem Hotel hat es ein öffentliches Parking. Hier ist einfach zu beachten, dass das gesamte Parkhaus extrem eng ist und nur für Kleinwagen optimal geeignet ist. Grössere Autos müssen hier mit sehr viel Geschick manövriert werden, es geht hier um Zentimeterarbeit.",5,2013,10,07
115,Para recomendar,"Regresamos al Bloomsbury luego de 2 años y nuestra estancia fue aun mejor que la anterior. Excelente ubicación para recorrer Londres  caminando. Cerca de todo. Habitaciones amplias y confortables con cafetera Nespresso  y tetera . Desayuno completisimo . El personal amable y servicial. Varios hablan español.Mención aparte merecen la calidez y atenciones recibidas de Mikel Alvarez, Guest Relations Manager quien no dudó en quedarse después de su horario para dejarnos instalados en una habitación a nuestro gusto  y aun tener la atención de ubicarnos al final de nuestra estadía  en una suite como broche a una excelente visita. Sin duda volveremos en nuestro proximo viaje a Londres   .",5,2013,10,01
115,Reconfortante,"Excelente ubicación para movilizarse en una ciudad como Londres, la atención de todo el personal (algunos de ellos Louise, Bruno, Irina, Alina, Jonathan, etc) fue estupenda, limpieza y servicios correctos para llegar después de todo el día de recorrida . El perfume en todo el hotel es inolvidable, con velas y aromatizadores en hall de entrada y pasillos. Desayuno completísimo. Bar para disfrutarlo. Wi fi: funciona! Personal que habla español. Todos colaboran para la respuesta a cualquier pregunta que se haga. Tuvieron la atención de un presente por mi cumpleaños. Pasillos silenciosos. Ascensores que funcionan. Diarios en el lobby. En fin, fue importantísimo para nuestra perecta estadía en Londres. Sin dudarlo lo recomendaremos y volveremos.",5,2013,09,16
115,Espectacular,"Un excelente hotel. Muy buenas habitaciones, un bar magnífico abierto las 24 horas, buen restaurante y todos los servicios para una estancia placentera. Para los que no manejan bien el inglés en el restaurante hay una persona, Alina, que además de ser muy amable habla perfectamente español. Lo mismo ocurre con el personal de recepción.... todos muy amables. Finalmente una ubicación perfecta.... a pasos del Museo Británico y cerca de todos los puntos de interés turístico.",5,2013,09,08
115,Hotel muy acogedor!!!!,"Es un hotel muy bien situado en pleno centro de Londres cerca de todo los teatros. Muy recomendable.Habitaticions super amplias. Los teatros y Museos a 5 minutos andando.
Restaurantes de todo tipos muy cerca.",5,2013,09,06
115,"Hotel acogedor y céntrico, cerca del Soho","Se trata de un tradicional edificio de ladrillo estilo neogeorgiano. Pertenece a The Doyle Collection, lo que es una garantía. Está muy bien ubicado para llegar andando a los teatros, al Covent Garden, el Museo Británico, la National Gallery, Trafalgar Square, Charing Cross Road, etc.
La recepcionista, que hablaba español, nos entregó al llegar unas toallitas refrescantes y también la tarjeta magnética y nos dijo cuál era nuestra habitación. Un conserje muy amable nos acompañó en el ascensor y nos subió las maletas. La habitación estaba muy bien decorada y era tal y como esperábamos. Resultaba acogedora y cómoda, además de que era lo suficientemente grande para dos personas, cosa bastante rara en muchos hoteles de Londres. Daba a la fachada principal a través de dos ventanales. Tenía además una kettle para preparar un café o una infusión, leche en polvo, azúcar, edulcorante y unas galletitas, ya que esto es muy común en los hoteles ingleses y todo lo renovaban a diario, al igual que las amenities del cuarto de baño, que eran buenas y completas y olían muy bien.
La cama era sumamente cómoda y se dormía divinamente porque no se oía ni un solo ruido.
El hotel está recientemente reformado por lo que la decoración es muy actual. Tiene una pequeña terraza con plantas en el lateral a la que dan el comedor de desayunos y el restaurante.
A la hora de desayunar, se tenía que pedir primeramente mesa al jefe de comedor y él o ella, según quien te tocara, te indicaba dónde sentarte. Siempre nos sentamos en el mismo sitio, era como si tuviéramos reservada la mesa. El salón donde se servía era muy agradable. Estaba situado en el semisótano, junto a la salida lateral del hotel. Aunque aún era temprano había ya bastante gente desayunando a esas horas. El buffet estaba compuesto de una gran cantidad de alimentos expuestos en una mesa grande redonda en el centro de otra sala de la que se podía elegir de todo, al gusto de cada cual y, a mayores, se podía pedir también un desayuno caliente a la inglesa preparado en la cocina al momento. Probamos de todo. Yo, cada día me pedí una selección distinta de entre salchichas, morcilla, huevos revueltos, en tortilla o pasados por agua, setas, beicon frito, gachas, tortitas, etc. Para beber, se podía elegir entre té, infusiones, café o cacao y el zumo de naranja era natural. Los camareros eran eficientes y muy elegantes ya que todos vestían traje y corbata, como los recepcionistas. El desayuno resultaba fantástico.
En fin, que la estancia en el hotel resultó muy agradable. El servicio era muy profesional y atento. Siempre dispuesto a ayudar.",4,2013,09,05
115,"Ottima posizione, consigliato anche ai celiaci.","Hotel accogliente e in posizione strategica, eravamo in quattro persone in due camere superior,  peccato che quelle assegnate a noi erano un po piccole e con un problema al lavandino che faceva defluire l'acqua nello scarico moooolto lentamente, in compenso una pulizia impeccabile. Personale gentilissimo e disponibilissimo sia al Ricevimento che al Concierge e soprattutto il personale del ristorante per la prima colazione, che nonostante non parlassimo bene l'inglese, si è adoperato in tutto e si è sforzato di comprenderci e accontentarci, hotel attrezzato anche per chi come mia figlia è celiaco, bravi e grazie di tutto, ci rivedremo sicuramente.",5,2013,09,03
115,Hotel molto confortevole e in ottima posizione,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel molto carino e devo dire che le mie attese non sono state tradite. Le parti comuni dell'albergo sono molto curate e comode, il personale è gentile, la camera che mi era stata assegnata (una superior queen) molto confortevole, silenziosa e anche spaziosa, con tutti i possibili confort. Il bagno comodo e di grandi dimensioni, un'ottima accoglienza con cioccolatini serali! La posizione dell'hotel è ideale, a pochi passi dal British, da Covent Garden, National Gallery ecc. e subito alle spalle della fermata di Tottenham Court Road della metro e da Oxford Street, quindi un punto di partenza ideale per girare sia a piedi sia coi mezzi.
Room service (provato!) ottimo e 24 ore su 24. Molto buona anche la colazione, con personale gentilissimo e disponibile. 
L'unico appunto, la pulizia della stanza non al 100%, ma comunque a uno standard più che accettabile.
Da consigliare.",4,2013,09,01
115,Consigliatissimo,"Ottimo hotel!Abbiamo soggiornato a Londra diverse volte, sempre in hotel a 4 stelle e il Bloomsbury e'sicuramente il migliore. Camere spaziose (e a Londra non e'facile trovare hotel con camere ampie) silenziose e molto pulite: le lenzuola venivano cambiate ogni giorno. Non avevamo la colazione compresa, ma in camera si trova tutto il necessario: macchina caffe' Nespresso, bollitore per il te' con bustine e biscotti acqua minerale, tutto compreso nel prezzo della camera, solo il minibar e'a pagamento.La posizione e'eccellente, si possono raggiungere anche a piedi le principali aree di interesse di Londra e a due minuti c'e' la fermata metro di Tottenham court road.Molto comodo anche il bus. Personale molto cordiale e disponibile.Consigliatissimo.Londra e'sempre splendida.",5,2013,08,25
115,Posizione eccellente,"Posizione eccellente per raggiungere qualsiasi punto di Londra. Camere confortevoli.  Ottima colazione e cena.
Unico suggerimento al personale del front desk: molto efficienti ma un sorriso in più non guasterebbe.  Lo staff del ristorante a colazione è eccezionale.  Molto cordiali anche quelli della cena.
Ma il top della simpatia, cortesia ed efficienza sono i ragazzi della concierge.",5,2013,08,22
115,"Ottimo hotel, ottima posizione","Il Bloomsbury Hotel è un quattro stelle a tutti gli effetti: camere spaziose, letto comodo, armadio, phon, poltrona, scrivania, macchina caffè Nespresso con cialde gratuite, bollitore acqua con infusi gratis e biscotti. C'è anche il minibar, ovviamente a pagamento. In bagno c'è tutto il necessario ed è tutto molto pulito. 
Gli spazi comuni sono eleganti e arredati con gusto, lo staff è gentile. 
L'hotel si trova a un minuto a piedi dalla metro Tottenham  Court (Central Line) e si arriva a piedi a Oxford Street, Soho e Piccadilly (10 minuti ).
Caro, ma giusto. Consigliatissimo.",5,2013,08,14
115,Top Hotel!,"Das Hotel liegt an zentraler Lage und überzeugte uns komplett! Der Service ist diskret und zuvorkommend. Die Zimmer sind modern eingerichtet, mit Nespresso-Maschine, Gebäck etc. Zudem verfügt das Hotel über ein nettes Restaurant mit gemütlicher Bar. Auch das Fitnessstudio wird allen Ansprüchen gerecht. Neben dem Hotel liegt gleich eine tubestation. In allem einsehr schönes 4* Hotel!",5,2013,07,05
115,Mas que buenas instalaciones. MUY BUENA GENTE,"Buena habitación, servicios, desayunos. Excelente ubicación. Por sobre todo eso,  la atención del personal del hotel, sea cual fuere su puesto, SUPERLATIVA. Todos se preocuparon por hacer nuestra estadía , no sólo en su hotel, sino en Londres, verdaderamente inolvidable. Por nombrar algunos de ellos, el señor RODY MC GRATH, a quien prometemos visitar Irlanda, y a la señorita Andreia, a quien tuvimos muy presente al pasar por FATIMA. Gracias a todos. Nos volveremos a ver.

115,Luxus an bester Lage,"Am Wochenende the Championsleague Finale im Wembley gab es sehr wenig Zimmer in London. Nach langer Suche fanden wir ein Zimmer in Bloomsburry zu 238 £ (279 £ mit Taxen).
Wir kammen schon morgen frueh um 10 Uhr und bekammen auch promt unser Zimmer. 
Das Zimmer zum Innenhof war sehr ruhig. Ausgestattet mit allen modernen Annehmelichkeiten (IPhone/IPod Musik base), free WIFI, minibar etc.
Das Bett super komfortabel, Einrichtung sehr, sehr sorgfaelltig ausgewaehlt und farbenmaessig suberb abgestimmt. letzteres stimmt auch fuer die gesammte Einrichtung des Hotels.
Die Lage ist unschlagbar: Metro sowie Dutzende Bus Linien sind innert wenigen Minuten vom Hotel entfernt. Shopping lohnt sich ebenfalls gleich aus dem Hotel findet man die New Oxford Street.
Wir haben nicht im Hotel gegessen (so viele Moeglichkeiten in der Naehe ...). Zum Fruehstueck hatte es leider auch nicht gereicht, da wir sehr frueh abreisen mussten.
Ende Juni werde ich zwei Tage in London sein und wieder zum Bloomsburry gehen.",5,2013,06,02
115,Da Consigliare,"Hotel di stile classico a due passi da Oxford Street e quindi comodissimo per raggiungere a piedi i principali punti di interesse, camere spaziose di design. Servizio efficiente. Ci sono stato in due occasioni e il servizio è sempre stato al top.",5,2013,05,29
115,Exclusives Hotel im Herzen von London,"Wir waren für 4 Tage im Bloomsbury. Das aller beste ist die Lage des Hotels. In nur 1.5 min. haben sie Restaurants, Ubahn, Starbucks, Shopping (großer Primark direkt beim Hotel) und urige Pubs wo sie sich bei einem kühlen Guinness erholen können. Das Hotel ist natürlich auch einfach spitze, wir hatten ein Zimmer zum Innenhof welches sehr ruhig war. Die Ausstattung ist hochwertig, wie es sich für ein Hotel dieser Klasse gehört. Das einzige was ich bemängeln kann wäre die Matratze welche sehr weich war. Ansonsten kann ich das Hotel absolut weiterempfehlen. Beim nächsten London-Trip werde ich sicher wieder das Bloomsbury buchen.",5,2013,05,04
115,Top service,"Gerade das empfangspersonal, insbesondere Brian, war sehr freundlich und wirklich stets bemueht, zu helfen. So z. B bei der Suche nach einem Parkplatz fuer die gesamten 6 Tage oder die Restaurantempfehlungen passten genau.. Auch de Manager war äußerst zuvorkommend. Wir haben dort u. A . Meinen Geburtstag gefeiert und alle waren wirklich von Herzen nett, nichts aufgesetztes. Allerdings sind die Standardraeume recht klein , datier ist die Lage top. ",4,2013,04,25
115,"ruhig gelegen, schöne ausstattung, freundliches personal, mängel bei den details","das bloomsbury liegt sehr zentral und trotzdem ruhig, die wichtigsten sehenswürdigkeiten sind problemlos erreichbar, nächste tube station in 5 minuten. 
das hotel ist stilvoll eingerichtet, die besseren Zimmer, die ihren preis haben, sind gross und stylish, die badezimmer sind grandios.
das personal ist äusserst zuvorkommend, und versucht alle wünsche zu erfüllen, wunderbar!

das englische frühstück war am ersten tag enttäuschend: qualitativ schlechte produkte, keine richtigen eier fürs Rührei sondern fertigei, vor fett triefende gummige Würstchen, matschiger kartoffelkuchen, gummiger Speck, alles vorbereitet und wohl seid stunden am rumliegen in der Küche - entspricht nicht dem sonstigen standard des hotels. auf unsere reklamation hin wurden wir auf einen cocktail an der bar eingeladen. das nächste frühstück war besser, allerdings faule erdbeeren auf der ansonsten feinen Waffel. offenbar hat die frühstücksküche die details nicht im griff, schade. gleich beim hotel gibts wunderbare frühstücksalternativen und dazu noch viel günstiger!
generell kommen die details zu kurz: hinter der tür in der toilette wird nicht gewischt, die glänzenden dispenser sind staubig (und das sieht man halt eben weil glänzend), die aufhängung der storen im bad sind nur eingelegt, die store erschlägt einem wenn man sie aufziehen möchte, der teppich ist fusselig usw. deshalb für das was das hotel will und was es kostet: nur ein befriedigend in der totalwertung.",3,2013,04,20
115,Molto bello!,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel per una settimana a febbraio e l'esperienza è stata molto buona! La hall (che ha un profumo delizioso) e le aree comuni sono belle ed accoglienti e il personale molto gentile (soprattutto i ragazzi all'entrata!). Avendo letto nelle rcensioni che le stanze erano belle ma un po' piccole e dovendo fermarmi per 5 notti, mi sono concessa per una volta un upgrade alla stanza superior e ho fatto bene! Camera molto bella, dimensioni ideali, letto comodissimo e macchina Nespresso inclusa. Unico piccolo neo: il bagno un po' sacrificato. Notizia per chi come me ha ahimé il vizio del fumo: tutto l'hotel è non fumatori. Ma in compenso al piano terra c'è un delizioso terrazzo dove ci si può sfogare prima di salire in camera :-). Zona perfetta e nonostante sia in pieno centro molto silenziosa!",4,2013,03,29
115,Ubicación excelente !,"Fuimos con mi familia y pasamos dos semanas. Solicitamos early check in y cuando arribamos no estaban disponibles todas las habitaciones reservadas sin embargo el personal de recepcion (Mickel) nos fue solucionando todos los inconvenientes en forma rapida y eficiente. Las Suites 421 y 521 son excelentes, con buen espacio aunque poco lugar para el guardado de ropa en el caso de una estadia prolongada. El servicio de conserjeria fue excelente. El desayuno muy bueno y completo. Aunque limpio podrian mejorar aun mas ese aspecto sobre todo en la limpieza diaria de las habitaciones. La 516 es una habitacion tambien razonable en terminos de espacio pero en nuestro caso la utilizo solo una persona  No utilizamos el restaurante por lo que no puedo emitir opinion aunque vale destacar que la calidad del desayuno y del servicio al cuarto indicarian que podria ser bueno. Los baños estan bien equipados y los amenities razonables aunque la presion del agua caliente es un poco baja. El personal de recepcion, conserjeria, botones y desayuno fueron muy atentos. El Hotel es muy recomendable por su ubicacion ( a solo dos cuadras de la estacion del Underground Tottenham Court Road, a dos cuadras del
museo Britanico y a pasos de la Oxford Street y los puntos con mas movimiento de la ciudad) y el precio para Londres es razonable. Recomendable !!!",4,2013,03,21
115,Excelente ubicación y muy buena atención.,"Hace poco regresamos de Londres y nos alojamos en el Bloomsbury Hotel por varios días. La verdad el servicio fue excelente y las habitaciones eran bastante cómodas y muy lindas. El desayuno es completo y tiene un buen horario. En líneas generales el hotel es muy bueno y altamente recomendable, sobre todo, por su excelente ubicación (situado a 5 minutos a pie del Soho, del British museum y de la estación de subte Tottenham Court Road, y a unas pocas cuadras de Oxford Street). 
Concluyendo se puede decir que el Bloomsbury es un hotel con un gran servicio, pero una enorme ventaja por sobre la mayoría de los hoteles, su increíble ubicación que permite ir caminando a algunos de los mejores lugares de Londres sin problema alguno.",4,2013,03,20
115,amo londra,"Ottimo albergo, ristrutturato con eleganza, in posizione ottima e ben servito dai mezzi pubblici, ma tuttavia estremamente silenzioso. Il personale e' gentilissimo, molto collaborativo e le camere sono dotate di numerosi comfort, compreso l' accesso gratis a Internet. Il servizio per la prima colazione e' molto accurato; non so se la colazione sia da considerarsi cara, perche' avevamo un trattamento di bed and breakfast, e la scelta e' comunque varia e completa. La camera non era molto grande, ma in compenso lo era il bagno, dotato di vasca con doccia, con molto spazio a disposizione per appoggiare gli articoli da toilette. Il prezzo e' equo, considerando la posizione centrale e il livello generale dell' Hotel. Essendo andati molte volte a Londra, possiamo confrontare con molte altre sistemazioni e troviamo questa decisamente una delle migliori di nostra esperienza.",5,2013,03,17
115,fantastico hotel perfetto per il british museum,"se desideri visitare il british museum questo hotel è a 100mt ed è vicinissimo alla rete metropolitana.
le stanze pulite ed eleganti, il personale capace e bravo, molto giovanile nonostante il puro old british dell'ambiete.
la colazione costosissima, da evitare, vicino ci sono due tre locali per la colazione.
sono rimasto soddisfatto.
ciao",4,2013,03,11
115,Da consigliare,"Ho alloggiato 5 notti nella stanza 204.
Bellissimo hotel,parti comuni molto spaziose ed arredate con grande gusto.
Personale molto cordiale ed orientato al cliente. Viene offerta la possibilita' di scegliere se pagare in euro o sterline.
Posizione ottima,davvero centrale a pochi passi dalla metro Totthenam Court Road e da moltissimi bus.
Camera arredata con gusto, letto con materasso comodo.In camera sono disponibili: tv a schermo piatto, cassetta di sicurezza (gratuita), frigobar (a pagamento), the,acqua naturale,caffe' solubile e biscotti (gratuitamente),phon,ferro da stiro con relativa asse e persino l'ombrello in caso di pioggia.

Il bagno e' dotato di vasca con doccia,wc,lavabo e sono disponibili diversi prodotti (bagnoschiuma,shampoo,cotone).Cambio asciugamani giornaliero. All'arrivo si trovano anche gli accapatoi con le ciabattine.
Le dimensioni del bagno sono confortevoli,mentre la stanza e' un po' piccola.Molto buono il livello di pulizia complessivo.
Viene servita la colazione per 18 sterline a persona,non ne abbiamo pero' usufruito vista la centralita' della zona e la possibilita' di scegliere tra numerosi bar a pochi passi.
Wi-fi facilmente accessibile e ben funzionante.In conclusione,un ottimo hotel.",4,2013,03,07
115,tolles Hotel an sehr guter Lage,"Zentral gelegen aber trotzdem angenehm ruhig. Sehr freundliches Personal, nette Ecke in der Lobby mit Wasser, Tee und Früchten. Gutes Frühstück. Im Zimmer wurde immer wieder Mineralwasser aufgetischt und Nespresso-Kapseln nachgefüllt.",5,2013,03,05
115,ho soggiornato varie volte,"per motivi di lavoro sono stata varie volte al Bloomsbury, le camere sono pulite e confortevoli, la posizione è centrale e le colazioni, (anche se come si sa non sono quasi mai incluse nel pernottamento), sono abbondanti e con tanta scelta. Cibi freschi.
Mi piace lo stile, dagli arredamenti alle amenities, incluso l'accappatoio morbido e tutto l'occorrente che si trova a disposizione nel bagno. Adoro questo albergo, altri alberghi a londra in cui sono stata, non hanno la stessa pulizia e decoro, tutto sommato il prezzo del pernottamento non è alto per un albergo al centro di londra",4,2013,01,31
115,ottimo!!!,"Siamo stati al The Bloomsbury in occasione delle feste di Capodanno, e devo dire che ci siamo trovati ottimamente!L' hotel è molto centrale, quasi di fronte al British Museum, e a pochi minuti a piedi da Oxford Street. Nella zona si trovano negozi, ristoranti, teatri, pub, e di tutto e di più...Ma passiamo alla recensione vera e propria della struttura :) All' arrivo siamo stati accolti da una gentilissima signorina alla reception che ci ha offerto una salvietta calda (pioveva) e ci ha spiegato tutti gli orari di colazione, ecc...Le valigie ci sono state portate in camera da un addetto, e finalmente ci siamo accomodati dopo ore di viaggio tra aereo/treno/metro. In camera abbiamo trovato a disposizione un vassoio con acqua fresca, bollitore, tisane, biscotti, caffè che ogni giorno ci veniva riassortito (il tutto compreso in quel che avevamo pagato). Bella stanza, leggermente piccola ma perfetta in ogni dettaglio, pulizia top. Bagno un po' piccolino, ma perfettamente funzionale...Ci poteva stare considerato il resto...Bisogna fare una lode al personale che è stato gentilissimo e disponibile a rispondere a tutti i nostri quesiti su trasporti/eventi nelle vicinanze e quant' altro...Colazione continentale molto abbondante e variegata con frutta fresca, salumi, pesce, torte salate, e pagando in più si poteva richiedere anche quella inglese a parte. Che dire, siamo rimasti pienamente soddisfatti della scelta fatta e ci torneremmo volentieri (magari con una camera un pochino più grande).",5,2013,01,07
115,Continua siendo perfecto,"Acabamos de regresar de un fin de semana en Londres y después de un año y medio escogimos alojarnos de nuevo en el Bloomsbury. El hotel no defraudó. Es un hotel acogedor con servicio excelente. 

Esta vez nos tocó una habitación relativamente pequeña pero tampoco estuvimos casi en ella así que no nos importó.

El hotel tiene una localización perfecta a un minuto a pie de miles de bares y restaurantes pero a la vez en una calle super tranquila, la misma calle que el British Museum. El hotel no es barato pero comparado con el resto de hoteles de la zona, calidad precio está muy bien.",5,2012,12,10
115,Zentral eingebettet zwischen British Museum und Oxford Street,"Schönes historisches Stadthotel, technisch auf dem neuesten Stand mit gratis WIFI im ganzen Hotel. Sehr freundliches und hilfsbereites Personal, die Zimmer sind in dieser Preislage im Vergleich zu anderen Häusern relativ großzügig bemessen, sehr sauber und angenehm gestaltet. Auch die sehr zentrale Lage lässt viele Spaziergänge entweder Richtung Oxford Street, British Museum oder Richtung Covent Garden zu. Nächste U-Bahnstation: Tottenham Courtroad (Northern Line). Durch die Nähe zu Soho ist dieses Hotel auch ein guter Ausgangsort für Theater- und Musicalbesuche. Komme gerne wieder!",4,2012,12,09

Tutto  molto bene.",4,2012,11,16
115,Bello!,"Sono stata solo una notte in questo albergo per un impegno di lavoro, ma mi sono trovata molto bene. La posizione è comoda, vicino a Shaftesbury e diciamo circa 5/7 minuti a piedi da Soho e Covent Garden. La camera che avevo era molto bella, curatissima in tutti i dettagli, molto ben arredata.

115,CUIDADO CON LAS HABITACIONES EN PISOS ALTOS,"Nos alojamos en este hotel hace unas semanas. Nos asignaron una habitación en un piso alto, que resultó estar abuhardillada y sin luz exterior. Solicitamos un cambio y al dia siguiente pudimos alojarnos en una habitación correcta en un piso intermedio. El hotel esta magníficamente situado, a cinco minutos a pie del Soho, 10 de Covent Garden y a un paso del Museo Británico. La zona comercial de Oxford Street, Regent Street y New Bond Street también están cerca. El lobby del hotel es algo decadente. El personal de reservas quiza algo inexperto. A este nivel el hotel debería mejorar. Por lo demás, muy buen hotel, pero no es barato.",4,2012,10,28
115,Buon hotel,"Non diamo il voto più alto a causa di camera e bagno, un po' piccoli; tra l'altro l'appunto é già stato fatto da altri utenti. A parte ciò, bisogna rimarcare l'ottima pulizia (con cambi di asciugamani anche in serata). L'albergo é a un minuto dalla stazione del metro di Tottenham Road Court; da lì, poi, ci sono coincidenza per ogni dove. A piedi si raggiunge Piccadilly Circus in quindici minuti al massimo per cui la struttura può definirsi molto centrale. Bloomsbury é ubicato su una laterale di Oxford Street, ma alla sera il traffico cala quasi completamente per cui si trova in una zona molto tranquilla. Siamo strati contenti.",4,2012,10,15
115,Hotel perfecto para visitar el Museo Británico,"Estuvimos en el mes de agosto de 2012, el hotel está a 4 minutos de la entrada al Museo, en un barrio tranquilo, pero próximo al metro y a muchos autobuses, tiendas y cafeterías. Desayuno correcto; Las habitaciones tienen lo necesario, y son cómodas, no se oyen ruidos, a pesar de la proximidad de un pub y de la calle principal; el baño tiene una mala distribución, por lo que resulta algo pequeño. Personal muy amable, hablan español. Es recomendable si se quiere estar próximo a la zona del museo, Picadilly, Soho. Londres es muy grande y hay varias buenas ubicaciones para un hotel, no se puede estar cerca de todo, pero desde este se puede recorrer casi toda la ciudad andando.",4,2012,10,08
115,Reune todo lo que priorizo para elegir un hotel,"A la hora de escoger un hotel considero 4 factores fundamentales: localización, higiene, confort y servicio...
Localización inmejorable, cercano a muchos puntos de interés turístico (para llegar caminando si mucha exigencia) a pocas cuadras de Picadilly Circus, con una perfecta ubicación del Metro para trasladarte a lugares más distantes, y como broche, en un barrio muy tranquilo.
Una correcta limpieza tanto en áreas comunes, como la habitación.
Las camas son muy confortables, el tamaño de la habitación correcto, el baño nuevo e impecable, con todos los productos de tocador; también ofrece te y cafe free. Un solo detalle llamativo, el secador de cabello no puede conectarse en el baño porque el enchufe no está adaptado al aparato.
el servicio también es muy bueno, llegamos muy temprano y nos permitieron hacer el check in sin inconvenientes. No dudaría en volver si regreso a Londres.",4,2012,09,28

115,Ottimo,"Ottimo hotel di classe, situato in una posizione invidiabile nel centro di Londra, a pochi passi dal Dominion Theatre e dal British Museum, tanto per citare due mete molto note e molto ambite dai visitatori. Per non parlare poi di Oxford Street a due passi, chilometri di shopping di qualità, dove è possibile trovare di tutto. La metropolitana è a 1 minuto di cammino a piedi. 
Le camere sono ben arredate, silenziose, dotate di ogni comfort. Ottima la prima colazione, abbondante e molto varia, per tutti i gusti e per tutte le necessità.Con un supplemento non eccessivo si possono ordinare le preparazioni calde tipiche del Full English Breakfast.",5,2012,05,28

115,"Non sono rimasta contenta,e dire che avevo letto recensioni soddisfacenti!","Avevo colto al volo un'offerta su easytobook che era allettante pertanto spendendo milletrecentoventuno euro Con un prepagato non rimborsabile,ho acqiustato una tripla per 4 giorni di maggio 2012.Amo stare comoda e scelgo sempre con cura gli hotels che mi ospitano,sono stata quindi scrupolosa nella scelta che poi alla fine si è rivelata deludente.Avevo chiesto ad una signorina di easytobook che mi  rispondeva col numero verde direttamente da Amsterdam (loro sede) garanzie in merito alla tipologia della camera e a costo di apparire pignola ed insistente ho chiesto che venisse specificata la presenza di 3 persone e la grandezza della stanza.Sono stata accontentata ed ho portato con me la prenotazione che con chiarezza specificava tripla 28 mq.,con l'assicurazione da parte della operatrice di easytobook che in caso di problemi avrei potuto contattarli in qualsiasi momento(cosa che ho fatto ma senza ricevere risposta).Giunta in albergo di sera,ho dovuto salire dei gradini che sono all'ingresso con delle valigie poichè non c'era nessuno,poi alla reception,un solo impiegato per nulla poliglotta,mi ha assegnato una camera indicandomi l'ascensore......la stanza ovviamente non era per tre persone,era una doppia standard e non certo di 28 mq per cui era impensabile per me poter accettare l'offerta di un letto aggiunto.Dopo una trafila di incomprensioni ho detto in inglese maccheronico che sarei andata via e che poi avrei fatto le mie rimostranze con easytobook poichè non era quella la camera prenotata da me a fronte di quella spesa peraltro anticipata.A quel punto dopo avermi fatta accomodare in un salottino,dopo un pò mi è stata assegnata un quadrupla,spaziosa ed accogliente che ho accettato al volo perchè stanca,avvilita ( avevo tentato inutilmente di contattare easytobook al numero di rete fissa)  stavo pensando di aver preso una (cantonata).La camera poi si è rivelata con qualche problema,ma per come si era presentata la situazione dico che mi è andata bene. Allora comincio col dire che la camera buia aveva 2 finestre al piano terra (anche se in ascensore bisognava pigiare 1 piano)che davano su un cortile interno molto piccolo con visuale ridotta per la presenza di un muro ,di notte il rumore della pioggia che rimbalzava su una grata era molto fastidioso.Al mattino non si capiva guardando dai vetri che tempo faceva fuori,mentre dentro la camera il sistema di aria condizionata era rumoroso tanto da costringermi a tenerlo spento.Il bagno aveva rubinetti che emettevano un sibilo quando si apriva l'acqua calda,al mio arrivo ho poggiato la mia borsa su una consolle col ripiano in marmo senza accorgermi che il ripiano era sporco ed appiccicoso.Moquette e tendaggi datati ed assenza di frigorifero sono carenze degne di nota,esisteva un frigobar di quelli che puoi solo prendere e non aggiungere.In compenso veniva fornita gratuitamente l'acqua il giornale i prodotti da bagno ,nonchè accappatoio e ciabatte ma questo lo sapevo già poichè ben specificato su internet,come pure sapevo bene di avere scelto una zona buona centrale vicina alla metro nonchè ad un famoso teatro.A disposizione insieme al set per preparare il thè c'erano buoni biscotti ,ma io avevo comunque fatto attenzione alle recensioni e sapevo che di fronte c'era un bar italiano e a 2 passi un supermercato aperto fino a tardi moltol fornito e con buoni prezzi.Non ho fatto uso di ristorante nè di spa pertanto in albergo sono rimasta solo per dormire e non posso quindi esprimere giudizi in merito alla risorazione ed altro.Certamente l'impatto iniziale problematico ha inficiato tutto il soggiorno e non credo che vi tornerò in un prossimo viaggio.",3,2012,05,20
115,molto confortevole,"L'hotel è molto curato, pulito e  tranquillo.   Le camere spaziose con tutti i confort, il bagno pulito tutto perfettamente arredato.Il personale è gentile, ma non parla italiano.

115,Un magnifico hotel,"Estuvimos con mi marido durante ocho dias en agosto y nuestra estancia fue perfecta. El hotel tiene una decoracion elegante y muy bonita en todas sus instalaciones. Las habitaciones no son muy grandes pero su tamaño es suficiente, la decoracion esta al minimo detalle y limpias. La cama es grande y muy comoda al igual q las almohadas. En cuanto al desayuno nosotros teniamos desayuno ingles q era de lo mas completo y bueno ademas habia un bufet de cosas frias tambien muy bueno. El comedor era grande asi fueras cuando fueras almorzar siempre tenias sitio. La zona donde esta el hotel es buena porque es tranquila teniendo el museo Britanico a la vuelta de la esquina y teniendo una de las  zonas tipicas de restaurantes y bares de londres a 10 minutos andando. El personal fue correcto siempre con nosotros. Asi q nuestra estancia fue genial y sin duda cuando vuelva me alojare alli.",5,2012,03,28
115,Una notte e via,"Struttura confortevole, strada tranquilla, sufficientemente pulita per gli standard anglosassoni. Personale gentile e accogliente anche se non sempre competent.

115,Gutes Hotel in guter Lage in London,"Für 4 Tage habe ich für eine Geschäftsreise im Bloomsbury Hotel übernachtet. Für das Hotel spricht die super gute Lage. Klasse gelegen an der Tottenham Court Rd Station ist man schnell überall oder auch zu Fuß schnell auf der Oxford Street. Der Service des Concierge war super- Guter Service nachdem ich leider mein Zimmer noch nicht beziehen konnte, wurde mir der Barbereich geöffnet, damit ich dort noch etwas arbeiten konnte. Leider gäb es keinen Business Center Bereich in dem ich mich zurückziehen konnte. Das Frühstück ist gut und ist etwas ermässigt, wenn es bereits am Vortag gebucht wird. Allerdings kann man auch gegenüber vom Hotel in einem kleinem Café frühstücken (zum halben Preis). Die Zimmer sind ordentlich ausgestattet und nicht ganz so klein, wie es manchmal in London der Fall ist.",4,2012,03,04
115,"Elegante, cómodo y buenas instalaciones","Comparado con otros hoteles tanto cercanos como situados en otras zonas de Londres, este desde luego supera las expectativas. No es barato, pero personalmente creo que mereció la pena cada euro pagado por la estancia: habitación muy amplia (para esta ciudad, grande de verdad), instalaciones muy limpias y cuidadas hasta el máximo detalle, amabilidad del personal... Hay muchas amenities, un buen secador de pelo en la habitación, y el WI-FI gratuito funciona a las mil maravillas. Los porteros, personal de recepción y de desayuno, de 10. Atentos a todo pero de forma discreta, sin agobiar ni molestar. La cama extremadamente cómoda y la ducha con buena presión de agua. Además tienes zapatillas, albornoz... Por último, el desayuno es muy variado, fresco, y abundante. Sin duda, para repetir si entra en presupuesto.",5,2012,02,20
115,Perfektes Hotel für einen Londontrip!,"Ich habe mit meiner Tochter einige Tage im Jänner in London verbracht und dieses Hotel aufgrund der ausgezeichneten Bewertungen auf tripadvisor ausgewählt; wir wurden nicht enttäuscht. 1, DIE LAGE - perfekt für shoppen und sightseeing, 2 U-Bahnlinien in ca. 200m Entfernung, zahlreiche Busstationen in unmittelbarer Nähe. 2, WOHLFÜHLFAKTOR.: elegantes und unaufdringliches Ambiente, Duftkerzen im Foyer, Internetpoint, kompetentes und sehr freundliches Personal, Checkin und Checkout war in kürzester Zeit erledigt, Frühstück (continental) sehr gut, wunderschöne kleine Hotelbar. 3, DIE ZIMMER - wir hatten ein Standardzimmer, das sehr schön war, das Doppelbett ist allerdings relativ schmal, dafür sehr bequem, blitzsauber, Flat-TV mit drei deutschen TV-Sendern, Klimanalage. Das Fenster kann man nicht öffnen. Jederzeit gerne wieder!",5,2012,02,04
115,Sehr zu empfehlen in London,"Wir haben ein verlängertes Wochenende in London verbracht und in diesem Hotel gewohnt. Wir waren sehr zufrieden, das Zimmer war groß genug, ansprechend eingerichtet, sauber und bequem. Das Bad war nicht riesig, aber ebenfalls sehr gut ausreichend, mit guten Pflegeprodukten. Die Athmosphäre im Hotel war angenehm, ruhig und großzügig. Das Personal war sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend.
Einen kleinen Mißstand gab es allerdings: Die Klimaanlage machte, obwohl sie ausgestellt war, erhebliche Geräusche, leider auch nachts.",4,2012,01,31
115,Trato exquisito y centro puro,"Excelente hotel perfectamente situado en el centro, a dos minutos caminando desde el British Museum. El trato del personal es excelente desde que uno entra hasta que sale. la habitación muy limpia. De hecho pasan por la habitación 2-3 veces al día.
Pero también hubo pequeños fallos que harían el hotel perfecto:
-Ducha templada, se calentaba solo a ratos.
-Ruídos en la habitación de tuberías, máquinas...menos mal que estabamos cansados.
-Cama super blanda con caída hacia el centro.
Mereció la pena.",4,2012,01,17

115,"Hotel ""londinese"" e posizione ottima!","Questo hotel è veramente LONDON! dalla hall..ai corridoi..alle scale! camere non grandissime, come i bagni, ma veramente ben strutturate! la camera era fornita di tutti i confort..tra cui importantissima la cassaforte!. Il personale veramente molto disponibili, inoltre c'era una ragazza alla hall che parlava benissimo spagnolo e italiano (strano per i londinesi). Questo hotel si trova in una posizione comodissima; dista pochi metri (50 m) dal british museum, e si trova tra due fermate della metro, raggiungibili entrambe in meno di 2 minuti a piedi. La zona è tranquilla, centrale e ricca di ristoranti tipici! Forse il prezzo è un pò alto..ma considerando lo stile dell'hotel e la posizione, il prezzo elevato è abbastanza naturale! Ritornerò sicuramente in questo hotel la prossima volta che andrò a Londra!",4,2011,09,28
115,Siempre que voy a Londres me alojo aquí...,"Un excelente hotel. Las habitaciones son espaciosas y la ubicación es excelente, a 2 minutos del Museo Británico en pleno centro. El personal también es muy atento y amable. Es un poco caro, como casi todo en Londres, pero vale la pena. El desayuno está incluído en el pvp de la habitación y es un buffet frío sencillo pero muy bueno, consistente en quesos, embutidos, frutas, bollería y yogur.",5,2011,06,27
115,"Buen hotel, cálido y acogedor","Este hotel me gustó mucho, aunque no tuve suerte con la habitación, luego explicaré los motivos.
Es un edificio antiguo precioso, ubicado en una zona muy agradable del centro, en una calle amplia. Al entrar impresiona la recepción, realmente parece un hotel de lujo. El servicio fue encantador, tuve un problema con la reserva que solucionaron enseguida, y me subieron a la habitación un cargador de blackberry para cargar el movil.
La habitación que me tocó, que no creo que sea la habitual a juzgar por otras críticas, era muy pequeñita. De hecho la cama dobe estaba pegada a la pared, y tenía una pequeña mesa en la que no cabía nada más que la bandeja con el servicio de café y un par de revistas. Daba a un pequeño patio interior en el que se situaban los aparatosd e aire acondicionado, con lo cual el zumbido por la noche fue constante y acábé de mala uva. Eso me fastidió bastante porque había pagado un 170 libras por la habitación, pero a veces estas cosas son cuestión de suerte.
Por lo demás, muy limpio, agradable, y buen trato. El desayuno realmente excelente, aunque los huevos, bacon, etc del desayuno inglés hay que pedirlos y pagarlos aparte.
Conclusion, es un hotel muy muy recomendable, pero hay que pedir una habitación exterior o que de a la zona del patio acristalado.",4,2011,03,25
115,war sehr schön,"super Lage, fast direkt an der Oxford Street, und in der Nähe der Underground. Für London fast schon riesige Zimmer, sehr nobel und Zimmer in sehr gutem Zustand",5,2010,12,30
115,1A - Adresse in London für vernünftigen Preis,"London 's Hotel sind teuer und alt. Nicht so das Bloomsbury. Es ist relativ neu, die Räume sind hell und modern eingerichtet. Die Zimmer sind unterschiedlich eingerichtet, halten aber den hohen Ansprüchen stand. Zudem hat es in den Suiten ein riesen Bad. Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral und der Preis liegt absolut im Rahmen. Für London-Verhältnisse würde ich schon eher günstig sagen (200 - 300 EUR).",5,2010,10,28
115,Boutique hotel con excelente ubicación,"El Bloomsbury Hotel es, tal y como lo describen en su página web, un hotel “boutique” con una ubicación excelente y un personal agradable y atento. Lo que ves en las fotos, es lo que tendrás al llegar, nada de sorpresas desagradables como suele ocurrir en otros hoteles. Las habitaciones, aunque pequeñas, cuentan con todo lo necesario para una estancia agradable, aunque podrían ser más cómodas si la distribución fuese algo mejor. El baño impecable y moderno, aunque la mampara de la ducha puede resultar algo incomoda al principio. Un detalle, es que nunca tuvimos que solicitar al personal del hotel la reposición de los artículos de baño o del té y las galletas de la habitación, siempre que los necesitamos, aparecían como por “arte de magia”. 
No puede decirse que sea un hotel especialmente económico, pero su ubicación creo que lo compensa con creces. Hay al menos una estación de metro cerca y puedes llegar a Oxford St. en sólo 5 min. Particularmente no suelo utilizar el metro en mis viajes (al menos si puedo evitarlo) y puedo decir que, si te gusta caminar (como a mí), este hotel está a un perfecta distancia de todo sin estar en medio del bullicio.
Hay muchos sitios para comer en los alrededores, desde restaurantes y cafés, hasta tiendas de 24 h. No probamos la comida del hotel pero, por los comentarios de otros huéspedes, parecía que era bastante buena. Tanto los museos como las zonas comerciales más típicas de Londres están cerca del hotel. También, si te gustan los musicales, creo que encontrarás que la ubicación es bastante buena.
El personal es agradable y atento. Llegamos bastante antes de la hora del “Check in” y no tuvimos problemas en acceder a la habitación. En nuestro último día, pudimos dejar las maletas sin problemas para disfrutar un poco más de la ciudad y hacer un temprano “check out” del hotel. No puedo decir si hay personal que hable español, pero para mí esto no es un problema. Sin embargo, estuve presente en el “check in” de una chica asiática que no hablaba nada de inglés y el personal de recepción estaba haciendo todo lo posible en atenderla lo mejor posible (y no era fácil).
En resumen, es un hotel pequeño, pero cómodo. No es excesivamente lujoso y no creo que pueda considerarse particularmente económico, pero su ubicación y cuidado en los detalles (desde la limpieza, hasta su personal) creo que lo compensan. 
Sin duda es mi hotel en Londres y ya estoy planeando en volver.",4,2010,10,07
115,Un hotel ideal para una agradable estancia en Londres,"Estuvimos en este hotel para nuestra primera estancia en Londres y nos marchamos con una impresión muy positiva, especialmente teniendo en cuenta lo que se comenta siempre de los hotel en Londres.

El trato del personal del hotel fue increíblemente amable en todo momento, siempre tratando de darte toda la información y servicios que necesitases.

Está muy bien situado, quizás no en el centro neurálgico, pero si en una zona tranquila y perfecta para hacer de centro de operaciones. En la misma calle que el British Museum, cuenta con una parada de metro a la vuelta de la esquina. A pocos minutos andando del Soho, Chinatown y Covent Garden. A pocos metros también de Oxford Street con todas las tiendas.

La habitación era muy correcta y limpia. Decoración muy cuidadada y bonita. Sin ser enorme pero espaciosa, con cama buena y grande, escritorio, sofá, pantalla plana, armario grande, tabla de planchar, plancha, secador de los buenos... Tenían el típico set para que te hagas tu té o café gratis y que reponían por la mañana y por la tarde. También una regleta con enchufes internacionales (no hacía falta llevarse el adaptador). Aunque, como siempre, no hay persiana, al menos en este caso las cortinas eran lo suficientemente tupidas y pesadas como para no dejar pasar claridad y poder dormir tranquilamente. También tenían conexión por si te llevas ordenador poder conectarlo a internet por cable, además de wi-fi.

El alojamiento en Londres es caro, pero por lo que comparamos la relación calidad-precio es muy buena. Un hotel estupendamente situada por un precio bastante razonable.

Sin duda repetiríamos.",5,2010,09,16
115,Excelente trato y perfecta ubicación,"El personal de la recepción fue amabilísimo, nos cambiaron a una habitación con dos camas, ya que viajaba con mi madre, cuando inicialmente teniamos una cama de matrimonio, La habitación  comodísma, perfecta climatización y, lo más importante, totalmente aislada de ruido (a pesar de estar situada al lado del ascensor), Relación calidad-precio excelente.",5,2010,08,30
115,Bell'albergo in posizione invidiabile,"Struttura elegante senza essere troppo pretenziosa in una laterale di Tottenham Court Road. Proseguendo di 200 m si arriva al British Museum, nella direzione opposta c'è la fermata del metro di Tottenham Court Road ed il ""Dominion Theatre"".
Visto il costo abbiamo preferito risparmiare sulla colazione e farla nell'innumerevole serie di Caffè della zona.",4,2010,08,12
115,Sehr schoenes klassisches Hotel,So stellt man sich ein 5 Sterne Hotel vor. Das Zimmer war sehr gross und perfekt ausgestattet. Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral zu verschiedenen Sehenswuerdigkeiten z.B. dem Britischen Museum und U-Bahn Stationen. Das Personal war sehr aufmerksam und hilfsbereit. Es steht auch 24 Std eine Hausdame zur Verfuegung.,5,2010,07,14
115,"Ordentliches Hotel, gute Lage","Ordentliches Hotel in sehr guter Lage. Auffallend großes und gutes Frühstücksbuffet, leider im dunklem Keller. Zimmer sind sehr klein, aber sauber mit guten, neuen Betten. Die Rezeption ist leider unterbesetzt, ansonsten ist der Service aber gut und bemüht. Als Ausgangsabasis für einen Londontrip sehr gut geeignet, wobei die Standardrate relativ hoch ist.",3,2010,07,02
115,Fántastico Hotel en el centro de Londres,"Acabamos de llegar de un fin de semana largo en Londres y decidimos alojarnos en el hotel Bloomsbury. Aunque al principio dudamos entre varios, escogimso este por las críticas de otros viajeros y realmente acertamos.

El hotel está situado al lado del British Museum, una calle muy tranquila pero al lado del Soho y de Covent Garden, donde el ambiente es constante. A parte, está ideal situado para venir en metro directo desde Heathrow parando en  Holborn. En 5 minutos caminando se está en el hotel.

Las instalaciones están totalmente renovadas y las habitaciones son grandes y espaciosas. Está cuidado hasta el mínimo detalle. Lo único a comentar es que la luz del baño era demasiado ténue.

El desayuno también muuuuy bien.

Todo perfecto. Os lo recomendamos!",5,2010,05,25
115,Solo qualche piccolo inconveniente,"Appena arrivati non abbiamo trovato la camera pronta ma c'era anche qualche altro problema riguardante la prenotazione, prontamente risolto. Il riscaldamento non ha mai veramente funzionato a il bagno non era del tutto all'altezza di un quattro stelle. La posizione dell'albergo è comunque ottima, la stanza spaziosa e confortevole e il personale molto gentile,",3,2010,02,25
115,Veramente tutto bene - Consigliabilissimo,"Hotel molto pulito. La nostra camera era comoda e spaziosa. Il bagno ampio, pulito e dotato di tutto i prodotti necessari. Cambio asciugamani ogni giorno. Poltrona e Tv digitale. Prese di acorrente anche ""europee"". Asciugacapelli, ferro da stiro e asse per stirare, bollitore acqua. Personale molto cortese e attento. Colazione molto bene (ampia scelta), Hotel elegante, gradevole e tranquillo. Posizione ottima (3 minuti al metro di Tottenham Court Road). A Trafalgar square in 15 minuti a piedi e al British Museum in 5 minuti a piedi. Vicine le vie dello shopping (Oxford street e Regent Street). Tutto davvero bene. Consigliabilr. Francesco",5,2009,12,08
115,estremamente comodo,"Abbiamo trascorso al The Bloomsbury Hotel tre notti. Avevamo una doppia standard e sebbene all'arrivo ci sia sembrata un po' ""angusta"" (soffitto un po' basso, affacci nel cortile e assenza di un piano di appoggio per le valigie) devo dire che poi l'abbiamo apprezzata. La stanza oltre che perfettamente allestita con bell'arredo, grande TV lcd, bagno in marmo era anche dotata di cassetta di sicurezza, phon, asse e ferro da stiro, bollitore con scelta di tè, tutto perfettamente funzionante. La pulizia accurata.  L'hotel ha una comodissima posizione, dei buoni servizi generali ed il personale è gentile; anche i prezzi degli extra sono generalmente accettabili.... tranne forse quelli della colazione, che non abbiamo provato proprio perchè ci è sembrata eccessivamente cara anche per una tradizionale colazione inglese, soprattutto visto che nel Cafè accanto all'hotel ne offrono una davvero ottima a soli 5,50 pounds (un 1/4 del prezzo praticato in hotel).",4,2009,10,05
115,Excelente hotel y ubicación,"A cinco minutos de Covent Garden y al lado del British Museum (en la misma calle), un hotel con todas la comodidades, excelente decoración y muy buenos servicios. El personal muy amable (al menos dos recepcionistas hablan español y una de ellas catalan) y servicial. La cama muy  confortable y la habitación, a parte de bonita, bastante bien insonorizada y con conexion gratuita a internet (no es wi-fi pero hay  un cable para conectarse). Eramos ocho personas y todas nos fuimos muy contentos. Muy recomendable.",5,2009,08,22
115,Eccellente !,"Abbiamo avuto la fortuna di trovare un'offerta per questo hotel su lastminute.com e devo dire che siamo rimasti completamente soddisfatti della scelta! La posizione è centralissima, a pochi passi dalla fermata della Tube Tottenham  Court Road, dal British Museum, Soho, Oxford Street, Leicester Square...! La nostra camera superior non era troppo spaziosa ma decisamente confortevole, elegante e dotata di tutti i confort: asse da stiro, asciugacapelli, set per la preparazione di the e caffè con ampia scelta di miscele (latte, cream, dolcificante, zucchero normale o di canna, caffè decaffeinato, camomilla, biscotti) il tutto riassortito ogni giorno e ovviamente il bollitore per l'acqua. Il bagno era piccolo ma decisamente nuovo ed elegante con riscaldamento a pavimento, box doccia immacolato, cambio asciugamani giornaliero, prodotti per il corpo. Aria condizionata regolabile, tv al plasma grande, cassaforte, panca x appoggio delle valigie. Non posso dire nulla riguardo la colazione ma dal menu' in camera i prezzi erano decisamente alti (22 sterline per la colazione all'inglese ma c'era anche quella continentale un po meno costosa). Vicino alla reception c'è a disposizione degli ospiti un pc con il collegamento internet. Insomma, se torno a Londra cercherò di nuovo qualche offerta per questo hotel perchè vale veramente la pena!",5,2009,08,14
115,In una parola: stre-pi-to-so!,"Appena rientrati da weekend a Londra, confermo posizione fantastica davvero 10 minuti a piedi da Leicester Square e un minuto dalla fermata della metro Tottenham. Hotel moderno e pulito con stanze ampie, non abbiamo fatto colazione quindi non possiamo giudicare, ma forniscono minibreakfast di cortesia e acqua minerale. Gratis anche cassaforte e ferro da stiro. Spero ricapiti una simile occasione (3 notti paghi 2) ma a Londra è difficile.",5,2009,06,04
115,Nel cuore di Londra,"L'Hotel è in posizione super strategica per un weekend a Londra, tra cultura, shopping e divertimento.Si trova a pochi metri dall'ingresso del British museum, a 5 min da Oxford street, 10 min da Soho e Leicester Square, e 15 min a piedi da Covent Garden e Trafalgar Square-Piccadilly Circus.A pochi metri si trova anche il Dominion Theatre dove viene riprensetato 2 volte al giorno il musical dedicato ai Queen ""Will I rock You"".Fantastico!Le camere sono accoglienti e pulitissime, il bagno davvero nuovissimo.Sarà stato grazie alla nuova gestione, ma un'offerta così(80 pounds a notte la camera) penso che a Londra sarà introvabile.Bellissimo!
Consigliatissimo!",5,2009,05,25
